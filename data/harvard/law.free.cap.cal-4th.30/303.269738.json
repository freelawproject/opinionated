In this case, we consider whether <em>Broughton </em>is good law in light of two recent United States Supreme Court cases pertaining to arbitration, <em>Green Tree Fin. Corp.-Ala. v. Randolph </em>(2000) 531 U.S. 79 [121 S.Ct. 513, 148 L.Ed.2d 373] <em>(Green Tree) </em>and <em>Circuit City Stores, Inc. </em>v. <em>Adams </em>(2001) 532 U.S. 105 [121 S.Ct. 1302, 149 L.Ed.2d 234] <em>(Circuit City). </em>We conclude that it is.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-9\">We also consider whether <em>Broughton\u2019s </em>holding on the inarbitrability of CLRA public injunctions should be extended to include claims to enjoin unfair competition under Business and Professions Code section 17200 et seq. and to enjoin misleading advertising under Business and Professions Code section 17500 et seq. We conclude that <em>Broughton </em>should be extended to such claims, at least under the circumstances of the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-10\">We further consider whether <em>Broughton </em>should be extended to statutory and common law claims for equitable monetary relief\u2014for restitution, disgorgement, and unjust enrichment. We conclude that <em>Broughton </em>should not be thus extended.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-11\">I. Statement of Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b349-12\">In November 1999, plaintiff Jose E. Cruz filed an action against defendants PacifiCare Health Systems, Inc., and PacifiCare of California, Inc. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>(collectively PacifiCare), alleging claims for unfair competition and false advertising in connection with PacifiCare\u2019s sale, marketing, and rendering of medical services. In his first amended complaint, Cruz alleged that he was an enrollee in one of the various health plans PacifiCare offers and operates in California. He also alleged that \u201cthrough its misleading and deceptive material representations and omissions,\u201d PacifiCare has employed a \u201cfraudulent, unlawful, and/or unfair scheme designed to induce\u201d persons to enroll in its health plans by \u201cmisrepresenting . . . that its primary commitment . . . is to maintain and improve the quality of healthcare provided.\u201d In fact, Cruz alleged, PacifiCare \u201chas been aggressively engaged in implementing undisclosed systemic internal policies that are designed, <em>inter alia, </em>to discourage PacifiCare\u2019s primary care physicians from delivering medical services and to interfere with the medical judgment of PacifiCare healthcare providers.\u201d The result of these policies, he alleged, is a \u201creduction in the quality of [provided] healthcare\u201d that \u201cis directly contrary to PacifiCare\u2019s representations.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b350-4\">Cruz emphasized in his first amended complaint that he \u201cdoes not challenge the denial of medical benefits to any enrollee or subscriber,\u201d but \u201cchallenges the manner in which PacifiCare . . . induced persons to subscribe to its Health Plans ... by misrepresenting or failing to disclose internal policies that lower the quality of services provided.\u201d Cruz alleged that he was filing the action \u201cin his individual capacity and on behalf of the general public,\u201d and he sought to represent a class of \u201capproximately 1.6 million PacifiCare Health Plan enrollees in California.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b350-5\">Based on these general allegations, Cruz alleged four causes of action. In the first, he alleged that PacifiCare had violated Business and Professions Code section 17500 by \u201cengaging in false advertising\u201d that \u201creduce [d] the quality of medical services available to . . . enrollees\u201d and \u201cdecrease[d] the value of the [health coverage] for which [they] paid.\u201d To remedy this alleged violation, Cruz requested \u201can order enjoining [PacifiCare] from violating [Business and Professions Code section] 17500 and requiring [it] to disgorge ... all of [its] ill-gotten gains and monies wrongfully acquired.\u201d The second cause of action alleged that in violating various state statutes, PacifiCare had committed an unfair, unlawful, or fraudulent business act or practice under Business and Professions Code section 17200 that \u201creduce[d] the quality of medical services available to\u201d enrollees and \u201cdecrease[d] the value of their respective [h]ealth [p]lans.\u201d To remedy this alleged violation, Cruz requested \u201can order enjoining [PacifiCare] from violating [Business and Professions Code section] 17200 and requiring [it] to disgorge ... all of [its] ill-gotten gains and monies wrongfully acquired.\u201d The third cause of action alleged that PacifiCare\u2019s misrepresentations violated the CLRA (Civ. Code, \u00a7 1770). To remedy this alleged violation, Cruz requested \u201can order <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>enjoining [PacifiCare\u2019s] wrongful acts and practices\u201d and requiring that PacifiCare \u201cmake restitution ... of all monies paid to\u201d it. Cruz also stated his intent to add a request for actual damages if PacifiCare failed to remedy the damage from its violation. The fourth cause of action was for unjust enrichment, and alleged that as a result of PacifiCare\u2019s conduct, enrollees had \u201creceiv[ed] a lower quality of care than advertised and represented by\u201d PacifiCare. As to remedy, Cruz requested \u201crestitution, refund, or reimbursement of\u2019 certain monies paid by or on behalf of enrollees, and \u201cdisgorgement of the excessive and ill-gotten monies obtained by [PacifiCare] as a result of the unlawful, fraudulent, or unfair business acts and practices and untrue and misleading advertisements.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b351-5\">PacifiCare moved for an order compelling Cruz to arbitrate his claims and staying the action pending completion of arbitration. PacifiCare argued that Cruz, who obtained health coverage through his employer, was required to arbitrate his claims under several provisions of the subscriber agreement between his employer and PacifiCare. PacifiCare relied primarily on paragraph 15.02 of the subscriber agreement, which provides in part: \u201cARBITRATION. PACIFICARE USES BINDING ARBITRATION TO RESOLVE ANY AND ALL DISPUTES BETWEEN PACIFICARE AND GROUP OR MEMBER, INCLUDING . . . DISPUTES RELATING TO THE DELIVERY OF SERVICES UNDER THE PACIFICARE HEALTH PLAN. PACIFICARE, GROUP AND MEMBER EACH UNDERSTAND AND EXPRESSLY AGREE THAT BY ENTERING INTO THE PACIFICARE SUBSCRIBER AGREEMENT, PACIFICARE, GROUP AND MEMBER ARE EACH VOLUNTARILY GIVING UP THEIR CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT TO HAVE ALL SUCH DISPUTES DECIDED IN A COURT OF LAW BEFORE A JURY, AND INSTEAD ARE ACCEPTING THE USE OF BINDING ARBITRATION.\u201d PacifiCare also relied on paragraph 7.01.01 of the subscriber agreement, which establishes a procedure for \u201cMember Appeals not related to quality of care\u201d and provides that a member who is not satisfied with the outcome of PacifiCare\u2019s internal appeals process \u201cmay . . . submit or request that PacifiCare submit the Appeal to binding arbitration before the American Arbitration Association\u201d (AAA). Paragraph 7.01.01 also provides: \u201cUpon submission of a dispute to the [AAA], Member and PacifiCare agree to be bound by the rules of procedure and decision of the [AAA].\u201d Paragraph 7.01.01 concludes by stating: \u201cPACIFICARE AND MEMBER UNDERSTAND THAT BY ENTERING INTO THIS AGREEMENT, THEY ARE GIVING UP THEIR CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT TO HAVE ANY DISPUTE DECIDED IN A COURT OF LAW BEFORE A JURY AND INSTEAD ARE ACCEPTING THE USE OF ARBITRATION.\u201d PacifiCare also relied on Cruz\u2019s signed enrollment form, which stated that he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>\u201cagree[d] to and underst[ood]\u201d several terms and conditions, including: (1) \u201cTo be bound by the PacifiCare . . . Subscriber Agreement\u201d; and (2) that \u201c[ajny differences between myself . . . and PacifiCare . . . relating to PacifiCare ... or its performance are subject to binding arbitration.\u201d Finally, PacifiCare relied on the member handbook it sent to Cruz, which describes PacifiCare\u2019s internal appeals process and, for members unsatisfied with the result of that process, the option of arbitration before the AAA. The member handbook also states: \u201cMEMBERS UNDERSTAND THAT BY ENROLLING IN PACIFICARE, THEY AGREE TO GIVE UP THEIR CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT TO HAVE ANY DISPUTE DECIDED IN A COURT OF LAW BEFORE A JURY AND INSTEAD ARE ACCEPTING THE USE OF ARBITRATION FOR RESOLVING DISPUTES WITH PACIFICARE.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b352-4\">Cruz opposed PacifiCare\u2019s motion <em>on </em>several grounds. He first argued that the applicable arbitration provision does not encompass this dispute because the paragraph in the subscriber agreement requiring arbitration before the AAA governs appeals \u2018\u201cnot related to quality of care\u2019 \u201d and his complaint \u201cis <em>solely </em>. . . directed to the \u2018quality of care\u2019 provided by PacifiCare.\u201d Second, he argued that his requests for injunctive relief are inarbitrable under <em>Broughton. </em>Third, he argued that the arbitration clause is unconscionable. Finally, he argued that because PacifiCare did not enter into any agreement with either him or his employer, it may not invoke the arbitration clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-5\">PacifiCare offered several arguments in response. Regarding Cruz\u2019s contention under <em>Broughton, </em>PacifiCare argued that <em>Broughton </em>prohibits arbitration only of claims for injunctive relief under the CLRA, and does not prohibit arbitration of Cruz\u2019s \u201cmonetary\u201d claims for disgorgement, restitution and reimbursement or his request for injunctive relief under Business and Professions Code sections 17200 and 17500. Regarding the scope of arbitration, PacifiCare argued that because the language of paragraph 15.02 of the subscriber agreement requires \u201cBINDING ARBITRATION TO RESOLVE <em>ANY AND ALL </em>DISPUTES BETWEEN PACIFICARE AND GROUP OR MEMBER\u201d (italics added), it includes claims related to quality of care. Supporting this interpretation, PacifiCare asserted, is the fact that \u201cthe one example [paragraph 15.02] provides of a covered dispute\u2014 \u2018allegations against PacifiCare of medical malpractice\u2019\u2014addresses a claim involving quality of care.\u201d PacifiCare also argued that \u201ceven if \u2018quality of care\u2019 issues were exempt from arbitration,\u201d Cruz does not raise quality of care issues, and his claims therefore do not fall within this exemption. Finally, PacifiCare argued that the arbitration clause was not unconscionable.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>The trial court denied PacifiCare\u2019s motion to compel arbitration. It reasoned that <em>Broughton </em>expressly precludes arbitration of Cruz\u2019s claim for injunctive relief under the CLRA, and it \u201cextended\u201d <em>Broughton\u2019s </em>reasoning to claims for injunctive relief under Business and Professions Code sections 17200 and 17500 \u201cby an individual acting as a private attorney general.\u201d The court also reasoned that Cruz\u2019s claims for disgorgement, restitution, and unjust enrichment are inarbitrable as essentially equitable remedies distinct from damages. Given these conclusions, the court expressly declined to rule on any of Cruz\u2019s other objections to PacifiCare\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-5\">The Court of Appeal affirmed, relying on <em>Broughton </em>and rejecting PacifiCare\u2019s argument that the United States Supreme Court had abrogated <em>Broughton </em>in subsequent decisions. It also upheld the trial court\u2019s extension of <em>Broughton </em>to claims for disgorgement and restitution under Business and Professions Code section 17200 et seq., relying primarily on the public benefit derived from those remedies and the interrelationship between those remedies and injunctive relief. The court limited its holding to equitable remedies within the context of class action claims. Like the trial court, the Court of Appeal did not consider any of Cruz\u2019s other arguments against arbitration. We then granted PacifiCare\u2019s petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-6\">II. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b353-7\">A. <em>Did Green Tree and Circuit City Overrule Broughton?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b353-8\">PacifiCare contends that our decision in <em>Broughton, supra, </em>21 Cal.4th 1066, holding that injunctive relief claims under the CLRA are inarbitrable, should be overruled in light of <em>Green Tree, supra, </em>531 U.S. 79, and <em>Circuit City, supra, </em>532 U.S. 105. According to PacifiCare, these two post <em>-Broughton </em>decisions, read in conjunction with earlier United States Supreme Court decisions, make clear that only Congress\u2014and not state legislatures\u2014may create exceptions to the Federal Arbitration Act\u2019s (FAA) requirement that arbitration agreements be enforced according to their terms, and that therefore state courts cannot hold that certain requests for public injunctive relief are inarbitrable. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-9\">In <em>Broughton, </em>we recognized that the United States Supreme Court has emphasized Congress\u2019s and its own policy in favor of arbitration and, at least since 1984, has rejected numerous efforts and arguments by state courts, federal courts and litigants to declare certain classes of cases not subject to arbitration. <em>(Broughton, supra, </em>21 Cal.4th at pp. 1074-1075.) Indeed, we acknowledged the Supreme Court\u2019s broad statement in its seminal arbitration case, <em>Southland Corp. </em>v. <em>Keating </em>(1984) 465 U.S. 1, 10 [104 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>S.Ct. 852, 858, 79 L.Ed.2d 1], that \u201c \u2018[i]n enacting \u00a7 2 of the [FAA], Congress declared a national policy favoring arbitration and withdrew the power of the states to require a judicial forum for the resolution of claims which the contracting parties agreed to resolve by arbitration.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Broughton, supra, </em>21 Cal.4th at p. 1074.)</p>\n<p id=\"b354-4\">We nonetheless held that requests for injunctive relief designed to benefit the public presented a narrow exception to the rule that the FAA requires state courts to honor arbitration agreements. We reasoned that the Supreme Court has acknowledged that Congress may \u201c \u2018require a judicial forum for the resolution of claims which the contracting parties agreed to resolve by arbitration\u2019 \u201d <em>(Broughton, supra, </em>21 Cal.4th at p. 1074, quoting <em>Southland Corp. v. Keating, supra, </em>465 U.S. at p. 10 [104 S.Ct. at p. 858]), and that \u201c[t]he unsuitability of a statutory claim for arbitration turns on congressional intent, which can be discovered in the text of the statute in question, its legislative history or in an \u2018 \u201cinherent conflict\u201d between arbitration and the [statute\u2019s] underlying purposes.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Broughton, supra, </em>21 Cal.4th at p. 1075, quoting <em>Gilmer v. Interstate/Johnson Lane Corp. </em>(1991) 500 U.S. 20, 26 [111 S.Ct. 1647, 1652, 114 L.Ed.2d 26] <em>(Gilmer).)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b354-5\">We then concluded that there was indeed an inherent conflict between arbitration and the CLRA\u2019s authorization in Civil Code section 1780, subdivision (a)(2) for injunctive relief designed to protect the public, e.g., to stop deceptive business practices. As we stated: \u201c[T]here are two factors taken in combination that make for an \u2018inherent conflict\u2019 between arbitration and the underlying purpose of the CLRA\u2019s injunctive relief remedy. First, that relief is for the benefit of the general public rather than the party bringing the action.\u201d <em>(Broughton, supra, </em>21 Cal.4th at p. 1082.) In reaching this conclusion, we distinguished requests for public injunctions from other sorts of actions, such as antitrust suits, in which the public benefit is incidental to the plaintiffs award of damages; unlike private suits for damages, in a public injunction action a plaintiff acts in the purest sense as a private attorney general. <em>{Id. </em>at pp. 1075-1077.) \u201cSecond, the judicial forum has significant institutional advantages over arbitration in administering a public injunctive remedy, which as a consequence will likely lead to the diminution or frustration of the public benefit if the remedy is entrusted to arbitrators.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1082.) We reasoned that an arbitrator lacked the institutional continuity and the appropriate jurisdiction to sufficiently enforce and, if needed, modify a public injunction. <em>{Id. </em>at p. 1081.)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We concluded: \u201cGiven this inherent conflict, we will presume, absent indications <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>to the contrary, that the Legislature did not intend that the injunctive relief claims be arbitrated.\u201d <em>(Broughton, </em>at p. 1082.) We discerned no such legislative intent. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b355-5\">We further concluded that denying arbitration in this one area would not violate the FAA. As we stated: \u201c[A]lthough the court has stated generally that the capacity to withdraw statutory rights from the scope of arbitration agreements is the prerogative solely of Congress, not state courts or legislatures (So<em>uthland Corp. v. Keating, supra, </em>465 U.S. at p. 18 [104 S.Ct. at p. 862]), it has never directly decided whether a legislature may restrict a private arbitration agreement when it inherently conflicts with a public statutory purpose that transcends private interests. In the present case, as discussed, we believe there is such an inherent conflict between arbitration and a statutory injunctive relief remedy designed for the protection of the general public. Although both California and federal law recognize the important policy of enforcing arbitration agreements, it would be perverse to extend the policy so far as to preclude states from passing legislation the purposes of which make it incompatible with arbitration, or to compel states to permit the vitiation through arbitration of the substantive rights afforded by such legislation.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-6\">\u201cIn other terms, our holding does not represent a \u2018 \u201csuspicion of arbitration as a method of weakening the protections afforded in the substantive law to would-be complainants\u201d . . . \u201cout of step with our current strong endorsement of the federal statutes favoring this method of resolving disputes\u201d \u2019 [Citation.] Rather, it is a recognition that arbitration cannot necessarily afford all the advantages of adjudication in the area of private attorney general actions, that in a narrow class of such actions arbitration is inappropriate, and that this inappropriateness does not turn on the happenstance of whether the rights and remedies being adjudicated are of state or federal derivation.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>\u201cNor does anything in the legislative history of the FAA suggest that Congress contemplated \u2018public injunction\u2019 arbitration within the universe of arbitration agreements it was attempting to enforce. Indeed, the primary focus of the drafters of the FAA appears to have been on the utility of arbitration in resolving ordinary commercial disputes. [Citations.] Although the court has interpreted the FAA to extend to noncommercial statutory claims, it is doubtful Congress would have envisioned the extension of the FAA to enforce arbitral jurisdiction over a public injunction.\u201d <em>(Broughton, supra, </em>21 Cal.4th at pp. 1083-1084, fn. omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b356-4\">The recent United States Supreme Court cases cited by PacifiCare have little if any bearing on our holding in <em>Broughton. </em>In <em>Circuit City, supra, </em>532 U.S. 105, the court concluded that section 1 of the FAA, which exempts from the scope of the FAA \u201ccontracts of employment of seamen, railroad employees, or any other class of workers engaged in foreign or interstate commerce\u201d (9 U.S.C. \u00a7 1), did not exempt most employment contracts. The opinion was principally concerned with an analysis of the meaning of section 1, not the preemptive scope of section 2. The majority rejected the position of various amici curiae, including attorneys general of 22 states, who argued that applying the FAA to employment contracts would interfere with the employment policies of the states. In rejecting this argument, the court reaffirmed <em>Southland, </em>and declined to \u201cchip away\u201d at that case by what the majority termed \u201can unconventional reading\u201d of section 1. <em>(Circuit City, supra, </em>532 U.S. at p. 122 [121 S.Ct. at p. 1313].) <em>Broughton, </em>of course, was neither predicated on overruling <em>Southland </em>nor on construing section 1 of the FAA. The <em>Circuit City </em>court did not address the central question in <em>Brough</em>ton\u2014whether public injunctions were arbitrable. Nor did it shed any further light on the \u201cinherently incompatible\u201d exception to arbitrability.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-5\">Still less is <em>Green Tree, supra, </em>531 U.S. 79, relevant to <em>Broughton. </em>That case was narrowly focused on the issue of cost sharing in the arbitration of federal statutory claims. <em>Green Tree\u2019s </em>holding did not concern federal preemption of state arbitration claims. Nor did its reiteration of Congress\u2019s strong pro-arbitration policy <em>(id. </em>at p. 92 [121 S.Ct. at pp. 522-523]) call <em>Broughton </em>into question. As discussed above, <em>Broughton </em>takes such a policy as a given. <em>(Broughton, supra, </em>21 Cal.4th at pp. 1074-1075.)</p>\n<p id=\"b356-6\">In sum, nothing that is novel about <em>Green Tree </em>or <em>Circuit City </em>has any bearing on <em>Broughton. </em>The only parts of these opinions that remotely pertain to <em>Broughton </em>are recapitulations of familiar themes regarding the importance of enforcing arbitration agreements and the inability of states to prevent that enforcement. These were amply considered in <em>Broughton. </em>Moreover, we were presented in <em>Broughton </em>with extensive argument that CLRA public <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>injunctions were arbitrable. (See <em>Broughton, supra, </em>21 Cal.4th at pp. 1088-1103 (dis. opn. of Chin, J.).) We decline PacifiCare\u2019s invitation to revisit this argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-5\">B. <em>Are Injunctions Under Business and Professions Code Sections 17200 and 17500 Arbitrable?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b357-7\">PacifiCare contends that even if we affirm our holding in <em>Broughton </em>that claims for injunctive relief under the CLRA are inarbitrable, the same should not hold true for injunctive relief claims under the unfair competition law (UCL), Business and Professions Code section 17200 et seq., and claims of false advertising under Business and Professions Code section 17500. We disagree under the circumstances of the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-8\">The UCL is intended to proscribe \u201cunfair or fraudulent business act[s] or practice[s] and unfair, deceptive, untrue or misleading advertising . . . .\u201d (Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7 17200.) The law provides that any person engaged in unfair competition may be enjoined. <em>(Id., </em>\u00a7 17203.) Moreover, \u201c[standing to sue under the UCL is expansive .... Unfair competition actions can be brought by a public prosecutor or \u2018by any person acting for the interests of itself, its members or the general public.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Korea Supply Co. </em>v. <em>Lockheed Martin Corp. </em>((2003) 29 Cal.4th 1134, 1143 [131 Cal.Rptr.2d 29, 63 P.3d 937] <em>(Korea Supply), </em>quoting Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7 17204.) The UCL is intended to protect competitors as well as consumers from unfair practices. <em>(Tippett v. Terich </em>(1995) 37 Cal.App.4th 1517, 1536 [44 Cal.Rptr.2d 862].) Thus, there may be occasions in which the injunctive power of the UCL is used primarily to redress injuries to competing businesses and only incidentally for the public benefit. (See, e.g., <em>Cel-Tech Communications, Inc. </em>v. <em>Los Angeles Cellular Telephone Co. </em>(1999) 20 Cal.4th 163, 188-190 [83 Cal.Rptr.2d 548, 973 P.2d 527].) <em>In Broughton, </em>we declined to decide whether requests for injunctive relief designed primarily to rectify individual wrongs were arbitrable. <em>(Broughton, supra, 21 </em>Cal.4th at p. 1080, fn. 5.)</p>\n<p id=\"b357-9\">We need not decide whether UCL injunctive relief actions brought by injured business competitors are arbitrable. In the present case, the request for injunctive relief is clearly for the benefit of health care consumers and the general public by seeking to enjoin PacifiCare\u2019s alleged deceptive advertising practices. The claim is virtually indistinguishable from the CLRA claim that was at issue in <em>Broughton. (Broughton, supra, 21 </em>Cal.4th at p. 1072 [Broughton sought to enjoin health care company\u2019s alleged deceptive advertising of its medical services].)</p>\n<p id=\"b357-10\">The same is true of Cruz\u2019s request to enjoin PacifiCare\u2019s alleged misleading advertising under Business and Professions Code section 17500. That <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>section makes unlawful \u201cuntrue or misleading\u201d statements designed to \u201cinduce the public to enter into any obligation\u201d to purchase various goods and services. <em>(Ibid) </em>Section 17535 authorizes the enjoining of such statements by various government officials and members of the public. Cruz\u2019s injunctive relief claim under section 17535 is essentially requesting the same relief for the same reason as is his UCL claim. (See <em>Committee on Children\u2019s Television, Inc. v. General Foods Corp. </em>(1983) 35 Cal.3d 197, 210 [197 Cal.Rptr. 783, 673 P.2d 660] [same false advertising claim may give rise to actions under the UCL and Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7 17500].) In other words, Cruz\u2019s action to enjoin PacifiCare\u2019s alleged deceptive business practices is undertaken for the public benefit, whether designated as a claim under the CLRA or Business and Professions Code section 17200 or section 17500: it is designed to prevent further harm to the public at large rather than to redress or prevent injury to a plaintiff. As such, for the reasons discussed in <em>Broughton, </em>there is an \u201c \u2018inherent conflict\u2019 between arbitration and the underlying purpose of [those statutes\u2019] injunctive relief remedy.\u201d <em>(Broughton, supra, </em>21 Cal.4th at p. 1082.)</p>\n<p id=\"b358-4\">We therefore conclude that Cruz\u2019s injunctive relief claim is inarbitrable unless there are indications of legislative intent to the contrary in the UCL or Business and Professions Code section 17500. <em>(Broughton, supra, </em>21 Cal.4th at p. 1082.) We discern no such intent. Business and Professions Code sections 17203 and 17535 both provide that injunctive relief claims are to be brought in \u201cany <em>court </em>of competent jurisdiction.\u201d (Italics added.) PacifiCare points to certain features in the CLRA not present in the UCL, such as the CLRA antiwaiver provision (Civ. Code, \u00a7 1751) and the fact that it provides for more extensive remedies than the UCL or Business and Professions Code section 17500 (Civ. Code, \u00a7 1780). (See <em>Broughton, supra, </em>21 Cal.4th at p. 1077.) But these were not the characteristics we relied on in concluding that requests for injunctive relief under the CLRA are inarbitrable. <em>(Broughton, </em>at p. 1082.) The absence of these features in the UCL or in Business and Professions Code section 17500 does not persuade us that the Legislature intended to allow arbitration of public injunctive relief requests under these statutes. We therefore conclude that each of Cruz\u2019s injunctive relief requests is inarbitrable.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b359-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>C. <em>Are Cruz\u2019s Claims for Restitution and Disgorgement Under the UCL Arbitrable?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b359-6\">PacifiCare contends the Court of Appeal erred in extending <em>Broughton </em>to hold that claims for restitution and disgorgement under the UCL are inarbitrable. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-7\">In <em>Broughton, </em>we held that damages claims under the CLRA are arbitrable, notwithstanding the fact that such claims vindicate important statutory rights. After reviewing United States Supreme Court precedent regarding the arbitration of antitrust and other federal statutory claims, we concluded that such precedent establishes that \u201cstatutory damages claims are fully arbitrable. Such an action is primarily for the benefit of a party to the arbitration, even if the action incidentally vindicates important public interests. [Citation.] In the context of statutory damage claims, the United States Supreme Court has consistently rejected plaintiffs\u2019 arguments that abbreviated discovery, arbitration\u2019s inability to establish binding precedent, and a plaintiffs right to a jury trial render the arbitral forum inadequate, or that submission of resolution of the claims to arbitration is in any sense a waiver of the substantive rights afforded by statute. [Citations.] \u2018By agreeing to arbitrate a statutory claim, a party does not forgo the substantive rights afforded by the statute; it only submits to their resolution in an arbitral, rather than a judicial, forum.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Broughton, supra, </em>21 Cal.4th at p. 1084.)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b359-8\">Under the UCL, remedies are limited. \u201cA UCL action is equitable in nature; damages cannot be recovered. [Citation.] . . . \u2018[Prevailing plaintiffs are generally limited to injunctive relief and restitution.\u2019\u201d <em>(Korea Supply, supra, 29 </em>Cal.4th at p. 1144.) In the UCL context, an order for restitution is an order \u201ccompelling a UCL defendant to return money obtained through an unfair business practice to those persons in interest from whom the property was taken, that is, to persons who had an ownership interest in the property or those claiming through that person.\u201d <em>(Kraus </em>v. <em>Trinity Management Services, Inc. </em>(2000) 23 Cal.4th 116, 126-127 [96 Cal.Rptr.2d 485, 999 P.2d 718], fn. omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b359-9\">As we noted in <em>Cortez v. Purolator Air Filtration Products Co. </em>(2000) 23 Cal.4th 163, 173 [96 Cal.Rptr.2d 518, 999 P.2d 706], Civil Code section 3281 defines \u201cdamages\u201d: \u201cEvery person who suffers detriment from the unlawful act or omission of another, may recover from the person in fault <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>a compensation therefor in money, which is called damages.\u201d We concluded that damages, thus broadly defined, \u201cmay include a restitutionary element.\u201d <em>(Cortez, supra, </em>23 Cal.4th at p. 174.) Given this overlap, there appears to be no reason why restitutionary claims, like CLRA claims for damages, should not be arbitrable. Nothing in Broughton\u2019s functional analysis suggests that the mere designation of restitution as an equitable remedy makes the request for the remedy inarbitrable. Moreover, although Cruz argues that restitution under the UCL accomplishes a public purpose by deterring unlawful conduct, the same could be said of damages under the CLRA or under various federal statutes. This deterrent effect is, however, incidental to the private benefits obtained from those bringing the restitutionary or damages action. <em>(Broughton, supra, </em>21 Cal.4th at p. 1084.) The Supreme Court has made clear that such actions, notwithstanding the public benefit, are fully arbitrable under the FAA. <em>(Ibid..)</em><footnotemark><em>4</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b360-4\">The Court of Appeal in the present case expressly limited its holding of inarbitrability to UCL class action suits. A class action may be primarily for the public benefit. But public benefit is only <em>one </em>of the factors we identified in <em>Broughton </em>as weighing in favor of the action\u2019s inarbitrability. <em>(Broughton, supra, </em>21 Cal.4th at p. 1082.) The other factor, the \u201cinstitutional advantages\u201d of the judicial forum over arbitration in the administration of a public injunction, is not present. <em>(Ibid.) </em>It may be the case that under the UCL, a class action would allow for disgorgement into a fluid recovery fund and distribution by various means. (See <em>Kraus </em>v. <em>Trinity Management Services, Inc., supra, </em>23 Cal.4th at pp. 127, 137; <em>Korea Supply, supra, </em>29 Cal.4th at p. 1148, fn. 6.) But the establishment of such a fund and the distribution of its proceeds does not present the same order of institutional difficulty as does the maintenance of a permanent statewide injunction requiring judicial supervision. We agree with the one published case on this issue that \u201c[u]n-like a public injunction, disgorgement of funds does not need to be continuously monitored because its object is limited in time and scope. Once the profits to be disgorged and the recipients of those funds are identified, there is no need for long term modification and correction necessitating judicial supervision. Therefore, . . . disgorgement of funds is essentially the same as awarding money damages, and within the power of the arbitrators to award. [T]here is no \u2018inherent conflict\u2019 between this remedy and arbitration.\u201d (Ar<em>riaga v. Cross Country Bank </em>(S.D.Cal. 2001) 163 F.Supp.2d 1189, 1197.)</p>\n<p id=\"b361-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>Moreover, in this state we recognize classwide arbitration as a means of bringing collective legal action by parties bound to an arbitration agreement. <em>(Keating v. Superior Court </em>(1982) 31 Cal.3d 584, 612-613 [183 Cal.Rptr. 360, 645 P.2d 1192], overruled on other grounds in <em>Southland Corp. </em>v. <em>Keating, supra, </em>465 U.S. 1; <em>Blue Cross of California </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1998) 67 Cal.App.4th 42 [78 Cal.Rptr.2d 779].) Without addressing questions not before us, we anticipate that courts may find it appropriate to become involved in supervising the equitable distribution of assets resulting from a class recovery, assuming entitlement to such recovery has been established. But we foresee that they would be able to do so without becoming involved in the merits of the underlying dispute. The same cannot be said for the supervision, continued enforcement, and modification of a public injunction, wherein judicial involvement would appear to be both inevitable and desirable. (See <em>Broughton, supra, </em>21 Cal.4th at pp. 1080-1082.)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b361-5\">Amici Curiae Trial Lawyers for Public Justice et al. argue that a recent United States Supreme Court case, <em>EEOC </em>v. <em>Waffle House, Inc. </em>(2002) 534 U.S. 279 [122 S.Ct. 754, 151 L.Ed.2d 755], supports their position that all UCL claims are inarbitrable. In <em>Waffle House, </em>the Supreme Court majority held that the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) may sue employers not only when it seeks to enjoin discriminatory employment practices, but also for victim-specific relief, such as reinstatement and backpay, even when the employee on whose behalf it is acting is a party to a binding arbitration agreement. The court reasoned that the EEOC was neither a party to the arbitration agreement nor a mere proxy for the employee on whose behalf the action was brought, but rather an agency charged by Congress with the vindication of the public interest. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 288-291 [122 S.Ct. at pp. 761-762].) The court noted their conclusion might have differed if the EEOC could prosecute the action without the employee\u2019s consent, or if the employee had the final say in the EEOC\u2019s prayer for relief. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 291 [122 S.Ct. at p. 763].) The three-person dissent agreed with the majority that the EEOC was not bound by employee arbitration agreements when it pursued non-victim-specific relief, but would have held that it was prevented by the arbitration agreement from bringing an action for victim-specific relief on those employees\u2019 behalf. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 298 [122 S.Ct. at pp. 766-767] (dis. opn. of Thomas, J.).)</p>\n<p id=\"b362-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>Amici curiae compare the private attorney general action brought under Business and Professions Code section 17204 with an action brought by the EEOC, and argue that anyone acting in a private attorney general capacity should not be bound by an arbitration agreement.  But in light of the United States Supreme Court\u2019s strong presumption in favor of enforcing arbitration agreements reviewed above, we do not read <em>Waffle House </em>as permitting a party to an arbitration agreement to evade its contractual obligation to settle its own restitutionary claims through arbitration merely by acting as a representative on behalf of other similarly situated claimants.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b362-4\">We therefore conclude that Cruz\u2019s actions for restitution and/or disgorgement, whether brought as an individual or as a class action, are arbitrable.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> By the same logic, his common law claim for unjust enrichment, which is essentially an action for restitution (see <em>Lauriedale Associates Ltd. v. Wilson </em>(1992) 7 Cal.App.4th 1439, 1448 [9 Cal.Rptr.2d 774]), is also arbitrable.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-5\">Finally, we note that when there is a severance of arbitrable from inarbitrable claims, the trial court has the discretion to stay proceedings on the inarbitrable claims pending resolution of the arbitration. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1281.4; <em>Madden </em>v. <em>Kaiser Foundation Hospitals </em>(1976) 17 Cal.3d 699, 714 [131 Cal.Rptr. 882, 552 P.2d 1178].) We agree with the Court of Appeal in <em>Coast Plaza Doctors Hospital v. Blue Cross of California, supra, </em>83 Cal.App.4th at page 693, that such a stay is generally in order under these circumstances. \u201cA stay is appropriate where \u2018[i]n the absence of a stay, the continuation of the proceedings in the trial court disrupts the arbitration proceedings and can render them ineffective.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em><footnotemark><em>8</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b363-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>III. Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b363-5\">Although Cruz\u2019s monetary equitable relief claims are not inherently inarbitrable, he contends, as noted, that the arbitration agreement should not be enforced for other reasons, such as because his claims are outside the scope of the arbitration agreement and because the agreement is unconscionable. The trial court, holding all of the claims inarbitrable per se, did not address these contentions. These objections to arbitration may be reasserted on remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-6\">The judgment of the Court of Appeal is affirmed in part and reversed in part, and the cause is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-7\">George, C. J., Kennard, J., and Reardon, J., <footnotemark>*</footnotemark> concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b354-6\"> Justice Chin\u2019s concurring and dissenting opinion finds significant the United States Supreme Court\u2019s holding that a decision of the New York Court of Appeals, <em>Garrity v. Lyle Stuart, Inc. </em>(1976) 40 N.Y.2d 354 [386 N.Y.S.2d 831, 353 N.E.2d 793, 83 A.L.R.3d 1024], <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>prohibiting arbitration of punitive damages claims, is preempted by the FAA. <em>(Mastrobuono </em>v. <em>Shearson Lehman Hutton, Inc. </em>(1995) 514 U.S. 52, 58 [115 S.Ct. 1212, 1216-1217, 131 L.Ed.2d 76].) In particular, the opinion points to the Supreme Court\u2019s implicit rejection of <em>Garrity\u2019s </em>rationale that punitive damage awards require \u201crather close judicial supervision\u201d that would be lacking in arbitration. <em>(Garrity, supra, </em>386 N.Y.S.2d at p. 834 [353 N.E.2d at p. 796].) Yet it is evident that what <em>Garrity </em>meant by \u201cjudicial supervision\u201d was simply adequate judicial and appellate review of punitive damage awards, not the ongoing monitoring, enforcement, and modification that is required of public injunctions. (See <em>id. </em>at p. 835 [353 N.E.2d at p. 797.].) As we have recognized, the supposed inadequacy of judicial review of arbitration awards is not grounds for holding a claim inarbitrable, even when the arbitration involves a matter of public importance. <em>(Broughton, supra, </em>21 Cal.4th at p. 1086.) Moreover, punitive damages, unlike public injunctions, confer a direct benefit on the plaintiffs seeking them, and are in principle little different from the treble damages antitrust awards that we acknowledged in <em>Broughton </em>to be fully arbitrable. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 1075-1076.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b358-5\"> We note that the Courts of Appeal that have considered this issue have reached a similar conclusion.

The unavailability of classwide arbitration would not alter our conclusion in the present case. As the Supreme Court has stated in rejecting the argument that the unavailability of classwide relief is grounds for not enforcing an arbitration agreement: \u201c \u2018[E]ven if the arbitration could not go forward as a class action or class relief could not be granted by the arbitrator, the fact that [a statute] provides for the possibility of bringing a collective action does not mean that individual attempts at conciliation were intended to be barred.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Gilmer, supra, </em>500 U.S. at p. 32 [111 S.Ct. at p. 1655].)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b362-6\"> Although we do not agree with amici curiae that <em>Waffle House </em>requires us to extend <em>Broughton, </em>neither do we agree with Justice Chin\u2019s concurring and dissenting opinion that the former case requires us to overrule the latter. (Cone. &amp; dis. opn. of Chin, J., <em>post, </em>at p. 335.) As we have discussed, <em>Waffle House </em>recognizes that the EEOC\u2019s action on behalf of parties to an arbitration agreement in order to vindicate the public interest is not confined to injunctions, but can encompass the full range of victim-specific relief. But it does not follow, either logically or intuitively, that all forms of relief must therefore be arbitrable for private parties bound by arbitration agreements. For reasons explained above, and in <em>Broughton, </em>we hold that for consumers bound by arbitration agreements, public injunctions are inarbitrable. Nothing in <em>Waffle House </em>contradicts or calls into question that conclusion. If anything, <em>Waffle House </em>suggests the Supreme Court\u2019s agreement that a party acting <em>entirely </em>on behalf of the public\u2014in the EEOC\u2019s case in all of its actions and in Cruz\u2019s case when he pursues a public injunction\u2014acts beyond the scope of any arbitration agreement.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b362-7\"> The question whether someone who is not a party to an arbitration agreement may bring a representative action pursuant to Business and Professions Code section 17204 for restitution on behalf of injured consumers who are parties to the arbitration agreement is one that is not before us, and about which we express no opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b362-8\"> In his brief, Cruz argues for the first time that under an FAA exemption established by the federal McCarran-Ferguson Act (15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1011 et seq.), the FAA does not apply to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>arbitration agreement in this case.

In <em>Broughton </em>v. <em>Cigna Healthplans </em>(1999) 21 Cal.4th 1066 [90 Cal.Rptr.2d 334, 988 P.2d 67] <em>(Broughton), </em>this court articulated the principle that, notwithstanding the FAA, California may act in contravention of that policy by requiring a judicial forum for public injunction requests that parties contracting in interstate commerce have agreed to resolve by arbitration. There we held that claims by one party against another for public injunctive relief under our state\u2019s Consumers Legal Remedies Act (CLRA) were inarbitrable despite the parties\u2019 agreement to arbitrate all their disputes.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-9\">I joined the majority opinion in <em>Broughton, supra, </em>21 Cal.4th 1066. But as Justice Chin cogently and compellingly explains in his concurring and dissenting opinion herein, Broughton\u2019s reasoning has been undermined by three subsequent decisions of the United States Supreme Court: <em>EEOC </em>v. <em>Waffle House, Inc. </em>(2002) 534 U.S. 279 [122 S.Ct. 754, 151 L.Ed.2d 755]; <em>Circuit City Stores, Inc. </em>v. <em>Adams </em>(2001) 532 U.S. 105 [121 S.Ct. 1302, 149 L.Ed.2d 234]; and <em>Green Tree Fin. Corp.-Ala. v. Randolph </em>(2000) 531 U.S. 79 [121 S.Ct. 513, 148 L.Ed.2d 373]. Accordingly, while I concur fully in the majority\u2019s conclusion here that plaintiff Jose E. Cruz\u2019s claims for restitution, disgorgement, and unjust enrichment are arbitrable pursuant to the parties\u2019 agreement, I cannot join in its determination to follow and extend <em>Broughton </em>to bar arbitration of plaintiffs requests for injunctive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>relief under the CLRA, the unfair competition law (UCL) (Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7 17200 et seq.), and Business and Professions Code section 17500.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-4\">Not only do the recent Supreme Court authorities cast grave doubt on <em>Broughton's </em>legal analysis and conclusion, but as Justice Chin also points out, claims under the UCL are easily alleged in the context of business activities. (Cone. &amp; dis. opn. of Chin, J., <em>post, </em>at p. 339.) Therefore, extending <em>Broughton </em>to UCL injunctive relief requests will surely frustrate the legitimate contract expectations of a great many who seek to secure the benefits of a nonjudicial forum for resolving their disputes. Indeed, virtually every lawsuit involving a business entity will be subject to compounded costs and delayed resolution of claims when bifurcated litigation of the suit proceeds one part after the other in dual fora: first, an arbitration proceeding in which any UCL-based restitution, disgorgement, and unjust enrichment claims and any non-UCL damages claims are resolved; and second, a judicial action in which the UCL claims seeking public injunctive relief are litigated. (See maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 320.) This additional consideration is a paramount one that further contributed to my reevaluation of <em>Broughton.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b364-5\">For all the foregoing reasons, I hereby dissent from the majority\u2019s decision that plaintiffs requests for injunctive relief are inarbitrable.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"AFM\">CHIN, J., Concurring and Dissenting.</author>\n<p id=\"Ayp\">I concur in the majority\u2019s holding I that the claims of plaintiff Jose E.

Code, \u00a7 1750 et seq.), the unfair competition law (UCL) (Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7 17200 et seq.), and Business and Professions Code section 17500 are not arbitrable. <em>Broughton's </em>holding that CLRA claims for so-called public injunctive relief are not arbitrable is inconsistent and incompatible with the United States Supreme Court\u2019s binding construction of the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA) (9 U.S.C. \u00a7 1 et seq.) in three post <em>-Broughton </em>decisions: <em>Circuit City Stores, Inc. </em>v. <em>Adams </em>(2001) 532 U.S. 105 [121 S.Ct. 1302, 149 L.Ed.2d 234] <em>(Circuit City), EEOC v.

Randolph </em>(2000) 531 U.S. 79 [121 S.Ct. 513, 148 L.Ed.2d 373] <em>(Green Tree). </em>Moreover, given the ease with which a plaintiff may allege a claim under the UCL, the majority\u2019s extension of <em>Broughton </em>to UCL claims destroys the enforceability of arbitration agreements and eviscerates the public policy\u2014expressly established by both the California Legislature and the United States Congress\u2014that strongly favors enforcement of arbitration agreements according to their terms. Finally, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>majority sacrifices this public policy for no good reason; even if we hold an individual plaintiff to his or her agreement to arbitrate, under this court\u2019s prior construction of the UCL, the Attorney General of California and any other California citizen who has not signed an arbitration agreement may bring a court action for injunctive relief to protect the public and vindicate the public interest in enforcement of the statutes here in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-5\">I. The FAA Preempts State Laws That Limit the Enforceability of Arbitration Agreements.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-6\">In enacting the FAA, Congress \u201cintended to \u2018revers[e] centuries of judicial hostility to arbitration agreements,\u2019 [citation], by \u2018placing] [them] \u201cupon the same footing as other contracts.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>(Shearson/American Express Inc. v.

Section 2 of the FAA provides: \u201cA written provision in ... a contract evidencing a transaction involving [interstate] commerce to settle by arbitration a controversy thereafter arising out of such contract or transaction, . . . shall be valid, irrevocable, and enforceable, save upon such grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract.\u201d (9 U.S.C. \u00a7 2.) This provision \u201crequires courts to enforce privately negotiated agreements to arbitrate, like other contracts, in accordance with their terms\u201d <em>(Volt Info. Sciences v.

According to the court, in enacting section 2 of the FAA, Congress \u201cwithdrew the power of the states to require a judicial forum for the resolution of claims which the contracting parties agreed to resolve by arbitration\u201d <em>(Southland, supra, </em>465 U.S. at p. 10 [104 S.Ct. at p. 858]) in order \u201cto foreclose state legislative attempts to undercut the enforceability of arbitration agreements.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 16 [104 S.Ct. at p. 861], fn. omitted.) Thus, \u201cthe FAA ensures\u201d that an agreement to arbitrate specified claims \u201cwill be enforced according to its terms <em>even if a rule of state law would otherwise exclude such claims from </em>arbitration.\u201d <em>(Mastrobuono, supra, </em>514 U.S. at p. 58 [115 S.Ct. at p. 1216], italics added.) <em>\u201c[A]ny . . . </em>state policy\u201d that purports to invalidate an arbitration clause in a contract that is otherwise enforceable under state law is <em>\u201cunlawful, </em>for that kind of policy would place arbitration clauses on an unequal \u2018footing,\u2019 directly contrary to the [FAA\u2019s] language and Congress\u2019 intent.

They alleged in part that the defendant had violated the CLRA by deceptively advertising the quality of medical services provided under its health plan. <em>(Broughton, supra, </em>21 Cal.4th at p. 1072.)

The majority opinion in <em>Broughton </em>concluded the California Legislature \u201cdid not intend\u201d that requests under the CLRA for \u201cthis type of injunctive relief ... be arbitrated.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1080.) This conclusion rested on \u201ctwo factors.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1082.) First, according to <em>Broughton, </em>\u201cthe evident purpose of the [CLRA\u2019s] injunctive relief provision ... is ... to remedy a public wrong\u201d and to protect \u201cthe general public\u201d from \u201cbeing victimized by the same deceptive practices as the plaintiff suffered,\u201d not to \u201ccompensat[e]\u201d the plaintiff who brings and pursues the CLRA claim. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1080.) \u201cIn other words,\u201d <em>Broughton </em>continued, \u201cthe plaintiff in a CLRA damages action is playing the role of a bona fide private attorney general. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Ibid) </em>Second, <em>Broughton </em>found that private arbitration is \u201cinherent[ly] unsuitable] . . . as a means of resolving\u201d CLRA injunction requests. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1088.) <em>Broughton </em>based this finding on the view that \u201cprivate arbitration\u201d has several \u201cinstitutional shortcomings ... in the field of such public injunctions,\u201d specifically: (1) arbitrators are not \u201caccountable to the public\u201d; (2) \u201ccontinuing supervision of an injunction\u201d is problematic because arbitrators \u201care not necessarily bound by earlier decisions of other arbitrators in the same case\u201d and are \u201cunconstrained by judicial review\u201d; (3) \u201can arbitration award does not have collateral estoppel effect in favor of nonparties to an arbitration unless the arbitral parties so agree\u201d; and (4) \u201cmodification or vacation of [arbitral] injunctions involves the cumbersome process of initiating a new arbitration proceeding.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1081.) According to <em>Broughton, </em>these \u201ctwo factors taken in combination . . . make for an \u2018inherent conflict\u2019 between arbitration and the underlying purpose of the CLRA\u2019s injunctive relief remedy.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1082.) Based on this \u201cinherent conflict,\u201d <em>Broughton </em>\u201cpresume[dj . . . the Legislature did not intend that [CLRA] injunctive relief claims be arbitrated,\u201d and found no \u201cindications\u201d of a contrary legislative intent to overcome this presumption. <em>(Ibid) </em>In reaching this conclusion, <em>Broughton </em>held that despite the express statutory declaration in Code of Civil Procedure section 1281 that arbitration agreements are \u201cvalid, enforceable and irrevocable, save upon such grounds as exist for the revocation of any contract,\u201d the Legislature \u201cmay express its intention to make a statutory right inarbitrable . . . implicitly in those rare circumstances in which the fulfillment of the statutory purpose inherently conflicts with arbitration.\u201d <em>(Broughton, supra, </em>21 Cal.4th at p. 1082, fn. 7.)</p>\n<p id=\"b367-6\"><em>Broughton </em>next found that this construction of the CLRA, although invalidating agreements to arbitrate CLRA injunction requests, did not violate the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>FAA. <em>(Broughton, supra, </em>21 Cal.4th at pp. 1082-1084.) Relying on <em>Gilmer v. Interstate/Johnson Lane Corp. </em>(1991) 500 U.S. 20 [111 S.Ct. 1647, 114 L.Ed.2d 26] <em>(Gilmer), Broughton </em>concluded that despite the FAA, a court may invalidate an arbitration agreement if it finds, based on an \u201c \u2018inherent conflict\u2019 \u201d between arbitration and a <em>state </em>statutory right or remedy, that the state legislature intended to prohibit arbitration of claims involving that state right or remedy. <em>(Broughton, supra, </em>21 Cal.4th at pp. 1082-1083.) <em>Broughton </em>acknowledged that the high court had \u201crecognize[d] an \u2018inherent conflict\u2019 exception\u201d to the FAA only with respect to <em>\u201cfederal </em>statutory claims,\u201d and that <em>Gilmer </em>and the other high court cases discussing that exception \u201coccurred in the context of an inquiry into whether <em>Congress </em>had intended federal statutory claims to be exempt from arbitration.\u201d <em>(Ibid., </em>first italics added.) Citing <em>Southland, Broughton </em>also recognized that \u201cthe [high] court has stated generally that the capacity to withdraw statutory rights from the scope of arbitration agreements is the prerogative solely of Congress, not state courts or legislatures [citation] . . . .\u201d <em>(Broughton, supra, </em>21 Cal.4th at p. 1083.) Nevertheless, according to <em>Broughton, </em>the high court\u2019s FAA preemption decisions \u201cha[d] never directly decided whether a legislature may restrict a private arbitration agreement when it inherently conflicts with a public statutory purpose that transcends private interests.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) Broughton </em>also reasoned that \u201cit would be perverse to extend the policy [of the FAA] so far as to preclude states from passing legislation the purposes of which make it incompatible with arbitration . . . .\u201d <em>(Ibid) </em>Finally, <em>Broughton </em>reasoned that the \u201cinappropriateness\u201d of arbitration as a means for resolving certain \u201cprivate attorney general actions . . . does not turn on the happenstance of whether the rights and remedies being adjudicated are of state or federal derivation.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) Broughton </em>thus concluded that notwithstanding the high court\u2019s pronouncement that \u201cthe FAA pre-empts state laws which \u2018require a judicial forum for the resolution of claims which the contracting parties agreed to resolve by arbitration\u2019 \u201d <em>(Volt, supra, </em>489 U.S. at p. 478 [109 S.Ct. at p. 1255]), state legislatures and state courts may require a judicial forum for public injunction requests that contracting parties have agreed to resolve by arbitration.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-4\">Though invalidating agreements to arbitrate CLRA injunction requests, <em>Broughton </em>also held that agreements to arbitrate CLRA claims for damages are enforceable, \u201cat least to the extent the FAA governs such claims.\u201d <em>(Broughton, supra, </em>21 Cal.4th at p. 1084.) <em>Broughton </em>stated that the CLRA \u201cmight be interpreted\u201d as requiring that CLRA damage claims \u201cbe resolved solely in a judicial forum.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>However, <em>Broughton </em>also explained: \u201c[A]s [the high court\u2019s decisions] make clear, statutory damages claims are fiilly arbitrable [under the FAA]. Such an action is primarily for the benefit of a party to the arbitration, even if the action incidentally vindicates important <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>public interests. [Citation.] In the context of statutory damages claims, the [high court] has consistently rejected [the] arguments that abbreviated discovery, arbitration\u2019s inability to establish binding precedent, and a plaintiffs right to a jury trial render the arbitral forum inadequate, or that submission of resolution of the claims to arbitration is in any sense a waiver of the substantive rights afforded by statute. [Citations.] \u2018By agreeing to arbitrate a statutory claim, a party does not forgo the substantive rights afforded by the statute; it only submits to their resolution in an arbitral, rather than a judicial, forum.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>\u201cThus,\u201d in order to make the CLRA \u201cconsistent with the FAA,\u201d <em>Broughton </em>\u201cinterpreted] the CLRA as permitting arbitration of damages claims, at least to the extent the FAA governs such claims.\u201d <em>(Ibid)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b369-5\">III. The High Court\u2019s Post <em>-Broughton </em>Decisions Require That We Overrule <em>Broughton.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b369-7\">Since we decided <em>Broughton, </em>the high court has issued three relevant arbitration decisions. The high court\u2019s statements in these three decisions require us to overrule Broughton's holding that California may prohibit enforcement of agreements to arbitrate CLRA requests for public injunctions.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-8\">The first <em>decision\u2014Circuit </em>City\u2014directly refutes one of <em>Broughton's </em>critical premises: that <em>Gilmer's </em>\u201cinherent conflict\u201d exception to the FAA may apply based on the intent of a <em>state </em>legislature\u2014as opposed to Congress\u2014 and that a state legislature therefore may, notwithstanding the FAA, prohibit enforcement of an arbitration agreement where the legislature concludes that arbitration inherently conflicts with a statutory right or remedy. In <em>Circuit City, </em>the high court construed the FAA to apply to \u201call contracts of employment\u201d except those of \u201ctransportation workers.\u201d <em>(Circuit City, supra, </em>532 U.S. at p. 109 [121 S.Ct. at p. 1306].) Opposing this conclusion, \u201c[v]arious <em>amici, </em>including the attorneys general of 21 States,\u201d argued that this broad construction of the FAA would \u201cintrude^ upon the policies of the separate States\u201d by \u201ceffectively] pre-empting] . . . state employment laws [that] restrict or limit the ability of employees and employers to enter into arbitration agreements.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 121-122 [121 S.Ct. at p. 1312].) Amici curiae contended \u201cthat States should be permitted, pursuant to their traditional role in regulating employment relationships, to prohibit employees . . . from contracting away their right to pursue state-law discrimination claims in court.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 122 [121 S.Ct. at p. 1312].) The high court responded that under <em>Gilmer, </em>arbitration agreements in employment contracts \u201ccan be enforced under the FAA without contravening the policies of <em>congressional </em>enactments giving employees specific protection against discrimination prohibited by federal law.\u201d <em>(Circuit City, supra, </em>532 U.S. at p. 123 [121 S.Ct. at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>p. 1313], italics added.) As for the policies of <em>state </em>laws, the court found them irrelevant under <em>Southland's </em>holding \u201cthat Congress intended the FAA ... to pre-empt state antiarbitration laws to the contrary. [Citation.]\u201d <em>0Circuit City, supra, </em>532 U.S. at p. 122 [121 S.Ct. at p. 1312]; see also <em>id. </em>at p. 112 <em>[Southland </em>held that the FAA is \u201cpre-emptive of state laws hostile to arbitration\u201d].) The court also declared that courts may \u201cnot chip away at <em>Southland </em>by indirection.\u201d <em>(Circuit City, supra, </em>532 U.S. at p. 122.) Thus, <em>Circuit City </em>holds that we may not, as <em>Broughton </em>did, chip away at <em>Southland </em>by applying <em>Gilmer\u2019s </em>exemption analysis, including the \u201cinherent conflict\u201d exception, based on the intent or policies of a <em>state </em>legislature. Under <em>Circuit City, </em>only \u201cthe policies of <em>congressional </em>enactments\u201d are relevant to this analysis; state policies are simply irrelevant unless, as the FAA provides, they establish grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract. <em>(Circuit City, supra, </em>532 U.S. at p. 123 [121 S.Ct. at p. 1313], italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b370-4\"><em>Circuit City </em>also undermines <em>Broughton\u2019s </em>analysis and conclusion in another important respect. As I have explained, amici curiae in <em>Circuit City </em>argued for a construction of the FAA that would leave states free to prohibit employees from contracting away their right to a judicial forum for resolving discrimination claims under state law. <em>(Circuit City, supra, </em>532 U.S. at pp. 121-122 [121 S.Ct. at p. 1312].) In rejecting this argument, the high court reasoned in part that amici curiae\u2019s construction would enable states to deprive parties of the \u201creal benefits to the enforcement of arbitration provisions.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 122-123 [121 S.Ct. at pp. 1312-1313].) \u201cArbitration,\u201d the court explained, \u201callow[s] parties to avoid the costs of litigation .... These litigation costs . . . would be compounded by the difficult choice-of-law questions that are often presented in disputes arising from the employment relationship [citation], and the necessity of bifurcation of proceedings in those cases where state law precludes arbitration of certain types of employment claims but not others.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 123 [121 S.Ct. at p. 1313].) The court also explained that amici curiae\u2019s construction would produce \u201cconsiderable complexity and uncertainty\u201d regarding \u201cthe enforceability of arbitration agreements in employment contracts,\u201d which \u201cwould call into doubt the efficacy of alternative dispute resolution procedures adopted by many of the Nation\u2019s employers, in the process undermining the FAA\u2019s proarbitration purposes and \u2018breeding litigation from a statute that seeks to avoid it.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>As both <em>Broughton </em>and the case now before us amply demonstrate, <em>Broughton\u2019s </em>holding produces precisely these effects; it deprives parties of the benefits of arbitration, necessitates bifurcated proceedings and compounds litigation costs, and creates both complexity and uncertainty regarding the enforceability of arbitration agreements, thereby placing in doubt arbitration\u2019s efficacy as an alternative dispute resolution <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>procedure, \u201cundermining the FAA\u2019s proarbitration purposes and \u2018breeding litigation from a statute that seeks to avoid it.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Circuit City, supra, </em>532 U.S. at p. 123 [121 S.Ct. at p. 1313].)</p>\n<p id=\"b371-5\">The majority here errs in asserting that because <em>Circuit City </em>\u201cwas principally concerned with\u201d the construction of section 1 of the FAA, whereas <em>Broughton </em>involved \u201cthe preemptive scope of section 2,\u201d <em>Circuit City </em>has \u201clittle if any bearing on\u201d <em>Broughton. </em>(Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 314.) First and foremost, as I have explained, <em>Circuit City </em>expressly relied on \u201cthe preemptive scope of section 2\u201d (maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 314) in rejecting the argument that the high court should construe the FAA so as to leave states free to implement their own \u201cpolicies\u201d regarding the nonarbitrability of discrimination claims under state law. <em>(Circuit City, supra, </em>532 U.S. at pp. 121-122 [121 S.Ct. at p. 1312].) Again, the high court found the argument foreclosed by <em>Southland's </em>holding\u2014reaffirmed in Allied-Bruce\u2014that section 2 of the FAA \u201cpre-empt[s] state antiarbitration laws.\u201d <em>(Circuit City, supra, </em>532 U.S. at p. 122 [121 S.Ct. at p. 1312].) Second, the high court based its construction of section 1 on the language and judicial construction of section 2. Regarding the former, the court contrasted the expansive language of section 2 with the narrower language of section 1. <em>(Circuit City, supra, </em>532 U.S. at pp. 115, 117-118 [121 S.Ct. at pp. 1309, 1310].) Regarding the latter, the court explained that the plaintiffs broad reading of section 1 was inconsistent with the court\u2019s \u201cexpansive reading of \u00a7 2.\u201d <em>(Circuit City, supra, </em>532 U.S. at p. 119 [121 S.Ct. at p. 1311].) The court reasoned that the plaintiffs construction of section 1 would deprive parties of the arbitration benefits that section 2 confers and, by creating \u201cconsiderable complexity and uncertainty\u201d regarding \u201cthe enforceability of arbitration agreements,\u201d would \u201cunderminfe]\u201d section 2\u2019s \u201cproarbitration purposes.\u201d <em>(Circuit City, supra, </em>532 U.S. at p. 123 [121 S.Ct. at p. 1313].) The court also explained that \u201cit would be incongruous to adopt\u201d a reading of section 1 that would \u201cundo\u201d the broad \u201ccoverage in \u00a7 2\u201d that \u201cimplement[s] proarbitration policies.\u201d <em>(Circuit City, supra, </em>532 U.S. at p. 122 [121 S.Ct. at p. 1313].) Third, the plaintiffs argument in <em>Circuit City </em>regarding section 1 was premised on the high court\u2019s \u201cconstruction of \u00a7 2\u2019s coverage provision.\u201d <em>{Circuit City, supra, </em>532 U.S. at p. 114 [121 S. Ct. at p. 1308.) Fourth, and finally, before even discussing the scope of section 1, the high court considered, and rejected, the plaintiffs argument regarding the \u201cconstruction of \u00a7 2,\u201d i.e., that section 2 of the FAA did not apply because \u201can employment contract is not a \u2018contract evidencing a transaction involving interstate commerce\u2019 \u201d within the meaning of section 2. <em>{Circuit City, supra, </em>532 U.S. at p. 113 [121 S.Ct. at p. 1308].) Thus, the majority errs in asserting that section 2 of the FAA\u2014and specifically its \u201cpreemptive scope\u201d (maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 314)\u2014 were not critical components of the high court\u2019s opinion in <em>Circuit City.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b372-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>The majority also errs in asserting that <em>Circuit City </em>does not \u201cshed any further light on the \u2018inherently incompatible\u2019 exception to arbitrability.\u201d (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 314.) In <em>Circuit City, </em>the attorneys general essentially argued that arbitration is inherently incompatible with state statutes that \u201cprohibit employees . . . from contracting away their right to pursue state-law discrimination claims in court,\u201d and that requiring arbitration of these claims would \u201cintrude[] upon the policies of the separate States\u201d reflected in these statutes. <em>(Circuit City, supra, </em>532 U.S. at pp. 121-122 [121 S.Ct. at p. 1312].) As I have explained, in rejecting this argument, the court held that whereas Gilmer\u2014which sets forth the inherent conflict analysis <em>Broughton </em>adopted\u2014\u201cinvolved a federal statute\u201d and thus governs enforcement of agreements to arbitrate claims <em>under federal law (Circuit City, supra, </em>532 U.S. at pp. 123-124 [121 S.Ct. at pp. 1313-1314]), enforcement of agreements to arbitrate claims <em>under state law </em>is both governed <em>and required </em>by <em>Southland's </em>holding that the FAA \u201cpre-empt[s] state antiarbitration laws.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 122 [121 S.Ct. at p. 1312].) Thus, <em>Circuit City </em>establishes that an exception to the FAA may not be based on a <em>state\u2019s </em>view that arbitration is inherently incompatible with some <em>state </em>policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-4\">In this regard, <em>Circuit City </em>is consistent with another high court decision that <em>Broughton </em>completely ignored: <em>Mastrobuono. </em>There, the high court held that the FAA preempts a New York rule prohibiting an arbitrator from awarding punitive damages even where an arbitration agreement authorizes the award. <em>(Mastrobuono, supra, </em>514 U.S. at pp. 53-58 [115 S.Ct. at pp. 1214-1217].) New York established this rule based on its view that punitive damages are exemplary social remedies intended to punish and deter, not to compensate, and that as a matter of strong public policy, only the state\u2014and not private arbitrators\u2014may wield the power to punish. <em>(Garrity </em>v. <em>Lyle Stuart, Inc. </em>(1976) 40 N.Y.2d 354 [386 N.Y.S.2d 831, 832-835, 353 N.E.2d 793, 794-797, 83 A.L.R.3d 1024] <em>(Garrity).) </em>According to the state\u2019s highest court, New York\u2019s public policy requires \u201c \u2018rather close judicial supervision\u2019 \u201d in the administration of this public penal sanction and, contrary to this public policy, \u201c \u2018there [is] no effective judicial supervision over punitive awards in arbitration.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 834 [353 N.E.2d at pp. 796-797].) In finding that the FAA preempts the New York rule, the high court explained that under its prior decisions, \u201cif contracting parties agree to <em>include </em>claims for punitive damages within the issues to be arbitrated, the FAA ensures that their agreement will be enforced according to its terms <em>even if a rule of state law would otherwise exclude such claims from arbitration.\u201d (Mastrobuono, supra, </em>514 U.S. at p. 58 [115 S.Ct. at p. 1216], italics added.) Therefore, \u201cin the absence of contractual intent to the contrary, the FAA would pre-empt the [New York] rule,\u201d despite its basis in the state\u2019s public policy. <em>(Mastrobuono, supra, </em>514 U.S. at p. 59 [115 S.Ct. at p. 1217].) According to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>high court, the question thus came \u201cdown to what the contract\u2019\u2014not New York law\u2014\u201cha[d] to say about the arbitrability of [the] claim for punitive damages.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>atp. 58 [115 S.Ct. atp. 1216], italics added.) The court found that \u201c[a]t most,\u201d one contractual provision \u201cintroduce[d] an ambiguity into an arbitration agreement that would otherwise allow punitive damages awards.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 62 [115 S.Ct. at p. 1218].) Explaining that the FAA requires resolution of such ambiguities in favor of arbitration, the court read the arbitration agreement to permit arbitration of a punitive damages claim and it ordered enforcement of the arbitrator\u2019s award of punitive damages notwithstanding New York\u2019s law precluding such an award. <em>(Mastrobuono, supra, </em>514 U.S. at pp. 62-64 [115 S.Ct. atp. pp. 1218-1219].)</p>\n<p id=\"b373-5\"><em>Mastrobuono, </em>which <em>Broughton </em>did not consider or even cite, undermines <em>Broughton\u2019s </em>analysis and conclusion in several critical respects. First, it directly contradicts <em>Broughton\u2019s </em>statement that the high court \u201cha[d] never directly decided whether a legislature may restrict a private arbitration agreement when it inherently conflicts with a public statutory purpose that transcends private interests.\u201d <em>(Broughton, supra, </em>21 Cal.4th at p. 1083.) Second, it directly refutes <em>Broughton\u2019s </em>view that arbitration of CLRA injunction requests is impermissible because of the need for continuing judicial supervision of CLRA injunctions. <em>(Broughton, supra, </em>21 Cal.4th at p. 1081.) Finally, and perhaps most importantly, <em>Mastrobuono </em>directly refutes the fundamental premise of <em>Broughton\u2019s </em>analysis: that the high court cases leave <em>states </em>free to prohibit arbitration of a <em>state </em>remedy if \u201cthe primary purpose and effect of\u2019 that remedy is to protect the public, \u201cnot to compensate for an individual wrong.\u201d <em>(Broughton, supra, </em>21 Cal.4th at p. 1077.) In the high court\u2019s view, \u201cby definition,\u201d the purpose of punitive damages is \u201cnot . . . to compensate the injured party, but rather to punish the tortfeasor\u201d <em>(Newport v. Fact Concerts, Inc. </em>(1981) 453 U.S. 247, 266 [101 S.Ct. 2748, 2759, 69 L.Ed.2d 616]) and to \u201c \u2018protect[] the public by [deterring] the defendant and others from doing such wrong in the future.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Pacific Mutual Life Insurance Co. v. Haslip </em>(1991) 499 U.S. 1, 19 [111 S.Ct. 1032, 1044, 113 L.Ed.2d 1].) Given the court\u2019s view that the purpose of punitive damages is to protect the public and <em>not </em>to compensate the victim in any sense, Mastrobuono\u2019s invalidation of New York\u2019s rule against arbitration of punitive damages clearly established that the FAA preempts state laws prohibiting arbitration of such public, noncompensatory remedies.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-6\">The majority errs in suggesting that <em>Broughton </em>can be reconciled with <em>Mastrobuono </em>because punitive damages are different from public injunctions in some relevant sense. (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at 312, fh. 1.) Consistent with the high court\u2019s view, we have explained that the \u201cpurpose\u201d of a punitive damages award \u201cis a purely <em>public </em>one\u201d\u2014\u201cto punish wrongdoing and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>thereby to protect [the public] from future misconduct, either by the same defendant or other potential wrongdoers. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Adams v. Murakami </em>(1991) 54 Cal.3d 105, 110 [284 Cal.Rptr. 318, 813 P.2d 1348], fn. omitted <em>(Adams).) </em>Thus, under existing California law, punitive damages have the same \u201cprimary purpose and effect\u201d that, according to <em>Broughton, </em>public injunctions have; \u201cnot to compensate for an individual wrong but to prohibit and enjoin conduct injurious to the general public.\u201d <em>(Broughton, supra, </em>21 Cal.4th at p. 1077.) As the preceding quote demonstrates, <em>Broughton </em>held that arbitrability depends not, as the majority suggests, on whether a remedy \u201cconferfs] a direct benefit on the plaintiff[]\u201d (maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 313, fn. 1), but on whether \u201cthe primary purpose and effect of\u2019 the remedy is \u201cto compensate for an individual wrong\u201d or \u201cto prohibit and enjoin conduct injurious to the general public.\u201d <em>(Broughton, supra, </em>21 Cal.4th at p. 1077.) Applying this test, <em>Broughton </em>held that CLRA requests for public injunctions are inarbitrable because such relief is \u201cdesigned for the protection of the general public.\u201d <em>(Broughton, supra, </em>21 Cal.4th at p. 1083.) <em>Broughton's </em>analysis and conclusion are clearly irreconcilable with <em>Mastrobuono, </em>which held that requests for punitive damages are arbitrable <em>even though </em>their <em>sole </em>purpose is to protect the public and <em>not </em>to compensate the victim in any sense. Thus, that this case involves a request for injunctive relief rather than punitive damages is not a valid basis for distinguishing <em>Mastrobuono. </em>Indeed, as I later explain in more detail, the high court rejected this very distinction in its post <em>-Broughton </em>decision in <em>Waffle House.</em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b374-4\">The majority\u2019s attempt to distinguish <em>Mastrobuono </em>fails for an additional reason. The majority suggests that regarding \u201c \u2018judicial supervision\u2019 \u201d in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>arbitration, the New York rule at issue in <em>Mastrobuono </em>was premised on the inadequacy of \u201cjudicial and appellate review,\u201d whereas <em>Broughton </em>was premised on the \u201cmonitoring, enforcement, and modification that is required of public injunctions.\u201d (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 313, fix. 1.) However, <em>Broughton\u2019s </em>discussion of this subject stressed the fact that \u201c[arbitrators\u201d are \u201cunconstrained by judicial review\u201d and \u201care not necessarily bound by earlier decisions of other arbitrators in the same case.\u201d <em>(Broughton, supra, </em>21 Cal.4th at p. 1081.) Thus, for several reasons, the majority\u2019s attempt to distinguish <em>Mastrobuono </em>is unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-5\">In <em>Circuit City </em>and <em>Mastrobuono, </em>the high court simply applied the general constitutional rule regarding the supremacy of federal law specifically in the arbitration context. The supremacy clause of the United States Constitution (U.S. Const., art. VI, cl. 2) \u201cinvalidates <em>all </em>state laws that conflict or interfere with an Act of Congress. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Rose v. Arkansas State Police </em>(1986) 479 U.S. 1, 3 [107 S.Ct. 334, 335, 93 L.Ed.2d 183], italics added.) According to the high court, this rule applies regardless of the magnitude or nature of the public policy the state law seeks to implement. \u201cThe relative importance to the State of its own law is not material when there is a conflict with a valid federal law, for the Framers of our [federal] Constitution provided [in the supremacy clause] that the federal law must prevail. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Free v. Bland </em>(1962) 369 U.S. 663, 666 [82 S.Ct. 1089, 1092, 8 L.Ed.2d 180].) Thus, the proper \u201cinquiry\u201d is \u201cwhether there is a conflict\u201d between the state law and federal law, not the significance of the state public policy at issue. (Ibid.; see also <em>Fidelity Federal Sav. &amp; Loan Assn. v. De La Cuesta </em>(1982) 458 U.S. 141, 153 [102 S.Ct. 3014, 3022, 73 L.Ed.2d 664] [federal preemption under the supremacy clause applies even though \u201creal property law is a matter of special concern to the States\u201d].) <em>Broughton\u2019s </em>reliance on the importance of the public interest at stake when a plaintiff seeks a CLRA injunction is inconsistent with these binding high court precedents and pronouncements. Regardless of the state\u2019s interest, a \u201cstate statute [that] authorizes the precise conduct that Congress sought to prohibit ... is repugnant to the [supremacy [c]lause.\u201d <em>(Rose </em>v. <em>Arkansas State Police, supra, </em>479 U.S. at p. 4 [107 S.Ct. at p. 335].) Thus, under <em>Broughton, </em>the CLRA is repugnant to the supremacy clause\u2014and is therefore invalid\u2014insofar as it authorizes California courts to do precisely what the FAA prohibits: invalidate FAA-govemed agreements to arbitrate requests for CLRA injunctions on grounds other than those that exist at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract. In short, <em>Mastrobuono </em>and the high court\u2019s post <em>-Broughton </em>decision in <em>Circuit City, </em>consistent with and following the high court\u2019s supremacy clause jurisprudence, refute a foundational assumption of <em>Broughton\u2019s </em>analysis: that states may create FAA exceptions for public policy reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>Indeed, <em>Mastrobuono </em>takes on increased importance with respect to this issue in light of the high court\u2019s second relevant post <em>-Broughton </em>decision in <em>Waffle </em>House, which held that under the FAA, there is no difference in terms of arbitrability between requests for public injunctive relief and requests for compensatory or punitive damages. In <em>Waffle House, </em>the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) filed a discrimination action under the Americans With Disabilities Act \u201cboth in the public interest and on behalf of\u2019 the specific victim of the discrimination, who had signed an arbitration agreement with the defendant. <em>(Waffle House, supra, </em>534 U.S. at p. 284 [122 S.Ct. at p. 759].) The complaint requested \u201cinjunctive relief to \u2018eradicate the effects of [the defendant\u2019s] past and present unlawful employment practices\u2019 \u201d and \u201cspecific relief designed to make [the victim] whole, including backpay, . . . compensatory damages, and . . . punitive damages . . . .\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 283-284 [122 S.Ct. at p. 759].) The court of appeals held that the victim\u2019s arbitration agreement \u201cprecluded [the EEOC] from seeking victim-specific relief in court,\u201d but not from seeking \u201c \u2018large-scale injunctive relief.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 284 [122 S.Ct. at p. 759].) In so \u201cdistinguishing] between injunctive and victim-specific relief,\u201d the court of appeals concluded that \u201cthe EEOC is barred from obtaining the latter because any public interest served when the EEOC pursues \u2018make whole\u2019 relief is outweighed by the policy goals favoring arbitration.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 290 [122 S.Ct. at p. 762].) However, the court of appeals reasoned, \u201cwhen the EEOC seeks broad injunctive relief, ... the public interest overcome [s] the goals underpinning the FAA.\u201d <em>(Ibid., </em>fn. omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b376-4\">The high court in <em>Waffle House </em>held that under the FAA, a distinction in terms of arbitrability between requests for broad, large-scale injunctive relief to protect the public and requests for monetary relief, including punitive damages, is invalid. <em>(Waffle House, supra, </em>534 U.S. at pp. 294-296 [122 S.Ct. at pp. 764-765].) The court explained that this distinction does not serve \u201cits avowed purpose of preserving the EEOC\u2019s public function while favoring arbitration. For that purpose, the category of victim-specific relief is both overinclusive and underinclusive. For example, it is overinclusive because . . . punitive damages . . . serve an obvious public function in deterring future violations. [Citations.] Punitive damages may often have a greater impact on the behavior of other employers than the threat of an injunction, yet the EEOC is precluded from seeking this form of relief under the Court of Appeals\u2019 compromise scheme. And, it is underinclusive because injunctive relief, although seemingly not \u2018victim-specific,\u2019 can be seen as more closely tied to the employees\u2019 injury than to any public interest.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 294-295 [122 S.Ct. at pp. 764-765].) \u201c \u2018While injunctive relief may appear more \u201cbroad based,\u201d it nonetheless is redress for individuals.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 295 [122 S.Ct. at p. 765].) Thus, the court held, \u201cif the [FAA\u2019s] policy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>favoring arbitration trumps the plain language of Title VII and the contract, the EEOC should be barred from pursuing any claim outside the arbitral forum. If not, then the statutory language is clear; the EEOC has the authority to pursue victim-specific relief regardless of the forum that the employer and employee have chosen to resolve their disputes.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>The high court ultimately held that because the EEOC was not a party to the arbitration agreement, it could pursue an action in court for both injunctive relief and victim-specific, monetary relief. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 296 [122 S.Ct. p. 765].)</p>\n<p id=\"b377-5\">The high court\u2019s <em>post-Broughton </em>decision in <em>Waffle House </em>requires that we overrule <em>Broughton </em>as being inconsistent with binding high court precedent. As I have explained, <em>Broughton </em>held that CERA requests for injunctive relief are not arbitrable because the \u201cpurpose\u201d of such relief is \u201cto remedy a public wrong\u201d and to protect \u201cthe general public,\u201d not to \u201ccompensat[e]\u201d the plaintiff who pursues the CERA claim. <em>(Broughton, supra, </em>21 Cal.4th at p. 1080.) In <em>Waffle House, </em>the high court rejected this analysis, explaining that even large-scale requests for public \u201cinjunctive relief . . . can be seen as more closely tied to the [victim\u2019s] injury than to any public interest\u201d and \u201c \u2018is redress for individuals.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Waffle House, supra, </em>534 U.S. at p. 295 [122 S.Ct. at p. 765].) The high court also explained that in terms of public protection, \u201c[p]unitive damages may often have a greater impact on\u201d a defendant\u2019s \u201cbehavior . . . than the threat of an injunction . . . .\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>This statement, in light of <em>Mastrobuono's </em>holding that the FAA requires enforcement of agreements to arbitrate requests for punitive damages <em>notwithstanding a state law precluding such arbitration (Mastrobuono, supra, </em>514 U.S. at pp. 53-58 [115 S.Ct. at pp. 1214-1217]), contradicts <em>Broughton's </em>conclusion that we may base an FAA exception for CERA injunctive relief on the public nature of such relief. As I have also explained, <em>Broughton </em>held that although the FAA requires enforcement of agreements to arbitrate requests for monetary relief, it does not require enforcement of agreements to arbitrate requests for injunctive relief designed to protect the public. The high court in <em>Waffle House </em>rejected this approach as well, holding that the precise distinction <em>Broughton </em>drew\u2014between large-scale requests for injunctive relief to protect the public and requests for victim-specific, monetary relief\u2014is invalid under the FAA, and that as a matter of federal law, the FAA requires courts to enforce an agreement to arbitrate requests for injunctive relief, even if that relief is designed principally to protect the public. <em>(Waffle House, supra, </em>534 U.S. at pp. 294-296 [122 S.Ct. at pp. 764-765].) Thus, <em>Waffle House </em>requires that we overrule <em>Broughton </em>and hold that federal law requires enforcement of agreements to arbitrate CERA requests for injunctive relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-6\">The majority\u2019s discussion of <em>Waffle House </em>completely misses the point of that decision. In <em>Waffle House, </em>the high court did not, as the majority <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>suggests, base its decision on the extent to which the EEOC \u201cact[s] ... on behalf of the public.\u201d (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 320, in. 6.) In fact, the high court found that the lower federal court had erred in focusing on precisely this factor. <em>(Waffle House, supra, </em>534 U.S. at pp. 290-296 [122 S.Ct. at pp. 762-765].) Instead, the high court held that because the FAA \u201c \u2018does not require parties to arbitrate when they have not agreed to do so,\u2019 \u201d the determinative issue is simply whether the EEOC \u201cis a party to the contract\u201d containing the arbitration provision. <em>(Waffle House, supra, </em>534 U.S. at pp. 293-294 [122 S.Ct. at p. 764].) If not, then the EEOC has statutory authority to seek in court both large-scale injunctive relief to protect the public and damages. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 294 [122 S.Ct. at p. 764].) However, if the EEOC has agreed to arbitration, then it must arbitrate <em>all </em>of its claims\u2014including any request for large-scale, public injunctive relief\u2014and is \u201cbarred from pursuing <em>any </em>claim outside the arbitral forum.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 295 [122 S.Ct. at p. 765], italics added.) In the latter situation, in terms of arbitrability, no \u201cline [may be] drawn . . . between injunctive and victim-specific relief.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 294 [122 S.Ct. at p. 764].) Thus, <em>Waffle House </em>establishes that contrary to <em>Broughton, </em>consumers, like Cruz, who have agreed to arbitration must arbitrate <em>all </em>of their claims, including requests for so-called public injunctions.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-4\">While the high court\u2019s post <em>-Broughton </em>decisions in <em>Circuit City </em>and <em>Waffle House </em>undermine one of <em>Broughton\u2019s </em>fundamental premises\u2014that states may decide that injunctive relief is somehow different from monetary damages for purposes of applying the FAA\u2014the high court\u2019s third relevant post <em>-Broughton </em>decision in <em>Green Tree </em>undermines <em>Broughton\u2019s </em>other fundamental premise: its <em>assumption </em>that \u201cprivate arbitration\u201d has several \u201cinstitutional shortcomings\u201d that render it inherently unsuitable for resolving requests for \u201cpublic injunctions.\u201d <em>(Broughton, supra, </em>21 Cal.4th at p. 1081.) In <em>Green Tree, </em>the plaintiff argued that the arbitration agreement she signed left her \u201cunable to vindicate her statutory rights in arbitration\u201d\u2014and was therefore unenforceable\u2014because its \u201csilence with respect to [payment of] costs and fees create[d] a \u2018risk\u2019 that she [would] be required to bear prohibitive arbitration costs if she pursue[d] her claims in an arbitral forum.\u201d <em>(Green Tree, supra, </em>531 U.S. at p. 90 [121 S.Ct. at p.-522].). The high court disagreed, finding that the agreement\u2019s mere \u201csilence on the subject\u201d of fees was \u201calone . . . insufficient to render it unenforceable.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 91 [121 S.Ct. at p. 522].) Instead, the court held, \u201ca party seeking] to invalidate an arbitration agreement on the ground that arbitration would be prohibitively expensive . . . bears the burden of showing the likelihood of incurring such costs.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 92 [121 S.Ct. at p. 522].) In reaching this conclusion, the court acknowledged that \u201cthe existence of large arbitration costs could preclude a litigant . . . from effectively vindicating her federal statutory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>rights in the arbitral forum.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 90 [121 S.Ct. at p. 522].) However, the court held, absent evidence <em>in \u201c[t]he record\u2019 </em>on this question, \u201c[t]he \u2018risk\u2019 that [a plaintiff] will be saddled with prohibitive costs is too speculative to justify the invalidation of an arbitration agreement.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 91 [121 S.Ct. at p. 522].) \u201cTo invalidate the agreement on that [speculative] basis,\u201d the court explained, \u201cwould undermine the \u2018liberal federal policy favoring arbitration agreements,\u2019 [citation]\u201d and would \u201cconflict with\u201d the court\u2019s \u201cprior holdings that the party resisting arbitration bears the burden of proving that the claims at issue are unsuitable for arbitration.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>Thus, the court held, courts may not justify invalidating arbitration agreements with \u201cgeneralized attacks on arbitration that rest,\u201d not on evidence in the record, but \u201con \u2018suspicion of arbitration as a method of weakening the protections afforded in the substantive law to would-be complainants.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 89-90 [121 S.Ct. at p. 521].)</p>\n<p id=\"b379-5\"><em>Broughton\u2019s </em>analysis is fundamentally inconsistent with the high court\u2019s subsequent decision in <em>Green Tree. </em>As I have explained, in invalidating agreements to arbitrate CLRA requests for injunctive relief, <em>Broughton </em>asserted that several \u201cinstitutional shortcomings\u201d of arbitration render it inherently unsuitable for resolving requests for \u201cpublic injunctions.\u201d <em>(Broughton, supra, </em>21 Cal.4th at p. 1081.) However, <em>Broughton </em>cited no evidence\u2014in the record or otherwise\u2014or judicially noticeable facts to establish, or even support, this assertion. Nor does the majority here cite any such evidence. Nor did the plaintiff in <em>Broughton </em>or Cruz in this case offer any evidence on this question; under <em>Green Tree, </em>it was their burden, as the parties seeking to invalidate the arbitration agreements, to offer such evidence. Thus, \u201c[t]he \u2018risk\u2019 \u201d that arbitration\u2019s so-called institutional shortcomings render it less effective than court proceedings for dealing with public injunctions is completely \u201cspeculative\u201d and insufficient \u201cto justify the invalidation of an arbitration agreement\u201d requiring arbitration of CLRA requests for injunctive relief. <em>(Green Tree, supra, </em>531 U.S. at p. 91 [121 S.Ct. at p. 522].) Indeed, the very existence of those shortcomings is completely speculative. In short, <em>Broughton\u2019s </em>holding regarding arbitration of CLRA injunction requests rests on the very \u201cgeneralized\u201d and <em>unproven </em>\u201c \u2018suspicion of arbitration\u2019 \u201d that <em>Green Tree </em>holds <em>may not </em>be a basis for invalidating an arbitration agreement. <em>(Green Tree, supra, </em>531 U.S. at p. 89 [121 S.Ct. at p. 521].) As the high court stated in <em>Green Tree, </em>\u201c[t]o invalidate [arbitration] agreements] on [such a speculative] basis . . . undermine[s] the \u2018liberal federal policy favoring arbitration agreements.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Green Tree, supra, </em>531 U.S. at p. 91 [121 S.Ct. at p. p. 522].) Thus, <em>Green Tree </em>and the high court\u2019s other relevant <em>post-Broughton </em>decisions require that we overrule <em>Broughton </em>insofar as it invalidates agreements to arbitrate CLRA injunction requests, and that we hold that <em>all </em>of Cruz\u2019s claims are arbitrable.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>IV. Extending <em>Broughton </em>to UCL Claims Eviscerates the Strong Public Policy Favoring Enforcement of Arbitration Agreements.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-4\">As <em>Broughton </em>recognized, the FAA is a \u201cfederal statutory mandate\u201d that establishes a \u201cstrong public policy in favor of enforcing arbitration agreements.\u201d (Bro<em>ughton, supra, </em>21 Cal.4th at p. 1073.) \u201cSection 2 [of the FAA] is a congressional declaration of a liberal federal policy favoring arbitration agreements . . . <em>(Moses H. Cone Hospital v. Mercury Constr. Corp. </em>(1983) 460 U.S. 1, 24 [103 S.Ct. 927, 941, 74 L.Ed.2d 765].) It \u201ccreate[s] a body of federal substantive law of arbitrability, applicable to any arbitration agreement within the coverage of the [FAA].\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>\u201c[(Questions of arbitrability must be addressed with a healthy regard for [this] federal policy favoring arbitration. . . . The [FAA] establishes that, as a matter of federal law, any doubts concerning the scope of arbitrable issues should be resolved in favor of arbitration,\u201d whatever the question at hand. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 24-25 [103 S.Ct. at pp. 941-942].)</p>\n<p id=\"b380-5\">As <em>Broughton </em>also recognized, \u201cCalifornia has a similar statute [citation] and a similar policy in favor of arbitration. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Broughton, supra, </em>21 Cal.4th at p. 1074.) Code of Civil Procedure section 1281 provides that written arbitration agreements are \u201cvalid, enforceable and irrevocable, save upon such grounds as exist for the revocation of any contract.\u201d This section establishes the \u201cfundamental policy\u201d of California\u2019s arbitration scheme: \u201cthat arbitration agreements will be enforced <em>in accordance with their terms.\u201d (Vandenberg </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1999) 21 Cal.4th 815, 836, in. 10 [88 Cal.Rptr.2d 366, 982 P.2d 229].) Through the statute\u2019s enactment, \u201cthe Legislature . . . expressed a \u2018strong public policy in favor of arbitration as a speedy and relatively inexpensive means of dispute resolution.\u2019 [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Moncharsh </em>v. <em>Heily &amp; Blase </em>(1992) 3 Cal.4th 1, 9 [10 Cal.Rptr.2d 183, 832 P.2d 899].) As we explained more than 85 years ago, \u201c[t]he policy of the law in recognizing arbitration agreements and in providing by statute for their enforcement is to encourage persons who wish to avoid delays incident to a civil action to obtain an adjustment of their differences by a tribunal of their own choosing.\u201d <em>(Utah Const. Co. v. Western Pac. Ry. Co. </em>(1916) 174 Cal. 156, 159 [162 P. 631].) Thus, California law, like federal law, establishes \u201ca presumption in favor of arbitrability.\u201d <em>(Engalla v. Permanente Medical Group, Inc. </em>(1997) 15 Cal.4th 951, 971 [64 Cal.Rptr.2d 843, 938 P.2d 903].)</p>\n<p id=\"b380-6\">In extending <em>Broughton </em>to hold that UCL claims for injunctive relief are not arbitrable, the majority guts the strong federal and state public policy favoring enforcement of arbitration agreements. As we have explained, the UCL\u2019s \u201cscope is broad\u201d and \u201c[i]ts coverage is \u2018sweeping, embracing \u201c \u2018anything that can properly be called a business practice and that at the same time <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>is forbidden by law.\u2019 \u201d \u2019 [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Cel-Tech Communications, Inc. </em>v. <em>Los Angeles Cellular Telephone Co. </em>(1999) 20 Cal.4th 163, 180 [83 Cal.Rptr.2d 548, 973 P.2d 527].) In proscribing \u201cany unlawful . . . business act or practice,\u201d Business and Professions Code section 17200 \u201c \u2018 \u201cborrows\u201d violations of other laws and treats these violations, <em>when committed pursuant to a business activity, </em>as unlawful practices independently actionable under [the UCL] and subject to the distinct remedies provided thereunder. \u2019 \u201d <em>(Farmers Ins. Exchange </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1992) 2 Cal.4th 377, 383 [6 Cal.Rptr.2d 487, 826 P.2d 730], italics added.) In other words, \u201c[a]n unlawful act <em>in the business context </em>is, by definition, an action of unfair competition\u201d that may support a UCL action. <em>(Stop Youth Addiction, Inc. v. Lucky Stores, Inc. </em>(1998) 17 Cal.4th 553, 579 [71 Cal.Rptr.2d 731, 950 P.2d 1086] (cone. opn. of Baxter, L), italics added.) Of course, because arbitration clauses are contractual, <em>every </em>arbitrable dispute will, by definition, involve business activity and acts in the business context. Thus, under the majority\u2019s holding, in <em>every </em>case where the parties have signed an arbitration agreement, the plaintiff can frustrate the defendant\u2019s contractual right to the benefits of an arbitral, rather than a judicial, forum\u2014which both the high court and this court have recognized\u2014simply by alleging a claim under the UCL and requesting injunctive relief. Thus, the majority\u2019s statutory construction guts the strong public policy favoring enforcement of arbitration agreements that both the California Legislature and the United States Congress have established by statute. It also does precisely what the high court has held states may not do: \u201cwholly eviscerate congressional intent [in passing the FAA] to place arbitration agreements \u2018upon the same footing as other contracts,\u2019 [citation], simply by passing statutes\u201d that make certain arbitration agreements void as a matter of state public policy. <em>(Southland, supra, </em>465 U.S. at p. 17, fn. 11 [104 S.Ct. at p. 861].)</p>\n<p id=\"b381-5\">More specifically, because a UCL action may be based on a violation of other laws, the majority\u2019s holding will enable plaintiffs\u2014through artful pleading\u2014to obtain judicial determination of claims that they agreed to arbitrate and that the United States Supreme Court has expressly held to be arbitrable. In <em>Southland, </em>the high court held that where the FAA applies, claims under the California Franchise Investment Law are arbitrable notwithstanding a California statute prohibiting arbitration of such claims. <em>(Southland, supra, </em>465 U.S. atp. 16 [104 S.Ct. atpp. 860-861].) Similarly, in <em>Perry, </em>the high court held that where the FAA applies, claims under California law for unpaid wages are arbitrable notwithstanding a California statute prohibiting arbitration of such claims. <em>(Perry, supra, </em>482 U.S. at pp. 489-491 [107 S.Ct. at pp. 2525-2526].) Of course, a plaintiff may easily plead a violation of either our Franchise Investment Law or our wage payment statutes as a violation of the UCL. Under the majority\u2019s conclusion, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>by doing so, a plaintiff can frustrate the defendant\u2019s contractual right to an arbitral, rather than judicial, forum for claims under the Franchise Investment Law and our wage payment statutes, despite the high court\u2019s binding and express holdings in <em>Southland </em>and <em>Perry </em>that the FAA requires enforcement of agreements to arbitrate these claims.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Indeed, the majority\u2019s.conclusion vitiates numerous other high court holdings in precisely the same manner. The high court has held that the FAA requires enforcement of agreements to arbitrate claims under the federal Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967, the Sherman Act, the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, and the Securities Act of 1933. <em>(Gilmer, supra, </em>500 U.S. at pp. 27-28 [111 S.Ct. at pp. 1652-1653].) However, contrary to these binding holdings, because a violation of any of these federal statutes is also a violation of the UCL, the majority\u2019s conclusion enables a plaintiff to frustrate the defendant\u2019s contractual <em>right to </em>the benefits of an arbitral, rather than judicial, forum for these arbitrable federal claims simply by alleging them as violations of the UCL and requesting injunctive relief.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b382-4\">Finally, given the extremely broad standing provisions applicable to claims under the UCL and Business and Professions Code section 17500, the majority vitiates these binding high court precedents and sacrifices the strong public policy, favoring enforcement of arbitration agreements without justification. As the majority acknowledges (maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 315), Business and Professions Code section 17204 provides in part that UCL <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>actions for injunctive relief \u201cshall be prosecuted\u201d by the Attorney General of California, \u201cany district attorney,\u201d specified \u201ccounty counsel,\u201d \u201ccity prosecutor [s]\u201d and \u201ccity attorney [s],\u201d \u201cor . . . <em>any person acting for the interests of . . . the general </em>public.\u201d (Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7 17204, italics added.) Under our prior construction of this provision, \u201cmembers of the public\u201d other than a specific victim \u201calso have standing to pursue unfair competition claims,\u201d so \u201cthe policy underlying the unfair competition statute can be vindicated [in court] by multiple parties\u201d even if the specific victim has signed an arbitration agreement and is required to honor that agreement. <em>(Rubin v. Green </em>(1993) 4 Cal.4th 1187, 1204 [17 Cal.Rptr.2d 828, 847 P.2d 1044].) A similar standing provision applies to actions for injunctive relief under Business and Professions Code section 17500. (Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7 17535.) Given these broad standing provisions, and given that a violation of the CLRA also constitutes a violation of the UCL, we need not eviscerate the public policy strongly favoring enforcement of arbitration agreements in order to protect the public or to vindicate the public interest in enforcement of these statutes. Here, we need not let Cruz out of his arbitration agreement so he can proceed in court as a private attorney general, when the Attorney General himself, and any member of the general public who has not signed an arbitration agreement, can play that role. Accordingly, I dissent from the majority\u2019s conclusion that Cruz\u2019s requests for injunctive relief are not arbitrable.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-5\">Baxter, J., and Brown, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b365-8\"><em> Mastrobuono v.
