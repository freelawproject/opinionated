(Pen. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 187, 190.2, subd. (a)(3).) This appeal is automatic. (Pen. Code, \u00a7 1239, subd. (b).) For the reasons stated below, the judgment is affirmed.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b968-10\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b968-11\">Guilt Phase</p>\n<p id=\"b968-12\">A. <em>Overview</em></p>\n<p id=\"b968-13\">Nona Chapman ran a foster home for teenage girls on Weswin Court in Placerville. Darlene S. (Darlene), age 17, moved into the home on December <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"927\">*927</page-number>14, 1983. Debbie Galston (Debbie), age 14, moved in on May 11, 1984, left two weeks later, and returned on July 10, 1984. Her sister, Denise Galston (Denise), also age 14 (they were two of a set of triplets), moved in on May 23, 1984. Joanna N. (Joanna), age 17, moved in on May 25, 1984.</p>\n<p id=\"b969-5\">Joanna testified that she saw defendant stab Denise to death on June 12, 1984. Denise\u2019s body was found in the El Dorado National Forest on July 31, 1984. Her clothes were found on April 30, 1985, near the location where her body had been found.</p>\n<p id=\"b969-6\">Lynda Burrill (Lynda), age 18, lived with roommates in Placerville and was acquainted with the girls who lived in the foster home. She disappeared on June 29, 1984, and was last seen with defendant. Her body was found in the El Dorado National Forest on August 4, 1984. A week later, her clothes were recovered near the location where the body was found.</p>\n<p id=\"b969-7\">Debbie disappeared from the foster home on August 8, 1984. Joanna, who was Debbie\u2019s roommate at the home, found her clothes in the El Dorado National Forest on August 10, 1984. Debbie\u2019s body was found on October 27, 1984, not far from where her clothes were found.</p>\n<p id=\"b969-8\">Defendant, then age 27, worked at a convalescent hospital in Placerville. Although employed, he often slept in his car, which he would park in downtown Placerville. He met Darlene in January 1984 and immediately began dating her. They would often go camping in the areas where the victims\u2019 bodies were later recovered. They married in September 1984, but defendant left Darlene in November of that year. Defendant knew all of the murdered girls, as he frequented an arcade called The Oz in downtown Placerville where they congregated, and he often picked up Darlene at the foster home. Testimony showed he had a low regard for the three victims.</p>\n<p id=\"b969-9\">Darlene testified that defendant told her shortly after Debbie disappeared that he had killed all three girls. Defendant was arrested on November 10, 1984 for the three murders.</p>\n<p id=\"b969-10\">B. <em>Defendant\u2019s Attitude Toward the Victims</em></p>\n<p id=\"b969-11\">Several teenage girls testified that prior to Denise\u2019s murder on June 12, 1984, defendant had made rude and threatening comments toward the three victims. For example, Michele D. (Michele), age 15, testified that she met defendant in April of 1984 and that defendant called Denise a slut, stated that Debbie was \u201cturning out real bad,\u201d and called Lynda a \u201choser.\u201d Michele further stated that defendant\u2019s whole attitude changed in the spring and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"928\">*928</page-number>summer of 1984. \u201cHe became obscene and started listing people, labeling them, what they were and stuff.\u201d Defendant told Michele that she \u201cshouldn\u2019t be like them.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b970-5\">Lynette H., age 16, testified that in early April of 1984 she was riding in defendant\u2019s car when he told her \u201cthat some of the girls downtown had a bad reputation to him,\u201d and that they were \u201csluts.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b970-6\">Lynne A., a high school student, testified that she knew Debbie, Denise, and Lynda from downtown Placerville. In May of 1984, she was with the three victims and two other girls near The Oz when defendant came by, called the girls \u201csluts,\u201d and made a vulgar sexual reference toward them. On another occasion, Lynne A. testified that Lynda and two other girls were seated on a bench and defendant yelled from his car, \u201cDoes your mama know where you sluts are at?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b970-7\">Darlene testified that defendant called Denise a slut. She stated that in the spring of 1984, she and defendant were in his car and they saw Denise smoking a cigarette outside the foster home. Defendant told Darlene \u201cthree would be eliminated from the foster home and three more.\u201d On cross-examination, however, Darlene stated that \u201celiminate\u201d was her word.</p>\n<p id=\"b970-8\">C. <em>Murder of Denise Galston</em></p>\n<p id=\"b970-9\">Denise was last seen on June 12, 1984, the day she was murdered. Joanna witnessed her murder, but did not come forward with this information until late October of 1984.</p>\n<p id=\"b970-10\">On July 31, 1984, Denise\u2019s remains were found. Loggers John Keyser and Todd Story were working off Ferrari Mill Road. They testified that they reached that spot by driving down Iron Mountain Road, also known as Mormon Emigrant Trail, crossing two dams and making a right turn onto Ferrari Mill Road. On Ferrari Mill Road, they traveled approximately three-quarters of a mile to an intersection known as \u201cFour Comers,\u201d turned right and traveled about one-half to three-quarters of a mile. There they found a human skull and other bones. They found no clothing. Through dental records, including X-rays, it was determined that the bones were the remains of Denise. The pathologist was unable to determine the cause of death; all she could state was that there was no observable trauma to any of the bones.</p>\n<p id=\"b970-11\">On the evening of June 12, Joanna went to a church parking lot and began drinking. Thereafter, she went to downtown Placerville. She witnessed a commotion, during which Ron Burelco threw a cement block through the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"929\">*929</page-number>windshield of a patrol car. This incident took place between 9:10 and 9:30 p.m. At this time, she saw defendant by the Bell Tower (a local downtown landmark) in his car. He told Joanna that he wanted to talk to her. She got in his car and they drove to the city park. Defendant made a sexual overture to Joanna and grabbed her breast. Joanna returned downtown, where she saw Denise arguing with police officers. She pulled Denise aside and spoke with her. She then walked over to the Stancil\u2019s Toyota dealership, where she again saw Denise, and the two spoke briefly. Denise left, and Joanna watched her walk under an overpass, toward the foster home.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b971-5\">Joanna then saw defendant drive by and she made a rude gesture using her third finger, in response to the earlier incident in his car. Defendant stopped where Denise was walking. Joanna stated that it looked like they were arguing and Denise got into his car. The car turned around, approached Joanna, and stopped. Denise asked Joanna to get in the car. Joanna agreed, and sat in the front seat next to Denise. The three left Placerville and headed onto Highway 50. Defendant said they were going to a party. They got off at the Sly Park exit and drove onto Sly Park Road, and then onto Mormon Emigrant Trail. Soon thereafter, the car then turned onto a dirt road, which was Ferrari Mill Road. Joanna saw yellow letters on a tree stump and asked to stop to go to the bathroom. The car eventually stopped and Joanna got out, walked about 100 yards away from the car and vomited. She climbed up a wooded area and washed her face in a \u201clittle trickle of water, a stream,\u201d which was \u201cjust barely enough to wash [her] face.\u201d She could see by moonlight. She then heard Denise screaming her (Joanna\u2019s) name, and went to the area where she heard Denise\u2019s voice. She saw Denise running in the nude with defendant chasing her. It looked like Denise\u2019s hands were tied behind her back. Defendant pushed Denise down, put a knife to her throat, and stabbed her. Joanna stated she ran away while Denise was still screaming.</p>\n<p id=\"b971-6\">Joanna reached the road from which they had turned off to get onto Ferrari Mill Road (Mormon Emigrant Trail), saw a car coming, and hid. A second car drove toward her, and when she realized that it was not defendant\u2019s, she ran out in front of the car. The driver turned out to be a person named Joe whom she previously had met at a place called Happy Trails. She got in his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"930\">*930</page-number>car, told him nothing, and he dropped her off at the Burger King in Placerville.</p>\n<p id=\"b972-5\">Once in town, Joanna said she met Bruce Nesthus and stayed over at his house. Nesthus confirmed that he saw Joanna by the Bell Tower at approximately 3:30 a.m. Nesthus stated that Joanna was very jumpy and her mind seemed elsewhere; she would look over her shoulder and, when a car came by, she would try to hide; and, when she walked into his house, she sighed with relief. Nesthus stated that they had sexual relations and Joanna left the next morning, telling him she was going water-skiing.</p>\n<p id=\"b972-6\">Adele Nelson, Joanna\u2019s social worker, met with Joanna on June 13, 1984. She had spoken with her on seven to 10 occasions prior to that date. She said Joanna\u2019s demeanor was substantially different on June 13. Nelson stated that it seemed that what they had discussed two days earlier \u201cwas completely out of her mind, and [Nelson] wondered what had happened to obliterate what had been important to her from her mind.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b972-7\">Joanna testified that she told no one of the murder, including the police, Nesthus, Chapman, her boyfriend Larry Wright, or Darlene because she thought she would get in trouble and be arrested for the murder. She added that she was ashamed that she had not helped Denise. Thereafter, she avoided defendant and the foster home, and often stayed with her boyfriend\u2019s grandparents. She left Placerville the last week of August 1984 and moved to Renton, Washington, to live with her brother.</p>\n<p id=\"b972-8\">Joanna \u201ccouldn\u2019t live with herself\u2019 and returned to Placerville by train on October 29, 1994 because \u201cshe had to come back and tell somebody.\u201d The evening of her return, Joanna talked to Placerville Police Officer Phillip Dannaker. She was visibly shaking and crying at times. She said she knew something about the murders but was afraid the police might think she was involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b972-9\">The next day, October 30, 1984, Joanna chanced upon Fay Hamage, the wife of El Dorado County Sheriffs Detective Erol Hamage. Fay Hamage testified that she and Joanna began talking after her dog barked at Joanna. It was the first time she had ever met Joanna. Joanna, she said, started talking about the murders and was on the verge of becoming hysterical. Fay Hamage informed her that she was a sheriffs wife and suggested that Joanna accompany her home and meet with her husband, Detective Hamage. Joanna agreed. Once at the residence, Joanna met Detective Hamage and agreed to speak with him and El Dorado County Sheriff Sergeant Bill Wilson about the murders.</p>\n<p id=\"b973-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"931\">*931</page-number>Joanna told the two sheriffs deputies that she had information about the case they were investigating and wanted to talk to them, but was hesitant because she was afraid she had done something wrong and would be arrested. She explained that she had gone to Washington to try to get away from \u201cit,\u201d but found she could not live with \u201cit\u201d and had returned to talk to them. She also said she was ashamed of herself. It was ultimately agreed that Joanna would talk with a psychologist, Dr. Frank Dougherty, who might be able to help her overcome her reluctance to tell the deputies what she knew about the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b973-5\">On November 1, 1984, Joanna had her first session with Dr. Dougherty. She met with him again on November 2. She told him that on June 12, she went to Sly Park with defendant and Denise, and that defendant murdered Denise, but she offered no other information. She later testified that, at this juncture, she had just wanted defendant to get arrested, she was not yet ready to tell the whole truth about what she had witnessed, and that she had lied to Dr. Dougherty about certain details.</p>\n<p id=\"b973-6\">On November 2, Dr. Dougherty and Sergeant Wilson conducted an interview with Joanna that was tape-recorded. That same evening, Sergeant Wilson suggested they \u201ctake Joanna in a vehicle to the location.\u201d Joanna agreed to direct Detective Hamage, Sergeant Wilson and Dr. Dougherty along the route she took the night of the murder. They left at 9:00 p.m. Joanna directed them to Highway 50, then to the Sly Park Road turnoff. From Sly Park Road, they drove to the intersection of Mormon Emigrant Trail, crossing two dams. Whenever she told them to make a turn, they would stop after the turn. Joanna would tell them that she did not wish to go any further; she wanted to go back home. They kept reassuring her that everything was all right. As they passed the second dam, Joanna told them to drive slowly. After crossing the dam, they turned right on Ferrari Mill Road, finally reaching the intersection known as Four Comers. They stopped. Joanna \u201cwas sunk way down low\u201d in her seat and did not respond when Sergeant Wilson suggested she get out of the car. They turned around and headed back to the sheriffs office.</p>\n<p id=\"b973-7\">On November 5, 1984, Joanna and Dr. Dougherty had another session. The following day, November 6, Dr. Dougherty, Detective Hamage and Sergeant Wilson took Joanna in a vehicle and returned to Four Comers to see if Joanna could direct them any further. The closer they got to that location, the more fearful and reluctant Joanna became. Once on Ferrari Mill Road, as they approached Four Comers, Joanna said she remembered going further and started crying. At Four Comers, there was a stump with some yellow paint on it. Joanna told them to continue straight ahead, on Ferrari <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"932\">*932</page-number>Mill Road. After about a half-mile, she told them to turn around because they were on the wrong road. Back at Four Comers, Joanna said, \u201cWe went further down that road,\u201d pointing to the road where Denise\u2019s remains had been located. Joanna became very quiet and sat there crying. They returned to Placerville.</p>\n<p id=\"b974-5\">On November 7, Joanna had another session with Dr. Dougherty. After that session, Joanna gave a complete tape-recorded statement to the deputies describing the events of June 12. She said that when she saw the yellow paint on the stump she finally decided to tell the truth and leave out nothing.</p>\n<p id=\"b974-6\">On cross-examination, Joanna admitted having told a different story on November 7, compared to what she had said on the 10-minute tape prepared on November 2. The November 2 tape was played to the jury. She also admitted drinking a pint of rum and a six-pack of beer the night Denise was murdered. She stated that she applied for a reward in this case, but there was no evidence that Joanna was aware of the reward when she came forward. Joanna stated she thought the moon was full that night. In fact, it was one night before a full moon. Joanna stated that she previously recalled saying that there was a \u201cstream\u201d in the area where she had washed her face.</p>\n<p id=\"b974-7\">Whether water was actually present in the area where Joanna claimed she had washed her face was the subject of much testimony. Susan and Charles Greenwood, who lived at the end of the road where Denise\u2019s remains were located, stated there was no standing water anywhere near where Denise\u2019s body was found.</p>\n<p id=\"b974-8\">However, Ronald Jones, Director of the El Dorado County Irrigation District, testified that he maintained the rainfall records at Sly Park Dam. He stated that in 1984, it rained .19 inches on June 4, .74 inches on June 5, .24 inches on June 6, and .15 inches on June 7. Prior to June 4, the previous rainfall had occurred on May 3, 1984.</p>\n<p id=\"b974-9\">Brian Morris, a registered professional forester with the United States Forest Service who studied soil hydrology and watershed management, testified that he viewed Denise\u2019s remains on July 31, 1984, the day they were discovered. The body was on the uphill side of a log, 200 feet up the slope of the roadway, about 100 feet east of an ephemeral draw. He described such a draw as a swale with a rounded bottom that occasionally collected water. He also found culverts that would form shallow puddles during the time of a runoff. He stated that, given the rainfall in that first week of June 1984, he would reasonably expect that on June 12, 1984, water would pool and go down into the culvert.</p>\n<p id=\"b975-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"933\">*933</page-number>John Cleever, a logger, testified that he went to Four Comers on June 9, 1984 (three days before the murder) to report for work. He said that he drove up Ferrari Mill Road to Four Comers and wanted to make a right turn (onto the road where Denise\u2019s remains were found), but there was a big mudhole with standing water, so he parked elsewhere.</p>\n<p id=\"b975-5\">The Greenwoods testified that the yellow-painted stump that was identified by Joanna first appeared in August 1984, after the murder was committed.</p>\n<p id=\"b975-6\">But Dennis Ringnes, a timber sale administrator with the United States Forest Service, testified that in a timber sale, trees to be cut are painted with a special \u201ctracer\u201d paint that is kept under lock and key in order to prevent individuals from painting additional trees not included in the timber sale. He stated that the yellow stump identified by Joanna was painted with that yellow tracer paint in 1979. John Cleever also testified that the trees in that area were painted yellow prior to June 1984.</p>\n<p id=\"b975-7\">Darlene testified that she was with defendant the night Denise was murdered, and they had driven to Sports Kingdom Hall and McDonald\u2019s in Placerville. She said defendant kept a knife above the car\u2019s sun visor and handcuffs in the backseat. She stated that defendant was \u201ccleaning his gun and sharpening his knife\u201d and told her he was \u201cgoing to take care of business.\u201d On cross-examination she admitted that at the preliminary hearing, she said that petitioner had said, \u201cTonight is going to be a good night for business.\u201d She said that defendant took her back to the foster home at 10:00 p.m. She ate a banana and went to the \u201ctop of the hill\u201d near the foster home to smoke a cigarette. From that vantage point, she saw defendant pick up Denise underneath the overpass, turn around and stop. She never saw Denise again. She did not see defendant the following day.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b975-8\">On April 30, 1985, James Stalford was scouting for wood 100 yards off Ferrari Mill Road by the Four Comers intersection when he came across a \u201creversible [jacket] either dark blue or black on one side and orange on the other.\u201d He stated that underneath the coat was a purple sweatshirt, bra, tennis shoes, and denim pants. There was no blood on the clothes. Brace Nesthus stated that the reversible jacket belonged to him, and that he had loaned this jacket to Denise while they were standing by the Sports Kingdom Hall on June 12, the night Denise was murdered. Nesthus testified that he saw Joanna at that time as well, standing by the fence at the Stancil\u2019s Toyota dealership.</p>\n<p id=\"b976-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"934\">*934</page-number>On June 22, 1985, during trial, Sergeant Wilson directed Joanna to take him to the spot where Denise had been killed. Joanna did not want to go, but Sergeant Wilson insisted. Once at Four Comers, he told her to direct him. Jbanna said to drive straight ahead. After about 75 yards, Joanna said that this was not the road, and to turn around. Once back at Four Comers, at Joanna\u2019s direction, they next took the road to their right. After about 150 yards, she said that this was \u201cnot the road either,\u201d and they returned to the intersection. When he asked her which was the correct road, Joanna pointed to the road to the west. They drove down that road. Joanna told Sergeant Wilson that it was the correct road but that it looked different. Wilson said it was possible it looked different because it had been logged. At the first landing, or wide spot in the road, Joanna said she did not recall this location, but to keep going. They next went directly into some trees and Joanna stated, \u201cNow I remember this being this way.\u201d At the second wide spot, Joanna said she remembered going this way, and said to keep driving. At the third wide spot in the road she asked Wilson to stop. He asked her why. \u201cThis is the spot,\u201d she said, and she became very quiet and began to cry. Wilson stated that this was \u201calmost the same spot\u201d where the jury\u2019s bus had stopped when the jurors viewed the area where Denise\u2019s remains had been located.</p>\n<p id=\"b976-5\">D. <em>Disappearance of Lynda Burrill</em></p>\n<p id=\"b976-6\">Lynda, Shane Daniels, Sher L. (Sher), Todd Baxter, and Bob Jacobs shared a home on Benham Street in Placerville. Lynda lived at this location until she disappeared on June 29, 1984. On August 4, 1984, William Hurley and his wife were camping just off Four Comers on Ferrari Mill Road. While walking through the woods with his dog, he and his wife found a human skull and other skeletal remains scattered over an area of about 25 square yards. Through dental records, including X-rays, it was determined that the bones were Lynda\u2019s. The pathologist was unable to determine the cause of death; she could state only that there was no observable trauma to any of the bones.</p>\n<p id=\"b976-7\">A week later, Hurley and his wife returned to the area where they found the skull. They were looking for clothes. About 150 yards from where they had found the skull, the Hurleys found clothing on the ground, including a bra, panties, a lavender knit top and a yellow shirt. The four pieces of clothing were in close proximity. Sher identified those items as the clothing Lynda was wearing the night she disappeared. Lynda\u2019s mother, Sharon Burrill, also identified the clothing as belonging to Lynda.</p>\n<p id=\"b976-8\">On June 29, Sher, Baxter, Jacobs, Daniels, and Lynda had dinner at their Benham Street house. Sher testified that after Daniels and Jacobs left, she <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"935\">*935</page-number>and Lynda walked downtown. They met a friend, Darin McArthur, at the furniture store, and the three sat on a bench in front of the bakery. Sher saw Lynda go into The Oz. Lynda left The Oz with defendant and they headed toward the downtown parking lot. Sher knew defendant from The Oz and from around town. She testified that defendant and Lynda were talking. Sher asked Lynda where she and defendant were going, and Lynda told her she was going to the downtown parking lot and would be \u201cright back.\u201d McArthur also stated he saw Lynda pass by with defendant and that Lynda said she would be right back. Lynda never returned.</p>\n<p id=\"b977-5\">Cheryl Hall, who worked for the Placerville News Company, a downtown newsstand, testified that she saw Lynda and defendant walk past her newsstand on a Friday or Saturday in late June, talking to each other. Hall recounted that Sher was across the street on a bench and Lynda crossed to talk to her while defendant waited. Hall did not see what happened thereafter. Hall stated that the following day, Sher told her that Lynda had not come home and Sher \u201cwas really worried about her.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b977-6\">On Saturday, June 30, at 10:00 a.m., defendant went to Joe and Linda Crespin\u2019s house. He spoke to Linda Crespin. She remembered the date because it was her 17th wedding anniversary. She asked defendant if he was dating anyone. He replied, \u201cYes, I\u2019m seeing a girl named Lynda.\u201d She was not sure if he used the word \u201cseeing\u201d or \u201cdating.\u201d Crespin remarked on the coincidence that her own name was Linda. Defendant replied, \u201cYes, but she\u2019s not like you.\u201d He added, \u201cgirls like that should be eliminated.\u201d Crespin was sure defendant used the word \u201celiminated.\u201d Crespin stated that defendant had a scratch on his forehead and when she pointed it out, he said he got the scratch \u201ccutting wood.\u201d She later observed him put some medicine on the scratch.</p>\n<p id=\"b977-7\">A few days after Lynda\u2019s disappearance, Sher was using a pay telephone in the downtown parking lot, talking to Lynda\u2019s father, Donald Burrill. Sher saw defendant park his car, exit the vehicle, and walk with Darlene out of the parking lot. As they passed her, Sher asked defendant where Lynda had gone \u201cthat night.\u201d Defendant replied, \u201cLynda who?\u201d Sher then specified to defendant Lynda\u2019s last name (Burrill). When defendant said he \u201cdidn\u2019t know if he knew her,\u201d Sher described Lynda. Defendant then said he did not know Lynda and he was not in town that night. Sher told defendant she had seen him with Lynda that night. Defendant replied, \u201cWell, whatever.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b977-8\">Upon learning that his daughter was last seen with defendant, Donald Burrill called defendant\u2019s place of employment, the El Dorado Convalescent Hospital, and spoke to defendant on July 5 by telephone. He asked defendant: \u201cWhat did you do with my daughter?\u201d Defendant replied, \u201cDarlene and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"936\">*936</page-number>I do not know your daughter.\u201d Burrill described Lynda to defendant as a young girl acting as a counselor, helping people downtown who were on drugs. Defendant replied, \u201cDarlene and I are not on drugs. We don\u2019t take drugs.\u201d Defendant stated that he would talk to Darlene when he got off work and he would call Burrill back. About 15 to 20 minutes later, defendant telephoned Burrill and said: \u201cDarlene and I do not know Lynda. Besides, I wasn\u2019t even in town that night.\u201d Burrill testified that he had specifically told defendant the night he was concerned about was the Friday before July 5, which was June 29.</p>\n<p id=\"b978-5\">On July 20, 1984, El Dorado County Sheriff\u2019s Detective William White interviewed defendant about Lynda. At the time, all Detective White knew was that Lynda was missing under suspicious circumstances, and that defendant had been seen with her on June 29. Detective White showed him a photograph of Lynda and asked him if he knew her. Defendant said \u201cthat he may have seen her, may have known her, but his girlfriend Darlene knew her better.\u201d When asked if he had been with Lynda on the night of June 29, defendant said that \u201che could have but he didn\u2019t recall, wasn\u2019t sure.\u201d When asked if he might have accompanied Lynda to the downtown parking lot, defendant replied that \u201che may have seen her at The Oz, or may have seen her at the Bell Tower, but he didn\u2019t recall walking with her to the parking lot.\u201d Defendant then said he might have walked her to the parking lot, but he was not sure.</p>\n<p id=\"b978-6\">Darlene testified that on one occasion at the downtown parking lot, Lynda was on the phone and defendant told Darlene that \u201che knew her parents.\u201d In addition, in early November 1984, defendant told Linda Crespin that \u201c[he] and Darlene gave Lynda a ride from one comer to the next . . . close to where Lynda lives, and then [defendant] went in and told Lynda\u2019s mother that he did just that.\u201d But Lynda\u2019s mother, Sharon Burrill, testified that she did not know defendant, had never met defendant, and had never spoken to him in person or by telephone.</p>\n<p id=\"b978-7\">Lynette H. testified that she was friends with Lynda, and that she knew defendant. Lynette H. stated she would often see him at the downtown parking lot, The Oz, and the Bell Tower. In the spring of 1984, she observed Lynda and defendant together \u201cfive or six times.\u201d They would be walking together or talking, and they were usually alone. They frequented the area between the downtown parking lot and The Oz.</p>\n<p id=\"b978-8\">E. <em>Disappearance of Debbie Galston</em></p>\n<p id=\"b978-9\">Debbie disappeared on August 8, 1984. On October 27, 1984, Thomas Whisenhunt was deer hunting in the area of Baltic Ridge Road and North <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"937\">*937</page-number>South Road. About a quarter-mile from the intersection of North South Road and Baltic Ridge Road and about 150 feet off the road, Whisenhunt found the remains of a young girl. The body was about 10 feet from an oil spot and looked as if it had been dragged. No other items were found at the location. Through dental records, including X-rays, it was determined that the remains were those of Debbie. The pathologist was unable to determine the cause of death because the decomposition of the mummified remains destroyed all such evidence. The pathologist further stated that she was unable to find trauma to any of the bones.</p>\n<p id=\"b979-5\">Brenda Hartman worked with defendant at the El Dorado Convalescent Hospital. She believed that he was a judgmental person who would label young women as \u201cloose.\u201d In the middle of July of 1984, defendant offered Hartman a ride home after her car had broken down. On the way, defendant drove to the foster home to pick up Darlene. Hartman stated that Debbie was sitting on an open windowsill and said, \u201cDarlene, better watch out, Mike has a girl in the car, and he\u2019s going out on you again.\u201d Darlene came outside and called Debbie a \u201cbitch.\u201d Hartman testified that defendant told Darlene, \u201cWell, you don\u2019t have to worry about her much longer.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b979-6\">Joanna testified that several days before Debbie\u2019s disappearance, while inside the foster home, Darlene and Debbie were having an ongoing argument about defendant. When the argument moved outside, Joanna followed Darlene and Debbie because defendant was there. Joanna testified that defendant told Debbie, \u201cI\u2019m going to get you.\u201d Joanna further stated that after June 12, the date Denise disappeared, Debbie became afraid of defendant. Whenever he was around, she would leave. As Joanna explained, \u201cWherever he was at, we were not there.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b979-7\">Shawn Philpott also testified that Debbie was afraid of defendant. He stated that he had been acquainted with Debbie and had struck up a friendship with her in the weeks prior to her disappearance. On one occasion, while driving with Debbie in his truck, they saw defendant driving towards them from the opposite direction and Debbie \u201ctucked down below the front dash\u201d until defendant passed. On a second occasion, Debbie was with Philpott in front of The Oz when defendant approached in an automobile and Debbie, said Philpott, \u201cpushed me in front of her and then she proceeded to .walk behind the rest of the crowd of people.\u201d On a third occasion, by the Bell Tower, defendant approached in his car and Debbie, said Philpott, \u201ctucked behind me.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b979-8\">On August 8, 1984, while at a birthday party for Larry Vorce at Benham Park that Debbie attended, Michael Nuss saw defendant\u2019s car drive by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"938\">*938</page-number>park. The driver \u201cdrove by real slow looking through the park.\u201d All Nuss could see was that the window was down, the driver was a male with short hair and the car was traveling \u201cfive miles an hour, or slower.\u201d No one else was in the car. Nuss thought the time was about 8:00 or 8:30 p.m. Nuss had seen defendant\u2019s car earlier in the day at the AM-PM Mini-Market, when they were getting ready for the party.</p>\n<p id=\"b980-5\">About 8:30 p.m., Debbie mentioned to Vorce that she had to leave the party as she had to be back at the foster home by 9:00 p.m. Debbie asked Keith B., Katrina M., and a third person, identified only as Logan, to walk \u201cher some of the way.\u201d The three walked with her for a short distance and returned.</p>\n<p id=\"b980-6\">Darlene testified that on August 8, she and defendant spent the early evening drinking with defendant\u2019s mother and his mother\u2019s boyfriend at the mother\u2019s trailer on Big Cut Road. Upon leaving, they drove to Benham Park where Darlene used the restroom. They stayed at the park for about 15 minutes. Darlene saw Debbie at the park drinking with other people. Defendant then took Darlene home. Darlene testified that during that evening, defendant pulled a knife from his car\u2019s sun visor, put it in his pants and told Darlene \u201che had to take care of business.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b980-7\">Barbara Rugg, who worked at Nona Chapman\u2019s foster home, testified that Darlene was the first foster child to arrive home that evening. Rugg believed that Darlene returned between 7:45 and 8:00 p.m. Rugg testified that she recalled thinking this was unusual,, because Darlene usually did not return home until 11:00 p.m. or midnight.</p>\n<p id=\"b980-8\">That same day, August 8, Joanna and her boyfriend, Larry Wright, were together. They returned to the foster home about 8:30 p.m. They wanted to talk to Debbie, but she was not there. They waited until 9:00 p.m., Debbie\u2019s curfew, and then went out looking for her. They did not find her. Debbie did not return home.</p>\n<p id=\"b980-9\">On August 10, 1984, Joanna and Wright went on a picnic, intending to drive to Anderson Ridge in Wright\u2019s grandparents\u2019 truck. They took Wright\u2019s dog with them. Wright stated the purpose of the picnic was to calm Joanna down and get her away from town because Debbie was still missing and Joanna was upset. They eventually reached North South Road and the \u201cbridge to nowhere.\u201d Wright insisted that Joanna did not give him any directions as to where to drive. At the bridge, Joanna noticed a tennis shoe lying by the creek and pointed it out to Wright. They also saw some clothing in a bush on a small island in the creek. They found pants, a shirt, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"939\">*939</page-number>undergarments, another shoe and a sock. Joanna recognized the clothes as belonging to Debbie and became hysterical; she began to cry \u201cand just became unglued.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b981-5\">They gathered the clothes and put them in the back of the truck. On the way to the sheriffs office, they met Deputy Sheriff Paul Odlin at the Sly Park Dam. They led Odlin back to the \u201cbridge to nowhere,\u201d and showed him where they had found the clothing. Odlin noted that Joanna was shaky and nervous, with tears in her eyes. She kept talking about \u201chow it was Debbie\u2019s clothes and [she] was hoping [Odlin] would find her.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b981-6\">F. <em>Defendant\u2019s Statements to Darlene</em></p>\n<p id=\"b981-7\">Darlene testified under a grant of immunity. She stated that a day or two after Debbie disappeared, she was at the Exxon station in Placerville with defendant, cleaning defendant\u2019s car, when she discovered a unicorn key chain. She recognized the key chain as Debbie\u2019s. She stated that defendant asked her to \u201cput it back into Debbie\u2019s belongings.\u201d However, on two other occasions during her testimony, she said the key chain belonged to Denise. Then she corrected herself and said the key chain was Debbie\u2019s and that she put the key chain into Debbie\u2019s drawer at the foster home.</p>\n<p id=\"b981-8\">Darlene claimed that at the Exxon station, defendant told her \u201c[h]e had strangled [Denise], stabbed her [and] had sexual intercourse with her.\u201d She said defendant told her \u201c[h]e had strangled [Lynda], stabbed her and had sexual intercourse with her.\u201d She said defendant told her \u201c[h]e strangled [Debbie], stabbed her and had sexual intercourse with her.\u201d She responded, \u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d when asked whether defendant had sexual relations before or after he killed the girls. She said defendant was able to do this to the girls because he \u201chandcuffed their hands and tied their feet.\u201d She was not asked, nor did she offer any further details about the murders other than to say that defendant\u2019s statements \u201ckind of upset [her] [a]n awful lot.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b981-9\">On cross-examination, she stated that prior to testifying, she had spoken to Ron Tepper, the trial prosecutor, and Sergeant Wilson each about 50 times. She asserted that the only time defendant talked to her about the murders was that one time at the Exxon station. She said defendant told her he stabbed Denise \u201cin the stomach.\u201d Shortly thereafter, however, she changed her testimony and stated defendant stabbed Denise \u201cin the chest.\u201d She reiterated that defendant told her he tied Denise\u2019s feet, but when confronted with the fact that Denise ran away, she immediately said, \u201cNo, he didn\u2019t have time to tie up her feet.\u201d She insisted that defendant told her both Denise and Lynda were killed near North South Road. Both girls\u2019 bodies, however, were found near Ferrari Mill Road.</p>\n<p id=\"b982-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"940\">*940</page-number>Defendant married Darlene on September 15, 1984, but he ended the relationship less than two months later, on November 7 or 8, 1984. Darlene admitted that she and defendant were no longer together as of November 7, 1984, and that defendant left her for another woman. On November 9, 1984, Joanna and Darlene were together at the sheriff\u2019s station. Sergeant Wilson and Joanna told Darlene that Joanna witnessed Denise\u2019s murder. Sergeant Wilson provided Darlene with the details of Denise\u2019s murder. Defendant was arrested for the murders on November 10, 1984. Darlene admitted she first told police about the Exxon conversation after her conversation with Joanna and about two weeks after defendant was arrested.</p>\n<p id=\"b982-5\">G. <em>Darlene\u2019s Behavior After August 8, 1984</em></p>\n<p id=\"b982-6\">Immediately after Debbie\u2019s disappearance and the conversation at the Exxon station, Darlene began to act strangely. She also began to accuse defendant of committing the murders. For example, Barbara Rugg, who was in charge of the foster home during Nona Chapman\u2019s vacation, testified that on August 11, 1984, Darlene \u201cstarted talking about guts and whatnot\u201d and was acting \u201cstrange.\u201d Darlene, stated Rugg, had a knife and was \u201csinging a chant.\u201d Rugg called the police at 4:00 a.m. on Sunday, August 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b982-7\">Placerville Police Officer Dannaker arrived. Darlene told him she thought Denise and Debbie were dead. She added, \u201cI have visions about them being murdered. I see Denise being strangled and Debbie having her head bashed in.\u201d Officer Dannaker asked Darlene if defendant had anything to do with the disappearance of Denise or Debbie. She replied, \u201cI don\u2019t know, he might have.\u201d When he asked her why, Darlene said, \u201cI have these feelings. That\u2019s all I know.\u201d Darlene \u201cwas afraid that if [defendant] found out she had been talking to the Placerville Police about him that she might be hurt by him.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b982-8\">On August 12, Darlene directed Officer Dannaker and other police officers to North South Road by Camps Crossing. They were \u201cgoing to search for graves.\u201d Darlene told Rugg before she went out to look for the bodies, \u201cIt\u2019s all going to be over with, Mike\u2019s going to be arrested.\u201d Darlene directed them to the Camp Creek Bridge. Once there, however, Darlene stated she had no idea where any bodies were buried. At that point, Officer Dannaker drove her back to the foster home.</p>\n<p id=\"b982-9\">Shirley W., Darlene\u2019s mother, testified that when Debbie was missing, she received several calls from her daughter, who was \u201cvery upset, crying.\u201d She told her mother, \u201cMomma, I did not kill Debbie, Mike killed Debbie.\u201d She would not tell her mother how she knew the information.</p>\n<p id=\"b982-10\">Nona Chapman testified that when she returned to the foster home from her vacation on August 13, Darlene was an \u201centirely different person.\u201d For <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"941\">*941</page-number>example, Darlene was chopping a piece of binder paper with scissors. After Chapman told her to put down the scissors, Darlene took out her knife and jabbed another piece of paper. When Chapman asked her to put the knife down, Darlene said, \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter, are you afraid I\u2019ll stab you?\u201d On August 14, because Darlene was acting so strangely, she was taken from the foster home and spent 48 hours in a psychiatric facility.</p>\n<p id=\"b983-5\">H. <em>Defendant\u2019s August 12, 1984, Encounter with Police</em></p>\n<p id=\"b983-6\">On August 12, 1984, Officer Dannaker located defendant asleep in his car. He observed a gun handle protruding from under the driver\u2019s seat and recovered from the vehicle a fully loaded .357-caliber Smith and Wesson revolver, a small, fully loaded Ruger 10/22 rifle, and a .380-caliber Armi Tanfoglio semiautomatic pistol and matching ammunition. Handcuffs were also located in the rear floorboard area. A knife and scabbard were found in the trunk.</p>\n<p id=\"b983-7\">That same day, Placerville Police Sergeant William Scholtz took a tape-recorded statement from defendant. The tape was transcribed and most parts were read verbatim to the jury. Sergeant Scholtz told defendant he wanted to talk about the disappearance of Darlene\u2019s roommate. Defendant stated: \u201cI knew her. She used to live with Darlene. Her name was Debbie. I don\u2019t know her last name.\u201d Defendant was asked when he last saw Debbie. He replied: \u201cWell, when I went to pick up Darlene the other day\u2014I don\u2019t remember what day it was. If you ask Darlene, she will tell you.\u201d When asked if this was the day she disappeared, defendant stated: \u201cI didn\u2019t even know she was missing until a couple of days ago when she said\u2014when Darlene said that the girl didn\u2019t come home. I don\u2019t have anything to do with the girls there period.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b983-8\">Later in the interview, defendant again was asked about his activities on Wednesday, August 8. He stated, \u201cYeah, Darlene told me the girl was missing that day. We went to my mother\u2019s.\u201d He claimed not to have seen Debbie at Benham Park. Other than visiting his mother, defendant had no specific recollection of Wednesday night, August 8, four days earlier. When asked if he stayed at the park for a while, defendant stated: \u201cWe usually stay [at my mother\u2019s] until dark or just before dark.\u201d \u201cThen we go down just by Stancil\u2019s Toyota for maybe an hour unless I\u2019m tired and take her home.\u201d After finding out that defendant usually slept in his car in one of two places, the officer asked: \u201cDo you recall what you did on Wednesday night?\u201d Defendant replied, \u201cI just told you.\u201d The officer said, \u201cNo, I mean after you dropped off Darlene.\u201d Defendant said, \u201cYes, I went to the church parking lot and went to sleep. I don\u2019t remember that night specifically\u2014before I was sleeping more at the gym.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b984-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"942\">*942</page-number>Defendant also admitted that he was familiar with Sly Park and North South Roads, He stated that he went camping there with Darlene \u201cas often as we can.\u201d When asked if he knew the Sly Park area very well, defendant stated, \u201cWell, I know the lake and I know the campground I\u2019ve camped at.\u201d The officer asked, \u201cWhat about other than Sly Park?\u201d Defendant replied, \u201cNorth South Road .... There\u2019s a place called Camp Creek which I don\u2019t know is how many miles out but it was full so we came back and parked at the bridge where Darlene said that they found the girl\u2019s clothes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b984-5\">I. <em>Other Evidence</em></p>\n<p id=\"b984-6\">In early September 1984, Patricia Kelly worked at the front desk and was a salesperson for Diamond Springs Racquet Fitness Center. Defendant was a member and would be there \u201cjust about every single morning\u201d when the club opened. Kelly suspected her husband of seeing another woman who was only 18 years old and discussed her suspicions with defendant. She stated she was upset because she was much older than the girl and the situation \u201creally bothered her.\u201d Defendant replied, \u201cWhores like that should be eliminated.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b984-7\">Shirley W. testified that in late September 1984, Darlene and defendant were visiting, and Darlene wanted to show her newspaper clippings about Debbie and Denise. Shirley W. stated that she told Darlene that she did not want to read the articles. Defendant then volunteered that they \u201cwere whores and tramps and they should have been killed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b984-8\">Joe Crespin met defendant through cutting his hair at his barbershop. He stated they were good friends. He would see defendant with some regularity and they would talk. Crespin testified that on a Sunday in late August 1984, he and defendant were driving south on North South Road by the Camp Creek Bridge, and defendant, pointing to the left-hand side of the bridge, told Crespin that was where Debbie\u2019s clothes were found. (That was the side of the bridge underneath which Debbie\u2019s clothes were located.) Because it \u201ckind of shocked [him] a little bit,\u201d Crespin asked defendant how he knew this information, and defendant replied that Darlene told him.</p>\n<p id=\"b984-9\">In early November 1984, defendant spoke with Joe and Linda Crespin and the subject of how the girls were killed came up. Defendant said, \u201cIf I had stabbed the three girls would I be sitting here talking to you now?\u201d It never occurred to Linda Crespin to ask defendant how he knew the three girls had met their deaths by stabbing. Joe Crespin also remembered the stabbing reference.</p>\n<p id=\"b984-10\">On November 21, 1984, Sergeant Wilson obtained a search warrant to search defendant\u2019s car, which had been impounded on the day of his arrest, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"943\">*943</page-number>November 10. Inside the car, Sergeant Wilson found a hunting knife and sheath \u201cup in the passenger side sun visor,\u201d and a buck knife and sheath on the backseat. He found a pair of handcuffs underneath the driver\u2019s seat and some nylon rope and rock pitons in the trunk area. There was no blood on either the knife or the sheath. However, a blood expert testified that if a knife had been wiped clean before being placed in the sheath, it would not be expected that blood would be found inside the sheath.</p>\n<p id=\"b985-5\">It was stipulated that no human blood was found on Debbie\u2019s or Lynda\u2019s clothing. No fingerprints of any of the victims were found in defendant\u2019s car or on items recovered as part of the investigation. No blood evidence linking defendant to the victims was introduced during the trial. The jury visited the various locations about which witnesses testified.</p>\n<p id=\"b985-6\">The black jacket found on April 30, 1985, with Denise\u2019s clothes was originally thought to be defendant\u2019s. Testimony was elicited to that effect from defendant\u2019s mother, Joe Crespin, and Sergeant Wilson. However, during trial, Bruce Nesthus positively identified the jacket as his, saying he lent it to Denise the night she was murdered. This disclosure prompted Sergeant Wilson to insist that Joanna take him to the location of Denise\u2019s murder on June 22, 1985, while the jury trial was in progress.</p>\n<p id=\"b985-7\">J. <em>Joanna\u2019s and Defendant\u2019s Knowledge of Undisclosed Facts</em></p>\n<p id=\"b985-8\">Sergeant Wilson testified that in a homicide investigation, he did not release to the public all the information in his possession \u201cjust in case someone came forward to give information, [he] would use that piece of [withheld] information and check their story.\u201d To his knowledge, there was no specific newspaper article that stated that the spot where Denise\u2019s body was found was reached by driving down Ferrari Mill Road to Four Comers and turning right.</p>\n<p id=\"b985-9\">The prosecutor brought in representatives from the relevant newspapers (the Mountain Democrat, the Sacramento Bee, the El Dorado Gazette and Foothill Times), radio stations (KAHEKHYL), and television stations (channels 3, 10, 13, 31 and 40) to prove that the media had never disclosed (1) the precise location where Debbie\u2019s clothes were found; (2) the location where Denise\u2019s remains were found; or (3) that Denise was stabbed to death.</p>\n<p id=\"b985-10\">For example, an article in the Sacramento Bee, dated August 21, 1984, stated, \u201cGalton\u2019s <em>[sic: </em>Galston\u2019s] 14-year-old sister, Debbie, is missing and some other clothing has been found in a forest at Camp Creek where the two girls\u2019 bodies were found.\u201d An article dated August 30, 1984 stated, \u201c[Debbie\u2019s] clothes were found August 10th, at North South Road at Camp Creek about 10 miles west of where the two dead girls were found.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b986-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"944\">*944</page-number>An October 30, 1984 article in the Sacramento Union stated: \u201cThe remains of the three teenagers have been found since July 31st in a forest near Camp Creek off North South Road east of Placerville. Skeletal remains found in the El Dorado National Forest were identified Monday as those of 14-year-old Debbie Galston.\u201d The article continued: \u201cTwo days later, her roommate and her boyfriend found Debbie\u2019s folded clothing, underwear, shoes and socks by a Camp Creek bridge while on a picnic, sheriffs deputies said.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b986-5\">One radio broadcast, airing August 4, 1984, stated only that Denise Galston\u2019s body was found \u201capproximately one-half mile west of Ferrari Mill Road.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b986-6\">And an article in the Mountain Democrat, dated August 22, 1984, quoted Lieutenant Howard Wilson as saying: \u201c \u2018Whether the victims were strangled, poisoned, stabbed . . . may never be known unless someone decides to talk about it.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b986-7\">II. Penalty Phase</p>\n<p id=\"b986-8\">A. <em>The Prosecution Case</em></p>\n<p id=\"b986-9\">The People put on no new evidence, relying solely on the circumstances of the three murders of which defendant was found guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b986-10\">B. <em>The Defense Case</em></p>\n<p id=\"b986-11\">Lloyd Kelley supervised defendant\u2019s forestry work for five months in 1978. Defendant took charge of the crew and acted as the leader in Kelley\u2019s absence. Defendant was a \u201cvery, very dependable\u201d worker, and Kelley would hire him again. Defendant never used abusive language toward the female members of the crew.</p>\n<p id=\"b986-12\">Godfried German supervised defendant on a youth forestry conservation crew for three terms of 90 days each around 1975. Defendant was lead man for the crew part of the time. He was trustworthy and dependable. German stated he would hire defendant again.</p>\n<p id=\"b986-13\">Defendant worked for Maijorie Comer as a student aide in the library at El Dorado High School in 1974 or 1975. Defendant\u2019s picture was hung on the library\u2019s bulletin board as a \u201cspecial kid\u201d because of his good work. Comer stated that she gave defendant an A-plus for his work, which is unusual for her.</p>\n<p id=\"b986-14\">Jean Stokes, defendant\u2019s mother, stated that she did not live with or marry his father. When defendant was about one year old, she married Forest <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"945\">*945</page-number>Jayne. From the time defendant was 14 months old until he left home at age 16, defendant would often be disciplined and beaten by Jayne. Defendant was the oldest of six children. When he was about six years old, he swallowed gasoline and became ill. He shook all over. He was put in the hospital for a week. Phenobarbital was administered to calm him. He was not taken off this medication until he was about 10 years old.</p>\n<p id=\"b987-5\">Stokes suspected Jayne was molesting defendant. On one occasion, Jayne and defendant, then age 14, were alone together in Carmel (at Jayne\u2019s home/office). Stokes said she drove to Carmel, and tried to enter the location but the door was locked. When Jayne and defendant finally opened the door, she felt \u201csomething very bad was going on.\u201d When defendant was 12, the family had to move because Jayne got three neighborhood boys drunk and molested one of them.</p>\n<p id=\"b987-6\">Defendant, she said, took care of his younger siblings. He got them up for school, helped fix their dinners and tried to keep his family together. Once, during a snowstorm, Jayne drove the family car off a cliff and the car rolled over four or five times. Defendant rescued the baby and his mother, fearing the car would roll over again. He ran two miles in the snow to get help for his mother, who had broken her ribs. When she got home from the hospital, defendant helped and took care of the children.</p>\n<p id=\"b987-7\">Defendant had been married and had three children. He helped deliver his son. Stokes testified that this period occurred four or five years prior to the trial. Defendant, at the time, was very happy. Then, while he was back east in the Army, defendant learned from his grandfather that his wife had moved another man into their home. Defendant was upset. He was able to get out of the Army to address this situation. Defendant changed after he came home and his family was broken up. He was \u201churting very badly.\u201d He would take long walks. He drank. He was quiet. He seemed unable to \u201cget it together,\u201d and wanted to be alone. This is when he began to judge and classify people.</p>\n<p id=\"b987-8\">On cross-examination, Stokes said that after divorcing Jayne, she remarried and had a sixth child at age 40, when defendant was over 18. Defendant did not like his new sister and thought she was a \u201cbrat.\u201d When she was about two and a half to three years old, the child fell into some water. Defendant, who had been drinking, made no effort to save her, and another person pulled her out of the water.</p>\n<p id=\"b987-9\">Carolyn Jayne, defendant\u2019s half sister, testified on his behalf. She corroborated prior testimony that her father beat defendant and sexually abused him, and that defendant was instrumental in raising the other children. She <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"946\">*946</page-number>corroborated prior testimony that they had to move one time because their father had molested some young boys in the area.</p>\n<p id=\"b988-5\">Albert Globus, a psychiatrist, testified on defendant\u2019s behalf. He first examined defendant on December 12, 1984. He had read all the police and sheriffs reports about the case. He reviewed a neurological evaluation by Dr. A.T. Vogt, a clinical psychologist; the medical records of defendant\u2019s physician, Dr. Talcott Bates; the records of two electroencephalograms conducted on defendant in May 1963 and June 1962; the progress notes Dr. Bates made when treating defendant for a seizure disorder; a telephone conversation with defendant\u2019s attorney about defendant\u2019s biological father; psychological tests of defendant performed on July 19, 1985, by Dr. Edwards, a psychologist; an electroencephalographic report on defendant dated July 19, 1985; and a psychological evaluation by Dr. William G. Danton. Dr. Globus diagnosed defendant as having alcohol abuse in remission and organic brain syndrome, which he described as \u201csome damage or deficit in function of nerve cells of the brain,\u201d which he characterized, in defendant\u2019s case, as mild.</p>\n<p id=\"b988-6\">It was stipulated that defendant had suffered no prior felony convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b988-7\">C. <em>Rebuttal</em></p>\n<p id=\"b988-8\">Joseph Chandler said that defendant was his foreman during the nine months he worked for the forestry service in 1979 or 1980. Defendant generally supervised nine people, including three women. Chandler stated that defendant \u201cenjoyed the power he had as foreman and really tended to push it around quite heavily. He would make work extremely hard for some of the people he didn\u2019t like and made it great for those that he did, preferably the women.\u201d In the absence of the women, he talked about specific body parts and told the men \u201cwhat he would like to do [to the women], and when he would offer to do that to them and they would turn him down, and he joked around about it to us.\u201d Most of the crew found defendant\u2019s behavior highly offensive.</p>\n<p id=\"b988-9\">Wayne Rice, like Chandler, worked under defendant for about nine months in 1977 or 1978. With women, defendant \u201cwould mention sexual things he would like to do to [the women members of the crew] and what he would like to have them do to him.\u201d Rice, who was 16 years old at the time, was so angered by defendant\u2019s words that he hit defendant with a tire iron in the presence of the other crew members. Rice admitted that he had suffered a prior felony conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b989-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"947\">*947</page-number>III. Discussion\u2014Guilt Phase</p>\n<p id=\"b989-5\">A. <em>Prior Representation of Prosecution Witnesses by Defense Counsel</em></p>\n<p id=\"b989-6\">Defendant contends that he was deprived of effective assistance of counsel due to conflicts of interest arising from his attorneys\u2019 prior representation of four prosecution witnesses. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b989-7\">1. <em>Factual Background</em></p>\n<p id=\"b989-8\">Prior to the preliminary hearing, Defense Counsel Patrick Forester, an assistant public defender, informed the court that a year earlier his office had represented Darlene\u2019s mother, Shirley W., who was then a prospective witness in a separate case in which the state sought to have Darlene declared a ward of the court on the basis of alleged sexual molestation by Gerald W., her stepfather. John Sudman, a deputy public defender in the same office as Forester, appeared as Shirley W.\u2019s counsel at the detention, jurisdictional, dispositional, and review hearings. The petition was found true on January 27, 1984, and Darlene was made a ward of the court. On October 2, 1984, the public defender\u2019s office ceased its representation of Shirley W.</p>\n<p id=\"b989-9\">In light of this information, the trial court appointed John Olson as counsel for Shirley W. in order to advise her of her attorney-client privileges arising from that earlier representation. After consulting with Olson, Shirley W. agreed in open court to waive any privileges she may have had, and agreed that she could be cross-examined as to any discussions she had with Sudman.</p>\n<p id=\"b989-10\">On March 1, 1985, Forester declared a conflict of interest in a case involving James Carter, a potential prosecution witness. Forester never represented Carter. Attorney Stephen Tapson was appointed to represent Carter. On March 6, Tapson was replaced by another attorney, in anticipation of his appointment in the Cox case as second attorney. On March 7, Tapson was appointed as second attorney in the Cox case. Tapson represented that \u201cat no time\u201d had he talked to Carter. Forester informed the court that he explained the situation to defendant. Defendant then indicated to the court that despite this \u201cpossible conflict of interest,\u201d he still wanted Tapson appointed. Defendant specifically agreed to waive any possible conflict of interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b989-11\">Another potential witness, Darin McArthur, had previously been represented by Tapson\u2019s firm. Tapson informed all parties that he had had no contact with McArthur. Defendant again agreed to waive any possible <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"948\">*948</page-number>conflict of interest arising from that case. Forester indicated for the record that he fully discussed this situation with defendant, including the nature of the cases in which witnesses Carter and McArthur were involved, and defendant still wanted Tapson appointed. Defendant confirmed this statement to the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b990-5\">During trial, Lisa D. was called as a prosecution witness. Tapson indicated that the witness had previously been represented in juvenile court by another member of his firm. Tapson also indicated that his firm did not currently represent Lisa D. Tapson told the court that he was unsure if these facts constituted a conflict of interest. Forester indicated the defense would seek to impeach Lisa D. with her juvenile grand theft \u201cconviction.\u201d The prosecutor thereafter agreed to raise this issue on direct examination. The court ruled there was no conflict of interest. Defendant never objected to his continued representation by counsel in light of any of these alleged conflicts of interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b990-6\">2. <em>Legal Principles</em></p>\n<p id=\"b990-7\">The right to effective assistance of counsel, secured by the Sixth Amendment to the federal Constitution, and article I, section 15 of the California Constitution, includes the right to representation that is free from conflicts of interest. <em>(People v. Bonin </em>(1989) 47 Cal.3d 808, 833 [254 Cal.Rptr. 298, 765 P.2d 460] <em>(Bonin).) </em>To establish a federal constitutional violation, a defendant who fails to object at trial \u201cmust establish that an actual conflict of interest adversely affected his lawyer\u2019s performance.\u201d <em>(Cuyler v. Sullivan </em>(1980) 446 U.S. 335, 350 [100 S.Ct. 1708, 1719, 64 L.Ed.2d 333].) The <em>Sullivan </em>court made clear \u201cthat the possibility of conflict is insufficient to impugn a criminal conviction.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b990-8\">\u201cTo show a violation of the corresponding right under our state Constitution, a defendant need only demonstrate a <em>potential </em>conflict, so long as the record supports an \u2018informed speculation\u2019 that the asserted conflict adversely affected counsel\u2019s performance. [Citations].\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Frye </em>(1998) 18 Cal.4th 894, 998 [77 Cal.Rptr.2d 25, 959 P.2d 183].) \u201cBut \u2018[permissible speculation giving rise to a conflict of interest may be deemed an informed speculation . . . only when such is grounded on a factual basis that can be found in the record.\u2019 \u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Belmontes </em>(1988) 45 Cal.3d 744, 776 [248 Cal.Rptr. 126, 755 P.2d 310] <em>(Belmontes), </em>quoting <em>People v. Cook </em>(1975) 13 Cal.3d 663, 670-671 [119 Cal.Rptr. 500, 532 P.2d 148].)</p>\n<p id=\"b990-9\">To determine whether counsel\u2019s performance was \u201cadversely affected,\u201d we have suggested that <em>Sullivan </em>requires an inquiry into whether counsel \u201cpulled his punches,\u201d i.e., whether counsel failed to represent defendant as vigorously as he might have, had there been no conflict. <em>(People v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"949\">*949</page-number><em>Easley </em>(1988) 46 Cal.3d 712, 725 [250 Cal.Rptr. 855, 759 P.2d 490].) In undertaking such an inquiry, we are, as stated, bound by the record. But where a conflict of interest causes an attorney <em>not </em>to do something, the record may not reflect such an omission. We must therefore examine the record to determine (i) whether arguments or actions omitted would likely have been made by counsel who did not have a conflict of interest, and (ii) whether there may have been a tactical reason (other than the asserted conflict of interest) that might have caused any such omission. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 727.) In any event, a defendant may properly waive his right, to the assistance of an attorney unhindered by a conflict of interest. <em>(Holloway v. Arkansas </em>(1978) 435 U.S. 475, 483, fn. 5 [98 S.Ct. 1173, 1178, 55 L.Ed.2d 426]; <em>Bonin, supra, </em>47 Cal.3d at p. 837.)</p>\n<p id=\"b991-5\">3. <em>Discussion</em></p>\n<p id=\"b991-6\">This is not a case in which defense counsel has undertaken multiple representation of defendants with competing interests. (See, e.g., <em>Holloway </em>v. <em>Arkansas, supra, </em>435 U.S. 475.) Nor is it a case in which a former client was called as a witness, and was alleged to have \u201cmasterminded\u201d the crime in which the current client was presently on trial. <em>(Leversen v. Superior Court </em>(1983) 34 Cal.3d 530 [194 Cal.Rptr. 448, 668 P.2d 755].)  Instead, this is a case where three of four witnesses were previously represented by other attorneys in counsel\u2019s firm in matters that were unrelated to the current trial, and where counsel was appointed to represent the fourth witness, but never spoke to the witness before being replaced. (See, e.g., <em>Belmontes, supra, </em>45 Cal.3d at p. 776.)</p>\n<p id=\"b991-7\">A conflict <em>may </em>arise if a former client is a witness in a new case because the attorney is forbidden to use against a former client any confidential information acquired during that attorney-client relationship. <em>(Bonin, supra, </em>47 Cal.3d at p. 835; <em>Leversen </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>34 Cal.3d at p. 538.)</p>\n<p id=\"b991-8\">But if the attorney possesses no such confidential information, courts have routinely held that no actual or potential conflict of interest exists. For example, in <em>People </em>v. <em>Lawley </em>(2002) 27 Cal.4th 102, 145-146 [115 Cal.Rptr.2d 614, 38 P.3d 461], we upheld the trial court\u2019s ruling that no conflict existed, given that advisory counsel possessed no confidential information stemming from his prior representation of a prosecution witness in several factually unrelated cases. Similarly, in <em>People </em>v. <em>Clark </em>(1993) 5 Cal.4th 950, 1001-1002 [22 Cal.Rptr.2d 689, 857 P.2d 1099] <em>(Clark), </em>we held that no actual or potential conflict existed where the public defender possessed no confidential information stemming from his prior representation of three prosecution witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b992-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"950\">*950</page-number>In <em>Belmontes, supra, </em>45 Cal.3d at pages 774-777, we held that the record did not establish that counsel had an actual or potential conflict of interest stemming from his firm\u2019s prior representation of the codefendant, because the attorney possessed no confidential information stemming from that earlier representation. (See also <em>Vangsness v. Superior Court </em>(1984) 159 Cal.App.3d 1087, 1089-1092 [206 Cal.Rptr. 45] [same].)</p>\n<p id=\"b992-5\">In the present matter, defendant has made no showing that an actual or potential conflict existed that adversely affected counsel\u2019s performance. Instead, defendant makes only the conclusory assertion that defense counsel could not effectively cross-examine witnesses Lisa D., McArthur, and Carter as to the \u201ccircumstances of the charges upon which counsel formerly represented them.\u201d Defendant makes no claim that defense counsel could not effectively cross-examine these witnesses as to their testimony in the current case, nor does he assert that defense counsel even possessed confidential information acquired during the former representation. Defendant\u2019s assertion falls far short of an informed speculation grounded in a factual basis that can be found in the record. <em>(Belmontes, supra, </em>45 Cal.3d at p. 776.)</p>\n<p id=\"b992-6\">For example, Lisa D. testified that while she was with Lynda and two other girls, defendant asked them: \u201cHey sluts, does your mama know where you are?\u201d She also stated she saw defendant and Lynda together in the downtown parking lot. Forester, not Tapson, vigorously cross-examined Lisa D. This last fact is relevant because any alleged conflict as to Lisa D. arose from her relationship with Tapson, not Forester. We have held that it is appropriate for a cocounsel who has no conflict with a witness to conduct cross-examination. (See, e.g., <em>Clark, supra, </em>5 Cal.4th at p. 1002 [no conflict where cocounsel, who had not represented witness, conducted cross-examination].) We hold that no actual or potential conflict existed as to witness Lisa. D.</p>\n<p id=\"b992-7\">James Carter testified that he saw Denise the night she disappeared and that the last person he saw her with was <em>not </em>defendant. Darin McArthur testified that he saw defendant and Lynda together the night she disappeared. Nothing in the record suggests, nor has defendant alleged, that Forester possessed confidential information stemming from the public defender\u2019s prior representation of Carter. Tapson stated he had never met Carter and represented to the court that he possessed no confidential information. Tapson also stated that he had no confidential information regarding McArthur stemming from his firm\u2019s prior representation of him. Based on this record, we hold that no actual or potential conflict of interest existed as to witnesses Carter and McArthur.</p>\n<p id=\"b992-8\">Finally, as to Shirley W., after consultation with an independent lawyer, she waived, in open court, any attorney-client privilege she possessed and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"951\">*951</page-number>agreed she could be cross-examined as to any discussions she had with the public defender\u2019s office. As defendant\u2019s counsel were not forbidden from using any confidential communications against Shirley W., there was no actual or potential conflict of interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b993-5\">B. <em>The Prosecutor\u2019s Reference to a Polygraph Examination</em></p>\n<p id=\"b993-6\">1. <em>Factual Background</em></p>\n<p id=\"b993-7\">During the testimony of Joanna, the sole eyewitness to the murder of Denise, the prosecutor asked on direct examination, \u201cDid someone come along from the District Attorney\u2019s Office and talk to you, a man that gave you a polygraph?\u201d Joanna replied, \u201cYes, sir.\u201d The prosecutor then asked, \u201cDid you tell him what had happened . . . .\u201d The prosecutor was interrupted and Forester asked for a bench conference. He vigorously objected. The jury was excused and the matter was heard.</p>\n<p id=\"b993-8\">The prosecutor informed the court that Joanna had been untruthful during this polygraph examination. The judge nonetheless chastised the prosecutor: \u201c[T]he evil of the question when you ask if she met with someone who gave her a polygraph examination, because of your position, it would seem to me a logical inference for the jury to conclude is that the District Attorney had a polygraph given to this lady, he\u2019s an honorable man, and she didn\u2019t pass it, so he wouldn\u2019t be here seeking her testimony in the court. I see it as error on your part to have asked the question.\u201d The defense declined the prosecutor\u2019s offer to stipulate that Joanna was untruthful. The court restated that the question itself was \u201cclear error\u201d and gave the defense the weekend to decide if it wanted to request a mistrial. In the interim, the court ruled that Joanna\u2019s testimony would continue, and the answer would be struck. The court gave the jury the following admonition: \u201cLadies and gentlemen of the jury, a question was put to you shortly before the recess that was to the effect as to whether or not the witness recalled talking to a polygraph operator. That question is struck. You are cautioned to disregard it. You are to treat it as though you never heard it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b993-9\">Thereafter, the prosecutor asked Joanna if she recalled talking to a Gene or Raymond Hawkins from the district attorney\u2019s office. When she replied yes, the prosecutor elicited that she was untruthful to him and, later, to other members of law enforcement. Joanna testified that she told the truth only after her last counseling session with Dr. Dougherty on November 7, 1984. Defendant\u2019s subsequent motion for a mistrial was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b993-10\">2. <em>Applicable Law</em></p>\n<p id=\"b993-11\">Evidence Code section 351.1, subdivision (a) prohibits \u201cany reference to an offer to take, the failure to take, or the taking of a polygraph examination,\u201d unless all parties stipulate to the admission of such results. Defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"952\">*952</page-number>claims (1) that the prosecutor committed gross misconduct by asking the polygraph question and the court should have granted the mistrial because the court\u2019s admonition did not cure the prejudicial impact of the question; and (2) the mere asking of the question denied him the right to effectively cross-examine Joanna.</p>\n<p id=\"b994-5\">Defendant\u2019s first claim is fairly broken down into two parts: (a) that the prosecutor committed misconduct by informing the jury that Joanna took a polygraph test and such misconduct prejudiced defendant; and (b) that the trial court should have granted the motion for a mistrial because of the prejudicial impact of the prosecutor\u2019s question.</p>\n<p id=\"b994-6\">a. <em>Alleged Prosecutorial Misconduct</em></p>\n<p id=\"b994-7\">\u201cIt is, of course, misconduct for a prosecutor to \u2018intentionally elicit inadmissible testimony.\u2019 [Citations.]\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Bonin </em>(1988) 46 Cal.3d 659, 689 [250 Cal.Rptr. 687, 758 P.2d 1217].) To preserve such a claim, the defendant must generally object and request the court to admonish the jury to disregard the misconduct. \u201cThe reason for this rule, of course, is that \u2018the trial court should be given an opportunity to correct this abuse and thus, if possible, prevent by suitable instructions the harmful effect upon the minds of the jury.\u2019 [Citations.]\u201d <em>(People v. Green </em>(1980) 27 Cal.3d 1, 27 [164 Cal.Rptr. 1, 609 P.2d 468] <em>(Green).) </em>\u201c \u2018What is crucial to a claim of prosecutorial misconduct is not the good faith <em>vel non </em>of the prosecutor, but the potential injury to the defendant.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(People v. Williams </em>(1997) 16 Cal.4th 153, 252-253 [66 Cal.Rptr.2d 123, 940 P.2d 710] <em>(Williams).)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b994-8\">Defendant\u2019s prosecutorial misconduct contentions must fail. Here, it cannot be said that the prosecutor\u2019s asking of a single question in violation of Evidence Code section 351.1 constituted a pattern of conduct so egregious that it rendered the trial fundamentally unfair in denial of defendant\u2019s federal constitutional right to due process of law. <em>{People </em>v. <em>Samayoa </em>(1997) 15 Cal.4th 795, 841 [64 Cal.Rptr.2d 400, 938 P.2d 2].) Moreover, even assuming the prosecutor\u2019s action amounted to misconduct under state law, no prejudice appears. In response to defendant\u2019s objection, and before Joanna could respond, the trial court immediately struck the prosecutor\u2019s question and forcefully told the jurors to disregard it. (See <em>People v. Rich </em>(1988) 45 Cal.3d 1036, 1093 [248 Cal.Rptr. 510, 755 P.2d 960] [concluding that a timely objection to a question pertaining to polygraph examinations of witnesses other than the defendant would have cured any error].) Additionally, the conduct at issue was an isolated instance in an otherwise well-conducted month-long trial in which 90 witnesses testified. (See <em>People v. Smithey </em>(1999) 20 Cal.4th 936, 961 [86 Cal.Rptr.2d 243, 978 P.2d 1171] [no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"953\">*953</page-number>prejudice resulting from isolated instance of a prosecutor\u2019s attempt to elicit inadmissible opinion from an expert witness].) No basis for reversal appears.</p>\n<p id=\"b995-5\">b. <em>Mistrial</em></p>\n<p id=\"b995-6\">We review the denial of a motion for mistrial under the deferential abuse of discretion standard. <em>(People v. Cunningham </em>(2001) 25 Cal.4th 926, 984 [108 Cal.Rptr.2d 291, 25 P.3d 519]; <em>People v. Price </em>(1991) 1 Cal.4th 324, 428 [3 Cal.Rptr.2d 106, 821 P.2d 610] <em>(Price).) </em>\u201cA motion for mistrial is directed to the sound discretion of the trial court. We have explained that \u2018[a] mistrial should be granted if the court is apprised of prejudice that it judges incurable by admonition or instruction. [Citation.] Whether a particular incident is incurably prejudicial is by its nature a speculative matter, and the trial court is vested with considerable discretion in ruling on mistrial motions.\u2019\u201d <em>(People v. Jenkins </em>(2000) 22 Cal.4th 900, 985-986 [95 Cal.Rptr.2d 377, 997 P.2d 1044], quoting <em>People v. Haskett </em>(1982) 30 Cal.3d 841, 854 [180 Cal.Rptr. 640, 640 P.2d 776] <em>(Haskett).)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b995-7\">In the context of erroneously offered polygraph evidence, we have held that a trial court\u2019s timely admonition, which the jury is presumed to have followed, cures prejudice resulting from the admission of such evidence. For example, in <em>Price, </em>a prosecution witness admitted, on cross-examination, having taken lie detector tests. Defense counsel moved for a mistrial because the information gave the witness \u201ca false aura of credibility.\u201d We disagreed: \u201cThe mention of polygraphs in [the witness\u2019s] testimony was brief and nonresponsive. He did not state what questions he was asked or what the examiner concluded about his truthfulness. The admonition the court gave was thorough and forceful; it was sufficient to prevent any prejudice to defendant.\u201d <em>(Price, supra, </em>1 Cal.4th at p. 428.) We reached the same conclusion, under very similar facts, in <em>People v. Morris </em>(1991) 53 Cal.3d 152, 193-194 [279 Cal.Rptr. 720, 807 P.2d 949], (See also <em>People v. Carpenter </em>(1979) 99 Cal.App.3d 527, 532-533 [160 Cal.Rptr. 386] [prosecutor\u2019s single remark, in his opening statement, that a \u201cpolygraph operator\u201d was called in was cured by defense counsel\u2019s prompt objection and the trial court\u2019s strong admonition to the jury].) We therefore conclude that the trial court acted well within its discretion in denying defendant\u2019s mistrial motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b995-8\">No case cited by defendant compels a contrary result. For example, in <em>People v. Basuta </em>(2001) 94 Cal.App.4th 370 [114 Cal.Rptr.2d 285] <em>(Basuta), </em>the prosecutor, in trying to rehabilitate the lone witness and bolster her credibility, violated a preexisting court order not to mention that the witness had taken a polygraph test. The court held that this error, <em>in combination </em>with another, more serious error by the trial court (excluding evidence that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"954\">*954</page-number>baby\u2019s mother was physically violent to the baby, which might have been the proximate cause of the baby\u2019s death) was prejudicial. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 390-391.)</p>\n<p id=\"b996-5\">In <em>People v. Schiers </em>(1971) 19 Cal.App.3d 102, 108-114 [96 Cal.Rptr. 330] <em>(Schiers), </em>the court reversed the judgment of conviction where there was extensive testimony that the defendant had failed a polygraph exam. The admonition to the jury to disregard this testimony was not given promptly, but hours later. In <em>People v. Andrews </em>(1970) 14 Cal.App.3d 40 [92 Cal.Rptr. 49] <em>(Andrews), </em>the key prosecution witness (and former codefendant), when asked by the court whether he had taken a lie detector test and whether charges against him were dismissed thereafter, replied in the affirmative. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 44-45.) The Court of Appeal reversed the resulting judgment of conviction, as the court\u2019s question was tantamount to receiving the results of a lie detector test into evidence. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 45.)</p>\n<p id=\"b996-6\">These three cases are inapposite to the facts here. There was no combined error here (see <em>Basuta, supra, </em>94 Cal.App.4th 370), there was no receipt into evidence of defendant\u2019s failure to take a polygraph examination (see <em>Schiers, supra, </em>19 Cal.App.3d 102), nor was there the court\u2019s admission of the results of a lie detector test taken by a former codefendant (see <em>Andrews, supra, </em>14 Cal.App.3d 40). As noted, there was one improper question that was immediately struck, and the jury was given a strong admonition. The trial court properly denied defendant\u2019s motion for a mistrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b996-7\">c. <em>Right to Effective Cross-examination</em></p>\n<p id=\"b996-8\">Defendant conclusorily alleges that he was denied the right to cross-examine Joanna as a result of the prosecutor\u2019s reference to the polygraph examination. However, defendant does not explain how, where, or when this alleged deprivation took place. While this claim may stem from defense counsel Forester\u2019s statement, outside the jury\u2019s presence at the mistrial hearing, that the polygraph reference prevented him from asking questions about Joanna\u2019s being a witness to Denise\u2019s killing and finding Debbie\u2019s clothes on August 10, 1984, Forester assured the court \u201cthat at the time [I] come to that particular [point] in cross-examination, [I will] put in the record that I am not asking these questions for that reason.\u201d However, Forester made no such representation during cross-examination. As the issue was not preserved for appeal, it is deemed to have been forfeited. <em>(People v. Poggi </em>(1988) 45 Cal.3d 306, 331 [246 Cal.Rptr. 886, 753 P.2d 1082].)</p>\n<p id=\"b996-9\">Regardless, a careful review of the record reveals that counsel was not precluded from pursuing these areas in his cross-examination of Joanna. Nor was counsel prevented from asking Larry Wright about his and Joanna\u2019s discovery of Debbie\u2019s clothes. In short, this claim is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b997-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"955\">*955</page-number>C. <em>Gun Evidence</em></p>\n<p id=\"b997-5\">Defendant claims that the introduction into evidence of the three guns found during the search of his car on August 12, 1984, was prejudicial error as they \u201cwere never shown to have any connection with the commission of the offenses.\u201d While we agree that admission of the guns might have been improper if offered as \u201cother crimes\u201d evidence, under the facts of this case, the guns were sufficiently connected to the crimes; thus, their admission into evidence was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b997-6\">Darlene testified that she and defendant often went camping, and that while camping, defendant would shoot his gun. Darlene stated defendant had handcuffs and guns in his car, and kept a knife over the sun visor. When the prosecutor asked \u201chow many guns,\u201d the defense objected on relevance grounds, and argued that because Darlene\u2019s testimony would be that defendant stabbed the girls, there was no evidence showing that guns were used. The court sustained the objection on Evidence Code section 352 grounds.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b997-7\">At the prosecutor\u2019s request, the court later revisited this ruling. The prosecutor offered two theories of admissibility. First, given that the cause of death of the three victims could not be determined, it was reasonably possible that a firearm was the cause of death. Second, given that there was evidence that Debbie was afraid of defendant, the guns might have been used to coerce her into his car. Defense counsel argued that the guns were being introduced to show that defendant was a bad person. The court reversed its earlier ruling, reasoning that because the cause of death was not known, the prosecution \u201cshould be allowed to show that defendant had instruments that would allow him to overpower and cause the death of these young girls.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b997-8\">An appellate court applies the abuse of discretion standard to review any ruling by a trial court on the admissibility of the evidence, including a ruling on an Evidence Code section 352 objection. <em>(People v. Waidla </em>(2000) 22 Cal.4th 690, 724 [94 Cal.Rptr.2d 396, 996 P.2d 46].) The trial court\u2019s ruling was correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b997-9\">In <em>People v. Riser </em>(1956) 47 Cal.2d 566 [305 P.2d 1], the defendant murdered two people during a robbery. The killing was committed with a Smith and Wesson .38-caliber Special revolver. The gun was never recovered. (I<em>d. </em>at p. 573.) Riser was found with three holsters, one of which could <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"956\">*956</page-number>hold a .38-caliber Smith and Wesson Special revolver. Riser also possessed a Colt .38-caliber revolver, which could not have been the murder weapon. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 577.) We stated the rule of admissibility as follows: \u201cWhen the specific type of weapon used to commit a homicide is not known, it may be permissible to admit into evidence weapons found in the defendant\u2019s possession some time after the crime that could have been the weapons employed. There need be no conclusive demonstration that the weapon in defendant\u2019s possession was the murder weapon. [Citations.] When the prosecution relies, however, on a specific type of weapon, it is error to admit evidence that other weapons were found in his possession, for such evidence tends to show, not that he committed the crime, but only that he is the sort of person who carries deadly weapons. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>Because the murder weapon was known, we ruled that the admission of the Colt .38-caliber revolver was error, but such error was not prejudicial. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b998-5\">Here, it is not known how the three victims were killed. Although the prosecutor argued that the evidence pointed to a stabbing, such argument did not preclude the reasonable possibility that one or all three of the victims had been shot. (See, e.g., <em>People v. Manson </em>(1976) 61 Cal.App.3d 102, 207 [132 Cal.Rptr. 265] [\u201cThe trier of fact is not limited to any hierarchy of theories selected by the prosecution\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b998-6\">Moreover, given Lynda\u2019s statement to Sher when she walked off with defendant, that \u201cshe would be right back,\u201d and given the evidence of Debbie\u2019s fear of defendant and that she presumably was alone when she entered defendant\u2019s car, it is also reasonable to infer that defendant, who had unfettered access to three weapons, may have used the same to get Lynda and Debbie into his car and keep them in his car during the drive to the location of their murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b998-7\">In <em>People </em>v. <em>Carpenter </em>(1999) 21 Cal.4th 1016, 1052 [90 Cal.Rptr.2d 607, 988 P.2d 531], we held it was proper for a witness to testify that the defendant told her he kept a gun in his van. \u201cAlthough the witness did not establish the gun was necessarily the murder weapon, it might have been. . . . The evidence was thus relevant and admissible as circumstantial evidence that he committed the charged offenses.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b998-8\">We have also held that when weapons are otherwise relevant to the crime\u2019s commission, but are not the actual murder weapon, they may still be admissible. <em>(People v. Neely </em>(1993) 6 Cal.4th 877, 896 [26 Cal.Rptr.2d 189, 864 P.2d 460]; <em>People v. Lane </em>(1961) 56 Cal.2d 773, 784 [16 Cal.Rptr. 801, 366 P.2d 57].) Thus, in <em>Neely </em>we admitted evidence of a rifle located in the defendant\u2019s truck parked near the crime scene even though the rifle was not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"957\">*957</page-number>the murder weapon, as it was \u201cnot irrelevant\u201d to the charged offenses. <em>(Neely, supra, </em>6 Cal.4th at p. 896.) In <em>Lane, </em>we upheld the admission of guns found in an \u201cabandoned truck miles from the scene of the homicide,\u201d not as relevant to the homicide per se, but as weapons \u201cof a character which could be used in armed robbery ... in furtherance of the criminal plan.\u201d <em>(Lane, supra, </em>56 Cal.2d at p. 785.)</p>\n<p id=\"b999-5\">Here, the guns were relevant either as possible murder weapons, or as weapons that could have been used to coerce the victims into defendant\u2019s car or otherwise subdue them, \u201cin furtherance of the criminal plan\u201d to kill them. There was no error in admitting the guns in evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b999-6\">D. <em>Evidence of Fear of Defendant</em></p>\n<p id=\"ALe\">1. <em>Debbie</em></p>\n<p id=\"b999-7\">Joanna testified on direct examination that several days before Debbie\u2019s disappearance, Darlene and Debbie had an argument about defendant and defendant said to Debbie, \u201cI\u2019m going to get you.\u201d Joanna also testified that in the month after Denise died, Debbie appeared to be afraid of defendant. Defendant did not object to this testimony. Shawn Philpott testified regarding three instances in which Debbie hid from defendant. In the defense case, however, testimony was elicited that Joanna and Larry Wright told Sergeant Scholtz that Debbie \u201cwould get into a car with a stranger.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b999-8\">Defendant contends that it was prejudicial error to admit Philpott\u2019s testimony that Debbie hid from defendant because the evidence was not material to any disputed issue in the case and was thus irrelevant. The prosecutor\u2019s theory of admissibility was that, because Debbie\u2019s fear of defendant would prevent her from voluntarily getting into his car, it was a permissible inference that he used a weapon, such as a gun, to get Debbie into his car. The evidence was properly admitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b999-9\">Circumstantial evidence showing that the victim feared the defendant may be admissible if the acts or conduct of the victim prior to the crime are at issue. <em>(People v. Lew </em>(1968) 68 Cal.2d 774, 779 [69 Cal.Rptr. 102, 441 P.2d 942]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Armendariz </em>(1984) 37 Cal.3d 573, 586 [209 Cal.Rptr. 664, 693 P.2d 243] [evidence that the victim feared the defendant is admissible \u201cwhen the victim\u2019s conduct in conformity with that fear is in dispute\u201d]; cf. <em>People v. Ruiz </em>(1988) 44 Cal.3d 589, 608 [244 Cal.Rptr. 200, 749 P.2d 854] [victims\u2019 expressions of fear of the defendant were inadmissible where \u201cneither the states of mind of these victims prior to their deaths . . . nor their acts or conduct . . . were an issue in the case which might have been resolved or assisted by the challenged evidence\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"958\">*958</page-number>In the present case, the prosecutor\u2019s theory was that defendant drove Debbie to the murder scene in his vehicle. The circumstances surrounding Debbie\u2019s entry into defendant\u2019s car\u2014whether she would enter the car voluntarily or whether defendant may have overcome any resistance by force\u2014 were at issue. In <em>People </em>v. <em>Sakarias </em>(2000) 22 Cal.4th 596, 628-629 [94 Cal.Rptr.2d 17, 995 P.2d 152], we stated that evidence that the murder victim feared the defendant was admissible to show that she would not have voluntarily given him any of her personal property and thus it could be inferred the property was obtained by force. Here, evidence that Debbie had acted as though she feared defendant was admissible to show that she would not have voluntarily entered defendant\u2019s car and thus he may have forced her into his vehicle the night she disappeared.</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-5\">Even assuming Philpott\u2019s testimony was admitted in error, such error would be harmless. Joanna had previously testified, without objection, that Debbie was afraid of defendant. As we stated in <em>Green, supra, </em>27 Cal.3d at page 27, where evidence of fear is admitted in error but \u201cis cumulative of other properly admitted evidence to the same effect,\u201d such error is not prejudicial. It is not reasonably probable that a result more favorable to defendant would have occurred in the absence of Philpott\u2019s testimony. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Watson </em>(1956) 46 Cal.2d 818, 836 [299 P.2d 243].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-6\">2. <em>Darlene</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1000-7\">On cross-examination, defendant elicited the fact that two significant events preceded Darlene\u2019s November 1984 revelation that defendant had confessed to her at the Exxon station: (1) Darlene spoke to Joanna at the sheriff\u2019s station about Joanna\u2019s witnessing Denise\u2019s murder; and (2) defendant left Darlene in November 1984, less than two months after they were married. In this manner, defendant attempted to show that Darlene fabricated the confession.</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-8\">The prosecutor then stated that, pursuant to the \u201cstate of mind\u201d exception (Evid. Code, \u00a7 1250, subd. (a)),<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> he wanted to present evidence that on August 12, 1984, Darlene told Officer Dannaker she was afraid that defendant would hurt her if he knew she talked to the police, as well as testimony <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"959\">*959</page-number>from Barbara Rugg that on August 12, 1984, Darlene told her \u201ca couple of times\u201d that \u201cshe was afraid [defendant] would find out about her talking to the police.\u201d The prosecutor\u2019s theory was that such evidence of fear would explain why Darlene waited so long to come forward, and would rebut the defense claim of recent fabrication.</p>\n<p id=\"b1001-5\">Evidence Code section 1250, subdivision (a)(1) provides that if the declarant\u2019s state of mind \u201cis itself an issue,\u201d evidence of a statement of declarant\u2019s then existing state of mind or emotion is admissible. Typical statements considered of a state of mind include belief and knowledge. (1 Jefferson, Cal. Evidence Benchbook (Cont.Ed.Bar 3d ed. 2003) \u00a7 14.7, p. 212.) Here, defendant\u2019s claim that Darlene fabricated defendant\u2019s confession at the Exxon station squarely put Darlene\u2019s state of mind in issue. Because her fear of defendant on August 12 tended logically to provide a legitimate reason for her withholding this confession, the statements were admissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b1001-6\">Defendant claims that the court abused its discretion under Evidence Code section 352 in admitting the prejudicial evidence that Darlene feared defendant. Evidence Code section 352 rulings are reviewed under the abuse of discretion standard. <em>(People v. Alvarez </em>(1996) 14 Cal.4th 155, 214-215 [58 Cal.Rptr.2d 385, 926 P.2d 365].) The court did not abuse its discretion, as the evidence of fear was properly admitted under Evidence Code section 1250 and its probative value was not substantially outweighed by the probability of undue prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b1001-7\">E. <em>Prosecutorial Misconduct</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1001-8\">Sergeant Wilson told the jury that Joanna was placed in protective custody after she directed police to the location where Denise was killed. The court requested a sidebar conference. At sidebar, the court stated that, although there was no objection, he thought the reference to protective custody was prejudicial because the jury could infer that Joanna was placed in protective custody for fear that she would be harmed. The prosecutor told the court she was placed in protective custody \u201cto keep her from abusing herself\u2019 and offered to cure any potential misconception. The court suggested that the prosecutor talk to the witness, and a brief recess was taken. When testimony resumed, the prosecutor asked Sergeant Wilson if he was \u201cfearful if you weren\u2019t able to put [Joanna] where you had a string, so to speak, of bringing her back and forth that she might abuse herself?\u201d After Sergeant Wilson replied yes, the prosecutor asked, \u201cAnd that\u2019s the predominant reason why you effected that arrangement?\u201d Defendant objected and another sidebar conference was held. The court agreed with defendant\u2019s objection to the word \u201cpredominant,\u201d and the answer was struck. When <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"960\">*960</page-number>testimony resumed, the prosecutor asked Sergeant Wilson, \u201c[W]as that the reason she was placed in that kind of situation?\u201d Sergeant Wilson replied, \u201c[T]hat was one of the reasons.\u201d Defendant again objected. At sidebar, the court explained that it was concerned about \u201cthe unstated implication that [Joanna] was placed in protective custody because of the fear that [defendant might do some harm to her.\u201d When testimony resumed, Sergeant Wilson stated that the \u201cother reason\u201d Joanna was in protective custody was that she was \u201cpossibly a witness to a homicide.\u201d Contrary to defendant\u2019s assertions, nothing in the record suggests that the prosecutor intentionally elicited the term \u201cprotective custody\u201d to show that Joanna could be harmed by defendant. Instead, this \u201cunstated implication\u201d was a product of the court\u2019s speculation. Simply stated, defendant was arrested three days after Joanna was put in \u201cprotective custody.\u201d There was no evidence admitted showing that, during this three-day period, defendant knew Joanna had returned to Placerville one week earlier, or that she had spoken to police. The jury heard only that Joanna was an alcoholic and that the police were afraid that, as a potential witness, she might run away. \u201cWhen [a prosecutorial misconduct] claim focuses on comments made by the prosecutor before the jury, a court must determine at the threshold how the remarks would, or could, have been understood by a reasonable juror. [Citations.] If the remarks would have been taken by a juror to state or imply nothing harmful, they obviously cannot be deemed objectionable.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Benson </em>(1990) 52 Cal.Sd 754, 793 [276 Cal.Rptr. 827, 802 P.2d 330].) There was no prosecutorial misconduct based on these facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-5\">F. <em>Motion for Mistrial</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1002-6\">Joanna claimed that earlier in the evening of Denise\u2019s murder, she saw defendant in his car and he told her he wanted to speak to her. Joanna entered his vehicle. They drove to the city park and stayed in the automobile. The prosecutor asked Joanna if she could relate the substance of their conversation without repeating the specific words. Defendant objected and requested a sidebar conference. Defense counsel wanted to ensure that the specific words of defendant and Joanna\u2019s conversation, which were sexual in nature, would not be put before the jury. The prosecutor agreed that there was no need to elicit \u201cvulgarisms.\u201d When testimony resumed, the prosecutor asked Joanna, \u201cwithout using the exact words,\u201d if she could \u201ckind of put into a category\u201d what defendant said to her. Joanna replied that defendant \u201csuggested having anal sex with me.\u201d Defendant objected. The prosecutor explained, at sidebar, that Joanna related to him that defendant actually told her \u201che wanted to fuck her in the ass\u201d and he instead expected to elicit from Joanna that defendant \u201cmade a sexual overture.\u201d The court struck the question and answer and admonished the jurors to disregard it as though they had never heard it.</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"961\">*961</page-number>Defendant claims that Joanna\u2019s explicit reference to \u201canal sex\u201d was so prejudicial that the trial court erred in denying defendant\u2019s motion for a mistrial. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-5\">As noted, the court immediately struck the question and answer and admonished the jury to disregard it as though they never heard it. Recognizing that the evidence was excluded as more prejudicial than probative (Evid. Code, \u00a7 352), \u201cthe prejudice to defendant was not incurable by admonition or instruction.\u201d <em>(Price, supra, </em>1 Cal.4th at p. 431.) It must be presumed that the jurors acted in accordance with the instruction and disregarded the question and answer. (See, e.g., <em>People </em>v. <em>Rocha </em>(1971) 3 Cal.3d 893, 901 [92 Cal.Rptr. 172, 479 P.2d 372]; <em>People v. Seiterle </em>(1963) 59 Cal.2d 703, 710 [31 Cal.Rptr. 67, 381 P.2d 947].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-6\">In <em>People v. Duncan </em>(1960) 53 Cal.2d 803 [3 Cal.Rptr. 351, 350 P.2d 103], a murder case in which the prosecutor sought to portray the defendant as a sexually promiscuous woman, the trial court struck all such questions and answers and told the jury to disregard them. The defendant requested a mistrial because the questions tended to degrade and debase her. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 818.) We declared: \u201cEven if we accept defendant\u2019s contentions that the evidence objected to was inadmissible, it is clear that it did not go to the main issue in the case, and we must assume the jury obeyed the court\u2019s instructions to disregard it.\u201d <em>{Ibid.) </em>As in <em>Duncan, </em>the trial court here properly ruled that a mistrial was not warranted under these circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-7\">G. <em>Evidence That Joanna Directed Sheriffs to the Murder Scene</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1003-8\">Defendant contends it was error to admit Sergeant Wilson\u2019s testimony that on November 2, 1984, he, Detective Hamage, and Dr. Dougherty asked Joanna to direct them to the murder location. She eventually directed them to the Four Comers intersection on Ferrari Mill Road. Joanna was insistent that the windows be rolled up; she did not want to go further and was crying. Defendant also contends it was error to admit Sergeant Wilson\u2019s testimony that on November 6, 1984, the four returned to the Four Comers intersection. Joanna remembered an incline and she indicated that they (Joanna, defendant, and Denise) \u201cwent down that road,\u201d which was the road near which Denise\u2019s body was located. She also recognized a tree stump with yellow writing.</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-9\">The court admonished the jury that Joanna\u2019s statements were not admitted for the truth of the matter asserted, \u201cbut simply to allow [the jury] the indicia of what her state of mind was at that time and what the demeanor was during the course of the trip[s].\u201d And after a sidebar conference, the court further <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"962\">*962</page-number>admonished the jury that Joanna\u2019s statements concerning directions to a particular location were not being offered as direct evidence but to show her knowledge at the time the trips were made.</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-5\">The defense also objected to Sergeant Wilson\u2019s testimony that he told Joanna on June 22, 1985, to take him to the \u201cexact\u201d place where Denise was killed, which was well after the trial started and after extensive press coverage of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-6\">Defendant claims that this evidence was inadmissible hearsay that did not come within the state of mind exception set forth in Evidence Code section 1250, subdivision (a), and instead is prohibited under subdivision (b) of that statute. We disagree. Evidence Code section 1250, subdivision (a) provides that evidence of a statement of a declarant\u2019s then existing state of mind is admissible when such state of mind is itself an issue in the action, or when the evidence is offered to prove or explain acts by the declarant.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1004-7\">Joanna\u2019s statements made during the three trips fall within the Evidence Code section 1250 exception because typical statements considered of a state of mind include belief and knowledge. (1 Jefferson, Cal. Evidence Bench-book, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 14.7, p. 212.) And, as we rejected defendant\u2019s Evidence Code section 1250 claim as to Darlene\u2019s statements, <em>ante, </em>we similarly reject defendant\u2019s Evidence Code section 1250 claim that Joanna\u2019s statements were inadmissible, because these statements tended to show that Joanna knew where Denise was murdered.</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-8\">One court explained the Evidence Code section 1250 state of mind exception in the following manner: \u201cThe evidence admitted under section 1250 is hearsay; it describes a mental or physical condition . . . and is received for the truth of the matter stated. [Citation.] If offered to prove the declarant\u2019s state of mind, the statement may be introduced without limitation, subject only to [Evidence Code] section 352. However, the declarant\u2019s state of mind must be at issue in the case.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Ortiz </em>(1995) 38 Cal.App.4th 377, 389 [44 Cal.Rptr.2d 914] <em>(Ortiz).)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1004-9\">The <em>Ortiz </em>court continued: \u201cIn contrast, a statement which does not directly declare a mental state, but is merely circumstantial evidence of that state of mind, is not hearsay. It is not received for the truth of the matter stated, but rather whether the statement is true or not, the fact such statement was made is relevant to a determination of the declarant\u2019s state of mind. [Citation.] Again, such evidence must be relevant to be admissible\u2014the declarant\u2019s state of mind must be in issue. ([Evid. Code,] \u00a7 210.) A limiting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"963\">*963</page-number>instruction is required with declarations used as circumstantial evidence of the declarant\u2019s mental state; that is, the declaration is not received for the truth of the matter stated and can only be used for the limited purpose for which it is offered. ([Evid. Code,] \u00a7 355.)\u201d <em>(Ortiz, supra, </em>38 Cal.App.4th at pp. 389-390.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-5\">As a threshold matter, Joanna\u2019s state of mind was clearly at issue in this trial. The defense heavily attacked her credibility by pointing out, for example, how long it took for her to come forward as a witness, that she passed up several opportunities to inform law enforcement officials about the crime, and that she admitted telling a different story on November 7, 1984, as compared to a tape-recorded interview that took place on November 2. Indeed, the defense\u2019s theory was that Joanna was not present when Denise was murdered. Applying the principles outlined in <em>Ortiz, </em>Joanna\u2019s demeanor and her ability to give directions to the scene of the crime, the exact location of which was unreported, constituted nonhearsay circumstantial evidence of her state of mind, in this case, knowledge. This testimony was admitted with the proper limiting admonishment. It must be presumed that the jury followed the court\u2019s admonition. <em>(People v. Mickey </em>(1991) 54 Cal.3d 612, 689 [286 Cal.Rptr. 801, 818 P.2d 84].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-6\">H. <em>Absence of Defendant and Counsel from Readback of Testimony</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1005-7\">Defendant claims that he was denied due process of law because he was absent from the readback of testimony, which was a critical stage of the proceedings. This contention is without merit. We have repeatedly stated that the rereading of testimony is not a critical stage of the proceedings. (See, e.g., <em>People </em>v. <em>Ayala </em>(2000) 23 Cal.4th 225, 288 [96 Cal.Rptr.2d 682, 1 P.3d 3] <em>(Ayala); People v. Horton </em>(1995) 11 Cal.4th 1068, 1220 [47 Cal.Rptr.2d 516, 906 P.2d 478].) Moreover, defendant and his attorneys specifically waived their presence at the readback of testimony. <em>Fisher v. Roe </em>(9th Cir. 2001) 263 F.3d 906, cited by defendant, is not on point. In contrast to the situation here, the defendant and his lawyer there were excluded from the readback of testimony without their consent. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 916.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-8\">I. <em>Cumulative Error</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1005-9\">Defendant argues that the cumulative effect of all the errors he alleges rendered his proceeding fundamentally unfair. We disagree. Defendant has demonstrated few, if any, errors, and we have found each possible error to be harmless when considered in isolation. Considering them together, we likewise conclude their cumulative effect does not warrant reversal of the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"964\">*964</page-number>IV. Discussion\u2014Penalty Phase</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-5\">A. <em>Failing to Instruct on \u201cOther Crimes \u201d Evidence</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1006-6\">Defendant argues that the trial court committed prejudicial error because it failed to discharge its sua sponte duty to instruct the jury, at the penalty phase, that the jury could not consider \u201cother crimes\u201d evidence as aggravating circumstances unless it first found those crimes were proven beyond a reasonable doubt. (See, e.g., <em>People v. Robertson </em>(1982) 33 Cal.3d 21, 53-55 [188 Cal.Rptr. 77, 655 P.2d 279].) Specifically, defendant argues that the prosecutor, in his case-in-chief at the guilt phase, introduced \u201cother crimes\u201d evidence of defendant\u2019s gun possession and the fact defendant may have also raped the three victims. Thus, the court\u2019s failure to give this instruction requires reversal. This contention is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-7\">The prosecutor did not take the position or argue that evidence of defendant\u2019s supposed gun possession or sexual intercourse with the victims constituted evidence in aggravation; rather, such evidence was admitted at the guilt phase only and <em>was not mentioned </em>during the penalty phase. Indeed, both the prosecutor and defendant argued at the penalty phase as if the only aggravating circumstance at issue was the fact that defendant murdered the three teenage girls seriatim.</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-8\">In <em>People v. Maury </em>(2003) 30 Cal.4th 342, 443 [133 Cal.Rptr.2d 561, 68 P.3d 1], we stated that \u201cin the absence of a request, the trial court is under no duty to give an instruction at the penalty phase regarding evidence received at the guilt phase. [Citations.] Even when section 190.3, factor (b), criminal activity is expressly alleged, which was not the case here, \u2018the rule absolving the court of a sua sponte duty to instruct on the elements of crimes introduced under [section 190.3,] factor (b) \u201c \u2018is based in part on a recognition that, as [a] tactical matter, the defendant \u201cmay not want the penalty phase instructions . . . [to] lead the jury to place undue emphasis on the crimes rather than on the central question of whether he should live or die.\u201d [Citations.]\u2019 \u201d \u2019 [Citation.] If a trial court need not instruct a jury sua sponte as to the elements of alleged other crimes, given the possible undue emphasis which the defense may fear the jury will place on them [citation], a trial court is obviously under no sua sponte obligation to instruct the jury on the prosecution\u2019s burden of proving other crimes that are not clearly introduced under section 190.3, factor (b). [Citations.]\u201d Based on the foregoing authority, the court was not required to instruct the jury on other crimes evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-9\">B. <em>Brown Error</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1006-10\">Defendant claims that the court\u2019s penalty phase instructions, in conjunction with his attorney\u2019s closing argument, misled the jury as to its sentencing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"965\">*965</page-number>responsibility.  In <em>People v. Brown </em>(1985) 40 Cal.3d 512, 540-544 [230 Cal.Rptr. 834, 726 P.2d 516] <em>(Brown), </em>reversed on another issue <em>sub nomine California v. Brown </em>(1987) 479 U.S. 538 [107 S.Ct. 837, 93 L.Ed.2d 934], we recognized that the \u201cunadorned\u201d phrase in former CALJIC No. 8.84.2 that the trier of fact \u201c <em>\u2019shall </em>impose a sentence of death\u2019 \u201d (italics added) if <em>it </em>\u201c \u2018concludes the aggravating circumstances outweigh the mitigating circumstances\u2019 \u201d could mislead the jury: \u201ca juror might understand his function as (i) merely the \u2018counting\u2019 of factors and then (ii) reaching an \u2018automatic\u2019 decision, with no exercise of personal responsibility for deciding, by his own standards, which penalty was appropriate. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(People v. Milner </em>(1988) 45 Cal.3d 227, 256 [246 Cal.Rptr. 713, 753 P.2d 669].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-5\">In cases tried before <em>Brown, </em>such as the case before us, we look to the entire record \u201cto determine whether, in context, the sentencer may have been misled to defendant\u2019s prejudice about the scope of its sentencing discretion . . . .\u201d <em>(Brown, supra, </em>40 Cal.3d at p. 544, fn. 17.) We are satisfied, on this record, that the jury understood its duty to carefully and properly weigh its decision. The prosecutor correctly pointed out to the jury that \u201cyou are commanded by the law to take these eleven factors and weigh and consider them, not in a mechanistic sense, but in a sense that gives true value and weight to each of the factors, as you, the jury, determine them to be.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-6\">Although defense counsel stated, in one instance, that \u201cif the aggravating factors outweigh the mitigating then you must sentence [defendant to death],\u201d his next statement was, \u201cAnd if you find to the contrary, then you will sentence him to life without the possibility of parole.\u201d He then argued that \u201cwhen you weigh [the mitigating factors] those factors will prevail.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-7\">The jury was also instructed that it was \u201cobliged to weigh mitigating evidence against aggravating evidence in exercising its sentencing discretion. Although the law seeks to ensure that this discretion is not weighed arbitrarily, i.e., without regard to the evidence, the weighing process is not mechanical.\u201d As we stated in <em>People </em>v. <em>Weaver </em>(2001) 26 Cal.4th 876, 985 [111 Cal.Rptr.2d 2, 29 P.3d 103]: \u2018\u201c[N]owhere did the prosecutor [or defense attorney] urge the jury to merely count the number of aggravating and mitigating factors and mechanically or arithmetically impose the death penalty.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d Because both the prosecutor and defense counsel here urged the jury to <em>weigh </em>the aggravating and mitigating factors, we find no <em>Brown </em>error under these facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-8\">C. <em>Emotional Disturbance as a Mitigating Factor</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1007-9\">Defendant claims that Penal Code section 190.3, factor (d), by asking the penalty jury to consider whether defendant acted under \u201cextreme <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"966\">*966</page-number>mental or emotional disturbance\u201d during the commission of the offense, unduly limited the kinds of evidence admissible at the penalty phase. This contention is without merit. We have repeatedly rejected challenges to the word \u201cextreme\u201d in section 190.3, factor (d). (See, e.g., <em>People v. Burgener </em>(2003) 29 Cal.4th 833, 885 [129 Cal.Rptr.2d 747, 62 P.3d 1] <em>(Burgener); People </em>v. <em>Roybal </em>(1998) 19 Cal.4th 481, 522-523 [79 Cal.Rptr.2d 487, 966 P.2d 521]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Jones </em>(1997) 15 Cal.4th 119, 190 [61 Cal.Rptr.2d 386, 931 P.2d 960]; <em>People v. Ray </em>(1996) 13 Cal.4th 313, 359 [52 Cal.Rptr.2d 296, 914 P.2d 846]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Ghent </em>(1987) 43 Cal.3d 739, 776 [239 Cal.Rptr. 82, 739 P.2d 1250].) Because Penal Code section 190.3, factor (k) of the 1978 death penalty law permitted the jury to look to \u201cany other circumstance which extenuates the gravity of the crime,\u201d it therefore allows consideration of any mental or emotional condition, even if it is not \u201cextreme.\u201d (Pe<em>ople v. Clark </em>(1992) 3 Cal.4th 41, 163 [10 Cal.Rptr.2d 554, 833 P.2d 561].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1008-5\">D. <em>Prosecutorial Misconduct During the Penalty Phase Argument</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1008-6\">Defendant contends that the prosecutor\u2019s penalty phase closing argument constituted misconduct because it improperly appealed to the jury\u2019s passions. Because there was no objection or request for admonishment, defendant is deemed to have forfeited the objection and the point cannot be raised on appeal. <em>(People v. Medina </em>(1995) 11 Cal.4th 694, 775-776 [47 Cal.Rptr.2d 165, 906 P.2d 2] <em>(Medina).)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1008-7\">In any event, this argument is without merit. The prosecutor made allusions to the fact that the three girls would never again \u201chear a bird sing,\u201d \u201csee a sunset,\u201d \u201ctaste an apple, a cup of coffee or a Coca Cola,\u201d \u201cwalk in the spring rain,\u201d \u201clearn that the world perhaps does have a place for each of them,\u201d \u201chold a hand,\u201d or put a \u201ckey in the door and have one say: Are you home?\u201d As we stated in <em>Haskett, supra, </em>30 Cal.3d at page 863, in which the prosecutor, in his penalty phase argument, invited the jurors to \u201cput themselves in the [victim\u2019s] shoes\u201d: \u201c[A]t the penalty phase the jury decides a question, the resolution of which turns not only on the facts, but on a jury\u2019s moral assessment of those facts as they reflect on whether the defendant should be put to death. It is not only appropriate, but necessary, that the jury weigh the sympathetic elements of defendant\u2019s background against those that may offend the conscience.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1008-8\">We followed <em>Haskett </em>in <em>Medina, supra, </em>11 Cal.4th at page <em>111, </em>in which the prosecutor, during the penalty phase, argued to the jury the terror the victim must have felt while lying on the ground awaiting execution. What we stated in <em>Medina </em>applies here as well: \u201c[T]he prosecutor\u2019s argument did not exceed the bounds of propriety.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 778.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"967\">*967</page-number>E. <em>Instruction That a Death Verdict Will Result in Death</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1009-5\">Defendant claims that it was error for the trial court, at the request of defense counsel, to instruct the jury that \u201c[i]f you find that a verdict of death is appropriate, you must assume that such penalty will be imposed,\u201d without giving a similar instruction regarding a sentence of life without the possibility of parole. This contention is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-6\">As we have explained in prior cases, because of the possibility of appellate reversal or gubernatorial commutation or pardon, it would be erroneous to instruct the jury that if it returns a death verdict, the sentence of death will inexorably be carried out. But the trial court may give such an instruction at the defendant\u2019s request. <em>(People v. Kipp </em>(1998) 18 Cal.4th 349, 378-379 [75 Cal.Rptr.2d 716, 956 P.2d 1169] [citing cases].) The trial court, therefore, did not err in instructing the jury, at defendant\u2019s request, to assume that a verdict of death would be carried out.</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-7\">We have also rejected the argument that the trial court is required to instruct the jury to assume that a verdict of life without the possibility of parole really does mean life without the possibility of parole. As we stated in <em>People </em>v. <em>Sanders </em>(1995) 11 Cal.4th 475, 562 [46 Cal.Rptr.2d 751, 905 P.2d 420]; \u201c \u2018When a term is commonly understood by those familiar with the English language and is not used in a technical sense peculiar to the law, the court is not required to give an instruction as to its meaning in the absence of a request. [Citation.] In this case, the term \u201cconfinement in the state prison for life without possibility of parole\u201d was used in the common and nontechnical sense that the plain meaning of the words convey. Accordingly, the court was not required to give an instruction as to its meaning sua sponte.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d In the present case, defendant did not request such an instruction, nor was the court required to give the same. This contention is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-8\">F. <em>Instruction on Lesser Included Offenses</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1009-9\">Defendant contends that CALJIC No. 17.10, the jury instruction that requires a unanimous acquittal of the charged offense prior to a verdict on a lesser offense, violated his due process and Eighth Amendment rights to a full jury consideration of lesser offenses. This precise issue has been repeatedly rejected by this court. (See, e.g., <em>People v. Dennis </em>(1998) 17 Cal.4th 468, 535-537 [71 Cal.Rptr.2d 680, 950 P.2d 1035]; <em>People v. Fields </em>(1996) 13 Cal.4th 289, 303-305 [52 Cal.Rptr.2d 282, 914 P.2d 832].) We see no reason to revisit the issue here.</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-10\">G. <em>Jury\u2019s Request</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1009-11\">During deliberations, the jury requested a copy of Dr. Edwards\u2019s report. This report was referred to in the testimony of Dr. Globus, a defense <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"968\">*968</page-number>psychologist. The trial court correctly informed the jury that, because the report was not in evidence, it was not available to the jury. The court volunteered that the jury could have the court reporter read back Dr. Globus\u2019s entire testimony, but not only the aspects that related to the report. The jury was given the night to reflect upon this situation. The next morning, the jury did not renew its request. Instead, it resumed deliberations and returned a death verdict later that day.</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-5\">We have interpreted Penal Code section 1138 to provide that \u201c \u2018the trial court must satisfy requests by the jury for rereading of testimony.\u2019 \u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Box </em>(2000) 23 Cal.4th 1153, 1213 [99 Cal.Rptr.2d 69, 5 P.3d 130], quoting <em>People v. Ainsworth </em>(1988) 45 Cal.3d 984, 1020 [248 Cal.Rptr. 568, 755 P.2d 1017].)<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> This statutory right is not of constitutional dimension, since \u201c[t]he rereading of testimony is not a critical stage of the proceedings.\u201d <em>(Ayala, supra, </em>23 Cal.4th at p. 288.) Because the jury here never made a request to have the testimony reread, there was no statutory violation. Instead, the jury requested a report that was not in evidence; the jury never thereafter responded to the court\u2019s suggestion that the entire testimony be read back.</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-6\">The suggestion by defendant that the trial court\u2019s decision not to permit the reading of portions of the testimony of a witness amounted to \u201cjury coercion\u201d is without merit. The trial court made it clear, prior to trial, that rereading a portion of a witness\u2019s testimony was not permitted because testimony could then be taken out of context. This decision was well within the sound discretion of the court. We recently rejected this very argument in <em>People v. Hillhouse </em>(2002) 27 Cal.4th 469, 506-507 [117 Cal.Rptr.2d 45, 40 P.3d 754]: \u201c[Defendant argues the court erred in advising the jury it would hear the entire testimony of any given witness. This portion of the instruction did not violate section 1138 [of the Penal Code]. That statute mandates the readback of testimony at jury request, but it does not forbid giving the jury more than it requests so it also receives the context. Defendant speculates the jury may have wanted a rereading of some part of [the witness\u2019s] testimony but chose not to request it because the entire testimony was lengthy. . . . But in any event, the court made clear it <em>would </em>provide any requested rereading of material testimony. Merely informing the jury of the time it may take for rehearing testimony is not impermissible jury coercion. [Citation.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-7\">Moreover, in the present case, the jury had had the entirety of Joanna\u2019s and Darlene\u2019s testimony reread, which entailed over two days of rereading. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"969\">*969</page-number>This jury, therefore, was quite capable of requesting extensive readback. It did not. <em>People </em>v. <em>Warren </em>(1900) 130 Cal. 678, 681-682 [63 P. 87], and <em>People v. Slaughter </em>(1917) 33 Cal.App. 365, 378-379 [165 P. 44], are on point. In each case, the trial court informed the jury that the requested readback would take hours; thereafter each jury reached a verdict without hearing the requested readback. Our court and the Court of Appeal found no violation of Penal Code section 1138. Based on the foregoing authority, we similarly find no error here.</p>\n<p id=\"b1011-5\">H. <em>Description of an Execution</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1011-6\">Defendant claims that it was error for the trial court to prohibit the introduction of evidence describing how the death penalty is administered. This contention is without merit. We have consistently held that evidence of the manner in which the death penalty is carried out is irrelevant to our capital sentencing scheme. (See, e.g., <em>People </em>v. <em>Lucas </em>(1995) 12 Cal.4th 415, 499 [48 Cal.Rptr.2d 525, 907 P.2d 373]; <em>People v.

Daniels </em>(1991) 52 Cal.3d 815, 877-878 [277 Cal.Rptr. 122, 802 P.2d 906].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1011-7\">I. <em>Constitutional Challenges to California\u2019s 1978 Death Penalty Law</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1011-8\">In <em>People </em>v. <em>Snow </em>(2003) 30 Cal.4th 43 [132 Cal.Rptr.2d 271, 65 P.3d 749] <em>(Snow), </em>we again upheld the constitutionality of the 1978 death penalty scheme. And as we said in <em>People v. Clair </em>(1992) 2 Cal.4th 629, 691 [7 Cal.Rptr.2d 564, 828 P.2d 705] <em>(Clair): </em>\u201c \u2018Having time and again considered [such] claims ... in a series of decisions beginning with <em>People v. Rodriguez </em>(1986) 42 Cal.3d 730, 777-779 [230 Cal.Rptr. 667, 726 P.2d 113], we may summarize the views expressed therein thus: as a general matter at least, the 1978 death penalty law is facially valid under the federal and state charters. . . . [Defendant raises certain specific constitutional challenges. But he recognizes that in the <em>Rodriguez </em>series of cases, we have rejected each and every one.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d We now turn to each of the challenges.</p>\n<p id=\"b1011-9\">1. <em>Proportionality of Defendant\u2019s Sentence</em></p>\n<p id=\"Aen\">a. <em>Disproportionality</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1011-10\">Defendant claims that the application of the death penalty in his case is disproportionate to his personal culpability and is therefore cruel or unusual punishment, in violation of article I, section 17 of the California Constitution.  To determine whether a sentence is cruel or unusual as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"970\">*970</page-number>applied to a particular defendant, a reviewing court must examine the circumstances of the offense, including the defendant\u2019s motive, the extent of the defendant\u2019s involvement in the crime, the manner in which the crime was committed, and the consequences of the defendant\u2019s acts. The court must also consider the defendant\u2019s age, prior criminality and mental capabilities. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Hines </em>(1997) 15 Cal.4th 997, 1078 [64 Cal.Rptr.2d 594, 938 P.2d 388].) If the court concludes that the penalty imposed is \u201cgrossly disproportionate to the defendant\u2019s culpability\u201d <em>(People v. Dillon </em>(1983) 34 Cal.3d 441, 479 [194 Cal.Rptr. 390, 668 P.2d 697]) or, stated another way, that the punishment shocks the conscience and offends fundamental notions of human dignity (see, e.g., <em>People v. Cox </em>(1991) 53 Cal.3d 618, 690 [280 Cal.Rptr. 692, 809 P.2d 351]), the court must invalidate the sentence as unconstitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b1012-5\">Applying these principles, the imposition of the death penalty on defendant is neither cruel nor unusual. Defendant, with premeditation and deliberation, brutally murdered three teenage girls, on three separate occasions, and left their unclothed bodies in the woods. Never has defendant expressed remorse for the murders. While defendant may have suffered abuse as a child and at times drank too much, there is no evidence to suggest that these three cold-blooded murders were committed under any emotional disturbance. Given these facts alone, defendant\u2019s sentence is not disproportionate to his personal culpability.</p>\n<p id=\"b1012-6\">b. <em>Comparative Proportionality Review</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1012-7\">Comparative proportionality review, which requires a comparative or intercase proportionality review of other murder cases to determine the defendant\u2019s relative culpability, is not required by the United States Constitution. (Pu<em>lley v. Harris </em>(1984) 465 U.S. 37, 50-51 [104 S.Ct. 871, 879-880, 79 L.Ed.2d 29].) We have repeatedly rejected such a challenge. (See, e.g., <em>Burgener, supra, </em>29 Cal.4th at p. 884, fn. 7; <em>People </em>v. <em>Ochoa </em>(2001) 26 Cal.4th 398, 458 [110 Cal.Rptr.2d 324, 28 P.3d 78]; <em>People v.

We have also rejected the claim advanced by defendant that equal protection requires us to provide capital defendants with the same sentence review afforded other felons under the determinate sentencing law. (Pen. Code, \u00a7 1170, subd. (f); see, e.g., <em>People v. Lewis </em>(2001) 26 Cal.4th 334, 395 [110 Cal.Rptr.2d 272, 28 P.3d 34]; <em>People v.

We have rejected this claim in numerous decisions and decline to conclude differently here. (See, e.g., <em>Burgener, supra, 29 </em>Cal.4th at pp. 884-885; <em>People </em>v. <em>Hughes </em>(2002) 27 Cal.4th 287, 404 [116 Cal.Rptr.2d 401, 39 P.3d 432]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Bolin </em>(1998) 18 Cal.4th 297, 345 [75 Cal.Rptr.2d 412, 956 P.2d 374]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Barnett </em>(1998) 17 Cal.4th 1044, 1179 [74 Cal.Rptr.2d 121, 954 P.2d 384], and cases cited; <em>People </em>v. <em>Scott </em>(1997) 15 Cal.4th 1188, 1228 [65 Cal.Rptr.2d 240, 939 P.2d 354].) Defendant also asserts that the prosecutorial discretion permitted under our statutes renders California\u2019s death eligibility process unconstitutional. Again, we have rejected this claim in numerous decisions and decline to reconsider them now. (See, e.g., <em>Hughes, supra, </em>27 Cal.4th at p. 404; <em>Bolin, supra, </em>18 Cal.4th at p. 345; <em>Barnett, supra, </em>17 Cal.4th at p. 1179, and cases cited; <em>Scott, supra, </em>15 Cal.4th at p. 1228.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-6\">3. <em>Aggravating Circumstances</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1013-7\">Defendant claims that it is unconstitutional to impose a sentence of death unless the aggravating circumstances outweigh the mitigating circumstances beyond a reasonable doubt. This claim was first rejected by our court in <em>People </em>v. <em>Rodriguez, supra, </em>42 Cal.3d at pages 777-779, and has been rejected ever since. (See, e.g., <em>Snow, supra, </em>30 Cal.4th at pp. 125-127; <em>Burgener, supra, 29 </em>Cal.4th at p. 884, fn. 7; <em>People </em>v. <em>Gutierrez </em>(2002) 28 Cal.4th 1083, 1150-1151 [124 Cal.Rptr.2d 373, 52 P.3d 572]; <em>Clair, supra, 2 </em>Cal.4th at p. 691.)  As we recently stated: \u201cThe Constitution does not require the jury to find beyond a reasonable doubt that a particular factor in aggravation exists, that the aggravating factors outweighed the mitigating factors, or that death was the appropriate penalty.\u201d <em>(Burgener, supra, 29 </em>Cal.4th at p. 884.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-8\">Defendant, however, asks us to reconsider this position in light of two recent United States Supreme Court cases, <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey </em>(2000) 530 U.S. 466 [120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435], and <em>Ring v. Arizona </em>(2002) 536 U.S. 584 [122 S.Ct. 2428, 153 L.Ed.2d 556]. Specifically, defendant argues that the two cases read together mandate that the aggravating circumstances necessary for the jury\u2019s imposition of the death penalty be found beyond a reasonable doubt. We disagree. As this court recently stated in <em>Snow, supra, </em>30 Cal.4th at page 126, footnote 32: \u201cWe reject that argument for the reason given in <em>People v. Anderson </em>[(2001)] 25 Cal.4th [543,] 589-590, footnote 14 [106 Cal.Rptr.2d 575, 22 P.3d 347]: \u2018[U]nder the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"972\">*972</page-number>California death penalty scheme, once the defendant has been convicted of first degree murder and one or more special circumstances has been found true beyond a reasonable doubt, death <em>is </em>no more than the prescribed statutory maximum for the offense; the only alternative is life imprisonment without possibility of parole. (\u00a7 190.2, subd. (a).) Hence, facts which bear upon, but do not necessarily determine, which of these two alternative penalties is. appropriate do not come within the holding of <em>ApprendV </em>The high court\u2019s recent decision in <em>Ring v. Arizona </em>[, <em>supra,] </em>536 U.S. 584 [122 S.Ct. 2428] does not change this analysis. Under the Arizona capital sentencing scheme invalidated in <em>Ring, </em>a defendant convicted of first degree murder could be sentenced to death if, and only if, the trial court first found at least one of the enumerated aggravating factors true. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 603 [122 S.Ct. at p. 2440].) Under California\u2019s scheme, in contrast, each juror must believe the circumstances in aggravation substantially outweigh those in mitigation, but the jury as a whole need not find any one aggravating factor to exist. The final step in California capital sentencing is a free weighing of all the factors relating to the defendant\u2019s culpability, comparable to a sentencing court\u2019s traditionally discretionary decision to, for example, impose one prison sentence rather than another. Nothing in <em>Apprendi </em>or <em>Ring </em>suggests the sentencer in such a system constitutionally must find any aggravating factor true beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d (Accord, <em>People </em>v. <em>Smith </em>(2003) 30 Cal.4th 581, 642 [134 Cal.Rptr.2d 1, 68 P.3d 302]; <em>People v. Prieto </em>(2003) 30 Cal.4th 226, 275 [133 Cal.Rptr.2d 18, 66 P.3d 1123].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-5\">J. <em>Automatic Motion for Modification of Death Verdict</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1014-6\">Under Penal Code section 190.4, subdivision (e), the trial court is required to \u201creview the evidence, consider, take into account, and be guided by the aggravating and mitigating circumstances referred to in Section 190.3, and shall make a determination as to whether the jury\u2019s findings and verdicts that the aggravating circumstances outweigh the mitigating circumstances are contrary to law or the evidence presented. The judge shall state on the record the reason for his findings.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-7\">Defendant claims a remand is required because it was error for the judge to (1) consider that defendant possessed firearms under Penal Code section 190.3, factor (a); (2) consider that defendant possessed knives and guns under section 190.3, factor (b); (3) double-count the crimes of which he was convicted under section 190.3, factors (a) and (b); (4) not consider defendant\u2019s brain damage under section 190.3, factors (d) and (h); and (5) not consider other mitigating factors under section 190.3, factor (k). We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-8\">Upon this record, it is clear the judge took this review seriously and painstakingly went through each of the aggravating and mitigating factors. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"973\">*973</page-number>He concluded that \u201cthe jury\u2019s findings and verdicts are not only supported by the weight of the evidence, but the court in its independent review of all the evidence\u201d found that \u201cthe aggravating circumstances overwhelmingly outweigh the mitigating factors.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1015-5\">As to defendant\u2019s specific claims of error, because it was proper to admit evidence that defendant possessed guns and knives, it was not error for the trial court to consider this evidence. As to the court\u2019s lack of discussion regarding brain damage, the trial court properly could have accepted the testimony of the neuropsychologist, Dr. Vogt, that there was no evidence of brain damage.</p>\n<p id=\"b1015-6\">In <em>People v. Miranda </em>(1987) 44 Cal.3d 57, 105-106 [241 Cal.Rptr. 594, 744 P.2d 1127], we held that the criminal activity to be considered under Penal Code section 190.3, factor (b) does not include the circumstances of the crime for which the defendant is being prosecuted in the current proceeding. Here, the court correctly considered the circumstances of the current crime as a factor under section 190.3, factor (a) but incorrectly used these same circumstances as an aggravating factor under section 190.3, factor (b). The court also incorrectly stated that the mere possession of guns constituted a crime of violence. The court\u2019s two errors were harmless. Given the willful, premeditated, deliberate murder of the three teenage girls, it is not reasonably possible that such errors affected the trial court\u2019s decision to deny the automatic motion to modify the verdict. (See, e.g., <em>Williams, supra, </em>16 Cal.4th at p. 283; <em>People </em>v. <em>Clark, supra, </em>3 Cal.4th at pp. 171-172.) No basis for a remand appears.</p>\n<p id=\"b1015-7\">V.
