(See <em>Harris v. McRae </em>(1980) 448 U.S. 297, 308 [100 S.Ct. 2671, 2683, 65 L.Ed.2d 784].) The California Medical Assistance Program, Medical (Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 14000-14198),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> \u201crepresents California\u2019s implementation of the federal Medicaid program . . . .\u201d <em>(Robert F. Kennedy Medical Center v. Belsh\u00e9 </em>(1996) 13 Cal.4th 748, 751 [55 Cal.Rptr.2d 107, 919 P.2d 721].) In implementing Medi-Cal, our Legislature has enacted statutes authorizing a health care provider to assert and collect on a lien for the full cost of its services against \u201cany judgment, award, or settlement obtained by\u201d a Medicaid beneficiary. (\u00a7 14124.791; see also \u00a7 14124.74.)</p>\n<p id=\"b847-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"805\">*805</page-number>The Legislature enacted these statutes to alleviate the fiscal difficulties faced by health care providers who, due to Medi-Cal payment limits, did not receive full compensation for services rendered to Medicaid beneficiaries (see Legis. Counsel\u2019s Dig., Assem. Bill No. 812 (1985-1986 Reg. Sess.) 4 Stats. 1985, Summary Dig., p. 241), and to give these providers an incentive \u201cto seek out third-party liability sources\u201d (Assem. Health Com., Rep. on Assem. Bill No. 812 (1985-1986 Reg. Sess.) Apr. 30, 1985, p. 2). As originally enacted in 1985, section 14124.791 allowed a provider to first bill Medi-Cal and, after receiving payment from Medi-Cal, \u201cto file a lien for the amount of unpaid charges against any judgment, award, or settlement obtained by the beneficiary . . . .\u201d (Stats. 1985, ch. 776, \u00a7 5, p. 2515.) Recognizing that this balance billing<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> provision might conflict with federal law, however, the Legislature provided that \u201c[t]he provisions for which appropriate federal waivers cannot be obtained [such as section 14124.791] shall not be implemented.\u201d (Stats. 1985, ch. 776, \u00a7 6, p. 2515.)</p>\n<p id=\"b847-5\">Because no federal waivers were obtained, the 1985 version of section 14124.791 was never implemented. (See Assem. Ways &amp; Means Com., Republican analysis of Sen. Bill. No. 1719 (1991-1992 Reg. Sess.) Aug. 31, 1992, p. 1.) In 1992, the Legislature sought to rectify this problem by revising section 14124.791. Under the 1992 version, a provider could recover on a lien \u201cagainst any judgment, award, or settlement obtained by the [Medicaid] beneficiary\u201d for the full cost of its services <em>only after </em>refunding the Medi-Cal payment. (\u00a7 14124.791.) Thus, the 1992 version permitted substitute billing\u2014where the provider substitutes recovery from a judgment or settlement obtained by the beneficiary for recovery from Medi-Cal\u2014and not balance billing. Unlike in 1985, the Legislature did not condition implementation of the 1992 version on the receipt of appropriate federal waivers.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-6\">Today we consider the constitutionality of the 1992 version of the provider lien statute in the context of a lawsuit filed by a Medi-Cal beneficiary against her medical provider. In this case, the health care provider filed a lien pursuant to section 14124.791 against the Medi-Cal beneficiary. Challenging the legality of the provider\u2019s practice of filing such liens, the beneficiary filed a class action lawsuit against the provider, alleging unfair competition and various tort claims. As the basis for her claims, the beneficiary contended federal law preempted section 14124.791 and rendered invalid any liens filed pursuant to that section. The trial court dismissed the action, holding that federal Medicaid law did not preempt section 14124.791. We now conclude that the trial court erred in part because federal law does preempt California\u2019s provider lien statutes. Nonetheless, we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"806\">*806</page-number>affirm the judgment of the trial court dismissing the class action with prejudice because the claims either fall within the safe harbor described in <em>Cel-Tech Communications, Inc. v. Los Angeles Cellular Telephone Co. </em>(1999) 20 Cal.4th 163, 182 [83 Cal.Rptr.2d 548, 973 P.2d 527] <em>(Cel-Tech), </em>or are barred by the litigation privilege contained in Civil Code section 47, subdivision (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b848-4\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b848-5\">Because we review this case after the trial court sustained a general demurrer, we accept as true all material allegations of the complaint. (See <em>Charles J. Vacanti, M.D., Inc. </em>v. <em>State Comp. Ins. Fund </em>(2001) 24 Cal.4th 800, 807 [102 Cal.Rptr.2d 562, 14 P.3d 234].) The complaint alleges the following facts:</p>\n<p id=\"b848-6\">Cimarron Olszewski (plaintiff) is a minor and a Medi-Cal beneficiary who received emergency medical care from Scripps Health (defendant), a medical care provider that participates in the Medi-Cal program. Defendant received and accepted Medi-Cal payments for the medical care it provided to plaintiff. Defendant, either directly or through its collection agent, Medical Liabilities Recoveries, Inc. (MLR) (collectively defendants),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> also asserted a lien against \u201cthe personal injury claims, judgments or settlements of\u2019 plaintiff pursuant to Welfare and Institutions Code section 14124.791 and Civil Code section 3045.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-7\">In response, plaintiff filed this class action, alleging that defendants had no legal right to assert and collect on such liens in light of federal Medicaid law governing provider reimbursement and third party liability. Plaintiff asserted causes of action for (1) violations of the unfair competition law (hereafter UCL; Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7 17200 et seq.), (2) trespass to chattels, (3) negligent misrepresentation, and (4) fraud. In addition to restitution and damages, plaintiff sought an order declaring that the liens asserted by defendants against her and the other class members were \u201cunlawful, unenforceable, and uncollectible\u201d because federal law preempted the California statutes authorizing these liens. Plaintiff also sought to enjoin defendants from asserting these liens in the future.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-8\">Defendants demurred, and the trial court sustained the demurrers without leave to amend. The court concluded that defendants had a statutory right to assert the liens under section 14124.791 and that federal law did not preempt this statutory right. The court also held that plaintiffs tort claims were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"807\">*807</page-number>barred because the filing of the liens was \u201ca privileged communication protected by Civil Code [section] 47[, subdivision] (b)(2).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b849-5\">The Court of Appeal disagreed with the trial court on the preemption issue and concluded that federal Medicaid law preempted section 14124.791. The court, however, agreed that plaintiffs claims were barred because (1) section 14124.791 provided a safe harbor from plaintiffs UCL claim under <em>Cel-Tech, supra, </em>20 Cal.4th at page 182; and (2) defendants\u2019 assertion of the liens was protected by the litigation privilege. In determining the proper disposition, the court concluded that the trial court had found an \u201cimbedded claim for declaratory relief as to the validity of section 14124.791\u201d and had \u201cdeclared section 14124.791 was not preempted by federal law\u201d and defendants\u2019 lien against plaintiff was valid. The Court of Appeal then modified the declaratory relief portion of the trial court\u2019s judgment to reflect its findings that federal law preempted section 14124.791 and defendants\u2019 lien was invalid and unenforceable and affirmed the judgment \u201cas so modified.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b849-6\">Both plaintiff and defendants petitioned this court and we granted review.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-7\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b849-8\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b849-9\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b849-10\">As an initial matter, we find that the Court of Appeal acted properly in modifying the judgment to include a declaration that defendants\u2019 lien against plaintiff was invalid, but erred in adding a declaration that federal law preempted section 14124.791. In her complaint, plaintiff adequately pled a claim for declaratory relief under Code of Civil Procedure section 1060 even though she did not separately identify such a cause of action. <em>(Bank of America etc. Assn. </em>v. <em>Gillett </em>(1940) 36 Cal.App.2d 453, 455 [97 P.2d 875] [affirming a judgment awarding declaratory relief even though the plaintiff failed to \u201cdesignate^ his complaint one for \u2018Declaratory Relief \u201d]; see also 5 Witkin, Cal. Procedure (4th ed. 1997) Pleading, \u00a7 810, p. 265 [\u201cbecause there are no forms of action, a declaration of rights will be upheld if the complaint states sufficient facts even though the pleader did not think he was proceeding under C.C.P. 1060 and did not appropriately label his complaint\u201d].) The complaint asked the court to adjudge the rights and duties of plaintiff and defendants with respect to defendants\u2019 lien and alleged facts establishing an \u201cactual controversy\u201d appropriate for declaratory relief. <em>(Wellenkamp </em>v. <em>Bank of America </em>(1978) 21 Cal.3d 943, 947 [148 Cal.Rptr. 379, 582 P.2d 970].) As such, plaintiff was entitled to a declaration of her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"808\">*808</page-number>rights and duties under defendants\u2019 lien. (See Gillett, at p. 455.) And, upon concluding that defendants\u2019 lien against plaintiff was invalid and unenforceable, the Court of Appeal properly modified the judgment to include a declaration to that effect. (See <em>Essick v. City of Los Angeles </em>(1950) 34 Cal.2d 614, 624-625 [213 P.2d 492] [modifying a judgment to include declaratory relief even though the trial court dismissed the complaint without specifically awarding declaratory relief].)</p>\n<p id=\"b850-4\">The Court of Appeal, however, erred by modifying the judgment to include a declaration addressing the constitutionality of section 14124.791. In her complaint, plaintiff never sought a declaration that federal law preempted section 14124.791; she only sought a declaration that defendants\u2019 liens were invalid. Thus, in modifying the judgment, the court should have only included a declaration that defendants\u2019 lien against plaintiff was invalid, unenforceable, and uncollectible\u2014and not that section 14124.791 was preempted.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-5\">Nonetheless, the Court of Appeal did not exceed its jurisdiction by deciding the preemption issue. In a convoluted argument, defendant contends the court\u2019s erroneous resolution of the \u201cimbedded\u201d declaratory relief claim somehow invalidated its finding of preemption because defendant had no opportunity to litigate the claim. Defendant is mistaken. In determining whether defendants\u2019 lien was invalid, the Court of Appeal had to determine whether federal law preempted California\u2019s provider lien statutes. Moreover, the trial court, in sustaining the demurrers, expressly held that federal law did not preempt section 14124.791. Thus, the Court of Appeal properly considered and decided the preemption issue in reviewing the trial court\u2019s order sustaining the demurrers. In any event, defendant fully briefed the preemption issue before the Court of Appeal and the trial court. Under these circumstances, defendant can hardly claim that it lacked an adequate opportunity to litigate the preemption issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b850-7\">Similarly, defendant\u2019s contention that the Court of Appeal erred by deciding the federal preemption issue without making the State of California a party to this action must be rejected. Code of Civil Procedure section 389, subdivision (a) states in relevant part that \u201c[a] person who is subject to service of process and whose joinder will not deprive the court of jurisdiction over the subject matter of the action shall be joined as a party in the action if. . .in his absence complete relief cannot be accorded among those already parties . . . .\u201d Thus, \u201c[a] person is an indispensable party [only] when the judgment to be rendered necessarily must affect his rights.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"809\">*809</page-number><em>(Hartman Ranch Co. v. Associated Oil Co. </em>(1937) 10 Cal.2d 232, 262 [73 P.2d 1163].) In this case, the court could grant the relief requested by plaintiff without injuring or affecting the rights of the State of California. Plaintiff did not assert an imbedded claim for declaratory relief seeking to invalidate section 14124.791. (See <em>ante, </em>at p. 808.) Rather, she sought to invalidate the liens filed by defendants pursuant to that section.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The State of California had no interest in these liens and could not recover on them. The fact that an adverse ruling against defendants may have a financial impact on the state or require a finding that federal law preempts a California statute does not make the state an indispensable party. (See <em>Hartenstine v. Superior Court </em>(1987) 196 Cal.App.3d 206, 222 [241 Cal.Rptr. 756] [finding that the State of California was not an indispensable party despite its \u201cinterest in enforcing its laws\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b851-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b851-6\">We now consider defendant\u2019s substantive challenge to the Court of Appeal\u2019s declaration that defendants\u2019 lien against plaintiff filed pursuant to section 14124.791 was invalid, unenforceable, and uncollectible. Plaintiff concedes that California law permits provider liens against \u201cthe personal injury claims, judgments or settlements\u201d of Medicaid beneficiaries. She, however, contends these liens, such as the liens filed by defendants, are unenforceable because federal law preempts the statutes authorizing these liens. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-7\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b851-8\">We begin with a brief overview of Medicaid and Medi-Cal. In 1965, Congress established Medicaid by enacting title XIX of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1396-1396v; see <em>Schweiker </em>v. <em>Gray Panthers </em>(1981) 453 U.S. 34, 36 [101 S.Ct. 2633, 2636, 69 L.Ed.2d460] <em>(Schweiker)). </em>\u201cThe Medicaid program . . . is a cooperative endeavor in which the Federal Government provides financial assistance to participating States to aid them in furnishing health care to needy persons. Under this system of \u2018cooperative federalism,\u2019 [citation] if a State agrees to establish a Medicaid plan . . . the Federal Government agrees to pay a specified percentage of \u2018the total amount expended ... as medical assistance under the State plan. . . .\u2019\u201d <em>(Harris </em>v. <em>McRae, supra, </em>448 U.S. at p. 308 [100 S.Ct. at p. 2683].) Participation is voluntary, but \u201conce a State elects to participate, it must comply with the requirements of Title XIX.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 301 [100 S.Ct. at p. 2680].)</p>\n<p id=\"b851-9\">Although the requirements of title XIX are described in detail in 42 United States Code section 1396a (see <em>Pennsylvania Medical Society v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"810\">*810</page-number><em>Snider </em>(3d Cir. 1994) 29 F.3d 886, 889 <em>(Snider)), </em>construing these requirements is often easier said than done. \u201cThe Social Security Act is among the most intricate ever drafted by Congress. Its Byzantine construction . . . makes the Act \u2018almost unintelligible to the uninitiated.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Schweiker, supra, </em>453 U.S. at p. 43 [100 S.Ct. at p. 2640].) Indeed, a federal judge once described the Medicaid statutes as \u201can aggravated assault on the English language, resistant to attempts to understand it.\u201d <em>(Friedman v. Berger </em>(S.D.N.Y. 1976) 409 F.Supp. 1225, 1226, affd. (2d Cir. 1976) 547 F.2d 724.) Because of the extraordinary complexity of these statutes, Congress has \u201cconferred on the Secretary [of Health and Human Services (hereafter Secretary)] exceptionally broad authority to prescribe standards for applying certain sections of the Act.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>(Schweiker, </em>at p. 43 [100 S.Ct. at p. 2640]; see, e.g., 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396a(a)(4)(A) [\u201c[a] State plan for medical assistance must \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 [ID \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 til \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 provide . . . such methods of administration ... as are found by the Secretary to be necessary for the proper and efficient operation of the plan\u201d].) Regulations promulgated by the Secretary are therefore \u201centitled to \u2018legislative effect\u2019 \u201d unless they exceed his' or her statutory authority or are arbitrary or capricious. <em>(Schweiker, </em>at p. 44 [100 S.Ct. at p. 2640].) \u201cState Medicaid plans must [therefore] comply with requirements imposed both by the [Social Security] Act itself and by the Secretary\u201d <em>(id. </em>at p. 37 [100 S.Ct. at p. 2636]), and must \u201cbe approved by the Secretary\u201d <em>(Elizabeth Blackwell Health Center v. Knoll </em>(3d Cir. 1995) 61 F.3d 170, 172 <em>(Elizabeth Blackwell Center)).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b852-4\">Despite these requirements, \u201c[t]he [Medicaid] program was designed to provide the states with a degree of flexibility in designing plans that meet their individual needs. [Citation.] As such, states are given considerable latitude in formulating the terms of their own medical assistance plans.\u201d <em>(Addis v. Whitburn </em>(7th Cir. 1998) 153 F.3d 836, 840.) \u201cCongress intended that states be allowed flexibility in developing procedures for administering their statutory obligations under the Medicaid statute and their state plans.\u201d <em>(Elizabeth Blackwell Center, supra, </em>61 F.3d at p. 178.)</p>\n<p id=\"b852-5\">With this backdrop in mind, we now turn to the Medicaid statutes and regulations governing provider reimbursement and third party liability. A state Medicaid plan must \u201cestablish a scheme for reimbursing health care providers for the medical services provided to needy individuals, and must require that payment for Medicaid services be made only to the provider of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"811\">*811</page-number>the services or, under certain conditions, to the recipient of the services.\u201d <em>(Banks </em>v. <em>Secretary of Indiana Family &amp; Soc. Serv. </em>(7th Cir. 1993) 997 F.2d 231, 235; see also 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396a(a)(13); 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 447.10 (2002).)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The plan and the state agency administering that plan must ensure that the rate is \u201creasonable and adequate to meet the costs that must be incurred by efficiently and economically operated facilities to provide services in conformity with State and Federal laws, regulations, and quality and safety standards.\u201d (42 C.F.R. \u00a7 447.250(a).) To receive reimbursement from a state Medicaid plan, a health care provider must enter into a provider agreement with the state Medicaid agency. (See 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396a(a)(27).)</p>\n<p id=\"b853-5\">Because \u201cMedicaid is essentially a payer of last resort\u201d <em>(Rehabilitation Ass\u2019n of Va. v. Kozlowski </em>(4th Cir. 1994) 42 F.3d 1444, 1447), federal Medicaid law requires state plans to recover from liable third parties whenever possible. A \u201c <em>\u2018[t]hird </em>party\u2019 \u201d is \u201cany individual, entity or program that is or may be liable to pay all or part of the expenditures for medical assistance furnished under a State plan.\u201d (42 C.F.R. \u00a7 433.136, italics added.) The state Medicaid agency must \u201ctake all reasonable measures to ascertain the legal liability of third parties . . . .\u201d (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396a(a)(25)(A).) \u201c[I]n any case where such a legal liability is found to exist after medical assistance has been made available on behalf of the individual and where the amount of reimbursement the State can reasonably expect to recover exceeds the costs of such recovery, the State or local agency [must] seek reimbursement for such assistance to the extent of such legal liability . . . .\u201d (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396a(a)(25)(B).) To that end, the state plan must provide for the mandatory assignment of the beneficiary\u2019s rights \u201cto payment for medical care from any third party\u201d to the state agency. (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396k(a)(l)(A); see also 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396a(a)(45); 42 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 433.145, 433.146.)</p>\n<p id=\"b853-6\">Thus, when a health care provider submits a Medicaid claim, the state Medicaid agency must first ascertain whether a third party may be liable. \u201cIf the agency has established the probable existence of third party liability at the time the claim is filed, the agency must reject the claim and return it to the provider for a determination of the amount of liability .... When the amount of liability is determined, the agency must then pay the claim to the extent that payment allowed under the agency\u2019s payment schedule exceeds the amount of the third party\u2019s payment.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> (42 C.F.R. \u00a7 433.139(b)(1).) \u201cIf the probable existence of third party liability cannot be established or third party benefits are not available to pay the recipient\u2019s medical expenses at the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"812\">*812</page-number>time the claim is filed, the agency must pay the full amount allowed under the agency\u2019s payment schedule.\u201d (42 C.F.R. \u00a7 433.139(c).) The agency must then pursue \u201crecovery of reimbursement\u201d from that third party.

In applying this assumption, courts should narrowly interpret the scope of Congress\u2019s \u201cintended invalidation of state law\u201d whenever possible. <em>(Medtronic, Inc. </em>v. <em>Lohr </em>(1996) 518 U.S. 470, 485 [116 S.Ct. 2240, 2250, 135 L.Ed.2d 700] <em>(Medtronic), </em>see also <em>Cipollone, supra, </em>505 U.S. at p. 518 [112 S.Ct. at p. 2618] [holding that the presumption against preemption \u201creinforces the appropriateness of a narrow reading of\u2019 the federal statute\u2019s preemptive effect].)</p>\n<p id=\"b857-7\">In this case, the California statutes at issue address a subject traditionally regulated by the states\u2014public health and the costs of medical care. (See <em>New York State Conference of Blue Cross &amp; Blue Shield Plans </em>v. <em>Travelers Ins. Co. </em>(1995) 514 U.S. 645, 661 [115 S.Ct. 1671, 1679-1680, 131 L.Ed.2d 695]; <em>Downhour v.

This is true <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"816\">*816</page-number>even though California enacted these statutes as part of its implementation of the federal Medicaid program. Contrary to plaintiffs assertion, Medicaid is not a \u201cfield\u201d traditionally legislated by Congress. Rather, by enacting the Medicaid statutes, Congress legislated in the field of public health\u2014a field traditionally regulated by the states. (See <em>ibid.) </em>The presumption against preemption therefore applies. <em>(Rice v. Santa Fe Elevator Corp., supra, </em>330 U.S. at p. 230 [67 S.Ct. at p. 1152].)</p>\n<p id=\"b858-4\">Indeed, the very nature of the Medicaid program triggers a presumption against preemption. The Medicaid program is \u201cbased on a scheme of cooperative federalism.\u201d <em>(King v. Smith </em>(1968) 392 U.S. 309, 316 [88 S.Ct. 2128, 2133, 20 L.Ed.2d 1118].) Under this scheme, a participating state creates and administers its own plan which must be approved by the Secretary. (See <em>Elizabeth Blackwell Center, supra, </em>61 F.3d at pp. 172, 178.) Thus, the participating state works in tandem with the federal government in pursuit of a common purpose\u2014the provision of medical care to the needy. \u201cWhere[, as here,] coordinate state and federal efforts exist within a complementary administrative framework, and in the pursuit of common purposes, the case for federal pre-emption becomes a less persuasive one.\u201d <em>(New York Dept. of Social Services v. Dublino </em>(1973) 413 U.S. 405, 421 [93 S.Ct. 2507, 2517, 37 L.Ed.2d 688].)</p>\n<p id=\"b858-5\">With these standards in mind, we now consider plaintiffs contention that federal Medicaid law actually conflicts with and therefore preempts California\u2019s provider lien statutes..</p>\n<p id=\"b858-6\">When determining the preemptive effect of federal law, we are guided by the United States Supreme Court\u2019s \u201coft-repeated comment . . . that \u2018 [t]he purpose of Congress is the ultimate touchstone\u2019 in every preemption case.\u201d <em>(Medtronic, supra, </em>518 U.S. at p. 485 [116 S.Ct. at p. 2250], quoting <em>Retail Clerks v. Schermerhorn </em>(1963) 375 U.S. 96, 103 [84 S.Ct. 219, 222, 11 L.Ed.2d 179].) \u201cCongress\u2019 intent, of course, primarily is discerned from the language of the pre-emption statute and the \u2018statutory framework\u2019 surrounding it.\u201d <em>(Medtronic, </em>at p. 486 [116 S.Ct. at pp. 2250-2251], quoting <em>G\u00e1de v. National Solid Wastes Management Assn. </em>(1992) 505 U.S. 88, 111 [112 S.Ct. 2374, 2390, 120 L.Ed.2d 73].) \u201cAlso relevant, however, is the \u2018structure and purpose of the statute as a whole,\u2019 [citation] as revealed not only in the text, but through the reviewing court\u2019s reasoned understanding of the way in which Congress intended the statute and its surrounding regulatory scheme to affect business, consumers, and the law.\u201d <em>(Medtronic, </em>at p. 486 [116 S.Ct. at p. 2251], quoting <em>Gade, </em>at p. 98 [112 S.Ct. at p. 2383].)</p>\n<p id=\"b859-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"817\">*817</page-number>Where, as here, Congress enacted the preemption statute pursuant to its spending power, Congress must \u201cspeak with a clear voice . . . <em>(Pennhurst State School v.

Thus, in exercising its spending power, Congress must unambiguously state that it is imposing an obligation and clearly define the scope of that obligation. In light of this need for congressional clarity and the presumption against preemption, any ambiguity in the Medicaid statutes and regulations must be construed against preemption.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-6\">We therefore begin by reviewing the history and language of the relevant federal statutes and regulations. (See <em>Medtronic, supra, </em>518 U.S. at p. 486 [116 S.Ct. at pp. 2250-2251].) In creating Medicaid, Congress sought \u201cto provide medical assistance to persons whose income and resources are insufficient to meet the costs of necessary care and services.\u201d <em>(Atkins v. Rivera </em>(1986) <em>477 </em>U.S. 154, 156 [106 S.Ct. 2456, 2458, 91 L.Ed.2d 131].) Congress also intended \u201c[t]he program ... to be the payor of last resort; that is, other available third party resources must be used before the Medicaid program pays for the care of an individual eligible for Medicaid.\u201d (Medicaid Program; State Plan Requirements and Other Provisions Relating to State Third Party Liability Programs, 55 Fed.Reg. 1423-1424 (Jan. 16, 1990).)</p>\n<p id=\"b859-7\">At the time Congress first enacted Medicaid, health care providers often supplemented below-cost payments from the state with contributions from the needy patient or his or her relatives. (See <em>Resident v. Moot </em>(Minn. 1981) 305 N.W.2d 311, 313.) Recognizing that any amount charged directly to a Medicaid beneficiary for medical services would \u201cinterfere with the [beneficiary\u2019s] access to the medical attention he needs\u201d <em>(Yanez v. Jones </em>(D. Utah 1973) 361 F.Supp. 701, 706), the Secretary promulgated 45 Code of Federal Regulations part 249.31 (1969) which eventually became 42 Code of Federal Regulations part 447.15.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> (See also Supplementation of Payments Made to Skilled Nursing Homes; Medical Assistance, Notice of Interim Policies and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"818\">*818</page-number>Requirements, 33 Fed.Reg. 14894-14895 (Oct. 4, 1968).) Like 42 Code of Federal Regulations part 447.15, this regulation forced state plans to require providers to accept the Medicaid payment as \u201cpayment in full\u201d (45 C.F.R. \u00a7 249.31 (1969)) and to prohibit providers from recovering from the beneficiary any amount exceeding the Medicaid payment (see <em>Yanez, </em>at p. 706; <em>Sargeant v. Commr. of Public Welfare, supra, </em>423 N.E.2d at p. 761, fn. 12.)</p>\n<p id=\"b860-4\">In the nursing home context, however, \u201cmany states were unable to bear the entire cost of providing medical care to the needy, notwithstanding the states\u2019 receipt of federal funds.\u201d <em>(Resident </em>v. <em>Noot, supra, </em>305 N.W.2d at p. 313.) Congress acknowledged that these states \u201cdepend[ed] upon the supplementation of the State agency\u2019s below-cost allowances for care with contributions from relatives or the needy individual himself.\u201d (Sen.Rep. No. 744, 1st Sess. (1967), reprinted in 1967 U.S. Code Cong. &amp; Admin. News, p. 3026.) But Congress concluded that \u201c[a]s a matter of public policy, it would be best for all concerned: the needy individual, his relatives, the State agency, and the nursing home if the reimbursement made by the State represented the reasonable cost or reasonable charges for comparable services.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>The Secretary therefore delayed the implementation of the payment in full requirement for nursing homes but required state plans to phase out their practice of supplementation within a reasonable period of time.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> (See <em>Johnson\u2019s Professional Nursing Home v. Weinberger, supra, </em>490 F.2d at p. 845; see also 33 Fed.Reg. 14895 (Oct. 4, 1968); Supplementation of Payments Made to Skilled Nursing Homes; State Plan Requirements, 34 Fed.Reg. 1397 (Jan. 29, 1969).)</p>\n<p id=\"b860-5\">In the 1970\u2019s and 1980\u2019s, Congress amended the Medicaid statutes to permit some cost-sharing charges, such as copayments and deductibles. Under these amendments, state plans could charge Medicaid beneficiaries certain nominal cost-sharing amounts. (See Medicaid Program; Imposition of Cost Sharing Charges Under Medicaid, 50 Fed.Reg. 23009 (May 30, 1985).) \u201cThe basic intent of providing States with the option of imposing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"819\">*819</page-number>cost-sharing requirements . . . [was] to prevent [beneficiary] over-utilization of health care services covered under Medicaid by imposing a nominal payment obligation on [beneficiaries].\u201d (55 Fed.Reg. 1429 (Jan. 16, 1990).) In 1985, Congress enacted 42 United States Code section 1396a(a)(25)(C) to clarify \u201cthe responsibility of Medicaid [beneficiaries] for copayments and deductibles when third parties are liable for payments on their behalf.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> (Sen.Rep. No. 99-146, 2d Sess. (1985), reprinted in 1986 U.S. Code Cong. &amp; Admin. News, pp. 279-280.)</p>\n<p id=\"b861-5\">Pursuant to section 1396a(a)(25)(C) of title 42 of the United States Code, the Secretary promulgated 42 Code of Federal Regulations part 447.20. \u201cThe intent of this provision [was] to protect the Medicaid [beneficiary] from being charged for a service in excess of the amounts allowed under the State plan after considering the third party\u2019s liability.\u201d (55 Fed.Reg. 1428 (Jan. 16, 1990).) Parts 447.15 and 447.20 of 42 Code of Federal Regulations therefore had complementary purposes. \u201cUnder \u00a7 447.15, the provider is limited to the amount paid by the agency plus any deductible, coinsurance or copayment required by the plan and is not entitled to collect additional payment from the State.\u201d (55 Fed.Reg. 1428 (Jan. 16, 1990).) Meanwhile, part 447.20 \u201cprohibits the provider from seeking to collect from the Medicaid [beneficiary] any amount that exceeds the amount, if any, allowed as [beneficiary] liability in the State plan (\u00a7 447.20(a)).\u201d (55 Fed.Reg. 1428 (Jan. 16, 1990).)</p>\n<p id=\"b861-6\">As evidenced by this legislative history, the Secretary clearly intended to bar a health care provider from recovering from a Medicaid beneficiary any amount exceeding the cost-sharing charges allowed under the state plan. The Secretary found it necessary to impose this limitation on provider recovery in order to effectuate Congress\u2019s intent and to ensure medical care for the needy. (See <em>Yanez </em>v. <em>Jones, supra, </em>361 F.Supp. at p. 706.) As noted earlier, the Secretary has \u201cbroad authority\u201d to effectuate Congress\u2019s intent in this context, and we must give its regulations \u201c \u2018legislative effect.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Schweiker, supra, </em>453 U.S. at pp. 43-44 [101 S.Ct. at pp. 2639-2640].)</p>\n<p id=\"b861-7\">Our review of the language of these federal statutes and regulations limiting provider reimbursement in the context of the surrounding regulatory framework confirms this intent. Where, as here, probable liability of a third party cannot be established at the time the claim is filed, the state agency must pay the full amount due under its payment schedule. (See 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 433.139(c).) Under 42 Code of Federal Regulations part 447.15, the provider must \u201caccept\u201d this payment plus any cost-sharing charges allowed under the plan as \u201cpayment in full.\u201d Meanwhile, 42 United States Code <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"820\">*820</page-number>section 1396a(a)(25)(C) and 42 Code of Federal Regulations part 447.20 (2002)\u2014the corresponding regulation\u2014prohibit providers from collecting from \u201can individual who is entitled to medical assistance under the state plan with respect to a service for which a third party is liable for payment\u201d if \u201cthe amount of the liabilities of the third parties . . . is\u201d equal to or greater than the amount payable under the state plan. (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396a(a)(25)(C); see also 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 447.20.) If the amount of the liabilities of the third party is less than the amount payable under the state plan, then the provider may collect from the individual <em>only </em>the lesser of \u201c[a]ny cost-sharing payment amount\u201d (42 C.F.R. \u00a7 447.20(a)(2)(i)) or \u201c[a]n amount which represents the difference between the amount payable under the State plan . . . and the total of the established third party liability for the services\u201d (42 C.F.R. \u00a7 447.20(a)(2)(ii); see also 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396a(a)(25)(C)).</p>\n<p id=\"b862-4\">Read together, these statutes and regulations are unambiguous and limit provider collections from a Medicaid beneficiary to, at most, the cost-sharing charges allowed under the state plan, even when a third party tortfeasor is later found liable for the injuries suffered by that beneficiary. (See <em>Mallo v. Public Health Trust of Dade County </em>(S.D.Fla. 2000) 88 F.Supp.2d 1376, 1385 <em>(Mallo) </em>[42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396a(a)(25)(C) requires \u201cthe health care provider to collect from the Medicaid patient no more than the amount of the Medicaid payment\u201d].) Thus, a health care provider may, at most, recover a \u201cnominal\u201d amount from the beneficiary. (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396o(a)(3) [\u201cany deduction, cost sharing, or similar charge imposed under the plan . . . will be nominal in amount\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b862-5\">By contrast, under sections 14124.791 and 14124.74, a provider, after refunding the Medi-Cal payment, may recover the <em>full customary charge </em>for its services through a lien on the beneficiary\u2019s property\u2014i.e., his or her recovery for lost wages or pain and suffering. Because this customary charge is usually, if not always, greater than the amount payable under Medicaid (see <em>McAmis v. Wallace, supra, </em>980 F.Supp. at p. 182), these sections allow the provider to recover from the beneficiary an amount <em>greater </em>than the nominal cost-sharing charges allowed under the state plan. Because sections 14124.791 and 14124.74 allow the provider to recover more than these cost-sharing charges from the beneficiary, they cannot coexist with federal law and stand as an obstacle to the accomplishment of Congress\u2019s intent. (See <em>English, supra, </em>496 U.S. at p. 79. [110 S.Ct. at p. 2275])</p>\n<p id=\"b862-6\">While federal statutes and regulations do not bar a provider from recovering from liable third parties, we reject defendant\u2019s contention that there is no collection from the beneficiary for purposes of federal law when a provider collects on a lien pursuant to sections 14124.791 and 14124.74. \u201cA <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"821\">*821</page-number>lien is a charge imposed in some mode other than by a transfer in trust <em>upon specific property </em>by which it is made security for the performance of an act.\u201d (Civ. Code, \u00a7 2872, italics added.) In this case, a lien filed under section 14124.791 imposes a charge on the <em>entire </em>judgment, compromise, or settlement obtained by the Medicaid beneficiary, and the <em>entire </em>award otherwise accruing to the beneficiary may be used to satisfy the lien. Thus, a provider\u2019s recovery on the lien may encompass the portion of the judgment, compromise, or settlement compensating the beneficiary for, among other things, lost wages and pain and suffering\u2014and not just the portion compensating her for medical expenses.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> As such, sections 14124.791 and 14124.74 necessarily allow the provider to assert an interest in the <em>personal property of the Medicaid beneficiary. </em>(See <em>Martin ex rel. Hoff </em>v. <em>City of Rochester </em>(Minn. 2002) 642 N.W.2d 1, 15-16 (Martin) [claims \u201cwhich accrue to the medical assistance recipient as a result of the injuries that necessitated the medical care ... are the personal property of the medical assistance recipient\u201d]; cf. Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 695.030, subds. (a), (b)(2) [stating that \u201c[a] cause of action for money or property that is the subject of a pending action or special proceeding\u201d is the \u201cproperty of the judgment debtor\u201d and may be \u201csubject to enforcement of a money judgment\u201d].) And they do not give the provider the right to collect its fees directly from the third party tortfeasor. Recovery on a provider lien filed pursuant to section 14124.791 therefore comes from the beneficiary\u2014and not from the third party tortfeasor\u2014for purposes of federal law.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-5\">Even assuming federal law is ambiguous on this point, the June 9, 1997, policy clarification letter sent by the Acting Director of the Medicaid Bureau of the HCFA to all state Medicaid directors confirms that sections 14124.791 and 14124.74 conflict with federal law.  Where a federal regulation is ambiguous, \u201can agency\u2019s interpretation of its own regulation is entitled to deference.\u201d <em>(Christensen v. Harris County </em>(2000) 529 U.S. 576, 588 [120 S.Ct. 1655, 1663, 146 L.Ed.2d 621] <em>(Christensen).) </em> As \u201cthe Secretary\u2019s attempt to give interpretive guidance to the states in advance of their submission of state Medicaid plans\u201d <em>(Elizabeth Blackwell Center, supra, </em>61 F.3d at p. 181, fn. omitted), this letter is a policy directive entitled to considerable deference (see <em>id. </em>at pp. 181-182 [according great deference to a policy directive issued by the Director of the Medicaid Bureau of the HCFA]).<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> In the letter, the acting director stated that \u201c[f]ederal law would not preclude the practice of providers pursuing payment in tort situations in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"822\">*822</page-number>excess of Medicaid reimbursement\u201d as long as a state satisfies two conditions. First, the state must assure that Medicaid is made whole before the provider recovers any money. Second, the state must protect the assets of Medicaid beneficiaries by limiting provider recovery to the portion of the award specifically allocated for the beneficiary\u2019s medical expenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-4\">Although sections 14124.791 and 14124.74 meet the first condition, they do not meet the second. Under these statutes, the <em>entire </em>award obtained by the Medicaid beneficiary is subject to a lien filed under section 14124.791; the statutes do not limit provider recovery to the portion of the award specifically allocated to medical expenses. As the policy clarification observed, portions of the award unrelated to medical expenses constitute the \u201cgeneral assets of the\u201d beneficiary for purposes of federal law. Even if the beneficiary may request an allocation of the award, as suggested by defendant, nothing in the statutes ensures that the provider\u2019s recovery will be limited to the portion of the award allocated to medical expenses.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Thus, the provider lien statutes do not satisfy the second condition required by the policy clarification. Because the letter clearly states that any scheme permitting provider recovery in excess of Medicaid reimbursement without satisfying this condition violates federal law, sections 14124.791 and 14124.74 are preempted.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b864-5\">Cases holding that a lien asserted by a state Medicaid agency against the entire judgment, compromise or settlement of a Medicaid beneficiary \u201cdoes not violate the statutory prohibition against imposing a lien against a beneficiary\u2019s property\u201d are inapposite. <em>(Cricchio v. Pennisi </em>(1997) 90 N.Y.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"823\">*823</page-number>296 [660 N.Y.S.2d 679, 683 N.E.2d 301, 305].)<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> These cases hold that the agency\u2019s lien does not attach to the property of the beneficiary because the beneficiary, by statute, has to assign to the agency \u201cany rights he or she has to seek reimbursement from any third party up to the amount of medical assistance paid.\u201d (Cricchio, at p. 304.) \u201cBecause the injured Medicaid [beneficiary] has assigned its recovery rights to [the state agency], and [the agency] is subrogated to the rights of the beneficiary [citations], the settlement proceeds are resources of the third-party tortfeasor that are owed to [the agency].\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 305.) The state agency therefore \u201csteps in and puts a lien on the recovery <em>before it becomes the property of the Medicaid [beneficiary\\. (Wilson v. Washington, supra, </em>10 P.3d at p. 1066, italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b865-5\">Medicaid beneficiaries do not, however, have to assign to providers their right to recover from third parties. Thus, a provider does not have a direct cause of action against a third party tortfeasor and may not independently recover any amount from that tortfeasor. Consequently, a lien filed under section 14124.791 does not attach until <em>after </em>the judgment, compromise, or settlement becomes the property of the Medicaid beneficiary. Recovery of any amount not allocated to medical expenses therefore constitutes a collection from the beneficiary\u2019s personal property. Because the lien allows the provider to recover from the beneficiary an amount <em>exceeding </em>the nominal cost-sharing charges allowed by federal Medicaid law, the lien cannot coexist with federal law and stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment of the objectives of Medicaid.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-6\">While no California courts have addressed the preemption question (but see <em>Palumbo v. Myers </em>(1983) 149 Cal.App.3d 1020, 1031, fn. 10 [197 Cal.Rptr. 214] [acknowledging the \u201clurking preemption question\u201d]), our finding of preemption comports with decisions reached by other jurisdictions. In <em>Public Health Trust of Dade Co. v. Dade Co. School Bd. </em>(Fla.Dist.Ct.App. 1997) 693 So.2d 562, 567, a Florida court of appeal found that federal law preempted a state regulation analogous to section 14124.791. Under this regulation, a provider could recover \u201cthird-party benefits on behalf of Medicaid and after Medicaid has been made whole, \u2018any excess third-party benefits collected by a provider are permitted to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"824\">*824</page-number>applied to provider charges that exceed Medicaid payment. . . \u201d <em>(Public Health Trust, </em>at p. 564, quoting Fla. Admin. Code Ann. r. 59G-7.055, subd. (6).) Invalidating the regulation, the court concluded that it was \u201cin direct conflict with federal [Mjedicaid laws . . \u2022. which provide that when a medical provider accepts payment from Medicaid, such payment constitutes \u2018payment in full.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Public Health Trust, </em>at p. 566.)</p>\n<p id=\"b866-5\">Using similar reasoning, the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals barred a provider from suing a Medicaid beneficiary for the full cost of its services even though the provider was willing to refund the Medicaid payment. <em>(Evanston Hospital v. Hauck </em>(7th Cir. 1993) 1 F.3d 540, 544 <em>(Hauck).) </em>In <em>Hauck, </em>a provider was paid by the state Medicaid agency. After the patient obtained a multimillion-dollar judgment, the provider sued the Medicaid beneficiary and the state agency, seeking a declaration that the provider could refund the Medicaid payment and sue the beneficiary for the full cost of its services. Citing various state and federal statutes, including 42 United States Code section 1396a(a)(25), the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals concluded that the provider could not recover from the beneficiary once it received payment from Medicaid. <em>(Hauck, </em>at pp. 543-544.) Although <em>Hauck </em>did not involve a state statute that expressly authorized provider recovery from a beneficiary, its conclusion is equally applicable here.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-6\">A Florida federal district court also used this reasoning to hold that a Medicaid beneficiary may sue a provider under title 42 United States Code section 1983. (See <em>Mallo, supra, </em>88 F.Supp.2d at p. 1391.) In <em>Mallo, </em>a provider sought to recover more than the Medicaid payment by asserting a lien for the full costs of its services against any recovery obtained by a Medicaid beneficiary. The court found that the patient could sue the provider for asserting this lien because \u201cthe structure of [section] 1396a(a)(25)(C) creates a third-party beneficiary contractual obligation on the part of the health care provider to collect from the Medicaid patient <em>no more than </em>the amount of the Medicaid payment.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1385, italics added.) \u201cOnce a health care provider commits to Medicaid assistance for a patient, the provider is barred from billing the patient for an amount in excess of the State\u2019s Medicaid disbursement.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1387.)</p>\n<p id=\"b866-7\">These cases establish that a provider that treats a Medicaid beneficiary may not recover from that beneficiary an amount exceeding the Medicaid payment by asserting a lien against the beneficiary\u2019s entire recovery from a third party tortfeasor. Defendant does not cite, and we could not find, any case law to the contrary. In fact, virtually every case addressing the federal Medicaid statutes and regulations governing provider reimbursement holds that \u201c[u]nder federal law, medical service providers must accept the state-approved Medicaid payment as payment-in-full, and may not require that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"825\">*825</page-number>patients pay anything beyond that amount.\u201d <em>(Barney v. Holzer Clinic, Ltd. </em>(6th Cir. 1997) 110 F.3d 1207, 1210.)<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> By finding that federal law preempts sections 14124.791 and 14124.74 and, in doing so, renders defendant\u2019s lien invalid, we merely join this chorus.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-5\">Defendant\u2019s contention that federal law prohibits only balance billing\u2014 and not the substitute billing authorized by sections 14124.791 and 14124.74\u2014is not persuasive. We acknowledge that liens filed pursuant to section 14124.791 are not strictly a form of balance billing because the lien holder must refund the Medi-Cal payment before recovering on them. But nothing in the language or history of the federal statutes and regulations restricting provider recovery from Medicaid beneficiaries limits their restrictions to balance billing. The mere fact that \u201c[tjhese restrictions are commonly known as the prohibition against \u2018balance billing\u2019 \u201d does not mean that these restrictions only prohibit balance billing. <em>(Palumbo v. Myers, supra, </em>149 Cal.App.3d at p. 1025.)</p>\n<p id=\"b867-6\">The Secretary\u2019s approval of California\u2019s Medicaid plan does not dictate a contrary conclusion. Even assuming this approval \u201cis entitled to great weight and deference\u201d <em>(RCJ Medical Services, Inc. v. Bonta' </em>(2001) 91 Cal.App.4th 986, 1010 [111 Cal.Rptr.2d 223]; see also <em>Garfield Medical Center </em>v. <em>Belsh\u00e9 </em>(1998) 68 Cal.App.4th 798, 808 [80 Cal.Rptr.2d 527]), nothing in the record indicates that the Secretary approved California\u2019s provider lien provisions or that California even submitted these provisions to the Secretary for approval. Thus, the Secretary\u2019s approval of California\u2019s plan does not mean the Secretary approved sections 14124.791 and 14124.74. (See <em>In re Washington State Dept, of Social and Health Servs. </em>(U.S.H.H.S.App.Div. 1996) 1996 WL 157123 [absent evidence the state submitted the specific provisions at issue to the Secretary, approval of the state plan does not equate to agency ratification of those provisions].) Indeed, the 1997 policy clarification strongly suggests that the Secretary would not approve these lien statutes. (See <em>ante, </em>at pp. 821-822.)  In any event, the Secretary\u2019s actions are only entitled to deference if they are not arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"826\">*826</page-number>discretion, or in conflict with governing law. (See <em>RCJ Medical, </em>at p. 1011.) And the Secretary\u2019s \u201cinterpretation of its own regulations\u201d is only controlling if it is neither \u201c \u2018 \u201cplainly erroneous [n]or inconsistent with the regulation.\u2019\u201d\u201d <em>(Thomas Jefferson Univ. v. Shalala </em>(1994) 512 U.S. 504, 512 [114 S.Ct. 2381, 2386, 129 L.Ed.2d 405].)  Because sections 14124.791 and 14124.74 conflict with the plain language of governing federal statutes and regulations (see <em>ante, </em>at pp. 820-822), the Secretary\u2019s approval does not control here.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-4\">We also do not find the April 19, 1995, HCFA letter persuasive. In the letter, Sharon Yee, Chief of the Program Operations Branch, Division of Medicaid, HCFA, answered several questions posed by an attorney. Her letter opined that \u201c[n]o federal waiver [was] required for the implementation of [Welfare and Institutions Code sections] 14124.791 and 14019.3\u201d and that these sections do not conflict with 42 Code of Federal Regulations part 447.15. Her conclusions, however, are not persuasive because Yee did not consider all the relevant federal statutes and regulations, including 42 United States Code section 1396a(a)(25)(C) and part 447.20 of 42 Code of Federal Regulations. (See <em>Christensen, supra, </em>529 U.S. at p. 587 [120 S.Ct. at p. 1663] [\u201c[I]nterpretations contained in formats such as opinion letters are \u2018entitled to respect\u2019 . . . , but only to the extent that those interpretations have the \u2018power to persuade\u2019 \u201d].) Moreover, Yee\u2019s letter predates and conflicts with the 1997 policy clarification issued by the acting director of the HCFA. Because an agency\u2019s institutional pronouncements command greater respect than the pronouncements of an administrator, we decline to accord any deference to Yee\u2019s letter. (See <em>Irving </em>v. <em>U.S., supra, </em>162 F.3d at p. 166.) In any event, federal law is not ambiguous and unequivocally prohibits California from authorizing provider recovery on liens against the entire judgment or settlement obtained by a Medicaid beneficiary from a third party tortfeasor. (See <em>ante, </em>at pp. 820-822.) We therefore conclude that federal law preempts sections 14124.791 and 14124.74. (See <em>Christensen, supra, 529 </em>U.S. at p. 588 [120 S.Ct. at p. 1663] [holding that deference to an agency\u2019s interpretation of its regulations is only appropriate where the regulation is ambiguous].) These provider lien statutes are therefore unconstitutional, and the California statute limiting provider recovery from Medicaid beneficiaries in accordance with federal Medicaid law controls. This statute prohibits providers from attempting to obtain payment for their services directly from Medicaid beneficiaries. (See \u00a7 14019.4, subd. (a).) Because defendant\u2019s lien against plaintiff constitutes such an attempt, it is invalid, unenforceable, and uncollectible.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-5\">But we do so reluctantly. By invalidating liens filed pursuant to section 14124.791, we give the third party tortfeasor a windfall at the expense of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"827\">*827</page-number>innocent health care provider. Because the provider may no longer assert a lien for the full cost of its services, the Medicaid beneficiary may only recover the amount payable under Medicaid as his or her medical expenses in an action against a third party tortfeasor. (See <em>Hanif </em>v. <em>Housing Authority </em>(1988) 200 Cal.App.3d 635, 639-644 [246 Cal.Rptr. 192] [where the provider has relinquished any claim to additional reimbursement, a Medicaid beneficiary may only recover the amount payable under the state Medicaid plan as medical expenses in a tort action].) As a result, the tortfeasor escapes liability for the full amount of the medical expenses he or she wrongfully caused. Such a result not only benefits the party who should be responsible for the medical costs of the beneficiary at the expense of the blameless provider, it also harms society as a whole. Because health care providers cannot recover the full costs of their services from responsible tortfeasors, they must either charge more to those innocent patients who can pay in order to recoup their losses or stop providing medical care to the needy. In the end, everybody suffers but the third party tortfeasor. We therefore urge the Legislature to remedy this anomaly in a manner consistent with federal law.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b869-6\">Despite finding that federal law preempts the lien provisions, we must still determine whether the trial court properly sustained defendant\u2019s demurrer and dismissed plaintiffs entire action on other grounds. We conclude it did.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-7\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b869-8\">We begin with plaintiffs unfair competition claim. In affirming the dismissal of this claim, the Court of Appeal held that plaintiffs \u201cUCL claim is . . . barred by Cel-Tech\u2019s safe harbor protection.\u201d Plaintiff contends there is no safe harbor for defendant\u2019s practice of filing liens under section 14124.791 if the lien provisions are preempted by federal law. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-9\">As relevant here, \u201c[t]he UCL defines unfair competition as any unlawful, unfair or fraudulent business practice . . . .\u201d <em>(Lazar v. Hertz Corp. </em>(1999) 69 Cal.App.4th 1494, 1505 [82 Cal.Rptr.2d 368]; see also Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7 17200.) A business practice is unlawful \u201cif it is forbidden by any law . . . .\u201d <em>(People v. Duz-Mor Diagnostic Laboratory, Inc. </em>(1998) 68 Cal.App.4th 654, 658 [80 Cal.Rptr.2d 419].) A business practice, however, may be unfair or fraudulent in violation of the UCL even if the practice does not violate any law. (See <em>Cel-Tech, supra, </em>20 Cal.4th at p. 180.)</p>\n<p id=\"b869-10\">In <em>Cel-Tech, </em>we considered a UCL claim for unfair\u2014but not unlawful\u2014 business practices and recognized a safe harbor from such claims for acts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"828\">*828</page-number>expressly allowed by the Legislature. \u201cIf the Legislature has permitted certain conduct or considered a situation and concluded no action should lie, courts may not override that determination. When specific legislation provides a \u2018safe harbor,\u2019 plaintiffs may not use the general unfair competition law to assault that harbor.\u201d <em>(Cel-Tech, supra, </em>20 Cal.4th at p. 182.) Thus, \u201c[a]cts that the Legislature has determined to be lawful may not form the basis for an action under the unfair competition law . . . .\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 183.) Nonetheless, \u201cthe Legislature\u2019s mere failure to prohibit an activity does not prevent a court from finding it unfair.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 184.)</p>\n<p id=\"b870-4\">Although plaintiff concedes sections 14124.791 and 14124.74 expressly permitted the liens filed by defendant, she contends these statutes do not provide a safe harbor for defendant\u2019s conduct because they conflict with federal law. This contention is meritless.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-5\">We initially reject plaintiffs contention that these statutes do not insulate \u25a0 defendant\u2019s conduct from a UCL claim because defendant violated federal Medicaid law by filing the liens. According to plaintiff, the <em>Cel-Tech </em>safe harbor cannot protect defendant from UCL claims for <em>unlawful </em>business practices. We, however, need not determine whether the safe harbor applies to unlawful business practices, because plaintiff cannot establish that defendant violated federal law.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> \u201cPrivate providers of services . . . derive their obligations from state law and through their contractual agreements with the states, <em>not from title XIX.\u201d (Stewart v. Bernstein </em>(5th Cir. 1985) 769 F.2d 1088, 1094, italics added.) Federal Medicaid statutes and regulations do not impose \u201cany obligation upon Medicaid providers.\u201d <em>(Yanez v. Jones, supra, </em>361 F.Supp. at p. 707; see also <em>Harding v. Summit Medical Center </em>(9th Cir. 2002) 41 Fed.Appx. 83, 84 [\u201c[U.S.C.] \u00a7 1396a(a)(25)(C) ... is formulated as a requirement of a state plan; it imposes no independent obligation on medical providers\u201d].) Rather, they create \u201ca duty which runs to the State alone.\u201d <em>(Yanez, </em>at p. 707.) \u201c \u2018It is clear from the legislative history that. . . the [Medicaid] legislation is primarily directed at the role of participating <em>states </em>in providing medical care with the assistance of federal funds.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Solter v. Health Partners of Philadelphia </em>(E.D.Pa. 2002) 215 F.Supp.2d 533, 540.) Because federal Medicaid law governs states\u2014and not providers\u2014 defendants did not and could not violate federal law by filing liens under section 14124.791.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-6\">None of the cases cited by plaintiff hold to the contrary. In <em>Hauck, </em>the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals declared that the provider would violate Illinois statutes\u2014which were consistent with the requirements imposed by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"829\">*829</page-number>federal Medicaid law\u2014if it sought recovery from a Medicaid beneficiary after refunding the Medicaid payment. (See <em>Hauck, supra, </em>1 F.3d at pp. 542-543.) It did not hold that the provider would violate federal law. Likewise, <em>Samuel </em>v. <em>California Dept, of Health Services </em>(N.D.Cal. 1983) 570 F.Supp. 566, 573, merely found that the state Medicaid agency misconstrued its own regulation and enjoined the agency from advising health care providers to follow its erroneous construction. It found no violation of federal law by a provider. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 574.) Finally, the Court of Appeal in <em>Brillantes </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1996) 51 Cal.App.4th 323, 336-339 [58 Cal.Rptr.2d 770], only examined a provider\u2019s obligations under certain California Medi-Cal statutes and did not consider or discuss federal Medicaid law.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-5\">We also reject plaintiffs contention that sections 14124.791 and 14124.74 do not provide a safe harbor from her UCL claim because our finding of preemption should apply retroactively. By enacting these statutes, the Legislature declared that provider liens were lawful so long as the statutes remained in effect. (See <em>Cel-Tech, supra, </em>20 Cal.4th at pp. 183-184.) Moreover, \u201cretroactive application of a decision disapproving prior authority on which a person may reasonably rely in determining what conduct will subject the person to penalties, denies due process.\u201d <em>(Moss </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1998) 17 Cal.4th 396, 429 [71 Cal.Rptr.2d 215, 950 P.2d 59].) Validly enacted statutes such as sections 14124.791 and 14124.74 undoubtedly constitute such authority. Just as courts must presume \u201cthat the Legislature intended . . . not to violate the Constitution, but to enact a valid statute within the scope of its constitutional powers\u201d <em>(Miller v. Municipal Court </em>(1943) 22 Cal.2d 818, 828 [142 P.2d 297]), Californians should be able to presume that statutes enacted by the Legislature are constitutional. Otherwise, we place our citizens in the untenable position of guessing whether their conduct may subject them to penalty even when the Legislature has expressly condoned it. (Cf. <em>Michigan v. DeFillippo </em>(1979) 443 U.S. 31, 37-38 [99 S.Ct. 2627, 2632, 61 L.Ed.2d 343] [\u201cA prudent officer . . . should not have been required to anticipate that a court would later hold the ordinance unconstitutional\u201d].) We therefore conclude that sections 14124.791 and 14124.74 create a safe harbor protecting defendant from plaintiffs claim of unfair business practices.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-6\">Using similar reasoning, we find that plaintiff cannot state an unfair competition claim premised on defendant\u2019s alleged breach of its Medi-Cal provider agreement. Assuming that the provider agreements in the record accurately reflect defendant\u2019s current agreement, they establish that \u201cPart 3, Division 9 of the Welfare and Institutions Code\u201d\u2014which includes sections <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"830\">*830</page-number>14124.791 and 14124.74\u2014governs and supersedes any conflicting provisions in the agreement.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Sections 14124.791 and 14124.74 therefore provide defendant with a safe harbor from unfair competition claims premised on any breach of its provider agreement. Accordingly, we find that the trial court properly sustained the demurrer to plaintiffs unfair competition claim without leave to amend.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-4\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b872-5\">We now turn to plaintiffs tort claims. In affirming the dismissal of these claims, the Court of Appeal held that the litigation privilege shielded defendant from plaintiffs tort claims. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-6\">The litigation privilege, as codified in Civil Code section 47, subdivision (b), shields, among other things, any \u201cpublication or broadcast\u201d made \u201c[i]n any . . . judicial proceeding.\u201d The privilege is \u201cabsolute in nature\u201d <em>(Silberg v. Anderson </em>(1990) 50 Cal.3d 205, 215 [266 Cal.Rptr. 638, 786 P.2d 365]), and its \u201cprincipal purpose ... is to afford litigants and witnesses . . . the utmost freedom of access to the courts without fear of being harassed subsequently by derivative tort actions\u201d <em>(id. </em>at p. 213). \u201cAlthough the litigation privilege was originally limited to shielding litigants, attorneys and witnesses from liability for defamation [citations], it has been interpreted to apply to virtually all torts except malicious prosecution.\u201d <em>(Kimmel </em>v. <em>Goland </em>(1990) 51 Cal.3d 202, 209 [271 Cal.Rptr. 191, 793 P.2d 524].)</p>\n<p id=\"b872-7\">\u201cThe usual formulation is that the privilege applies to any communication (1) made in judicial or quasi-judicial proceedings; (2) by litigants or other participants authorized by law; (3) to achieve the objects of the litigation; and (4) that have some connection or logical relation to the action.\u201d <em>(Silberg v. Anderson, supra, </em>50 Cal.3d at p. 212.) As a general rule, the privilege \u201c \u2018applies only to communicative acts and does not privilege tortious courses of conduct.\u2019 \u201d <em>(LiMandri v. Judkins </em>(1997) 52 Cal.App.4th 326, 345 [60 Cal.Rptr.2d 539], quoting <em>Kupiec v. American Internat. Adjustment Co. </em>(1991) 235 Cal.App.3d 1326, 1331 [1 Cal.Rptr.2d 371].) We have, however, extended the privilege to \u201cany publication . . . that is required [citation] or permitted [citation] by law in the course of a judicial proceeding to achieve the objects of the litigation, even though the publication is made outside the courtroom and no function of the court or its officers is invoked.\u201d <em>(Albertson </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"831\">*831</page-number>v. <em>Raboff </em>(1956) 46 Cal.2d 375, 380-381 [295 P.2d 405].) Thus, our courts have extended the protections of the litigation privilege to \u201cthe recordation of a notice of <em>lis </em>pendens\u201d <em>(id. </em>at p. 381), \u201cthe publication of an assessment lien\u201d <em>(Wilton v. Mountain Wood Homeowners Assn., Inc. </em>(1993) 18 Cal.App.4th 565, 570 [22 Cal.Rptr.2d 471] <em>(Wilton)), </em>and \u201cthe filing of a claim of mechanic\u2019s lien in conjunction with a judicial proceeding to enforce it\u201d <em>(Frank Pisano &amp; Associates v. Taggart </em>(1972) 29 Cal.App.3d 1, 25 [105 Cal.Rptr. 414] <em>(Pisano)).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b873-5\">Plaintiff concedes sections 14124.791 and 14124.74 permitted the liens filed by defendant. Plaintiff does not dispute that defendant filed the liens to achieve the objects of the litigation or that the liens are connected to litigation filed by plaintiff and other class members. Thus, the litigation privilege shields defendant\u2019s assertion of liens pursuant to sections 14124.791 and 14124.74 from plaintiff\u2019s claims.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> (See <em>Albertson v. Raboff, supra, </em>46 Cal.2d at pp. 380-381; <em>Wilton, supra, </em>18 Cal.App.4th at p. 570; <em>Pisano, supra, </em>29 Cal.App.3d at p. 25.)</p>\n<p id=\"b873-6\">In reaching this conclusion, we reject plaintiff\u2019s contention that defendant\u2019s practice of using these statutorily authorized liens \u201cto seize funds\u201d in violation of federal law is noncommunicative conduct falling outside the litigation privilege. The only tortious acts alleged by plaintiff were defendant\u2019s assertion of liens pursuant to section 14124.791. Plaintiff did not allege that defendant committed any acts not authorized by sections 14124.791 and 14124.74. Thus, <em>LiMandri </em>is inapposite. (See <em>LiMandri v. Judkins, supra, </em>52 Cal.App.4th at p. 345 [finding that the litigation privilege did not shield the defendant\u2019s conduct because \u201cthe isolated act of filing [the defendant\u2019s] notice of lien . . . was only one act in the overall course of conduct alleged in\u201d the complaint].) Indeed, the gravamen of plaintiff\u2019s complaint is a communication\u2014the assertion of liens pursuant to sections 14124.791 and 14124.74\u2014protected by the litigation privilege. (See <em>Pacific Gas &amp; Electric Co. v. Bear Steams &amp; Co. </em>(1990) 50 Cal.3d 1118, 1132, fn. 12 [270 Cal.Rptr. 1, 791 P.2d 587].)</p>\n<p id=\"b873-7\">We. also find that defendant filed the liens as a \u201cparticipant authorized by law\u201d notwithstanding plaintiffs assertions to the contrary. (See <em>Silberg v. Anderson, supra, </em>50 Cal.3d at p. 212.) Although we hold that federal law preempts sections 14124.791 and 14124.74 and invalidates defendant\u2019s liens, defendant undoubtedly had a legal right to assert the liens prior to our <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"832\">*832</page-number>holding here. As explained earlier, we refuse to penalize defendant for following validly enacted statutes. (See <em>ante, </em>at pp. 829-830.)</p>\n<p id=\"b874-4\">Finally, we believe plaintiff distorts the impact of our application of the litigation privilege in this case. Our holding is quite limited. We merely hold that the assertion of liens as authorized by validly enacted California statutes is shielded by the litigation privilege. This limited holding does not \u201cpervert\u00ed] the judicial process and place[] the court in the unfortunate position of shielding, rather than addressing, wrongful conduct.\u201d The cases cited by plaintiff are inapposite. Neither <em>Barquis v. Merchants Collection Assn. </em>(1972) 7 Cal.3d 94 [101 Cal.Rptr. 745, 496 P.2d 817] nor <em>Yu v. Signet Bank/Virginia </em>(1999) 69 Cal.App.4th 1377 [82 Cal.Rptr.2d 304] involved liens filed pursuant to validly enacted statutes or addressed the scope of the litigation privilege. Accordingly, we find that the litigation privilege bars plaintiffs claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-5\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b874-6\">We reverse the portion of the judgment of the Court of Appeal adding a declaration that federal law preempts section 14124.791, but affirm the judgment in all other respects.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-7\">George, C.

The majority\u2019s safe harbor, in contrast, is apparently founded on concepts of constitutional due process and draws protection from state laws that, because they conflict with superior federal law, are completely unenforceable.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-6\">Were this an action seeking to <em>punish </em>defendant for conduct approved by facially valid state law, I might well agree that fundamental fairness, and hence the constitutional guarantees of due process, would bar the action. (See <em>Moss v. Superior Court </em>(1998) 17 Cal.4th 396, 429 [71 Cal.Rptr.2d 215, 950 P.2d 59] [relating to penalties].) But Business and Professions Code section 17203, which sets out the available remedies in a private action under the unfair competition law, provides for neither criminal nor civil penalties and allows no award of damages at all, much less punitive damages. <em>(Cortez </em>v. <em>Purolator Air Filtration Products Co. </em>(2000) 23 Cal.4th 163, 173 [96 Cal.Rptr.2d 518, 999 P.2d 706].) A business whose practices are found unlawful or unfair could hardly complain, on fairness grounds, of being <em>enjoined </em>from further such violations, even if the practices were based on what seemed an enforceable state law. Even a grant of the monetary relief available under Business and Professions Code section 17203 (\u201crestoration] to any person in interest any money or property . . . acquired by means of such unfair competition\u201d) is not necessarily unfair merely because the defendant business believed in good faith that its practice was lawful. \u201cRather, in general, as between a person who is enriched as the result of his or her violation of the law, and a person intended to be protected by the law <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"834\">*834</page-number>who is harmed by its violation, for the violator to retain the benefit would be unjust.\u201d <em>(Cortez v. Purolator Air Filtration Products Co., supra, </em>at p. 182 (conc. opn. of Werdegar, J.).)</p>\n<p id=\"b876-4\">For these reasons, I concur in the result, but not all the reasoning, of the majority opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
