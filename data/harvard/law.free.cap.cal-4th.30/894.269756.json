Section 4 of Proposition 21 added Penal Code, section 186.22, subdivision (d) (section 186.22(d)),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> which provides that \u201c[a]ny person who is convicted of a public offense punishable as a felony or a misdemeanor,\u201d committed for the benefit of a criminal street gang, shall be punished by imprisonment in the county jail, or by imprisonment in the state prison for one, two, or three years. In this case, we decide two issues: (1) whether section 186.22(d) is a sentence enhancement, an alternate penalty provision, or a substantive offense; and (2) whether section 186.22(d) applies to all misdemeanors and all felonies or only to \u201cwobblers\u201d; namely, those public offenses that are punishable, in the alternative, as a misdemeanor or a felony.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The Court of Appeal concluded that section 186.22(d) was an alternate penalty provision that applied to all misdemeanors and all felonies. We agree and affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b940-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"898\">*898</page-number>I. Factual and Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b940-4\">The Orange County District Attorney\u2019s Office filed an amended petition against petitioner under Welfare and Institutions Code, section 602 alleging,. in count one, a violation of section 186.22(d) as a substantive offense; in count two, a violation of section 186.22, subdivision (a), active participation in a criminal street gang; and in count three, a violation of section 242, misdemeanor battery. Petitioner demurred on the grounds that section 186.22(d) did not create a substantive offense and applied only to wobblers. The trial court overruled the demurrer and petitioner sought a writ of prohibition/mandate in the Court of Appeal. The Court of Appeal held that section 186.22(d) created a penalty provision that applied to any gang-related misdemeanor or felony. It ordered the trial court to sustain the demurrer as to count 1 of the amended petition, with leave to amend.</p>\n<p id=\"b940-5\">II. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b940-6\">Section 186.22(d) provides in full: \u201cAny person who is convicted of a public offense punishable as a felony or a misdemeanor, which is committed for the benefit of, at the direction of or in association with, any criminal street gang with the specific intent to promote, further, or assist in any criminal conduct by gang members, shall be punished by imprisonment in the county jail not to exceed one year, or by imprisonment in the state prison for one, two, or three years, provided that any person sentenced to imprisonment in the county jail shall be imprisoned for a period not to exceed one year, but not less than 180 days, and shall not be eligible for release upon completion of sentence, parole, or any other basis, until he or she has served 180 days. If the court grants probation or suspends the execution of sentence imposed upon the defendant, it shall require as a condition thereof that the defendant serve 180 days in a county jail.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b940-7\">A. <em>Characterizing Section 186.22(d)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b940-8\">As a threshold matter, we must determine whether section 186.22(d) is a sentence enhancement, an alternate penalty provision, or a substantive offense. This distinction is of practical import because, as pointed out by the Court of Appeal, \u201cBy interpreting the statute as a penalty provision [as opposed to a substantive offense], prosecutors would be free to charge . . . section 186.22(d) along with the predicate offense needed to satisfy that section without running afoul of the necessarily included offense rule.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b940-9\">By definition, a sentence enhancement is \u201can additional term of imprisonment added to the base term.\u201d (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 4.405(c); <em>People v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"899\">*899</page-number><em>Jefferson </em>(1999) 21 Cal.4th 86, 101 [86 Cal.Rptr.2d 893, 980 P.2d 441] <em>(Jefferson).) </em>Section 186.22(d) is not a sentence enhancement because it does not add an additional term of imprisonment to the base term; instead, it provides for an alternate sentence when it is proven that the underlying offense has been committed for the benefit of, or in association with, a criminal street gang. Neither is it a substantive offense because it does not define or set forth elements of a new crime. (See, e.g., <em>People v. Bright </em>(1996) 12 Cal.4th 652, 661 [49 Cal.Rptr.2d 732, 909 P.2d 1354] <em>(Bright).)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b941-5\">Both petitioner and real party in interest acknowledge that section 186.22(d) is an alternate penalty provision. We agree. In <em>Bright, supra, </em>12 Cal.4th at page 669, we determined that the reference in section 664, subdivision (a)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> to premeditated attempted murder \u201csets forth a penalty provision prescribing an increased sentence . . . to be imposed upon defendant\u2019s conviction of attempted murder when the additional specified circumstances are found to be true by the trier of fact.\u201d (Fn. omitted.) We distinguished a penalty provision from an enhancement in this manner: \u201c[A] penalty provision prescribes an added penalty to be imposed when the offense is committed under specified circumstances. A penalty provision is separate from the underlying offense and does not set forth elements of the offense or a greater degree of the offense charged. [Citations.]\u201d <em>{Bright, </em>at p. 661.) \u201c[S]trictly speaking this portion of section 664 does not constitute an \u2018enhancement\u2019 within the meaning of rule 405(c) of the California Rules of Court, which defines \u2018enhancement\u2019 as \u2018an additional term of imprisonment added to the base term,\u2019 because this statutory provision establishes an increased <em>base </em>term for the crime of attempted murder upon a finding of specified circumstances.\u201d <em>{Id. </em>at p. 656, fn. 2.)</p>\n<p id=\"b941-6\">In <em>Jefferson, </em>we interpreted former section 186.22, subdivision (b)(4) (now section 186.22, subdivision (b)(5))<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> as an alternate penalty provision. Former subdivision (b)(4) provided for an alternate increased sentence in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"900\">*900</page-number>form of a higher minimum eligible parole date, for certain felonies punishable by life that were committed for the benefit of a criminal street gang.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> We stated: \u201cUnlike an enhancement, which provides for an <em>additional term </em>of imprisonment, the 15-year minimum term in [former] section 186.22(b)(4) [now subdivision (b)(5)] sets forth an <em>alternate </em>penalty for the underlying felony itself, when the jury has determined that the defendant has satisfied the conditions specified in the statute.\u201d <em>(Jefferson, supra, </em>21 Cal. 4th at p. 101.)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b942-4\">Like the statutes in <em>Bright </em>and <em>Jefferson, </em>section 186.22(d) prescribes an alternate penalty when the underlying offense is committed under specified circumstances; here, for the benefit of, at the direction of, or in association with, a criminal street gang. We therefore hold that section 186.22(d) is an alternate penalty provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b942-5\">B. <em>Section 186.22(d) Applies to Misdemeanors and Felonies</em></p>\n<p id=\"b942-6\">Petitioner argues that, because section 186.22(d) applies when a person is \u201cconvicted of a public offense punishable as a misdemeanor or felony,\u201d it is limited to wobblers, because wobblers are the only public offenses punishable as either a misdemeanor or felony. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b942-7\">As noted, the electorate passed section 186.22(d) as part of Proposition 21. \u201cIn interpreting a voter initiative . . . , we apply the same principles that govern statutory construction. (See <em>Horwich v. Superior Court </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"901\">*901</page-number>(1999) 21 Cal.4th 272, 276 [87 Cal.Rptr.2d 222, 980 P.2d 927] <em>(Horwich).) </em>Thus, [1] \u2018we turn first to the language of the statute, giving the words their ordinary meaning.\u2019 <em>(People </em>v. <em>Birkett </em>(1999) 21 Cal.4th 226, 231 [87 Cal.Rptr.2d 205, 980 P.2d 912] <em>(Birkett)) </em>[2] The statutory language must also be construed in the context of the statute as a whole and the overall statutory scheme [in light of the electorate\u2019s intent], <em>(Horwich, supra, </em>21 Cal.4th at p. 276, [280].) [3] When the language is ambiguous, \u2018we refer to other indicia of the voters\u2019 intent, particularly the analyses and arguments contained in the official ballot pamphlet.\u2019 <em>(Birkett, supra, </em>21 Cal.4th at p. 243.)\u201d <em>(People v. Rizo </em>(2000) 22 Cal.4th 681, 685 [94 Cal.Rptr.2d 375, 996 P.2d 27] <em>(Rizo).)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b943-5\">In other words, our \u201ctask is simply to interpret and apply the initiative\u2019s language so as to effectuate the electorate\u2019s intent.\u201d <em>(Hi-Voltage Wire Works, Inc. v. City of San Jose </em>(2000) 24 Cal.4th 537, 576 [101 Cal.Rptr.2d 653, 12 P.3d 1068] <em>(Hi-Voltage) </em>(conc. &amp; dis. opn. of George, C. J.).)</p>\n<p id=\"b943-6\">1. <em>Ordinary Meaning</em></p>\n<p id=\"b943-7\">Our first task is to give the section 186.22(d) phrase \u201ca public offense punishable as a felony or a misdemeanor\u201d its ordinary meaning as understood by the electorate. Section 15 defines \u201c[a] crime or public offense [as] an act committed or omitted in violation of a law forbidding or commanding it. . . .\u201d Section 16 provides that crimes and public offenses include felonies, misdemeanors and infractions. By its plain language, therefore, section 186.22(d) applies to any crime or public offense that is a felony or a misdemeanor. Any crime or public offense that is an infraction is excluded.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-8\">But petitioner contends that section 186.22(d) \u201cperfectly describes wobblers,\u201d because \u201c[w]obblers are the only public offenses <em>punishable as a misdemeanor or felony,\u201d </em>and the voters, who are presumed to know this fact, therefore intended section 186.22(d) to be limited to wobblers. We disagree. Section 17, which classifies public offenses, provides, in subdivision (a), that \u201c[a] felony is a crime which is punishable with death or by imprisonment in the state prison.\u201d Subdivision (b), the so-called wobbler section, states that \u201c[w]hen a crime is punishable, in the discretion of the court, by imprisonment in the state prison or by fine or imprisonment in the county jail, it is a misdemeanor for all purposes under [five specified] circumstances.\u201d (\u00a7 17, subd. (b).) <footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b943-9\">Thus, section 186.22(d) does not, as petitioner alleges, \u201cperfectly describe wobblers.\u201d Most glaringly, it lacks the \u201cin the discretion of the court\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"902\">*902</page-number>language of section 17, subdivision (b). Nor does section 186.22(b) utilize the section 17, subdivision (b) statutory language \u201cby imprisonment in the state prison or by fine or imprisonment in the county jail.\u201d Finally, section 186.22(d) does not state the circumstances under which such a crime will be considered a misdemeanor. It is hard to imagine that the electorate intended to limit the scope of section 186.22(d) to offenses described in section 17, subdivision (b) when section 186.22(d) does not refer to section 17, subdivision (b), or even mirror the statutory language of section 17, subdivision (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b944-4\">This conclusion is buttressed when one considers that the term \u201cwobbler\u201d does not have a meaning defined by statute or commonly understood by the electorate. Specifically, the term \u201cwobbler,\u201d as used here, does not appear in the Penal Code or in the Merriam-Webster Dictionary. <footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Instead, \u201cwobbler\u201d is a legal term of art of recent vintage, and its use is limited primarily to attorneys, judges, and law enforcement personnel who are familiar with criminal law. (See, e.g., <em>People </em>v. <em>Municipal Court (Kong) </em>(1981) 122 Cal.App.3d 176, 179, fn. 3 [175 Cal.Rptr. 861] [\u201cWobblers\u201d are \u201cthose offenses punishable either as felonies or misdemeanors, in the discretion of the court. <em>In the jargon of the criminal law, </em>[such] offenses are known as \u2018wobblers.\u2019 \u201d (Italics added.)].) We are confident that the average voter, unschooled in the patois of criminal law, would have understood the plain language of section 186.22(d) to encompass all misdemeanors and all felonies.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b945-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"903\">*903</page-number>2. <em>Statute Read as a Whole</em></p>\n<p id=\"b945-5\"><em>In People </em>v. <em>Morris </em>(1988) 46 Cal.3d 1, 16 [249 Cal.Rptr. 119, 756 P.2d 843], we stated: \u201cStatutory language should not be interpreted in isolation, but must be construed in the context of the entire statute of which it is a part, in order to achieve harmony among the parts.\u201d Applying that principle here, we look at section 186.22 as a whole. Proposition 21 repealed former section 186.22, subdivision (d), and reenacted the former subdivision\u2019s language as current subdivision (g). (See Ballot Pamp., Primary Elec. (Mar. 2000) text of Prop. 21, at pp. 119-120.) Section 186.22, subdivision (g), provides: \u201cNotwithstanding any other law, the court may strike the additional punishment for the enhancements provided in this section or <em>refuse to impose the minimum jail sentence for misdemeanors </em>in an unusual case where the interests of justice would best be served if the court specifies on the record and enters into the minutes the circumstances indicating that the interests of justice would best be served by that disposition.\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b945-6\">It is clear that the phrase \u201cminimum jail sentence for misdemeanors,\u201d as used in section 186.22, subdivision (g), refers to the section 186.22(d) penalty provision, because the term \u201cmisdemeanor\u201d appears nowhere else in section 186.22. Subdivision (g)\u2019s use of the unadorned term \u201cmisdemeanors,\u201d therefore, strongly indicates that the enhancement to which it refers applies to all misdemeanors and is not limited to \u201cwobblers.\u201d Certainly, had the electorate intended that section 186.22(d) be limited to \u201cwobblers,\u201d subdivision (g) would have stated, for example, that the \u201ccourt may . . . refuse to impose the minimum jail sentence for [public offenses deemed to be] misdemeanors [under Penal Code section 17, subdivision (b)] in an unusual case where the interests of justice would best be served . . . .\u201d It does not.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Thus, when section 186.22, subdivisions (d) and (g) are harmonized, and Proposition 21 is read as a whole, one is led to the necessary conclusion that section 186.22(d) applies to all misdemeanors and all felonies.</p>\n<p id=\"b945-7\">3. <em>Ambiguity</em></p>\n<p id=\"b945-8\">Even assuming the phrase \u201cpublic offense punishable as a felony or misdemeanor\u201d is susceptible of two interpretations and was therefore ambiguous to the voters, <em>Rizo </em>teaches that where a statute is ambiguous, \u201c \u2018we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"904\">*904</page-number>refer to other indicia of the voters\u2019 intent, particularly the analyses and arguments contained in the . . . ballot pamphlet.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Rizo, supra, </em>22 Cal.4th at p. 685, quoting <em>Birkett, supra, </em>21 Cal.4th at p. 243.)</p>\n<p id=\"b946-4\">But the Court of Appeal, in its discussion of section 186.22(d), citing <em>Hi-Voltage, supra, </em>24 Cal.4th 537, for support, analyzed previous failed legislative efforts to amend section 186.22(d), and concluded that the intent of the Proposition 21 drafters, and thus the voters, was for section 186.22(d) to apply to all misdemeanors. While its conclusion may have been correct,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> the Court of Appeal goes too far.</p>\n<p id=\"b946-5\">This court has made it clear that the \u201cmotive or purpose of the drafters of a statute is not relevant to its construction, absent reason to conclude that the body which adopted the statute was aware of that purpose and believed the language of the proposal would accomplish it. [Citations.] The opinion of drafters or legislators who sponsor an initiative is not relevant since such opinion does not represent the intent of the electorate and we cannot say with assurance that the voters were aware of the drafters\u2019 intent. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Taxpayers to Limit Campaign Spending v. Fair Pol. Practices Comm. </em>(1990) 51 Cal.3d 744, 764-765, fn. 10 [274 Cal.Rptr. 787, 799 P.2d 1220].)</p>\n<p id=\"b946-6\">In <em>Hi-Voltage, </em>while we did state that \u201cwe can discern and thereby effectuate the voters\u2019 intention only by interpreting [the initiative\u2019s] language in its historical context\u201d <em>(Hi-Voltage, supra, </em>24 Cal.4th at p. 542), we sought only to place our debate about Proposition 209<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> in its \u201crelevant analytical context\u201d <em>(Hi-Voltage, </em>at p. 544). We therefore looked back on 150 years of \u201cthe appropriate role of government concerning questions of race.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>But we were careful to point out that \u201cwe may \u2018test our construction against those extrinsic aids that bear on the enactors\u2019 intent\u2019 [citation], in particular the ballot materials accompanying Proposition 209 that place the initiative in historical context. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 560.)</p>\n<p id=\"b946-7\">Thus, our court has never strayed from our pronouncement in <em>Horwich, supra, </em>21 Cal.4th 272, that \u201clegislative antecedents\u201d \u201cnot directly presented <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"905\">*905</page-number>to the voters ... are not relevant to our inquiry.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 277, fn. 4.) Accordingly, in <em>Horwich, </em>we \u201c[c]onsider[ed] the electorate\u2019s intended goal as reflected in the language of the [statute] and in the ballot arguments . . . .\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 277.) Similarly, in <em>Delaney v. Superior Court </em>(1990) 50 Cal.3d 785, 801 [268 Cal.Rptr. 753, 789 P.2d 934], we stated, \u201c[Legislative] history would not provide us with any guidance as to <em>the voters\u2019 </em>subsequent intent because none of the indicia of the Legislature\u2019s possible intent (committee analyses and digest and letters from the statute\u2019s author) were before the voters.\u201d Thus, to the extent the Court of Appeal, in ascertaining the voters\u2019 intent, relied on evidence of the drafters\u2019 intent that was not presented to the voters, we decline to follow it.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Instead, we look to the materials that were before the voters.</p>\n<p id=\"b947-5\">a. <em>Findings and declarations</em></p>\n<p id=\"b947-6\">Proposition 21 was enacted to combat gang crime. In the \u201cFINDINGS AND DECLARATIONS\u201d section of the proposition, \u201c[t]he people [found] and declare[d]\u201d that \u201cCriminal street gangs have become more violent, bolder, and better organized in recent years. Some gangs, like the Los Angeles-based 18th Street Gang and the Mexican Mafia are properly analyzed as organized crime groups, rather than mere street gangs. A 1996 series in the Los Angeles Times chronicled the serious negative impact the 18th Street Gang has on neighborhoods where it is active.\u201d (Ballot Pamp., Primary Elec. (Mar. 7, 2000) text of Prop. 21, \u00a7 2, subd. (b), p. 119:)</p>\n<p id=\"b947-7\">\u201cVigorous enforcement and the adoption of more meaningful criminal sanctions, including the voter-approved \u2018Three Strikes\u2019 law, Proposition 184, has resulted in substantial and consistent four year decline in overall crime. Violent juvenile crime has proven most resistant to this positive trend.\u201d (Ballot Pamp., Primary Elec. (Mar. 7, 2000) text of Prop. 21, \u00a7 2, subd. (c), p. 119.)</p>\n<p id=\"b947-8\">\u201cGang-related crimes pose a unique threat to the public because of gang members\u2019 organization and solidarity. Gang-related felonies should result in severe penalties. Life without the possibility of parole or death should be available to murderers who kill as part of any gang-related activity.\u201d (Ballot Pamp., Primary Elec. (Mar. 7, 2000) text of Prop. 21, \u00a7 2, subd. (h), p. 119.)</p>\n<p id=\"b947-9\">\u201cDramatic changes are needed in the way we treat juvenile criminals [and] criminal street gangs ... if we are to avoid the predicted, unprecedented <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"906\">*906</page-number>surge in juvenile and gang violence. Californians deserve to live without fear of violent crime and to enjoy safe neighborhoods, parks, and schools. This act addresses each of these issues with the goal of creating a safer California, for ourselves and our children in the Twenty-First Century.\u201d (Ballot Pamp., Primary Elec. (Mar. 7, 2000) text of Prop. 21, \u00a7 2, subd. (k), p. 119.)</p>\n<p id=\"b948-4\">b. <em>Ballot materials</em></p>\n<p id=\"b948-5\">Proposition 21 sought to tackle, in \u201cdramatic\u201d fashion, the onerous problem of gang violence and gang crime. Viewed in this context, imposing felony punishment for gang-related misdemeanors is consistent with the spirit and intent of the Act. Indeed, Proposition 21 proponents urged that \u201cProposition 21 ends the \u2018slap on the wrist\u2019 of current law by imposing real consequences for GANG MEMBERS, RAPISTS AND MURDERERS who cannot be reached through prevention or education.\u201d (Ballot Pamp., Primary Elec. (Mar. 7, 2000) argument in favor of Prop. 21, p. 48.)</p>\n<p id=\"b948-6\">The legislative analysis of Proposition 21 contained a summary chart of the gang provisions, and stated that the act \u201c[ijncreases penalties for gang-related crimes and requires gang members to register with local law enforcement agencies.\u201d (Ballot Pamp., Primary Elec. (Mar. 7, 2000) analysis of Prop. 21 by Legis. Analyst, summary chart, p. 47.)  As with ballot pamphlet arguments, a reviewing court may look to a ballot\u2019s legislative analysis to determine voter intent. (See, e.g., <em>Legislature </em>v. <em>Eu </em>(1991) 54 Cal.3d 492, 504 [286 Cal.Rptr. 283, 816 P.2d 1309] <em>(Eu))</em></p>\n<p id=\"b948-7\">Finally, as a reviewing court is directed to look at the arguments contained in the official ballot pamphlet to ascertain voter intent, it is well settled that such an analysis necessarily includes the arguments advanced by both the proponents and opponents of the initiative. <em>(Eu, supra, </em>54 Cal.3d at pp. 504-505.)  Here, the opponent\u2019s rebuttal to the argument in favor of Proposition 21 specifically made the voters aware that Proposition 21 would enhance the punishment of gang-related misdemeanors: \u201cProposition 21 is NOT LIMITED TO VIOLENT CRIME. <em>It turns low-level vandalism into a felony. It requires gang offenders with misdemeanors (like stealing candy) to serve six months in jail. </em>SHERIFF Mike Hennessey (S.F.) says, T support tough laws against gangs and crime, but Proposition 21 is the WRONG APPROACH.\u2019\u201d (Ballot Pamp., Primary Elec. (Mar. 7, 2000) rebuttal to argument in favor of Prop. 21, p. 48, italics added.)<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b948-8\">Fairly read, opponents warned that the passage of Proposition 21, section 186.22(d) would turn vandalism <em>under </em>$400 (a misdemeanor) into a felony, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"907\">*907</page-number>and would make gang-related misdemeanor petty theft subject to a minimum six-month sentence.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> But the voters passed the initiative despite these warnings. Thus, the ballot materials clearly show that the voters intended to dramatically increase the punishment for <em>all </em>gang-related crime,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> and specifically contemplated that all misdemeanors would be included within the ambit of section 186.22(d).<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b949-5\">Indeed, the electorate\u2019s intent to punish all gang crime more severely would be undermined if section 186.22(d) applied only to wobblers, and not to all misdemeanors, because section 186.22(d) provides for lower punishment than many, if not all, wobbler crimes that are charged as felonies.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b949-6\">For example, where the wobbler is assault with a deadly weapon other than a firearm (\u00a7 245, subd. (a)(1)), and the crime is charged as a felony, section 245, subdivision (a)(1) provides a sentence of two, three, or four years in state prison. In addition, if such assault was committed for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"908\">*908</page-number>benefit of a gang, the prosecutor could also charge the section 186.22, subdivision (b)(1) enhancement in order to add a minimum of two, three, or four years to that sentence, and as much as five or 10 years in prison.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Yet, were this same gang-related assault charged under section 186.22(d), which operates to the exclusion of section 186.22, subdivision (b)(1),<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> the defendant\u2019s maximum sentence would be three years. Thus, if section 186.22(d) were limited to wobblers, the statute\u2019s only effect would be to <em>reduce </em>the punishment for gang-related crime. But the electorate clearly did not intend this result. Instead, the electorate intended that section 186.22(d) increase the punishment for gang-related misdemeanors.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b950-4\">4. <em>Absurd Results</em></p>\n<p id=\"b950-5\">Petitioner contends that application of section 186.22(d) to all misdemeanors and all felonies, instead of wobblers only, would lead to absurd results because it would allow prosecutors to charge a gang-related murder, mayhem, or rape under the \u201call felonies\u201d rubric of section 186.22(d). Such a result, petitioner contends, would be contrary to the intent of the voters, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"909\">*909</page-number>because they wanted gang crime to be punished more severely, not more leniently.</p>\n<p id=\"b951-5\">This argument is without merit. In <em>People v. Garcia </em>(1999) 21 Cal.4th 1, 14 [87 Cal.Rptr.2d 114, 980 P.2d 829], in interpreting a section of the \u201cThree Strikes\u201d initiative, we stated that \u201cFor purposes of interpreting these statutes ... it matters not whether the drafters, voters or legislators consciously considered all the effects and interrelationships of the provisions they wrote and enacted. We must take the language ... as it was passed into law, and must, . . . without doing violence to the language and spirit of the law, interpret it so as to harmonize and give effect to all its provisions.\u201d (Fn. omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b951-6\">While it is <em>possible </em>that a prosecutor might file a murder, mayhem or rape charge exclusively under section 186.22(d), this is an unintended consequence that would rarely, if ever, occur. (See, e.g., <em>In re Executive Life Ins. Co. </em>(1995) 32 Cal.App.4th 344, 373 [38 Cal.Rptr.2d 453] [while the failure to consider a statute\u2019s consequences may be unwise, a \u201ccourt may not [freely] substitute its personally perceived wisdom\u201d \u201cbecause the field of unintended consequences approaches the infinite\u201d].) Nothing in Proposition 21 requires that the prosecution make such a choice and, to the contrary, section 37 of Proposition 21 provides that \u201c[i]t is the intent of the people of the State of California in enacting this measure that if any provision in this act conflicts with another section of law which provides for a greater penalty or longer period of imprisonment that <em>the latter provision shall apply </em>. . . .\u201d (Ballot Pamp., Primary Elec. (Mar. 7, 2000) text of Prop. 21, \u00a7 37, p. 131, italics added.)  As stated by the Court of Appeal, \u201c[w]e presume prosecutors will exercise their charging discretion in a manner that is consistent with the will of the electorate and the goal of achieving substantial justice.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b951-7\">III. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b951-8\">In <em>Hodges v. Superior Court </em>(1999) 21 Cal.4th 109, 114 [86 Cal.Rptr.2d 884, 980 P.2d 433], we stated that \u201c[i]n the case of a voters\u2019 initiative statute ... we may not properly interpret the measure in a way that the electorate did not contemplate: the voters should get what they enacted, not more and not less.\u201d Section 186.22(d) enables prosecutors to more severely punish gang-related misdemeanors. This is the very result the voters intended when passing Proposition 21, not more and not less.</p>\n<p id=\"b951-9\">The judgment of the Court of Appeal is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b951-10\">George, C.

[Citation.] When the language is ambiguous, \u2018we refer to other indicia of the voters\u2019 intent, particularly the analyses and arguments contained in the official ballot pamphlet.\u2019 \u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Rizo </em>(2000) 22 Cal.4th 681, 685 [94 Cal.Rptr.2d 375, 996 P.2d 27].)</p>\n<p id=\"b953-7\">Here, section 186.22(d)\u2019s phrase \u201cconvicted of a public offense punishable as a felony or a misdemeanor\u201d is ambiguous: It can be read either as applying only to wobblers or as referring to all misdemeanors and all felonies. But when section 186.22(d) is read together with subdivision (b)(1) of section 186.22 (section 186.22(b)(1)), it becomes apparent that section 186.22(d) can only apply to wobblers.</p>\n<p id=\"b953-8\">Under the majority\u2019s interpretation of section 186.22(d), a defendant who is convicted of a felony and is found to have committed the crime to benefit a criminal street gang will be sentenced to a prison term of <em>one year, two years, or three years. </em>But (except for a couple of rarely used exceptions) the prison term for even the most minor felonies is <em>16 months, two years, or three </em>years, a sentence <em>greater than </em>(for the lower term) or equal to (for the middle and upper terms), the sentence specified in section 186.22(d). Most serious felonies, of course, carry even greater sentences. Moreover, Proposition 21 also amended section 186.22(b)(1) to provide, in words identical to those of section 186.22(d), that any person who commits a felony to benefit a criminal street gang must be punished by an added penalty of <em>two, three, or four </em>years in prison, a penalty <em>greater than </em>the sentence described in section 186.22(d).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Thus, if the majority is right that in the phrase \u201cconvicted of a public offense punishable as a felony or a misdemeanor,\u201d the words \u201ca felony\u201d refer to all felonies, then those two words are meaningless: No <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"912\">*912</page-number>prosecutor will allege a violation of section 186.22(d) in any felony case, because it provides for felony sentences <em>lower </em>than those prescribed elsewhere in the Penal Code, including those required in another part of the <em>same law.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b954-4\">The words \u201ca felony\u201d are not the only ones that are made meaningless by construing section 186.22(d), as the majority does, as applying to all felonies and misdemeanors. That provision pertains to persons \u201cconvicted of <em>a public offense punishable as </em>a felony or a misdemeanor.\u201d (Italics added.) Under the construction given by the majority\u2014that the phrase refers to all felonies and misdemeanors\u2014the drafters of Proposition 21 could have simply omitted the italicized words without affecting the meaning given by the majority.</p>\n<p id=\"b954-5\">The majority\u2019s interpretation violates a basic tenet of statutory construction that whenever possible, significance must be given to every word in ascertaining legislative intent, avoiding any construction that renders some words surplusage. <em>(Agnew </em>v. <em>State Bd. of Equalization </em>(1999) 21 Cal.4th 310, 330 [87 Cal.Rptr.2d 423, 981 P.2d 52]; see also <em>Cooley v. Superior Court </em>(2002) 29 Cal.4th 228, 249 [127 Cal.Rptr.2d 177, 57 P.3d 654]; <em>Navellier v. Slettin </em>(2002) 29 Cal.4th 82, 95 [124 Cal.Rptr.2d 530, 52 P.3d 703].) By contrast, to construe section 186.22(d) as applying only to wobblers, as I would, gives meaning to all the statutory language. That provision\u2019s phrase \u201ca public offense punishable as a felony or a misdemeanor\u201d is a simplified version of language used elsewhere in the Penal Code to describe a wobbler. (See \u00a7 17, subd. (b) [\u201ca crime . . . punishable, in the discretion of the court, by imprisonment in the state prison or by fine or imprisonment in the county jail . . . .\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b954-6\">According to the majority, \u201c[b]y its plain language . . . section 186.22(d) applies to any crime or public offense that is a felony or a misdemeanor.\u201d (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 901.) The statutory language, read in a commonsense manner, refers to wobblers because, as explained above, that is the only construction that gives meaning to all the statutory language. The majority offers no explanation for its claim that, looking only at the words themselves, section 186.22(d) refers to all felonies and misdemeanors.</p>\n<p id=\"b954-7\">The majority maintains that if section 186.22(d) was intended to apply only to wobblers, it would have contained specific language expressly saying so, such as a reference to section 17 (which describes a wobbler), or words that mirrored section 17\u2019s description of a wobbler. (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at pp. 901-902.) One can just as easily argue that if section 186.22(d) was intended to apply to all felonies and misdemeanors, it would have contained specific language saying so. When, as here, a statute is ambiguous, one can <em>always </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"913\">*913</page-number>assert that the drafters could have avoided the ambiguity by adding unambiguous language.</p>\n<p id=\"b955-5\">The majority claims its holding \u201cis buttressed when one considers that the term \u2018wobbler\u2019 does not have a meaning defined by statute or commonly understood by the electorate.\u201d (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 902.) That assertion is puzzling. The word \u201cwobbler\u201d does not appear in section 186.22(d) and its meaning is thus not in issue. True, \u201cwobbler\u201d is not statutorily defined and is not used in common parlance, but so what? Section 186.22(b) contains no reference to wobblers. But it does contain the phrase \u201ca public offense punishable as a felony or a misdemeanor,\u201d which is, as noted earlier, language accurately describing a wobbler.</p>\n<p id=\"b955-6\">The majority cites the arguments and analyses in the ballot pamphlet presented to the voters to support its conclusion that section 186.22(d) applies to all felonies and misdemeanors, not just wobblers. (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at pp. 903-908.) First, the majority notes that the Legislative Analysis of Proposition 21 said that the proposition \u201c \u2018[increases penalties for gang-related crimes and requires gang members to register with local law enforcement agencies.\u2019 \u201d (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 906.) There is no dispute that one of the purposes of Proposition 21 was to impose stiffer penalties on gang-related crimes. But that point is irrelevant to the issue whether section 186.22(d) applies to all felonies and misdemeanors or only to wobblers.</p>\n<p id=\"b955-7\">Next, the majority points out that the <em>opponents </em>of Proposition 21 said that it \u201c \u2018turns low-level vandalism into a felony\u2019 \u201d and \u201c \u2018requires gang offenders with misdemeanors (like stealing candy) to serve six months in jail.\u2019 \u201d (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 906, italics omitted.) According to the majority, the vandalism argument is \u201cfairly read\u201d <em>(ibid.) </em>as warning that Proposition 21 would turn relatively minor crimes, such as gang-related vandalism causing damage of less than $400, into felonies, and the candy example warned the voters that such a minor crime would trigger the harsh penalty of a six-month sentence for gang-related petty theft. Thus, the majority reasons, the voters were on notice that section 186.22(d) would apply to all misdemeanors and felonies, and that they must therefore have intended this result in passing Proposition 21.</p>\n<p id=\"b955-8\">Once again, the majority seizes on arguments that have nothing to do with the issue before us. The opponents\u2019 statement that Proposition 21 \u201cturns low-level vandalism into a felony\u201d refers not to section 186.22(d), but to Proposition 21\u2019s proposed change in the <em>vandalism </em>law. Before Proposition 21, vandalism (\u00a7 594) was a misdemeanor unless the value of the damage exceeded five <em>thousand </em>dollars. (Stats. 1999, ch. 83, \u00a7 144.) Proposition 21 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"914\">*914</page-number>amended section 594 to permit felony prosecution for vandalism when the damage exceeds four <em>hundred </em>dollars. It is this change in the vandalism law that the opponents were addressing when they told the voters that Proposition 21 \u201cturns low-level vandalism into a felony.\u201d (Ballot Pamp., Primary Elec. (Mar. 7, 2000) rebuttal to argument in favor of Prop. 21, p. 48.)</p>\n<p id=\"b956-4\">With respect to the opponents\u2019 candy argument, the majority is wrong when it reads the opponents\u2019 argument as implicitly saying that section 186.22(d) applies to all misdemeanors. Even if applicable only to wobblers, the provision would nonetheless apply to a theft of candy if the offender had a prior conviction for shoplifting (\u00a7 666), if the offender was convicted of second degree burglary (\u00a7\u00a7 459, 461), or in the unlikely event that the value of the candy exceeded $400 (\u00a7\u00a7 487, subd. (a), 489, subd. (b)).</p>\n<p id=\"b956-5\">The majority conveniently overlooks the argument by the <em>proponents </em>of Proposition 21 that the proposition \u201cdoesn\u2019t lock up kids for minor offenses.\u201d (Ballot Pamp., Primary Elec. (Mar. 7, 2000) rebuttal to argument against Prop. 21, p. 49.) Contrary to that claim, the majority construes section 186.22(d) as mandating a <em>minimum </em>sentence of six months in jail and a maximum of three years in prison for <em>all </em>gang-related misdemeanors, no matter how insignificant. For example, a defendant convicted of driving with an expired license (Veh. Code, \u00a7 12500) will, under the majority\u2019s interpretation, have to serve at least six months in jail and could receive up to three years in prison if passengers in the car are members of a criminal street gang and the jury finds that the defendant drove the car for their benefit. The voters, when they enacted Proposition 21, were assured by the proponents that the initiative would not impose such draconian penalties.</p>\n<p id=\"b956-6\">Construed as applying only to wobblers, section 186.22(d) has a plausible purpose: To limit the power of trial courts to impose light sentences on defendants who commit gang-related wobblers. When a defendant is convicted of a wobbler charged as a felony with a gang enhancement under <em>subdivision (b) </em>of section 186.22, a trial court wishing to show leniency may reduce the wobbler to a misdemeanor and impose a short jail sentence. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(Alvarez) (1997) 14 Cal.4th 968 [60 Cal.Rptr.2d 93, 928 P.2d 1171] [when defendant convicted of a wobbler charged as a felony, trial court may avoid the three strikes penalty provision by reducing the crime to a misdemeanor].) Section 186.22(d) limits the trial court\u2019s power to exercise leniency in the fashion described above: If the court elects to treat the crime as a misdemeanor, section 186.22(d) requires it to sentence the defendant to a minimum of six months in county jail. In my view, it was to achieve this purpose that the voters amended section 186.22 to add subdivision (d).</p>\n<p id=\"b957-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"915\">*915</page-number>Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b957-5\">The majority asserts that the <em>only </em>purpose of section 186.22(d) is to \u201cenable[] prosecutors to more severely punish gang-related <em>misdemeanors.\u201d </em>(Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 909, italics added.) This cannot be true. If the voters\u2019 sole purpose was to punish gang-related <em>misdemeanants </em>more severely, why did they enact a law that, by its terms, applies to those convicted of crimes punishable \u201cas a <em>felony </em>or a misdemeanor?\u201d (Italics added.) The majority does not, and cannot, answer this question. The only construction of section 186.22(d) that gives meaning to all the statutory language is to read it as applying only to wobblers, as I propose to do. I would therefore reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeal, which held that petitioner could be prosecuted under section 186.22(d) based on his commission of a misdemeanor.</p>\n<p id=\"b957-6\">Petitioner\u2019s petition for a rehearing was denied August 20, 2003, and the opinion was modified to read as printed above.
