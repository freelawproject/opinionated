It is for the factfinder to determine, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>with guidance from this Court, whether Cedric Fleming\u2019s facial disfigurement is \u201csevere\u201d enough to constitute a \u201cgrave injury.\u201d <em>(Fitzpatrick v Chase Manhattan Bank, </em>285 AD2d 487; <em>Rubeis v Aqua Club, Inc., </em>3 NY3d 408; <em>Dietrick v Kemper Ins.

II. The issue of liability is not properly before this Court. Thus, the Appellate Division correctly affirmed the denial of Pinstripes Garment Services, LLC\u2019s motion. In any event, even if this Court considered Pinstripes\u2019 arguments on liability on their merits, Pinstripes is still not entitled to summary judgment. <em>(Herrick v Second Cuthouse, </em>64 NY2d 692; <em>Patrician Plastic Corp. v Bernadel Realty Corp., </em>25 NY2d 599; <em>Calemine v Hobler, </em>263 AD2d 495; <em>Bogorad v Fitzpatrick, </em>38 AD2d 923, 31 NY2d 984; <em>Young v Mauch, </em>268 AD2d 583; <em>Thomas v Holzberg, </em>300 AD2d 10; <em>Canceleno v Johnston, </em>264 AD2d 405; <em>Bagnato v Romano, </em>179 AD2d 713; <em>Shea v Judson, </em>283 NY 393; <em>Galvin v Zacholl, </em>302 AD2d 965.)</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b336-5\">OPINION OF THE COURT</p>\n<author id=\"b336-6\">Jones, J.</author>\n<p id=\"b336-7\">The issue in this case is whether plaintiffs facial injuries constituted a \u201cpermanent and severe facial disfigurement\u201d for purposes of qualifying as a \u201cgrave injury\u201d under Workers\u2019 Compensation Law \u00a7 11. Under the facts of this case, we hold that they do not.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-8\">Following a collision between a van driven by a Pinstripes Garment Services, LLC employee and a school bus driven by an employee of Evergreen Bus Service, Inc., plaintiff Cedric Fleming (a Pinstripes employee and passenger in the van) sustained multiple facial injuries resulting in scars on his forehead and right upper eyelid. Fleming sued Evergreen and its bus driver for negligence. Evergreen commenced a third-party action against Pinstripes for common-law indemnity and/or contribution pursuant to Workers\u2019 Compensation Law \u00a7 11 on the theory that Fleming sustained a \u201cpermanent and severe facial disfigurement.\u201d Pinstripes subsequently moved for summary judgment dismissing the third-party complaint on the ground that Fleming\u2019s injuries were not \u201cgrave.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b336-9\">Supreme Court denied Pinstripes\u2019 motion, concluding that questions of fact existed. The court relied on an unsworn report <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>of the first-party defendant\u2019s expert who opined that some of Fleming\u2019s scars could not be improved. The court also stated that Fleming\u2019s \u201cnumerous facial scars . . . [were] plainly visible to the observer\u201d (2005 NY Slip Op 30268[U], *8). The Appellate Division affirmed, concluding that photographs of Fleming\u2019s face \u201cdid not clearly show that [his] facial scarring was not a severe facial disfigurement\u201d <em>(Fleming v Graham, </em>34 AD3d 525, 527 [2d Dept 2006]). We now reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-5\">Absent an express indemnification agreement, or a \u201cgrave injury\u201d as enumerated in Workers\u2019 Compensation Law \u00a7 11,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> an employer\u2019s liability for an employee\u2019s on-the-job injury is ordinarily limited to workers\u2019 compensation benefits <em>(see Tonking v Port Auth. of N.Y. &amp; N.J., </em>3 NY3d 486, 490 [2004]). Where a \u201cgrave injury\u201d results, a primary defendant may commence a third-party action against the injured plaintiffs employer for common-law indemnification and/or contribution. This case requires us to articulate a standard for assessing claims of \u201cpermanent and severe facial disfigurement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b337-6\">Our analysis begins and ends with the legislative goal of the Omnibus Workers\u2019 Compensation Reform Act of 1996, which enacted the third paragraph of section 11. Before 1996, first-party defendants were free to implead an injured plaintiff\u2019s employer in a personal injury action for \u201cunlimited contribution or indemnification\u201d (Governor\u2019s Approval Mem, Bill Jacket, L 1996, ch 635, at 54). Allowing such unfettered third-party actions undermined the employer\u2019s reliance upon workers\u2019 compensation benefits as its exclusive liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-7\">The purpose of the 1996 legislation was \u201cto reduce costs for employers while also protecting the interests of injured workers\u201d <em>(Rubeis v Aqua Club, Inc., </em>3 NY3d 408, 415 [2004]). Section 11 thus serves to protect employers by barring third-party <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>actions against them \u201cexcept in <em>extremely </em>limited, defined circumstances\u201d <em>(Castro v United Container Mach. Group, </em>96 NY2d 398, 402 [2001] [emphasis added]; <em>see also </em>Minkowitz, Practice Commentaries, McKinney\u2019s Cons Laws of NY, Book 64, Workers\u2019 Compensation Law \u00a7 11, at 444 [\u201cSection 11 was written with the obvious, deliberate intention of ensuring preservation of the concept of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Law being the employer\u2019s exclusive liability to its employees\u201d]). The categories of grave injuries listed in section 11, providing the sole bases for a third-party action, \u201care deliberately both <em>narrowly and completely </em>described\u201d; the list, both \u201cexhaustive\u201d and \u201cnot illustrative,\u201d is \u201cnot intended to be extended absent further legislative action\u201d (Governor\u2019s Approval Mem at 55 [emphasis added]).</p>\n<p id=\"b338-5\">What constitutes \u201cpermanent and severe facial disfigurement\u201d is unlike most of the other enumerated \u201cgrave\u201d injuries, which are, on the whole, amenable to \u201cobjectively ascertainable\u201d determinations as a matter of law <em>(Rubeis, </em>3 NY3d at 417; see <em>also Meis v ELO Org., </em>97 NY2d 714, 716 [2002] [loss of thumb is not a \u201cpermanent and total loss of use\u201d of a hand]; <em>Castro, </em>96 NY2d at 401 [\u201c Toss of multiple fingers\u2019 cannot sensibly be read to mean partial loss of multiple fingers\u201d]). Generally, courts have been able to conclusively say, one way or the other, whether an injury is or is not so \u201csevere\u201d for section 11 purposes <em>(see e.g. Rosen v Nygren Dahly Co., </em>1 AD3d 998, 998 [4th Dept 2003] [minor facial scarring insufficient as a matter of law]; <em>Krollman v Food Automation Serv. Techniques, Inc., </em>13 AD3d 1209, 1210 [4th Dept 2004] [three-millimeter scar above eyebrow and \u201csome mottling of her cheeks\u201d insufficient]; <em>Giblin v Pine Ridge Log Homes, Inc., </em>42 AD3d 705, 707 [3d Dept 2007] [loss of eye, though a permanent condition, not a severe disfigurement where use of prosthesis leaves only negligible alteration in facial appearance]). However, these determinations have been rendered without the aid of a reliable, fairly predictable legal guidepost.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-6\">In construing the statute we follow two fundamental principles: first, we implement the intent of the Legislature. Second, we construe statutory words in light of \u201ctheir plain meaning without resort to -forced or unnatural interpretations\u201d <em>(Castro, </em>96 NY2d at 401). The statutory purpose of section 11, as explained above, is clear. Turning to the critical statutory words, we note initially that permanency and severity are both conditions precedent to a finding of \u201cfacial disfigurement.\u201d With <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>competent medical evidence, a court may generally determine whether a facial disfigurement is permanent. Severity presents a different inquiry. Consistent with the legislative intent behind section 11, we conclude that \u201cseverity\u201d implies a highly limited class of disfiguring injuries beyond minor scarring or lacerations.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-5\">\u201cSevere\u201d is variously defined as something \u201c[clausing sharp discomfort or distress\u201d (American Heritage Dictionary 1248 [3d ed 2000]) or something \u201c[e]xtremely intense,\u201d as in <em>\u201csevere </em>pain\u201d (Webster\u2019s II New College Dictionary 1012 [1995]; <em>see also </em>Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary, Unabridged [2008] [something \u201cof <em>a great </em>degree or an undesirable or harmful extent\u201d (emphasis added)]). Plainly, the specification of \u201csevere\u201d in the statute points to the greater end of the disfigurement spectrum <em>(see Blackburn v Wysong &amp; Miles Co., </em>11 AD3d 421, 422 [2d Dept 2004] [\u201c(g)rave injury is a statutorily-defined threshold for <em>catastrophic </em>injuries\u201d (emphasis added)]).</p>\n<p id=\"b339-6\">As for \u201cdisfigurement,\u201d one definition seems to capture the essence of the word well: \u201cthat which impairs or injures the beauty, symmetry or appearance of a person or thing; that which renders unsightly, misshapen or imperfect or deforms in some manner\u201d <em>(Pilato v Nigel </em>Enters., <em>Inc., </em>48 AD3d 1133, 1135-1136 [4th Dept 2008]; <em>see also Giblin, </em>42 AD3d at 707; <em>Superior Min. Co. v Industrial Commn., </em>309 Ill. 339, 340-341, 141 NE 165 [1923]).</p>\n<p id=\"b339-7\">While no conceivable standard can capture in toto the highly limited class of \u201csevere\u201d facial disfigurements contemplated by section 11, we nonetheless conclude that an injury disfigures the face when it detrimentally alters the plaintiff\u2019s natural beauty, symmetry or appearance, or otherwise deforms. A disfigurement is severe if a reasonable person viewing the plaintiffs face in its altered state would regard the condition as abhorrently distressing, highly objectionable, shocking or extremely unsightly. In finding that a disfigurement is severe, plaintiffs injury must greatly alter the appearance of the face from its appearance before the accident. The foregoing standard, ordinarily one for the court as a matter of law, removes the inquiry from plaintiffs subjective self-assessment and most closely approximates what the Legislature contemplated.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-8\">In this case, Pinstripes demonstrated that no material issue of fact remains and it is thus entitled to summary judgment on the basis that Fleming did not sustain a permanent and severe <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>facial disfigurement <em>(see Cox v Kingsboro Med. Group, </em>88 NY2d 904, 906 [1996]). The photographs in the record show numerous scars. However, they demonstrate a steady progression from the initial injuries to scarring, to significant recovery. Although first-party defendant\u2019s expert implied that Fleming\u2019s scars are permanent, his report indicated that revisions were possible. Even aside from the evidentiary value of the report and, indeed, the question of permanency, whether Fleming\u2019s disfigurement is \u201csevere\u201d remains for us to decide. While in some cases that question is one properly for the factfinder, we determine that, on the facts of this case, Fleming\u2019s injuries do not rise to the level of a \u201csevere\u201d disfigurement. Although there are cases where a reasonable person might view multiple scarring as satisfying the standard we articulate here, this is not one of them.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-5\">Accordingly, the Appellate Division order should be reversed, with costs, third-party defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment dismissing the third-party complaint granted and the certified question answered in the negative.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-6\">Chief Judge Kaye and Judges Ciparick, Graffeo, Read, Smith and Pigott concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-7\">Order reversed, etc.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b337-8\"> Section 11 states, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-9\">\u201cAn employer shall not be liable for contribution or indemnity to any third person based upon liability for injuries sustained by an employee acting within the scope of his or her employment for such employer unless such third person proves through competent medical evidence that such employee has sustained a \u2018grave injury\u2019 which shall mean <em>only one or more of the following-, </em>death, permanent and total loss of use or amputation of an arm, leg, hand or foot, loss of multiple fingers, loss of\" multiple toes, paraplegia or quadriplegia, total and permanent blindness, total and permanent deafness, loss of nose, loss of ear, <em>permanent and severe facial disfigurement, </em>loss of an index finger or an acquired injury to the brain caused by an external physical force resulting in permanent total disability\u201d (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
