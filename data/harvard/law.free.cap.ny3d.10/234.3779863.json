We hold that damages in this case should be awarded in line with the formula set out in <em>Village of Highland Falls v State of New York </em>(44 NY2d 505 [1978])\u2014i.e., the rental value of the land encompassed within the temporary easement for so long as the easement is in effect plus, as consequential damages, the rental value of the parcel\u2019s unencumbered interior acreage for any period of time when highway access was not possible by virtue of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>the easement\u2019s use. A condemnee is entitled to consequential damages comprising the rental value of the parcel\u2019s unencumbered interior acreage for the easement\u2019s duration only if the condemnor does not meet its burden of proving the interval of actual obstruction, or the condemnee establishes that the mere existence of the temporary easement did, in fact, impede sale or development of the property for its highest and best use. Here, the condemnor, the State of New York, met its burden, while claimant Brian R. McCurdy, the condemnee, did not show that the temporary easement thwarted the highest and best use of his property. The award must therefore be vacated, and, upon remittal, the Court of Claims should calculate consequential damages and interest in conformity with our decision in <em>Village of Highland Falls.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b274-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-6\">In 1980, claimant purchased a vacant, unimproved parcel of land in the Town of Islip. The parcel, comprising 10,888 square feet (0.25 acres) and shaped like a parallelogram, is 150 feet deep with 75 feet of frontage on the north side of the Montauk Highway (State Route 27A), a heavily traveled four-lane east/ west thoroughfare. The property is a cleared, level, grassy plot at road grade, and is zoned for residential use; it neighbors a comparably sized and shaped parcel located on the corner of the Montauk Highway and Pease Lane, a north/south road. Claimant is a dentist whose office is located in a two-story wood frame structure on this adjoining parcel.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-7\">In April 1999, the State of New York, in connection with a highway reconstruction project, permanently appropriated a 71-square-foot slice of claimant\u2019s land abutting the Montauk Highway. This slice, which was about 2.5 feet deep at the southeastern corner of claimant\u2019s parcel, tapered to meet the property line midway along its border with the highway. For grading purposes, the State also acquired a temporary easement over a 679-square-foot strip of land that spanned the entire front of the parcel to a depth of roughly 10 feet. The temporary easement read as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b274-8\">\u201cTEMPORARY EASEMENT FOR GRADING</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b274-9\">\u201cA temporary easement to be exercised in, on and over the property above delineated for the purpose of grading for use and exercisable during the construction of the highway and terminating upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>approval of the completed work, unless sooner terminated or deemed no longer necessary for highway purposes and released by the Commissioner of Transportation. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b275-5\">\u201cRESERVING, however, to the owner of any right, title, or interest in and to the property mapped above and such owner\u2019s successors or assigns, the right of using said property and such use shall not be further limited or restricted under this easement beyond that which is necessary to effectuate its purposes for, and as established by, the construction, and as so constructed, the maintenance, of the herein identified project.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b275-6\">These permanent and temporary takings allowed the State to repave the highway; install concrete curbing, a sidewalk, a driveway apron and a decorative brick utility strip; and relocate a fire hydrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-7\">Claimant timely commenced a proceeding in the Court of Claims to seek damages resulting from the partial appropriation and the taking of the temporary easement. At trial, the parties stipulated that the damages for the permanent taking in fee amounted to $850; the land value of the property both before and after the appropriation was $8.75 per square foot; the vesting date for both the taking in fee and the temporary easement was April 7, 1999; the temporary easement terminated on February 1, 2001; and claimant owned the parcel on the vesting and expiration dates. They disputed only how to calculate consequential damages for the temporary easement. Claimant contended that, in light of the Appellate Division\u2019s decision in <em>Matter of Kadlec v State of New York </em>(264 AD2d 420 [2d Dept 1999]), which involved an identically worded temporary easement encumbering a vacant parcel\u2019s entire highway frontage, the State was required to pay the rental value for the whole parcel for the full period of time the easement was in effect, regardless of whether or for how long access to the Montauk Highway was actually obstructed; the State countered that it was obligated to award consequential damages for the parcel\u2019s unencumbered interior acreage only for those days when access was, in fact, blocked.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-8\">Claimant\u2019s appraiser testified that the highest and best use of the property was to develop it \u201cas a single tenant medical office building which would be in character with the surrounding properties\u201d because \u201c[a]s other parcels have been rezoned, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>there\u2019s been a transition in the neighborhood from residences] to GST zoning which would permit offices\u201d: there was a hospital nearby and \u201cmany of the properties along Montauk Highway for a half a mile east and west [had been] improved with converted homes and one-story office and two-story office buildings, attended by medical uses.\u201d Claimant\u2019s appraiser opined that the Town would likely grant a request for the necessary rezoning; however, so long as the State\u2019s temporary easement was in place \u201ca developer would not be interested in developing [the subject] property . . . because they [had] absolutely no way to enter into [it]\u201d since \u201c[t]here was no access via any other means . . . than [the] Montauk Highway.\u201d While development of the parcel as a single-tenant medical office building would concededly also require the Town to approve a variance from the zoning ordinance\u2019s minimum yard width (100 feet), claimant\u2019s appraiser offered no opinion as to the likelihood of this happening; when pressed, she acknowledged that her report cited no examples where the owner of a parcel had obtained relief from both the relevant zoning and yard-width requirements. She testified that 12% was the proper rate of return on the property\u2019s land value for purposes of calculating rental value.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">The State called an employee of the New York State Department of Transportation (DOT), who testified that, upon searching DOT\u2019S records from 1983 forward, she found no highway work permit authorizing claimant to construct an entrance connecting the parcel to the Montauk Highway <em>(see </em>Highway Law \u00a7 52 [generally requiring a permit prior to construction or improvement within a state highway right-of-way]). In addition, the veteran DOT engineer in charge of the project testified that claimant\u2019s parcel had been, in fact, physically accessible from the Montauk Highway while the temporary easement was in effect except for a period of 7 to 10 days. Further, claimant could have obtained access upon request during those 7 to 10 days since DOT would have accommodated him \u201c[b]y staging construction so that only a portion of the frontage of the property [was] encumbered at any one time.\u201d Finally, the DOT engineer testified that equipment and materials were never stored on the temporary easement because this would have created \u201ca safety hazard,\u201d and the contractor maintained a staging area elsewhere.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-6\">Next, portions of claimant\u2019s deposition testimony were read into the record. These excerpts established that claimant did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>not own the property on the corner of Pease Lane and the Montauk Highway where his dental office was located; that \u201cMuring the entire time . . . [he] owned\u201d the subject parcel, there was never a structure on it; that \u201cin conjunction with [his] dental office! ]\u201d cars were \u201csometimes\u201d parked on the parcel, but these cars \u201center[ed] off Pease Lane\u201d rather than from the Montauk Highway; that he had never \u201capplied to any governmental agency for a permit to develop [the parcel]\u201d; and that, prior to the taking and the acquisition of the temporary easement, he did not \u201cmake it a custom and habit to drive onto the [parcel] from [the] Montauk Highway.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b277-4\">Finally, the State called an appraiser to rebut claimant\u2019s appraiser\u2019s testimony. He pointed out that the temporary easement expressly reserved to claimant the right to use the property except as necessary for DOT to construct and maintain the project. In addition, he noted that there was no evidence of denial of access, or of any use of the easement other than for grading. Based upon these considerations, the State\u2019s appraiser opined that claimant\u2019s remainder property was available for development during the temporary easement\u2019s term. In response to questioning by the trial court, however, he conceded that \u201c[i]f there was a denial of access during the construction period, then . . . that would negatively impact the property.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b277-5\">In its subsequent decision, the Court of Claims accepted claimant\u2019s theory of consequential damages, and so awarded him the rental value of the entire remainder property for the easement\u2019s duration, plus statutory interest. The trial court\u2019s decision was based entirely on <em>Kadlec, </em>which he interpreted as affording no leeway to favor the State\u2019s \u201cfact-based analysis (i.e. Claimant never attempted to develop the subject property or apply for a highway work permit) or the opinion of its expert that the temporary easement did not prevent Claimant from accessing the subject.\u201d To the contrary, \u201cwhere as here\u2014and as in Kadlec\u2014a subject\u2019s only access to a public roadway is compromised by an easement running the entire length of that frontage, the Court <em>must </em>find that access is denied and development impaired, resulting in a de facto taking\u201d (emphasis added). The Appellate Division subsequently affirmed on the rationale that \u201c[t]he record supports . . . that the temporary easement . . . rendered the claimant\u2019s remaining property inaccessible and, thus, unavailable for development for the period of time that the temporary easement was in existence\u201d <em>(McCurdy v State of New York, </em>37 AD3d 779, 781 [2d Dept 2007]). We subsequently granted the State leave to appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>II.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-5\">In <em>Village of Highland Falls, </em>the Court of Claims awarded the rental value of the claimant\u2019s property for the entire duration of the temporary easement (the precise measure adopted by the lower courts in this case), but the Appellate Division modified and reduced the award to the rental value of the claimant\u2019s property for the three days in which its use was actually interrupted by the State\u2019s easement (the precise measure of damages urged by the State here). The property in question was improved by a municipal water treatment facility, which occupied a portion of the tract subject to the temporary easement.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-6\">We affirmed the Appellate Division, stating that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b278-7\">\u201c[t]he general rule is that property taken in eminent domain is to be valued prospectively from the time of appropriation ....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b278-8\">\u201cWhen a temporary easement, contemplating only incidental and contingent use, is appropriated, rather than a permanent interest, however, it may be somewhat more acceptable to permit the use of hindsight in valuing the interest taken. <em>If the condemnation award is made after the easement has expired, it makes practical sense to compute the property owner\u2019s actual damages rather than indulging in speculation on the measure of damages claimant could have contemplated at the time of </em>taking\u201d (44 NY2d at 508 [citations omitted and emphasis added]).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b278-9\">In adopting a retrospective measure of damages, we observed that \u201c[i]t has been held by this court . . . that compensation need not be paid for the State\u2019s taking of a temporary easement when there is no actual interference with the property owner\u2019s use of his property\u201d (44 NY2d at 507, citing <em>Great Atl. &amp; Pac. Tea Co. v State of New York, </em>22 NY2d 75, 87 [1968]). We found \u201cinsufficient reason for abandoning [the above] precedent\u201d where a three-year-long temporary easement connected to highway improvements gave the State \u201cthe legal right to exercise some sort of dominion throughout the period of the easement,\u201d but, in fact, the claimant\u2019s \u201coperation of the water treatment facility was rarely significantly interrupted\u201d (44 NY2d at 507, 508). Similarly, in this case (and unlike the situation in <em>Kadlec), </em>the State proved the interval of actual obstruction; i.e., it is undisputed that highway access to claimant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>parcel was obstructed for only 7 to 10 days (and the State concedes 10 days for purposes of the appeal) during the 666 days the easement was in effect (from April 7, 1999 to February 1, 2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b279-5\">We added a caveat in <em>Village of Highland Falls, </em>however, commenting that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b279-6\">\u201c[n]ot to be ignored . . . although not always measurable, is the damage to a property owner caused by uncertainty regarding the condemnor\u2019s intentions. A temporary easement that leaves the property owner under constant threat that his use of the property may be curtailed or stopped is likely to affect business or other financial decisions even if use is never interrupted in fact. The threat imposed by the condemnor\u2019s legal right to occupy may be almost as damaging as the actual occupation of the property. Damages caused by such uncertainty, difficult as they may be to measure, should generally be compensable\u201d (44 NY2d at 509).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b279-7\">Claimant implicitly relies on this dictum. He contends that the temporary easement rendered his property unmarketable and undevelopable for its highest and best use as a single-tenant medical office building because it cut off highway access for an indefinite and unspecified period of time. This argument, however, ignores the easement\u2019s wording, which reserved to claimant a concurrent right of access. More importantly, claimant failed to show that the temporary easement interfered with the parcel\u2019s marketability or development in more than a conjectural sense. Although claimant\u2019s appraiser opined that claimant likely could have obtained the zoning change needed to allow for commercial development, there is no evidence that he actually took any steps to do so. In addition, claimant never applied for a highway work permit to construct an entrance connecting the parcel to the Montauk Highway, which would likewise have been some evidence that he intended to market or develop the property; nor did he apply for the yard-width variance necessary for commercial development. Indeed, claimant\u2019s appraiser\u2019s testimony casts doubt on whether relief might be secured from both the zoning and yard-width requirements applicable to the lot, which\u2014unlike the examples in her report\u2014 had frontage on only one rather than two highways. In short, the record is devoid of any concrete evidence that claimant actually attempted to sell or develop\u2014or even contemplated selling <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>or developing\u2014the parcel, which was apparently only used occasionally as an auxiliary parking area for his dental office, and was entered from the adjacent parcel on the corner of Pease Lane and the Montauk Highway where his dental office was located. While prospective uncertainty might have a real effect on the sale value or development potential of vacant land, there is no evidence in this record from which a factfinder might conclude that claimant was, in fact, planning to sell or develop his property.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-5\">Accordingly, the order of the Appellate Division should be modified, with costs to the State, by remitting to the Court of Claims for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion and, as so modified, affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-6\">Chief Judge Kaye and Judges Ciparick, Graffeo, Smith, Pigott and Jones concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-7\">Order modified, etc.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
