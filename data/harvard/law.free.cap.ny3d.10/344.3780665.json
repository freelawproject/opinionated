We begin with the facts, which are substantially undisputed.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-8\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-9\">On May 24 or 25, 2004, Oleg Rivkin, a New Jersey resident who was in the market for a summer home on Ulster Heights Lake in Ulster County, contacted Century 21 Teran Realty LLC, a real estate brokerage firm located in Woodstock, New York. Teran is co-owned by Andrew Peck and Chloe Dresser, who are both licensed real estate brokers <em>(see </em>Real Property Law \u00a7 440 [1]). Teran also possesses a broker\u2019s license, which allows it to receive commissions in connection with the purchase and sale of real estate <em>(see id.; </em>Real Property Law \u00a7 440-a). At the time, 16 salespersons and four associate brokers worked under Teran\u2019s aegis <em>(see </em>Real Property Law \u00a7 440 [2], [3]; \u00a7 440-a).</p>\n<p id=\"b384-10\">Rivkin spoke with Joshua Luborsky, one of Teran\u2019s associate brokers, who told him about lakeside property at 103 Camp Road in Ellenville, which was listed for sale by another Century 21 franchise for $100,000. Details and pictures of the property posted by the local multiple listing service were forwarded to Rivkin by e-mail. The listing indicated that \u201call reasonable offers\u201d for this modest cottage on one acre, which \u201c[sat] right on the lake,\u201d should be presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>On May 25, 2004, Rivkin directed Luborsky to convey a verbal offer to the listing broker (the seller\u2019s agent) to purchase the Camp Road property for $75,000, and Luborsky promptly did so. According to Rivkin, until he actually saw the property, he \u201ccouldn\u2019t commit to . . . a contract[,] but at the same time [he] was very concerned that somebody was going to beat [him] out of [the property].\u201d He authorized the verbal offer \u201cto keep [his] spot\u201d so that he would not find himself \u201cout of the loop.\u201d Luborsky and Rivkin also arranged to meet at the site on May 28, 2004, the Friday before the impending Memorial Day holiday weekend, so that Rivkin might look at the property, with the expectation that he would make a written offer if it proved to be as suitable as he believed it to be.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-5\">Upon actually viewing the Camp Road property, Rivkin formed the opinion that \u201c[t]he building . . . was fairly worthless\u201d and \u201cdilapidated [and] needed to be knocked down\u201d; and that the \u201cvalue was entirely in the land [which was] fantastic.\u201d As he later put it, this property \u201cseemed to fit [his] requirements in every respect.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b385-6\">Rivkin knew that the Camp Road property \u201chad only been on the market ... a couple of weeks,\u201d but he quizzed Luborsky about \u201cwhether there had been other offers on the property.\u201d According to Rivkin, Luborsky replied that there had been other offers and, although he was \u201cnot aware of the amounts [,] . . . they were low enough not to have resulted in any counteroffers by the sellers.\u201d Rivkin asked Luborsky if he considered $75,000 to be \u201ca fair offer,\u201d and Luborsky indicated that it was, and that a counteroffer was likely. Rivkin agreed with Luborsky\u2019s assessment because \u201c[i]n [his] experience there [was] always an offer and counteroffer process.\u201d Further, he claims to have told Luborsky that he \u201cwas willing to go up to the asking price without any doubt,\u201d because \u201c[a]s far as [he] was concerned[,] the land was worth it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b385-7\">Rivkin then signed a written binder, offering to purchase the Camp Road property for $75,000, which Luborsky forwarded to the listing broker that same day, May 28, 2004. Rivkin also wrote a check to Teran for $1,500 as a deposit, and signed an acknowledgment that he had received, read and understood a form document entitled \u201cDisclosure Regarding Real Estate Agency Relationships\u201d provided to him by Luborsky. This document, mandated by and conforming to the requirements of article 12-A of the Real Property Law, states that the \u201cbuyer\u2019s agent acts solely on behalf of the buyer\u201d and has \u201cwithout <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>limitation, the following fiduciary duties to the buyer: reasonable care, undivided loyalty, confidentiality, full disclosure, obedience and a duty to account\u201d <em>(see also </em>former Real Property Law \u00a7 443 [4]).</p>\n<p id=\"b386-5\">As it turns out, on May 20, 2004, a few days before Rivkin first talked to Luborsky, Susanne and Robert Martin, who were looking to buy vacation or retirement property in Ulster County, had contacted Dresser, the co-owner of Teran. She told them about the Camp Road property, and they scheduled an appointment to meet at the site for an inspection. When Dresser called the listing broker on May 28, 2004 to arrange for this viewing, the listing broker let her know that there was an offer pending (presumably, Rivkin\u2019s), and that there might be several other showings over the holiday weekend. Upon seeing the Camp Road property, the Martins decided to offer $100,000, the listing price. On Sunday, May 30, 2004, they signed a written binder for that amount. Dresser promptly called the listing broker to advise her of this offer, and forwarded the written binder.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-6\">Luborsky contacted the listing broker on Saturday, May 29, 2004 to make sure that she had received Rivkin\u2019s written binder faxed the previous day. The listing broker confirmed that she had, but \u201cwould likely have trouble reaching\u201d the sellers because they were traveling over the holiday weekend. As a result, she told Luborsky not to expect a response to Rivkin\u2019s offer any sooner than the following Tuesday, June 1, 2004, and that the property \u201cmight be shown to others over the weekend.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b386-7\">Rivkin says that he called Luborsky on Sunday, May 30 and Monday, May 31 (Memorial Day), 2004 to inquire about the status of his offer. Luborsky claims to have told him everything that he had learned in his Saturday conversation with the listing broker, and Rivkin acknowledges at least that \u201cat some point . . . [Luborsky] told [him] that the property had been shown over the weekend.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b386-8\">According to Rivkin, on June 1, 2004 Luborsky told him that he had learned from the listing broker that offers had been received for the Camp Road property over the weekend, but that he did not know the particulars. Rivkin maintains that he reminded Luborsky that he wanted the opportunity to raise his $75,000 offer, and was prepared to do so; and that Luborsky assured him that he would try to find out from the listing broker whether the sellers were prepared to make a counteroffer, or wanted to receive \u201chighest and best\u201d final offers from all prospective purchasers.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>At 4:57 p.m. on June 1, 2004, Rivkin sent Luborsky the following e-mail:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-5\">\u201cWhat have you heard from the sellers\u2019 agent? Anything? I don\u2019t quite understand why it is taking so long to get a response from them. If they have changed their mind or don\u2019t want to entertain the offer, I would like to know now, so that I could make an offer on another property.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b387-6\">Sometime late in the afternoon or early evening, Luborsky picked up a voice mail message from the listing broker, who informed him that the sellers had accepted another offer, and so his client was \u201cout of the running.\u201d When Luborsky reported this to Rivkin, they commiserated about the loss and wondered why the sellers had not solicited a \u201chighest and best\u201d offer. According to Rivkin, Luborsky expressed the notion that the listing broker had \u201cacted inappropriately\u201d by steering the sale to one of its own clients.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-7\">At about 11:00 p.m. on June 1, 2004, Rivkin telephoned Carol Botnick, one of the sellers, to make sure that the listing broker had conveyed his $75,000 offer. Botnick, who co-owned the Camp Road property with her brother-in-law, Seymour Kraver, confirmed that she had received Rivkin\u2019s offer. When he asked her why there was no counteroffer, she replied that she \u201chad a better offer\u201d and that Rivkin\u2019s offer \u201cwas too low,\u201d but she would not tell him what the better offer was. When he asked \u201cwhat [it] would . . . take\u201d for him to acquire the property, she told him to deal with the listing broker, and not to call her again. Despite this rebuff, Rivkin next telephoned Kraver at about 11:15 p.m., telling him that he \u201creally like[d] the property, . . . how much the property meant to [him], how much the lake meant to [him].\u201d Kraver shrugged Rivkin off, telling him that the decision was \u201cbasically\u201d Botnick\u2019s to make.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-8\">Rivkin claims to have talked to the listing broker at some point on June 2, 2004, and to have learned from her that the sellers had received a full-price offer, which they had accepted orally. According to Rivkin, she made the following statement: \u201cI don\u2019t know if I should be telling you this, but . . . the full-price offer came from your own broker\u2019s office.\u201d Rivkin also says that he confronted Luborsky with this information on June 2, 2004, before instructing him to present an offer of $101,000 to the sellers, contingent only upon a water well inspection. He sent Luborsky an e-mail confirming this offer at 2:13 p.m. That same day, the listing broker informed Dresser that the sellers <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>had verbally accepted the Martins\u2019 $100,000 offer, and let Luborsky know that the sellers had rejected Rivkin\u2019s $101,000 offer.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-5\">After Luborsky informed Rivkin that his $101,000 offer had been turned down and\u2014\u201cfor the first time\u201d\u2014that the offer with which he was competing was contingency-free, Rivkin responded by e-mail at 7:32 p.m., instructing Luborsky to make an offer of $105,000, with no contingencies. Immediately thereafter, Rivkin telephoned Kraver to make the $105,000 offer personally. Kraver told Rivkin that he would consider it, but again left him with the impression that the decision was his sister-in-law\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-6\">On June 3, 2004, Rivkin contacted the listing broker directly to confirm the $105,000 offer, which the sellers ultimately turned down. He professes to have learned from the listing broker that Dresser was the buyer\u2019s agent for the successful purchaser, although the listing broker would not reveal the purchaser\u2019s identity. In an e-mail sent to Luborsky at 9:39 p.m., Rivkin terminated his relationship with Teran, and asked for his deposit to be returned. He told Luborsky that he had just spoken to Kraver, \u201cwho did not give [him] any explanation\u201d for rejecting the $105,000 offer, and that he was \u201cfrankly quite puzzled and not a little disappointed by all of this.\u201d He expressed his suspicion, however, that Peck (who co-owned Teran with Dresser) was the buyer.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-7\">On June 3, 2004, Rivkin\u2019s attorneys wrote to Peck, describing what they characterized as the \u201crather disturbing sequence of events [that] has transpired . . . , demonstrating a blatant breach by [Teran] of its fiduciary duty to . . . Rivkin, as well as actions evidencing [Teran\u2019s] egregious conflict of interest and self-dealing.\u201d Rivkin\u2019s attorneys threatened litigation. On June 6, 2004, Rivkin wrote to the listing broker to ask for certain documents. He complained that his \u201coffer was trumped by a full-price, no contingency offer from one of Teran\u2019s principals, in violation of their fiduciary duty to me.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b388-8\">Teran had no system in place for tracking whether its buyer\u2019s agents were representing multiple buyers bidding on the same property. According to Dresser, until Peck received the June 3rd letter from Rivkin\u2019s attorneys, she had no idea that Luborsky had made a competing offer for the Camp Road property. Peck was similarly unaware that Luborsky and Dresser were representing different buyers bidding on the Camp Road prop<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>erty, although he stressed that \u201c[i]t is common practice in New York for buyer\u2019 s-agents associated with a particular agency to assist a buyer-client in purchasing a property, while another buyer\u2019s-agent associated with the same agency is doing the same thing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b389-5\">Later in June 2004, Rivkin brought this suit against Teran, Peck, Dresser and Luborsky (collectively, defendants) in the United States District Court for the Northern District of New York, seeking damages stemming from the loss of the Camp Road property, and, as relevant to the certified question, asserting a claim for breach of fiduciary duty. After discovery, Rivkin moved for partial summary judgment on the issue of liability, and defendants moved for summary judgment dismissing the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-6\">On November 17, 2005, the District Court Judge granted defendants\u2019 motion and dismissed the case in an oral decision. By this time, Rivkin knew that the Martins<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> \u2014not Peck\u2014had purchased the Camp Road property. As the Judge analyzed Rivkin\u2019s revised theory of the case, \u201cthe gist of the legal issue\u201d was whether or not there was \u201ca per se rule that under circumstances like this, two employees of the same agency cannot, absent full disclosure, represent competing buyers for a piece of property.\u201d Observing that \u201cthere [was] not a single case in New York on these facts that has held that kind of conduct in the real estate industry violates the law,\u201d he \u201cdeclinefd] to so hold.\u201d He also considered it to be</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b389-7\">\u201cprobably unnecessary ... to even reach that issue, because on the facts, as everybody concedes them, there simply is no basis whatsoever to associate the harm in the representation from Luborsky to the harm to [Rivkin] from losing the property. They were all avenues available had the sellers of the property wanted to . . . sell him the property at the price he was willing to pay.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b389-9\">Rivkin appealed to the Second Circuit. Concluding that the case \u201cturn[ed] on an unsettled question of state law for which there [was] no direct precedent,\u201d the court stated that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b389-10\">\u201c[t]he issues . . . concern the nature and extent of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>a buyer\u2019s agent\u2019s obligation to avoid or mitigate conflicts of interest among its principals. It is clear that buyer\u2019s agents owe various fiduciary duties to their clients under New York\u2019s property law. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b390-5\">\u201cAlthough in <em>[Dubbs v Stribling &amp; Assoc., </em>96 NY2d 337 (2001)] the New York Court of Appeals made the general statement that it is well settled that a real estate broker is a fiduciary with a duty of loyalty and an obligation to act in the best interests of the principal, <em>Dubbs </em>addressed the duties of seller\u2019s agents rather than buyer\u2019s agents.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b390-6\">\u201cIndeed, it appears that no New York case deals with a buyer\u2019s\u2014rather than a seller\u2019s\u2014agent\u2019s duties. The real estate marketplace may, for various reasons, dictate different duties for these two kinds of agents. In addition, even if we were to presume that sellers\u2019 and buyers\u2019 agents owe identical fiduciary duties, the facts of the New York cases that deal with sellers\u2019 agents\u2019 duties are materially different from those here: <em>Dubbs, </em>for example, involved allegations of an improper personal stake in the transaction, and <em>Sonnenschein [v Douglas Elliman-Gibbons &amp; Ives </em>(96 NY2d 369 [2001])] addressed whether a seller\u2019s broker may offer the properties of all of its principals to a potential customer. Thus, these cases neither answer the questions in this case nor can be used with confidence to reasonably predict the answer\u201d <em>(Rivkin v Century 21 Teran Realty LLC, </em>494 F3d 99, 106-107 [2d Cir 2007] [internal quotation marks and citations omitted]).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b390-7\">Further, \u201ccausation analysis will turn on the type of disclosure that New York law requires a buyer\u2019s agent to make\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 107). Consequently, the Second Circuit certified the following question to us: \u201cDid any or all of [defendants] breach a fiduciary duty to Rivkin by failing to disclose, in any form, [defendants\u2019] representation of a competing buyer for the property Rivkin sought to buy?\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at 108.)</p>\n<p id=\"b390-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-9\">\u201cThe trend of [real estate agents] representing buyers began primarily on the west coast in the mid-1980\u2019s when states enacted the first agency disclosure laws making the practice viable\u201d (Brown, Grohman and Valcarcel, <em>Real Estate Brokerage: </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number><em>Recent Changes in Relationships and a Proposed Cure, </em>29 Creighton L Rev 25, 42 [1995]). New York\u2019s agency disclosure statute, Real Property Law \u00a7 443, was originally enacted in 1991 <em>(see </em>L 1991, ch 726). This legislation sought \u201cto address an issue of paramount concern to the Secretary of State\u201d; specifically, although brokers and salespersons were required to make clear whether they represented the seller\u2014as was traditionally the case\u2014or the buyer in a residential sales transaction, \u201c[t]he lack of a requirement that the information be provided in writing and in a uniform manner . . . resulted in uneven disclosure which too often . . . failed to eliminate confusion on the part of buyers or sellers as to the loyalties and duties of agents with whom they [were] dealing\u201d (Assembly Mem in Support, Bill Jacket, L 1991, ch 726, at 16). Section 443 mandates disclosure for transactions involving one-to-four-family residential dwellings for sale or lease, but not condominium or cooperative apartments in a building with more than four units (Budget Report on Bills, <em>id. </em>at 11; Real Property Law \u00a7 443 [1] [\u00cd]).</p>\n<p id=\"b391-5\">The statute defines a \u201cbuyer\u2019s agent\u201d as \u201can agent who contracts to locate residential real property for a buyer or who finds a buyer for a property and presents an offer to purchase to the seller or seller\u2019s agent and negotiates on behalf of the buyer\u201d (Real Property Law \u00a7 443 [1] [c]). A buyer\u2019s agent must present the buyer with a disclosure form, the terms of which are statutorily prescribed, \u201cprior to entering into an agreement to act as the buyer\u2019s agent\u201d and generally must \u201cobtain a signed acknowledgment from the buyer\u201d (Real Property Law \u00a7 443 [3] [c]). As previously noted, the form declares that the buyer\u2019s agent \u201cacts solely on behalf of the buyer\u201d and has \u201cwithout limitation, the following fiduciary duties to the buyer: reasonable care, undivided loyalty, confidentiality, full disclosure, obedience and a duty to account\u201d <em>(see also </em>former Real Property Law \u00a7 443 [4]).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b391-6\">Rivkin places great weight on the words \u201csolely\u201d and \u201cundivided\u201d and the phrase \u201cwithout limitation,\u201d arguing, in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>effect, that they bespeak the Legislature\u2019s determination, or at least its recognition, that a brokerage firm may not represent multiple bidders for the same property without disclosure and consent. We disagree. When the Legislature adopted section 443, the perceived mantle of \u201cconfusion\u201d obscured consumers\u2019 awareness as to whether a real estate broker or salesperson was acting in the interest of the seller or the buyer or both (i.e., dual agency) in a particular transaction, not whether a brokerage firm might represent multiple buyers (or sellers) with competing interests. Indeed, the disclosure form specifically states that the fiduciary duty is owed by an individual licensee and not the firm; that is, section 443 talks in terms of an \u201cagent,\u201d defined as <em>\u201ca person </em>who is licensed as a real estate broker or real estate sales associate . . . and is acting in a fiduciary capacity\u201d <em>(see </em>Real Property Law \u00a7 443 [1] [a] [emphasis added]). The Legislature did not, for example, say \u201cany person, firm, limited liability company or corporation,\u201d as it did when defining the term \u201creal estate broker\u201d in subdivision (1) of section 440.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-5\">Subdivision (6) of section 443, however, preserves \u201cthe common law of agency with respect to residential real estate transactions.\u201d And in <em>Sonnenschein </em>and Dubbs\u2014the two cases prominently mentioned by the Second Circuit\u2014we explored a real estate broker\u2019s fiduciary duty under the common law with respect to sellers. Looking to other jurisdictions, we concluded in <em>Sonnenschein </em>that \u201c[o]nce oral negotiations have commenced between a seller and a potential purchaser concerning a real estate transaction, . . . the brokerage firm that produced the potential purchaser [does not] owe the seller a duty to refrain from showing the potential purchaser additional properties\u201d (96 NY2d at 372). We considered \u201cthis approach to be consistent with the nature and fundamental requirements of the real estate marketplace in New York,\u201d reasoning that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-6\">\u201ca broker cannot be expected to decline a prospective purchaser\u2019s request to see another property listed for sale with that broker. Any other rule would unreasonably restrain a broker from simultaneously representing two or more principals with similar properties for fear of violating a fiduciary obligation in the event a buyer chose the property of one principal over that of another. Similarly, such a limitation would frustrate the interests of sellers, who benefit from the opportunity to market their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>properties to as many potential purchasers as possible, as well as the interests of potential buyers, who often request exposure to a number of properties in order to select the one most suitable to their needs and budget\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 376).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b393-5\">In <em>Dubbs, </em>the owners/sellers placed their apartment for sale on an \u201copen listing,\u201d which meant that the sellers would pay a commission to the broker who located the buyer. The sellers confided to their real estate agent that, rather than selling the apartment, they would have preferred to keep it, purchase the adjacent apartment and combine the two into a single unit, but that their neighbor refused to sell. The real estate agent showed the apartment to several prospective buyers. Thereafter, she made an offer on the apartment herself, and the parties entered into a written contract for its sale. Prior to closing, the real estate agent contracted to buy the adjacent apartment without advising the sellers that it had been placed on the market.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-6\">The sellers commenced an action against their real estate agent claiming that she had breached her fiduciary duty to them by failing to let them know that their neighbor\u2019s apartment was for sale. We observed that \u201c[w]here a broker\u2019s interests or loyalties are divided due to a personal stake in the transaction or representation of multiple parties, the broker must disclose to the principal the nature and extent of the broker\u2019s interest in the transaction or the material facts illuminating the broker\u2019s divided loyalties\u201d <em>(Dubbs, </em>96 NY2d at 340). We determined, however, that the broker/principal relationship and accompanying fiduciary duty was severed before the agent learned that the neighbor\u2019s apartment was on the market.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-7\">Although <em>Dubbs </em>addressed the duty of a seller\u2019s agent, rather than a buyer\u2019s agent, our observation in <em>Dubbs </em>that \u201c[w]here a broker\u2019s interests or loyalties are divided due to . . . [the] representation of multiple parties, the broker must disclose to the principal . . . the material facts illuminating the broker\u2019s divided loyalties\u201d bears on agency relationships generally <em>(Dubbs, </em>96 NY2d at 340; <em>see </em>Restatement [Second] of Agency \u00a7 389 [\u201cUnless otherwise agreed, an agent is subject to a duty not to deal with his principal as an adverse party in a transaction connected with his agency without the principal\u2019s knowledge\u201d]). Concomitantly, a buyer\u2019s agent must inform the buyer of the duty of \u201cundivided loyalty . . . [and] full disclosure\u201d (Real Property Law \u00a7 443 [3] [c]; [4] [a]). Simultaneously representing multiple buyers with respect to the same property <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>is inconsistent with these duties, absent disclosure and consent. Further, section 443 (4) (a) of the Real Property Law creates an expectation that a buyer\u2019s agent will, in fact, not at one and the same time take the side of different buyers bidding for the same property.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-5\">That being said, in <em>Sonnenschein </em>we adopted a rule \u201cconsistent with the nature and fundamental requirements of the real estate marketplace in New York\u201d (96 NY2d at 376). Here, practical considerations cause us to draw a distinction between the fiduciary duty owed by the buyer\u2019s <em>individual </em>agent and that owed by the agent\u2019s <em>firm. </em>An individual buyer\u2019s agent acting on behalf of multiple clients bidding on the same property cannot negotiate an optimal purchase price for all of them. The buyers\u2019 interests conflict; the agent\u2019s representation is inevitably compromised. But two buyer\u2019s agents simply affiliated with the same real estate brokerage firm and acting on behalf of different buyers bidding on the same property generally do not present comparable risks. There is no incentive for these agents to represent their clients less than zealously, consistent with their fiduciary duties under Real Property Law \u00a7 443 (4) (a) and common law: they only earn commissions for sales to their own clients. As a result, in this situation the agents have every reason to negotiate in their clients\u2019 best interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-6\">As the New York State Association of REALTORS, Inc. (NYSAR) points out in its amicus brief, in today\u2019s real estate marketplace buyers are routinely represented by buyer\u2019s agents, and real estate licensees are commonly affiliated with megabrokerage firms featuring multiple licensees and offices. Indeed, NYSAR avows that numerous brokerage firms in New York have more than 100 or 200\u2014and, in three cases, more than 1,000\u2014affiliated licensees. Would-be buyers are very well aware that they are competing with other potential buyers, including those represented by other agents affiliated with the firm that they have retained. As we noted in <em>Sonnenschein </em>when discussing seller\u2019s agents, \u201c[u]nless a broker and principal <em>specifically agree otherwise, </em>a broker cannot be expected to decline a prospective purchaser\u2019s request to see another property listed for sale with that broker\u201d (96 NY2d at 376 [emphasis added]). As a corollary, unless a real estate brokerage firm and principal specifically agree otherwise, the firm is not obligated to insure that its affiliated licensees forgo making offers on behalf of other buyers for property on which the principal has already bid. Disclosure and consent are not prerequisites to a competing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>offer in this circumstance. An individual agent, however, may not represent multiple buyers bidding on the same property without making disclosure and obtaining consent.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-5\">Accordingly, the certified question should be answered in the negative.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-6\">Chief Judge Kaye and Judges Ciparick, Graffeo, Smith, Pigott and Jones concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-7\">Following certification of a question by the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit and acceptance of the question by this Court pursuant to section 500.27 of the Rules of Practice of the Court of Appeals (22 NYCRR 500.27), and after hearing argument by counsel for the parties and consideration of the briefs and the record submitted, certified question answered in the negative.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b389-11\">. The Martins signed a contract for the purchase of the Camp Road property on June 11, 2004, which was evidently executed by the sellers, Botnick and Kraver, on June 25, 2004; the closing occurred on August 18, 2004.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b391-7\">. Section 443 has been amended twice since 2004, when the events described in this appeal took place (see L 2006, ch 569; L 2007, ch 549). The 2006 amendments resulted in the splitting of subdivision (4) of section 443 into paragraphs (a) (dealing with buyer-seller transactions) and (b) (dealing with landlord-tenant transactions), and made some minor changes in wording with respect to buyer\u2019s agents, apparently for the sake of clarity. Those changes included deletion of the sentence stating that \u201c[a] buyer\u2019s agent acts solely on behalf of the buyer.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
