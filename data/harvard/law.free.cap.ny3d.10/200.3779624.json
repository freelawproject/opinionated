Panasia had a commercial property insurance policy with Hudson Insurance Company, which included \u201cBuilders\u2019 Risk Coverage,\u201d covering damage to its property while undergoing renovation. During the policy period, the roof of its building was opened in order to perform construction work. Inclement weather caused rain to enter the building through the roof opening, resulting in extensive damage to the property.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b240-8\">Shortly after the occurrence, Panasia claimed it promptly notified Hudson of the loss. According to Panasia, however, Hudson failed to investigate or adjust the claim until several weeks later. Hudson then denied the claim three months after that, stating that Panasia\u2019s loss was the result of repeated water infiltration over time and wear and tear rather than from a risk covered under the builders risk policy provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-9\">Panasia commenced this action against Hudson, alleging that it breached the insurance contract by failing to properly investigate the loss and denying the loss as not covered under the policy. Panasia sought both direct and consequential damages that it claimed stemmed from Hudson\u2019s breach.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>Hudson moved for partial summary judgment \u201cdismissing all of [Panasia\u2019s] bad faith allegations and all prayers for consequential, extra-contractual, or incidental damages or attorneys <em>[sic] </em>fees.\u201d Hudson argued, among other things, that a contractual exclusion for \u201c[a]ny other consequential loss\u201d precluded Panasia\u2019s request for consequential damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-4\">As pertinent here, Supreme Court denied that part of Hudson\u2019s motion to dismiss Panasia\u2019s claims for consequential damages. The Appellate Division affirmed, stating that \u201c[a]n insured may recover foreseeable damages, beyond the limits of its policy, for breach of a duty to investigate, bargain for and settle claims in good faith\u201d (39 AD3d 343 [2007], citing <em>Acquista v New York Life Ins. Co., </em>285 AD2d 73 [1st Dept 2001]). In addition, the court concluded that Hudson failed to show that the contractual exclusion for \u201c \u2018consequential loss\u2019 \u201d applied to Panasia\u2019s claim, rejecting Hudson\u2019s argument that \u201cconsequential loss\u201d and \u201cconsequential damages\u201d were synonymous <em>(id.).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b241-5\">The Appellate Division granted Hudson leave to appeal to this Court, certifying the question: \u201cWas the order of the Supreme Court, as affirmed by this Court, properly made?\u201d We conclude that it was.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-6\">The courts below properly rejected Hudson\u2019s contention that it was entitled to judgment as a matter of law because consequential damages are not recoverable in a claim for breach of an insurance contract. As we explained in <em>Bi-Economy Mkt., Inc. v Harleysville Ins. Co. of N.Y. </em>(10 NY3d 187 [2008] [decided today]), consequential damages resulting from a breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing may be asserted in an insurance contract context, so long as the damages were \u201c \u2018within the contemplation of the parties as the probable result of a breach at the time of or prior to contracting\u2019 \u201d (at 192, quoting <em>Kenford Co. v County of Erie, </em>73 NY2d 312, 319 [1989]). Here, the courts below failed to consider whether the specific damages sought by Panasia were foreseeable damages as the result of Hudson\u2019s breach. Because the record before us is not fully developed on that issue, such claim must be considered by Supreme Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-7\">Lastly, as the Appellate Division correctly concluded, the contractual exclusion for consequential loss does not bar the recovery of consequential damages <em>(see Bi-Economy </em>at 196).</p>\n<p id=\"b242-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>Accordingly, the order of the Appellate Division should be affirmed, with costs, and certified question answered in the affirmative.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b240-10\"> As this is an appeal from a summary judgment motion, we view the facts in the light most favorable to Panasia, the nonmoving party.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b242-5\">Smith, J.
