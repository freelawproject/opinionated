INTRODUCTION</p>\n<p id=\"b474-11\">This case presents a difficult but interesting question. When a defendant makes a false statement in connection with the purchase or sale of securities, that st\u00e1tement is only actionable if the defendant acted with a culpable state of mind. The easiest case is when a plaintiff alleges that a defendant intentionally made a demonstrably false statement. When this allegation is made, a court need not consider whether a defendant acted recklessly or was merely negligent.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-16\">Moving up the scale, a plaintiff can also maintain a securities fraud action premised on a defendant\u2019s recklessness. Courts have defined recklessness as conduct that is \u201chighly unreasonable, representing an extreme departure from the standards of ordinary care to the extent that the danger was either known to the defendant or so obvious that the defendant must have been aware of it.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In such cases, intent is sufficiently pled when a plaintiff alleges that a defendant had access to information contradicting the false statement, failed to check information it had a duty to monitor, or ignored obvious signs of fraud.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Here, too, a court is not required to analyze whether the conduct at issue was negligent as opposed to reckless, because such allegations preclude a finding of negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-17\">The issue becomes more difficult when considering a misleading statement, as opposed to a false statement. A \u201cmisleading\u201d statement is one that is accurate and truthful\u2014but only as far as it goes. Even a literally true statement becomes misleading when it omits material information that could cause a reasonable investor to be misled about the nature of the investment in question.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Of course, such a statement is only actionable when the defendant acted with the requisite intent. It is entirely <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>possible for a defendant to make an honest but negligent mistake in judging how much detail needs to be included in public statements in order to avoid misleading the market. The purpose of section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 is to punish knowing fraud or reckless behavior, not mistakes that arise from negligent or even grossly negligent behavior.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b475-5\">Thus, in such cases it is especially important to rigorously apply the standard for pleading intent, because defendants should not be required to incur litigation expenses every time an aggrieved investor claims that an accurate statement was rendered misleading based on the absence of additional information.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Similarly, if courts are too quick to infer culpability whenever investors are confused by a defendant\u2019s statement, the focus of the intent inquiry could shift from that defendant\u2019s state of mind to public perceptions.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-6\">The question addressed in this Opinion, then, is how a court should determine whether the alleged failure to disclose additional information is intentional, reckless, or negligent, when the alleged misleading statement is literally true. The long answer is found by reading the entire Opinion. The short answer is that a court must consider the viability of the alleged scheme to defraud, the entire alleged misstatement (not just certain phrases), the context in which the statement was made, the public\u2019s access to additional information, the defendant\u2019s response to any market confusion resulting from the alleged misstatement, and any other indicia that the defendant acted with fraudulent intent. If all of these factors are given full consideration, the mist created by creative counsel dissipates and the intent, or lack of it, is revealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-13\">II. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b475-14\">On September 30, 2005, I dismissed this putative class action brought on behalf of certain purchasers of common stock in GeoPharma, Inc. (\u201cGeoPharma\u201d), a publicly-traded pharmaceutical company, without prejudice.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Plaintiffs have now filed an Amended Complaint, again alleging violations of sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder by the Securities and Exchange Commission (\u201cSEC\u201d).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> All defendants again move to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>This suit arises from a December 1, 2004 GeoPharma press release (the \u201cDecember 1 Release\u201d), announcing Food and Drug Administration (\u201cFDA\u201d) approval of Mucotrol, a new product for the treatment of mucositis.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In pre-class period statements during the summer of 2004, GeoPharma had disclosed to investors that it was developing a \u201cdrug\u201d to fight mucositis. However, when GeoPharma applied for FDA approval of this product, it sought approval for a less lucrative \u201cmedical device.\u201d GeoPharma obtained approval for its medical device on November 24, 2004, and disclosed this approval in the December 1 Release. But in the release, GeoPharma referred to Mucotrol as neither a drug nor a medical device, instead employing the term \u201cprescription product.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b476-4\">Although Mucotrol is in fact a product available by prescription, investors apparently believed that GeoPharma obtained approval of a new <em>drug, </em>and immediately drove GeoPharma\u2019s stock to its highest price ever. But within hours of the December 1 Release, the FDA made clear that GeoPharma had merely obtained approval for a medical device. By the evening of December 2, GeoPharma\u2019s stock dropped back to its pre-Release price, and plaintiffs filed their first suit later that day.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-5\">III. THE AMENDED COMPLAINT</p>\n<p id=\"b476-6\">The Amended Complaint sets forth similar allegations as the previously-dismissed Complaint. The allegations were detailed in the September 30 Opinion,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> but I will briefly outline the pertinent facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-13\">The putative class period is December 1, 2004 through December 2, 2004.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> In addition to the Company, plaintiffs name three individual defendants: President Kotha S. Sckharam, CEO Mihir K. Taneja, and Chairman of the Board of Directors Jugal Taneja.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> All three defendants held these positions during the putative class period.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b476-14\">A. Pre-Class Period Statements Regarding Mucotrol</p>\n<p id=\"b476-15\">On June 29, 2004, GeoPharma disclosed that it was conducting \u201cformulation work\u201d and \u201cpreliminary double blind placebo controlled clinical studies\u201d on a patent-pending drug to treat mucositis.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> GeoPharma again referred to a mucositis drug in a July 13, 2004 press release, stating that it had completed a clinical study to evaluate such a drug.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> This press release also stated that the drug\u2019s \u201cmarket potential is estimated to be at $300 million to $500 million.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b476-16\">However, on September 1, 2004, GeoPharma filed an application with the FDA seeking approval to market a <em>medical device </em>by the name of Mucotrol Concentrated Oral gel wafer (\u201cMucotrol\u201d).<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The FDA granted approval for Mucotrol to be marketed as a medical device in a letter dated November 24, 2004 (\u201cFDA Letter\u201d).<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Defendants did not disclose either <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>the September application or the FDA\u2019s approval of a medical device until December 2, 2004.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b477-5\">B. The December 1 Release</p>\n<p id=\"b477-6\">On December 1, 2004, prior to the opening of the markets, GeoPharma issued a press release entitled \u201cGeoPharma, Inc. Receives FDA Approval for Mucotrol\u2122; Manages Mucositis Caused by Radiation and Chemotherapy Required in Cancer Treatment.\u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> The December 1 Release stated in pertinent part that \u201cGeoPharma, Inc. today announced that Belcher Pharmaceuticals, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of GeoPharma, Inc., has received approval from the [FDA] for Mucotrol\u2122, a <em>prescription product </em>for the management of oral mucositis/stomatitis.\u201d<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> The Release further stated that, given the number of people who suffer from mucositis, \u201concology market potential for Mucotrol\u2122 sales are between $75 million and $300 million per annum and the estimated global market is between $250 million and $1 billion per annum.\u201d<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"Af4\">Immediately after the December 1 Release, GeoPharma\u2019s stock price reached an all-time high of $11.25 per share, an increase of 153%.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Volume was extraordinary\u201442 million shares changed hands on December 1, as opposed to an average daily volume of 22,000 shares.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b477-12\">C. Corrective Disclosures</p>\n<p id=\"b477-13\">Responding to media inquiries immediately after the December 1 Release, an FDA spokesperson erroneously stated that the agency had no record of <em>any </em>approval for Mucotrol.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> After this FDA statement, the price of GeoPharma stock tumbled. When trading was halted at 1:30 p.m. on December 1, the stock had fallen to $6.81 per share.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> The FDA then clarified that Mucotrol had received marketing approval as a medical device.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b477-14\">The next morning, GeoPharma issued another press release to address the confusion caused by the December 1 Release, stating that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b477-15\">The Company\u2019s application to the FDA requested approval for [Mucotrol] to be approved to be marketed for the mechanical action indicated for the management of pain by soothing oral lesions caused by chemotherapy or radiotherapy mucositis/stomatitis, oral irritations due to oral surgery, braces or dentures in addition to diffusing apthous ulcers. Although it is estimated that approximately 300,000 cancer patients in the U.S. suffer from mucositis, revenues from the Company\u2019s distribution of MucotrolO cannot be estimated at this time.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b478-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>After the markets closed on December 2, GeoPharma and two of the individual defendants held a conference call with investors to discuss the December 1 Release. On the call, defendants Mihir Taneja and Sekharam stated that they had not yet attempted to estimate Mucotrol\u2019s potential revenues.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> Asked why previous company releases referred to development of a drug to treat mucositis when Mucotrol was in fact a device, Sekharam stated that GeoPharma initially tried to develop a drug treatment but ended up with a device.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> After the conference call, GeoPharma\u2019s share price fell 12.48% in after-market activity on December 2, to $6.45 per share.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> The shares fell to $5.46 per share the next day.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b478-4\">D. Scienter Allegations</p>\n<p id=\"b478-5\">Plaintiffs allege that in 2004, GeoPharma embarked on a strategy to transition from a producer of dietary supplements into a drug manufacturer'\u2014a transition requiring capital infusions.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> To this end, GeoPharma entered into three separate financing arrangements in the Spring of 2004. The terms of each agreement vary, but these agreements generally provide that, if GeoPharma\u2019s common stock attained a certain average closing price for at least five consecutive days, \u201c[d]efendants could force a portion of its note holders and preferred shareholders to accept shares of [GeoPharma\u2019s] common stock in lieu of cash payments.\u201d<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> Plaintiffs allege that defendants, frustrated by GeoPharma\u2019s inability throughout 2004 to attain the required closing price, embarked on a scheme that would relieve GeoPharma of its obligation to \u201cmake expensive monthly cash payments to the Company\u2019s note holders and preferred stock owners.\u201d<footnotemark>34</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b478-13\">Plaintiffs also allege that defendants knew, or were reckless in not knowing, that the December 1 Release was materially false or misleading. Specifically, plaintiffs allege that defendants\u2019 scienter is evidenced by their failure to disclose their knowledge of (1) GeoPharma\u2019s September 2004 application for FDA approval of Mucotrol as a medical device; (2) the November 24 FDA approval of Mucotrol as a medical device; and (3) GeoPharma\u2019s use of revenue projections consistent with a new drug, rather than a medical device.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b478-14\">IV. LEGAL STANDARD</p>\n<p id=\"AWt\">A. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b478-15\">A motion to dismiss pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) should be granted only if \u201c \u2018it appears beyond doubt that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of [its] claim which would entitle [it] to relief.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> When deciding a motion to dismiss, courts must accept all factual allegations in the complaint as true, and draw all reasonable inferences in plaintiffs favor.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> Although the plaintiffs allegations are taken as true, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>the claim may still fail as a matter of law if it appears beyond doubt that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of its claim which would entitle it to relief, or if the claim is not legally feasible.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b479-4\">B. Scienter</p>\n<p id=\"b479-5\">A prima facie case of securities fraud under section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 requires that \u201cthe defendant, in connection with the purchase or sale of securities, made a materially false statement or omitted a material fact, with scienter, and that plaintiffs reliance on defendant\u2019s action caused injury to the plaintiff.\u201d<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> The requisite state of mind, or scienter, in an action under section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 is \u201c \u2018an intent to deceive, manipulate or defraud.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>40</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b479-6\">Under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act (\u201cPSLRA\u201d), the complaint must \u201cstate with particularity facts giving rise to a strong inference that the defendant acted with the required state of mind.\u201d<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> \u201cAlthough speculation and conclusory allegations will not suffice, neither do we require \u2018great specificity\u2019 provided the plaintiff alleges enough facts to support \u2018a strong inference of fraudulent intent.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> Facts giving rise to a strong inference of scienter can be alleged by one of two methods: the plaintiff may plead \u201cmotive and opportunity to commit fraud\u201d or \u201cstrong circumstantial evidence of conscious misbehavior or recklessness.\u201d<footnotemark>43</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b479-14\">1. Motive and Opportunity</p>\n<p id=\"b479-15\">\u201cMotive would entail concrete benefits that could be realized by one or more of the false statements and wrongful nondisclosures alleged,\u201d while \u201c[opportunity would entail the means and likely prospect of achieving concrete benefits by the means alleged.\u201d<footnotemark>44</footnotemark> \u201cMotives that are generally possessed by most corporate directors and officers do not suffice; instead, plaintiffs must assert a concrete and personal benefit to the individual defendants resulting from the fraud.\u201d<footnotemark>45</footnotemark> The desire \u201cto inflate stock prices while [defendants] sold their own shares\u201d may support a viable claim.<footnotemark>46</footnotemark> Some courts have also found that a company\u2019s desire to inflate its stock price in order to complete a stock-based acquisition can establish scienter.<footnotemark>47</footnotemark> As for opportunity, courts often assume that corporations and their officers have the opportunity to commit fraud,<footnotemark>48</footnotemark> but opportunity may not exist if the alleged scheme had no chance of succeeding.<footnotemark>49</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b480-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>2. Conscious Misbehavior or Recklessness</p>\n<p id=\"b480-3\">When plaintiffs have failed to plead motive and opportunity, \u201cit is still possible to plead scienter by identifying circumstances indicating conscious behavior [or recklessness] by defendant, though the strength of the circumstantial allegations must be correspondingly greater.\u201d<footnotemark>50</footnotemark> To allege recklessness, the facts must \u201capproximate an actual intent to aid in the fraud being perpetrated.\u201d<footnotemark>51</footnotemark> Plaintiff must allege facts showing that the defendants\u2019 conduct was \u201chighly unreasonable, representing an extreme departure from the standards of ordinary care to the extent that the danger was either known to the defendant or so obvious that the defendant must have been aware of it.\u201d<footnotemark>52</footnotemark> Recklessness is often shown when plaintiff \u201cspecifically alleges defendants\u2019 knowledge of facts or access to information contradicting their public statements.\u201d<footnotemark>53</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b480-11\">V. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"AZ6\">A. Scienter</p>\n<p id=\"b480-12\">1. Motive and Opportunity</p>\n<p id=\"b480-13\">In the September 30 Opinion, I held that plaintiffs\u2019 motive allegations failed \u201cfor a fundamental reason\u2014the alleged scheme could not possibly have succeeded. The FDA approval of Mucotrol was public information, and it would have been obvious <em>ex ante </em>to defendants that financial reporters and/or analysts would contact the FDA immediately after the December 1 Release (which is of course what occurred).\u201d<footnotemark>54</footnotemark> Thus, \u201c[t]here was never the slightest chance that GeoPharma stock could be inflated by the December 1 Release for anywhere close to the five days needed to carry out the alleged scheme.\u201d<footnotemark>55</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b480-14\">Plaintiffs assert that this holding amounted to improper hindsight analysis.<footnotemark>56</footnotemark> Plaintiffs are mistaken. The September 30 Opinion did not rely on the fact that the scheme happened to fail in this case, but rather on whether a rational defendant could have <em>expected </em>that the alleged scheme could succeed.<footnotemark>57</footnotemark> And given that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>the December 1 Release made a rapidly verifiable representation about FDA action already taken, plaintiffs\u2019 cases involving misrepresentations about the likelihood of <em>future </em>FDA action are inapposite.<footnotemark>58</footnotemark> When evaluating motive and opportunity allegations, the Second Circuit authorizes inquiry, even at the motion to dismiss stage, as to whether plaintiffs allege a scheme that has any chance of achieving its putative ends.<footnotemark>59</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b481-5\">That said, plaintiffs have clarified their allegations in a manner that merits reconsideration of this aspect of the September 80 Opinion. Plaintiffs note that the \u201ctarget price that triggered the conversion feature [of one of the securities purchase agreements] was the average closing price of five consecutive trading days.\u201d<footnotemark>60</footnotemark> \u201cTherefore, even when the full extent of the fraud was discovered after only two days, as <em>ivas the actual case here, </em>the scheme could have succeeded.\u201d<footnotemark>61</footnotemark> Given this clarification, it is conceivable, although extremely unlikely, that defendants might have expected to confuse the market for the required length of time, and thus inflate GeoPharma stock by the required amount.<footnotemark>62</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b481-10\">Even assuming <em>arguendo </em>that the alleged scheme could have succeeded, plaintiffs have not sufficiently addressed the independent grounds for rejecting their motive and opportunity allegations. The September 30 Opinion noted that \u201c[c]ourts in this Circuit have consistently held that allegations that a defendant was motivated to commit securities fraud by a desire to reduce its debt burden, or otherwise reduce borrowing costs, are insufficient to raise a scienter inference.\u201d<footnotemark>63</footnotemark> \u201cPlaintiffs\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>allegations that GeoPharma sought to reduce its cash outlays for debt service fall squarely into this category.\u201d<footnotemark>64</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b482-4\">Plaintiffs offer two arguments, but no new allegations, to dispute this holding. Plaintiffs first repeat their argument from the first motion to dismiss that the desire to inflate the stock to activate the conversion feature of GeoPharma\u2019s financing agreements is a valid motive because it represents a \u201cspecific corporate transaction.\u201d<footnotemark>65</footnotemark> This argument is no more convincing now, given that plaintiffs again rely only on cases where motive was alleged because the defendant company intended to carry out corporate acquisitions.<footnotemark>66</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b482-12\">Plaintiffs also assert that GeoPharma\u2019s motive, properly understood, was to achieve its strategic goal of \u201ctransforming the company into a generic drug manufacturing and distribution company,\u201d not merely to reduce its debt load and maintain a sound balance sheet.<footnotemark>67</footnotemark> In response, defendants correctly note that \u201ctransforming [GeoPharma] into a generic drug manufacturing company [is an invalid motive because it] would benefit all shareholders generally, not just defendants.\u201d <footnotemark>68</footnotemark> In fact, the only tangible benefit from the alleged scheme would be lower debt service. Plaintiffs\u2019 new characterization of the same allegations cannot change the result\u2014after all, any otherwise-invalid motive can usual<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>ly be framed as part of some \u201cstrategic goal.\u201d<footnotemark>69</footnotemark> Moreover, the Amended Complaint itself emphasizes that it was important for GeoPharma to activate the conversion features because of its limited cash reserves.<footnotemark>70</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b483-5\">Finally, the Amended Complaint, like the earlier Complaint, is devoid of motive allegations against the individual defendants.<footnotemark>71</footnotemark> Defendants note that the alleged scheme would have harmed the individual defendants, because converting debt into equity would dilute their stock holdings.<footnotemark>72</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b483-10\">2. Conscious Misbehavior or Recklessness</p>\n<p id=\"b483-11\">Plaintiffs contend that, considered in the context created by defendants\u2019 own statements as well as surrounding suspicious circumstances, the Amended Complaint adequately pleads defendants\u2019 intent to mislead or recklessness.<footnotemark>73</footnotemark> While GeoPharma\u2019s behavior as depicted in this Complaint may be less than ideal for a publicly-traded corporation, plaintiffs have failed to meet the pleading burden imposed by the PSLRA. For the following reasons, and even considering plaintiffs\u2019 allegations as a whole,<footnotemark>74</footnotemark> I cannot conclude that defendants exhibited the \u201cextreme departure from the standards of ordinary care\u201d characteristic of recklessness.<footnotemark>75</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b484-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>a. Failure to Disclose FDA Letter</p>\n<p id=\"b484-4\">Plaintiffs have described the prescription product statement as an affirmative misstatement, and argued the recklessness issue through that lens. However, the prescription product statement is best analyzed as an <em>omission. </em>While GeoPharma disclosed its FDA approval for Mucotrol, it omitted the more detailed and specific information regarding Mucotrol\u2019s approval as a <em>medical device. </em>The true gravamen of plaintiffs\u2019 allegations, then, is that the prescription product statement was \u201cmisleading, though not technically false, [because it amounted] to a half-truth by omitting some material fact.\u201d<footnotemark>76</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b484-5\">Plaintiffs ask this Court to infer scienter from the fact that the December 1 Release failed to disclose the precise nature of the FDA approval obtained by GeoPharma, as embodied in the November 24 FDA Letter.<footnotemark>77</footnotemark> Defendants do not and cannot dispute that GeoPharma was under a duty to disclose sufficient detail about Mucotrol to render the December 1 Release not misleading.<footnotemark>78</footnotemark> Thus, enough detail about Mucotrol had to be disclosed in the December 1 Release to achieve that goal. In granting the initial motion to dismiss, I held that \u201ca reasonable investor <em>could have been </em>misled by failing to absorb the fine distinction between the terms \u2018drug\u2019 and \u2018prescription product\u2019 \u201d\u2014a conclusion reached at the pleading stage, with all reasonable inferences drawn in plaintiffs\u2019 favor.<footnotemark>79</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b484-12\">But a failure to disclose particular information, by itself, can only constitute recklessness if there was an obvious duty to disclose that information.<footnotemark>80</footnotemark> Given what defendants <em>did </em>disclose in the December 1 Release, there was no such obvious duty to disclose the FDA Letter. Therefore, plaintiffs must allege something more to suggest that defendants <em>intended </em>to confuse the market by omitting material information from the December 1 Release.<footnotemark>81</footnotemark> For several reasons, examining plaintiffs\u2019 allegations as a whole compels the conclusion that defendants did not act <em>recklessly </em>when they issued the December 1 Release.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-13\"><em>First, </em>the tenuous plausibility of the alleged scheme substantially weakens the overall strength of plaintiffs\u2019 scienter allegations.<footnotemark>82</footnotemark> Although I have now found that the alleged scheme had a marginal chance of success, plaintiffs\u2019 theory of the case is still internally inconsistent.<footnotemark>83</footnotemark> ^ Plaintiffs assert that;</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>In the end, it was the enormous trading volume and the unprecedented 150% stock price increase that caused reporters to take notice [of the December 1 Release] and ultimately dig deeper. Absent the one or two persistent reporters that decided to challenge Defendants\u2019 statements and to press the FDA (and presumably GeoPharma) for answers, the truth may not have become known for some time.<footnotemark>84</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b485-4\">Once again, plaintiffs are mistaken. If defendants intended to mislead the market into believing that Mucotrol was a drug, and if they hoped to inflate their share price sufficiently to convert the debt into equity, they must have also realized that any dramatic increase in share price would cause reporters to \u201cdig deeper,\u201d check with the FDA,<footnotemark>85</footnotemark> and quickly uncover the scheme. Indeed, in this instance, the 150% increase in share price attracted sufficient media attention that the December 1 Release was clarified, and the inflated stock price dissipated, within hours.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-5\"><em>Second </em>plaintiffs also allege that the use of the word \u201cformula\u201d to describe Mucotrol in the December 1 Release \u201creinforced the market\u2019s belief that Mucotrol was a drug ... and can only lead to a stronger inference that Defendants did not merely innocently overlook the import of a single word.\u201d<footnotemark>86</footnotemark> However, as defendants note, \u201cif the language defendants\u2019 used ... in the December 1[ ] Release can be probative of intent, then surely it is conclusively exonerating that defendants also said [in the December 1 Release] that Mucotrol only \u2018manages\u2019 mucositis\u2014a description that, on plaintiffs\u2019 [own] allegations, definitively [signals to investors] that Mucotrol could not be a drug.\u201d<footnotemark>87</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b485-8\">Indeed, the Complaint notes that \u201ctopical palliative agents, such as Mucotrol, [ ] are only able to help <em>manage </em>infections and pain resulting from mild-to-moderate oral mucositis ... whereas a <em>drug </em>actually treats the oral mucositis.\u201d<footnotemark>88</footnotemark> Given the apparently clear distinction between \u201cmanage\u201d and \u201ctreat,\u201d the use of the former term in the December 1 Release suggests that defendants were forthright in disclosing that they had not obtained approval for a <em>drug </em>that treats mucositis.<footnotemark>89</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b486-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>Finally, GeoPharma was not <em>hiding </em>anything from the market when it issued the December 1 Release, which drew the market\u2019s attention to the very source of information (the FDA) that would \u201cunravel\u201d the entire scheme. The true nature <em>of </em>the FDA approval of Mucotrol was reasonably available to the public on December 1, and for this reason as well it is difficult to find strong circumstantial evidence of recklessness, especially when GeoPharma promptly issued a new press release, and scheduled a conference call, once the confusion caused by the December 1 Release became apparent.<footnotemark>90</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b486-4\">In sum, defendants had no clear duty to disclose the information in the FDA Letter as part of the December 1 Release. Thus, without more, the failure to disclose this information cannot constitute reckless behavior.<footnotemark>91</footnotemark> Rather, the most that can be inferred from this omission is that defendants were negligent in failing to anticipate how the market would respond to the prescription product statement. To infer scienter from an arguably material omission, in the face of allegations that cut against such an inference, and in the absence of valid motive allegations, would be to expand the anti-fraud provisions of the securities laws beyond their intended scope.<footnotemark>92</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b486-9\">b. Market Potential Statement</p>\n<p id=\"b486-10\">Plaintiffs also argue that the market potential statement in the December 1 Release was false and/or misleading. In the September 30 Opinion, I held that the market potential statement was not actionable because it was either; (1) a forward-looking projection of revenues, protected by the PSLRA\u2019s safe harbor as plaintiffs failed to plead that it was made with actual knowledge of its falsity;<footnotemark>93</footnotemark> or (2) that it was a true statement of the total present <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>market for all products that address mucositis in any way. Although plaintiffs allege in their Complaint that the statement was a revenue projection,<footnotemark>94</footnotemark> they argue in their opposition to the motion to dismiss that the market projection was a statement of present fact, whether or not knowable with certainty.<footnotemark>95</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b487-5\">Whichever it is, plaintiffs argue that they have alleged that defendants acted with the requisite intent to deceive based on admissions by defendants that they had not yet attempted to estimate Mucotrol\u2019s <em>revenues </em>at the time they issued the December 1 Release.<footnotemark>96</footnotemark> Defendants, not surprisingly, agree that they had no basis to estimate revenues. They argue, however, that this is irrelevant because the statement is properly read not as a revenue projection, but as an accurate factual statement about the total size of the market for <em>all </em>mucositis products.<footnotemark>97</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b487-6\">Given the full context of the December 1 Release, and the complete transcript of the December 2 conference call provided in the Amended Complaint, plaintiffs\u2019 interpretation of the statement is not reasonable, even when viewed in the light most favorable to the plaintiffs. The market potential statement is explicitly based on the fact that \u201c[i]t is estimated that approximately 300,000 cancer patients in the U.S. suffer from mucositis associated with cancer treatments.\u201d<footnotemark>98</footnotemark> It is unreasonable to construe the statement to mean that GeoPharma expected to derive <em>revenue </em>from every one of those patients. As I noted during oral argument, \u201cFord Motor [Company] could say \u2018if I sold every car in the country, there are 300 million car purchasers, that\u2019s how many sales there would be, but that\u2019s not [a] revenue projection because nobody thinks everybody is going to buy a Ford.\u201d<footnotemark>99</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b487-12\">During oral argument, plaintiffs struggled to articulate exactly how they viewed the market potential statement, finally settling on \u201cthe size of the potential market for Mucotrol sales.\u201d<footnotemark>100</footnotemark> However, this is nothing more than a revenue projection by another name. Even if the potential market is a statement of present fact, plaintiffs have still not supported their allegation that this statement is either false or misleading. While plaintiffs allege that defendants lacked a reasonable basis for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>potential market statement,<footnotemark>101</footnotemark> the basis was provided by the Release\u2019s recitation of the total number of mucositis sufferers, a figure plaintiffs do not dispute. Because this statement is neither false nor misleading, it is not actionable.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-4\">c. Failure to Disclose Competing Mtedical Devices</p>\n<p id=\"b488-5\">Because plaintiffs did not amend their allegations, they simply reassert their argument that GeoPharma\u2019s failure to disclose the existence of other medical devices managing mucositis in the December 1 Release was misleading.<footnotemark>102</footnotemark> This argument was fully addressed (and rejected) in the September 30 Opinion, and there is no reason to address it again.<footnotemark>103</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b488-6\">d. Other Scienter Allegations</p>\n<p id=\"b488-7\">Plaintiffs make several other scienter allegations not covered by the foregoing discussion. These allegations do not speak directly to defendants\u2019 intent in making the prescription product statement, but instead charge defendants with generally suspicious conduct outside the putative class period. However, even these allegations do not satisfy the required pleading standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-14\">Plaintiffs first allege that scienter is established by defendants\u2019 failure to disclose, prior <em>to </em>the start of the class period on December 1, that Mucotrol had evolved from a drug into a medical device.<footnotemark>104</footnotemark> GeoPharma\u2019s last public statement regarding a mucositis product before the December 1 Release, referring to a drug, was in August 2004. In September 2004, however, GeoPharma applied to the FDA for approval as a medical device. \u201cDefendants\u2019 decision to allow untrue and misleading information to remain in the market for at least four and a half months is probative of scienter.\u201d<footnotemark>105</footnotemark> But plaintiffs fail to explain why an alleged actionable omission <em>prior </em>to the class period adequately alleges scienter as to a statement <em>during </em>the class period.<footnotemark>106</footnotemark> Moreover, plaintiffs\u2019 related allegation that GeoPharma violated its duty to disclose the FDA Letter within four days of its receipt on November 24 is mistaken.<footnotemark>107</footnotemark> GeoPharma <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>complied with the relevant SEC regulation, which requires disclosure within four <em>business </em>days of a \u201cmaterial corporate event.\u201d <footnotemark>108</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b489-4\">Moving farther afield, plaintiffs make several allegations regarding GeoPharma\u2019s \u201cprior history of making inaccurate representations in order to capitalize on health fears.\u201d<footnotemark>109</footnotemark> Plaintiffs also allege that a member of GeoPharma\u2019s Board of Directors resigned without explanation on December 3, 2004.<footnotemark>110</footnotemark> However, plaintiffs barely mention these allegations in their opposition brief,<footnotemark>111</footnotemark> and in light of the overall weakness of the scienter inference created by the Amended Complaint, these allegations are unavailing.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-5\">B. Group Pleading Doctrine</p>\n<p id=\"b489-6\">One issue remains which I will briefly address for the sake of completeness, although it is admittedly <em>dicta </em>given plaintiffs\u2019 failure to allege scienter.<footnotemark>112</footnotemark> In the first Complaint, plaintiffs failed to make any specific allegations against defendant Jugal Taneja. Bather, plaintiffs invoked the \u201cgroup pleading doctrine,\u201d which allows reliance on \u201ca presumption that statements in ... press releases, or other group-published information, are the collective work of those individuals with direct involvement in the everyday business of the company.\u201d <footnotemark>113</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b489-11\">Although quite limited in scope, this doctrine may apply to outside directors such as Jugal Taneja, who \u201ccan fall within the group pleading presumption when, by virtue of their status or a special relationship with the corporation, they have access to information more akin to a corporate insider.\u201d<footnotemark>114</footnotemark> However, the September 30 Opinion held that \u201c[a] bare allegation that Jugal Taneja is Chairman of the Board, in the absence of any specific allegation that he played a role in the preparation of the December 1 Release, or otherwise took part in the day-to-day operations of GeoPharma, does not justify applying the group pleading doctrine.\u201d<footnotemark>115</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b490-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>In the opposition brief to the first motion to dismiss, plaintiffs introduced several new facts regarding Jugal Taneja. Specifically, plaintiffs asserted that (1) Jugal Taneja is a large GeoPharma shareholder; (2) he is the father of defendant Mihir Taneja; (3) he signed a Form 10-K referenced in the Complaint; and (4) he had a consulting agreement with GeoPharma. While noting that a complaint cannot be amended by the opposition brief to a motion to dismiss, I opined that \u201cit is unlikely that these new facts would establish that Jugal Taneja had a hand in the preparation of the December 1 Release, or had a special relationship with GeoPharma giving rise to an inference that he had access to information akin to a corporate insider \u00bb <footnotemark>116</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b490-4\">The facts introduced in plaintiffs\u2019 first opposition brief are now included in the amended complaint.<footnotemark>117</footnotemark> Notably, plaintiffs allege that Jugal Taneja had a consulting agreement with GeoPharma for which he was paid $200,000 per year\u2014exceeding the <em>salaries </em>of both of the other individual defendants, the highest officers in the company.<footnotemark>118</footnotemark> Plaintiffs also specify that Jugal Taneja owns 31% of GeoPharma common stock.<footnotemark>119</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b490-11\">On this basis, plaintiffs have now succeeded in bringing Jugal Taneja within the scope of the group pleading doctrine. In <em>Schnall v. Annuity &amp; Life Re (Holdings), Ltd., </em>the court applied the group pleading doctrine to a Chairman of the Board, active in company affairs, who also had a significant consulting agreement with the company, and who often signed SEC Form 10-K\u2019s for the defendant company.<footnotemark>120</footnotemark> Now that plaintiffs have alleged that Jugal Taneja owned almost one third of GeoPharma\u2019s stock, he also can be compared to the defendant from <em>In re Independent Energy Holdings, </em>where I held that a co-founder and largest shareholder of the defendant company was within the group pleading doctrine.<footnotemark>121</footnotemark> While Jugal Taneja is not alleged to have taken part in the preparation of the December 1 Release, the Complaint\u2019s allegations of his large ownership share, combined with a consulting agreement that pays him more than any employee of the company, give rise to the inference that he has a sufficient special relationship to GeoPharma to apply the group pleading doctrine.<footnotemark>122</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b490-12\">C. Leave to Amend</p>\n<p id=\"b490-13\">Although plaintiffs again request leave to amend, further amendment would be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>pointless. Having already been given the opportunity to replead, plaintiffs, who are represented by highly experienced counsel, have surely presented all relevant facts by now, and have twice failed to plead scienter.<footnotemark>123</footnotemark> Accordingly, the Amended Complaint is dismissed with prejudice.<footnotemark>124</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b491-5\">D. Rule 11</p>\n<p id=\"b491-6\">Upon final adjudication of a securities fraud action, the PSLRA requires the court to make findings regarding each attorney\u2019s compliance with Rule 11(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.<footnotemark>125</footnotemark> As this Opinion and Order constitutes a \u201cfinal adjudication\u201d within the meaning of the PSLRA, I must make the required findings. Based on a preliminary review of the record, I do not believe that Rule 11 was violated in this case. Plaintiffs\u2019 contentions, although ultimately unsuccessful, were objectively reasonable and supported by colorable interpretations of existing precedent.<footnotemark>126</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b491-7\">Defendants may request the imposition of sanctions within ten days of the date of this Opinion and Order.<footnotemark>127</footnotemark> If such a request is made, plaintiffs need respond only if directed by the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-12\">VI. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b491-13\">For the foregoing reasons, defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss is granted, with prejudice. The Clerk of the Court is directed to close the pending motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-14\">SO ORDERED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b474-12\">. <em>Rothman v.
