After review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-17\">Following his arrest in a reverse-sting operation, Calderon pleaded guilty to conspiracy to affect commerce by robbery, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1951(a); conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute five or more kilograms of cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 846 and 841 (b)(1)(A)(ii); and knowing possession of a firearm in furtherance of a crime of violence and a drug-trafficking crime, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 924(c)(1)(A). The district court sentenced Calderon to a total of 180 months\u2019 imprisonment. Calderon now appeals, arguing that the district court erred when it failed to dismiss his case <em>sua sponte </em>because his prosecution was the result of outrageous governmental conduct that violated his right to due process.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b243-18\">Calderon never raised this issue before the district court. Generally, \u201cnon-jurisdictional arguments \u2018alleging a defect in instituting the prosecution\u2019 are waived unless raised by motion prior to trial, absent good cause for the failure.\u201d <em>United States v. Augustin, </em>661 F.3d 1105, 1122 n. 10 (11th Cir.2011) (quoting Fed.R.Crim.P. 12(b)(3)(A)), <em>petition for cert. filed, </em>(U.S. Mar. 29, 2012) (No. 11-9636). But we have nonetheless assumed that, \u201cwhere an outrageous governmental conduct chal<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>lenge was not raised\u201d before the district court, \u201cwe may still review the issue for plain error on appeal.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>United States v. Kelly, </em>888 F.2d 732, 739 &amp; n. 2 (11th Cir.1989)).</p>\n<p id=\"b244-4\">A defendant may show plain error only by establishing that \u201c(1) an error occurred, (2)the error was plain, and (3) the error affected substantial rights.\u201d <em>United States v. Castro, </em>455 F.3d 1249, 1253 (11th Cir.2006) (internal quotation marks omitted). \u201cAs we have repeatedly recognized, an error cannot meet the \u2018plain\u2019 requirement of the plain error rule if it is not clear under current law.\u201d <em>United States v. Chau, </em>426 F.3d 1318, 1322 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b244-6\">Calderon concedes that \u201cthis Circuit has binding precedent upholding the constitutionality of this type of reverse sting.\u201d Indeed, this court has never held that a reverse-sting operation resulted from outrageous governmental conduct that violated a defendant\u2019s due process rights. <em>United States v. Jayyousi, </em>657 F.3d 1085, 1111 (11th Cir.2011), <em>petition for cert. filed, </em>(U.S. Apr. 2, 2012) (Nos.11-1194, 11-1198, 11-9672). Calderon therefore cannot establish that any error by the district court in failing to dismiss his case <em>sua sponte </em>was plain.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b243-13\">. Calderon\u2019s guilty plea was unconditional, and such a plea generally results in waiver of all non-jurisdictional challenges to a conviction. <em>Wilson v. United States, </em>962 F.2d 996, 997 (ilth Cir.1992). Here, however, the government did not raise the issue of waiver. We therefore do not address it. <em>See United States v. Lall, </em>607 F.3d 1277, 1290 (11th Cir.2010) (declining to apply waiver to a defendant\u2019s challenge of the admissibility of a confession on appeal because the government did not argue that the issue had been waived).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
