The officers argue that they are entitled to summary judgment based on qualified immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-18\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-19\">Travis and Carolyn Bailey traveled to Miami, Florida, for vacation. After checking in to a hotel, Ms. Bailey went to the room and her son went for a walk. During Travis Bailey\u2019s walk, Miami Police Officer Alexander Torres stopped him and asked him about his identity, where he was from, and where he was staying. During the stop, Officer Torres received notice over the radio that Travis Bailey had an outstanding traffic warrant in North Carolina. Travis Bailey got scared and ran away.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-20\">Officer Torres called for backup, and several officers searched for Travis Bailey by using his driver\u2019s license and a hotel room key card that he left behind when he fled. After an hour of searching, the officers went to the hotel where Travis Bailey <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>was staying with his mother. The hotel clerk confirmed that the key was for room 603, which was registered to a guest named \u201cBailey.\u201d Officers Wayne Hol-brook, Dimitri Gotsis, and Jose Reina then went to that room. Officer Gotsis also brought his police dog.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b221-5\">The officers knocked on the door to room 608, announced themselves as police, and requested entry. Ms. Bailey opened the door with its chain still secured and looked out to confirm who was there. Without incident or delay, Ms. Bailey closed the door, removed the chain, and opened the door. The officers told her that they were looking for Travis Bailey and asked where he was. Ms. Bailey raised her hands and said \u201cDuh\u201d because her son was standing next to the bed, wearing only his underwear, with his hands raised in surrender. Officers Reina and Holbrook then rushed toward Travis Bailey and put him in handcuffs. One of the officers screamed \u201cGet that F\u2019ing bitch out of this room now,\u201d and Ms. Bailey was pushed into the hallway.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-6\">Officers Reina and Holbrook then beat Travis Bailey with a police baton for two to three minutes, striking him fifteen times in the head, back, thighs, and legs. Officer Gotsis stood inside the room the entire time, watching the beating and holding his police dog. Although he had a clear and unobstructed view of the entire incident, Officer Gotsis never told Officers Reina and Holbrook to stop, never attempted to physically stop them, and never used his radio to request assistance.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-7\">The three officers eventually removed Travis Bailey from the room and put him in a police ear. They then returned to the room and arrested Ms. Bailey for obstruction of justice and resisting an officer without violence. The charges against Ms. Bailey were later dropped.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-10\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-11\">Ms. Bailey and her son filed suit against Officers Holbrook, Reina, Torres, Gotsis, and the City of Miami Beach, making various civil rights claims under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, a common law claim of battery, and a common law claim of false arrest. The officers moved for partial summary judgment on most of the claims on the basis of qualified immunity, though they conceded only for summary judgment purposes that there was sufficient evidence to establish that Officers Holbrook and Reina used excessive force when arresting Travis Bailey. The district court granted the summary judgment motion on some of the claims, but denied it with respect to (1) Travis Bailey\u2019s claim against Officer Dimi-tri Gotsis for failure to intervene during the beating; and (2) Ms. Bailey\u2019s claim against Officer Jose Reina for unlawful arrest. The court reasoned that summary judgment was inappropriate for those two claims because the evidence, when construed in the light most favorable to Ms. Bailey and her son, could establish that the officers violated clearly established constitutional rights. The officers then filed this interlocutory appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-12\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-13\">\u201cWe review <em>de novo </em>the denial of a motion for summary judgment based on qualified immunity.\u201d <em>Roberts v. Spielman, </em>643 F.3d 899, 902 (11th Cir.2011). \u201cSummary judgment is appropriate when the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>pleadings, the discovery and disclosure materials on file, and any affidavits show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d <em>Jean-Baptiste v. Gutierrez, </em>627 F.3d 816, 820 (11th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b222-4\">The doctrine of qualified immunity shields from civil liability police officers and other government officials performing discretionary functions \u201cinsofar as their conduct does not violate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known\u201d at the time of the alleged misconduct. <em>Harlow v. Fitzgerald, </em>457 U.S. 800, 818, 102 S.Ct. 2727, 2738, 73 L.Ed.2d 396 (1982). To determine whether the doctrine applies, we consider \u201c(1) if the facts, construed in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, show that a constitutional right has been violated; and (2) whether the right violated was clearly established.\u201d <em>Roberts, </em>643 F.3d at 904 (quotation marks and alteration omitted). \u201c[W]e are free to consider these elements in either sequence....\u201d <em>Youmans v. Gagnon, </em>626 F.3d 557, 562 (11th Cir.2010) (citing <em>Pearson v. Callahan, </em>555 U.S. 223, 236, 129 S.Ct. 808, 818, 172 L.Ed.2d 565 (2009)).</p>\n<p id=\"b222-5\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-6\">Officer Gotsis argues that he is entitled to qualified immunity on Travis Bailey\u2019s failure to intervene claim because he did not have a reasonable opportunity to stop Officers Holbrook and Reina from using excessive force. It is clearly established in this Circuit \u201cthat an officer who is present at the scene and who fails to take reasonable steps to protect the victim of another officer\u2019s use of excessive force, can be held liable for his nonfeasance.\u201d <em>Velazquez v. City of Hialeah, </em>484 F.3d 1340, 1341-42 (11th Cir.2007) (quotation marks omitted). \u201cBut it must also be true that the non-intervening officer was in a position to intervene yet failed to do so.\u201d <em>Hadley v. Gutierrez, </em>526 F.3d 1324, 1331 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b222-8\">The facts of this case are similar to the facts in <em>Priester v. City of Riviera Beach, Florida, </em>208 F.3d 919 (11th Cir.2000). There, two officers chased a burglary suspect to a canal, where the suspect surrendered, lying down on the ground. <em>Id. </em>at 923. Even though the suspect had fully complied with the officers\u2019 commands, one of the officers ordered his police dog to attack the suspect. <em>Id. </em>at 923-24. The second officer watched the incident from the top of the canal and did nothing to stop the attack. <em>Id. </em>at 925. When the arrestee brought suit against the second officer for failing to intervene, we held that the officer was not entitled to qualified immunity because \u201cthe dog\u2019s attack on Plaintiff may have lasted as long as <em>two minutes </em>... [, which] was long enough for a reasonable jury to conclude that [the officer] had time to intervene and to order [the first officer] to restrain the dog.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 925 (emphasis in original). The officer violated the arres-tee\u2019s clearly established rights by watching \u201cthe entire event\u201d while \u201cin voice contact\u201d with the first officer and doing nothing to stop the dog attack. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b222-9\">The same thing happened here, except it is alleged that officers directly, instead of indirectly through a police dog, did the attacking. Officer Gotsis watched for two to three minutes as Officers Holbrook and Reina attacked Travis Bailey, violating his constitutional rights. Just like the second officer in <em>Priester, </em>Officer Gotsis \u201cobserved the entire attack and had the time and ability to intervene, but he did nothing.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 927. Officer Gotsis was \u201cin voice contact\u201d with the other officers and had plenty of time to order them to stop the attack, but he instead chose to stand by and watch them hit Travis Bailey with a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>baton fifteen times. \u201cNo particularized case law was necessary for a reasonable police officer to know that, on the facts of this case and given that the duty to intervene was clearly established, he should have intervened.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b223-5\">Officer Gotsis argues, however, that he had no reasonable opportunity to intervene because he was too occupied controlling his agitated police dog. Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to Travis Bailey, however, Officer Gotsis was able to do <em>something </em>to stop the alleged beating, even if he also had to restrain his dog. The beating lasted for two to three minutes. Controlling the dog may have prevented Officer Gotsis from physically stopping the attack, but he could have demanded that the other two officers stop or, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, he could have used his radio to call for help. At the very least, Officer Gotsis\u2019 claim that he could do <em>nothing </em>because he was holding the dog creates a dispute of material fact that should be resolved by a jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-6\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-7\">We now turn to Officer Reina\u2019s argument that the district court should have granted summary judgment in his favor on Ms. Bailey\u2019s wrongful arrest claim because he had arguable probable cause to make the arrest. It is clearly established that \u201can arrest without probable cause violates the right to be free from an unreasonable search under the Fourth Amendment.\u201d <em>Durruthy v. Pastor, </em>351 F.3d 1080, 1088 (11th Cir.2003). A police officer is entitled to qualified immunity for making an arrest if he had \u201carguable probable cause\u201d to make the arrest. <em>Scarbrough v. Myles, </em>245 F.3d 1299, 1302 (11th Cir.2001) (emphasis and quotation marks omitted); <em>see also Jones v. Cannon, </em>174 F.3d 1271, 1283 (11th Cir.1999). \u201cArguable probable cause exists if, under all of the facts and circumstances, an officer reasonably could \u2014 not necessarily would \u2014 have believed that probable cause was present.\u201d <em>Crosby v. Monroe Cnty., </em>394 F.3d 1328, 1332 (11th Cir.2004). When performing our arguable probable cause analysis, we look at the information known to the officer at the time of the arrest. <em>Jones, </em>174 F.3d at 1283 n. 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-9\">Accepting as true Ms. Bailey\u2019s version of the facts, as we must at this stage of proceedings, Officer Reina did not have arguable probable cause to arrest her. When the three officers arrived at room 603, they knew only that the room was registered to \u201cBailey\u201d and that Travis Bailey might be inside. The officers did not know Ms. Bailey was in the room until she opened the door, and when she opened the door, she complied with all of the officers\u2019 instructions and left the room without resistance. Those alleged facts establish only that she was in a room with someone suspected of committing a crime elsewhere, which is not enough to create arguable probable cause for arrest. <em>See Holmes v. Kucynda, </em>321 F.3d 1069, 1081 (11th Cir.2003) (\u201cThis circuit\u2019s case law has clearly established that mere presence at the scene of a crime, without more, does not support a finding of probable cause to arrest.\u201d (quotation marks and alteration omitted)); cf. <em>Ybarra v. Illinois, </em>444 U.S. 85, 91, 100 S.Ct. 338, 342, 62 L.Ed.2d 238 (1979) (\u201c[A] person\u2019s mere propinquity to others independently suspected of criminal activity does not, without more, give rise to probable cause to search that person.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b223-10\">Officer Reina argues that he had arguable probable cause to believe that Ms. Bailey was helping her son escape capture because she knew that her son was running from the police, and yet she failed to call the police to report his whereabouts and was found harboring him in a hotel <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>room. Those assertions, however, assume that Ms. Bailey knew her son was running from the police, and the record is clear that, when he arrested her, Officer Reina did not know whether she was aware that her son had been chased by the police. Here again, we are left only with the fact that Ms. Bailey was in a room with her son about an hour after his encounter with Officer Torres, and that fact alone did not create arguable probable cause for her arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-4\">Officer Reina also asserts that he had arguable probable cause to arrest Ms. Bailey because she had helped her son avoid arrest by initially opening the door with the latch engaged. He argues that \u201cthere is no plausible reason for Carolyn to have kept the latch engaged in initially opening the door,\u201d and even describes her \u201clatching the door\u201d as \u201cunlawful conduct.\u201d Ms. Bailey, however, testified in her deposition that she kept the door latched until confirming the identity of the men who were banging on the door and yelling \u201copen this F-ing door now,\u201d and once she confirmed that the men banging on the door were police officers, she immediately removed the latch and let the officers inside. Assuming that her testimony is true, nothing about that chain of events gave Officer Reina arguable probable cause to arrest Ms. Bailey.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-5\">Finally, Officer Reina claims he had arguable probable cause to arrest Ms. Bailey because she lied about whether her son was in the hotel room and because she attempted to obstruct the officers when they tried to enter the room. She has testified to the contrary, however, and at this stage of proceedings we must accept her version of events. Given her testimony, and viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to Ms. Bailey, Officer Reina did not have arguable probable cause to arrest her for any offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b221-8\">. The parties dispute what happened next, but when reviewing the denial of a motion for summary judgment based on qualified immunity, \"we make no credibility determinations or choose between conflicting testimony, but instead accept [plaintiffs\u2019] version of the facts drawing all justifiable inferences in [their] favor.\u201d <em>Burnette v, Taylor, </em>533 F.3d 1325, 1330 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
