He argues that the district court erred by imposing an upward departure, failing to provide adequate reasons supporting that departure, denying his request for a downward variance or departure, and failing to provide him with any notice that the court was considering an upward departure. In the Statement of Reasons, the district court clarified that the imposed sentence was outside the advisory Guidelines system and was therefore a variance. <em>See United States v. Jacobs, </em>635 F.3d 778, 780 n. 1 (5th Cir.2011). To the extent that the parties\u2019 arguments assume that the sentence was based upon an upward departure, those arguments are not applicable and are construed as referencing the upward variance, where possible. Because the sentence was based upon an upward variance, Ramirez\u2019s challenge to the absence of notice lacks merit. <em>See Irizarry v. United States, </em>553 U.S. 708, 716, 128 S.Ct. 2198, 171 L.Ed.2d 28 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b43-15\">Sentences are reviewed for reasonableness in light of the sentencing factors in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). <em>United States v. Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d 357, 360 (5th Cir.2009). Ramirez requested a downward variance prior to sentencing, but he did not object to his sentence on any ground in district court. Nevertheless, his sentence may be affirmed regardless of whether he preserved his challenge to the reasonableness of his sentence. <em>See United States v. Argueta-Lopez, </em>326 Fed. Appx. 265, 266 (5th Cir.2009). Although Ramirez\u2019s criminal history was accounted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>for in the guidelines sentence range, the district court was allowed to consider his prior criminal conduct, including uncounted prior convictions, as a basis for an upward variance. <em>See United States v. Brantley, </em>537 F.3d 347, 350 (5th Cir.2008). The district court made the required individualized assessment and was free to conclude that, in Ramirez\u2019s case, the guidelines range gave insufficient weight to some of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, including the nature and circumstances of the offense, Ramirez\u2019s history and characteristics, and the need to protect the public from further crimes. <em>See United States v. Williams, </em>517 F.3d 801, 809 (5th Cir.2008). Ramirez has not shown that the district court erred by denying his request for a downward variance or departure based upon his daughter\u2019s illness. The imposed sentence, which was six months greater than the highest sentence that could have been imposed under Ramirez\u2019s advisory guidelines range, was not substantively unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-4\">The district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b43-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
