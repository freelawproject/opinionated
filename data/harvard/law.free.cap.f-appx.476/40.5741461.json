Because we agree with the district court\u2019s conclusion that Harrison failed to establish a prima facie case for his claims, we affirm the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-17\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b67-18\">Harrison, an African-American, is currently employed by CCA as a detention officer at its Houston Processing Center. CCA hired Harrison as a detention officer in 2004, and in 2006, he was transferred to the maintenance department. Harrison\u2019s claims of race discrimination and retaliation originate from actions alleged to have taken place in 2008 while he was working in the maintenance department. He alleges that, at that time, another CCA employee, Louis Story, directed a racial slur at him in the presence of another CCA employee, Fred Carlos.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-19\">In the grievance Harrison submitted on May 21, 2008, he complained that Story had said, \u201cHello my nigger friend, I\u2019m pimping you!\u201d CCA conducted an investigation and confirmed that the incident had occurred. CCA\u2019s Grievance Response indicated that the \u201ccomment came about after a long period of \u2018inappropriate bantering\u2019 among those involved.\u201d In response to the investigation, Warden Robert Lacy Jr. recommended that Story be suspended for three days and undergo additional training. On June 10, 2008, Warden Lacy communicated the results of the investigation and his recommendations to Harrison. Instead of filing a step two grievance disagreeing with the results of the investigation, on August 1, 2008, Harrison filed a Charge of Discrimination with the EEOC in which he alleged that CCA engaged in race discrimination and retaliation.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-20\">Sometime after April 2009, Harrison was transferred from the maintenance de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>partment to his current position as a detention officer. CCA asserts that this transfer occurred after an annual quality-assurance audit resulted in poor results for the maintenance department. According to CCA, all maintenance staff at the time were relieved of their duties and were offered transfers to detention officer positions. Harrison accepted the transfer, and he was paid the same salary as he received while working in the maintenance department.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-4\">On December 18, 2009, the EEOC issued a Dismissal and Notice of Rights indicating that, based on its investigation, it was unable to conclude that the information it had obtained established a statutory violation. Subsequently, on February 17, 2010, Harrison filed suit against CCA in state court alleging race discrimination and retaliation in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Texas Commission on Human Rights Act (TCHRA).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Eventually the case was removed to federal court. CCA filed a motion for summary judgment to which Harrison did not respond, and the district court granted the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-5\">The district court analyzed Harrison\u2019s Title VII and TCHRA claims concurrently because the law governing each is identical regarding the issues under consideration.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Applying the <em>McDonnell Douglas </em>burden-shifting framework, the district court held that Harrison\u2019s claims of race discrimination and retaliation could not survive the motion for summary judgment because Harrison failed to establish a prima facie case on either claim. The district court held that, with respect to both claims, Harrison failed to show that he was subject to an adverse employment action, and with respect to the race-discrimination claim, he also failed to allege any facts demonstrating that others similarly situated were treated more favorably. In doing so, the district court noted that summary judgment may not be awarded by default. Instead, the district court emphasized that the movant, CCA, had the burden to demonstrate the absence of a genuine issue of material fact whether any response was filed. Harrison filed a motion for new trial, which was denied, and this appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-10\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b68-11\">As an initial matter, Harrison is mistaken when he argues on appeal that the district court did not resolve his claims under the TCHRA. The district court expressly indicated that it was analyzing his Title VII and TCHRA claims concurrently.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The district court\u2019s approach was correct because claims under each of these statutes are generally treated the same.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We will follow the same approach as the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-12\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b68-13\">We review the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment de novo, using the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>same standards as the district court.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Summary judgment shall be granted \u201cif the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b69-5\">The <em>McDonnell Douglas </em>burden-shifting framework applies to Harrison\u2019s race discrimination and retaliation claims because they are based on circumstantial evidence.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Under the first step of the <em>McDonnell Douglas </em>framework, the plaintiff must establish a prima facie case.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> After the plaintiff establishes a prima facie case, the burden \u201cshift[s] to the employer to articulate some legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for the [action].\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Finally, if the employer meets that burden, the plaintiff \u201cmust ... be afforded a fair opportunity to show that [the] stated reason for [the action] was in fact pretext.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> We conclude that the district court correctly granted summary judgment on Harrison\u2019s claims of race discrimination and retaliation because the record does not include evidence that would establish a prima facie case of either claim, and therefore CCA is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-12\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b69-13\">Title VII makes it \u201can unlawful employment practice for an employer ... to discharge any individual, or otherwise to discriminate against any individual with respect to his compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment, because of such individual\u2019s race, color, religion, sex, or national origin.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> To establish a prima facie case of discrimination under Title VII, a plaintiff must show that he: \u201c(1) is a member of a protected class; (2) was qualified for [his] position; (3) was subject to an adverse employment action; and (4) was replaced by someone outside the protected class, or, in the case of disparate treatment, shows that others similarly situated were treated more favorably.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b69-14\">With respect to claims of discrimination, in accordance with Title VII\u2019s language, our precedent only recognizes ultimate employment decisions such as hiring, granting leave, discharging, promoting, or compensating as actionable adverse employment actions.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> A review of the summary-judgment record reveals no evidence that Harrison was subjected to an ultimate employment decision of this sort.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> There <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>is evidence in the record showing that Harrison was subjected to a racial slur by a CCA employee and that he overheard racial comments in his workplace prior to this incident, but these do not constitute actionable adverse employment actions because they are not the equivalent of the ultimate employment decisions listed above. Consequently, Harrison did not establish a prima facie case of race discrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-4\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b70-5\">Title VII also makes it \u201can unlawful employment practice for an employer to discriminate against any of his employees ... because [the employee] has opposed any practice made an unlawful employment practice.\u201d <footnotemark>15</footnotemark> \u201cTo establish a prima facie case of retaliation, the plaintiff must establish that: (1) he participated in an activity protected by Title VII; (2) his employer took an adverse employment action against him; and (3) a causal connection exists between the protected activity and the adverse employment action.\u201d <footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b70-6\">Because the language of the anti-discrimination and anti-retaliation provisions differ, an adverse employment action is defined differently for each provision.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> With respect to a claim of retaliation, \u201ca plaintiff must show that a reasonable employee would have found the challenged action materially adverse, which in this context means it well might have dissuaded a reasonable worker from making or supporting a charge of discrimination.\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Materiality is required in order \u201cto separate significant from trivial harms,\u201d and a reasonable-employee standard is used \u201cbecause ... the provision\u2019s standard for judging harm must be objective.\u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> \u201c[T]he significance of any given act of retaliation will often depend upon the particular circumstances.\u201d<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b70-15\">Harrison\u2019s original petition asserted that two actions constituted unlawful retaliation: he claimed (1) he was reprimanded for actions for which other CCA employees were not reprimanded, and (2) he was transferred from the maintenance department. We conclude that a reasonable employee would not find either of these actions materially adverse. Therefore, Harrison did not establish a prima facie case of retaliation.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-16\">1</p>\n<p id=\"b70-17\">While the record indicates that Harrison may have been reprimanded, the reprimands evidenced in the record would not dissuade a reasonable worker from making or supporting a charge of discrimination. In his deposition, Harrison claimed that he, unlike other employees, was verbally counseled for not reporting every thirty minutes. He also claimed in his deposition that he received bad evaluations and was reprimanded for misplacing a tool, although he considered his three-day suspension for misplacing the tool to be fair. A reasonable employee would not be dissuaded by a reprimand and punishment he considered to be fair. Furthermore, we conclude that the verbal repri<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>mands and generic bad evaluations in this case, evidenced only by Harrison\u2019s brief deposition answers, are nothing more than \u201ctrivial harms,\u201d which the materiality requirement is intended to separate from significant harms.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Because the reprimands evidenced in the record would not dissuade a reasonable worker from making or supporting a charge of discrimination, they do not constitute an adverse employment action as required to establish a pri-ma facie ease of retaliation.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-4\">2</p>\n<p id=\"b71-5\">Additionally, the summary-judgment record does not contain evidence sufficient to show that Harrison\u2019s transfer constituted an adverse employment action as required to establish a prima facie case of retaliation. Viewed in Harrison\u2019s favor, the evidence indicates that: Harrison and two other officers were moved from the maintenance department to detention officer positions; other than being told that Assistant Warden Price wanted to change \u2014 or try something new in \u2014 the maintenance department, Harrison was not told anything about the reasons for his transfer; and the transfer was lateral, paying the same salary as Harrison received in the maintenance department. There is no record evidence to support Harrison\u2019s claims, raised in his appellate brief, that the maintenance department position offered more opportunities for promotion and salary increases, that detention officers were terminated more frequently, or that a reasonable employee would view the detention officer position as less satisfactory and fulfilling.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-11\">\u201cWe have recognized previously that \u2018a lateral reassignment to a position with equal pay could amount to a materially adverse action in some circumstances,\u2019 \u201d but this depends on the facts of the particular case, which must be judged from the perspective of a reasonable employee.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Without record evidence to show that the detention officer position offered less opportunities for promotion or salary increases, involved a greater likelihood of termination, or the like, Harrison cannot show that a reasonable employee would have found the lateral transfer at the same salary to be materially adverse.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Therefore, Harrison\u2019s transfer does not constitute an adverse employment action as required to establish a prima facie case of retaliation.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-12\">3</p>\n<p id=\"b71-13\">On appeal, Harrison also argues that CCA retaliated against him by means of \u201ca flagrant and indecent attempt to lure [him] into a sexual situation, so that, once caught <em>in flagrante delicto, </em>he could be fired\u201d and \u201c[tjhreats to the jobs of [himself] and others because of the civil rights complaint.\u201d These arguments were not made to the district court, and they do not appear in Harrison\u2019s original petition. Accordingly, these arguments are waived as we will not consider arguments made for the first time on appeal.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b72-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>The decision of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b67-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
