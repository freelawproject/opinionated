United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 131 S.Ct. 18, 178 L.Ed.2d 348 (2010). The district court dismissed the petition on grounds that Haynes failed to satisfy the \u201csavings clause\u201d of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b53-24\">We review the district court\u2019s dismissal on the pleadings de novo. <em>Pack v. Yusuff, </em>218 F.3d 448, 451 (5th Cir.2000). Claims relating to alleged errors in a federal sentence are properly raised in a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion rather than in a \u00a7 2241 petition. <em>Tolliver v. Dobre, </em>211 F.3d 876, 877-78 (5th Cir.2000). However, under the savings clause of \u00a7 2255(e), a \u00a7 2241 petition that attacks a federal sentence may be considered if the petitioner shows that the \u00a7 2255 remedy is \u201cinadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his detention.\u201d \u00a7 2255(e). The savings clause of \u00a7 2255 applies only to claims that are \u201cbased on a retroactively applicable Supreme Court decision which establishes that petitioner may have been convicted of a nonexistent offense\u201d and that were \u201cforeclosed by circuit law at the time when the claim should have been raised in the petitioner\u2019s trial, appeal, or first \u00a7 2255 motion.\u201d <em>Reyes-Requena v. United States, </em>243 F.3d 893, 904 (5th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b53-25\"><em>Abbott </em>does not state, as Haynes mistakenly asserts, that multiple consecutive terms of imprisonment may not be imposed for separate convictions under \u00a7 924(c). <em>See Abbott, </em>131 S.Ct. at 23 (noting that \u201ca defendant is subject to a mandatory, consecutive sentence for a \u00a7 924(c) conviction\u201d). To the contrary, the Su<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>preme Court has affirmed the imposition, in a single proceeding, of six consecutive sentences under \u00a7 924(c). <em>Deal v. United States, </em>508 U.S. 129, 132-37, 113 S.Ct. 1993, 124 L.Ed.2d 44 (1993); <em>see United States v. Thomas, </em>627 F.3d 146, 158 (5th Cir.2010) (following <em>Deal). Abbott </em>said nothing to affect <em>Deal\u2019s </em>holding that an offender charged with multiple \u00a7 924(c) offenses receives a mandatory minimum sentence for each such offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-4\">Haynes fails to show that his claim was \u201cbased on a retroactively applicable Supreme Court decision which establishes that [he] may have been convicted of a nonexistent offense.\u201d <em>Reyes-Requena, </em>243 F.3d at 904. He was therefore not entitled to bring his claim under \u00a7 2241, and the district court\u2019s dismissal is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b53-20\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
