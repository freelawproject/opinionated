Samadi challenges the denial of his motions governing discovery, the imposition of sanctions for failing to attend his deposition, and the denial of his motions to remand his action to state court and for leave to amend his complaint. Samadi also challenges the summary judgment in favor of the Bank. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-13\">The district court did not abuse its discretion when it denied Samadi\u2019s motions to compel, to extend the time for discovery, and to hold a status conference. Although we construe <em>pro se </em>filings liberally, \u201cprocedural rules in ordinary civil litigation should [not] be interpreted so as to excuse mistakes by those who proceed without counsel.\u201d <em>McNeil v. United States, </em>508 U.S. 106, 113, 113 S.Ct. 1980, 1984, 124 L.Ed.2d 21 (1993). The district court was not required to grant Samadi\u2019s motion to compel when he failed to certify that he had conferred in good faith with counsel for the Bank, Fed.R.Civ.P. 37(a)(1), or to comply with a local rule that he object with specificity to the responses of the Bank to requests for discovery, S.D. Ga. R. 26.5. The district court also was not required to extend the time for discovery a second time for Samadi to file another motion to compel after he had failed to file a corrected motion within the first extended period for discovery. <em>See Shotz v. City of Plantation, Fla., </em>344 F.3d 1161, 1184 n. 35 (11th Cir.2003). There was no need for the district court to conduct a status conference to resolve Samadi\u2019s grievance with the Bank regarding discovery when Samadi refused to avail himself of procedures for resolving his grievance. <em>See Holloman v. Mail-Well Corp., </em>443 F.3d 832, 843-44 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b847-14\">The district court acted within its discretion by sanctioning Samadi for failing to attend his deposition. \u201c[A]ll federal courts have the power, by statute, by rule, and by common law, to impose sanctions against recalcitrant ... parties litigant.\u201d <em>Carlucci v. Piper Aircraft Corp., </em>775 F.2d 1440, 1446 (11th Cir.1985). Samadi refused to make himself available for a deposition within the time for discovery and, after receiving notice of the date scheduled, he refused to appear unless he received materials that he had requested in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"822\">*822</page-number>two discovery requests. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 37(d)(1). Samadi argues that he was not required to appear because of discovery misconduct by the Bank, but the record supports the decision of the district court that Samadi\u2019s dispute with the Bank did not \u201csubstantially justif[y]\u201d his failure to appear. <em>Id. </em>37(d)(8). As a result, the district court was entitled to order Samadi to \u201cpay the reasonable expenses, including attorney\u2019s fees,\u201d incurred by the Bank as a result of Samadi\u2019s absence. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b848-4\">Samadi challenges the reasonableness of the expenses, but we cannot say that the district court \u201c \u2018committed a clear error of judgment\u2019 \u201d when it awarded the $2,283.85 that the Bank requested in its revised statement of fees and costs. <em>Josendis v. Wall to Wall Residence Repairs, Inc., </em>662 F.3d 1292, 1313 (11th Cir.2011) (quoting <em>Dorey v. Dorey, </em>609 F.2d 1128, 1135-36 (5th Cir.1980)). The district court ordered the Bank to revise its first statement of $4,400, and the Bank complied with that order by including in its revised statement only its expenses related to attempting to depose Samadi and preparing a motion for sanctions.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-5\">The district court also did not abuse its discretion by denying as untimely Samadi\u2019s motions to remand his action to state court and for leave to amend his complaint. Samadi moved to remand this action over six months after the Bank removed it to the district court. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1447(c). And Samadi did not request leave to amend his complaint until after the deadline for discovery and pretrial pleadings had expired and after the Bank had moved for summary judgment. <em>See Lowe\u2019s Home Ctrs., Inc. v. Olin Corp., </em>313 F.3d 1307, 1314-15 (11th Cir.2002). A plaintiff must have \u201cgood cause for belatedly amending [his] complaint,\u201d <em>Sosa v. Airprint Sys., Inc., </em>133 F.3d 1417, 1418 (11th Cir.1998); see Fed.R.Civ.P. 16(b)(4), but Samadi sought to withdraw his federal claims to defeat federal jurisdiction and to avoid an unfavorable summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-7\">The district court did not err by granting summary judgment in favor of the Bank and against Samadi\u2019s claims under the Truth in Lending Act. To be subject to regulation under the Lending Act, the Bank must have extended Samadi, as a \u201cconsumer,\u201d credit to be used \u201cprimarily for personal, family, or household purposes.\u201d 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1602(i). Samadi argues that he obtained two lines of credit for consumer purposes, as evidenced by his \u201cpersonal information and signature\u201d on the loan documents and the lack of a \u201crestriction [on] the use of [the] funds\u201d by the Bank. But the record establishes that Samadi used the lines of credit \u201cprimarily for business, [or] commercial ... purposes,\u201d which are exempt from the Lending Act. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1603(1). Samadi, a real estate investor, testified that he had intended to \u201cborrow money against ... [his] line of credit ... to purchase another property\u201d for investment; to use the \u201cfunds ... to do repairs on ... properties\u201d; and to add a business partner, Bradley Kirkland, as a guarantor on the lines of credit to \u201cimprove his [credit] score.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b848-8\">The district court also did not err by granting summary judgment in favor of the Bank and against Samadi\u2019s claim under the Fair Credit Reporting Act. The Reporting Act imposes on entities that furnish information to consumer reporting agencies duties to review and investigate the accuracy of its information and to report any errors. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1681a(f), 1681s-2. Samadi complained that the Bank had violated the Reporting Act in three ways: (1) denying applications to add Kirkland to the lines of credit; (2) reducing one of Samadi\u2019s lines of credit without notifying him; and (3) reporting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"823\">*823</page-number>and failing to correct information about Samadi\u2019s two lines of credit. Samadi\u2019s first two complaints failed to state a claim under the Reporting Act, and Samadi failed to establish that a genuine issue of fact existed that the Bank had breached any duty when reporting information about Samadi\u2019s lines of credit. After the Bank learned about a dispute regarding information it had provided to Experian regarding Samadi\u2019s lines of credit, the Bank investigated and determined that its information was accurate. Samadi argues that the Bank should have reported his lines of credit using different terminology, but the reports were in accordance with the credit agreements that Samadi signed, which governed the terms and conditions of his lines of credit.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-5\">We AFFIRM the summary judgment in favor of the Bank.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
