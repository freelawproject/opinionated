Ruiz contends that the fine is unreasonable because, as the presentence report (PSR) determined, he does not have the ability to pay the fine given the economic conditions in Honduras. He also asserts, for the first time on appeal, that the fine is unreasonable because the Guidelines fine table is not grounded in the proper empirical data.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-16\">We review a sentencing decision for \u201creasonableness,\u201d applying the abuse-of-discretion standard. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 46, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007); <em>Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 351, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007). The Guidelines state that \u201c[t]he court shall impose a fine in all cases, except where the defendant establishes that he is unable to pay and is not likely to become able to pay any fine.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5E1.2(a); <em>see United States v. Fair, </em>979 F.2d 1037, 1040 (5th Cir.1992). The defendant bears the burden of proving that he is unable to pay a fine, and he may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>use the PSR as proof of inability to pay. <em>United States v. Magnuson, </em>307 F.3d 333, 335 (5th Cir.2002). If the district court adopts the PSR but \u201cchooses to disregard the [PSR\u2019s] recommendation [on fines], it must make specific findings regarding the defendant\u2019s ability to pay a fine.\u201d <em>United States v. Landerman, </em>167 F.3d 895, 899 (5th Cir.1999) (citing <em>Fair, </em>979 F.2d at 1041).</p>\n<p id=\"b48-4\">In the instant case, the district court did not reject or depart from the adopted PSR\u2019s recommendation on a fine, and as a result, the court was not required to make specific findings regarding Ruiz\u2019s ability to pay the fine. Unlike the PSR in <em>Fair, </em>which explicitly stated that the defendant lacked either the present or the future capacity to pay a fine, <em>see Fair, </em>979 F.2d at 1040, the PSR here determined only that based on Ruiz\u2019s \u201cpresent financial status, it does not appear he has the ability to pay a fine.\u201d The district court\u2019s imposition of a fine payable in the future, therefore, did not contravene the PSR\u2019s recommendation. <em>Cf. United States v. Brantley, </em>537 F.3d 347, 352 (5th Cir.2008). Moreover, Ruiz\u2019s unreasonableness argument focuses on his inability to pay the fine once he is deported to Honduras, which he asserts has a much lower standard of living than the United States. However, the district court allowed for the possibility of any future hardships by ordering that the payment amount could either be increased or decreased depending on Ruiz\u2019s ability to pay. Under these circumstances, the district court did not abuse its discretion by imposing the fine. <em>See United States v. Altamirano, </em>11 F.3d 52, 53-54 (5th Cir.1993); <em>United States v. Matovsky, </em>935 F.2d 719, 723 (5th Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b48-5\">Ruiz raised his empirical data argument for the first time in his reply brief. This court ordinarily does not consider such arguments. <em>United States v. Ramirez, </em>557 F.3d 200, 203 (5th Cir.2009); <em>United States v. Aguirre-Villa, </em>460 F.3d 681, 683 n. 2 (5th Cir.2006). Moreover, the argument is subject to plain error review only. <em>See United States v. Campos-Maldonado, </em>531 F.3d 337, 339 (5th Cir.2008). We have consistently held that we will not second guess a within-guidelines sentence simply because the district court did not undertake an analysis of the empirical data underlying each guideline provision or because the particular guideline provision at issue is not empirically-based. <em>See United States v. Duarte, </em>569 F.3d 528, 530 (5th Cir.2009); <em>United States v. Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d 357, 367 (5th Cir.2009). Accordingly, Ruiz cannot show any error, plain or otherwise. Ruiz\u2019s convictions and sentences are AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b47-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
