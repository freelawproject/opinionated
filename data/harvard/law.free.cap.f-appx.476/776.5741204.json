Rodriguez\u2019s sole argument on appeal is that the district court misapplied the Sentencing Guidelines <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"777\">*777</page-number>when it imposed an eight-level increase in his offense level under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(C). We review Rodriguez\u2019s argument de novo. <em>See United States v. Landeros-Arreola, </em>260 F.3d 407, 410 (5th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b803-5\">Rodriguez argues that his conviction for attempted felon in possession of a firearm does not qualify as an aggravated felony under \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(C) and comment, (n. 5) because the Texas concept of \u201cattempt\u201d is broader than the generic, contemporary meaning of attempt. He further argues that the Texas has not adopted the \u201csubstantial step\u201d test of the Model Penal Code and that Texas\u2019s approach instead provides for a more broad test.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-6\">Rodriguez\u2019s arguments have been specifically rejected by this court in <em>United States v. Sanchez, </em>667 F.3d 555, 563-66 (5th Cir.2012). Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b802-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"777\">*777</page-number>published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
