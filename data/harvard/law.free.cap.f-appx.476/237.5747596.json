On appeal, Frazier argues that the district court\u2019s order failed to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>indicate whether the court\u2019s denial was based on lack of authority to reduce his sentence or as an exercise of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-4\">A district court may modify a term of imprisonment in the case of a defendant who was sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). Any reduction must be \u201cconsistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Amendment 750 to the Sentencing Guidelines amended the drug quantity table in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c) to reduce offense levels in crack cocaine cases by two levels. <em>See </em>U.S.S.GApp. C, Amend. 750 (2011).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b264-5\">In deciding a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion, our precedent makes clear that \u201cthe court must recalculate the sentence under the amended guidelines, first determining a new base level by substituting the amended guideline range for the originally applied guidelines range, and then using that new base level to determine what ultimate sentence it would have imposed.\u201d <em>United States v. Bravo, </em>203 F.3d 778, 780 (11th Cir.2000). The court must then decide, after analyzing the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, whether to impose the amended sentence on the defendant. <em>Id. </em>at 781.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-6\">Here, the district court\u2019s order consisted of a pre-written form that contained the following language:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-7\">Upon motion of Q the defendant \u25a1 the Director of the Bureau of Prisons \u25a1 the court under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) for a reduction in the term of imprisonment imposed based on a guideline sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered and made retroactive by the United States Sentencing Commission pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 994(u), and having considered such motion, and taking into account the policy statement set forth at USSG \u00a7 1B1.10 and the sentencing factors set for th in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), to the extent they are applicable, IT IS ORDERED THAT the motion is: \u25a1 DENIED ...</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b264-10\">There is no indication on this form that the court actually conducted the required recalculation under the amended guidelines. Furthermore, while it is true that the district court need not \u201carticulate specifically the applicability \u2014 if any \u2014 of each of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors,\u201d \u201cthe record [must] demonstrate[ ] that the pertinent factors were taken into account by the district court.\u201d <em>United States v. Eggersdorf, </em>126 F.3d 1318, 1322 (11th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b264-11\">Upon review of the record and consideration of the parties\u2019 briefs, we therefore vacate and remand for the district court to conduct the required recalculation.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-12\">VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b264-8\">. Amendment 750 was made retroactive by Amendment 759, effective November 1, 2011. See <em>id.., </em>Amend. 759 (2011). Amendment 750 is listed in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1BI.10(c).
