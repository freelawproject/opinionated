The district court dismissed Enax\u2019s complaint for failure to state a claim. After review, we conclude the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to reach the merits of Enax\u2019s claim and remand for the entry of an order dismissing Enax\u2019s complaint on that ground.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b884-8\">I. BACKGROUND FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b884-9\">Enax\u2019s complaint alleged that beginning January 2007, the IRS levied over fifteen percent of his social security benefit, in violation of 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6331(h). On March 30, 2010, Enax sent a certified letter to the local Taxpayer Advocate Service and to the IRS demanding that \u201cthe IRS discontinue any and all levies\u201d of his social security benefit checks in excess of fifteen percent and \u201crefund all those monies taken in excess\u201d of fifteen percent. However, the IRS continued to levy his social security benefit. Enax\u2019s complaint sought an order: (1) finding that the IRS violated the law when it took more than fifteen percent of Enax\u2019s social security benefit; (2) prohibiting the IRS from levying more than fifteen percent of Enax\u2019s social security benefit in future; and (3) requiring the IRS to \u201crefund all those monies taken in excess of\u2019 fifteen percent, plus interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-13\">The IRS filed a motion to dismiss, arguing, <em>inter alia, </em>that the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction because Enax had failed to plead an applicable waiver of sovereign immunity and did not comply with the prerequisites of a tax refund suit. The district court granted the IRS\u2019s motion to dismiss. Although the district court stated that the IRS\u2019s jurisdictional argument had merit, it dismissed Enax\u2019s complaint because it concluded that the IRS may levy in excess of fifteen percent of an individual\u2019s social security benefit payments. The district court denied Enax\u2019s subsequent motion for reconsideration and request to file a brief in opposition to the IRS\u2019s motion to dismiss.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Enax appealed.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b885-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"859\">*859</page-number>II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b885-5\">The United States has sovereign immunity from suit unless it consents to be sued, and the statute consenting to suit \u201cdefine[s] [the district] court\u2019s jurisdiction to entertain the suit.\u201d <em>Christian Coalition of Fla., Inc. v. United States, </em>662 F.3d 1182, 1188 (11th Cir.2011) (quotation marks omitted). Under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1346(a), the district court has original jurisdiction to hear a civil action against the United States \u201cfor the recovery of any internal-revenue tax alleged to have been erroneously or illegally assessed or collected, or any penalty claims to have been collected without authority or any sum alleged to have been excessive or in any manner wrongfully collected under the internal-revenue laws[.]\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1346(a). However, before a taxpayer may bring such an action against the IRS, the taxpayer must first file an administrative claim with the IRS for a refund or credit \u201caccording to the provisions of law in that regard\u201d and any applicable regulations. 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7422(a); <em>see also </em>26 C.F.R. \u00a7 301.6402-2(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b885-6\">These requirements include, <em>inter alia, </em>the full payment of all taxes owed to the IRS. <em>Flora v. United States, </em>357 U.S. 63, 68, 78 S.Ct. 1079, 1083, 2 L.Ed.2d 1165 (1958), <em>aff'd on reh\u2019g, </em>362 U.S. 145, 80 S.Ct. 630, 4 L.Ed.2d 623 (1960). In addition, the administrative claim must be \u201cverified by a written declaration\u201d; set forth \u201cin detail each ground upon which a credit or refund is claimed and facts sufficient to apprise the Commissioner of the exact basis\u201d of the claim; and use the appropriate tax refund form. 26 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 301.6402-2(b), 301.6402-3(a). The administrative claim also must be filed within three years of the filing of the return or within two years of the tax being paid. 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6511(a); <em>Wachovia Bank, N.A. v. United States, </em>455 F.3d 1261, 1269 (11th Cir.2006). If the taxpayer does not comply with these requirements, the district court does not have jurisdiction to entertain the tax refund suit. <em>Id. </em>at 1264.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-9\">Here, Enax does not contend that he complied with any of these requirements before filing his tax refund suit. Specifically, Enax does not claim he paid the full sum of taxes owed, and, indeed, his request to prevent the IRS from taking more than fifteen percent of his social security benefits going forward indicates that he has not done so. Although Enax wrote a letter to the IRS, he did not file a verified administrative claim using the proper tax refund form. Moreover, to the extent his March 10, 2010 letter was an attempt to file an administrative claim, it appears to have been untimely given that Enax\u2019s social security benefits were levied by January 2007, over three years earlier.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-10\">Enax argues that Congress waived sovereign immunity by enacting 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7433, which provides a civil action for \u201cactual, direct economic damages\u201d resulting from an unauthorized collection action. <em>See </em>26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7433(a), (b)(1). The problem for Enax is that his complaint did not seek actual damages or allege that he had incurred any actual pecuniary losses as a result of the allegedly improper collection of taxes. <em>See </em>26 C.F.R. \u00a7 301.7433-l(b) (defining \u201cactual, direct economic damages\u201d as \u201cactual pecuniary damages sustained by the taxpayer as the proximate result of the reckless or intentional, or negligent, actions\u201d of the IRS).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Instead, Enax sought to recover those allegedly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"860\">*860</page-number>improperly collected taxes from his social security benefit, i.e., a tax refund suit. <em>See </em>26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7422(a) (defining a tax refund suit as one \u201cfor the recovery of any internal revenue tax alleged to have been erroneously or illegally assessed or collected\u201d); <em>see also </em>26 C.F.R. \u00a7 301.6331-1 (providing authority to IRS district directors to collect unpaid taxes by levy). Before bringing such a tax refund suit, Enax was required to exhaust his claim administratively, and his failure to do so barred the district court from entertaining it.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b886-4\">Where the district court lacks subject matter jurisdiction, \u201cit ha[s] no power to render a judgment on the merits.\u201d <em>Crotwell v. Hockman-Lewis Ltd., </em>734 F.2d 767, 769 (11th Cir.1984). Accordingly, we vacate the district court\u2019s judgment and remand for the district court to dismiss Enax\u2019s complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b886-7\">VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b884-10\">. We review <em>de novo </em>whether the district court had subject matter jurisdiction. <em>Adventure Outdoors, Inc. v. Bloomberg, </em>552 F.3d 1290, 1294 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b884-11\">. Given that the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction, we find no reversible error in the district court\u2019s granting of the IRS\u2019s motion to dismiss before Enax could file a brief in opposition. <em>See Chudasama v. Mazda Motor Corp., </em>123 F.3d 1353, 1366-67 (11th Cir.1997) (explaining that the district court does not abuse its discretion in managing its docket where the litigant\u2019s rights are not materially prejudiced).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b884-15\">.Although Enax\u2019s <em>pro se </em>notice of appeal specified that he was appealing the district court\u2019s February 11, 2011 order denying his motion for reconsideration, it is overwhelmingly clear from his appellate brief that he also intended to appeal the district court\u2019s January 14, 2011 order dismissing his complaint and January 18, 2011 judgment. <em>See KH Outdoor, LLC v. City of Trussville, </em>465 F.3d 1256, 1260 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b885-7\">. Enax never asked to amend his complaint to assert a damages claim and does not argue on appeal that the district court should have allowed him to do so before dismissing his complaint. <em>See Timson v. Sampson, </em>518 F.3d 870, 874 (11th Cir.2008) (stating that issues not raised in <em>pro se </em>litigant\u2019s brief are abandoned).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b886-5\">. To the extent Enax sought prospective declaratory or injunctive relief, his claims were barred by the Anti-Injunction Act, 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7421, and the federal tax exemption to the Declaratory Judgment Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2201(a), and, thus, the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over those claims as well. See <em>Christian Coalition of Fla., Inc. v. United States, </em>662 F.3d 1182, 1190-94 (11th Cir.2011).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b886-10\">. Enax\u2019s motion to file a reply brief out of time is granted.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
