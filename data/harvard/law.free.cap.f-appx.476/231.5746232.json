He argues the district court erred in imposing a career offender enhancement pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1, because his 1999 conviction under Fla. Stat. \u00a7 817.563 for selling a counterfeit controlled substance was not a predicate controlled substance offense. Specifically, he argues that because the conviction was for the sale of fake cocaine, it involved neither a controlled substance nor a counterfeit substance.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-5\">The district court did not err in finding Mims\u2019s 1999 conviction was a predicate controlled substance offense, as we have already held, in <em>United States v. Frazier, </em>89 F.3d 1501, 1505 (11th Cir.1996), that a conviction under Fla. Stat. \u00a7 817.563 was a predicate offense for career offender sentencing purposes. Not only was Mims convicted of the same offense as the <em>Frazier </em>defendant, he was also engaged in the same offense conduct (namely, the sale of fake/simulated cocaine). Therefore, applying the prior precedent rule, <em>Frazier </em>controls the instant case. <em>See United States v. Smith, </em>122 F.3d 1355, 1359 (11th Cir.1997) (noting that under the prior panel precedent rule, we are bound by earlier panel holdings \u201cunless and until they are overruled <em>en banc </em>or by the Supreme Court\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b258-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
