As this issue has been raised for the first time on appeal, we review it for plain error only. <em>Puckett v. United States, </em>556 U.S. 129, 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009). When, as here, criminal proceedings had not yet been instituted, the witness had no constitutional right to have counsel present during the grand jury proceeding. <em>Fuller v. Johnson, </em>158 F.3d 903, 907-08 (5th Cir.1998). No error has been shown, plain or otherwise. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b323-6\">Holder complains that, by \u201crequiring both sides to use blind strikes,\u201d the district court deprived him of one of his peremptory strikes because both the defense and the government struck the same juror. As the use of blind strikes has been approved by this court, Holder cannot show that the district court abused its discretion. <em>See United States v. Durham, </em>587 F.2d 799, 801 (5th Cir.1979); <em>United States v. Sarris, </em>632 F.2d 1341, 1343 (5th Cir.1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b323-7\">Holder asserts that the district court erred in admitting his signed statement into evidence because the statement was involuntarily given in connection with a polygraph examination that was not administered in accordance with FBI policies and procedures. The government made a proffer regarding the manner in which the polygraph examination was conducted. Based on that evidence, we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in excluding details of the polygraph examination and in admitting the signed statement that resulted from the examination. <em>See United States v. El-Mezain, </em>664 F.3d 467, 494 (5th Cir.2011). The polygraph examiner\u2019s alleged failure to follow FBI guidelines does not provide Holder a basis for challenging his conviction. <em>See United States v. Cooks, </em>589 F.3d 173, 184 (5th Cir.2009). The district court did not clearly err in finding that Holder\u2019s signed statement was voluntarily given. <em>See Nunez-Sanchez, </em>478 F.3d at 666. <em>United States v. Nunez-Sanchez, </em>478 F.3d 663, 666 (5th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b323-11\">Holder contends that the district court abused its discretion by overruling his hearsay objection to admission of out-of-court statements of his coconspirator and that the government improperly referred to the hearsay statements in its opening statement. The district court did not abuse its discretion in determining that the coconspirator\u2019s out-of-court statements were admissible. <em>See El-Mezain, </em>664 F.3d at 502; Fed.R.Evid. 801(d)(2)(E). As the evidence was admissible, the district court did not plainly err in permitting the prosecutor to refer to those statements in her opening argument. <em>Puckett, </em>556 U.S. at 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-12\">Holder claims that the district court erred by limiting his cross examination of the FBI\u2019s polygraph examiner and case agent. Holder has not shown, and the record does not reflect, that the district court\u2019s rulings limited him in any material way from attempting to undermine the agents\u2019 testimony. <em>See United States v. McCullough, </em>631 F.3d 783, 790 (5th Cir.2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b324-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>Holder asserts that the district court erred in denying his motion to dismiss the conspiracy charge based on the acquittal of his coconspirator. No error has been shown in this regard. <em>See United States v. Zuniga-Salinas, </em>952 F.2d 876, 877-79 (5th Cir.1992) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b324-4\">Holder complains that several government witnesses who testified in the first trial were not available to testify in the second trial. The record does not reflect whether Holder subpoenaed the witnesses or why he did not call them as witnesses. No error on the part of the district court has been shown. As the record has not been developed, we shall not consider Holder\u2019s related ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim on direct appeal. <em>See United States v. Cantwell, </em>470 F.3d 1087, 1091 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b324-5\">Holder contends that the district court erred in denying his motion for a mistrial after a government informant gave non-responsive testimony during cross examination about the manner in which he had generated cash to pay Holder and the manner in which he determined the total amount of those payments. Holder claims that, having denied the motion, the district court erred in failing to strike the non-responsive testimony and in failing to give him additional time in which to prepare his cross examination of the informant. Holder has failed to show that the district court abused its discretion in this respect. <em>See United States v. Lucas, </em>516 F.3d 316, 345 (5th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b324-6\">Holder urges that the district court erred in instructing the jury with regard to the tax-evasion charges. We review this question for plain error. <em>See Puckett, </em>556 U.S. at 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423. As the district court\u2019s instruction was consistent with the pattern jury instruction of the trial courts of this circuit, no error is apparent, plain or otherwise. <em>See United States v. Whitfield, </em>590 F.3d 325, 354 (5th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b324-8\">In a related contention, Holder complains that the verdicts in his first trial were inconsistent. The fact that the jury\u2019s verdict was inconsistent does not necessarily undermine the conviction. <em>See United States v. Dubea, </em>612 F.2d 950, 951 (5th Cir.1980). \u201cWhere a multi-count verdict appears inconsistent, the appellate inquiry is limited to a determination whether the evidence is legally sufficient to support the counts on which a conviction is returned.\u201d <em>Id. </em>No error has been shown. <em>See id.; see also United States v. Mann, </em>161 F.3d 840, 848 (5th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b324-9\">We have not considered several spurious arguments raised for the first time in Holder\u2019s reply brief. <em>See United States v. Aguire-Villa, </em>460 F.3d 681, 683 n. 2 (5th Cir.2006). Neither have we considered any issues raised in the original brief that have been inadequately briefed. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 28(a)(9)(A); <em>see also Grant v. Cuellar, </em>59 F.3d 523, 524 (5th Cir.1995). The judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b322-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
