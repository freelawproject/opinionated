After thorough review of the parties\u2019 arguments, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-9\">Appellants (\u201cOwners\u201d) own property in a beachfront condominium complex in Des-tin, Florida. They allege that members of the public have come up from the public beach area, and entered upon their private beachfront properties, and have remained there after receiving notice to leave. This unauthorized entrance by the public constitutes a trespass under Florida law. <em>See </em>Fla. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 810.09(l)(a). Owners have therefore sought the assistance of local law enforcement in removing the trespassing members of the public. However, pursuant to City policy, the Sheriffs Office will not enforce trespass laws within twenty feet of the wet sand\u2019s edge \u2014 an area which, depending on the tide, encroaches on Owners\u2019 property. As a result of this policy, Owners have been unable to secure the assistance of local law enforcement officials to enforce trespass laws on their beachfront property, despite their repeated attempts to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-11\">Owners filed a complaint in district court against the City of Destin, the May- or of Destin, and the Okaloosa County Sheriff under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, alleging deprivation of procedural due process and violation of their rights to equal protection of the law. The City, Mayor and Sheriff filed motions to dismiss pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6). The district court granted the motions to dismiss, ruling that Owners had failed to allege deprivation of a constitutionally protected liberty or property interest to substantiate their due process claim. As to the equal protection claim, the district court held that Owners failed to identify a similarly situated comparator.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-12\">This Court reviews a district court\u2019s dismissal under Rule 12(b)(6) <em>de novo, </em>accepting the allegations in the complaint as true. <em>Mills v. Foremost Ins. Co., </em>511 F.3d 1300, 1303 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b208-13\">In order to successfully state a claim for deprivation of due process, a party must show: \u201c[1] deprivation of a constitutionally-protected liberty or property interest; [2] state action; and [3] constitutionally inadequate process.\u201d <em>Cryder v. Oxendine, </em>24 F.3d 175, 177 (11th Cir.1994). Owners argue that the district court erred by not finding a property right. In particular, they contend that \u201ca fundamental element of the rights attendant to private property is the right to exclude others,\u201d and that Florida law reflects this right in its trespass statute, Fla. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 810.09. They further argue that enactment of the City\u2019s twenty-foot policy \u201cprohibits enforcement of [their] right to exclude through ordinary recourse to law enforcement,\u201d and constitutes <em>\u201cde facto </em>authoriza<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>tion for beachgoers to use those areas for their own purposes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b209-5\">We begin by analyzing the allegation that the twenty-foot policy has denied Owners the right to exclude others from their property. <em>See Kaiser Aetna v. United States, </em>444 U.S. 164, 176, 100 S.Ct. 383, 391, 62 L.Ed.2d 332 (1979) (defining \u201cright to exclude others\u201d as \u201cone of the most essential sticks in the bundle of [property] rights\u201d). Based upon the facts as pleaded, we cannot accept this allegation. Owners have not alleged that the City has actually abrogated their right to exclude members of the public from their property. As the district court noted, they \u201chave been free at all times to exclude individuals from their property through any lawful means they choose.\u201d Owners argue that the district court erred, because their factual allegations establish an absence of other lawful means to exclude members of the public. We cannot agree. Owners have not alleged that the City has in any way barred their access to private remedies, such as filing a civil suit<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> against trespassers, or establishing private security measures. In the absence of an allegation that the City has actually abrogated Owners\u2019 right to exclude members of the public from their land, we are left only with the allegation that the City has refused to protect their property interests.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b209-9\">The Supreme Court has explicitly refused to recognize a substantive due process right to governmental aid or protection, except in a few limited circumstances,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> even when governmental aid is necessary to protect liberty or property interests from private interference. <em>See DeShaney v. Winnebago Cnty. Dep\u2019t of Soc. Servs., </em>489 U.S. 189, 201-02, 109 S.Ct. 998, 1006-07, 103 L.Ed.2d 249 (1989). More recently, the Court considered whether a party may assert a claim for deprivation of procedural due process, based upon a state\u2019s failure to protect liberty or property interests in <em>Town of Castle Rock, Colo. v. Gonzales, </em>545 U.S. 748, 125 S.Ct. 2796, 162 L.Ed.2d 658 (2005). The Supreme Court looked to the relevant state law to determine whether it established a property or liberty interest in governmental aid or assistance, and held that no such interest existed. <em>Id. </em>at 768, 125 S.Ct. at 2810 (\u201c[T]he benefit that a third party may receive from having someone else arrested for a crime generally does not trigger protections under the Due Process Clause, neither in its procedural <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>nor in its \u2018substantive\u2019 manifestations.\u201d). In accordance with this precedent, we now examine whether Florida law guarantees Owners a property interest in police assistance to prevent members of the public from trespassing on their land. We conclude that it does not.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-4\">Florida law provides that the offense of trespass is \u201ca misdemeanor of the first degree, punishable\u201d under Florida law. Fla. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 810.09(2)(b). However, Florida law in no way requires that police execute an arrest in the event of trespass, or otherwise aid the property owner. Therefore, we conclude that the manner in which the City and Sheriffs Office choose to enforce \u00a7 810.09 remains subject to their discretion. <em>Cf. Town of Castle Rock, </em>545 U.S. at 759, 761, 125 S.Ct. at 2805-06 (rejecting argument that Colorado statute stating, \u201ca peace officer shall arrest,\u201d displaced a \u201ctradition of police discretion\u201d under state law). \u201c[A] benefit is not a protected entitlement if government officials may grant or deny it in their discretion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 756, 125 S.Ct. at 2803. Owners also point to a statement of the Attorney General of Florida declaring that property owners \u201cmay make complaints of trespass to local law enforcement officers as they occur,\u201d as additional evidence supporting them claimed property interest. However, even accepting that this statement is an authoritative source of Florida law, it does little to establish that law enforcement officials are obligated under Florida law to follow up on any trespass complaints. Therefore, we agree with the district court that Owners lack a cognizable property interest under Florida law in law enforcement of trespass laws.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Having concluded that Owners do not have a constitutionally protected property or liberty interest at stake, we also conclude that they failed to state a due process claim, and we need not address the remaining elements of their claim. <em>See Cook v. Sheriff of Monroe Cnty., Fla., </em>402 F.3d 1092, 1117 n. 9 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b210-7\">For their equal protection claim, Owners argue that the district court erred by not finding them similarly situated to other property owners in the City of Dest\u00edn. Specifically, Owners claim that the lower court erroneously applied the \u201cclass of one\u201d equal protection test from <em>Campbell v. Rainbow City, Ala., </em>434 F.3d 1306 (11th Cir.2006),<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> instead of the allegedly less stringent equal protection test from <em>Strickland v. Alderman, </em>74 F.3d 260, 264 (11th Cir.1996).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> But we do not read the tests applied in <em>Strickland </em>and <em>Campbell </em>to be different. In fact, in construing a \u201cclass of one\u201d equal protection claim, <em>Campbell </em>relied heavily on <em>Strickland </em>for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>authority, lumping <em>Strickland </em>into that category of equal protection claims relating to persons who are not members of a \u201cvulnerable class.\u201d <em>Campbell, </em>434 F.3d at 1313-14.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-5\">In any event, the distinction Owners seek to make is one without a difference. Under either case, they must establish that they are being treated differently than a similarly situated comparator, which they have failed to do. <em>See Strickland, </em>74 F.3d at 264; <em>Campbell, </em>434 F.3d at 1314. In their complaint, Owners allege that \u201cthey are not protected by law enforcement in the same manner as[] <em>all other landowners in the City.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added). However, \u201c[djifferent treatment of dissimilarly situated persons does not violate the Equal Protection Clause.\u201d <em>Strickland, </em>74 F.3d at 265 (quotation marks omitted). As the City and Sheriff\u2019s Office have argued, and we agree, beachfront property is different from non-breachfront property under Florida law. <em>See City of Daytona Beach v. Tona-Rama, Inc., </em>294 So.2d 73, 75 (Fla.1974). And under both <em>Strickland </em>and <em>Campbell, </em>satisfaction of the similarly situated prong requires a high degree of specificity. <em>See Campbell, </em>434 F.3d at 1314 (holding that comparator must be \u201cidentical in all relevant respects\u201d); <em>Strickland </em>74 F.3d at 264-65 (noting that water drained slower from plaintiffs property for purposes of enforcement of standing water ordinance). Appellants, as owners of beachfront condominiums, therefore, cannot allege that they are similarly situated to <em>every </em>landowner in the City and expect to meet that high burden of specificity. Having failed to establish the first element of their equal protection claim, we need not address the remaining elements of Owners\u2019 equal protection claim. <em>See Cook, </em>402 F.3d at 1117 n. 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-6\">For the reasons stated above, we AFFIRM the dismissal of the Owners\u2019 claims.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b209-6\">. Owners argue that a civil trespass suit is impractical because trespassers \"will neither willingly identify themselves nor volunteer to be served with process in civil suits.\u201d However, this impracticality is not the result of any state action. Therefore, it cannot be said that Appellees have denied Owners other available lawful means to exclude trespassers.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b209-7\">. To the extent that Owners have argued that the City\u2019s twenty-foot policy amounts to de facto authorization for public use of their land, the argument more closely resembles a takings claim. <em>See </em>A.A. <em>Profiles, Inc. v. City of Fort Lauderdale, </em>253 F.3d 576, 583 n. 7 (11th Cir.2001) (explaining that property taken for public use falls under the Takings Clause; property taken for invalid use falls under the Due Process Clause). While this argument may provide a viable basis for a takings claim, plaintiffs must first exhaust the remedies available in state court before asserting a federal takings claim. <em>See Agripost, LLC v. Miami-Dade Cnty., Fla., </em>525 F.3d 1049, 1052 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b209-11\">.For example, the Supreme Court has imposed an affirmative responsibility on the government under the Eighth Amendment to provide adequate medical care to incarcerated prisoners, <em>Estelle v. Gamble, </em>429 U.S. 97, 104-05, 97 S.Ct. 285, 291, 50 L.Ed.2d 251 (1976), and an affirmative duty under the Fourteenth Amendment Due Process Clause to ensure the reasonable safety of involuntarily committed mental patients, <em>Youngberg v. Romeo, </em>457 U.S. 307, 324, 102 S.Ct. 2452, 2462, 73 L.Ed.2d 28 (1982).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b210-5\">.Owners attempt to distinguish <em>DeShaney </em>and <em>Town of Castle Rock </em>by arguing that unlike those cases, which involved individual claims for police protection and governmental assistance in particular instances, they are challenging a more permanent \"selective withdrawal\u201d of law enforcement services. While the selective withdrawal of law enforcement services may be relevant to an equal protection claim, we do not find this distinction relevant to Owners\u2019 due process claim. In order to uphold the due process claim, this Court would still need to find an affirmative right to governmental assistance to prevent trespass on Owners' land, which we decline to do.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b210-8\">. The \u201cclass <em>oi one\u201d test </em>requires that a plaintiff demonstrate intentionally disparate treatment from others who are similarly situated, and that there be no rational basis for the difference. <em>Campbell, </em>434 F.3d at 1314.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b210-9\">. <em>Strickland </em>allows a plaintiff to prevail if he can demonstrate: \"(1) [he] was treated differently than similarly situated persons; and (2) the defendant unequally applied the facially neutral statute for the purpose of discriminating against the plaintiff.\u201d 74 F.3d at 264.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
