Mora, </em>275 Fed.Appx. 193 (4th Cir.2008), the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit affirmed petitioner Jose Mora\u2019s convictions in the Eastern District of Virginia on three counts of being a felon in possession of a firearm, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 922(g) and 924(a)(2), and one count of possession of a stolen firearm, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 922(j) and 924(a)(2), and Mora\u2019s total sentence of 84 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-10\">In February 2011, while incarcerated at FCI Coleman in the Middle District of Florida, Mora petitioned the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Florida to issue a writ of habeas corpus pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 ordering the Bureau of Prisons (\u201cBOP\u201d) to eliminate his classification as a sex offender based on what he says is inaccurate information contained in his presentence report (\u201cPSR\u201d). The district court, acting <em>sua sponte, </em>dismissed Mora\u2019s petition without prejudice in an order entered on March 22, 2011. In its order, the court stated that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b877-13\">\u201c[a] writ of habeas corpus is the means by which a prisoner may challenge the legality of his confinement. The essence of habeas corpus is an attack by a person in custody upon the legality of that custody, and the ... the traditional function of the writ is to secure release from illegal custody. Further, ... the BOP cannot make changes to Petitioner\u2019s PSR because it is a court document, and the BOP does not have the authority to dispute the sentence imposed by the court. As such, the Court cannot order the requested relief because the remedy is not available.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b877-14\">Mora, proceeding <em>pro se, </em>now appeals the district court\u2019s dismissal of his petition. He contends that the court erred in dismissing his petition because a \u00a7 2241 petition is the proper way for him to challenge the BOP\u2019s decision to classify him as a sex offender (based on inaccurate information in the PSR).</p>\n<p id=\"b877-15\">The availability of relief under \u00a7 2241 presents a question of law that we review <em>de novo. Darby v. Hawk-Sawyer, </em>405 F.3d 942, 944 (11th Cir.2005). Typically, a federal prisoner\u2019s collateral attacks on the validity of a federal conviction or sentence must be brought through the filing of a motion pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 in the court in which the prisoner was convicted and sentenced. <em>Sawyer v. Holder, </em>326 F.3d 1363, 1365 (11th Cir.2003). Given the language of the district court\u2019s March 22, 2011 order quoted above, it appears that the court read Mora\u2019s petition as an attack on his Eastern District of Virginia conviction or sentence \u2014 an attack Mora should present in a \u00a7 2255 motion addressed to the court in which he was convicted.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> To the extent Mora\u2019s petition seeks such relief, the district court ruled correctly.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-16\">In sum, it is only when a federal prisoner is challenging the execution of his sen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"852\">*852</page-number>tence, rather than the validity of his sentence, that he may proceed under \u00a7 2241. <em>Antonelli v. Warden, U.S.P. Atlanta, </em>542 F.3d 1848, 1351 n. 1 (11th Cir.2008). Read liberally, Mora\u2019s <em>pro se </em>petition seems to challenge the execution of his sentence; it seeks a due process hearing regarding BOP\u2019s classification of him as a sex offender. The district court, it appears, did not read the petition as seeking such relief. So that the court can proceed under the assumption that the petition challenges the BOP\u2019s execution of Mora\u2019s sentence, we vacate its March 22, 2011 order and remand the case to the district court for further consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-4\">VACATED and REMANDED.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b877-11\">. It appears that Mora previously moved that court for \u00a7 2255 relief. The court denied <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"852\">*852</page-number>relief and the Fourth Circuit denied Mora a certificate of appealability so that he could appeal the district court's decision. To file a second \u00a7 2255 motion, Mora would have to obtain authorization from the Fourth Circuit to file it. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(h).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b878-20\">. We are informed that during the pendency of this appeal, Mora was transferred from FCI Coleman to FCC Yazoo City in Yazoo City, Mississippi. On remand, the district court will have the discretion to determine whether it would be appropriate to transfer this case to the U.S. District Court whose territory includes Yazoo City.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
