Here, however, Pope\u2019s total sentence was based on the statutory mandatory minimum rather than on offense level calculations. Accordingly, Amendment 750 did not alter his guideline range. Nor does the Fair Sentencing Act provide any reason to reduce his total sentence under \u00a7 3582(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b259-20\">We review a district court\u2019s denial of a defendant\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion to reduce sentence for an abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Mills, </em>613 F.3d 1070, 1074-75 (11th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b259-21\">A district court may modify a term of imprisonment if a defendant was sentenced \u201cto a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing commission.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). If that total sentence was based on something other than offense level calculations, however, a guideline amendment would not impact his total sentence, and he would be ineligible for relief under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>Mills, </em>613 F.3d at 1076. Specifically, if the defendant\u2019s conduct triggered a statutory mandatory minimum, his total sentence was based on that minimum, not his guideline range. <em>Id. </em>Thus, the district court properly denied Pope\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-22\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
