Pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(iii), the district court assessed a 16-level enhancement to Rivera-Arroyo\u2019s offense level under the Sentencing Guidelines because he was previously removed after a conviction for a firearms offense. Rivera-Arroyo challenges the propriety of that enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-4\">The enhancement was assessed based on Rivera-Arroyo\u2019s 2008 guilty plea conviction under Tex. Penal Code \u00a7 46.05(a)(3), which prohibits a person from \u201cintentionally or knowingly possessing] ... a short-barrel firearm.\u201d Pursuant to Tex. Penal Code \u00a7 46.01(10), the definition of a \u201cshort-barrel firearm\u201d includes \u201ca shotgun with a barrel length of less than 18 inches.\u201d Rivera-Arroyo\u2019s charging document explicitly alleged that he possessed a short-barrel firearm in the form of a shotgun with a barrel length of less than 18 inches.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-5\">The 16-level enhancement under \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(iii) does not apply unless the defendant was previously convicted of a \u201cfirearms offense,\u201d which is defined, as relevant here, as \u201c[a]n offense under federal, state, or local law that prohibits the possession of a firearm described in 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 5845(a).\u201d \u00a7 2L1.2, comment, (n. l(B)(v)(II)). The firearms described in \u00a7 5845(a) include \u201c(1) a shotgun having a barrel or barrels of less than 18 inches in length; [and] (2) a weapon made from a shotgun if such weapon as modified has ... a barrel or barrels of less than 18 inches in length.\u201d \u00a7 5845(a)(1), (2).</p>\n<p id=\"b798-6\">Rivera-Arroyo acknowledges that \u00a7 46.03(a)(5) prohibits the possession of a firearm described in \u00a7 5845(a) because both statutes encompass a shotgun or modified shotgun with a barrel length of less than 18 inches. However, he argues that the enhancement was improperly assessed under the modified categorical approach stemming from <em>Taylor v. United States, </em>495 U.S. 575, 600-02, 110 S.Ct. 2143, 109 L.Ed.2d 607 (1990), and <em>Shepard v. United States, </em>544 U.S. 13, 24-26, 125 S.Ct. 1254, 161 L.Ed.2d 205 (2005). According to Rivera-Arroyo, an individual may be convicted under \u00a7 46.05(a)(3) in instances when he would not be guilty of the generic offense of possession of a short-barrel shotgun under \u00a7 2L1.2, comment. (n. l(B)(v)(II)) because, unlike the federal government and the majority of states, Texas does not require the prosecution to prove that the defendant knew the barrel length of the shotgun was less than 18 inches. Rivera-Arroyo contends that a defendant in Texas instead bears the burden of proving the affirmative defense of mistake of fact to show that he had a reasonable belief that the length of the shotgun barrel was not legally deficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-8\">We ordinarily review the district court\u2019s application of the sentencing guidelines de novo. <em>United States v. Mungia-Portillo, </em>484 F.3d 813, 815 (5th Cir.2007). Under de novo review, an error in the calculation of a defendant\u2019s guidelines range is subject to the harmless error doctrine and would be upheld \u201conly if the proponent of the sentence convincingly demonstrates both (1) that the district court would have imposed the same sentence had it not made the error, and (2) that it would have done so for the same reasons it gave at the prior sentencing.\u201d <em>United States v. Ibarrar-Luna, </em>628 F.3d 712, 713-14 (5th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b798-9\">The Government contends that the plain error standard of review applies to Rivera-Arroyo\u2019s argument because it was not preserved in the district court. While Rivera-Arroyo does not dispute that he did not raise in the district court the specific argument he presents here, he contends that his objection to the 16-level enhancement was sufficient to preserve his instant argument. Apart from challenging wheth<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"773\">*773</page-number>er the enhancement was sufficiently supported by evidence of his conviction, an issue that is not in dispute here, Rivera-Arroyo\u2019s written objection in the district court simply \u201curged that [the conviction] does not qualify as a 16 level enhancement pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2.\u201d At sentencing, his only elaboration on the substance of the objection was the following abstruse statement by defense counsel: \u201cAnd the only reason, also, is \u2018cause I know that where the law states manufactures, possesses and everything, I know that the actual charging instrument only said possess and they didn\u2019t include some of the other language. So that\u2019s why we\u2019re requesting a ruling.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b799-5\">Rivera-Arroyo\u2019s argument on the question whether his Texas conviction satisfied the definition under \u00a7 2L1.2, comment, (n. l(B)(v)(II)) receives about nine pages of legal briefing in his opening brief, discusses three state cases from the 1980s by the Texas intermediate court of appeals, and calls for a complex evaluation of whether Texas\u2019s application of its affirmative defense of mistake of fact to offenses under \u00a7 46.05(a)(3) sufficiently differs from the majority of other jurisdictions in the United States. None of that argument or case law was brought to the attention of the district court. The Government\u2019s brief contains about five pages of legal briefing contending that Rivera-Arroyo\u2019s argument fails under plain error review.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-6\">Based on Rivera-Arroyo\u2019s conclusional and vague objection, the district court could not have intuited that Rivera-Arroyo would be making the extended and specific legal argument he now presents on appeal. <em>See United States v. Castillo, </em>386 F.3d 632, 635-36 (5th Cir.2004); <em>United States v. Cabral-Castillo, </em>35 F.3d 182, 188-89 (5th Cir.1994). Rivera-Arroyo\u2019s sparse objection in the trial court was insufficient to preserve his instant substantial and specific argument, and we thus apply the plain error standard of review.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-8\">To show plain error, Rivera-Arroyo must show a forfeited error that is clear or obvious and that affects his substantial rights. <em>See Puckett v. United States, </em>556 U.S. 129, 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009). If he makes such a showing, we have the discretion to correct the error but will do so only if the error seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings. <em>See id. </em>\u201cAn error is considered plain, or obvious, only if the error is clear under existing law.\u201d <em>United States v. Salinas, </em>480 F.3d 750, 756 (5th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b799-9\">We have not decided whether an offense under \u00a7 46.05(a)(3) constitutes a firearms offense within the meaning of \u00a7 2L1.2, comment, (n. l(B)(v)(II)). Likewise, we have not addressed the specific argument that an offense under \u00a7 46.05(a)(3) does not qualify due to Texas\u2019s treatment of the affirmative defense of mistake of fact relative to violations of \u00a7 46.05(a)(3). Thus, Rivera-Arroyo\u2019s argument fails to show that any error by the district court in applying the 16-level enhancement constituted clear or obvious error. <em>See Salinas, </em>480 F.3d at 756; <em>United States v. Diaz-Diaz, </em>327 F.3d 410, 415 (5th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b799-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b797-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
