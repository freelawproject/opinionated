He has also appealed the district court\u2019s order denying his motion to alter or amend the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"765\">*765</page-number>Stout has moved to supplement the record on appeal, and he has attached documents to his brief that are not in the record. The motion is DENIED. <em>See Leonard v. Dixie Well Service &amp; Supply, Inc., </em>828 F.2d 291, 296 (5th Cir.1987). We have not considered the documents attached to Stout\u2019s brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-5\">Stout complains of the district court\u2019s denial of his motion for appointment of counsel. Stout has not shown that exceptional circumstances required appointment of counsel. <em>See Cooper v. Sheriff, Lubbock Cnty., Tex., </em>929 F.2d 1078, 1084 (5th Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b791-6\">We review de novo a district court\u2019s summary judgment dismissal of a 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 complaint for failure to exhaust. <em>Dillon v. Rogers, </em>596 F.3d 260, 266 (5th Cir.2010). The party moving for summary judgment bears the initial burden of \u201cinforming the district court of the basis for its motion, and [of] identifying those portions of [the record] which it believes demonstrate the absence of a genuine\u201d dispute as to a material fact. <em>Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, </em>477 U.S. 317, 323, 106 S.Ct. 2548, 91 L.Ed.2d 265 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b791-7\">Under the Prison Litigation Reform Act (PLRA), inmates must exhaust \u201csuch administrative remedies as are available\u201d prior to bringing a civil action. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997e(a). \u201c[F]ailure to exhaust is an affirmative defense under the PLRA, and ... inmates are not required to specially plead or demonstrate exhaustion in their complaints.\u201d <em>Jones v. Bock, </em>549 U.S. 199, 216, 127 S.Ct. 910, 166 L.Ed.2d 798 (2007). \u201cSince exhaustion is an affirmative defense, the burden is on the Appellees to demonstrate that [Stout] failed to exhaust available administrative remedies.\u201d <em>Dillon, </em>596 F.3d at 266.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-8\">Stout contended in his amended complaint that he was assaulted and seriously injured by members of a prison gang that had put a \u201chit\u201d on him. He also claimed that North-Williams, a prison guard, failed to protect him from the assault. In an affidavit submitted in support of North-Williams\u2019s motion for summary judgment, Sandra Murphy, the Texas Department of Criminal Justice Administrator of Offender Grievances, stated that she had reviewed Stout\u2019s grievance records for the period between June 2008 and April 2009 and that four Step 1 grievances were returned unprocessed to Stout because of Stout\u2019s failure to follow prison guidelines for filing grievances. The summary judgment evidence reflects that Stout failed to comply with the prison\u2019s administrative deadlines and procedural rules and that he did not completely exhaust his administrative remedies with respect to his claims against North-Williams. See <em>Woodford v. Ngo, </em>548 U.S. 81, 90-91, 126 S.Ct. 2378, 165 L.Ed.2d 368 (2006); <em>Johnson v. Johnson, </em>385 F.3d 503, 515 (5th Cir.2004). The district court did not err in granting North-Williams\u2019s motion for summary judgment. <em>See Dillon, </em>596 F.3d at 266. The judgment is affirmed in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-10\">Stout\u2019s claims against LeBlanc, who was a State Classification Committee board member, pertain to her August 13, 2007, decision denying Stout placement in safe keeping. LeBlanc asserted in her motion for summary judgment that she had \u201cfound no record independent of the pleadings that Plaintiff ha[d] filed any grievance against her, either before or after the incident in question.\u201d This statement was not verified and was not supported with an affidavit. Murphy did not state in her affidavit that she had reviewed Stout\u2019s grievance records for the period between LeBlanc\u2019s adverse decision and June 2008. LeBlanc has failed to carry her initial burden of proof as to her affirmative defense that Stout failed to exhaust his administrative remedies. <em>See Jones, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"766\">*766</page-number>549 U.S. at 216, 127 S.Ct. 910; <em>Dillon, </em>596 F.3d at 266.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-4\">Stout attached to his verified motion to alter or amend the judgment documents indicating that he filed Step 1 grievance number 2007208753 complaining of life endangerment on August 15, 2007, and that he filed a Step 2 grievance in the same matter on December 28, 2007. This new evidence indicated that there was a genuine issue of fact as to whether Stout had exhausted his claims against LeBlanc. <em>See Johnson, </em>385 F.3d at 515.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-5\">The district court erred in granting Le-Blane\u2019s motion for summary judgment, and it abused its discretion in denying the motion to alter or amend the judgment. <em>See Dillon, </em>596 F.3d at 266; <em>Johnson v. Diversicare Afton Oaks, L.L.C., </em>597 F.3d 673, 677 (5th Cir.2010). The judgment is vacated in part and remanded for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-6\">AFFIRMED IN PART, VACATED IN PART AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b790-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
