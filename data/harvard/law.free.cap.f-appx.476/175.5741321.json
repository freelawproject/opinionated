MOTIONS TO RECUSE</p>\n<p id=\"b202-4\">We review a district court\u2019s denial of a motion for recusal for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Bailey, </em>175 F.3d 966, 968 (11th Cir.1999). Under the abuse of discretion standard, we will affirm the refusal to recuse unless we \u201cconclude that the impropriety is clear and one which would be recognized by all objective, reasonable persons.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b202-5\">A federal judge must disqualify herself if her \u201cimpartiality might reasonably be questioned,\u201d or where a judge \u201chas a personal bias or prejudice concerning a party,\u201d has participated as counsel in the matter, or has a financial interest in the matter. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 455(a), (b). Under \u00a7 455(a), challenges to a judge\u2019s \u201cordinary efforts at courtroom administration,\u201d including \u201cjudicial rulings, routine trial administration efforts, and ordinary admonishments (whether or not legally supportable) to counsel and to witnesses,\u201d are not sufficient to require a judge to recuse herself. <em>Liteky v. United States, </em>510 U.S. 540, 556, 114 S.Ct. 1147, 1157, 1158, 127 L.Ed.2d 474 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b202-10\">While we liberally construe the pleadings of <em>pro se </em>litigants, Lomax fails to present any argument relevant to the motions for recusal. Because she has presented no argument germane to these issues, Lomax has abandoned her appeal with respect to the denials of recusal. <em>Rowe v. Schreiber, </em>139 F.3d 1381, 1382 n. 1 (11th Cir.1998). Even if we consider the merits, we find that the district court did not abuse its discretion under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 455(a) or (b). There is no evidence that the district court judge\u2019s impartiality could be questioned, nor that she had any personal bias or financial interest in the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>II. MOTION FOR RECONSIDERATION</p>\n<p id=\"b203-5\">The denial of a motion for reconsideration is reviewed for abuse of discretion. <em>Big Top Koolers, Inc. v. Circus-Man Snacks, Inc., </em>528 F.3d 839, 842 (11th Cir.2008). To prevail on a motion for reconsideration, the moving party must present new facts or law of a strongly convincing nature. <em>Slomcenski v. Citibank, N.A., </em>432 F.3d 1271, 1276 n. 2 (11th Cir.2005). There is no abuse of discretion where the district court denies a motion for reconsideration that merely \u201craise[s] arguments which could, and should, have been made before the judgment is issued.\u201d <em>Lussier v. Dugger, </em>904 F.2d 661, 667 (11th Cir.1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b203-6\">Lomax has not met her burden. First, Lomax has not presented any facts at all in her brief. Second, none of the cases cited in her brief are new or strongly convincing. Accordingly, it was not error for the district court to deny Lomax\u2019s March 11, 2011, motion to the extent that it requested reconsideration of the district court\u2019s dismissal of the amended complaint. <em>Lussier, </em>904 F.2d at 667.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-7\">Finding no reversible error, we affirm the district court\u2019s denial of Lomax\u2019s motions to recuse and her motion for reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-8\">AFFIRMED.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b201-19\">. <em>Lorisme v. I.N.S., </em>129 F.3d 1441, 1444 n. 3 (11th Cir.1997).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b201-30\">. In order to determine exactly what issues are properly on appeal, we must examine the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>relevant procedural history. Lomax filed her amended complaint on November 22, 2010. The district court dismissed it on January 11, 2011, because it had \"no arguable basis in law or in fact.\u201d Lomax then filed a Motion for Judgment as a Matter of Law on February 3, 2011, and the district court (construing it as a motion for reconsideration) denied it on February 18, 2011. Lomax then filed a Motion to Recuse on March 8, 2011, and it was denied on March 14, 2011. Lomax filed a \"Motion Amend to Recuse\u201d on March 11, 2011. This \"Motion Amend to Recuse\u201d stated nothing about recu-sal but included a demand for a jury trial and a citation to an Eleventh Circuit case on the topic of immunity, which bore a relationship to the merits of Lomax\u2019s amended complaint. The district court summarily denied this motion on March 23, 2011. We construe Lo-max\u2019s \"Motion Amend to Recuse\u201d to include both (1) another motion for recusal and (2) another motion for reconsideration of the district court\u2019s dismissal of Lomax's amended complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"AZM\">Lomax's notice of appeal stated that she was appealing the district court\u2019s denial of her \"Motion Amend to Recuse.\u201d We construe that to also include the denial of her initial Motion to Recuse. <em>Ostemeck v. E.T. Barwick Indus., Inc., </em>825 F.2d 1521, 1528-29 (11th Cir.1987). Therefore, the proper issues on appeal are (1) the district court's March 14, 2011, denial of Lomax\u2019s initial Motion to Recuse; (2) the district court\u2019s March 23, 2011, denial of Lomax's motion to amend her motion for recusal; and (3) the district court\u2019s March 23, 2011, denial of Lomax's motion for another reconsideration of dismissal. <em>See id.] Lorisme, </em>129 F.3d at 1444 n. 3.</p>\n<p id=\"Ah_5\">The district court\u2019s actual dismissal of Lo-max's amended complaint is not properly on appeal since it was not included in Lomax\u2019s notice of appeal. <em>Ostemeck, </em>825 F.2d at 1528-29 (\"The general rule in this circuit is that an appellate court has jurisdiction to review only those judgments, orders or portions thereof which are specified in an appellant\u2019s notice of appeal. Although we generally construe a notice of appeal liberally, we will not expand it to include judgments and orders not specified unless the overriding intent to appeal these orders is readily apparent <em>on the face of the notice.\") </em>(emphasis added and citations omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b203-10\">. Lomax\u2019s motion for leave to file a reply brief out-of-time is GRANTED. Her request for oral argument is DENIED.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
