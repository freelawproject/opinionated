Marshall, federal prisoner # 12356-032, appeals the district court\u2019s dismissal of his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 petition <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>challenging his conviction for conspiracy to possess oxycodone with the intent to distribute. Marshall argues that the district court erred in dismissing his petition because (1) requiring him to file a \u00a7 2255 motion would improperly suspend his constitutional right to a writ of habeas corpus, (2) any remedy under \u00a7 2255 would be inadequate to test the legality of his detention because his motion would be barred by the statute of limitations, and (3) pursuant to \u00a7 2241(b), the district should have transferred his petition to a court with proper jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-4\">We review a district court\u2019s dismissal of a \u00a7 2241 petition de novo. <em>Kinder v. Pur-dy, </em>222 F.3d 209, 212 (5th Cir.2000). \u201cA section 2241 petition that seeks to challenge the validity of a federal sentence must either be dismissed or construed as a section 2255 motion.\u201d <em>Pack v. Yusuff, </em>218 F.3d 448, 452 (5th Cir.2000). A \u00a7 2241 petition that attacks custody resulting from a federally imposed sentence may be entertained under the savings clause of \u00a7 2255 if the petitioner establishes that the remedy provided under \u00a7 2255 is \u201cinadequate or ineffective\u201d to test the legality of his detention. <em>Tolliver v. Dobre, </em>211 F.3d 876, 878 (5th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b80-5\">Marshall\u2019s assertion that the dismissal of his \u00a7 2241 petition would result in a miscarriage of justice by suspending his constitutional right to seek a writ of habeas corpus is conclusional at best and is not sufficient to make the necessary affirmative showing for relief under the savings clause. <em>See Koch v. Puckett, </em>907 F.2d 524, 530 (5th Cir.1990) (stating that conclusional allegations fail to establish a valid claim). In any event, we have previously rejected a similar suspension clause argument. <em>See Wesson v. United States Penitentiary Beaumont, TX, </em>805 F.3d 343, 347 (5th Cir.2002) (concluding that \u00a7 2255\u2019s savings clause does not violate the Suspension Clause).</p>\n<p id=\"b80-7\">To demonstrate that the remedy provided under \u00a7 2255 is inadequate or ineffective, Marshall must establish that his claim is \u201c(i) ... based on a retroactively applicable Supreme Court decision which establishes that [he] ... may have been convicted of a nonexistent offense and (ii) that was foreclosed by circuit law at the time when the claim should have been raised in [his] ... trial, appeal, or first \u00a7 2255 motion.\u201d <em>Reyes-Requena v. United States, </em>243 F.3d 893, 904 (5th Cir.2001). Marshall\u2019s assertions that Kentucky is not a state and that his indictment was invalid do not meet this standard. <em>See Padilla v. United States, </em>416 F.3d 424, 427 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b80-8\">Equally unavailing is Marshall\u2019s assertion that the district court should have transferred his petition pursuant to \u00a7 2241(b). Section 2241(b) simply states that courts \u201cmay\u201d transfer a habeas application to a court of appropriate jurisdiction; however, there is no mandate that courts do so. Moreover, Marshall does not demonstrate that a transfer instead of a dismissal would have served the best interests of justice. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1631. Accordingly, the district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b79-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
