Reversible error has been shown; we affirm in part and vacate in part and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"811\">*811</page-number>De La Rosa received a total sentence of 48 months\u2019 imprisonment after pleading guilty to making a false statement on a passport application, illegal reentry into the United States, and aggravated identity theft. In his section 2255 motion De La Rosa raised seven claims \u2014 only three of which are at issue on appeal \u2014 including that his trial counsel was ineffective for (1) failing to recognize or make De La Rosa aware of the immigration consequences of his guilty plea and failing to negotiate effectively with the government to avoid automatic deportation; (2) failing to move for a downward departure based on De La Rosa\u2019s immigration status; and (8) failing to argue, based on <em>Flores-Figueroa v. United States, </em>556 U.S. 646, 129 S.Ct. 1886, 178 L.Ed.2d 853 (2009), that De La Rosa was not guilty of aggravated identity theft because he did not know that the identification he used belonged to another person.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-4\">The magistrate judge construed Claims 1 and 2 as a single claim \u2014 that De La Rosa\u2019s counsel was ineffective for failing to move for a downward departure to offset the additional time he would serve while the government processed his deportation order \u2014 and recommended denying it. Next, the magistrate construed Claim 3 as asserting both an ineffective assistance of counsel claim and an underlying claim that De La Rosa\u2019s conviction was invalid because the government failed to prove each element of the offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-5\">The magistrate recommended denying the ineffective assistance of counsel claim raised in Claim 3 but recommended granting De La Rosa\u2019s motion based on his underlying challenge to his aggravated identity theft conviction. In doing so, the magistrate concluded that <em>Flores-Figueroa </em>applied retroactively and that, although De La Rosa failed to raise this argument on direct appeal, he overcame procedural default because he was actually innocent of aggravated identity theft.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-9\">Although the district court adopted the magistrate\u2019s report and recommendation in part, it reversed the magistrate\u2019s recommendation on Claim 3. In doing so, the district court concluded that De La Rosa failed to overcome his procedural default because sufficient evidence existed for a reasonable juror to conclude that De La Rosa knew that the means of identification belonged to another person.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-10\">We granted a certificate of appealability (\u201cCOA\u201d) on these issues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b837-11\">(1) Whether the district court violated <em>Clisby v. Jones, </em>960 F.2d 925, 936 (llth Cir.1992) when it failed to address De La Rosa\u2019s argument in Claim 1, that his plea was invalid because counsel failed to make himself or De La Rosa aware of the immigration consequences of a guilty plea and failed to negotiate more favorable deportation terms with the government?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b837-12\">(2) As to Claim 3:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b837-13\">(a) whether the district court erred in construing this claim as raising an independent actual innocence claim or a claim that his plea did not qualify as intelligent following the narrowed definition of aggravated identity theft announced in <em>United States v. Flores-Figueroa </em>...,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b837-14\">(b) and, whether the district court erred in finding that De La Rosa failed to overcome procedural default to bring his claim pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b837-15\">On appeal, De La Rosa argues that the district court violated <em>Clisby </em>by failing to address the issues raised in Claim l.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"812\">*812</page-number>considering a district court\u2019s denial of a section 2255 motion, we review fact determinations for clear error and questions of law <em>de novo. Thomas v. United States, </em>572 F.3d 1300, 1303 (11th Cir.2009).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b838-4\">In <em>Clisby, </em>we wrote that district courts must \u201cresolve all constitutional claims presented in a petition for writ of habeas corpus pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 before granting or denying relief.\u201d 960 F.2d at 934; <em>see also Rhode v. United States, </em>583 F.3d 1289, 1291 (11th Cir.2009) (extending Clisby\u2019s requirement to resolve all claims for relief to section 2255 motions). A \u201cclaim for relief\u2019 is defined as \u201cany allegation of a constitutional violation\u201d; and allegations of distinct constitutional violations constitute separate claims for relief \u201ceven if both allegations arise from the same alleged set of operative facts.\u201d <em>Clisby, </em>960 F.2d at 936.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-5\">The district court failed to consider the arguments raised in Claim 1 of De La Rosa\u2019s section 2255 motion. Construed liberally, De La Rosa asserted in Claim 1 that his counsel was ineffective for (a) failing to recognize and to advise De La Rosa that he would be subject to additional imprisonment while awaiting deportation; (b) failing to recognize and to advise De La Rosa that he would be subject to automatic deportation if convicted of a crime for which the possible sentence exceeded one year; and (c) failing to negotiate a more favorable plea agreement. Because each of these arguments constitutes a separate constitutional claim under <em>Clisby </em>but was not addressed by the district court, we vacate the denial of the motion and remand the case with instructions for the district court to consider each distinct claim raised in Claim 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-8\">Next, we address the Claim 3 issues. De La Rosa argues \u2014 and the government concedes \u2014 that the district court properly construed Claim 3 as raising an independent actual innocence claim. We agree. De La Rosa argued plainly that he was not guilty of aggravated identity theft because he did not intend to steal another person\u2019s identity and did not know that the identification he used belonged to an actual person.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-9\">We also <em>agree, </em>however, with the district court\u2019s conclusion that De La Rosa failed to overcome his procedural default on that claim. \u2018Where a defendant has procedurally defaulted a claim by failing to raise it on direct review, the claim may be raised in [a section 2255 motion] only if the defendant can first demonstrate either \u2018cause\u2019 and actual \u2018prejudice,\u2019 or that he is \u2018actually innocent.\u2019\u201d <em>Bousley v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 614, 118 S.Ct. 1604, 1611, 140 L.Ed.2d 828 (1998) (citations omitted). In this case, De La Rosa argues only that he is actually innocent. To establish actual innocence, De La Rosa must demonstrate that, in the light of all the evidence, \u201cit is more likely than not that no reasonable juror would have convicted him.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Because \u201c \u2018actual innocence\u2019 means factual innocence, not mere legal insufficiency,\u201d the government may rely on admissible evidence of De La Rosa\u2019s guilt even if that evidence was not presented during the plea colloquy. <em>See id. </em>at 1611-12.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-10\">In <em>Flores-Figueroa </em>\u2014 decided after De La Rosa was sentenced \u2014 the United States Supreme Court concluded that to obtain a conviction for aggravated identity <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"813\">*813</page-number>theft, the government must prove \u201cthat the defendant knew that the means of identification at issue belonged to another person.\u201d 129 S.Ct. at 1894. And the government may rely on circumstantial evidence to establish that element of the offense. <em>United States v. Gomez-Castro, </em>605 F.3d 1245, 1249 (11th Cir.2010). \u201cBoth the circumstances in which an offender obtained a victim\u2019s identity and the offender\u2019s later misuse of that identity can shed light on the offender\u2019s knowledge about that identity.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1248. For example, in <em>Gomez-Castro, </em>we concluded that circumstantial evidence supported an aggravated identity theft conviction when the defendant paid a large sum of $2,500 for a birth certificate and social security card and then \u201crepeatedly and successfully tested the authenticity\u201d of those documents by using them to obtain a driver\u2019s license, two credit cards, a bank card, and a United States passport. <em>Id. </em>In a similar case, we determined that a reasonable juror could have found beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant knew that a social security card belonged to a real person when she used it to obtain a United States passport, a driver\u2019s license, and a line of credit. <em>United States v. Holmes, </em>595 F.3d 1255, 1258 (11th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b839-5\">After reviewing the record, we conclude that sufficient circumstantial evidence existed to prove that De La Rosa knew that the identification he used belonged to an actual person. He purchased a birth certificate and social security card in the name of A.S.B. for $1,500. He also successfully used those documents to obtain a Florida driver\u2019s license, to obtain a mortgage, and to open a checking account, all in A.S.B.\u2019s name. In the light of this evidence, it is unlikely that no reasonable juror would have convicted De La Rosa of aggravated identity theft as that offense is defined in Flores-Figueroa.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Thus, De La Rosa has failed to demonstrate that he is \u201cactually innocent\u201d of his offense such that he may overcome his procedural bar.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b839-8\">AFFIRMED IN PART; VACATED IN PART; AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b837-6\">. We will not consider De La Rosa\u2019s arguments about the merits of Claim 1 because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"812\">*812</page-number>these arguments are outside the scope of the COA. <em>See Murray v. United States, </em>145 F.3d 1249, 1251 (11th Cir.1998) (stating that, in a section 2255 proceeding, \"appellate review is limited to the issues specified in the COA\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b838-11\">.

In his appellate brief, De La Rosa argues that the district court erred in failing to rely on or address this Court\u2019s unpublished decision in <em>United States v.

Because the record affirmatively contradicts De La Rosa's allegations of actual innocence, the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying De La Rosa\u2019s section 2255 motion without an evidentiary hearing. <em>See Aron v.
