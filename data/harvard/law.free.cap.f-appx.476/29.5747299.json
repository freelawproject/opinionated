He was sentenced to a 32-year term of imprisonment. <em>State v. Lee, </em>844 So.2d 970, 974-75, 1000 (La.Ct.App.2003). Lee filed an application under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 in federal court, claiming, inter alia, that the prosecution violated his rights under the Fifth Amendment by commenting on his failure to testify during closing argument. The district court denied relief on the ground that it was clear from the record that the prosecution was not commenting on Lee\u2019s failure to testify, but was instead using the trial evidence to contradict Lee\u2019s taped statement that was played to the jury. The district court nevertheless granted a certificate of appealability on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-15\">A federal court may not grant habeas relief on any claim that was adjudicated on the merits in state court proceedings unless the state court\u2019s ruling was the result of \u201ca decision that was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States,\u201d or if the state court decision \u201cwas based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the State court proceeding.\u201d \u00a7 2254(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b56-16\">A prosecutor\u2019s comment on a defendant\u2019s failure to testify violates the Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination. <em>Griffin v. California, </em>380 U.S. 609, 613-15, 85 S.Ct. 1229, 14 L.Ed.2d 106 (1965); <em>United States v. Martinez-Larraga, </em>517 F.3d 258, 266 (5th Cir.2008). Remarks made by a prosecutor must be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>considered in context. <em>United States v. Delgado, </em>672 F.3d 320, 335 (5th Cir.2012) (en banc) (direct appeal). The Fifth Amendment is violated if the prosecutor\u2019s \u201cmanifest intent ... must have been to comment on the defendant\u2019s silence\u201d or if \u201cthe character of the remark [was] such that the jury would naturally and necessarily construe it as a comment on the defendant\u2019s silence.\u201d <em>Cotton v. Cockrell, </em>343 F.3d 746, 751 (5th Cir.2003). There is no manifest intent to comment on a defendant\u2019s failure to testify if there is another \u201cequally plausible\u201d explanation for a prosecutor\u2019s remarks. <em>United States v. Collins, </em>972 F.2d 1385, 1406 (5th Cir. 1992) (internal quotation and citation omitted). The relevant question with regard to the character of such a remark is not whether a jury \u201cpossibly or even probably\u201d would view it as a comment on the defendant\u2019s silence, but whether a jury would necessarily construe it as such. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b57-5\">When read in context of the record as a whole, it is clear that the prosecutor was contending that the trial evidence showed Lee\u2019s taped statement explaining that he and one of the victims had had consensual sex simply made no sense. The prosecutor\u2019s comments were consistent with the trial evidence. <em>See Delgado, </em>672 F.3d at 336. An attorney may argue to the jury the \u201cinferences and conclusions\u201d that it should draw from the evidence so long as counsel\u2019s assertions are based on the evidence. <em>Id. </em>The prosecutor\u2019s closing argument in this ease sounds as a comment on the defense\u2019s failure to undermine or rebut the State\u2019s evidence rather than a reference to Lee\u2019s silence. <em>See Montoya v. Collins, </em>955 F.2d 279, 287 (5th Cir.1992); <em>United States v. Guzman, </em>781 F.2d 428, 432 (5th Cir.1986). Lee has not shown that the district court erred in determining that the state court\u2019s adjudication of his claim was not unreasonable in light of the facts and clearly established federal law. <em>Charles v. Thaler, </em>629 F.3d 494, 498 (5th Cir.2011); <em>see </em>\u00a7 2254(d)(1), (2).</p>\n<p id=\"b57-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b56-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
