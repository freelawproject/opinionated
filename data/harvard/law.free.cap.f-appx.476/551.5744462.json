The district court dismissed his suit as frivolous under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B) and denied his request to proceed in forma pauperis (IFP) on appeal. This court is now presented with Haddix\u2019s IFP motion, and he has also filed his appellate brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-19\">By moving for IFP status in this court, Haddix challenges the district court\u2019s denial of his request for leave to proceed IFP on appeal, which was grounded in its determination that his appeal was not taken in good faith. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997). This court\u2019s inquiry into whether an appeal is taken in good faith \u201cis limited to whether the appeal involves legal points arguable on their merits (and therefore not frivolous).\u201d <em>Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b577-20\">Consistent with his filings in the district court, Haddix\u2019s brief to this court contains little law and many conclusional allegations. All of his contentions are centered on his thesis that his arrest, prosecution, and conviction are invalid. He insists that the initial traffic stop that led to officers\u2019 discovery of the weapon in his vehicle was flawed and that the subsequent criminal proceedings are the result of both deliberate and negligent misdeeds by various state actors. Under Haddix\u2019s view, he raised meritorious claims against the prosecutors, his appointed attorneys, the judge, police officers, lawmakers, and law enforcement personnel. These claims are not, he avers, barred by <em>Heck v. Humphrey, </em>512 U.S. 477, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994). Further, he asserts that his case was not amenable to preliminary screening, that certain parties conspired to wrong him, and that he is entitled to relief under <em>Brady v. Maryland, </em>373 U.S. 83, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215 (1963). Finally, he argues that the district court\u2019s conclusions concerning prosecutori<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>al, judicial, and sovereign immunity were incorrect.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-4\">Our review of Haddix\u2019s filings and pertinent authority shows that his appeal is without arguable merit and thus is not taken in good faith. Consequently, his IFP motion is DENIED, and this appeal is DISMISSED AS FRIVOLOUS. <em>See Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202 n. 24; <em>Howard, </em>707 F.2d at 219-20; 5th CiR. R. 42.2.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b577-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
