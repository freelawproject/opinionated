The search was conducted without a warrant, and Williams contends that none of the exceptions for warrantless searches applied.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-13\">We review a district court\u2019s denial of a motion to suppress under two standards. We examine the court\u2019s findings of fact for clear error, and its application of the law to those facts <em>de novo. United States v. Bervaldi, </em>226 F.3d 1256, 1262 (11th Cir.2000). The district court referred Williams\u2019s motion to suppress to a magistrate judge. He held an evidentiary hearing and recommended that the district court deny the motion. Williams objected to the recommendation, but only as to the magistrate judge\u2019s legal conclusions. The district court overruled his objections and denied his motion. Since Williams did not object to the magistrate judge\u2019s fact findings, our review is limited to the district court\u2019s application of Fourth Amendment law. We find no error in the application and therefore affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-14\">Here are the facts on which the district court based its ruling. On August 24, 2009, an undercover narcotics detective in the Jacksonville, Florida Sheriff\u2019s office bought heroin from Williams, which Williams obtained from his pick-up truck. The detective bought heroin from Williams again, three days later on August 27; this sale took place inside Williams\u2019s pick-up truck. On September 14, 2009, narcotics officers in the Sheriffs office, aware of the August 14 and 27 heroin sales, spotted Williams near his truck. He saw them approaching and attempted to get into his truck. But they seized him and placed him under arrest, in handcuffs. As they were doing so, one of the officers noticed a gun in the pocket of the door on the driver\u2019s side of the truck.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>The officers placed Williams in a police car, and then seized the truck, for they had reason to believe that it contained contraband and thus was subject to forfeiture. They drove the truck to the police station, where, pursuant to the Sheriffs office\u2019s standard procedures, they searched it. The search uncovered the suspected contraband: heroin and cocaine, located in the truck\u2019s ash tray, and the gun that had been seen in the pocket of the driver\u2019s-side door.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-5\">The district court\u2019s conclusion that the foregoing facts gave the officers probable cause to arrest Williams for the drug offenses for which he was convicted is unassailable. Also unassailable is the court\u2019s conclusion that, given the totality of the circumstances, the officers had probable cause to believe that the truck contained evidence of Williams\u2019s heroin trafficking. Accordingly, the automobile exception to the Fourth Amendment\u2019s warrant requirement authorized the war-rantless search. <em>See United States v. Tamari, </em>454 F.3d 1259, 1261 (11th Cir.2006). The exception applied even though the officers searched the truck after taking Williams into custody and securing the vehicle. <em>United States v. Birdsong, </em>982 F.2d 481, 483 (11th Cir.1993). The court concluded, alternatively, that the officers\u2019 inventory search was proper. We agree. <em>See South Dakota v. Opperman, </em>428 U.S. 364, 376, 96 S.Ct. 3092, 3100, 49 L.Ed.2d 1000 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b401-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b400-11\">.
