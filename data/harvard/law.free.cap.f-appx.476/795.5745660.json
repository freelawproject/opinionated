California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), and <em>United States v. Flores, </em>632 F.3d 229 (5th Cir.2011). Ortiz-Pena has filed a response and has moved to relieve appointed counsel and to appoint new counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-7\">To the extent that Ortiz-Pena raises claims of ineffective assistance of counsel, the record is insufficiently developed to allow consideration at this time of her claims; such claims generally \u201ccannot be resolved on direct appeal when the claim[s] ha[ve] not been raised before the district court since no opportunity existed to develop the record on the merits of the allegations.\u201d <em>United States v. Cantwell, </em>470 F.3d 1087, 1091 (5th Cir.2006) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). We have reviewed counsel\u2019s brief and the relevant portions of the record reflected therein, as well as Ortiz-Pena\u2019s response. We concur* with counsel\u2019s assessment that the appeal presents no nonfrivolous issue for appellate review. Ortiz-Pena\u2019s motion to relieve counsel and appoint new counsel is DENIED. The FPD\u2019s motion for leave to withdraw is GRANTED, counsel is excused from further responsibilities herein, and the APPEAL IS DISMISSED. <em>See </em>5th Cm. R. 42.2.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b822-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
