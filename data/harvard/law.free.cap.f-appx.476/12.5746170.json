He argues that the district court erred in denying his motion to suppress, contending that the officer\u2019s actions were not reasonably related to the circumstances that justified the traffic stop because there was no reasonable suspicion that Fields, the passenger in the vehicle, was engaged in criminal activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-17\">On appeal from the denial of a motion to suppress evidence, we review the district court\u2019s factual findings for clear error and its conclusions of law de novo. <em>United States v. Pack, </em>612 F.3d 341, 347 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 620, 178 L.Ed.2d 450 (2010). Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the Government, the officer\u2019s discovery of marijuana residue, partnered with the driver\u2019s admission to the presence of additional contraband, rendered the weapons patdown and handcuffing of Fields reasonable. <em>See United States v. Scroggins, </em>599 F.3d 433, 443 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 131 S.Ct. 158, 178 L.Ed.2d 95 (2010); <em>United States v. Majors, </em>328 F.3d 791, 795 (5th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b39-22\">Fields\u2019s continued detention was not violative of the Fourth Amendment because while investigating the basis of the initial traffic stop, the officer\u2019s discovery of marijuana residue created reasonable suspicion of additional criminal activity that rendered Fields\u2019s further detention permissible for a reasonable time while the officer attempted to dispel this reasonable suspicion. <em>See Pack, </em>612 F.3d at 350, 352. The officer\u2019s inquiry of Fields into matters <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>unrelated to the justification for the traffic stop, i.e., whether he was in possession of contraband, did not convert the encounter into something other than a lawful seizure because that inquiry did not measurably extend the duration of the stop. <em>See Arizona v. Johnson, </em>555 U.S. 328, 333, 129 S.Ct. 781, 172 L.Ed.2d 694 (2009). In light of the preceding, the district court\u2019s ruling on the motion to suppress was not in error.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-4\">Fields\u2019s argument that the Fair Sentencing Act (FSA) should be retroactively applied is foreclosed by <em>United States v. Tickles, </em>661 F.3d 212, 215 (5th Cir.), <em>petition for cert. filed </em>(Dec. 15, 2011) (No. 11-8023) <em>and </em>(Dec. 27, 2011) (No. 11-8268), which held \u201cthat the penalties prescribed by the FSA do not apply to federal criminal sentencing for illegal conduct that preceded the FSA\u2019s enactment.\u201d We remain bound by <em>Tickles </em>absent an intervening Supreme Court case overruling this precedent. <em>See United States v. Lopez-Velasquez, </em>526 F.3d 804, 808 n. 1 (5th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b40-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b39-14\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
