She argues that the district court erred when it dismissed her third amended complaint because (1) the factual allegations contained therein were sufficient to state a claim for relief and (2) the complaint complied with the applicable Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-22\">We review for an abuse of discretion the district court\u2019s decision to dismiss a complaint for failure to comply with a court order or court rules. <em>Goforth v. Owens, </em>766 F.2d 1533, 1535 (11th Cir.1985). Discretion means that the district court may act within a \u201crange of choice,\u201d and we will not disturb its decision \u201cas long as it stays within that range and is not influenced by any mistake of law.\u201d <em>Betty K Agencies, Ltd. v. M/V Monada, </em>432 F.3d 1333, 1337 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b882-23\">A district court may dismiss a case under its inherent authority to manage its docket. <em>Id. </em>\u201c[Dismissal upon disregard of an order, especially where the litigant has been forewarned, generally is not an abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Moon v. Newsome, </em>863 F.2d 835, 837 (11th Cir.1989) (citations omitted). When a complaint is dismissed without prejudice and the plaintiff elects to pursue an appeal rather than amend the complaint, \u201cthe order to dismiss without <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"857\">*857</page-number>prejudice is considered an adjudication on the merits\u201d over which we have jurisdiction. <em>Jackson v. Okaloosa Cnty., </em>21 F.8d 1531, 1536 n. 4 (11th Cir.1994). Although <em>pro se </em>pleadings are to be construed liberally, \u201cprocedural rules in ordinary civil litigation\u201d should not be interpreted \u201cso as to excuse mistakes by those who proceed without counsel.\u201d <em>McNeil v. United States, </em>508 U.S. 106, 113, 113 S.Ct. 1980, 1984, 124 L.Ed.2d 21 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b883-5\">Here, the district court provided Bell with instructions in its order dismissing her second amended complaint. Bell\u2019s third amended complaint failed to comply with these detailed instructions regarding how to plead claims and which claims to present. Bell (1) failed to abide by the district court\u2019s specific instructions to comply with Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 10, (2) included causes of action that she had previously disclaimed, and (3) added new claims that had not been asserted in any of the prior pleadings.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-6\"><em>Pro se </em>status cannot excuse noncompliance with the district court\u2019s precise orders or the federal rules governing how to file a properly pleaded complaint. <em>See McNeil, </em>508 U.S. at 113, 113 S.Ct. at 1984. Accordingly, the district court did not abuse its discretion by dismissing Bell\u2019s third amended complaint.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b883-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b883-9\"> To the extent that Bell raises a separate argument on appeal regarding the classification of her case under the district court\u2019s local rules for discovery management, this argument cannot succeed because her case never reached the discovery phase in the district court.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
