On appeal, he argues that the district court erroneously denied him: (1) safety-valve relief under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5C1.2 and (2) a one-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3El.l(b). For the reasons set forth below, we affirm Charles\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-11\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-12\">Charles was arrested after Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers found 1,385 grams of a mixture containing cocaine in Charles\u2019s duffel bag at the Atlanta airport. After being arrested, Charles stated that an individual named Brian approached him and offered him money and a free trip to Miami. Charles agreed to fly from St. Croix, Virgin Islands to Miami, via Atlanta, to deliver something to an unnamed individual. Charles stated that he did not know how he would be paid for the trip, nor did he know how the cocaine ended up in his bag. He believed that an airport worker put the cocaine in his bag.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-14\">After being indicted for possessing with intent to distribute at least 500 grams of a mixture and substance containing a detectable amount of cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1), (b)(l)(B)(ii), Charles ultimately pleaded guilty. In preparing the presentence investigation report (\u201cPSI\u201d), the probation officer calculated a base offense level of 26, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c)(7). Charles did not receive a two-level reduction under the safety-valve provision of \u00a7 5C1.2 because: (1) he had not been debriefed, and (2) the government did not believe that it had learned all information regarding the offense. Charles received a two-level reduction under \u00a7 3El.l(a) for acceptance of responsibility, but the government did not wish to make a motion for an additional one-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility. Based on a total offense level of 24 and a criminal history category of I, Charles\u2019s guideline range was 51 to 63 months\u2019 imprisonment. Charles\u2019s offense carried a five-year mandatory minimum sentence, from which Charles would have been exempt if he met the \u00a7 5C1.2 criteria. Neither Charles nor the government objected to the PSI.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-15\">At sentencing, Charles, through counsel, confirmed that there were no objections to the PSI, and the court adopted the facts in the PSI. The court further adopted the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>PSI\u2019s guideline calculations and guideline range of 51 to 63 months\u2019 imprisonment and stated that Charles was subject to a five-year statutory mandatory minimum sentence. The court noted that, as stated in the PSI, Charles was not eligible for relief under \u00a7 5C1.2, also known as \u201csafety-valve\u201d relief. Charles stated that he had no objections to the guideline calculations. The court sentenced Charles to 60 months\u2019 imprisonment and 3 years\u2019 supervised release. The court asked if there were objections to the court\u2019s findings, guideline calculations, the sentence, or the manner in which the sentence was pronounced. Charles responded that he had no objections.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-6\">In reviewing a district court\u2019s decision regarding the applicability of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5C1.2, we review factual findings for clear error and issues of law <em>de novo. United States v. Milkintas, </em>470 F.3d 1339, 1343 (11th Cir.2006). Sentencing issues not raised before the district court, however, are reviewed for plain error. <em>United States v. Bennett, </em>472 F.3d 825, 831 (11th Cir.2006). Plain error exists where: (1) there was error; (2) the error was plain; (3) the error affected the defendant\u2019s substantial rights; and (4) \u201cthe error seriously affect[ed] the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 831-32. A defendant is deemed to have admitted facts contained in his PSI to which he has not objected. <em>Id. </em>at 832-34. The district court may base its factual findings at sentencing on admitted statements in the PSI. <em>Id. </em>at 832.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-7\">Under \u00a7 5C1.2, a defendant convicted of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841 is sentenced in accordance with his applicable guideline range, without regard to the statutory minimum sentence, if five conditions are met. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5C1.2(a). The fifth condition requires the defendant to have \u201ctruthfully provided to the [government all information and evidence the defendant has concerning the offense\u201d by the sentencing hearing. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 501.2(a)(5). The defendant bears the burden of proving that he is eligible for safety-valve relief. <em>Milkintas, </em>470 F.3d at 1345. The defendant bears the burden of providing true and full information about his offense, and the government is not required to solicit information from a defendant. <em>Id. </em>at 1345-46.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-9\">The district court did not err, plainly or otherwise, in denying Charles safety-valve relief under \u00a7 5C1.2. By failing to object to the PSI, Charles admitted all facts contained within the report, including that he had not been debriefed and that the government did not believe it had obtained all information regarding his offense. <em>See Bennett, </em>472 F.3d at 832-34. Under these facts, adopted by the court, Charles was not debriefed and thus did not meet his burden to show that he provided true and full information regarding his offense. <em>See Milkintas, </em>470 F.3d at 1345. Therefore, Charles did not show that he was eligible for safety-valve relief, and the court did not err in denying such relief. <em>See id.; </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5C1.2(a)(5). Finally, although Charles takes issue on appeal with the sufficiency of the court\u2019s factual findings, the court was not required to investigate the accuracy of the facts that Charles admitted. <em>See Bennett, </em>472 F.3d at 832.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-10\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-11\">When we determine that a district court has committed a sentencing error, \u201ca remand is appropriate unless [we] eon-clude[ ], on the record as a whole, that the error was harmless.\u201d <em>United States v. Kendrick, </em>22 F.3d 1066, 1068 (11th Cir.1994) (quotation omitted). An error is harmless if it \u201cdid not affect the district <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>court\u2019s selection of the sentence imposed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted). A defendant is subject to a five-year statutory mandatory minimum sentence for violating 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(l)(B)(ii). 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(l)(B)(ii). \u201cIt is well-settled that a district court is not authorized to sentence a defendant below the statutory mandatory minimum unless the government filed a substantial assistance motion ... or the defendant\u201d is eligible for safety-valve relief. <em>United States v. Castaing-Sosa, </em>530 F.3d 1358, 1360 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b242-5\">We do not consider whether the district court erroneously denied Charles an additional one-level reduction under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3El.l(b) because, even if the court erred, any error was harmless. <em>See Kendrielc, </em>22 F.3d at 1068. The district court sentenced Charles to 60 months\u2019 (5 years\u2019) imprisonment, which was also the statutory mandatory minimum sentence. <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(l)(B)(ii). Charles was not eligible to be sentenced below this mandatory minimum sentence because, as discussed above, he was not eligible for safety-valve relief. <em>See Castaing-Sosa, </em>530 F.3d at 1360. Therefore, even if the court\u2019s guideline calculation was incorrect, the court could not have imposed a lower sentence and any error was harmless. <em>See Kendrick, </em>22 F.3d at 1068.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-6\">For the <em>foregoing </em>reasons, we affirm Charles\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
