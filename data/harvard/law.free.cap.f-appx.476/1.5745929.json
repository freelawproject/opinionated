Williams\u2019 appeal failed. After the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"2\">*2</page-number>district court denied Williams\u2019 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion, a judge of this court granted a certificate of appealability (COA) on the following issues: (1) \u201cWhether Williams\u2019 appellate counsel\u2019s refusal to raise the issue that the district court violated Williams\u2019 Confrontation Clause and due process rights by curtailing cross-examination of Officer Woodard constitutes \u2018cause and prejudice\u2019 for the procedural default of this claim\u201d; and (2) \u201c[wjhether Williams stated a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel based on his trial counsel\u2019s failure to object to the district court\u2019s reliance on Williams\u2019 juvenile arrests that did not result in convictions when deciding to depart upward under [Sentencing Guideline] \u00a7 4A1.3\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-4\">The record, considered in the light of the parties\u2019 appellate briefs, shows no error in the district court\u2019s denial of habeas relief. Its legal conclusions are reviewed <em>de novo; </em>its factual findings, for clear error. <em>E.g., Chester v. Thaler, </em>666 F.3d 340, 356 (5th Cir.2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b28-5\">As to the first certified issue, the district court denied Williams\u2019 Confrontation Clause and due-process claims as procedurally barred because he had not raised them at trial or on direct appeal. A defendant \u201cmay not raise an issue for the first time on collateral review without showing both cause for his procedural default, and actual prejudice resulting from the error\u201d. <em>United States v. Shaid, </em>937 F.2d 228, 232 (5th Cir.1991) (en banc) (internal quotation marks omitted). As Williams urges here, the first issue for which the COA was granted is, \u201cin essence\u201d, a claim for ineffective assistance of counsel (IAC). \u201c[IAC] claims are obviously of constitutional magnitude and satisfy the cause and actual prejudice standard\u201d. <em>United States v. Pierce, </em>959 F.2d 1297, 1301 (5th Cir.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b28-8\">To show IAC, Williams must show both deficient performance and resulting prejudice. <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 691-92, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). Obviously, not raising every non-frivolous issue does not constitute deficient performance. <em>E.g., United States v. Rein-hart, </em>357 F.3d 521, 525 (5th Cir.2004). Williams has not shown his appellate counsel\u2019s performance was deficient because he has not demonstrated the issue he sought to pursue was clearly stronger than the issue counsel pursued on direct appeal. <em>Smith v. Robbins, </em>528 U.S. 259, 288, 120 S.Ct. 746, 145 L.Ed.2d 756 (2000) (citing <em>Jones v. Barnes, </em>463 U.S. 745, 103 S.Ct. 3308, 77 L.Ed.2d 987 (1983)). Therefore, we need not reach the IAC prejudice prong.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-9\">As for the second certified issue, Williams maintains counsel was ineffective by failing to object to the sentencing court\u2019s consideration of his unadjudicated juvenile conduct because Guideline \u00a7 4A1.3(a)(3) provides that a \u201cprior arrest record itself shall not be considered for purposes of an upward departure\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-12\">Although a district court may not consider a defendant\u2019s bare arrest record at sentencing, it may consider arrests \u201cif sufficient evidence corroborates their reliability\u201d. <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>648 F.3d 273, 277 (5th Cir.2011). The pre-sentence investigation report (PSR) contained more than Williams\u2019 arrest record. The Addendum to the PSR contained factual underpinnings for the juvenile arrests. The district court relied on those facts when making the upward departure, finding them sufficient to establish, by a preponderance of the evidence, that Williams had committed the juvenile offenses in question, even though they did not result in convictions. Williams presented no evidence that those facts were untrue or unfounded, nor did he articulate a plausible <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"3\">*3</page-number>explanation for the arrests other than his guilt. <em>Id. </em>at 278. The district court did not improperly rely merely on a history of juvenile arrests in deciding to depart upwardly. Consequently, counsel was not deficient for not objecting on that basis. <em>Smith v. Puckett, </em>907 F.2d 581, 585 n. 6 (5th Cir.1990) (\u201cCounsel is not deficient for ... failure to raise a legally meritless claim.\u201d). Again, we need not reach the prejudice prong.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b27-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
