After Robertson and the Government consented to proceeding before the magistrate judge pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(c), the magistrate judge determined that Robertson failed to exhaust administrative remedies and to allege a constitutional violation. The magistrate judge dismissed her suit as frivolous.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-16\">Robertson\u2019s brief describes the alleged harassment, notes that the district court did not call certain witnesses to testify, and asserts that she did not receive the defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss and was not instructed to answer it. She does not discuss whether she exhausted her claims or whether the defendants\u2019 actions amounted to a constitutional violation. She also fails to cite to the district court record.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-17\">The appellant\u2019s brief must contain her \u201ccontentions and the reasons for them, with citations to the authorities and parts of the record on which [she] relies.\u201d Fed. R.App. P. 28(a)(9)(A). Although we liberally construe pro se briefs, arguments must be briefed sufficiently to be preserved. <em>Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 224-25 (5th Cir.1993). Robertson\u2019s failure to address the magistrate judge\u2019s grounds for dismissing her claims, \u201cwithout even the slightest identification of any error in [the district court\u2019s] legal analysis or its application to [her] suit ..., is the same as if [s]he had not appealed that judgment.\u201d <em>Brinkmann v. Dallas County Deputy Sheriff Abner, </em>813 F.2d 744, 748 (5th Cir.1987). Accordingly, the appeal is DIS<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>MISSED AS FRIVOLOUS. <em>See id.; </em>5th Cm. R. 42.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-4\">Both the dismissal of Robertson\u2019s suit in the district court and the dismissal of this appeal count as strikes for purposes of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Ham-mons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 387 (5th Cir.1996). Robertson is WARNED that, once she accumulates three strikes, she may not proceed in forma pauperis in any civil action or appeal filed while she is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless she is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b325-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
