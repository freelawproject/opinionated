The district court sentenced Scott to concurrent 180-month sentences for each count, which was within the lower half of the guidelines range of 168 to 210 months. On appeal, Scott challenges the substantive reasonableness of his sentence on the ground that U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2G2.2, the guideline under which his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"846\">*846</page-number>sentence was calculated, is fundamentally incompatible with the individualized sentencing required under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b872-4\">We review the substantive reasonableness of a sentence for abuse of discretion. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). \u201cThe review for substantive unreasonableness involves examining the totality of the circumstances, including an inquiry into whether the statutory factors in \u00a7 3553(a) support the sentence in question.\u201d <em>United States v. Gonzalez, </em>550 F.3d 1319, 1324 (11th Cir.2008) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b872-5\">We have previously rejected the argument that U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2G2.2 is inherently flawed. <em>United States v. Wayererski, </em>624 F.3d 1342, 1354-55 (11th Cir.2010); <em>United States v. Pugh, </em>515 F.3d 1179, 1201 n. 15 (11th Cir.2008). Scott\u2019s reliance on a Second Circuit case criticizing \u00a7 2G2.2, <em>United States v. Dorvee, </em>616 F.3d 174 (2d Cir. 2010), is therefore misplaced, as the prior precedent of this circuit binds the panel until \u201coverruled by th[is] Court sitting en banc or by the Supreme Court,\u201d <em>United States v. Kaley, </em>579 F.3d 1246, 1255 (11th Cir.2009). Scott does not cite to, nor does he attempt to differentiate his case from, any of our precedent related to \u00a7 2G2.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-6\">Scott has not argued that any circumstances apart from the flawed nature of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2G2.2 render his sentence unreasonable. Upon our review, the record reflects that the district court considered the sentencing factors under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) and applied them reasonably. The district court, therefore, acted within its discretion and imposed a substantively reasonable sentence on the lower end of the guidelines range.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
