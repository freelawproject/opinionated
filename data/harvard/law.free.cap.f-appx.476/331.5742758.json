Garcia challenges the substantive reasonableness of his sentence, claiming that illegal reentry guidelines lack an empirical basis and that sentences based on those guidelines should not be afforded a presumption of reasonableness. He also contends that the conviction used to enhance his sentence was more than ten years old and that he would not have received as great an increase in offense level based on the 2011 amendments to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A). Garcia asserts that the sentence imposed by the district court did not accurately reflect his personal history and characteristics, including the facts that (1) he had been living in the United States since 1992, (2) he has two minor children who are United States citizens, (3) the woman with whom he has a relationship has been diagnosed with cancer, and (4) his motive for returning to the United States, which was based on his ties to the country, mitigates the seriousness of his offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-14\">Garcia concedes that plain error review applies because he did not challenge the reasonableness of his sentence before the district court. <em>See United States v. Peltier, </em>505 F.3d 389, 391-92 (5th Cir.2007). He raises this issue only to preserve it for possible review by the Supreme Court. He also seeks to preserve for review his contention that the appellate presumption of reasonableness should not apply to sentences imposed under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2 because that provision lacks an empirical basis. We have previously rejected this contention. <em>See United States v. Duarte, </em>569 F.3d 528, 529-31 (5th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b358-15\">The district court did not err in imposing a sentence based on the guidelines in effect at the time of Garcia\u2019s sentencing. <em>See United States v. Rodarte-Vasquez, </em>488 F.3d 316, 322 (5th Cir.2007). With respect to the age of the prior conviction that was used to enhance Garcia\u2019s offense level, \u201cthe staleness of a prior conviction used in the proper calculation of a guidelines-range sentence does not render a sentence substantively unreasonable\u201d and does not \u201cdestroy the presumption of reasonableness that attaches to such sentences.\u201d <em>United States v. Rodriguez, </em>660 F.3d 231, 234 (5th Cir.2011). Neither does Garcia\u2019s contention regarding his cultural <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>ties and his benign motive for reentry rebut that presumption. <em>See United States v. Gomez-Herrera, </em>523 F.3d 554, 565-66 (5th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">The record establishes that the district court listened to and rejected Garcia\u2019s arguments for a lower sentence and that the court considered the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors, including Garcia\u2019s personal history and characteristics, prior to imposing a sentence within the Guidelines. Garcia neither has rebutted the presumption of reasonableness of his within-guidelines sentence nor shown that the district court plainly erred by imposing a 54-month sentence. <em>See Puckett v. United States, </em>556 U.S. 129, 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b359-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b358-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
