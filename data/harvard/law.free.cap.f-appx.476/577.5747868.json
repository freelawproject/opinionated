Concurrently, he is serving a 120-month sentence for his conviction of being a felon in possession of a firearm. Whitehead appeals the district court\u2019s denial of his 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion for a reduction of his life sentence based on the retroactive amendments to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1, the guideline for crack cocaine offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>Section 3582(c)(2) permits the discretionary modification of a defendant\u2019s sentence \u201cin the case of a defendant who has been sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 994(o).\u201d \u00a7 3582(c)(2); <em>see United States v. Doublin, </em>572 F.3d 235, 237 (5th Cir.2009). The district court\u2019s decision whether to reduce a sentence under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) is reviewed for an abuse of discretion, while the court\u2019s interpretation of the Guidelines is reviewed de novo. <em>United States v. Evans, </em>587 F.3d 667, 672 (5th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b604-4\">Much of Whitehead\u2019s brief amounts to an attack on his original sentence. He asserts that he was entrapped into a higher sentence, and he contends that the procedures required under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 851 to increase his punishment by reason of his prior convictions were not followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-5\">\u201cA modification proceeding is not the forum for a collateral attack on a sentence long since imposed and affirmed on direct appeal.\u201d <em>United States v. Hernandez, </em>645 F.3d 709, 712 (5th Cir.2011). A \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion \u201cis not a second opportunity to present mitigating factors to the sentencing judge, nor is it a challenge to the appropriateness of the original sentence.\u201d <em>United States v. Whitebird, </em>55 F.3d 1007, 1011 (5th Cir.1995). Accordingly, to the extent that Whitehead challenges his original sentence, he cannot obtain relief under \u00a7 3582(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b604-7\">As the district court determined, on account of his prior felony drug convictions, Whitehead was subject to a mandatory sentence of life imprisonment under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A). A mandatory minimum statutory penalty overrides the retroactive application of a new guideline. <em>See United States v. Pardue, </em>36 F.3d 429, 431 (5th Cir.1994). Because Whitehead\u2019s sentence of life imprisonment was statutorily mandated, he was not \u201csentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d \u00a7 3582(c)(2); <em>see Pardue, </em>36 F.3d at 431.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b603-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
