Butler\u2019s complaint alleged that Betty Williams, the medical director of his prison unit, violated his constitutional rights through deliberate indifference to his serious medical need for shade lenses for his eyes.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-5\">A prisoner may not proceed IFP in a civil action or in an appeal of a judgment in a civil action if the prisoner has, on three or more prior occasions, while incarcerated, brought an action or appeal that was dismissed as frivolous, malicious, or for failure to state a claim, unless the prisoner is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. \u00a7 1915(g). Butler does not dispute that he has accumulated three strikes under \u00a7 1915(g) but challenges the application of \u00a7 1915(g) on the ground that it is impermissibly retroactive, restricts an indigent party\u2019s right of access to the courts, and violates his equal protection rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-6\">These arguments are unavailing. Butler\u2019s earliest strike was based on a May 31, 1996 district court decision, and we have held that \u00a7 1915(g) applies to cases that were pending on April 26, 1996, the date \u00a7 1915(g) became effective. <em>Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 385-87 (5th Cir.1996). We have also rejected the argument that the operation of the three-strikes bar of \u00a7 1915(g) violates a prisoner\u2019s right of access to the courts or equal protection rights. <em>Carson v. Johnson, </em>112 F.3d 818, 821-22 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b327-7\">Butler also contends that he meets the exception under \u00a7 1915(g) because he is in imminent danger of serious physical injury. Butler has received medical care regarding his vision, and there is no evidence of any medical recommendation for a shade pass for Butler at the time of this appeal. Accordingly, he has not made the requisite showing of imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See Ba\u00f1os v. O\u2019Guin, </em>144 F.3d 883, 884 (5th Cir.1998). Butler has also failed to show that his case presents exceptional circumstances warranting the appointment of counsel. <em>See Cooper v. Sheriff, Lubbock Cnty., Tex., </em>929 F.2d 1078, 1084 (5th Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b327-10\">Accordingly, IT IS ORDERED that Butler\u2019s motions for leave to proceed IFP and appointment of counsel are DENIED, and the appeal is DISMISSED. The appeal may be reinstated if Butler pays the appeal fees within 30 days of this dismissal.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b326-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
