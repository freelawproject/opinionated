No reversible error has been shown; we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-10\">Brown was convicted of child molestation in Georgia in 1996. Although Brown registered properly as a sex offender following his release from prison, he later stopped complying with the registration requirements. As a result, Brown was convicted in Georgia and was sentenced to three years\u2019 probation for failure to register as a sex offender. A few years later\u2014 because of Brown\u2019s continuing failure to comply with the sex offender registration requirements \u2014 Brown was arrested in connection with this case. In addition to the federal conviction at issue on appeal, Brown was also convicted by both Alabama and Georgia for failure to register as a sex offender. Brown was sentenced to 10 years\u2019 imprisonment for his Alabama conviction and to a concurrent term of 12 years\u2019 imprisonment for his Georgia conviction. On Brown\u2019s federal conviction, the district court imposed a 27-month sentence to run consecutive to Brown\u2019s existing state sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-13\">On appeal, Brown argues that the district court erred under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5G1.3(b) in imposing his federal sentence consecutive to his undischarged state sentences when all three convictions arose from the same underlying conduct. Because Brown failed to raise this objection in the district court, we review only for plain error.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>See United States v. Massey, </em>443 F.3d 814, 819 (11th Cir.2006) (stating that when a defendant\u2019s objection \u201cis not clear enough to inform the district court of the legal basis for the objection, ... the objection is not properly preserved.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b232-14\">Under section 5G1.3(b), when a defendant has an undischarged sentence for an \u201coffense that is relevant to the instant offense and <em>resulted in an increase in the offense level of the instant offense, </em>the district court should ... order that the instant sentence run concurrently with the sentence for the prior offense.\u201d <em>United States v. Knight, </em>562 F.3d 1314, 1329 (11th <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>Cir.2009) (emphasis added) (citing section 5G1.3(b)). Because Brown\u2019s state convictions were not used to increase his offense level in this case, section 5B 1.8(b) did not apply.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Thus, the district court had discretion to impose Brown\u2019s sentence \u201cto run concurrently, partially concurrently, or consecutively to the prior undischarged term of imprisonment to achieve a reasonable punishment for the instant offense.\u201d <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5G1.3(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b233-5\">Brown also argues that his sentence procedurally is unreasonable because the district court failed to explain its reasons for imposing a consecutive sentence and failed to indicate that it had considered the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors in imposing a consecutive sentence.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We review \u201call sentences ... for reasonableness under an abuse of discretion standard.\u201d <em>United States v. Irey, </em>612 F.3d 1160, 1186 (11th Cir.2010) <em>(en </em>banc). Although plain error applies where \u2014 as in this case \u2014 the defendant failed to raise an issue below, <em>see United States v. Rodriguez, </em>398 F.3d 1291, 1298 (11th Cir.2005), we have not applied plain error to an inquiry about the reasonableness of a sentence. And it is unnecessary to decide whether plain error applies in this case because Brown\u2019s arguments fail under either standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-6\">A sentence might be procedurally unreasonable if the district court fails to consider the factors set forth in section 3553(a) or fails to explain adequately the chosen sentence.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>United States v. Gonzalez, </em>550 F.3d 1319, 1323 (11th Cir.2008). In explaining a sentence, \u201c[t]he sentencing judge should set forth enough to satisfy the appellate court that he has considered the parties\u2019 arguments and has a reasoned basis for exercising his own legal decision-making authority.\u201d <em>Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2468, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b233-11\">That the district court considered the section 3553(a) factors in imposing Brown\u2019s consecutive sentence is clear. At the sentencing hearing, the court stated that the sentence imposed was reasonable in the light of the section 3553(a) factors and identified specifically those factors set forth in subsections (a)(1) and (a)(2)(A), (B), and (C). Because the court addressed the section 3553(a) factors immediately after announcing that Brown\u2019s sentence would run consecutive to his state sentences, we reject Brown\u2019s argument that the court considered the section 3553(a) factors only in determining the length of his sentence, but not in determining that his sentence would run consecutively.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-12\">We are also satisfied that the district court considered the parties\u2019 arguments and had a reasoned basis for imposing a consecutive sentence. <em>See Rita, </em>127 S.Ct. at 2468. In considering Brown\u2019s request for a concurrent sentence, the court inquired about the length of Brown\u2019s state sentences and considered both parties\u2019 arguments on the amount of time that Brown would likely serve under each of those sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>Brown also argues that his sentence substantively is unreasonable because his consecutive state and federal sentences effectively exceeded both the statutory maximum sentence and the sentencing guideline range for his federal offense. But statutory maximum sentences and sentencing guideline ranges apply only to the instant offense, not to an aggregate sentence resulting from consecutive sentences. Thus, contrary to Brown\u2019s argument, his 27-month sentence for the instant offense is both well-below the 10-year statutory maximum sentence for his offense and at the low end of the 27 to 33-month advisory guideline range.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> It is also well-established that federal courts can impose a federal sentence to run consecutive to a defendant\u2019s state sentence. <em>See United States v. Ballard, </em>6 F.3d 1502, 1506 (11th Cir.1993). And when multiple sentences are imposed at different times, a statutory presumption exists that the sentences will run consecutively. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3584; <em>Ballard, </em>6 F.3d at 1506. Thus, Brown has failed to demonstrate that his consecutive sentence is unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b232-11\">. Brown failed to object to the statement in the Presentence Investigation Report (\"PSI\u201d) that, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5G 1.3(c), Brown\u2019s sentence could \u2019\u2019be imposed to run concurrently, partially concurrently, or consecutively\u201d to his existing undischarged state sentences. And although Brown requested that the district court impose his sentence concurrent to his existing sentences, he presented no argument in support of his request and failed to object to the district court\u2019s final sentence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b233-7\">. Although Brown received three criminal history points as a result of his Georgia conviction, his offense level was not increased.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b233-8\">. Brown does not challenge the procedural or substantive reasonableness of the length of his 27-month sentence. Instead, his argument on appeal is limited to the reasonableness of the consecutive nature of his sentence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b233-9\">. Under section 3553(a), a district court must consider the nature and circumstances of the offense, the history and characteristics of the defendant, the need for the sentence to provide adequate deterrence, respect for the law, and protection of the public, the defendant\u2019s medical and educational needs, the advisory guideline range, the Sentencing Commission's policy statements, and the need to avoid unwarranted sentencing disparities and provide restitution. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(l)-(7).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b234-6\">. We note that \u2014 due to a typographical error in the PSI \u2014 the district court determined that Brown\u2019s total offense level was 12 instead of 13. As a result of this error, the court calculated Brown's guideline range as 27 to 33 months' imprisonment instead of 30 to 37 months' imprisonment. Because neither party raises this issue on appeal, we need not address it.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
