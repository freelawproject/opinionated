(\u201cCone\u201d) a Workers Compensation and Employers Liability' Insurance Policy (the \u201cPolicy\u201d). The Policy contained a high deductible endorsement. Under the endorsement, Cone remained financially responsible for individual claims below the Policy\u2019s $250,000 deductible. When Wausau paid claims below the deductible, Cone would reimburse Wausau for amounts paid on these claims. Under the Policy, Wausau received a fee for handling these claims. The amount of the fee varied depending upon the aggregate amount of the claims. According to the complaint, Wausau received a higher fee by approving greater payments to claimants rather than closely scrutinizing claims. While the policy was in effect, Wausau administered forty claims for benefits. Because none of these claims met the high deductible, Cone was financially responsible to pay the claims. Wausau billed Cone for $275,000 in claims service fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-14\">Count One of Cone\u2019s complaint alleges that Wausau\u2019s claims handling procedure breached the insurance contract. It asserts that Wausau breached its implied duty to act in the best interest of Cone as it administered workers compensation claims. Alternatively, this count alleges Wausau breached its independent fiduciary duty to act in the best interest of Cone. After filing its answer to the complaint, Wausau filed a motion for a judgment on the pleadings on the first count of the complaint. The district court granted the motion, reasoning that Georgia law<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> does not recognize a breach of contract claim based on the breach of either an implied or fiduciary duty of good faith.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-15\">In response to the court\u2019s entry of judgment on Count One of Cone\u2019s original complaint, Cone filed a motion to amend the complaint to add new claims for Bad Faith/Negligent Claims Handing and a claim for Breach of Fiduciary Duty/Improper Claims Handling. The court denied Cone\u2019s motion to add these counts. It held that an amendment would be futile because the counts would not withstand a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss. Cone now appeals, challenging both the district court\u2019s grant of Wausau\u2019s motion for judgment on the pleadings and the court\u2019s denial of Cone\u2019s motion for leave to amend its complaint. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"836\">*836</page-number>\u201cWe review <em>de novo </em>the grant of judgment on the pleadings by the district court.\u201d <em>Hardy v. Regions Mortg., Inc., </em>449 F.3d 1357, 1359 (11th Cir.2006) (citing <em>Moore v. Liberty Nat\u2019l Life Ins. Co., </em>267 F.3d 1209, 1213 (11th Cir.2001)). We accept the facts as stated in the plaintiffs complaint as true and view them in the light most favorable to the plaintiff. <em>Id. </em>\u201cIf upon reviewing the pleadings it is clear that the plaintiff would not be entitled to relief under any set of facts that could be proved consistent with the allegations, the court should dismiss the complaint.\u201d <em>Horsley v. Rivera, </em>292 F.3d 695, 700 (11th Cir.2002) (citing <em>White v. Lemacks, </em>183 F.3d 1253, 1255 (11th Cir.1999)).</p>\n<p id=\"b862-4\">When the district court granted Wau-sau\u2019s motion for judgment on the pleadings, it concluded that Georgia does not recognize an independent cause of action for breach of good faith and fair dealing. Then, it found that Cone\u2019s complaint did not allege the breach of any express term of the contract. The court continued by explaining that fiduciary duties between an insurer and insured only arise when the insurer is defending or settling a third-party tort claim on the behalf of the insured. Given that the circumstances of this case did not create this fiduciary duty, the court rejected Cone\u2019s claim of breach of a fiduciary duty.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-5\">On appeal, Cone does little to rebut the district court\u2019s reasoning. Instead, Cone argues that Wausau owed Cone a duty of good faith and fair dealing that could be implied from the contract, arose from the industry standard of care for claims handling, or derived from the doctrine of necessary implication. None of these arguments respond to the fundamental flaw the district court found with Cone\u2019s original complaint. The complaint as drafted states an independent breach-of-contract cause of action for breach of the duty of good faith. The district court decided Georgia law does not recognize this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-7\">We agree with the district court\u2019s analysis of Georgia law on this issue. <em>See Alan\u2019s of Atlanta, Inc. v. Minolta Corp., </em>903 F.2d 1414, 1429 (11th Cir.1990) (holding that Georgia law does not recognize claim for breach of implied covenant of good faith); <em>Onbrand Media v.Codex Consulting, Inc., </em>301 Ga.App. 141, 687 S.E.2d 168, 174 (2009) (citations omitted) (stating that implied covenant of good faith does not provide independent basis of liability). Cone\u2019s complaint does not allege Wausau breached an express term of the insurance contact but instead relies on the breach of the implied duty of good faith. This is not a proper ground for a breach of contract claim under Georgia law. Therefore, we hold that the district court did not err by granting Wausau\u2019s motion for judgment on the pleadings as to Count One of Cone\u2019s complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-8\">\u201cWe generally review the denial of a motion to amend a complaint for an abuse of discretion, but we review questions of law <em>de novo.\" Coventry First, LLC v. McCarty, </em>605 F.3d 865, 869 (11th Cir.2010) (quoting <em>Williams v. Bd. of Regents of Univ. Sys. of Ga., </em>477 F.3d 1282, 1291 (11th Cir.2007)). \u201c[W]e review <em>de novo </em>a decision that a particular amendment to the complaint would be futile.\u201d <em>Cockrell v. Sparks, </em>510 F.3d 1307, 1310 (11th Cir.2007) (citing <em>Harris v. Ivax Corp., </em>182 F.3d 799, 802 (11th Cir.1999)). If the complaint as amended would still be properly dismissed, then granting leave to amend is futile. <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Hall v. United Ins. Co. of Am., </em>367 F.3d 1255, 1263 (11th Cir.2004)).</p>\n<p id=\"b862-9\">Cone\u2019s arguments on appeal address the district court\u2019s denial of leave to amend to add Counts One and Two of the proposed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"837\">*837</page-number>amended complaint.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Count One of the proposed amended complaint alleges that Wausau owed Cone a duty to act in Cone\u2019s best interest. We agree with the district court that this count is simply an attempt to revive Count One that the district court dismissed on Wausau\u2019s motion for a judgment on the pleadings. Therefore, this amendment would be futile and the district court did not abuse its discretion by denying Cone\u2019s request to add this count.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-5\">Count Two of the proposed amended complaint alleges Wausau was Cone\u2019s agent and it breached its fiduciary duty to Cone. Cone fails to cite a single case applying Georgia law that recognizes a fiduciary duty in these circumstances based on this agency theory. While an insurer has a duty to act in good faith when the insurance company is defending or settling a third-party tort claim, <em>Thomas v. Atlanta Cas. Co., </em>258 Ga.App. 199, 558 S.E.2d 432, 439 (2001), those circumstances are not present in this case. Like the first count, an amendment to add this count would also have been futile because it fails to state a claim for relief. The district court did not err by denying Cone\u2019s motion for leave to amend.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b861-11\">. The parties do not dispute the district court\u2019s conclusion that Georgia law governs this diversity case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b863-8\">. To the extent Cone challenges the district court's disposition of the other counts in its proposed amended complaint, it has waived this issue. <em>See Greenbriar, Ltd. v. City of Alabaster, </em>881 F.2d 1570, 1573 n. 6 (11th Cir. 1989).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
