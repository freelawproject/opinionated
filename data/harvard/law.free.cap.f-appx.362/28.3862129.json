On appeal, Garza argues that he has met the requirements to receive a sentence below the mandatory minimum pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5C1.2 and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(f), also called \u201csafety valve relief.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b55-8\">We review a district court\u2019s denial of safety-valve relief for clear error. <em>See United States v. Cruz, </em>106 F.3d 1553, 1557 (11th Cir.1997). Further, we will not find clear error unless the review of the record leaves us \u201cwith the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\u201d <em>United States v. White, </em>335 F.3d 1314, 1319 (11th Cir.2003) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b55-9\">\u201cSafety-valve relief allows for sentencing without regard to any statutory minimum, with respect to certain offenses, when specific requirements are met.\u201d <em>United States v. Milkintas, </em>470 F.3d 1339, 1344 (11th Cir.2006) (quoting <em>United States v. Brehm, </em>442 F.3d 1291, 1299 (11th Cir.2006)); 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(f); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5C1.2. The five criteria are:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b55-11\">(1)the defendant does not have more than 1 criminal history point, as determined under the sentencing guidelines;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b55-13\">(2) the defendant did not use violence or credible threats of violence or possess a firearm or other dangerous weapon (or induce another participant to do so) in connection with the offense;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b55-14\">(3) the offense did not result in death or serious bodily injury to any person;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b55-15\">(4) the defendant was not an organizer, leader, manager, or supervisor of others in the offense, as determined under the sentencing guidelines and was not engaged in a continuing criminal enterprise, as defined in [\u00a7 408 of the Controlled Substances Act]; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b55-16\">(5) not later than the time of the sentencing hearing, the defendant has truthfully provided to the Government all information and evidence the defendant has concerning the offense or offenses that were part of the same course of conduct or of a common scheme or plan, but the fact that the defendant has no relevant or useful other information to provide or that the Government is already aware of the information shall not preclude a determination by the court that the defendant has complied with this requirement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b55-17\"><em>Milkintas, </em>470 F.3d at 1344-45; 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(f); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5C1.2(a). The defendant bears the burden of proving he is eligible for safety-valve relief. <em>Milkintas, </em>470 F.3d at 1345. Thus, to establish the fifth requirement, \u201c[t]he burden is on the defendant to come forward and to supply truthfully to the government all the information that he possesses about his involvement in the offense, including information relating to the involvement of others and to the chain of the narcotics distribution.\u201d <em>Cruz, </em>106 F.3d at 1557.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-18\">Because the parties do not dispute that Garza satisfied the first four requirements of the safety-valve, his appeal is limited to whether he satisfied the fifth requirement of affirmative disclosure. <em>Milkintas, </em>470 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>F.3d at 1344^5. As Garza acknowledges, he was willing to discuss his own criminal activities but was reluctant to discuss the activities of others involved. Garza was presented with two opportunities to discuss the information he possessed about the course of conduct surrounding his offense, but declined to discuss the role of any of the other defendants in his case. Therefore, we conclude that Garza failed to meet his burden of showing that he satisfied the affirmative disclosure requirement, and the district court did not err by denying him safety-valve relief under \u00a7 3555(f). <em>See Milkintas, </em>470 F.3d at 1345.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
