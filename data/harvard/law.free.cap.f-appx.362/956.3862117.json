Within the week, Wyant arrived with two men and his sister to retrieve \u201chis stuff.\u201d Wyant had previously requested a police presence from Chief Jake Fowler of the Fyffe police depart<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"957\">*957</page-number>ment, and Officer Tim Garrett was on the scene to prevent a breach of the peace. When Johnson said that her husband\u2019s things were in the garage, Officer Garrett told her that Wyant wanted more than the property in the garage, and he repeatedly encouraged her to let them in so that Wyant would not break down the door.</p>\n<p id=\"b983-5\">Johnson opened the door, and Wyant spent the next several hours removing furniture and other personal property from the residence. Officer Garrett remained on the scene to supervise and threatened Johnson and Wyant with arrest if either of them acted inappropriately. Both Officer Garrett and, via telephone, Chief Fowler explained to Johnson that her husband, as a titled co-owner and resident of the house, was entitled to enter it and take whatever he wanted. The court presiding over the couple\u2019s divorce action later awarded Johnson most of the property that Wyant took.</p>\n<p id=\"b983-6\">Johnson sued Garrett, Fowler, and the City of Fyffe under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1983 and 1985(3),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> alleging a deprivation of her due process rights and a conspiracy to discriminate against her because of her sex. The parties consented to a bench trial before a magistrate judge, who concluded that Johnson\u2019s civil rights had not been violated, that Garrett and Fowler were entitled to qualified immunity in any event, and that the City of Fyffe could not be held hable because it had no policy or custom deliberately indifferent to Johnson\u2019s rights. The court also rejected Johnson\u2019s conspiracy claim on the ground that she had not proven that any discriminatory animus motivated the defendants\u2019 actions. The court therefore entered judgment in favor of the defendants and dismissed Johnson\u2019s claims. She now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b983-10\">After a bench trial, we review the trial court\u2019s legal conclusions <em>de novo </em>and its factual findings for clear error. <em>Mitchell v. Hillsborough County, </em>468 F.3d 1276, 1282 (11th Cir.2006).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> To prevail on her \u00a7 1983 due process claim, Johnson must prove that she was deprived of a constitutionally protected property interest through state action without adequate process. <em>Grayden v. Rhodes, </em>345 F.3d 1225, 1232 (11th Cir.2003). To succeed under \u00a7 1985(3), she must prove the existence of a conspiracy to deprive her of the equal protection of the laws on the basis of her sex, an act in furtherance of the conspiracy, and a resulting injury. <em>Childree v. UAP/GA AG Chem., Inc., </em>92 F.3d 1140, 1146-47 (11th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b983-11\">We agree with the magistrate judge that Johnson has failed to establish a violation of her rights under \u00a7 1983. Officer Garrett and Chief Fowler correctly informed Johnson that the police could not prevent Wyant from entering his own home unless he breached the peace. Furthermore, until the judge in the couple\u2019s divorce proceedings awarded Johnson sole ownership of the marital property, the police had no responsibility to determine or enforce her disputed right to its possession. Officer Garrett did not help Wyant remove any property, and on these facts, his presence to keep the peace did not amount to a violation of Johnson\u2019s constitutional rights. <em>See Cofield v. Randolph </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"958\">*958</page-number><em>County Comm\u2019n, </em>90 F.3d 468, 471-72 (11th Cir.1996). In the absence of a constitutional violation, Johnson\u2019s \u00a7 1983 claim fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b984-4\">With respect to Johnson\u2019s conspiracy claim under \u00a7 1985(3), she presented no evidence at trial that the defendants had discriminated against her on the basis of her sex. Instead, she relied on an inference of sex-based discrimination from the fact that the defendants had allowed her husband, a man, to take property from their home. When asked whether Officer Garrett had done anything to suggest he was mistreating her because of her sex, Johnson responded, \u201cI don\u2019t know why he done what he done.\u201d Given the evidence presented at trial, the magistrate judge correctly concluded that there was no basis for Johnson\u2019s claim under \u00a7 1985(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b984-5\">Because Johnson established neither a deprivation of her rights nor a discriminatory conspiracy, the judgment of the magistrate judge is</p>\n<p id=\"b984-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b983-7\">. Johnson also sued Wyant and his sister, but those claims were settled before trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b983-8\">. Because the magistrate judge granted the defendants\u2019 motion for a \u201cdirected verdict\u201d under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 50, Johnson argues that we should apply the standard of review applicable to Rule 50 judgments and reverse if reasonable persons could reach a different conclusion than the magistrate judge. Rule 50, however, only applies in jury trials, and it is clear that the court entered a judgment in favor of the defendants at the conclusion of the bench trial. At any rate, our conclusions do not turn on this distinction in the applicable standard of review.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
