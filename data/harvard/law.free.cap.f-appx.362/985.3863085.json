Flores, Jose Grullon, Maria Dolores Aleman Cardenal, and Carlos Miguel Aleman Cardenal (the claimants) appeal the district court\u2019s award of attorney\u2019s fees and costs in their favor pursuant to the Civil Asset Forfeiture Reform Act (CAFRA), 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2465. In the underlying civil forfeiture action, the claimants successfully recovered the proceeds from five of seven certificates of deposit (CDs) seized by the Government. The claimants bring two issues on appeal, which we address in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-6\">First, the claimants contend the district court erred in deducting a proportional amount of the total award requested to reflect the Government\u2019s partial judgment of forfeiture. Specifically, the claimants maintain the reversal of Arnoldo Ale-man\u2019s Nicaraguan convictions for money laundering and embezzlement renders the partial forfeiture invalid. The claimants first raised the argument regarding Arnoldo Aleman\u2019s exoneration in two Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b) motions for relief, both of which were filed after the claimants filed the present notice of appeal from their order awarding attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-7\">Pursuant to Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 3, we lack jurisdiction to review any judgment or order that comes after, and is otherwise not designated, in a notice of appeal. <em>McDougald v. Jenson, </em>786 F.2d 1465, 1474 (11th Cir.1986). The notice of appeal underlying the instant matter exclusively designates the district court\u2019s December 18, 2008, order awarding attorney\u2019s fees and predates the filing and disposition of the claimants\u2019 initial and renewed Rule 60(b) motions. Given the content and timing of the notice of appeal, we lack jurisdiction to review the district court\u2019s denial of the claimants\u2019 Rule 60(b) motions to amend the final order of forfeiture and the award of attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-8\">Additionally, as a general principle, arguments not properly raised before the district court are deemed waived and will not be considered on appeal. <em>Smith v. Sec\u2019y Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>572 F.3d 1327, 1352 (11th Cir.2009). As the argument regarding Aleman\u2019s acquittal was not within the district court\u2019s purview when it issued the relevant order for attorney\u2019s fees, the argument is not properly before this Court with regard to the present appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-9\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-10\">The claimants further contend the district court erroneously relied on the amount of the five recovered CDs at the time of them purchase, rather than the time of seizure. They assert the district court erred in (1) deducting a proportional amount of the total award requested, and (2) basing the award on the $450,000 value of the recovered CDs at the time of their purchase, rather than the $564,572 value at the time of their seizure.</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-11\">\u201cWe review the district court\u2019s decision to award costs and attorney\u2019s fees for abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Mut. Serv. Ins. Co. v. Frit Indus., Inc., </em>358 F.3d 1312, 1326 (11th Cir.2004). Under CAFRA, a claimant who substantially prevails in a civil forfeiture proceeding is entitled to \u201creasonable attorney fees and other litigation costs reasonably incurred,\u201d as well as post-judgment interest. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2465(b)(1). Nonetheless, where a \u201ccourt enters judgment in part for the claimant and in part for the Government, the court shall reduce the award of costs and attorney fees accordingly.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 2465(b)(2)(D). Under the doctrine of invited error, however, we are precluded from reviewing an error on appeal where a party induces or invites that error. <em>United States v. Brannan, </em>562 F.3d 1300, 1306 (11th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-12\">Based on the information available to the district court at the time it issued <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"988\">*988</page-number>the award for attorney\u2019s fees, the court was statutorily obligated to reduce the award of costs and attorney\u2019s fees to reflect the two CDs successfully forfeited by the Government. In this regard, the district court did not abuse its discretion by dividing the total amount of attorney\u2019s fees requested by the total number of CDs involved in the case, and then deducting twice the average value of each CD to account for the Government\u2019s partial judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-4\">Further, although the district court should have relied on the value of the five recovered CDs at the time of their seizure, the claimants invited this error by expressly notifying the court they had recovered $450,000. Under the doctrine of invited error, the claimants are therefore precluded from arguing on appeal the district court should have relied on the $564,572 value of the CDs in calculating the amount of attorney\u2019s fees based on the 40% contingency fee arrangement.</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-5\">Consequently, the claimants have failed to demonstrate the district court abused its discretion in calculating an initial value of $180,000 in attorney\u2019s fees, which equals 40% of $450,000, and then deducting a proportional amount to reflect the Government\u2019s forfeiture of two of the seven CDs. Accordingly, we affirm the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
