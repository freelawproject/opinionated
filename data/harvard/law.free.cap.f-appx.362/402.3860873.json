Lewis challenges the propriety of his sentencing as a career offender, and he also argues that \u00a7 3582(c)(2) is applicable to his sentences based upon the retroactive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>amendments to the crack cocaine guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-5\">Lewis may not use a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion to challenge the appropriateness of the district court\u2019s application of a career offender enhancement in its calculation of his original sentences. <em>See United States v. Whitebird, </em>55 F.3d 1007, 1011 (5th Cir.1995). Further, the district court did not err in denying relief because \u201c[t]he crack cocaine guideline amendments do not apply to prisoners sentenced as career offenders.\u201d <em>United States v.
