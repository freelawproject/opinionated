After discovery commenced, Magistrate Judge Stephen Riedlinger recommended the dismissal of Smith\u2019s case when he repeatedly failed to meet discovery deadlines. The magistrate\u2019s recommendation was subsequently approved and the district court dismissed the suit on August 19, 2008. That judgment was not appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-20\">Smith then filed this suit on July 23, 2009 against Appellees the United States, Magistrate Judge Riedlinger, his former employer and its counsel, claiming that they fraudulently colluded to dismiss his suit. On August 3, 2009, a magistrate judge filed a report recommending that this suit be dismissed against all parties as frivolous pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915. The district judge accepted the magistrate\u2019s recommendations and entered judgment dismissing this suit with prejudice. Smith now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-21\">For the reasons thoroughly addressed in the magistrate judge\u2019s report, both the United States and Magistrate Judge Stephen Riedlinger are immune from suit. Additionally, Smith\u2019s brief to this court fails to address any issues regarding his former employer and its counsel. Therefore, Smith\u2019s arguments against Wacken-hut, Ryan, and Lemle Kelleher are waived and considered abandoned. <em>See Procter &amp; Gamble Co. v. Amway Corp., </em>376 F.3d 496, 499 (5th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b420-22\">Therefore, the district court\u2019s judgment is</p>\n<p id=\"b420-23\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b420-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
