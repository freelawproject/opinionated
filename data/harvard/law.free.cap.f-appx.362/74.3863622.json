Upon review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-5\">Clark was charged with conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute crack, possession with intent to distribute cocaine, and aiding and abetting the distribution of crack. The government filed notice of its intent to seek enhanced penalties under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(b)(1) and 851. After a jury trial, Clark was convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment based on the presentence investigation report (\u201cPSI\u201d) and the guidelines calculations.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-6\">On direct appeal, this court concluded that the sentence violated <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), because the judge, rather than the jury, had determined the amount of drugs involved in the offenses. Therefore, because the life sentence exceeded the maximum allowed under \u00a7 841(b)(1)(C), the court vacated and remanded for resentencing. The probation officer did not prepare a corrected PSI before resentencing. At resentencing in 2002, the district court reduced the sentence to the statutory maximum of thirty years\u2019 imprisonment under \u00a7 841(b)(1)(C). This court affirmed the amended sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-7\">In 2008, Clark filed a <em>pro se </em>motion for a sentence reduction under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c), alleging that Amendment 706 would have reduced his guidelines range. The district court appointed counsel, who then filed a motion to withdraw as counsel. Upon consideration, the court denied the \u00a7 3582(c) motion, granted counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw, and affirmed the sentence imposed. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-8\">Clark argues that, because his original sentence was vacated for violating <em>Appren-di, </em>the district court improperly relied on the guideline calculations set forth in his original PSI when determining whether he was eligible for a sentence reduction. He also contends that the district court failed to (1) calculate his original and amended base offense levels and guideline ranges, (2) consider the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) sentencing factors, and (3) explain its reasons for denying a sentence reduction.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-10\">We review a district court\u2019s decision whether to reduce a sentence under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) for abuse of discretion and its conclusions regarding the scope of its legal authority <em>de novo. United States v. Williams, </em>549 F.3d 1337, 1339 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b101-11\">A district court may modify a term of imprisonment in the case of a defendant who was sentenced based on a sentencing range that subsequently has been lowered by the Sentencing Commission. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). Any reduction, however, must be \u201cconsistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d <em>Id. </em>A reduction of a term of imprisonment is not \u201cconsistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission,\u201d and thus is not authorized under \u00a7 3582(c)(2), if the retroactive amendment does not have the effect of lowering the defendant\u2019s applicable guideline range. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(2)(B). \u2018Where the statutorily authorized maximum sentence is less than the minimum of the applicable guideline range, the statutorily authorized maximum sentence shall be the guideline sentence.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5Gl.l(a). Under \u00a7 841(b)(1)(C), the statutory maximum sentence is thirty years\u2019 imprisonment. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b101-14\">Here, the district court properly denied Clark\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c) motion because Amendment 706 did not reduce Clark\u2019s guideline sentencing range and, therefore, Clark was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>not eligible for a sentence reduction. Although the government concedes that Clark\u2019s offense level was determined under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1, it explains that the total offense level was 46,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and the 2-level reduction under Amendment 706 would only reduce his level to 44, leaving his guidelines range unchanged and the statutory maximum under \u00a7 841(b)(1)(C) still applicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-4\">Moreover, Clark\u2019s arguments challenging his original sentencing calculations may not be raised in the present action, because \u00a7 8582(c)(2) proceedings do not constitute <em>de novo </em>resentencings. <em>United States v. Bravo, </em>203 F.3d 778, 781 (11th Cir.2000). Finally, because Clark was not eligible for a \u00a7 3582(c) sentence reduction, the court was not required to consider the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) sentencing factors, and any error in failing to calculate Clark\u2019s amended base offense level and guideline range was harmless. Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s denial of Clark\u2019s \u00a7 3582 motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b102-7\">. In its statement of reasons at sentencing, the district court indicated the offense level was 43. Clark concedes on appeal that it was 46. Even if the level was 43, Clark would not be entitled to relief under \u00a7 3582(c) because his sentencing range would be thirty years.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
