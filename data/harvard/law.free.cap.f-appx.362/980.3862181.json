After a thorough review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-20\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-21\">On December 19, 2007, Savannah-Chat-ham Metro Police conducted a traffic stop for tinted windows and a shattered rear taillight. As a police officer approached the driver to write the ticket, the officer observed Smith, the front-seat passenger, acting nervously. The officer removed Smith from the car and conducted a pat-down search, during which the officer found what he believed to be crack cocaine in Smith\u2019s pocket. After obtaining the driver\u2019s consent, the officer searched the car and found a firearm underneath Smith\u2019s seat and additional firearms at the feet of the two rear-seat passengers. In the center console, the officer found Ecstacy and another substance he believed to be crack cocaine.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Smith subsequently pleaded guilty in state court to possession of cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-22\">Smith was indicted in federal court for possession of a firearm by a convicted felon, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g), and possession of a firearm with an obliterated serial number, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(k). He pleaded guilty to the \u00a7 922(g) offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b1008-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"982\">*982</page-number>In calculating the sentencing guidelines range, the probation officer determined the base offense level to be 20 under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1 because Smith had a pri- or controlled substance conviction, namely cocaine possession in state court. The probation officer then included a four-level enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(6) for possession of a firearm in connection with another felony offense, which was, again, the possession of cocaine. The guidelines calculations yielded a guidelines range of 110 to 120 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1008-4\">Relevant to this appeal, Smith raised two objections to the sentencing calculations. First, he objected to the enhancement for possession of a firearm in connection with another felony because cocaine possession was not a drug-trafficking offense and there was no evidence the firearm facilitated his possession. Second, he argued that the government failed to prove that the substance taken from his pocket was cocaine and thus should not have been considered in determining his base offense level. The district court overruled the objections, finding that the firearm had the potential to facilitate the drug possession, and Smith had pleaded guilty to possession of cocaine in state court. Smith was sentenced to 110 months\u2019 imprisonment. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1008-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1008-6\">Smith raises two issues on appeal. First, he argues that the district court committed <em>Booker</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>error by determining his base offense level on the basis of facts neither found by a jury beyond a reasonable doubt nor admitted by him. Second, he argues that the district court incorrectly applied the \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(6) enhancement because it did not find that the firearm actually facilitated the other felony offense. We address each issue in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b1008-8\">In cases where <em>Booker </em>error is preserved, we review the constitutional challenge to the sentence <em>de novo. United States v. Chau, </em>426 F.3d 1318, 1321 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b1008-9\">In this case, we conclude that the district court committed no <em>Booker </em>error. Smith admitted to possessing cocaine by pleading guilty to the state possession charges. This was sufficient for the court to conclude that the enhanced base offense level was appropriate. As long as the district court views the guidelines as advisory, \u201cnothing in <em>[Booker </em>] prohibits the district court from imposing guideline enhancements based on facts found by the judge by a preponderance of the evidence.\u201d <em>United States v. Douglas, </em>489 F.3d 1117, 1129 (11th Cir.2007); <em>see also Chau, </em>426 F.3d at 1324 (explaining that the district court may find facts neither found by a jury nor admitted by the defendant and use them in formulating a sentence, as long as it properly applies the advisory guidelines).</p>\n<p id=\"b1008-10\">Smith next argues that the district court erroneously enhanced his sentence under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(6) because there was no evidence that the firearm was used in connection with the felony drug possession. Specifically, he argues that something more than \u201cmere spatial proximity\u201d is needed to satisfy the requirement that the firearm be used \u201cin connection with\u201d the underlying felony when a drug possession offense rather than a drug trafficking offense is involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b1008-11\">We review a district court\u2019s application and interpretation of the Guidelines <em>de novo, </em>and its factual findings for clear error. <em>United States v. Rhind, </em>289 F.3d 690, 693 (11th Cir.2002). The district court\u2019s determination that the defendant used a firearm \u201cin connection with\u201d anoth<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"983\">*983</page-number>er felony offense is a factual finding reviewed for clear error. <em>United States v. Whitfield, </em>50 F.3d 947, 949 n. 8 (11th Cir.1995). \u201cFor a factual finding to be clearly erroneous, this court, after reviewing all of the evidence, must be left with a definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\u201d <em>United States v. Rodriguez-Lopez, </em>363 F.3d 1134, 1137 (11th Cir.2004) (internal quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-5\">Under the guidelines, the court can apply a four-level increase if a felon possesses a firearm \u201cin connection with another felony offense.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(6). Smith\u2019s state-court conviction for possession of a controlled substance qualifies as \u201canother felony offense.\u201d <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1, comment. (n,14(C)).</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-6\">The term \u201cin connection with\u201d means the firearm \u201cfacilitated, or had the potential of facilitating, another felony offense.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1, comment. (n.l4(A)). We give the phrase \u201cin connection with\u201d its ordinary meaning and give it an expansive interpretation. <em>Rhind, </em>289 F.3d at 695. In certain circumstances, mere possession of a firearm can be enough to apply a sentencing enhancement utilizing the \u201cin connection with\u201d language. <em>United States v. Smith, </em>480 F.3d 1277, 1280 (11th Cir.2007); <em>United States v. Jackson, </em>276 F.3d 1231, 1234 (11th Cir.2001). Thus, according to its ordinary and natural meaning, the phrase \u201cin connection with\u201d does not require proof that the firearm actually facilitated the other felony offense. <em>Rhind, </em>289 F.3d at 695.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1009-7\">Here, we conclude that the district court did not commit error when it applied the \u00a7 2Kl.l(b)(6) enhancement. The guidelines require that the firearm possession facilitate \u201canother felony offense.\u201d Nothing in the guideline dictates that the other felony be a drug-trafficking offense. As is the case here, the other felony was the mere possession of cocaine, to which Smith pleaded guilty in state court. Because firearms are often tools of the drug trade, we agree with the district court that Smith\u2019s possession of the firearm had the potential to facilitate the underlying drug possession. <em>Smith, </em>480 F.3d at 1280. Accordingly, we AFFIRM.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1007-15\">.
