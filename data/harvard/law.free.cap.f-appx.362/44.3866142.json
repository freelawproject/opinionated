They argue that substantial evidence does not support the findings by the Board that Darmawan did not suffer past persecution in Indonesia and that it is not probable that she will be persecuted if she returns to Indonesia. We deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-21\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b71-22\">Suwito arrived in the United States from Indonesia on or about September 5, 2000, and his wife and daughter arrived on or about January 16, 2001. Suwito\u2019s visa entitled him to remain in the United States as a non-immigrant visitor until March 4, 2001, and Darmawan\u2019s and P.T.\u2019s visas entitled them to remain as nonimmigrant visitors until January 15, 2001. All three overstayed their visas.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>In October 2007, the United States initiated removal proceedings against Darma-wan, Suwito, and P.T. All three sought relief based on an application for asylum and withholding of removal that Darma-wan had filed in April 2003 after the one-year deadline for filing an application for asylum had expired. Darmawan\u2019s application listed Suwito and P.T. as derivative beneficiaries. In her application, Darma-wan stated that she feared that she would be persecuted if she were forced to return to Indonesia because she is a Christian of Chinese ethnicity.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-4\">An immigration judge held a hearing in December 2007 to determine whether Dar-mawan, Suwito, and P.T. were entitled to relief from removal. At the hearing, Dar-mawan first explained her unsuccessful effort to file an asylum application in 2001 and urged the immigration judge to excuse her late filing. Darmawan described five incidents to prove that she had suffered persecution in the past because of her religion or ethnicity while she lived in Indonesia.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-5\">Darmawan described two incidents of sexual harassment. Darmawan testified that, when she was approximately eleven years old, a middle-aged man grabbed her breast. In her application for asylum, Darmawan explained that this man said \u201chey Chinese\u201d as he assaulted her. Dar-mawan testified that when she was approximately fourteen years old a group of teenagers surrounded her and said \u201chey Chinese, shut up or we are going to rape you\u201d while one of the teenagers pulled up her skirt to expose her underwear.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-6\">Darmawan described one minor incident of rude behavior. Darmawan testified that, as a university student, she once refused to donate to a street performer. The street performer called Darmawan a \u201cstingy Chinese\u201d and struck her with a can.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-7\">Darmawan also testified about a burglary of her home during the riots of May 1998. Darmawan was at home with her daughter when a group of unknown men approached her house and began to ring the bell. Darmawan was frightened and hid in the bathroom with P.T. When the group pushed down the front door, Darmawan escaped with her daughter through a back door and ran to a friend\u2019s house. While Darmawan and P.T. were away, the men damaged and stole items from the home. The immigration judge also accepted as evidence a portion of an affidavit that Su-wito had filed as part of the asylum application that mentioned these riots.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-8\">Finally, Darmawan testified about an incident that she described as religious persecution. She stated that one evening, while she was at church for choir practice, she heard a group of men outside the church discussing their desire to \u201cburn down the church and kill all of the people inside.\u201d The men may have believed that a member of the church killed their friend in a car accident. The men did not enter the church, but they accosted Darmawan\u2019s pastor, who was in the parking lot, and beat him until he lost consciousness. Security officials arrived soon after the beating, spoke with the group of attackers, and informed the church members that if they paid the attackers, the attackers would leave. The members paid the attackers, and the attackers left after damaging the church.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-9\">After considering the evidence, the immigration judge denied relief. First, the immigration judge refused to excuse Darmawan\u2019s late filing of her asylum application. Second, the immigration judge concluded that Darmawan \u201cha[d] not demonstrated that she is eligible for withholding of removal.\u201d He explained that Darmawan was not entitled to a presumption that she would be persecut<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>ed upon her return to Indonesia because she \u201cha[d] not demonstrated that she suffered past persecution within the meaning of the act.\u201d <em>See Tan v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>446 F.3d 1369, 1375 (11th Cir.2006). He concluded that Darmawan had not established that individuals who the Indonesian government could not or would not control had perpetrated the two acts of sexual harassment. He also concluded that neither the burglary during the May 1998 riots nor the attack on Darmawan\u2019s church were so serious as to constitute persecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-5\">The immigration judge found that Dar-mawan had not established \u201can objective basis for her to fear future harm in Indonesia.\u201d <em>See id. </em>He explained that \u201cthere does not appear to be sufficient evidence in this record to show that [Dar-mawan] would be singled out for harm in Indonesia because of her ethnicity or because of her religion.\u201d The immigration judge found that Darmawan\u2019s family was currently living unmolested in Indonesia and explained that the \u201c[State Department] <em>Country Reports </em>in this case ... does not support a claim that [Darmawan] will be singled out for harm because of her ethnicity or because of her religion.\u201d Consequently, the immigration judge found that, \u201ctaken as a whole, ... the record in this case is insufficient to meet the high burden placed on [Darmawan] to show that there is a clear probability that she would be persecuted in Indonesia on account of a protected ground.\u201d The immigration judge also denied relief under the Convention Against Torture.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-6\">Darmawan, Suwito, and P.T. appealed to the Board, and the Board \u201cadoptfed] and affirm[ed] the Immigration Judge\u2019s thorough and well-reasoned decision.\u201d The Board first \u201cagreefd] with the Immigration Judge\u2019s analysis and conclusions on th[e] issue\u201d of Darmawan\u2019s untimely application for asylum. The Board then held that the \u201cImmigration Judge correctly concluded that [Darmawan] had not demonstrated past persecution or a clear probability of persecution for withholding of removal.\u201d Finally, the Board agreed that Darmawan \u201cfailed to show that it is more likely than not that she would be tortured within the scope of the Torture Convention.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b73-8\">II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b73-9\">\u201cA factual determination by the [Board] that an alien is statutorily ineligible for ... withholding is reviewed under the substantial evidence test.\u201d <em>Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1284 (11th Cir.2001). Where, as here, \u201cthe Board adopts the [immigration judge]\u2019s reasoning, we will review the [immigration judge]\u2019s decision as well.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The substantial evidence test \u201cmeans that the reviewing court must affirm the [Board]\u2019s decision if it is supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation marks omitted). \u201cWe have repeatedly emphasized that the test is highly deferential....\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cTo reverse the [immigration judge]\u2019s fact findings, we must find that the record not only supports reversal, but compels it.\u201d <em>Mendoza v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>327 F.3d 1283, 1287 (11th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b73-10\">III. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b73-11\">We must decide only whether Darma-wan is entitled to withholding from removal. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231. As Darmawan concedes, \u201cwe lack jurisdiction to consider her argument regarding the timeliness of h[er] asylum application.\u201d <em>Mendoza, </em>327 F.3d at 1287. Second, Darmawan \u201cdoes not raise any challenge in her brief to the denial of relief under the Convention Against Torture.... [T]hat issue is abandoned.\u201d <em>Sepulveda v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1226, 1228 n. 2 (11th Cir.2005). Fi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>nally, because \u201cthere are no derivative benefits associated with a grant of withholding of removal,\u201d Suwito and P.T. have no claim for withholding of removal. <em>Delgado v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>487 F.3d 855, 862 (11th Cir.2007). Consequently, we must review only the decision of the Board that Darmawan is not entitled to withholding of removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-4\">Darmawan argues that \u201c[w]hen the evidence is properly considered it is clear that [she] suffered past persecution in Indonesia.\u201d She also argues that, even if she did not suffer past persecution, \u201cany reasonable fact finder would conclude that [Darmawan], [a] Christian[ ] who [is][a] eit-izen[ ] of the most populous Muslim country in the world, ha[s] certainly demonstrated that it is more likely than not that [she] will be persecuted\u201d if she returns to Indonesia. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-5\">Substantial evidence supports the decision of the Board that Darmawan did not suffer past persecution. She presented no evidence that the government of Indonesia was \u201cunable or unwilling to protect her,\u201d <em>Lopez v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>504 F.3d 1341, 1345 (11th Cir.2007), from either the teenagers or the middle-aged man who sexually harassed her, or the street performer who struck her with a can for refusing to give him money, and we have explained that \u201cmere harassment does not amount to persecution,\u201d <em>Sepulveda, </em>401 F.3d at 1231. Darmawan failed to prove that either the burglary of her church or the single assault on her home during the 1998 riots were so \u201cextreme,\u201d <em>id., </em>as to rise to the level of persecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-6\">Substantial evidence also supports the decision that Darmawan failed to prove that she probably will be persecuted if she returns to Indonesia. Darmawan relies exclusively on the Country Reports published by the State Department to support her argument that she probably will be persecuted if she returns to Indonesia because there is a \u201cclear and increasing trend of violence against Christians and a government that either cannot or will not stop the attacks and discrimination,\u201d but the Reports contain evidence to the contrary. The 2006 Report states that \u201c[instances of discrimination and harassment of ethnic Chinese continued to decline compared with previous years.\u201d The 2006 Report also states that Indonesia officially recognizes Catholicism, which Darmawan practices, and respects freedom of religion.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-8\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b74-9\">The petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
