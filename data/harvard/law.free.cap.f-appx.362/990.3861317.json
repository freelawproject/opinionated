On appeal, Rosario argues that the district court erred in finding that it did not have the authority to reduce his sentence under Amendment 706, which reduced the base offense levels applicable to crack cocaine, because the presentence investigation report (\u201cPSI\u201d) held him responsible for having more than 4.5 kilograms of crack cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b1017-10\">\u201cWe review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s conclusions about the scope of its legal authority under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2).\u201d <em>United States v. James, </em>548 F.3d 983, 984 (11th Cir.2008). A district court may modify a term of imprisonment in the case of a defendant who was sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). Any reduction, however, must be \u201cconsistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d <em>Id. </em>A reduction of a term of imprisonment is not \u201cconsistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission\u201d \u2014 and is, therefore, not authorized under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) \u2014 if the retroactive amendment does not have the effect of lowering the defendant\u2019s applicable guideline range. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(2)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b1017-13\">In determining whether Amendment 706 reduced Rosario\u2019s guideline range, the district court was required to consider not only whether the amendment reduced the drug quantity base offense level, but whether \u00a7 4Bl.l(b) produced a higher offense level than his amended drug quantity offense level. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(b)(l) (the court \u201cshall determine the amended guideline range that would have been applicable to the defendant if the amendments) ... had been in effect at the time the defendant was sentenced\u201d). Proceedings under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) and \u00a7 1B1.10 do not constitute <em>de novo </em>resentencing, and all original sentencing determinations remain unchanged with the sole exception of the guideline range that has been amended since the original sentencing. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(3); <em>United States v. Scott, </em>315 Fed.Appx. 895 (11th Cir.2009). We have held that a defendant accountable for more than 4.5 kilograms of cocaine is not eligible for a sentence reduction under Amendment 706. <em>United States v. Jones, </em>548 F.3d 1366, 1369 (11th Cir.2008), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 1657, 173 L.Ed.2d 1025 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b1017-15\">Here, the record reveals that Rosario was originally sentenced based upon 4.75 kilograms of crack cocaine that was attributed to him.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> As such, he was not eligible <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"992\">*992</page-number>for a sentence reduction, and the district court properly denied his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion. Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s order denying Rosario a sentence reduction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1018-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1017-11\">. Even if we assume <em>arguendo </em>that the PSI attributed to Rosario less than 4.5 kilograms of cocaine, as the parties suggest, we nevertheless find that he is ineligible for a sentence reduction because he is a career offender. <em>See United States v. Moore, </em>541 F.3d 1323, 1327-28 (11th Cir.2008), <em>cert. </em>denied, - U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 965, 173 L.Ed.2d 156 (2009) (holding that Amendment 706 had no effect on a career offender's applicable guideline range).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
