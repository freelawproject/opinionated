She contends that, even if her persecutors were partially motivated by criminal or econom<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"947\">*947</page-number>ic reasons, this is a case of \u201cmixed motives\u201d because the most meaningful motive for her persecution was political. Mora also argues that the IJ and the BIA erred in denying her relief under the CAT.</p>\n<p id=\"b973-5\">When the BIA issues a decision, we review only that decision, except to the extent that the BIA expressly adopts the IJ\u2019s decision. <em>Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1284 (11th Cir.2001). In this case, because the BIA expressly agreed with the IJ\u2019s findings and conclusions as to Mora\u2019s eligibility for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the CAT, we review both decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b973-6\">We review legal determinations of the IJ and BIA <em>de novo, </em>and \u201cadministrative fact findings under the highly deferential substantial evidence test.\u201d <em>Rivera v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>487 F.3d 815, 820 (11th Cir. 2007) (quotation omitted). In the process of reviewing the administrative fact findings, we may not \u201creweigh the evidence from scratch.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotations omitted). Rather, we may disregard such findings \u201conly when the record compels a reversal; ... that the record may support a contrary conclusion is not enough to justify a reversal of the administrative findings.\u201d <em>Silva, </em>448 F.3d at 1236 (quotations omitted). <em>See I.N.S. v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 481 n. 1, 112 S.Ct. 812, 815 n. 1, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992) (noting that the record must compel a reasonable factfinder to reverse). Under the substantial evidence test, we view the record \u201cin the light most favorable to the agency\u2019s decision and draw all reasonable inferences in favor of that decision.\u201d <em>Adefemi v. Ashcroft, </em>386 F.3d 1022, 1027 (11th Cir.2004) <em>(en banc). </em>At the end of the day, we must affirm the decisions of the IJ and BIA if they are \u201csupported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u201d <em>Silva v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>448 F.3d 1229, 1236 (11th Cir.2006) (quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b973-8\">To establish eligibility for asylum, an applicant must show that she is a \u201crefugee\u201d as defined in 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(1). To meet this definition, the applicant bears the burden of proving, with credible evidence, that the applicant was the victim of past persecution on account of her political opinion or any other protected ground, or that she has a \u201cwell-founded fear\u201d of future persecution because of her political opinion or other protected ground. <em>Rodriguez Morales v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>488 F.3d 884, 890 (11th Cir.2007); <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(1). A \u201cwell-founded fear\u201d exists if an applicant can prove that the fear is \u201csubjectively genuine and objectively reasonable\u201d and is on account of a political opinion or other protected ground. <em>Silva, </em>448 F.3d at 1236 (quotation omitted). The applicant must establish a sufficient nexus between her political opinion or other protected ground and her alleged persecution. <em>Rodriguez Morales, </em>488 F.3d at 890. Persecution \u201con account of\u2019 a political opinion means persecution because of the \u201cvictim\u2019s political opinion, not the persecutor\u2019s.\u201d <em>Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. at 482, 112 S.Ct. at 816 (emphasis omitted). The fact that the persecutor is motivated by his political belief is irrelevant to the issue of whether the victim was persecuted because of her own belief. <em>Rodriguez Morales, </em>488 F.3d at 890.</p>\n<p id=\"b973-9\">If an applicant can show that persecution was, at least in part, motivated by a protected ground, then she may be eligible for asylum and withholding of removal because of the persecutor\u2019s \u201cmixed motive.\u201d <em>Rivera, </em>487 F.3d at 821. Under the \u201cmixed motive theory,\u201d if an asylum applicant can prove \u201cwith specific and credible evidence\u201d that she was persecuted or has a well-founded fear of future persecution on account of a protected ground, it does not matter that there may be additional motives for the persecutors\u2019 actions. If the record compels the finding that at least <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"948\">*948</page-number>one of the persecutors\u2019 motivations involved a protected ground, then an applicant may be able to qualify for relief. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b974-4\">To be granted withholding of removal under the INA, an alien must show that her life or freedom would be threatened on account of her political opinion or other protected ground. <em>Sanchez v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>392 F.3d 434, 437 (11th Cir.2004). When seeking withholding <em>of </em>removal, \u201c[a]n alien bears the burden of demonstrating that [s]he more-likely-than-not would be persecuted or tortured upon [her] return to the country in question.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted). To qualify for CAT relief, an alien must show \u201cthat it is more likely than not that [she] would be tortured if removed to the proposed country of removal,\u201d and that such torture would be by or with the consent of a public official or person acting in an official capacity. <em>Sanchez Jimenez v. U.S. Attn\u2019y Gen., </em>492 F.3d 1223, 1239 (11th Cir.2007) (quotation omitted). If an asylum applicant fails \u201cto establish a claim of asylum on the merits, [s]he necessarily fails to establish eligibility for withholding of removal or protection under CAT.\u201d <em>Forgue v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1282, 1288 n. 4 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b974-5\">After reviewing the record in this case, we are satisfied that substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s and the BIA\u2019s determinations that Mora failed to show a nexus between any actions that targeted her and her political opinion. She was therefore ineligible for asylum, withholding of removal, and CAT relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b974-6\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b972-15\">. Jacqueline Rodriguez Mora is the lead petitioner in this case. The three remaining petitioners are derivative to her applications for relief and the instant petition for review. Therefore, unless otherwise indicated, we refer to petitioners as Mora.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
