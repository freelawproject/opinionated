Brooks argues that sentencing him for a powder cocaine offense rather than a crack cocaine offense would have resulted in a fairer sentence, in light of his acceptance of responsibility and \u201cdrug dependent status.\u201d He also notes that the 10-year statutory minimum set forth in 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(B)(Hi) would not apply if he were sentenced for a powder cocaine offense. For the reasons set forth below, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1015-9\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1015-10\">Brooks pled guilty to possession with intent to distribute five grams or more of crack cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(l)(B)(iii).</p>\n<p id=\"b1015-11\">According to the presentence investigation report (\u201cPSI\u201d), on March 8, 2008, Brooks was arrested for non-payment of child support. During a search incident to arrest, officers found on Brooks\u2019s person two containers holding a total of 5.8 grams of crack cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b1015-12\">The PSI set Brooks\u2019s base offense level at 24, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c)(8), because his offense involved at least 5 grams, but less than 20 grams of crack cocaine. Brooks received a two-level reduction under \u00a7 8El.l(a), for acceptance of responsibility, resulting in a total offense level of 22. Brooks\u2019s total offense level of 22 combined with criminal history category VI to yield a guideline imprisonment range of 84-105 months. However, because Brooks was subject to a mandatory term of imprisonment of 10 years, pursuant to 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(b)(l)(B)(iii), his guideline imprisonment range became 120 months (10 years).</p>\n<p id=\"b1015-14\">The court adopted the factual statements and guideline calculations set forth in the PSI, with the exception of three factual paragraphs not affecting Brooks\u2019s guideline calculations. The court sentenced Brooks to 120 months\u2019 imprisonment, the mandatory statutory minimum, followed by 8 years of supervised release. The court asked the parties if they had final objections, and neither party objected to the sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1015-15\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1015-16\">Where a defendant fails to raise a sentencing issue before the district court, we review for plain error. <em>See United States v. Camacho-Ibarquen, </em>410 F.3d 1307, 1315 (11th Cir.2005). We will correct a plain error only if (1) an error occurred, (2) the error was plain, and (3) the error affected substantial rights. <em>United States v. Zinn, </em>321 F.3d 1084, 1087 (11th Cir.2003). \u201cIf all three conditions are met, [we] may then exercise [our] discretion to notice a forfeited error, but only if ... the error seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>United States v. Rodriguez, </em>398 F.3d 1291, 1298 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b1015-17\">Section 841 of Title 21 provides that an individual who possesses with intent to distribute 5 grams or more of crack cocaine after having previously been convicted of a felony drug offense \u201cshall be sentenced to a term of imprisonment which may not be less than 10 years.\u201d 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(l)(B)(iii). \u201cIt is well-settled that a district court is not authorized to sentence a defendant below the statutory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"990\">*990</page-number>mandatory minimum unless the government filed a substantial assistance motion pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(e) and U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1 or the defendant falls within the safety-valve of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(f).\u201d <em>United States v. Castaing-Sosa, </em>530 F.3d 1358, 1360 (11th Cir.2008). A defendant qualifies for the safety-valve exception of \u00a7 3553(f) only if he \u201cdoes not have more than 1 criminal history point.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(f)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b1016-4\">The Supreme Court has held that the Sentencing Guidelines are to be applied in an advisory fashion. <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 258-59, 125 S.Ct. 738, 764, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). However, <em>Booker </em>does not affect the mandatory nature of statutory minimum sentences. <em>See United States v. Ciszkowski, </em>492 F.3d 1264, 1270 (11th Cir.2007) (finding that, \u201c[ejven after <em>Booker, </em>the district court is bound by the statutory mandatory minimums\u201d). Likewise, in <em>Kimbrough, </em>the Supreme Court held that district courts have authority to grant a variance based on the craek-to-powder disparity, but it noted that district courts remain \u201cconstrained by the mandatory m\u00ednimums Congress prescribed in the 1986 Act.\u201d <em>Kimbrough v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 85, 108, 128 S.Ct. 558, 574, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b1016-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b1016-6\">Brooks has failed to establish that the district court committed any error, let alone plain error, in sentencing him to the mandatory minimum sentence. The government did not file a substantial assistance motion under either \u00a7 3553(e) or \u00a7 5K1.1 and Brooks did not qualify for the safety-valve exception, because he had more than one criminal history point. Thus, the district court would have committed reversible error if it had sentenced Brooks to less than 120 months. Furthermore, as noted above, neither <em>Booker </em>nor <em>Kimbrough </em>permit district courts to sentence defendants below the statutory minimum. <em>See id.; Ciszkowski, </em>492 F.3d at 1270. Accordingly, we affirm Brooks\u2019s 120-month sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1016-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
