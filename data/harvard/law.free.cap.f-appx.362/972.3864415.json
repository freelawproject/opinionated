INA \u00a7 241(b)(3), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3). The Board concluded that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"973\">*973</page-number>Mastrodomenico failed to establish past persecution or a well-founded fear of future persecution if he returns to Colombia. We deny Mastrodomenico\u2019s petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b999-5\">Mastrodomenico testified about several incidents with the National Liberation Party, but substantial evidence supports the finding of the Board that the incidents, even when considered cumulatively, do not rise to the level of past persecution. <em>See Kazemzadeh v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>577 F.3d 1341, 1353 (11th Cir.2009). Mastrodomenico, a member of the Atlantic Cattle Association, received an unspecified number of \u201cmessages\u201d from the National Liberation Party demanding cattle and money, and later Mastrodomenico\u2019s wife received a telephone call inquiring about Mastrodomenico\u2019s location, but these incidents constitute harassment, not persecution. <em>See Silva v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>448 F.3d 1229, 1237-38 (11th Cir.2006); <em>Sepulveda v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1226, 1231 (11th Cir.2005). Although Mastrodomenico testified he was kidnapped at a guerrilla checkpoint, chained to a tree for six hours, and beaten with knees and the butts of rifles when he refused to name other members of the Cattle Association or potential recruits, Mastrodomenico testified that he recovered from his minor injuries after he saw a psychiatrist and used anti-inflammatory medication prescribed by another doctor. <em>See Djonda v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>514 F.3d 1168, 1174 (11th Cir.2008); <em>Zheng v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>451 F.3d 1287, 1290-91 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b999-6\">Although Mastrodomenico argues that he suffered persecution \u201cbecause of his opinion and in part because of his social group,\u201d substantial evidence supports the finding of the Board that the incidents of alleged persecution were not attributable to a protected ground. Mastrodomenico testified that the National Liberation Party sought supplies and information about recruits to further their cause. Evidence that Mastrodomenico was harassed because he refused to cooperate with the guerrillas \u201cdoes not constitute evidence of persecution based on a statutorily protected ground.\u201d <em>Ruiz v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>440 F.3d 1247, 1258 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b999-8\">Substantial evidence also supports the finding that Mastrodomenico does not have a well-founded fear of future persecution. Although Mastrodomenico and his family fled to the United States after his kidnapping, Mastrodomenico\u2019s wife and children later returned to Colombia. Mastrodomenico asserts that the National Liberation Party has a pattern of persecution against persons who are similarly situated, but Mastrodomenico does not identify any similarly situated person who has been persecuted. Mastrodomenico withdrew from the Cattle Association and the record does not compel a conclusion that the National Liberation Party \u201cretains an inclination to single [him] out.\u201d <em>Sepulveda, </em>401 F.3d at 1231-32.</p>\n<p id=\"b999-9\">Mastrodomenico\u2019s petition is DENIED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
