INA \u00a7\u00a7 208, 241; 8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1158, 1231; 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(c). The Board denied the application based on a finding that Altuve and her husband, Luis Emigdio Primera, were not credible. We deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b1018-25\">We review adverse credibility findings for substantial evidence. <em>Chen v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>463 F.3d 1228, 1230-31 (11th Cir.2006). Adverse credibility findings will be reversed \u201c \u2018only if the evidence \u201ccompels\u201d a reasonable fact finder to find otherwise.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1231 (quoting <em>Sepulveda v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"993\">*993</page-number><em>U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1226, 1230 (11th Cir.2005)). An adverse credibility determination may be based on inconsistencies, inaccuracies, and falsehoods in the applicant\u2019s oral and written statements. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(l)(B)(iii).</p>\n<p id=\"b1019-4\">Substantial evidence supports the adverse credibility finding, <em>see Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1283-84 (11th Cir.2001), and the Board provided specific and cogent reasons to support that finding, <em>Chen, </em>463 F.3d at 1231. Altuve and her husband presented inconsistent, uncorroborated, and implausible testimonies about her alleged persecution in Venezuela. Altuve testified incredibly that she received death threats from the Bolivarian Circles because of her activities with First Justice, an organization that opposed Hugo Chavez, even though she was also employed by the Chavez government, allowed to transfer to a station closer to her home, and stated in a letter of resignation that she was \u201cgrateful\u201d to the agency \u201cfor the cooperation given.\u201d Altuve testified, on cross-examination, that members of the Bolivarian Circles did not target her during an opposition demonstration in April 2002, but Altuve\u2019s husband insisted that members \u201crecognized\u201d and attacked Altuve. Altuve and her husband also testified inconsistently about the number of marches they attended. Altuve\u2019s husband also testified that he saw Altuve receive two threatening telephone calls at home, but he changed his story when confronted with Altuve\u2019s testimony that she had received the calls at work. Altuve failed to provide any evidence to corroborate her story about being threatened by gunmen on a public bus in December 2005, and her testimony that she obtained medical treatment in March 2006 conflicted with her husband\u2019s testimony that she received immediate treatment. The record does not \u201c\u2018compel\u2019 a reasonable fact finder\u201d to credit the testimonies of Altuve and her husband. <em>Chen, </em>463 F.3d at 1233.</p>\n<p id=\"b1019-7\">Altuve\u2019s petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
