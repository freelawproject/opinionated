Welmaker contends that this sentence, which runs consecutively to the sentences for the offenses which gave rise to the revocation, is unreasonable. After careful review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-16\">We review a sentence imposed upon revocation of supervised release for reasonableness. <em>United States v. Velasquez Velasquez, </em>524 F.3d 1248, 1252 (11th Cir.2008). In reviewing sentences for reasonableness, we perform two steps. <em>United States v. Pugh, </em>515 F.3d 1179, 1190 (11th Cir.2008). First, we must \u201c\u2018ensure that the district court committed no significant procedural error, such as failing to calculate (or improperly calculating) the Guidelines range, treating the Guidelines as mandatory, failing to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, selecting a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts, or failing to adequately explain the chosen sentence \u2014 including an explanation for any deviation from the Guidelines range.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007)).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> If we conclude that the district court did not procedurally err, we must consider the \u201c\u2018substantive reasonableness of the sentence imposed under an abuse-of-discretion standard,\u2019 \u201d based on the \u201c \u2018totality of the circumstances.\u2019\u201d <em>Pugh, </em>515 F.3d at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>1190 (quoting <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. 586). \u201c[T]he party who challenges the sentence bears the burden of establishing that the sentence is unreasonable in the light of both the record and the factors in section 3553(a).\u201d <em>United States v. Thomas, </em>446 F.3d 1348, 1351 (11th Cir.2006) (quotation and brackets omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b148-4\">After considering the factors of \u00a7 3553(a), a district court may revoke a term of supervised release and impose a term of imprisonment if it determines by a preponderance of the evidence that a violation has occurred. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e)(3). The introduction to Chapter Seven of the Sentencing Guidelines, which sets forth the policy statements for violations of supervised release, provides that \u201cat revocation the court should sanction primarily the defendant\u2019s breach of trust .... [and] the sanction for the violation of trust should be in addition, or consecutive, to any sentence imposed for the new conduct.\u201d U.S.S.G., ch. 7, pt. A, cmt. 3(b). Section 7B1.3(f) of the Guidelines reiterates the Commission\u2019s policy that prison terms for release violations should be consecutive sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-5\">District courts are given statutory authority under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3584 to impose consecutive or concurrent sentences but must consider the factors of \u00a7 3553(a) in making that determination. This statute governs sentences for the violation of supervised release, thereby placing the decision to impose a consecutive revocation sentence within a district court\u2019s discretion. <em>United States v. Dees, </em>467 F.3d 847, 852 (3d Cir.2006). Further, \u201c[t]he weight to be accorded any given \u00a7 3553(a) factor is a matter committed to the sound discretion of the district court....\u201d <em>United States v. Clay, </em>483 F.3d 739, 743 (11th Cir.2007) (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b148-6\">Welmaker has failed to show that his consecutive sentence was proeedurally unreasonable. The parties do not dispute that the court correctly calculated the guideline range at 18-24 months. Even though the district court did not explicitly say that it was considering the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, the record supports that the court weighed and considered the factors as will be further discussed below. <em>See United States v. Dorman, </em>488 F.3d 936, 944 (11th Cir.2007) (holding that a district court\u2019s failure to articulate explicitly that it has considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors does not render a sentence proeedurally unreasonable if the record indicates that the court did, in fact, consider the sentencing factors). The court\u2019s emphasis on Welmaker\u2019s repetition of the identical crime during supervised release provided an adequate explanation for the consecutive nature of the sentence. Finally, the court was required to consider the policy statements of the Guidelines as part of its procedural requirement to consider \u00a7 3553(a) and there is no indication in the record that the Commission\u2019s policy was \u201cmechanically applied\u201d in the court\u2019s sentencing decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-8\">Welmaker also has failed to show that his sentence is substantively unreasonable. For starters, the sentence is not greater than necessary to achieve the purposes of sentencing. Indeed, Welmaker\u2019s argument that the sentencing factors were already sufficiently addressed by his 87-month sentences fails to acknowledge a goal of revocation sentences. The Guideline policy statements, which the district court must consider, adopt the view that the sentence for a supervised release violation should reflect the breach of trust inherent in the violation. This breach of trust is an independent, viable sentencing interest in any revocation case which can be addressed by a statutorily allowed consecutive sentence if the district court deems it appropriate. <em>See Dees, </em>467 F.3d at 852.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>In the instant case, the court\u2019s stated concern that Welmaker had committed the identical crime of unarmed bank robbery while under supervised release is sufficient to support a consecutive prison sentence for the breach of trust reflected in the violation. The court\u2019s recommendation for intensive drug treatment was not intended to address the breach of trust. In addition, the court\u2019s decision to impose a prison term at the low end of the guideline range also supports the conclusion that this sentence was not greater than necessary to comply with the purposes of sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-5\">Moreover, the record shows that the court heard the government\u2019s argument for a consecutive sentence based on \u00a7 3553(a) and rejected Welmaker\u2019s request for a concurrent sentence. The court\u2019s insistence on a consecutive sentence reflected its consideration of the nature, circumstances, and seriousness of Welmaker\u2019s supervised release violation and the need to protect the public from repeated offenses. The court also gave due consideration to Welmaker\u2019s personal history and characteristics by recommending drug treatment and by deciding to sentence at the low end of the guideline range based on the arguments Welmaker raised. Because Welmaker has not met his burden to show that the consecutive sentence was unreasonable, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b147-12\">. The \u00a7 3553(a) factors include: (1) the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant; (2) the need for the sentence imposed to afford adequate deterrence to criminal conduct, to protect the public from further crimes of the defendant, and to provide the defendant with training, medial care, or correctional treatment; (3) the Sentencing Guidelines\u2019 range; (4) pertinent Sentencing Commission policy statements; (5) the need to avoid unwarranted sentencing disparities among similarly situated defendants with similar records; and (6) the need to provide restitution to victims. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(1), (a)(2)(B)-(D), (a)(4)-(7).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
