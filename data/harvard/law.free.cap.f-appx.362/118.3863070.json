After review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-8\">L BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b145-9\">In 1993, a jury found Upshaw guilty of one count of conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute cocaine base. At his original sentencing, the district court held Upshaw accountable for 3 kilograms of cocaine base. Using this drug quantity, Upshaw\u2019s base offense level under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1(e)(3) (1993) was 38. However, because Upshaw had two prior qualifying felony convictions, Upshaw was designated a career offender.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b145-10\">The career offender provision, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1, instructs the district court that, \u201c[i]f the offense level for a career criminal from the table below is greater than the offense level otherwise applicable, the offense level from the table below shall apply.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1 (1993). Upshaw\u2019s base offense level under the career offender guideline table was 37, \u00a7 4B1.1(A) (1993), which with his criminal history category of VII yielded a guidelines range of 360 months\u2019 to life imprisonment. However, pursuant to \u00a7 4B1.1, the district court applied the greater offense level, 38, from \u00a7 2D1.1(c)(3) to calculate Upshaw\u2019s guidelines range. With a total offense level of 38 and a criminal history category of VI, Upshaw\u2019s guidelines range was 360 months\u2019 to life imprisonment. The district court imposed a 360-month sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-13\">In 2008, Upshaw filed this \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion based on Amendment 706 to the Sentencing Guidelines. Amendment 706 lowered by two levels most of the base offense levels in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c) applicable to crack cocaine offenses. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. app. C, amends. 706, 713. Up-shaw argued that he was eligible for a sentencing reduction because, after Amendment 706, his base offense level for 3 kilograms was 36 and his amended sentencing range was 324 to 405 months. The district court denied the \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion. The district concluded that, although Amendment 706 lowered Upshaw\u2019s base offense level for 3 kilograms under \u00a7 2Dl.l(c), it did not lower his sentencing range because Upshaw was a career offender under \u00a7 4B1.1, which also carried the original sentencing range of 360 months\u2019 to life imprisonment. Upshaw appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-14\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b145-15\">Under \u00a7 3582(c)(2), a district court has the authority to modify a defendant\u2019s term of imprisonment if the defendant\u2019s sentence was \u201cbased on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 994(o).\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2); <em>see also </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(l)-(2) (2009).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> However, \u201c[w]here a retroactively applicable guideline amendment reduces a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>defendant\u2019s base offense level, but does not alter the sentencing range upon which his or her sentence was based, \u00a7 3582(c)(2) does not authorize a reduction in sentence.\u201d <em>United States v. Moore, </em>541 F.3d 1323, 1330 (11th Cir.2008), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 965, 173 L.Ed.2d 156 (2009); <em>see also </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(2)(B). A reduction is not authorized if the amendment does not lower a defendant\u2019s applicable guidelines range \u201cbecause of the operation of another guideline or statutory provision.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10 cmt. n. 1(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b146-5\">In <em>Moore, </em>we concluded that a crack cocaine defendant whose offense level was determined by the career offender provision, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1, rather than \u00a7 2Dl.l(c), was not eligible for a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) reduction because Amendment 706 did not lower the sentencing range upon which the defendant\u2019s sentence was ultimately based. 541 F.3d at 1327. However, <em>Moore </em>did not address Upshaw\u2019s situation, that is, a crack cocaine defendant who was sentenced as a career offender, but whose ultimate offense level of 38 was determined by \u00a7 2Dl.l(c). In Upshaw\u2019s case, we conclude that his career offender status made him ineligible for a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) reduction.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-6\">Upshaw was designated a career offender at his original sentencing, and the district court applied \u00a7 4B1.1 to determine Upshaw\u2019s applicable offense level. The fact that Upshaw\u2019s offense level of 38 under \u00a7 2Dl.l(c) was higher than his offense level of 37 under \u00a7 4Bl.l\u2019s table does not change his career offender status. Thus, in determining whether Amendment 706 reduced Upshaw\u2019s sentencing range, the district court was required to consider not only whether the amendment reduced the offense level for 3 kilograms under \u00a7 2Dl.l(c), but also whether \u00a7 4Bl.l\u2019s table produced a higher offense level than his amended \u00a7 2Dl.l(c) offense level. <em>See United States v. Bravo, </em>203 F.3d 778, 781 (11th Cir.2000) (explaining that in recalculating the sentencing range under the amendment, only the amended guideline provision is substituted and all other guidelines determinations remain unchanged).</p>\n<p id=\"b146-8\">Had Amendment 706 been in effect at Upshaw\u2019s original sentencing, his \u00a7 2Dl.l(c) offense level (based on 3 kilograms of cocaine) would have been 36 instead of 38. <em>Compare </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c)(2) (2009) <em>with </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c)(3) (1993). But, his career offender offense level would have remained 37. Therefore, under \u00a7 4B1.1, the district court would have been required to apply the greater offense level of 37, and Up-shaw\u2019s guidelines range would have remained 360 months\u2019 to life imprisonment. Thus, Amendment 706 did not lower the sentencing range upon which Upshaw\u2019s sentence was based, and the district court was not authorized by \u00a7 3582(c)(2) to reduce Upshaw\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b145-11\">. At sentencing, Upshaw did not object to his status as a career offender or his criminal history, which included the two qualifying felony convictions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b145-16\">.
