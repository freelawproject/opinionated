Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b1021-12\">Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56(c) provides that a court shall render summary judgment if \u201cthere is no genuine issue as to any material fact\u201d and \u201cthe movant is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c). We review the grant of summary judgment <em>de novo, </em>reviewing the record in the light most favorable to the non-moving party. <em>See Reed v. Heil Co., </em>206 F.3d 1055, 1061 (11th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b1021-13\">However, when a magistrate notifies a party of her right to object to the magistrate\u2019s factual findings \u201cand a party still fails to object to the findings of fact and those findings are adopted by the district court the party may not challenge them on appeal in the absence of plain error or manifest injustice.\u201d <em>Resolution Trust Corp. v. Hallmark Builders, </em>996 F.2d 1144, 1149 (11th Cir.1993). For us to correct an error under plain error review, there \u201cmust (1) be error, (2) that is plain, (3) that affects the substantial rights of the party, and (4) that seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of a judicial proceeding.\u201d <em>Brough v. Imperial Sterling Ltd., </em>297 F.3d 1172, 1179 (11th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b1021-15\">We generally do not consider an argument raised for the first time on appeal. <em>Narey v. Dean, </em>32 F.3d 1521, 1526 (11th Cir.1994). This rule is subject to five exceptions: (1) the issue involves a pure question of law and refusing to address it would result in a miscarriage of justice, (2) the appellant had no opportunity to raise the argument at the district court level, (3) the interest of substantial justice is at stake, (4) the proper resolution of the issue is beyond any doubt, and (5) the issue presents a significant question of general impact or great public concern. <em>Id. </em>at 1526-27. We also do not consider issues raised for the first time in an appellant\u2019s reply brief. <em>Lovett v. Ray, </em>327 F.3d 1181, 1183 (11th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b1021-16\">Because Revere did not file objections to the magistrate\u2019s Report and Recommendation, we review Revere\u2019s objections to the factual findings of the district court only for plain error or manifest injustice. <em>See Resohition Trust Corp., </em>996 F.2d at 1149. We also will not consider Revere\u2019s arguments raised for the first time on appeal, namely the following: (1) she was qualified for a promotion to a GS-13 position, because she had been doing work at a GS-12 level for at least a year before she sought the promotion; and (2) Revere\u2019s commander promoted his white secretary to a GS-12 position only six months after the secretary\u2019s arrival and without the approval of the board. <em>See Narey, </em>32 F.3d at 1526-27. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"996\">*996</page-number>We also will not consider Revere\u2019s arguments raised for the first time in her reply-brief, namely the following: (1) the government retaliated against her by refusing to allow her to enter into a new contract; (2) the government failed to show a legitimate reason for reassigning her to the Jacksonville District; and (3) the government deprived her of a property interest without due process of law when it refused to promote her to a GS-12 position. <em>See Lovett, </em>327 F.3d at 1183.</p>\n<p id=\"b1022-4\">II. Government\u2019s Filing of Criminal Charges</p>\n<p id=\"b1022-5\">On appeal, Revere argues that the government was not entitled to summary judgment because the government misrepresented to the court in its motion for summary judgment that it had not filed criminal charges against her, when, in fact, it had filed charges. She contends that the government\u2019s correction in a footnote of its reply brief to the district court was insufficient, and the government should have filed an amended statement of material facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b1022-6\">As noted, above, appellate review of the magistrate\u2019s factual findings is limited to plain error, because Revere failed to object. <em>See Resolution Trust Corp., </em>996 F.2d at 1149. Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56(e)(2) states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1022-7\">When a motion for summary judgment is properly made and supported, an opposing party may not rely merely on allegations or denials in its own pleading; rather, its response must \u2014 by affidavits or as otherwise provided in this rule \u2014 set out specific facts showing a genuine issue for trial. If the opposing party does not so respond, summary judgment should, if appropriate, be entered against that party.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1022-8\">Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(e)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b1022-9\">Because the government\u2019s misrepresentation to the court, later corrected, that it had not filed criminal charges against Revere had no effect on the court\u2019s decision, the district court did not err in granting summary judgment to the government, despite this misrepresentation. Furthermore, because Revere did not properly respond to the government\u2019s statement of material facts, the court did not plainly err in adopting the government\u2019s statement. Consequently, Revere\u2019s argument that the government\u2019s statement omitted material facts and should have been amended are without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1022-11\">III. Failure to Promote, Disparate Treatment, and Retaliation Claims</p>\n<p id=\"b1022-12\">On appeal, Revere asserts the government discriminated and retaliated against her for filing an EEOC complaint, by taking several adverse employment actions. First, she asserts she was referred to the Criminal Investigation Division due to her travel voucher irregularities, even though a white employee with similar irregularities was not investigated. Second, an adverse action occurred when she was not promoted from a GS-11 position to a GS-12 position, because she lost pay and benefits. Third, the government\u2019s reasons for her non-selection to the GS-13 EEO Manager Position, that she did not have one-year of experience at the GS-12 level, was pretext.</p>\n<p id=\"b1022-13\">\n<em>Failure to promote, disparate treatment</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1022-14\">In a failure-to-promote case, the plaintiff may satisfy her burden of establishing a <em>prima facie </em>case of discrimination by showing that (1) she belongs to a protected class, (2) she applied for and was qualified for a promotion, (3) she was rejected despite her qualifications, and (4) other equally or less-qualified employees outside her class were promoted. <em>Wilson v. B/E Aerospace, Inc., </em>376 F.3d 1079, 1089 (11th Cir.2004). The comparators for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"997\">*997</page-number>fourth prong must be \u201csimilarly situated in all relevant respects.\u201d <em>Holifield v. Reno, </em>115 F.3d 1555, 1562 (11th Cir.1997). The comparator must have been accused of the same or similar conduct but disciplined differently. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1023-5\">Once a <em>prima facie </em>case of discrimination has been established, the burden then shifts to the defendant, who must \u201carticulate some legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason\u201d for the allegedly discriminatory actions. <em>McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, </em>411 U.S. 792, 802, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 1824, 36 L.Ed.2d 668 (1973). The plaintiff may then attack the defendant\u2019s legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason \u201ceither directly by persuading the court that a discriminatory reason more likely motivated the employer or indirectly by showing that the employer\u2019s proffered explanation is unworthy of credence.\u201d <em>Brooks v. County Com\u2019n of Jefferson County, Ala., </em>446 F.3d 1160, 1163 (11th Cir.2006) (citations omitted). The plaintiff must show that the defendant\u2019s explanation is both false \u201cand that discrimination was the real reason.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1023-6\">Revere has failed to establish a <em>prima facie </em>case of discrimination based upon the government\u2019s failure to promote her to the GS-13 position. Another African-American woman was promoted to the GS-13 position that Revere sought. Furthermore, she had not been in a GS-12 position for at least one year, as required for the promotion. Thus, she has failed to demonstrate that (1) someone outside her protected class was promoted to the position she sought; or (2) she was qualified for the promotion that she sought. Revere has also failed to rebut the government\u2019s legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for failing to promote her to the GS-12 position, and for investigating her travel reimbursement irregularities. Revere admits that the investigation showed a variety of travel irregularities. Moreover, the nature and number of her irregularities were different from the white male comparator she presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-8\">Retaliation</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-9\">To establish a <em>prima facie </em>case of retaliation under Title VII, a plaintiff must show that (1) she engaged in statutorily protected expression, (2) she suffered an adverse employment action, and (3) there was some causal connection between the two events. <em>Pennington v. City of Huntsville, </em>261 F.3d 1262, 1266 (11th Cir.2001). A plaintiff satisfies the causal-relationship prong if she provides sufficient evidence that her employer had knowledge of the protected expression and \u201cthat there was a close temporal proximity between this awareness and the adverse ... action.\u201d <em>Higdon v. Jackson, </em>393 F.3d 1211, 1220 (11th Cir.2004) (noting that the Supreme Court cited with approval decisions holding that a three to four month disparity is insufficient to establish a causal connection).</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-10\">Once a plaintiff has established a <em>prima facie </em>case, the employer then has an opportunity to articulate a legitimate, non-retaliatory reason for the challenged employment action. <em>Pennington, </em>261 F.3d at 1266. If the employer proffers such an explanation, the burden shifts back to the plaintiff to prove that the defendant\u2019s explanation is merely a pretext. <em>Lubetsky v. Applied Card Sys., Inc., </em>296 F.3d 1301, 1305 (11th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-11\">Because Revere did not establish a causal connection between her EEO activities and the adverse employment actions taken against her, the district court did not err in finding that Revere had failed to establish a <em>prima facie </em>case of retaliation. The district also did not err in finding that, even if Revere had established a <em>prima facie </em>case of retaliation, Revere had failed to prove that the government\u2019s legitimate, non-retaliatory reasons for investigating <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"998\">*998</page-number>her travel reimbursement irregularities and not promoting her to the GS-12 position, were pretextual.</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-4\">IV. Equal Pay Claim</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-5\">On appeal, Revere argues that the government was not entitled to summary judgment where it refused to promote her and \u201cpaid her less money for the higher graded work that she performed.\u201d She asserts that, even though she performed the same work, she was paid less than Pine McCollough, a male in a GS-12 position. She asserts that General Peter Mad-sen refused to promote her to the GS-12 level because of the investigations and assumed she was guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-6\">The EPA provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1024-7\">[n]o employer ... shall discriminate ... between employees on the basis of sex by paying wages to employees ... at a rate less than the rate at which he pays wages to employees of the opposite sex ... for equal work on jobs the performance of which requires equal skill, effort, and responsibility, and which are performed under similar working conditions, except where such payment is made pursuant to (I) a seniority system; (ii) a merit system; (iii) a system which measures earnings by quantity or quality of production; or (iv) a differential based on any other factor other than sex.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1024-8\">29 U.S.C. 206(d)(1). An employee demonstrates a prima <em>facie </em>case of an EPA violation by showing that the employer paid employees of opposite genders different wages for equal work for jobs which require equal skill, effort, and responsibility, and which are performed under similar working conditions. <em>Steger v. Gen. Elec. Co., </em>318 F.3d 1066, 1077-78 (11th Cir.2003). \u201cMoreover, \u2018[t]he <em>prima facie </em>case ... focuses solely on the primary duties of each job, not duties that are incidental or insubstantial,\u2019 and, although formal job titles or descriptions may be considered, the controlling factor in the court\u2019s assessment of whether two jobs are substantially equal must be actual job content.\u201d <em>Arrington v. Cobb County, </em>139 F.3d 865, 876 (11th Cir.1998) (citation omitted). Similarly, a plaintiff may establish a <em>prima facie </em>equal-pay violation of Title VII by showing that she is female and her job was substantially similar to higher paying jobs occupied by males. <em>Mulhall v. Advance Security, Inc., </em>19 F.3d 586, 598 (11th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-10\">Because Revere did not establish that a similarly situated male comparator had received higher pay, the district court did not err in finding that Revere had failed to establish a <em>prima facie </em>case of discrimination under the Equal Pay Act. Additionally, even if Revere had established a <em>prima facie </em>case, the difference between Revere\u2019s pay and a potential male comparator was based on a \u201cfactor other than sex,\u201d and so did not violate the Equal Pay Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-11\">V. Motion for Reconsideration</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-12\">On appeal, Revere argues that the court should have granted her motion for reconsideration because the documents that she and the government submitted showed genuine issues of material fact and the government admitted that she had suffered an adverse personnel action. She also asserts that she has a meritorious claim and granting her motion would not prejudice the government.</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-13\">We review a district court\u2019s denial of a Rule 60(b) motion for abuse of discretion. <em>Crapp v. City of Miami Beach, </em>242 F.3d 1017, 1019 (11th Cir.2001). A district court abuses its discretion when it makes an error of law. <em>Quintana v. Jenne, </em>414 F.3d 1306, 1309 (11th Cir.2005). Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b) allows a party to move a court for relief from a final judgment due to mistake or excusable neglect. Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b1025-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"999\">*999</page-number>A party seeking relief on the basis of excusable neglect must show that (1) \u201cit had a meritorious defense that might have affected the outcome,\u201d \u201cgranting the motion would not result in prejudice to the opposing party,\u201d and \u201cgood reason\u201d existed for the party\u2019s omission. <em>E.E.O.C. v. Mike Smith Pontiac GMC, Inc., </em>896 F.2d 524, 528 (11th Cir.1990) (denying the appellant\u2019s request to set aside an entry of default on the basis of excusable neglect). We are wary of granting Rule 60(b) relief for excusable neglect based on claims of attorney error. <em>Cavaliere v. Allstate Ins. Co., </em>996 F.2d 1111, 1115 (11th Cir.1993). In <em>Solaroll Shade and Shutter Corp. v. Bio-Energy Sys., Inc., </em>803 F.2d 1130, 1132 (11th Cir.1986), we rejected the appellant\u2019s argument that the \u201coversight\u201d of counsel in failing to respond to a motion was excusable neglect under Rule 60(b), even though such a result \u201cappeared] to penalize innocent clients for the forgetfulness of their attorneys.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1025-6\">Because Revere has failed to present a \u201cgood reason\u201d for her attorney\u2019s failure to file exhibits electronically or a \u201cmeritorious defense that might have effected the outcome,\u201d the negligence of Revere\u2019s attorney did not constitute excusable neglect. Consequently, the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Revere\u2019s motion for reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b1025-7\">Upon careful consideration of the briefs of the parties and thorough review of the record, we affirm the district court\u2019s grant of the government\u2019s motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1025-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
