The single-count complaint alleged that Hartford breached a group disability insurance policy (\u201cthe Policy\u201d) by \u201cwrongly terminat[ing]\u201d Amos\u2019s benefits under the Policy. (Record Excerpts 1-1.) Hartford removed the case to the United States District Court for the Northern District of Alabama because Amos\u2019s claim arises under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001, et seq.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-9\">On Hartford\u2019s motion, the district court dismissed Amos\u2019s complaint with prejudice, finding that her claim was barred by a contractual limitation of action provision in the Policy. In the same order, the district court denied Amos\u2019s motion for remand to the plan administrator so that Hartford could consider medical records that it had not considered previously, finding that remand was inappropriate because the limitations period had expired. Amos appeals the dismissal and denial of remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-10\">After review of the briefs and record, we affirm. The district court properly held that the three-year limitations period in the Policy is enforceable and, even if it was tolled while administrative remedies were pursued, Amos\u2019s suit was filed after the limitations period expired. And, we agree with the district court that remand for further consideration by the plan administrator is not appropriate under these circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
