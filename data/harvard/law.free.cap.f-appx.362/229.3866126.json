We will dismiss pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)\u00ae.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-26\">In 1983, a jury sitting in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York convicted Rice of participating in a Continuing Criminal Enterprise, possession with intent to deliver heroin, conspiracy, and violations of the Racketeer Influence and Corrupt Organizations Act. The district court sentenced him to life in prison without parole. The Second Circuit affirmed his conviction and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>the district court denied his first motion to vacate his sentence under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. <em>See United States v. Thomas, </em>757 F.2d 1359 (2d Cir.1985) (affirming conviction); <em>Rice v. United States, </em>118 F.Supp.2d 451 (S.D.N.Y.2000) (denying \u00a7 2255 motion). In 2002, Rice filed a petition for writ of habeas corpus pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania attempting to challenge his conviction. The District Court denied the petition and we affirmed. <em>See Rice v. Dodrill, </em>145 Fed.Appx. 729 (3d Cir.2005) (per curiam) (unpublished). In January, 2006 Rice filed a second motion to vacate in the Southern District of New York which the court denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-4\">In December 2008, Rice once again filed a \u00a7 2241 petition for writ of habeas corpus in the Middle District of Pennsylvania. Rice alleged that the jury\u2019s finding of guilt was insufficient to support his conviction inasmuch as the issue of the quantity of drug in his possession was not submitted to the jury and proven beyond a reasonable doubt, but was instead determined by the judge at sentencing and proven only by a preponderance of the evidence. The District Court dismissed Rice\u2019s petition for lack of jurisdiction. Rice filed a motion for reconsideration which the District Court also denied. Rice then filed a timely notice of appeal challenging the District Court\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-5\">We have jurisdiction over this appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1291 and 2253(a). We exercise plenary review over the District Court\u2019s legal conclusions and apply a clearly erroneous standard to its factual findings. <em>See Cradle v. United States ex rel. Miner, </em>290 F.3d 536, 538 (3d Cir.2002). Upon review, we agree with the District Court\u2019s dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-6\">A \u00a7 2255 motion is the presumptive means by which a federal prisoner can challenge his conviction or sentence. <em>See Davis v. United States, </em>417 U.S. 333, 343, 94 S.Ct. 2298, 41 L.Ed.2d 109 (1974). A federal prisoner may proceed under \u00a7 2241 only if the remedy provided by \u00a7 2255 is inadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his detention. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255; <em>In re Dorsainvil, </em>119 F.3d 245, 249-51 (3d Cir.1997). \u201cA \u00a7 2255 motion is inadequate or ineffective only where the petitioner demonstrates that some limitation of scope or procedure would prevent a \u00a7 2255 proceeding from affording him a full hearing and adjudication of his wrongful detention claim.\u201d <em>Cradle, </em>290 F.3d at 538.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-8\">Here, as the District Court held, Rice has not established that a \u00a7 2255 motion is inadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his detention. Rice argues that the new statutory interpretation set forth in <em>United States v. Gonzalez, </em>420 F.3d 111 (2d Cir.2005), entitles him to habeas corpus relief. Rice acknowledges that this latest claim does not meet the gatekeeping requirements for filing a second or successive \u00a7 2255 motion. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(h). We have specifically rejected the argument that a \u00a7 2255 motion is \u201cinadequate or ineffective\u201d simply because a petitioner is unable to meet the stringent gatekeeping requirements for filing a second or successive petition. <em>See Okereke v. United States, </em>307 F.3d 117, 120 (3d Cir.2002). Rice does not offer any other arguments addressing why \u00a7 2255 would be inadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his detention. Further, Rice is not alleging, as the petitioner in <em>Dorsainvil </em>did, that a statutory interpretation has rendered the crime for which he was convicted not criminal. Accordingly, a \u00a7 2241 petition is not the proper avenue for Rice to challenge his sentence. <em>Id. </em>at 120-21 (change in statutory interpretation affect<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>ing only sentencing does not permit a petition under \u00a7 2241).</p>\n<p id=\"b257-5\">In sum, because Rice\u2019s appeal lacks arguable legal merit, we will dismiss it pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(i).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
