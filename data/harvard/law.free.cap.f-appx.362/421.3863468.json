Pena-Sandoval argues for the first time on appeal that our opinion in <em>United States v. Rojas-Luna, </em>522 F.3d 502, 504-06 (5th Cir.2008), compels us to vacate his sentence. In <em>Rojas-Luna, </em>we held that the district court\u2019s use of the fact of the date of Rojas-Luna\u2019s 2006 removal to increase his sentence beyond the statutory maximum sentence allowed under \u00a7 1326(a) was reversible plain error because the fact of his 2006 removal had not been admitted by Rojas-Luna or proven to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Rojas-Luna, </em>522 F.3d at 506-07. We determined that the only evidence in the record to show when the defendant was removed was an unsupported statement in the presentence report (PSR) and that there was no evidence in the record that the defendant had agreed to the accuracy of this fact in the PSR. <em>Id. </em>at 507.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-24\">The facts in Pena-Sandoval\u2019s case are distinguishable. Pena-Sandoval pleaded guilty to the indictment that specifically alleged that he was deported in March 2004. The removal occurred after Pena-Sandoval\u2019s 1995 guilty plea to possession with intent to distribute and distribution in excess of five kilograms of cocaine. The district court properly relied on the 2004 removal to enhance Pena-Sandoval\u2019s sen-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>tenee. The district court did not plainly err. <em>See Puckett v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, -, 129 S.Ct. 1428, 1429, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b448-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b447-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
