(\u201cSunshine\u201d), a Florida fruit, vegetable, and diary distributor, and Marcos Serpa appeal the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment upholding the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services\u2019s (\u201cUSCIS\u201d) denial of a visa for Serpa, a Brazilian citizen, on the grounds that Ser-pa did not qualify as a multinational executive or manager under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1153(b)(1)(C). On appeal, they argue that (a) the district court erred in granting summary judgment because USCIS\u2019s denial was arbitrary and capricious under the Administrative Procedures Act (\u201cAPA\u201d), 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(2)(A), and (b) the district court erred in striking their demand for a jury trial on the grounds that the complaint had sought relief under the Declaratory Judgment Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2201.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-15\">I. Agency Decision</p>\n<p id=\"b28-16\">We review a district court\u2019s order of summary judgment <em>de novo. Preserve Endangered Areas of Cobb\u2019s History, Inc. v. U.S. Army Corps of Eng\u2019rs, </em>87 F.3d 1242, 1246 (11th Cir.1996). \u201cSummary judgment is proper if the pleadings, depositions, and affidavits show that there is no genuine issue of material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cThe evidence must be viewed in the light most favorable to the non-moving party.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cHowever, even in the context of summary judgment, an agency action is entitled to great deference.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cUnder the Administrative Procedure Act, a court shall set aside an action of an administrative agency where it is arbitrary, capricious, or an abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Id.-, </em>5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(2)(A) (stating that the reviewing court shall hold an agency\u2019s action, findings, or conclusions unlawful if they are arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law). Under the arbitrary and capricious standard, we must consider whether an agency\u2019s decision <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"3\">*3</page-number>\u201cwas based on a consideration of the relevant factors and whether there has been a clear error of judgment.\u201d <em>Sierra Club v. Johnson, </em>436 F.3d 1269, 1273-74 (11th Cir.2006) (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b29-5\">The focal point for judicial review of an administrative agency\u2019s action is the administrative record. <em>Presence, </em>87 F.3d at 1246. The reviewing court does not \u201cconduct its own investigation and substitute its own judgment for the administrative agency\u2019s decision.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Instead, the court is \u201cto decide, on the basis of the record the agency provides, whether the action passes muster under the appropriate APA standard of review.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b29-6\">Pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1153, certain employment-based immigrants are given first priority for visa preferences. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1153(b)(1). Preference is given to an alien who, in the three years preceding the alien\u2019s application for classification and admission into the United States, has been employed for at least one year by a corporation and seeks to enter the United States in order to continue to render services to the same employer or to a subsidiary in a \u201ccapacity that is managerial or executive.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1153(b)(1)(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b29-7\">The term \u201cmanagerial capacity\u201d means an assignment within the organization in which the employee primarily:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b29-8\">(i) manages the organization, or a department, subdivision, function, or component of the organization;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b29-9\">(ii) superases and controls the work of other supervisory, professional, or managerial employees, or manages an essential function within the organization, or a department or subdivision of the organization;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b29-10\">(iii) if another employee or other employees are directly supervised, has the authority to hire and fire or recommend those as well as other personnel actions (such as promotion and leave authoriza-</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b29-11\">tion) or, if no other employee is directly supervised, functions at a senior level within the organizational hierarchy or with respect to the function managed; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b29-12\">(iv)exercises discretion over the day-today operations of the activity or function for which the employee has authority. A first-line supervisor is not considered to be acting in a managerial capacity merely by virtue of the supervisor\u2019s supervisory duties unless the employees supervised are professional.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b29-13\">8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(44)(A). The term \u201cexecutive capacity\u201d means an assignment within the organization in which the employee primarily:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b29-14\">(i) directs the management of the organization or a major component or function of the organization;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b29-15\">(ii) establishes the goals and policies of the organization, component, or function;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b29-16\">(iii) exercises wide latitude in discretionary decision-making; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b29-17\">(iv) receives only general supervision or direction from higher level executives, the board of directors, or stockholders of the organization.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b29-18\"><em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 1101(a)(44)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b29-19\">If the agency uses staffing levels as a factor to determine whether an individual is acting in a managerial or executive capacity, the agency \u201cshall take into account the reasonable needs of the organization, component, or function in light of the overall purpose and stage of development of the organization, component, or function.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 1101(a)(44)(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b29-20\">In this case, the district court did not err in granting summary judgment in favor of USCIS because the agency\u2019s visa denial was neither arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, nor otherwise not in accordance with law. We disagree with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>Sunshine and Serpa that USCIS used Sunshine\u2019s small size as the only criterion to justify its denial of Serpa\u2019s visa petition. USCIS considered the job descriptions and organizational charts provided by Sunshine to evaluate the activities of Sunshine\u2019s three employees. Based on those descriptions, USCIS found that the majority of Serpa\u2019s time could not be spent acting in an executive or managerial capacity because Serpa had to fulfill all of the non-managerial and non-executive tasks associated with the financial, sales, technology, and legal departments, because there were no other employees in the organization working in those departments. The other two employees spent all of their time loading trucks, arranging the trucks at the warehouse, making deliveries, cleaning the trucks, checking for truck maintenance, maintaining the freshness of the merchandise, cleaning the warehouse, and helping other drivers. Therefore, USCIS considered the structure of the organization, the size of the organization, and the needs of the organization before denying the visa petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-4\">Moreover, because the district court\u2019s review was limited to the administrative record, the district court properly excluded evidence developed outside of the administrative record, including Serpa\u2019s second unsworn declaration and request for admissions. <em>See Preserve, </em>87 F.3d at 1246. Additionally, USCIS did consider Serpa\u2019s first unsworn declaration submitted during Sunshine and Serpa\u2019s second motion to reopen and reconsider, but found that the unsworn declaration did not establish new facts to warrant a reopening. Because Sunshine and Serpa did not challenge USCIS\u2019s denial of his motion to reopen, only the motion to reconsider, they have abandoned any argument related to the motion to reopen. <em>See Access Now, Inc. v. Southwest Airlines Co., </em>385 F.3d 1324, 1330 (11th Cir.2004) (an argument not fully briefed or presented at all is abandoned on appeal). Nor did the district court consider Serpa\u2019s foreign entity job duties during summary judgment. Thus, Sunshine and Serpa\u2019s argument that it did so fails. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-6\">II. Jury Demand</p>\n<p id=\"b30-7\">We review <em>de novo </em>the legal question of whether the district court erred in striking Sunshine and Serpa\u2019s jury demand. <em>St. Paul Fire &amp; Marine Ins. Co. v. Lago Canyon, Inc., </em>561 F.3d 1181, 1186 n. 10 (11th Cir.2009). The Declaratory Judgment Act states that in a case of actual controversy a court \u201cmay declare the rights and other legal relations of any interested party seeking such declaration, whether or not further relief is or could be sought.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2201(a). The Declaratory Judgment Act thus \u201cpreserves the right to jury trial for both parties,\u201d but does not create a right to a jury trial. <em>See Beacon Theatres, Inc. v. Westover, </em>359 U.S. 500, 504, 79 S.Ct. 948, 3 L.Ed.2d 988 (1959) (holding that \u201cif Beacon would have been entitled to a jury trial in a treble damage suit against Fox it cannot be deprived of that right merely because Fox took advantage of the availability of declaratory relief to sue Beacon first\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b30-8\">As we have noted, the focal point in an action for judicial review of an administrative agency\u2019s decision is the administrative record. <em>Preserve, </em>87 F.3d at 1246. The reviewing court is not empowered to conduct a <em>de novo </em>inquiry into the fact of the matter being reviewed or to reach its own conclusions based on such an inquiry. <em>Id. </em>In this case, Sunshine and Serpa had no right to a jury trial in their suit for judicial review over an agency action simply because they sought relief under the Declaratory Judgment Act. Therefore, the dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>trict court did not err in striking their demand for a jury trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
