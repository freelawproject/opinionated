INA \u00a7 241(b)(3), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(c). The Board of Immigration Appeals and the immigration judge denied Calmo\u2019s application for asylum as untimely and found that Calmo failed to establish he was eligible for withholding of removal or relief under the Convention. We deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-19\">Calmo challenges only one of the three decisions of the Board. Calmo challenges the denial of withholding of removal. Cal-mo does not challenge the denial of relief under the Convention. Calmo also does not contest the finding that his application for asylum was untimely, which we lack jurisdiction to review. <em>Mendoza v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>327 F.3d 1283, 1287 (11th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b81-20\">The record does not compel a finding that Calmo suffered past persecution on account of a protected ground. Calmo alleged that other members of his family suffered persecution, and Calmo failed to establish that their alleged persecution occurred on account of a protected ground. Calmo testified that guerillas kidnapped his brother, Luis, because Calmo\u2019s father was a member of the civil patrol, but Cal-mo later testified that no one had claimed responsibility for the kidnapping and he had assumed guerillas had been responsible because the incident occurred \u201cduring the guerrillas\u2019 time.\u201d Calmo testified that his parents had been beaten and his family had received four notes threatening the disappearance of the \u201cnext one,\u201d but the incidents occurred after Calmo\u2019s father left <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>the civil patrol and Calmo could not identify the individuals that had been involved. <em>See Silva v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>448 F.3d 1229, 1238 (11th Cir.2006). Calmo also testified about threatening phone calls that he had received, but the calls were made anonymously and do not rise to the level of persecution. <em>See Sepulveda v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1226, 1231 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b82-4\">The record also does not compel a finding that Calmo has a well-founded fear of persecution on a protected ground upon return to Guatemala. Despite the incidents involving his brother and parents, neither Calmo nor his younger siblings were harmed. Calmo\u2019s father has retired from civil service, and Calmo has not been threatened for any personal activity adverse to the guerillas. Calmo testified that his family has remained in their hometown without incident. <em>See Ruiz v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>440 F.3d 1247, 1259 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b82-5\">Calmo now argues that the persecution was attributable to his Mayan ancestry, but he failed to present that argument to either the immigration judge or the Board. \u201c[T]he rules are clear: before proceeding to federal court, an alien must exhaust his or her administrative remedies.\u201d <em>Amayar-Artunduaga v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>463 F.3d 1247, 1250 (11th Cir.2006) (quoting <em>Sundar v. INS, </em>328 F.3d 1320, 1323 (11th Cir.2003)). The Board did not err when it dismissed Calmo\u2019s petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-6\">We DENY Calmo\u2019s petition for review.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
