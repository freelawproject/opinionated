After review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b986-6\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b986-7\">This is Harrison\u2019s second appeal of his sentence. To place the present appeal in context, we outline the offense conduct, the original sentencing, the first appeal and Harrison\u2019s resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b986-8\">A. Offense Conduct</p>\n<p id=\"b986-9\">Harrison\u2019s firearm offenses involved two separate incidents. On July 4, 2007, a police officer saw a parked truck with smoke and burning fireworks around it. When the truck drove away, the officer pursued and eventually stopped the truck. The officer discovered that Harrison, the driver, had a suspended license and was a habitual traffic violator. When a second officer found a short-barrel shotgun in the bed of the truck, Harrison fled on foot and was not recaptured.</p>\n<p id=\"b986-10\">On July 22, 2007, a police officer observed a red sports car run a stop sign and attempted a traffic stop. When the red sports car did not stop, the officer pursued with lights and sirens activated. The red sports car exceeded 80 miles an hour and ran two stop signs to elude police until the chase was called off.</p>\n<p id=\"b986-11\">Later, officers found the red sports car parked at a residence. Police went to the home of the registered owner, Crystal Hall. Hall is the mother of one of Harrison\u2019s children, and Harrison resided across the street from Hall. After Hall consented to a search of her home, officers found Harrison hiding in a closet. During a subsequent interview, Hall told officers that she had seen Harrison in possession of at least four different firearms, including the above short-barrel shotgun.</p>\n<p id=\"b986-13\">B. Guilty Plea and Original Sentencing</p>\n<p id=\"b986-14\">Harrison pled guilty to both firearm counts in the indictment. The Presen-tence Investigation Report (\u201cPSI\u201d) calculated a base offense level of 22, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(3), based on Harrison\u2019s possession of a short-barrel shotgun and one prior felony conviction for either a crime of violence or a controlled substance offense. The PSI recommended a 2 level increase, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(l)(A), based on Harrison\u2019s possession of three to seven firearms, and a 3 level reduction, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1, for Harrison\u2019s acceptance of responsibility, resulting in a total offense level of 21.</p>\n<p id=\"b986-15\">The PSI calculated 17 criminal history points based on eight of Harrison\u2019s prior convictions and 2 additional points for committing the instant offenses within two years of his release from custody, which resulted in a criminal history category of VI. Harrison\u2019s total offense level of 21 and criminal history category of VI yielded an advisory guidelines range of 77 to 96 months\u2019 imprisonment. The PSI advised that an upward departure under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.3(a)(1) for an underrepresented criminal history might be warranted because: (1) Harrison had a lengthy criminal history beginning at age 9, (2) Harrison was only 25 years old at the time of sentencing, (3) a number of Harrison\u2019s convictions and arrests were not counted toward his 19 criminal history points, and (4) Harrison\u2019s 19 points put him well above the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"961\">*961</page-number>required 13 for a criminal history category VI.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b987-5\">Harrison did not object to the PSI\u2019s recommended guidelines calculations, but the government did. The government argued that Harrison qualified as an armed career criminal under the Armed Career Criminal Act (\u201cACCA\u201d), 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e) and the corresponding armed career criminal guideline, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.4, based on three of Harrison\u2019s prior felony convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b987-6\">The district court agreed with the government and sentenced Harrison as an armed career criminal with an offense level of 30, pursuant to \u00a7 4B1.4(b)(3)(B), and a criminal history category of VI. Given the ACCA\u2019s mandatory-minimum fifteen-year sentence, Harrison\u2019s resulting advisory guidelines range was 180 to 210 months. The district court imposed a 210-month sentence on Count One and a concurrent 120-month sentence on Count Two.</p>\n<p id=\"b987-7\">The district court filed a written Statement of Reasons, noting that the sentences were within the advisory guidelines range. Accordingly, the court left unfilled Section V, titled \u201cdepartures authorized by the advisory sentencing guidelines,\u201d and Section VI, titled \u201ccourt determination for sentence outside the advisory guideline system.\u201d The district court explained that, after considering Harrison\u2019s \u201clengthy criminal convictions,\u201d a total sentence at the high end of the range was warranted to \u201cprotect the public from further crimes of the defendant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b987-14\">C. First Appeal and Remand</p>\n<p id=\"b987-15\">Harrison appealed, arguing that one of his prior convictions used for his armed-career-criminal status \u2014 a Florida conviction for fleeing or attempting to elude police under Florida Statute \u00a7 316.1935(2) \u2014 did not qualify as a \u201cviolent felony\u201d under the ACCA and \u00a7 4B1.4. This Court agreed, vacated Harrison\u2019s sentences and remanded \u201cfor resentencing without the ACCA\u2019s increased penalties.\u201d <em>United States v. Harrison, </em>558 F.3d 1280, 1301 (11th Cir.2009) <em>(Harrison I) </em>(concluding that a Fla. Stat. \u00a7 316.1935(2) conviction is not a violent felony under the ACCA because it does not involve fleeing or eluding at \u201chigh speed\u201d or with \u201cwanton disregard for the safety of persons or property,\u201d in contrast to Fla. Stat. 316.1935(3), which does).</p>\n<p id=\"b987-16\">D. Resentencing</p>\n<p id=\"b987-17\">On remand, the probation officer prepared (1) a supplemental addendum stating that the original PSI was correct and the district court could rely upon it, and (2) an alternate sentencing recommendation, which stated that, although the advisory guidelines range was 77 to 96 months\u2019 imprisonment, the probation officer recommended a 120-month sentence on Count One and a consecutive 90-month sentence on Count Two, for a total 210-month sentence.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b988-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"962\">*962</page-number>Likewise, the government filed a sentencing memorandum that acknowledged the advisory guidelines range of 77 to 96 months, but requested a total 210-month sentence. The government submitted that these circumstances supported a 210-month sentence: (1) Harrison, who was 25 at the time of conviction, had 19 criminal history points, 6 more than needed for a criminal history category of VI; (2) Harrison committed all of the crimes accounting for his 19 criminal history points in less than five years, between 2002 and 2006, with the instant offenses occurring just two months after his last release from prison; and (3) numerous other convictions, including six felonies and four misdemeanors, before 2002 were not counted toward the 19 criminal history points. The government argued that, under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), these circumstances warranted a 210-month sentence to protect the public from further crimes by Harrison.</p>\n<p id=\"b988-4\">During the sentencing hearing, no party objected to the PSI\u2019s calculation of the advisory guidelines range of 77 to 96 months\u2019 imprisonment. However, Harrison vigorously opposed a 210-month sentence, either as an upward departure pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.3 for an underrepresented criminal history or as a <em>Booker-type </em>variance from the advisory guidelines range. Harrison addressed each of his uncounted prior convictions and argued that they either occurred when he was a juvenile, did not involve possession of weapons, or involved only a small amount of drugs. And Harrison contended that the court should not consider his arrests that did not result in convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b988-5\">The district court imposed a 210-month sentence, consisting of a 120-month sentence on Count One and a consecutive 90-month sentence on Count Two. The district court in essence explained that the 210-month sentence was not due to a guidelines departure based on under-represented criminal history, but was an \u201cupward variance\u201d based on the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, such as the nature and circumstances of Harrison\u2019s offenses, the history and characteristics of Harrison and in order to protect the public from further crimes, to reflect the seriousness of the offenses, to promote respect for the law and to provide just punishment, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b988-9\">The sentence imposed in Count 1 is the statutory maximum allowed by law. And I recognize there are grounds for departure from the advisory guideline range based upon the criminal history category which substantially under-represents the seriousness, extent and nature of your criminal history and the likelihood that you will commit further crimes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b988-10\">And while this reason alone, perhaps, is not substantial enough to support the departure necessary to afford adequate punishment or deterrence in this case, I have also considered the factors set out in [18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) ], as well as the advisory guidelines.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b988-11\">... I determine that due to the nature and circumstances of the offense, the history and characteristics of [Harrison], that an upward variance is warranted in this case in order to protect the public from further crimes by [Harrison], to reflect the seriousness of the offense, to promote respect for the law, and provide just punishment for the offense.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b988-12\">As I did in the previous sentence, I do determine that the sentence is reasonable, and I find that the sentence is sufficient, and I hope that a greater sentence should not be necessary. I <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"963\">*963</page-number>also find that this sentence meets the general goals of punishment and hopefully will act as a deterrent to anyone else who might consider similar criminal conduct.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b989-5\">In addressing the \u00a7 3553(a) factors,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the district court expressly assessed the seriousness of Harrison\u2019s current offenses and his criminal history and concluded that Harrison had \u201ca consistent pattern of aggressive, noncompliant behavior demonstrating [his] lack of respect for the law.\u201d In this regard, the district court pointed out that Harrison\u2019s current offenses involved him fleeing from police at high speeds in excess of 80 miles per hour in residential areas and illegally possessing an unregistered 16-gauge, short-barrel shotgun, that he had numerous prior convictions for fleeing from and eluding police, and that his prior periods of supervision were unsuccessful. The district court also observed that thirteen of Harrison\u2019s prior adult convictions resulted in jail terms, which indicated to the court that Harrison was not motivated to change his lifestyle in any way. The district court found that Harrison \u201cpose[d] a physical danger to the community at large based on the facts of this case as well as [his] lifetime continuing pattern of criminal activity.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"A6B\">As noted above, the district court concluded \u201cdue to the nature and circumstances of the offense, the history and characteristics of [Harrison], that an upward variance is warranted in this case in order to protect the public from further crimes by [Harrison], to reflect the seriousness of the offense, to promote respect for the law, and provide just punishment for the offense,\u201d but that a 210-month sentence was sufficient, met the goal of punishment and deterrence, and was not greater than necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b989-10\">Afterward, the district court filed an Amended Statement of Reasons. The district court checked the box under Section IV indicating that the sentence was outside the advisory guidelines range, left blank Section V, titled \u201cdepartures authorized by the advisory sentencing guidelines,\u201d and filled out Section VI that was titled \u201ccourt determination of sentence outside the advisory guideline system,\u201d reiterating its explanation of the sentence. Harrison filed this appeal challenging his 210-month sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b989-11\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"AtK\">A. Mandate Rule</p>\n<p id=\"b989-12\">On appeal, Harrison argues for the first time that the district court violated our mandate in <em>Harrison I </em>to resentence him without the ACCA\u2019s penalties.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b990-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"964\">*964</page-number>Upon remand, the district court properly followed our appellate mandate. The fact that the district court ultimately imposed the same total 210-month sentence does not mean the district court re-applied the ACCA or \u00a7 4B1.4, its corresponding guideline. Rather the district court arrived at the 210-month total sentence by calculating the advisory guidelines range without reference to the ACCA or \u00a7 4B1.4. Then the district court imposed an \u201cupward variance\u201d from the advisory guidelines range based on several of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, including the seriousness of Harrison\u2019s offenses, Harrison\u2019s characteristics and extensive, continuing criminal history, the fact that his past thirteen jail sentences as an adult appeared not to have deterred Harrison\u2019s life of crime, and the need to protect the public from Harrison as a dangerous recidivist.</p>\n<p id=\"b990-4\">Harrison\u2019s reliance on <em>Amedeo </em>is misplaced. In <em>Amedeo, </em>this Court vacated several upward departures under the guidelines because the conduct used to support them was not relevant conduct. <em>United States v. Amedeo, </em>370 F.3d 1305, 1321-25 (11th Cir.2004) <em>(Amedeo I); see also Amedeo, </em>487 F.3d at 827 <em>(Amedeo </em>II). We remanded to \u201crecalculate the sentence in accord with [our] opinion.\u201d <em>Ame-deo I, </em>370 F.3d at 1325. On remand, the district court relied on the same facts it had used to support the reversed departures to vary the sentence upward using the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>Amedeo II, </em>487 F.3d at 829-30. In the second appeal, we affirmed, explaining that the district court did not violate our mandate by imposing an upward variance based on the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, as opposed to a guidelines departure. <em>Id. </em>at 830.</p>\n<p id=\"b990-10\">Here, the district court did not on remand impose a guidelines-based upward departure at all or impose an upward variance on grounds this Court had concluded were impermissible.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Instead, the district court imposed an upward variance based on the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, including the seriousness of Harrison\u2019s offenses, his characteristic of being unwilling to change his lifestyle and the overall pattern of Harrison\u2019s continuing criminal activity despite repeated jail sentences, which suggested that Harrison was a dangerous recidivist from whom the public needed to be protected. Our holding in <em>Harrison I </em>merely precluded the district court from re-apply<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"965\">*965</page-number>ing the armed career criminal enhancements. It did not prevent the district court from considering Harrison\u2019s dangerousness reflected in the high-speed chase surrounding his current firearm offenses or his past criminal convictions, including his 2007 Florida conviction for fleeing or attempting to elude police, in deciding whether to impose an upward variance based on the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. Thus, the district court did not commit error, much less plain error, in basing its upward variance in part on these facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b991-5\">B. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(g)(2)</p>\n<p id=\"b991-6\">For the first time on appeal, Harrison argues that 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(g)(2) prohibited the district court from imposing on remand a sentence outside the newly calculated guidelines range. Section 3742(g)(2) provides that, after remand, a district com\u00ed; shall resentence a defendant in accordance with \u00a7 3553 and the appellate court\u2019s instructions, but \u201cshall not impose a sentence outside the applicable guidelines range except\u201d on a ground that was: (1) \u201cspecifically and affirmatively included in the written statement of reasons required by section 3553(e) in connection with the previous sentencing,\u201d and (b) \u201cheld by the court of appeals\u201d to be a \u201cpermissible ground of departure\u201d on remand. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(g)(2)(A)-(B).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The purpose of \u00a7 3742(g)(2) is to prevent district courts from imposing the same illegal departure on a different theory on remand. <em>See </em>H.R. Conf. Rep. No. 108-66 at 59 (2003) <em>reprinted in </em>2003 U.S.C.A.A.N. 683, 694.</p>\n<p id=\"b991-11\">This provision was enacted in 2003, two years before <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). <em>See </em>Prosecutorial Remedies and Other Tools to End the Exploitation of Children Today Act of 2003 (\u201cPROTECT Act\u201d), Pub.L. No. 108-21, Title IV, \u00a7 401, 117 Stat. 650, 671. Thus, this provision was enacted at a time when the guidelines range was mandatory and a district court could go outside that mandatory range only when specific guidelines requirements were met to warrant a guidelines-based <em>\u201cdeparture.\u201d </em>However, <em>Booker </em>made the guidelines range advisory and authorized \u201cvariances\u201d outside the range based on the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>See Booker, </em>543 U.S. at 258-60, 125 S.Ct. at 764-65.</p>\n<p id=\"b991-12\">Neither this Court nor the Supreme Court has addressed whether \u00a7 3742(g)(2) even applies to <em>post-Booker </em>variances in addition to guidelines departures. Further, in remanding cases for resentencing after <em>Booker, </em>both this Court and the Supreme Court have instructed district courts, without reference to \u00a7 3742(g)(2), to treat the sentencing guidelines range as advisory. <em>See, e.g., Kimbrough v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 85, 90-91, 128 S.Ct. 558, 564, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007) (applying <em>Booker </em>and reversing Fourth Circuit\u2019s remand instructing the district court to treat as mandatory the guidelines\u2019 crack cocaine 100:1 sentencing ratio); <em>United States v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"966\">*966</page-number><em>Shelton, </em>400 F.3d 1325, 1330, 1334 (11th Cir.2005) (remanding for resentencing under post-Boo/cer advisory guidelines). Therefore, at the very minimum, any alleged error under \u00a7 3742(g)(2) could not be plain. <em>See United States v. Castro, </em>455 F.3d 1249, 1253 (11th Cir.2006) (explaining that an error cannot be plain unless it is clear under current law). Given that the district court made an upward variance based on \u00a7 3553(a) in an advisory system, and not a guidelines-based departure, Harrison has not shown reversible error under \u00a7 3742(g)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b992-4\">C. Reasonableness</p>\n<p id=\"b992-5\">Harrison argues that the district court\u2019s upward variance is procedurally and substantively unreasonable. We review the reasonableness of a sentence for abuse of discretion using a two-step process. <em>United States v. Pugh, </em>515 F.3d 1179, 1190 (11th Cir.2008). We look first at whether the district court committed any significant procedural error and then at whether the sentence is substantively reasonable under the totality of the circumstances. <em>Id. </em>The party challenging the sentence bears the burden to show it is unreasonable in light of the record and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>United States v. Thomas, </em>446 F.3d 1348, 1351 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b992-6\">\u201cIf, after correctly calculating the guidelines range, a district court decides that a sentence outside that range is appropriate, it must \u2018consider the extent of the deviation and ensure that the justification is sufficiently compelling to support the degree of the variance.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Williams, </em>526 F.3d 1312, 1322 (11th Cir.2008) (quoting <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 50, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007)). Likewise, although \u201c[sentences outside the guidelines are not presumed to be unreasonable, ... we may take the extent of any variance into our calculus.\u201d <em>United States v. Shaw, </em>560 F.3d 1230, 1237 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 129 S.Ct. 2847, 174 L.Ed.2d 566 (2009). However, we \u201cmust give due deference to the district court\u2019s decision that the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, on a whole, justify the extent of the variance.\u201d <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. at 597.</p>\n<p id=\"b992-8\">Here, the 210-month sentence represented a 114-month variance from the high end of the advisory guidelines range of 77 to 96 months\u2019 imprisonment. Harrison claims that the upward variance was procedurally unreasonable because the district court failed to adequately explain it. This argument is belied by the record. The district court supported the upward variance by discussing in detail several of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, including: (1) the seriousness of Harrison\u2019s offenses, which included leading police on a high-speed chase in excess of 80 miles per hour through residential areas; (2) Harrison\u2019s extensive criminal history, which included a \u201cpattern of aggressive, noncompliant behavior\u201d that the district court concluded demonstrated a \u201clack of respect for the law\u201d; (3) the fact that Harrison\u2019s thirteen past jail sentences had not had a deterrent effect; and (4) the danger Harrison posed to the public. The district court\u2019s explanation was adequate.</p>\n<p id=\"b992-9\">Harrison contends that the upward variance is substantively unreasonable because the district court unjustifiably relied solely on his criminal history and failed to consider mitigating factors, such as his strong family support. Again, the record does not support Harrison\u2019s argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b992-10\">Harrison\u2019s long criminal history was only one part of the district court\u2019s decision to impose the upward variance. The district court also relied on the dangerous nature of Harrison\u2019s high-speed fleeing on July 22, 2007, connected with the current two firearm offenses, which was part of a larger pattern of aggressive noncompliance with law enforcement, and the fact <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"967\">*967</page-number>that Harrison\u2019s past thirteen jail sentences had not deterred him in his life of crime. Based on these facts, the district court concluded that Harrison posed a serious risk of danger and that the variance was needed to protect the public, promote respect for the law, and deter Harrison from committing future crimes. <em>See Shaw, </em>560 F.3d at 1237 (the district court has the discretion to attach greater weight to some \u00a7 3553(a) factors over others). Under the totality of the circumstances, the district court was within its discretion to conclude that the mitigating factors Harrison points to were outweighed by the seriousness of the offenses and the need to protect the public, afford deterrence and promote respect for the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b993-5\">Furthermore, the district court heard Harrison\u2019s mitigation arguments and acknowledged Harrison\u2019s learning disability and limited education. Although the district court did not mention Harrison\u2019s supportive family, it was not required to address and analyze each mitigating factor on the record. <em>See Amedeo, </em>487 F.3d at 833 (stating the district court\u2019s failure to discuss mitigating evidence does not mean the court ignored it or failed to consider it). We also recognize that the degree of the variance is relevant to the substantive reasonableness of the sentence and in general \u201ca major departure should be supported by a more significant justification than a minor one.\u201d <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 50, 128 S.Ct. at 597. Here, a 210-month sentence is a major departure, but it is supported by a significant justification. <em>See Shaw, </em>560 F.3d at 1237 (affirming upward variance from 30 to 37 months\u2019 imprisonment to statutory maximum of 120 months\u2019 imprisonment as substantively reasonable where district court highlighted defendant\u2019s fifteen-year criminal career that involved resisting arrest and carrying firearms and stressing the district court methodically reviewed the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and among other things found shorter sentences in the past were ineffective to protect the public).</p>\n<p id=\"b993-7\">Finally, that some of these facts were also considered in calculating Harrison\u2019s advisory guidelines range does not make the sentence unreasonable. The district court must calculate the advisory guidelines range and then consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>See Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 38, 49-50, 128 S.Ct. at 586, 596-97. Nothing in \u00a7 3553(a) or our binding precedent suggests that the district court should ignore those \u00a7 3553(a) factors that have some overlap with the Sentencing Guidelines. <em>See Amedeo, </em>487 F.3d at 833 (rejecting argument that because conduct was considered in imposing guidelines enhancement, it could not be considered under the \u00a7 3553(a) factors in imposing an upward variance). In sum, we cannot say Harrison has carried his burden to establish that the district court\u2019s 210-month total sentence was an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b993-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b987-8\">.

Harrison\u2019s argument that the district court imposed a \u00a7 4A1.3 under-represented criminal history departure is not supported by the record. Instead, the district court imposed an upward variance after considering the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>See United States v. Irizar-ry, </em>458 F.3d 1208, 1211-12 (11th Cir.2006), <em>aff'd, Irizarry v. United States, </em>553 U.S. 708, 128 S.Ct. 2198, 171 L.Ed.2d 28 (2008) (explaining that district court's sentence above the guidelines range was the result of an upward variance and not an upward departure where the district court calculated the advisory guidelines range, considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and concluded that a sentence within the guidelines range did not adequately address the defendant's future dangerousness); <em>United States v. Eldick, </em>443 F.3d 783, 788 n. 2 (11th Cir.2006) (explaining that the imposition of an above-guidelines sentence was not an upward departure because the district court did not cite a specific departure guideline and instead stated that the guidelines do not adequately take into account the \u00a7 3553(a) factors). Because the district court imposed an upward variance, not a \u00a7 4A1.3 departure, the district court did not improperly depart under \u00a7 4A1.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b991-7\">.
