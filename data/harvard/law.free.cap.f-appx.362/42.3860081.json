Fernandez argues that she is entitled to relief because the Immigration Judge (\u201cIJ\u201d) and BIA violated Fernandez\u2019s due process rights when \u201cthey did not follow applicable regulations.\u201d After careful review, we deny her petition in part, and dismiss it in part.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b69-20\">We review the BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to reconsider for abuse of discretion. <em>Assa\u2019ad v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>332 F.3d 1321, 1341 (11th Cir.2003). Our review is limited to determining \u201cwhether there has been an exercise of administrative discretion and whether the matter of exercise has been arbitrary or capricious.\u201d <em>Abdi v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>430 F.3d 1148, 1149 (11th Cir.2005) (quotation omitted). A motion for reconsideration \u201cshall specify the er<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>rors of law or fact in the previous order and shall be supported by pertinent authority.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(6)(C); <em>see also </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(b)(1). Further, \u201cwe are divested of jurisdiction to consider a claim that was not presented to the immigration courts, as an alien must exhaust the administrative remedies available to [her] prior to obtaining judicial review.\u201d <em>Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1285 n. 14 (11th Cir.2001) (internal quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b70-4\">First, we are unpersuaded that Fernandez is entitled to relief based on her argument, raised before the BIA in her motion to reconsider, that the IJ erred by finding that, because she was married to a Mexican national, Mexico constituted a third safe country. Indeed, the BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying her motion to reconsider based on this argument because it does not relate to any alleged mistake of law or fact that the BIA made in denying her motion to reopen. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(e)(6)(C); <em>see also </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(b)(1). Rather, her motion to reopen focused on the facts that her husband was currently pursuing cancellation of removal, that she would derive immigration benefits if he obtained relief, and that her United States citizen daughter would suffer extreme hardship if Fernandez was removed to Colombia. Thus, the BIA correctly determined that the argument in her motion to reconsider regarding a safe third country did not relate to any alleged error that the BIA made in denying her motion to reopen. Accordingly, we deny Fernandez\u2019s petition based on this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-5\">Fernandez\u2019s remaining arguments\u2014that her due process rights were violated because she was denied a full and fair asylum hearing, that she was \u201cforced\u201d to request voluntary departure, and that her deportation order resulted in a \u201cgross miscarriage of justice\u201d\u2014were not presented to the BIA in her motion to reconsider. Therefore, she did not exhaust her administrative remedies with regard to these claims and we are divested of jurisdiction to consider them. <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1285 n. 14. Accordingly, we dismiss Fernandez\u2019s appeal regarding these claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-7\">Finally, Fernandez has abandoned any other arguments relating to the BIA\u2019s denial of her motion to reconsider because she failed to raise them on appeal. <em>Sepulveda v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1226, 1228 n. 2 (11th Cir.2005) (concluding a petitioner abandoned his issue by failing to raise it in his opening brief). Therefore, we deny Fernandez\u2019s petition in part, and dismiss it in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-8\">PETITION DENIED in part, DISMISSED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b69-13\">. We note that only the BIA\u2019s order denying Fernandez\u2019s motion to reconsider is before us because Fernandez did not petition us to review the BIA\u2019s other decisions, and she is now precluded from raising any claims related to those decisions. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(1) (providing that an alien has 30 days to file a petition for review); <em>Dakane v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>371 F.3d 771, 773 n. 3 (11th Cir.2004) (holding that the statutory time limit for filing a petition for review is \"mandatory and jurisdictional\u201d and, therefore, not subject to equitable lolling).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
