The following factual and procedural history is relevant to our consideration of the issues advanced on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-13\">On July 31,1998, defendant went to the Plainfield police department to complain about his vehicle being towed. He was directed to the Traffic Violations Bureau where he got into an argument with the desk officer. Lt. Mark Edwards (Edwards), the shift commander on duty that day, heard \u201csome sort of a verbal disturbance going on out at the front desk\u201d and went to investigate. Edwards encountered defendant, who was upset and angry. Defendant argued with Edwards until defendant was told to leave the building.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-14\">Edwards had a previous encounter with defendant in January 1998, during which Edwards learned that defendant\u2019s New Jersey driving privileges had been suspended. In July, when Edwards saw defendant leave the police station, get into a vehicle, and drive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>off, Edwards broadcast on <em>the </em>police radio a description of the vehicle, the direction in which he was headed, and his belief that the driver was driving with a suspended license. Edwards directed Detective Jorge Jimenez, who was in an unmarked police car equipped with lights and siren, to stop defendant. Meanwhile, Officer Israel Valentin was in a marked police car and joined in pursuit of defendant. Lights and sirens were activated in both the marked and unmarked police vehicles. Nevertheless, defendant failed to stop and continued in a thirty-to-forty-mile-per-hour chase through a residential area, ignoring stop signs, and traveling in the opposing lane of traffic. Defendant was ultimately stopped in front of his home, arrested, and charged with eluding and resisting arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-5\">On October 29, 1998, defendant was indicted and charged with second-degree attempted eluding under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:29-2 and fourth-degree resisting arrest under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:29-2. Prior to the commencement of trial, the resisting arrest charge was reduced to a disorderly persons offense. Defendant\u2019s first trial ended in a mistrial. His second trial was held on August 29 and 30, 2000. At trial, defendant attempted to cross-examine Edwards on the incident that occurred in January 1998, when Edwards had dealings with defendant regarding his license. The trial judge did not permit that, ruling that it was not relevant evidence. Defense counsel argued that the testimony would demonstrate animosity between Edwards and defendant and that Edwards had a \u201cmotive for lying.\u201d The trial judge ruled that Edwards was not a witness to the eluding and, therefore, the testimony was not relevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-6\">The jury convicted defendant of the lesser-included offense of third-degree eluding. On January 5, 2001, defendant was sentenced to one year of probation with sixty days on the Sheriffs Labor Assistance Program, along with various fines and penalties.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-7\">Defendant appealed his conviction. On appeal, defendant\u2019s appellate counsel raised two points. The first was that the trial court violated defendant\u2019s constitutional rights to due process and to present a defense when it prohibited him from cross-examining <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>Edwards about their prior encounter. The second point raised was that defendant\u2019s sentence was manifestly excessive. On June 19, 2002, our court, in a written decision, denied defendant\u2019s appeal. The Supreme Court denied certification on July 21, 2003. <em>State v. Gaither, </em>177 <em>N.J. </em>496, 828 A.2d 923 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b542-5\">Sometime before April 25, 2003, defendant visited his appellate counsel to inquire about the status of his appeal. Defendant\u2019s appellate counsel then learned that his earlier attempts to contact defendant had been unsuccessful because his office had used the wrong address, despite the correct address being handwritten on the pre-sentence report in the file. On April 25, 2003, appellate counsel wrote a letter to the trial judge documenting appellate counsel\u2019s error and acknowledging \u201cthat I was careless in not noticing the corrected address and thereby caused [defendant] not to have contact with his appellate attorney.\u201d On September 16, 2003, defendant filed his petition for PCR. The trial judge conducted a hearing on December 20, 2005. At the hearing, defendant\u2019s sole basis for relief was ineffective assistance of appellate counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-6\">The trial court applied the \u201cStricklandr-Preciose\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> standards. The court found that even if appellate counsel\u2019s failure to communicate fell below the objective standards of reasonableness, defendant did not demonstrate a reasonable probability that but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the results of the appeal would have been different. The trial judge declined to extend the holding in <em>State v. Rue, </em>175 <em>N.J. </em>1, 811 A.2d 425 (2002), to appellate counsel. In <em>Rue, </em>the Supreme Court held that an attorney representing a defendant in a PCR petition is required to communicate with his client and investigate the client\u2019s claims. <em>Id. </em>at 18, 811 A.2d 425. This appeal ensued.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-7\">On appeal, defendant presents the following argument for our consideration:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b542-8\">\n<em>POINT i</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b543-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>DEFENDANT\u2019S RIGHTS TO A DIRECT APPEAL, DUE PROCESS, FUNDAMENTAL FAIRNESS, EQUAL PROTECTION, APPELLATE COUNSEL AND EFFECTIVE ASSISTANCE OF APPELLATE COUNSEL WERE DENIED BY HIS LACK OF OPPORTUNITY TO CONSULT WITH COUNSEL AND CONTRIBUTE TO OR PARTICIPATE IN HIS APPEAL.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b543-9\">Defendant argues that his appellate counsel\u2019s failure to communicate with his client violates the <em>\u201cStncklandr-Preciose\u201d </em>ineffective assistance of counsel standards and the holding in <em>Rue </em>regarding an attorney\u2019s duty to communicate with his client. We will address the <em>\u201cStricklandr-Preciose\u201d </em>argument first and then the applicability of <em>Rue.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b543-10\">Preliminarily, we note that we have previously held that the Law Division should, in the first instance, hear PCR petitions raising claims of ineffective appellate counsel. <em>State v. Calloway, </em>275 <em>N.J.Super. </em>13, 15, 645 A.2d 150 (App.Div.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b543-11\">In <em>State v. Morrison, </em>215 <em>N.J.Super. </em>540, 546, 522 A.2d 473 (App.Div.1987), we applied to claims of ineffective assistance of appellate counsel the standard for assessing ineffective assistance of trial counsel claims established in <em>Strickland </em>and adopted by the New Jersey Supreme Court in <em>State v. Fritz, </em>105 <em>N.J. </em>42, 519 A.2d 336 (1987). In <em>Morrison, </em>we found that \u201cin applying the <em>Strickland </em>standard to assess a claim of ineffective assistance of appellate counsel, defendant must show not only that his attorney\u2019s representation fell below an objective standard, but also that he was prejudiced, i.e., but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result would have been different.\u201d <em>Morrison, supra, </em>215 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 546, 522 A.2d 473.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-12\">Defendant argues that his appellate counsel\u2019s failure to communicate with him regarding defendant\u2019s appeal should be viewed as per se ineffective assistance of counsel, meriting a new appeal for defendant. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-13\">The two-pronged <em>Strickland </em>standard, adopted in <em>Morrison, </em>first requires defendant to demonstrate that counsel\u2019s performance fell below an objective standard of reasonableness and, if that is the case, the defense was prejudiced by counsel\u2019s action or inaction. <em>Strickland, supra, </em>466 <em>U.S. </em>at 693, 104 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2067, 80 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number><em>L.Ed.</em>2d at 697. The second prong requires a finding that there was a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different. <em>Id. </em>at 694, 104 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2068, 80 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 698.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-5\">We certainly find that counsel\u2019s failure to communicate with his client falls below objective standards of reasonableness and that the first prong of the <em>Strickland </em>test was met. The second prong, however, is more problematic. Defendant does not specifically outline what was deficient with respect to the argument appellate counsel made on his behalf in his direct appeal. We recognize his claim that he \u201cwould have participated in his appeal\u201d but the substance of that participation and any omission or change in the appeal is not specifically set forth. At oral argument on the PCR application, counsel argued that defendant</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b544-6\">wasn\u2019t able to communicate, for instance, to his attorney that the issue wasn\u2019t so much as it seems to be reflected in the record, that Lt. Edwards of the Plainfield Police Department was somebody who harbored a grudge against [defendant] but that in fact his prior involvement with Lt. Edwards in the Plainfield Police Department he believed colored how all of the individuals, including the individual who pursued him, responded to the situation and that that wasn\u2019t really made clear because he didn\u2019t have the opportunity to communicate with his appellant counsel ____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b544-7\">This argument by defense counsel is without any factual foundation. There is no affidavit or certification outlining whether any of the police officers involved in the pursuit and arrest of defendant had any knowledge of any animosity between defendant and Edwards in the first instance. There is nothing in the record that indicates that defense counsel, at trial, attempted to develop any bias that the pursuing officers may have had against defendant. That type of showing is necessary to advance defendant\u2019s PCR claim. See <em>State v. Cummings, </em>321 <em>N.J.Super. </em>154, 170, 728 A.2d 307 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>162 <em>N.J. </em>199, 743 A.2d 852 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b544-8\">Moreover, the point being advanced by counsel, i.e., trial counsel should have explored any bias or animosity among defendant and the arresting officers, would go to the ineffective assistance of trial counsel, not appellate counsel. If trial counsel did not investigate, develop, and question the arresting officers on the issue of animus <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>among defendant and the officers, that issue would not be appropriate on direct appeal in any event. <em>See Preciose, supra, </em>129 <em>N.J. </em>at 460, 609 A.2d 1280.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-6\">We, therefore, agree with the analysis of the PCR court that the second prong of the <em>Strickland </em>test was not met, and we reject the argument that the failure to communicate by appellate counsel with his client is a per se violation of the guarantee of effective assistance of counsel which merits a new appeal without the need to make the required showings under <em>Strickland.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b545-7\">In <em>Rue, </em>the New Jersey Supreme Court held that an attorney who is representing a defendant in a PCR matter is responsible to communicate with his client and investigate claims. <em>Rue, supra, </em>175 <em>N.J. </em>at 18, 811 A.2d 425. Further, such an attorney must also advance any claim insisted upon by a defendant, regardless of whether the attorney deems them without merit. <em>Id. </em>at 17, 811 A.2d 425. <em>See R. </em>3:22-6(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b545-8\">Both counsel and the court, during the hearing on the PCR petition, discussed whether the principles of <em>Rue </em>should be applied to appellate counsel in this case. <em>Rue </em>held that in a PCR setting, an attorney is responsible to communicate with his client and investigate claims. <em>Rue, supra, </em>175 <em>N.J. </em>at 18, 811 A.2d 425. <em>See R. </em>3:22-6. <em>Rue </em>also holds that counsel must advance any claims the client desires to forward in a petition. <em>Rue, supra, </em>175 <em>N.J. </em>at 19, 811 A.2d 425; <em>R. </em>3:22-6(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b545-9\">We note that the underpinning of <em>Rue </em>is the Court\u2019s interpretation of <em>R. </em>3:22-6(d), which requires PCR \u201ccounsel [to] advance any grounds insisted upon by defendant notwithstanding that counsel deems them without merit.\u201d <em>R. </em>3:22-6(d). That mandate does not apply to appellate counsel. <em>Jones v. Barnes, </em>463 <em>U.S. </em>745, 753-54, 103 <em>S.Ct. </em>3308, 3314, 77 L.Ed.2d 987, 996 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b545-10\">The United States Supreme Court has held that a defendant does not have a constitutional right to have appellate counsel raise every non-frivolous issue that defendant requests on appeal. <em>Ibid. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>Counsel for defendant acknowledges that applying <em>Rue </em>to appellate counsel does not mean that appellate counsel would be required to advance every claim insisted upon by a client on appeal. In her brief, defense counsel \u201cacknowledgets] that would be contrary to the ethics rules and guidelines requiring an attorney not to raise frivolous claims (i.e., <em>R.P.C. </em>3.1) and a denial of the discretion afforded appellate counsel so that he/she can construct the most effective argument(s) in favor of the ends desired.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b546-5\">Consequently, the only question is whether the principles of <em>Rue </em>requiring an attorney to communicate with his or her client and to investigate claims in connection with a PCR petition should apply to appellate counsel. We are satisfied that the requirement for appellate counsel to communicate and consult with his or her client is already embodied in the Rules of Professional Conduct, particularly <em>R.P.C. </em>1.2 and 1.4.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-6\">Therefore, after reviewing the arguments in this matter, we agree with the trial judge\u2019s finding that while counsel was deficient in not communicating with his client, defendant failed to demonstrate the second prong of <em>Strickland. </em>We decline to deviate from the two-prong <em>Strickland </em>test to hold that it is a per se violation of the guarantee of effective assistance of counsel where appellate counsel fails to communicate with the client, automatically meriting a new appeal. We also see no need to apply <em>Rue </em>to communication between appellate counsel and defendant because the Rules of Professional Conduct adequately address the point.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-7\">With respect to the other arguments defendant raised in his brief, but not set forth in specific points, we find that they are without sufficient merit to warrant discussion in a written opinion. <em>See R. </em>2:ll-3(e)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b546-8\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b542-9\"> <em>Strickland v.
