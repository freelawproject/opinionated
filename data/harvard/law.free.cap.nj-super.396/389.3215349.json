Defendant was sentenced to serve ninety consecutive days of incarceration and complete ninety days of community service; pay a $1,000 fine, $33 in court costs, $50 VCCB, $200 DDE/Sureharge, $75 SNSF; and have his driver\u2019s license suspended for ten years.

Guzman rendered an opinion dated December 22, 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-6\">We have carefully considered defendant\u2019s arguments in light of the applicable law and we are satisfied that his arguments lack sufficient merit to warrant discussion in a written opinion. <em>R. </em>2:ll-3(e)(2). We affirm substantially for the reasons stated by Judge Guzman in his opinion. Nevertheless, we add the following comments.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-7\">As Judge Guzman noted in his opinion, the Passaic County SLAP Program was not initiated until 2003, ten years after the offense was committed. Consequently, it was not a sentencing option at the time. Just as the 1993 DWI statute applies to defendant, so do the sentencing options available at that time. <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>1:1-15; <em>State v. Chambers, 377 N.J.Super. </em>365, 372, 872 A.2d 1109 (App.Div.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b421-8\">Defendant\u2019s reliance on <em>State v. Grabowski, </em>388 <em>N.J.Super. </em>431, 908 A.2d 861 (Law Div.2006), is substantially misplaced. First, the Law Division decision is not binding on any court. Second, the Law Division decision, rendered on June 26, 2006, is contrary to <em>State v. Luthe, </em>383 <em>N.J.Super. </em>512, 892 A.2d 736 (App.Div.2006), decided March 6, 2006 \u2014 three months before <em>Grabowski. Luthe is </em>binding on the Law Division.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-9\">In <em>Luthe, </em>we addressed the 2004 amendment to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>SOA-SO, commonly referred to as \u201cMichael\u2019s Law,\u201d which mandated \u201ca term of not less than 180 days in a county jail or workhouse, except that the court may lower such term for each day, not exceeding [ninety] days, served participating in a drug or alcohol inpatient rehabilitation program.\u201d We noted in <em>Luthe </em>that where the statutory \u201cmandate is clear, we need not resort to extrinsic evidence to discern the Legislature\u2019s intent in enacting this amendment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 514, 892 A.2d 736. The 1993 DWI statute was no less clear than the 2004 amendment. The sentencing options in the 1993 statute for a third offender were 180 days \u201cexcept that the court may lower such term for each day, not exceeding ninety days, served performing community service.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>SLAP is not an option. Weekend service is not an option. Defendant is, therefore, required to serve the ninety days incarceration and complete ninety days community service as ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b420-16\"> There is no explanation in the record for the delay between the time the offense was committed in October 1993 and August 2005 when he appeared for sentencing.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
