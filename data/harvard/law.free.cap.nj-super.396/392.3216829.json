A jury found defendant guilty of two counts of second-degree robbery, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:15-1. The first victim was a teller in a bank, and the second victim was a salesman at a car dealership. The judge sentenced defendant to two consecutive ten-year terms of incarceration, eighty-five percent of both to be served without possibility of parole, and two three-year terms of parole supervision. <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>20:43-7.2. The judge also imposed a $200 VCCB assessment, a $150 SNSF assessment and a $30 LEOTEF penalty. On appeal, defendant challenges his conviction for robbery of the bank teller and contends that his consecutive, maximum sentences are excessive. We reverse and remand his conviction for robbery of the bank teller and remand his sentence for robbery of the car salesman.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-10\">On February 2, 2004, defendant took a cab to the Cape Savings Bank in Atlantic City and asked the driver to wait. Inside defendant handed the teller a withdrawal slip in the amount of $5000. The teller asked defendant if he had an account, and he said \u201cNo.\u201d She told him she could not give him the money. Defendant responded, \u201cPlease hurry up. I know how to get it.\u201d The teller hesitated, defendant raised his voice and repeated his demand and warning: \u201cHurry up. I know how to get it.\u201d He then jumped over a bullet-proof glass barrier and onto the counter on the opposite side.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>When the teller realized that defendant was going to come over the glass barrier, she dropped the keys to the cash drawer, ran to an adjacent room and locked the door. Although defendant did not touch or threaten her at any point, she was afraid and thought that defendant might kill her or do something else. Defendant took approximately $2500 and left the bank.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-5\">The cab driver, who had awaited defendant\u2019s return, took him to a ear dealership. Defendant went in and took a car key from the desk of Erie Santana, a salesman who was using the telephone. By the time defendant found the car that matched the key among those in the lot, Santana was outside. He stepped between the door and the driver\u2019s seat in an effort to prevent defendant from closing the car door. Defendant put the car in reverse. A struggle ensued. Santana managed to remove the key and leave the car. Defendant grabbed him by the shirt and tie, but Santana was able to retreat to the showroom. Defendant followed and demanded the key. They struggled again when defendant tried to leave the showroom and Santana tried to block his exit. By the time the police arrived, Santana had defendant pinned against a ear in the lot.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-6\">Santana had a mark on his neck, which defendant referred to as a \u201ctatoo.\u201d He also had a red mark on his forehead. Defendant had $2310 in cash. The cab driver and several bank tellers identified him. Defendant did not testify at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-7\">Defense counsel requested a jury charge on lesser crimes included in robbery with respect to defendant\u2019s conduct in the bank. Considering defendant\u2019s demand for money and his climbing over the glass barrier from the perspective of the teller, the judge determined that there was no rational basis for a charge other than robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-8\">Defendant raises the following issues on appeal:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b426-9\">I. THE TRIAL COURT COMMITTED PLAIN ERROR BY NOT ACQUITTING DEFENDANT OF ROBBERY ON COUNT ONE, AND COMPOUNDED THE ERROR BY REFUSING TO INSTRUCT THE JURY ON THEFT FROM THE PERSON AS A LESSER-INCLUDED OFFENSE. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>(U.S. CONST. AMENDS. V, VI AND XIV; <em>N.J. CONST. </em>(1947), ART. I, 1\u00cdU1, 9 AND 10).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b427-6\">A. [The judge] committed plain <em>error in not </em>acquitting Mr. Cassady of robbery. [Not raised below.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b427-7\">B. [The judge] declined to charge the jury with the lesser included offense of theft from the person, violating defendant\u2019s right to due process.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b427-8\">II. THE IMPOSITION <em>OF TWO </em>MAXIMUM CONSECUTIVE SENTENCES FOR SECOND-DEGREE ROBBERIES THAT WERE NOT EXTRAORDINARY WAS MANIFESTLY EXCESSIVE, UNDULY PUNITIVE AND NOT IN CONFORMANCE WITH THE CODE OF CRIMINAL JUSTICE.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b427-9\">Defendant\u2019s claim that the evidence is inadequate to support his conviction for robbery of the bank teller lacks sufficient merit to warrant extended discussion in a written opinion. <em>R. </em>2:ll-3(e)(2). In addressing this claim, we must view the State\u2019s evidence, and all the reasonable inferences available from that evidence, in the light most favorable to the State, and we must determine whether the evidence, so viewed, is adequate to permit a reasonable juror to find each element of the offense beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>See State v. Brown, </em>80 <em>N.J. </em>587, 591, 404 A.2d 1111 (1979); <em>State v. Reyes, </em>50 <em>N.J. </em>454, 459, 236 A.2d 385 (1967); <em>see also Jackson v. Virginia, </em>443 <em>U.S. </em>307, 318-19, 99 <em>S.Ct. </em>2781, 2788-89, 61 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>560, 573 (1979); <em>State v. Spivey, </em>179 <em>N.J. </em>229, 236, 844 A.2d 512 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b427-10\">The State may establish robbery by proof that the defendant, \u201cin the course of committing a theft[,] ... threatened] another with or purposely put[ ] him in fear of immediate bodily injury.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:15-la(2). The evidence of defendant\u2019s course of conduct in the bank includes his submission of a withdrawal slip to a teller in a bank in which he had no account, his demand for the teller to hurry up, the threat implicit in his statement that he knew how to get the money and his theft of more than $2000. This evidence and the inferences it provides are more than adequate to permit the jurors to find, beyond a reasonable doubt, that defendant threatened the teller or purposely put her in fear of immediate bodily injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>The question raised by the judge\u2019s denial of defense counsel\u2019s request for a jury instruction on the lesser-included crime of theft at the bank, however, is not whether the evidence was adequate to <em>permit </em>a finding that defendant committed robbery. The standard is different: \u201cwhether the evidence presents a rational basis on which the jury <em>could acquit </em>the defendant of the greater charge and convict the defendant of the lesser.\u201d <em>State v. Brent, </em>137 <em>N.J. </em>107, 117, 644 A.2d 583 (1994) (emphasis added). The judge may not reject the request for a charge on a lesser crime because he or she concludes the jury could find guilt and is not \u201clikely\u201d to accept defendant\u2019s view of the evidence. <em>State v. Savage, </em>172 <em>N.J. </em>374, 397, 799 A.2d 477 (2002). The judge must consider whether the jury would \u201chave a rational basis\u201d for accepting defendant\u2019s claim that an element unique to the greater crime is not established by the evidence but the elements of the lesser crime are. <em>Ibid.; N.J.S.A. </em>2C:1-8e.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-5\">The distinct standards require caution in relying upon prior precedents. A holding that the evidence is adequate to support a finding of each element of robbery simply means that the evidence permits a finding of guilt. It says nothing about whether the same evidence could also rationally support a finding that the State failed to establish an element required for conviction of robbery but not required for conviction of theft. <em>See, e.g., State v. Samuels, </em>189 <em>N.J. </em>236, 914 A.2d 1250 (2007) (concluding that evidence was adequate to support a conviction for robbery but also concluding that a charge on the lesser crime of attempted robbery was required).</p>\n<p id=\"b428-6\">Defense counsel argued that in the absence of any direct threat to inflict immediate bodily injury or a gesture directly threatening such injury, the jurors could rationally conclude that defendant did not have the purpose required for conviction of robbery on these <em>facts </em>\u2014 i.e., a purpose to put the teller in fear of immediate bodily injury. <em>See N.J.S.A </em>2C:15-1a(2); <em>State v. Smalls, </em>310 <em>N.J.Super. </em>285, 292, 708 A.2d 737 (App.Div.1998) (discussing purpose required in the absence of direct threat); <em>State v. Planes, </em>274 <em>N.J.Super. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>190, 196, 643 A.2d 658 (Law Div.1994) (same); <em>cf. State v. Sewell, </em>127 <em>N.J. </em>133, 147-49, 603 A.2d 21 (1992) (concluding that proof of knowledge, which requires proof of the defendant\u2019s practical certainty that a result will flow from the conduct, is sufficient where a robbery charge is based on infliction of bodily injury).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-6\">In order to find that it was defendant\u2019s purpose to put the teller in fear of immediate bodily injury, the jurors had to conclude that it was his \u201cconscious object\u201d to put the teller in \u201cfear of immediate bodily injury.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:2-2b(1); <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:15-1a(2). Defendant said, \u201cHurry up. I know how to get it.\u201d He then climbed over a glass divider. By the time he was on the teller\u2019s side of that divider, she had moved away. She testified that defendant did not threaten her but that she was afraid that he would harm her. This evidence provided a rational basis for the jurors to conclude that defendant\u2019s purpose was consistent with his statement and conduct \u2014 to inform the teller that if she did not give him the money he would take it but not to compel her to turn the money over out of fear of immediate bodily injury. Where, as here, the defendant requests the instruction on a lesser-included offense, the question is not whether the inference the defendant suggests is the most likely but whether there is a rational basis for that inference.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-7\">We conclude that it was error to deny defense counsel\u2019s request for a charge on the lesser-included crime of theft. The evidence afforded a rational basis for acquittal of robbery, based on the absence of the requisite purpose to put the teller in fear of immediate bodily injury, and conviction of theft, based on defendant\u2019s taking of the money. Accordingly, defendant\u2019s conviction for robbery of the bank teller must be reversed and remanded for further proceedings. <em>See Savage, supra, </em>172 <em>N.J. </em>at 397-98, 799 A.2d 477.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>Our reversal of defendant\u2019s conviction for robbery of the bank teller makes it unnecessary to consider his objection to the sentence he received for that crime and the judge\u2019s decision to impose a consecutive sentence for the robbery at the ear dealership. We must consider, however, whether his ten-year sentence for the second robbery is excessive.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-5\">In reviewing a sentence, this court may not \u201csubstitute its judgment for that of the trial court.\u201d <em>State v. Natale, </em>184 <em>N.J. </em>458, 489, 878 A.2d 724 (2005). Nonetheless, appellate review of sentences \u201cplay[s] \u2018a central role\u2019 in carrying out the Code\u2019s goals of \u2018promoting uniformity and consistency\u2019 in sentencing.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 488-89, 878 A.2d 724 (quoting <em>State v. Jarbath, </em>114 <em>N.J. </em>394, 400, 555 A.2d 559 (1989)). Thus, we are \u201cbound to affirm a sentence, even if [we] would have arrived at a different result, as long as the trial court properly identifies and balances aggravating and mitigating factors that are supported by competent credible evidence in the record,\u201d <em>State v. O\u2019Donnell, </em>117 <em>N.J. </em>210, 215, 564 A.2d 1202 (1989), but cannot affirm a sentence that is based on a misapplication of the law or factual findings not supported by the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-6\">At the time of sentencing, defendant had pending in the State of Florida one charge of grand theft and five charges based on worthless checks. He had one prior conviction in this state for receiving stolen property. That conviction was entered on January 30, 2004, and defendant was sentenced to time served, 160 days, and a two-year term of probation. The robberies with which defendant was charged in this ease were committed on February 2,2004, within days of his release on probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-7\">The trial judge found the following aggravating factors: a risk that defendant will commit another offense, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:44-la(3), based on the fact that defendant committed these crimes three days after his release from jail on probation; the extent of defendant\u2019s criminal record and the seriousness of the offense, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:44-la(6), based on his single prior conviction and the pending charges in Florida; the need to deter, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:44-la(9), based on defendant\u2019s commission of this crime while on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>probation and the general need to deter crime sprees involving the use of force and intimidation in committing robbery. The judge described defendant\u2019s criminal record as \u201ca strong aggravating factor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b431-6\">The judge found no mitigating factors. On the ground that \u201cin finding the defendant guilty of robbery, the jury found that defendant knowingly caused or threatened serious bodily harm,\u201d the judge rejected defendant\u2019s claims that his conduct neither caused nor threatened serious harm and that he did not contemplate that his conduct would cause such harm. <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>2C:44-lb(l)-(2) (stating these mitigating factors).</p>\n<p id=\"b431-7\">It is not our role to \u201csecond-guess\u201d a trial court\u2019s finding of sufficient facts to support an aggravating or mitigating factor, but there must be some support in the record and some recognition of judicial decisions construing the factors. <em>State v. Carey, </em>168 <em>N.J. </em>413, 426-27, 775 A.2d 495 (2001); <em>see Natale, supra, </em>184 <em>N.J. </em>at 489, 878 A.2d 724.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-8\">The trial court\u2019s finding of a \u201cstrong\u201d aggravating factor based on \u201c[t]he extent of the defendant\u2019s prior criminal record and the seriousness of the offenses,\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:44-la(6), is not supported. Defendant had one prior conviction and several pending charges. Charges cannot be considered as the equivalent of convictions. <em>See State v. Green, </em>62 <em>N.J. </em>547, 571-72, 303 A.2d 312 (1973) (discussing the uses of prior arrests and pending charges that are permissible); <em>State v. Walters, </em>279 <em>N.J.Super. </em>626, 633-34, 653 A.2d 1176 (App.Div.) (relating the teachings of <em>Green </em>to consideration of the aggravating and mitigating factors enumerated in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:44-1), <em>cerlif. denied, </em>141 <em>N.J. </em>96, 660 A.2d 1195 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b431-9\">The reason the judge gave for rejecting mitigating factors based on the fact that defendant did not cause or contemplate serious harm, <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:44-lb(l)-(2), is similarly unsupported by the record. The judge rejected these factors on the ground that the jury found \u201cthat defendant knowingly caused or threat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>ened serious bodily harm,\u201d but the jury was not even asked to consider \u201cserious bodily harm\u201d and made no relevant finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-5\">Because the finding of an aggravating factor based on defendant\u2019s criminal history and the reason given for rejecting mitigating factors based on harm caused and contemplated are not supported by the record, we remand for reconsideration of defendant\u2019s sentence on this conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-6\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b429-8\"> III tills case, there was no evidence of an actual threat to inflict immediate bodily injury either by words or menacing gesture. Accordingly, the question was whether defendant \"purposely put [the teller] in fear of immediate bodily injury.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:15-1a(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b432-7\">FUENTES, J.A.D.,</author>\n<p id=\"AIL\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-8\">I concur with the decision of my colleagues in the majority to affirm defendant\u2019s conviction of second-degree robbery in the ease involving the automobile dealership. I also agree that defendant\u2019s sentence must be vacated, and the matter remanded for re-sentencing consistent with the mandate of the majority opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-9\">With respect to the crime committed against the bank teller, the majority concludes that the trial court committed reversible error when it denied defendant\u2019s application to submit for the jury\u2019s consideration the crime of third-degree theft, as a lesser included offense of second-degree robbery. I disagree and therefore respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-10\">As my colleagues in the majority correctly note, the applicable standard of review is well-settled. A lesser-ineluded offense must be submitted to the jury when there is a \u201crational basis\u201d for a conviction of that crime. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:l-8e; <em>see State v. Mauricio, </em>117 <em>N.J. </em>402, 418, 568 A.2d 879 (1990). This is a low threshold. \u201c[I]f on the evidence it would not be <em>idle </em>to have the jury decide\u201d whether defendant had committed the lesser-ineluded offense, it is error not to charge that offense. <em>State v. Crisantos, </em>102 <em>N.J. </em>265, 278, 508 A.2d 167 (1986) (quoting <em>State v. Sinclair, </em>49 <em>N.J. </em>525, 540, 231 A.2d 565 (1967)). As long as the proofs leave room for a reasonable dispute, the lesser-ineluded instruction should be given.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-11\">Defendant\u2019s second-degree robbery conviction was predicated on a theory of culpability through which defendant, \u201cwhile in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>course of committing a theft,\u201d threatened the bank teller, or \u201cpurposely\u201d put her \u201cin fear of immediate bodily injury.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:ll-la defines \u201cbodily injury\u201d as \u201cphysical pain, illness, or any impairment of physical condition.\u201d By contrast, a person commits a theft if he unlawfully takes moveable property of another with the purpose of depriving him thereof. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:20-3.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-6\">Against this backdrop, the majority holds that the following governing facts provide a rational basis from which a reasonable jury could find that defendant <em>did not </em>threatened the bank teller, or <em>purposely put her in fear of immediate bodily injury. N.J.S.A. </em>2C:15-la(2).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b433-7\">On February 2, 2004, defendant took a cab to the Cape Savings Bank in Atlantic City and asked the driver to wait. Inside defendant handed the teller a withdrawal slip in the amount of $5000. The teller asked defendant if he had an account, and he said \u201cNo.\u201d She told him she could not give him the money. Defendant responded, \u201cPlease hurry up. I know how to get it.\u201d <em>The telle,r hesitated, defendant raised his voice and repeated Ms demand and warning: \u201cHurry up. I know how to get it.\u201d He then jumped over a bullet-proof glass barrier and onto the counter on the opposite side.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b433-8\"><em>When the teller realised that defendant was going to come over the glass barr\u00ed,er, she dropped the keys to the cash drawer, ran to an adjacent room and locked the door. Although defendant did not touch or threaten her at any point, she was afraid and thought that defendant might kill her or do something else. </em>Defendant took approximately $2500 and left the bank.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b433-9\"><em>[State v. Cassady, </em>Op. at 395-96, 934 A.2d at 645-46 (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b433-10\">It bears emphasis that when fear is the basis of the robbery, \u201c[n]o special words or conduct are required to constitute a threat or to purposely put someone in fear of immediate bodily injury.\u201d <em>State ex rel. L.W., </em>333 <em>N.J.Super. </em>492, 497, 755 A.2d 1245 (App.Div.2000). Immediate assaultive conduct during the commission or attempted commission of a theft is sufficient to elevate a third-degree theft to a second-degree robbery. <em>State v. Lopez, </em>187 <em>N.J. </em>91, 98-99, 900 A.2d 779 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b433-11\">The focus of the analysis is not on the victim, but on the actions and purpose of the defendant. Thus, whether the bank teller felt afraid after defendant\u2019s words and actions is not the question. As we noted in <em>State v. Smalls, </em>310 <em>N.J.Super. </em>285, 292, 708 A.2d 737 (App.Div.1998): \u201cA cautious person ... may exhibit fear in many <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>settings that are not criminal. The focus of the robbery is on the conduct of the accused, rather than on the characteristics of the victim.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b434-5\">Thus, as the following facts in <em>Smalls </em>illustrate, a subjective belief by the victim that defendant\u2019s conduct was threatening or assaultive was legally insufficient to meet the \u201crational basis\u201d threshold required under the statute:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b434-6\">Here, the victim had conversations with first [defendant\u2019s companion] and, later, after Smalls arrived, with Smalls. At no time did either defendant threaten the victim. Although the conduct of [defendant\u2019s companion] in holding his newspaper and referring to rent receipts made the victim believe [the companion] may have had a mental problem, there was no evidence that either defendant purposely put her \u201cin fear of immediate bodily injury.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:15-la(2). [The companion] had requested help from the victim while Smalls later chided the victim for not helping [his companion]. Eventually, the two men were in front of and behind the victim. To be sure, no special words and/or conduct are required to make out a threat or to purposely put someone in fear of immediate bodily injury, but the totality of the circumstances presented must be considered. While there may be circumstances where conduct alone, without threats by one or more persons, may be sufficient to justify a conclusion that the persons purposely placed the victim in fear of immediate bodily injury, this is not such a ease. We leave that to another day.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b434-7\">\n<em>Ubid.1</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b434-8\">In sharp contrast to the facts in <em>Smalls, </em>defendant here demanded money in a loud and intimidating voice. When this proved unsuccessful, defendant immediately jumped over a bulletproof glass partition designed to provide a measure of safety and protection to bank personnel handling money; all this speaks of only one rational construction: defendant\u2019s purpose was to place the bank teller in fear of immediate bodily injury in order to carry out or otherwise facilitate the commission of the theft.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-9\">Unlike a situation where defendant could obtain access to the money without removing its apparent guardian, (such as reaching into an open cash-drawer in a supermarket checkout), defendant here needed both: (1) to overcome the glass partition separating the public and private space in the bank; and (2) to chase away the teller who was standing between him and the bank\u2019s money. The conduct was thus unambiguously threatening and palpably <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>egregious. This was a bank robbery: plain and simple. In my view, no rational jury could come to any other conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-6\">In this light, I would affirm the trial court\u2019s ruling rejecting defendant\u2019s application to charge third-degree theft as a lesser-included offense of second-degree robbery. Because the majority concluded otherwise, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
