Dolores Graziano, Proudman\u2019s daughter, was in the apartment at the time of the fire. Proudman\u2019s liability carrier, Mercer Mutual Insurance Company (Mercer Mutual), filed an interpleader action naming various potential claimants, including Dolores and her husband, Albert, seeking to pay the full limits of its policy ($100,000) into court.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-12\">In February 2006, Dolores and Albert filed, with leave of court, a third-party complaint against R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company, seeking damages for personal injuries allegedly sustained by Dolores as a result of the fire. In October 2006, Mercer Mutual settled its interpleader action, leaving only the Grazianos\u2019 (plaintiffs) third-party complaint against R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Compa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>ny (defendant).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b342-4\">On May 12, 2006, defendant moved to dismiss the third-party complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. <em>R. </em>4:6-2(e). Following oral argument on the motion, the judge dismissed plaintiffs\u2019 third-party complaint. Plaintiffs appeal and we now affirm substantially for the reasons set forth by the motion judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-5\">In their complaint, plaintiffs alleged that the Viceroy cigarette, manufactured by defendant, was defective and a cause of the fire because it \u201cwas not a self-extinguishing cigarette known as a \u2018Fire Safe\u2019 cigarette ... currently sold and distributed in New York and California.\u201d Their complaint asserted that defendant was liable under the Products Liability Act. Dismissing the suit, the motion judge found that plaintiffs failed to assert a cause of action because the inherent danger of the product, i.e., \u201cthe capacity ... to ignite a fire [and] ... burn ... cannot be completely eliminated.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b342-6\">To understand plaintiffs\u2019 assertion, we first address, conceptually, self-extinguishing cigarettes and recent applicable legislation. On May 4, 2007, recognizing, in part, that \u201c[c]igarettes are the leading cause of fire deaths\u201d and injuries and \u201c[c]igarette-caused fires result in billions of dollars of property losses\u201d and \u201cunnecessarily jeopardize firefighters,\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>54:40A-55, our Legislature passed The Reduced Cigarette Ignition Propensity and Firefighter Protection Act (Reduced Cigarette Ignition Act), <em>N.J.S.A. </em>54:40A-54 to -66, effective June 1, 2008. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>54:40A-55j declares that \u201c[i]t is ... fitting and proper for this State to adopt the cigarette fire safety standard that is in effect in New York State to reduce the likelihood that cigarettes will cause fires and result in deaths, injuries and property damage.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b343-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>Subject to certain enumerated fines and penalties, all cigarettes sold in this State are to be certified as meeting certain test criteria as set forth in the \u201cStandard Test Method for Measuring the Ignition Strength of Cigarettes\u201d in accordance with the American Society of Testing and Materials. <em>N.J.S.A </em>54:40A-57a(l). That standard requires in part that \u201c[n]o more than 25 percent of the cigarettes tested in a test trial ... shall exhibit full length burns.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>54:40A-57a(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b343-6\">The Products Liability Act (PLA) codified the case law, leaving \u201cintact\u201d the three theories, specifically defective manufacture, defective design, and defective warnings, by which a manufacturer or seller may be held strictly liable for harm caused by a product. <em>Roberts v. Rich Foods, Inc., </em>139 <em>N.J. </em>365, 375, 654 A.2d 1365 (1995). However, in so doing, the PLA provided, under Section 3a(2), an affirmative defense not previously recognized in the common law. William A. Dreier et al., <em>New Jersey Products Liability &amp; Toxic Tort Law, </em>\u00a7 14:3-lb (2007). <em>N.J.S.A </em>2A:58C~3 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-7\">a. In any product liability action against a manufacturer or seller for harm allegedly caused by a product that was designed in a defective manner, the manufacturer or seller shall not be liable if:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-8\">(2) The characteristics of the product are known to the ordinary consumer or user, and the harm was caused by an unsafe aspect of the product that is an inherent characteristic of the product and that would be recognized by the ordinary person who uses or consumes the product with the ordinary knowledge common to the class of persons for whom the product is intended, except that this paragraph shall not apply to industrial machinery or other equipment used in the workplace and it is not intended to apply to dangers posed by products such as machinery or equipment that can feasibly be eliminated without impairing the usefulness of the product....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b343-9\">Thus, under the PLA, \u201c[i]f the harm caused by a product \u2018would be recognized by the ordinary person who uses or consumes the product\u2019 and if the harm stems from an \u2018inherent characteristic of the product,\u2019 then the harm is not actionable.\u201d <em>Roberts, supra, </em>139 <em>N.J. </em>at 378, 654 A.2d 1365 (internal citation omitted). A product that satisfies this definition \u201cis, by statutory definition, not defectively designed.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>The two expressed circumstances <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>under which the Section 3a(2) defense is not available are whether (1) the product is workplace equipment or (2) the \u201cdanger[ ] posed by [the] product[ ] ... can feasibly be eliminated without impairing the usefulness of the product.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:58C-3a(2). We are concerned here with the second exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-6\">Generally, where a defendant raises the absolute defense, thus establishing the lack of a defect, the plaintiff has the burden to establish \u201cby a preponderance of the evidence that the defendant could have eliminated the danger without impairing the usefulness of the product.\u201d <em>Roberts, supra, </em>139 <em>N.J. </em>at 379, 654 A.2d 1365. When a plaintiff meets that burden, a jury question is presented whether the product is defectively designed even though the defendant has established the Section 3a(2) defense. <em>Id. </em>at 382, 654 A.2d 1365.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-7\">On appeal, plaintiffs assert that defendant cannot gain the benefit of the defense accorded by Section 3a(2) because the inherent characteristic of the product is its non-self-extinguishing nature. Thus posited, plaintiff argues that because \u201cself-extinguishing\u201d cigarettes exist, defendant is unable to show that a non-self-extinguishing characteristic cannot be eliminated. Plaintiffs\u2019 argument is circuitous. It is the unsafe aspect of the product that qualifies as the inherent characteristic, recognized by the ordinary consumer, that triggers the defense, not the particular design of the product. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:58C-3a(2). Here, the danger is that a burning cigarette creates a fire hazard, which could result in property damage or injury. To qualify under Section 3a(2), the dangerous characteristic must be inherent. An inherent characteristic is one that cannot be eliminated without impairing the usefulness of the product. <em>Roberts, supra, </em>139 <em>N.J. </em>at 380, 654 A.2d 1365.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-8\">The burden placed on the plaintiff under Section 3a(2) is to \u201cprove that the defendant could have eliminated the danger without eliminating an inherent characteristic of the product, and thereby significantly diminishing the product\u2019s intended use.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 382, 654 A.2d 1365. At oral argument on appeal, plaintiffs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>conceded that the self-extinguishing cigarette contemplated in the complaint only reduces the fire danger, it does not eliminate it. Indeed, as previously noted, the Reduced Cigarette Ignition Act does not call for the elimination of the fire danger, only its reduction. More importantly, burning is the essential characteristic of a cigarette, without which it would be rendered useless.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-6\">Because plaintiffs admittedly do not allege that self-extinguishing cigarettes can eliminate the danger, they fail to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. Applied to facts here, plaintiffs do not allege that a self-extinguishing cigarette eliminates a cigarette\u2019s fire danger without eliminating its burning characteristic, thus significantly diminishing the user\u2019s ability to smoke it. Stated another way, although the existence of a self-extinguishing cigarette may reduce the danger, i.e., burning time, a complete elimination of the fire hazard would obviate all burning, which would destroy the product\u2019s intended use-to be smoked. <em>See Roberts, supra, </em>139 <em>N.J. </em>at 381-82, 654 A.2d 1365.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b345-7\">Plaintiffs also contend, as they did in the Law Division, that the second exception in Section 3a(2) does not apply to cigarettes because cigarettes are not \u201cmachinery or equipment.\u201d Again, we disagree. The basic principles of statutory construction are well settled. When dealing with questions of statutory construction, the Court first considers the plain meaning of the provision at issue. <em>State v. Hoffman, </em>149 <em>N.J. </em>564, 578, 695 A.2d 236 (1997); <em>State v. Szemple, </em>135 <em>N.J. </em>406, 421, 640 A.2d 817 (1994); <em>Merin v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number><em>Maglaki, </em>126 <em>N.J. </em>430, 434, 599 A.2d 1256 (1992). \u201cSuch language should be given its ordinary meaning, absent a legislative intent to the contrary.\u201d <em>Merin, supra, </em>126 <em>N.J. </em>at 434-35, 599 A.2d 1256. Where statutory provisions are \u201csilent or ambiguous,\u201d we must interpret the provision in light of the Legislature\u2019s intent. Ac<em>countemps v. Birch Tree Group, </em>115 <em>N.J. </em>614, 622, 560 A.2d 663 (1989); <em>Union County Bd. of Chosen Freeholders v. Union County Park Comm\u2019n, </em>41 <em>N.J. </em>333, 337, 196 A.2d 781 (1964). When determining legislative intent, we may consider legislative history, committee reports, and contemporaneous construction. <em>Hoffman, supra, </em>149 <em>N.J. </em>at 578, 695 A.2d 236. \u201c \u2018The primary task for the [c]ourt is to \u201ceffectuate the legislative intent in light of the language used and the objects sought to be achieved.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>Ibid. </em>(quoting <em>Merin, supra, </em>126 <em>N.J. </em>at 435, 599 A.2d 1256).</p>\n<p id=\"b346-4\">The plain import of the wording of the second exception of Section 3a(2), specifically, that \u201cit is not intended to apply to <em>dangers posed by products such as </em>machinery or equipment\u201d is one of inclusion, rather than limitation. (Emphasis added). The Senate Judiciary Committee Statement To Senate Committee Substitute for Senate No. 2805, March 23,1987, states that Section 3a(2) defenses are intended to apply to \u201cproducts whose characteristics are known to the ordinary consumer.\u201d It would be illogical to conclude that the exception to the Section 3a(2) defenses in cases where a product\u2019s dangers can be feasibly eliminated without impairing usefulness would not pertain to the same types of products for which the defenses are applicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b342-7\"> Because the third-party complaint is the only action remaining after the settlement, we refer to Albert and Dolores Graziano as \"plaintiffs\u201d and R.J. Reynolds as \"defendant.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b345-8\"> We note that our disposition is limited to the specific manner in which the products liability claims were advanced in this particular case, as they were pleaded in the third-party complaint, and as further clarified by counsel at oral argument before us. In particular1, we rely on counsel's concession that his clients are asserting that an alternative design would reduce, but not eliminate, the dangers of the prolonged burning of an unattended cigarette. In light of that concession, we need not address the viability of a products liability complaint, founded upon competent expert support, alleging that the risks of an unattended cigarette's prolonged burning could be totally eliminated by a self-extinguishing cigarette, or by some other feasible alternative cigarette design, without impairing the cigarette's utility to the smoker.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
