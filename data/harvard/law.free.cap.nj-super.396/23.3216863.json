However, the focus of the appeal is the enforceability of the ordinance that prevents the display of a large balloon in the shape of a rat during a labor dispute. We hold that the ordinance, which does not affect the parties\u2019 rights in the labor dispute, is not preempted by the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA), 29 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 151-69, nor does it abridge any party\u2019s freedom of expression. The Ordinance is not void for vagueness. It is content-neutral and the record does not support a claim that it was selectively enforced. Accordingly, the conviction of the union official that authorized display of the balloon is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-7\">Wayne P. DeAngelo, appeals from his conviction, in the Lawrence Township Municipal Court and again in the Law Division, following a trial de novo, of a violation of Lawrence Township Municipal Ordinance \u00a7 535(L)(2) (the Ordinance), which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b59-8\">L. <em>Prohibited Signs. </em>All signs not permitted by this Ordinance are hereby prohibited with the following signs specifically prohibited:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b59-10\">2. Banners, pennants, streamers, pinwheels, or similar devices; vehicle signs; portable signs, balloon signs or other inflated signs (excepting grand opening signs); and searchlights (excepting grand opening signs), displayed for the purpose of attracting the attention of pedestrians and motorists; unless otherwise excepted.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b59-11\">The facts are not disputed. <em>On </em>April 5, 2005, the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, Local 269 (IBEW) was hand-billing the general public on the sidewalk in front of Gold\u2019s Gym. DeAngelo was the senior IBEW official at the scene. As part of the labor action, the IBEW displayed a balloon in the shape of a rat, as a symbol of protest against unfair labor practices. We are advised that a rat is a well-known symbol <em>of </em>protesting unfair labor practices. According to the <em>Laborers\u2019 E. Region Org. Fund, </em>2005 <em>WL </em>1467350, 2005 <em>NLRB Lexis </em>273, at <em>*21 </em>(June 14, 2005), \u201c[t]he union\u2019s use of the rat constituted confrontational conduct intended to persuade third persons not to do business with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>[employer]. A rat is a well-known symbol of a labor dispute and is a signal to third parties that there is an invisible picket line they should not cross. The [NLRB] has noted that the term \u2018rat\u2019 means to \u2018go nonunion [,]\u2019 \u201d <em>Marquis Elevator Co., </em>217 <em>NLRB </em>461 n. 2 (1975) and is a synonym for the word \u201cscab,\u201d i.e., a strike replacement, or someone who refuses to join a union. <em>See Int\u2019l Union of Operating Eng\u2019rs, Local ISO v. Village of Orland, Park, </em>139 F.Supp.2d 950 (N.D.Ill.2001) (noting that \u201c[t]he rat has long been a symbol of labor unrest.\u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b60-6\">The balloon is approximately ten feet tall and has no writing on it. In response to a complaint by Gold\u2019s Gym, the police were summoned. Lawrence Township Police Officer Mark Harmon went to the scene and spoke with three IBEW leaders about the balloon. The leaders removed the balloon. According to Harmon, \u201capproximately [ ] 45 minutes later, [he] received a call from the dispatcher on the police radio. They had received a [second] call that the inflatable rat had been put back up.\u201d He returned to the scene and issued a summons to DeAngelo, charging that the inflatable rat is a \u201cballoon sign or other inflated sign,\u201d prohibited by Ordinance \u00a7 535(L)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b60-7\">DeAngelo moved to dismiss the summons challenging the constitutionality of the Ordinance. The State opposed the motion, stipulating to the facts and requesting that the municipal judge decide the legal issue: whether an inflatable rat is a type of sign that the Ordinance prohibits. The judge denied DeAngelo\u2019s motion to dismiss, determining that the display of the rat balloon sign was prohibited by the Ordinance unless a permit was issued.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-8\">Following a trial in the municipal court, DeAngelo was found guilty of violating the Ordinance. He was fined $100 and charged $33 for court costs. The fines and costs were stayed pending appeal to the Law Division. The Law Division found DeAngelo guilty of the same charge and imposed the same sanction. DeAngelo paid the fine and court costs and filed this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-9\">He raises several contentions, including federal preemption and constitutional challenges based on free speech, void for vagueness <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>and selective enforcement. We are not persuaded by any of these arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-5\">\n<em>The Rat Balloon Is Prohibited By The Ordinance</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b61-6\">DeAngelo first contends that the inflatable rat balloon is not a sign prohibited by the Ordinance. Specifically, he argues that \u201cbecause \u2018sign\u2019 is not defined by the Ordinance, the public is left guessing at the meaning of the Ordinance.\u201d DeAngelo then asserts that \u201ca sign simply does not include an inflatable rat devoid of any lettering or markings.\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-7\">The first step in construing the Ordinance is to examine its language. <em>Bergen Commercial Bank v. Sisler, </em>157 <em>N.J. </em>188, 202, 723 A.2d 944 (1999). The meaning derived from that language controls if it is clear and unambiguous. <em>Ibid. </em>It is axiomatic that \u201c[a]bsent a clear indication to the contrary, the language in the [Ordinance] is to be read in accordance with its plain and ordinary meaning.\u201d <em>Carpenter Tech. Corp. v. Admiral Ins. Co., </em>335 <em>N.J.Super. </em>510, 515, 762 A.2d 1066 (App.Div.2000), <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds, </em>172 <em>N.J. </em>504, 800 A.2d 54 (2002) (citations omitted). Thus, the absence of a definition in the text means that the plain and ordinary meaning is to be applied. If the text is predisposed to different interpretations, the court can consider extrinsic factors, such as the statute\u2019s purpose, legislative history, and statutory context to determine the legislature\u2019s intent. <em>Wingate v. Estate of Ryan, </em>149 <em>N.J. </em>227, 236, 693 A.2d 457 (1997); <em>Lesniak v. Budzash, </em>133 <em>N.J. </em>1, 626 A.2d 1073 (1993); <em>N.J. Builders, Owners &amp; Managers Ass\u2019n v. Blair, </em>60 <em>N.J. </em>330, 338, 288 A.2d 855 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b61-8\">Here, we conclude that the Ordinance\u2019s text is clear and unambiguous. The public need not guess at its meaning. It is true that the Ordinance does not define the term \u201csign.\u201d However, it does describe the types of signs which, are prohibited and gives examples. One of these is \u201cballoon signs or other inflated signs\u201d whose purpose is \u201cattracting the attention of pedestrians and motorists.\u201d Moreover, <em>Webster\u2019s New International Dictionary </em>defines the term \u201csign\u201d as a symbol, \u201ca conventional symbol or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>emblem which represents an idea, as a word, letter, or mark____ In writing and printing, an ideographic mark, figure, or picture ... conventionally used to represent a term or conception, usually technical.\u201d <em>Webster\u2019s New International Dictionary </em>2334 (2d ed. 1950). Here, the rat balloon at the location of union handbilling was clearly a sign carrying a symbolic message of a labor protest. Therefore, we reject DeAngelo\u2019s first contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-7\">Furthermore, we note that the summons was issued after Officer Harmon had asked that the balloon be removed because it violated the Ordinance. It was removed by IBEW officials and then inflated again.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-8\">\n<em>Federal Preemption</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b62-9\">DeAngelo argues that the Ordinance is preempted by the NLRA. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-10\">In the labor-management field, Congress \u201chas not expressly provided for exclusive federal jurisdiction.\u201d <em>Chamber of Commerce v. State, </em>89 <em>N.J. </em>131, 142-43, 445 A.2d 353 (1982); <em>see also Bldg. &amp; Constr. Trades Council v. Assoc. Builders &amp; Contractors of Mass./R.I., Inc., </em>507 <em>U.S. </em>218, 113 <em>S.Ct. </em>1190, 122 L.Ed.2d 565 (1993). In fact, New Jersey protects organized labor activity in its Constitution. <em>N.J. Const, </em>art. 1,1119. Nonetheless, the courts have derived from the Supremacy Clause of the United States Constitution, <em>U.S. Const. </em>Art. VI, el. 2, a general preemptive power to the NLRA over state laws regulating labor organizations. In <em>Metro. Life Ins. Co. v. Massachusetts, </em>471 <em>U.S. </em>724, 748, 105 <em>S.Ct. </em>2380, 85 L.Ed.2d 728 (1985), the United States Supreme Court \u201carticulated two distinct NLRA pre-emption principles.\u201d The first is the <em>Garmon </em>or primary jurisdiction doctrine, which prohibits states or territories from \u201c \u2018regulating activity that the NLRA protects, prohibits or arguably protects or prohibits.\u2019\u201d <em>San Diego Bldg. Trades Council v. Garmon, </em>359 <em>U.S. </em>236, 243-244, 79 <em>S.Ct. </em>773, 779, 3 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>775, 782 (1959); <em>Golden State Transit Corp. v. Los Angeles, </em>475 <em>U.S. </em>608, 613, 106 <em>S.Ct. </em>1395, 1398, 89 L.Ed.2d 616, 623 (1986) (quoting <em>Wisconsin Dep\u2019t of </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number><em>Indus., Labor &amp; Human Relations v. Gould, Inc., </em>475 <em>U.S. </em>282, 286, 106 <em>S.Ct. </em>1057, 1061, 89 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>223, 228 (1986)). On the other hand, the <em>Machinists </em>pre-emption,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the second doctrine, precludes state or territorial regulations \u201cconcerning conduct that Congress intended to be unregulated.\u201d <em>Lodge 76 Intern. Ass\u2019n of Machinists v. Wisconsin Employment Relations Commc\u2019n, </em>427 <em>U.S. </em>132, 96 <em>S.Ct. </em>2548, 49 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>396 (1976); <em>Golden State Transit Corp., </em>475 <em>U.S. </em>608, 614, 106 <em>S.Ct. </em>1395, 1398, 89 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>616, 623 (1986) (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b63-5\">In accordance with established preemption principles, where the preemptive effects of federal enactments are not explicit, the state\u2019s regulation should be sustained \u201cunless it conflicts with federal law or would frustrate the federal scheme, or unless [we] discern from the totality of the circumstances that Congress sought to occupy the field to the exclusion of the States.\u201d <em>Bldg. &amp; Constr. Trades Council, supra, </em>507 <em>U.S. </em>at 218, 113 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1190, 122 L.Ed.2d at 565 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b63-6\">DeAngelo cites in his brief to two Advice Memoranda, dated from 1996 and 2000. He argues that the NLRB General Counsel:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b63-7\">[Cjlearly held that the use of a rat, whether in the form of an inflatable balloon or a costume, in connection with handbilling, does not violate the NLRA and accordingly is protected activity.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b63-8\">However, decisions of administrative law judges (ALJ) are based upon applicable NLRB precedent, not Advice Memoranda. <em>Brandon Reg\u2019l Med.. Ctr., </em>2004 <em>WL </em>2843187, 2004 <em>NLRB Lexis </em>688, at *13-15 (Dec. 7, 2004), <em>aff'd on other grounds, </em>346 <em>NLRB </em>No. 22 (Jan. 9, 2006). In <em>Brandon Reg\u2019l Med. Ctr., </em>the federal ALJ determined that it is unlawful for unions to use inflatable rats to promote secondary boycotts because the rats engage in prohibited picketing. The ALJ determined that they were picketing because, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>in addition to handbilling, the union members set up a sixteen-foot tall inflatable rat. <em>Id. </em>2004 <em>WL </em>2843187, 2004 <em>NLRB Lexis </em>688, at *30. The ALJ found that the rat in conjunction with the handbillers constituted a \u201csurrogate picket.\u201d <em>Id. </em>2004 <em>WL </em>2843187, 2004 <em>NLRB Lexis </em>688, at *25, *29. The NLRB\u2019s General Counsel has endorsed this reasoning and has filed charges against at least one other union that has used inflatable rats. <em>See, e.g., Laborers\u2019 E. Region Organizing Fund, supra, </em>2005 <em>WL </em>1467350, 2005 <em>NLRB Lexis </em>273, at *1, *11-14.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-6\">We must emphasize that an activity that the NLRA permits or prohibits may still violate local laws that are not preempted by federal provisions. Therefore, such activity would be subject to sanctions. <em>See </em>Tzvi Mackson-Landsberg, <em>Is a Giant Inflatable Rat an Unlawful Secondary Picket Under Section 8(b)(k)(ii)(B) of the National Labor Relations Act?, </em>28 Cardozo L.R. 1519, 1533 &amp; n. 89 (2006). \u201c[F]or example, if a group of union handbillers violate local ordinances that place constitutionally valid time, place, and manner restrictions on such activity, they will be subject to local sanctions even if they do not violate the NLRA.\u201d <em>Ibid, </em>(citing <em>Kovacs v. Cooper, </em>336 <em>U.S. </em>77, 69 <em>S.Ct. </em>448, 93 <em>L.Ed. </em>513 (1949) (upholding the application of Trenton Ordinance No. 430(4), limiting loud noises to a sound truck publicizing a labor dispute)).</p>\n<p id=\"b64-7\">Primary jurisdiction preemption is subject to exceptions for \u201cdeeply rooted\u201d local interests. In <em>Garmon, </em>the Supreme Court recognized that the principles it announced were so broad, that they must yield to activity regulated that is merely peripheral to the federal concerns, or where the states\u2019 need to regulate certain conduct was so obvious that one would not infer that Congress meant to displace the states\u2019 power. <em>Garmon, supra, </em>359 <em>U.S. </em>at 243-244, 79 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 779, 3 L.Ed.2d at 782. In <em>Brown v. Hotel &amp; Rest. Employees &amp; Bartenders Int. Union Local 54, </em>468 <em>U.S. </em>491, 502, 104 <em>S.Ct. </em>3179, 3186, 82 L.Ed.2d 373, 384 (1984), the Court noted the following examples of \u201cdeeply rooted\u201d local interests are: \u201cbreach of contract actions by strike replacements, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number><em>Belknap, Inc. v. Hale, </em>463 <em>U.S. </em>491[, 103 <em>S.Ct </em>3172, 77 L.Ed.2d 798] (1983), state trespass actions, <em>Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co. v. [San Diego County Dist. Council of] Carpenters, </em>436 <em>U.S. </em>180[, 98 <em>S.Ct. </em>1745, 56 L.Ed.2d 209] (1978), or state tort remedies for intentional infliction of emotional distress, <em>Farmer v.

Implement Workers of Am. v. Wisconsin Employment Relations Bd., </em>351 <em>U.S. </em>266, 76 <em>S.Ct. </em>794, 100 <em>L.Ed. </em>1162 (1956) (upholding the order directing union and certain of its members to cease activities which included mass picketing that obstructed ingress to and egress from plant and interfered with the free and uninterrupted use of public ways); <em>Allen-Bradley Local 1111 v. Wisconsin Employment Relations Bd., </em>315 <em>U.S. </em>740, 749, 62 <em>S.Ct. </em>820, 86 <em>L.Ed. </em>1154 (1942) (agreeing that the NLRA is not designed to preclude a state from enacting legislation limited to the prohibition or regulation of such employee or union activity as mass picketing, obstructing ingress to and egress from the company\u2019s factory, and obstructing the streets and public roads surrounding the factory); <em>accord Cotton Belt R.R. v. Hendricks, </em>768 S.W.2d 865, 868 (Tex.App.1989); <em>see also Int\u2019l Union, United Auto., Aircraft &amp; Agric. Implement Workers of Am. v. Russell, </em>356 <em>U.S. </em>634, 78 <em>S.Ct. </em>932, 2 L.Ed.2d 1030 (1958) (noting a strike, which involved a picket line along and in the public street which was the only means of ingress to and egress from the plant, was conducted in such a manner that the state court could have enjoined it); <em>cf.

DeAngelo relies on numerous decisions in which a state law interjected itself to several different types of labor-management conflicts.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In those cases, the parties to the disputes have been the employer and the union, and the nub of the disputes have been whether there was an unfair labor practice. We agree that such disputes are subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the NLRB.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-7\">Here, the dispute is solely between the State and an individual, over the application of a local ordinance and does not concern an unfair labor practice per se. In our view, the proper forum for such a dispute is the state court system. It is settled that only when a state or local statute interjects itself into the economic balance between management and labor that such statutes or ordinances would be deemed subordinate to the NLRB. <em>Amalgamated Ass\u2019n of St. Elec. Ry. &amp; Motor Coach Employees, supra, </em>403 <em>U.S. </em>at 292, 91 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1920, 29 L.Ed.2d at 486. We are mindful that any distinction between state laws regulating labor relations and state laws of general application are irrelevant. <em>Weber v. Anheuser-Busch, </em>348 <em>U.S. </em>468, 478-79, 75 <em>S.Ct. </em>480, 486-87, 99 <em>L.Ed. </em>546, 556-57 (1955). Rather, \u201c[i]t is the conduct being regulated, not the formal description of the governing legal standards, that is the proper focus of concern.\u201d <em>Amalgamated Ass\u2019n of St. Elec. Ry. &amp; Motor Coach Employees, supra, </em>403 <em>U.S. </em>at 292, 91 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1922, 29 L.Ed.2d at 486.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>In this case, the conduct being regulated by the Ordinance is not the manner or scope of the union\u2019s labor action against Gold\u2019s Gym. The Ordinance does not interject itself into the economic balance between the union and Gold\u2019s Gym; nor does it regulate a field that Congress sought to regulate to the exclusion of the states or intended that it be unregulated altogether. Rather, the Ordinance is a prohibition that applies to all parties, including IBEW protesters, management, strikebreakers, and the general public. Moreover, the IBEW\u2019s ability to handbill is not curtailed. The IBEW message can get out to the passersby through handbills. The balloon is merely a means of getting the passersby\u2019s attention.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-5\">In addition, the Ordinance is a land use regulation, which is a primary function of municipal government, and a deeply rooted local interest. <em>See Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co., supra, </em>436 <em>U.S. </em>at 198, 98 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1758, 56 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 226 (finding that in permitting the trespass action to go forward in the state court would create \u201cno realistic risk of interference with the [NLRB\u2019s] primary jurisdiction to enforce the statutory prohibition against unfair labor practices.\u201d). Because the Ordinance here has little or no impact on the NLRA, the preemption doctrine should not apply. Therefore, we reject DeAngelo\u2019s argument that the Ordinance is preempted by the NLRA.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-6\">\n<em>Free Speech</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b67-7\">DeAngelo also contends that the Ordinance violates the light of free speech protected by the First Amendment of the United States Constitution because \u201cthe inflatable rat is symbolic non-commercial speech and the State\u2019s ability to limit such speech is sharply circumscribed because this speech occurred in the traditional public forum;\u201d and the \u201cOrdinance is a content-based regulation of free speech;\u201d and \u201cis not a valid time, place and manner restriction on free speech.\u201d We reject these arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-8\">A prior restraint refers to judicial and administrative orders that prevent entirely the expression of a message in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>advance before such communications could occur. <em>See Hamilton Amusement Ctr. v. Verniero, </em>156 <em>N.J. </em>254, 284-285, 716 A.2d 1137 (1998), <em>cert. denied, </em>527 <em>U.S. </em>1021, 119 <em>S.Ct. </em>2365, 144 L.Ed.2d 770 (1999); <em>see also Alexander v. United States, </em>509 <em>U.S. </em>544, 550, 113 <em>S.Ct. </em>2766, 2771, 125 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>441, 450 (1993). In <em>Freedman v. Maryland, </em>380 <em>U.S. </em>51, 56-57, 85 <em>S.Ct. </em>734, 738, 13 L.Ed.2d 649, 653 (1965), the Court held that prior restraints are presumptively unconstitutional, because of the likelihood that they will be used as a method of censoring unfavorable speech. However, in <em>Hamilton Amusement Ctr., supra, </em>156 <em>N.J. </em>at 284, 716 A.2d 1137, our Supreme Court noted that, \u201c[o]ne of the factors considered in determining if a restriction is a prior restraint is whether it prevents entirely the expression of a message.\u201d The Court explained that the statute does not prohibit plaintiffs from expressing their message entirely it just restricted the location. <em>Id. </em>at 284-85, 716 A.2d 1137.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-8\">The property in front of Gold\u2019s Gym is a \u201ctraditional public forum.\u201d <em>See Int\u2019l Union of Operating Eng\u2019rs, Local 150, supra, </em>139 F.Supp.2d at 958. In a traditional public forum, the State\u2019s power to limit expressive activity is limited. The government may enforce restrictions on the time, place or manner of speech even in a public forum. <em>See, e.g., Ward v. Rock Against Racism, </em>491 <em>U.S. </em>781, 791, 109 <em>S.Ct. </em>2746, 2753-54, 105 L.Ed.2d 661, 675 (1989). Such restrictions are valid if the regulation is: (1) content-neutral; (2) narrowly tailored to serve a significant government interest; and (3) leave open ample alternative channels for communicating the information. <em>Ibid, </em>(citation omitted). An ordinance is narrowly tailored only \u201cif it targets and eliminates no more than the exact source of the \u2018evil\u2019 it seeks to remedy.\u201d <em>Frisby v. Schultz, </em>487 <em>U.S. </em>474, 485, 108 <em>S.Ct. </em>2495, 2503, 101 L.Ed.2d 420, 432 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b68-9\">Applying these principles here, we conclude that the Ordinance\u2019s sign prohibition is not a restraint on free speech. First, the Ordinance is content-neutral. All inflatable signs, other than grand opening signs, are prohibited. DeAngelo contends <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>that the \u201cTownship has exhibited an explicit preference for commercial speech, i.e., inflatable grand opening signs, at the expense of all other inflatable signs.\u201d However, a regulation is considered content-neutral so long as it does not differentiate between different speakers or messages. <em>Int\u2019l Union of Operating Eng\u2019rs, Local 150, supra, </em>139 F.Supp.2d. at 959. \u201cIf neither the language nor the legislative history of the regulation suggests that one party\u2019s views may or should be preferred at the expense of another\u2019s, the restriction is content-neutral.\u201d <em>Ibid, </em>(citing White <em>House Vigil for the ERA Comm. v. Clark, </em>746 F.2d 1518, 1527 (D.C.Cir.1984)). Although the rule may incidentally affect one message or speaker more than another, that does not work against the content-neutral condition of the regulation provided that the regulation \u201cserves purposes unrelated to the content of [the] expression.\u201d <em>Ibid, </em>(quoting <em>Ward, supra, </em>491 <em>U.S. </em>at 791, 109 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2754, 105 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 675 (citation omitted)). The government\u2019s purpose is the controlling consideration. <em>Ibid. </em>Here, it is obvious that the local government wants to foster new businesses within its boundaries as they start up. We conclude that this one exemption for balloon signs is not a violation of the First Amendment that renders the Ordinance void.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-6\">Second, from our review, we conclude that the Ordinance is narrowly tailored. The purpose of the Ordinance is to enhance the aesthetics and protect public health and safety.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Obviously an inflatable sign that attracts the attention of pedestrians and motorist, also distracts them.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-7\">Third, we note that enforcement of the Ordinance does not \u201cprevent entirely\u201d the communication of IBEW\u2019s message. As <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>stated before, the IBEW\u2019s grievance against Gold\u2019s Gym is, presumably, conveyed by the handbills, any conversation between the protesters and the public and by the obvious fact that there is an ongoing demonstration. The balloon itself, merely attracts attention to the protesters.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-5\">Moreover, the court may uphold an ordinance if it finds that it is <em>\u201cnecessary </em>to serve a compelling state interest and it is narrowly drawn to achieve that end.\u201d <em>Perry Educ. Ass\u2019n v. Perry Local Educators\u2019 Ass\u2019n, </em>460 <em>U.S. </em>37, 46, 103 <em>S.Ct. </em>948, 955, 74 L.Ed.2d 794, 805 (1983). As stated before, public health and safety are compelling state interests. <em>Eastern Bergen County Bd. of Realtors, Inc. v. Borough of Fort Lee, </em>720 <em>F.Supp. </em>51 (D.N.J.1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b70-6\">\n<em>Void For Vagueness</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b70-7\">DeAngelo also contends that the Ordinance is void for vagueness because it does not define the term \u201csign,\u201d which it seeks to regulate. An individual of ordinary intellect would be required to enter the realm of guesswork in order to deduce that an inflatable rat is a \u201csign.\u201d This, he argues, is a deprivation of due process, i.e., lack of notice and warning that their conduct is subject ,to criminal charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-8\">In <em>Town of Kearny v. Modern Transp. Co., </em>116 <em>N.J.Super. </em>526, 529, 283 A.2d 119 (App.Div.1971), this court determined that prosecutions for violations of municipal ordinances are criminal in nature. <em>See also State v. Barnes, </em>168 <em>N.J.Super. </em>311, 314, 403 A.2d 7 (App.Div.1979), <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds, </em>84 <em>N.J. </em>362, 420 A.2d 303 (1980). Furthermore, this court held that an ordinance must be \u201cclear and unambiguous\u201d so that people of ordinary intellect do not need to guess at its meaning. <em>Kearny, supra, </em>116 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 529, 283 A.2d 119. \u201cBecause municipal court proceedings to prosecute violations of ordinances are essentially criminal in nature, the Court should follow the rule of strict construction interpreting the terms of the ordinance narrowly.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number><em>Twp. of Pennsauken v. Schad, </em>160 <em>N.J. </em>156, 171, 733 A.2d 1159 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b71-6\">Both federal and New Jersey constitutions render vague laws unenforceable. <em>See U.S. Const., </em>Amend. V; <em>N.J. Const. </em>Art. I, 1f 1 (1947). <em>State v. Cameron, </em>100 <em>N.J. </em>586, 498 A.2d 1217 (1985), provides an overview of the standards to be considered in deciding whether a law is vague and unenforceable:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b71-7\">[t]he terms of an ordinance must enable a person of \u201ccommon intelligence, in light of ordinary experience\u201d to understand whether contemplated conduct is lawful. The determination of vagueness must be made against the contextual background of the particular law and with a firm under-standing of its purpose.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b71-11\"><em>[Id. </em>at 591, 498 <em>A.2d </em>1217 (citation omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b71-12\">Quasi-criminal cases fall within the category of penal laws, which are subjected to sharper scrutiny than civil enactments. <em>Id. </em>at 594, 498 A.2d 1217.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-13\">Applying those principles here, we conclude that the Ordinance is not facially vague. It lists the types of signs it restricts, which includes balloon signs and inflated signs. A person of ordinary intellect would be advised which signs were prohibited.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-14\">\n<em>Selective Enforcement</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b71-15\">DeAngelo contends that the Ordinance has been selectively enforced against labor unions. We disagree because the record does not support that contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-16\">In <em>Twp. of Pennsauken, supra, </em>160 <em>N.J. </em>at 171, 733 A.2d 1159, the Court held that \u201c[i]n order to establish unconstitutional enforcement of the ordinance, defendant must show both a discriminatory effect and a motivating discriminatory purpose.\u201d <em>Ibid, </em>(citation omitted). The municipality, however, \u201cis afforded broad discretion to decide whom to prosecute based on such factors as strength of ease and general deterrence value.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>\u201cThe conscious exercise of some selectivity in enforcement is not a constitutional violation unless the decision to prosecute is based upon an unjustifiable standard such as race, religion, or other arbitrary classification.\u201d <em>Ibid, </em>(citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b72-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>Here, the only proofs that DeAngelo relies on are: (1) in 2004, the Lawrence Township Police were called to a dealership regarding the rat and the investigation resulted in \u201cno violations;\u201d and (2) in 2005, a large inflated balloon was utilized and an individual observed an officer approach the display with issuing a summons or a warning. These proofs are insufficient to meet his burden.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-6\">Accordingly, DeAngelo\u2019s conviction for violating the Ordinance is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b63-9\"> Commonly referred to as conflict preemption.

In particular, the ordinance exempts a discrete form of commercial speech\u2014 inflated signs with \u201cgrand opening\u201d messages \u2014 while prohibiting non-commercial signs and other commercial advertising. That content discrimination requires, at the very least, a remand for further development of the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-10\">The First Amendment of the United States Constitution proscribes content-based laws restricting speech unless those laws are demonstrated \u201cnecessary to serve a compelling state interest and ... narrowly drawn to achieve that end.\u201d <em>Boos v. Barry, </em>485 <em>U.S. </em>312, 321, 108 <em>S.Ct. </em>1157, 1164, 99 L.Ed.2d 333, 345 (1988) (citing <em>Perry Educ. Ass\u2019n v. Perry Local Educators\u2019 Ass\u2019n, </em>460 <em>U.S. </em>37, 45, 103 <em>S.Ct. </em>948, 955, 74 L.Ed.2d 794, 805 (1983)). Such heightened scrutiny stems from a constitutional presumption that \u201cgovernmental regulation of the content of speech is more likely to interfere with the free exchange of ideas than to encourage it.\u201d <em>Reno v. ACLU, </em>521 <em>U.S. </em>844, 885, 117 <em>S.Ct. </em>2329, 2351, 138 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number><em>L.Ed.2d </em>874, 906 (1997). \u201cThe interest in encouraging freedom of expression in a democratic society outweighs any theoretical but unproven benefit of censorship.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b73-6\">The municipal sign ordinance challenged in this case contains special provisions for commercial displays touting \u201cgrand openings,\u201d establishments \u201cunder new management\u201d and \u201cbusiness relocations.\u201d Lawrence Township, N.J., Mun. Ordinance \u00a7 534(K)(2) (1998). Specifically, the pertinent section of the ordinance forbids \u201cportable signs; balloon signs or other inflated signs <em>0excepting grand opening </em>signs); and searchlights <em>(excepting grand opening </em>signs), displayed for the purpose of attracting the attention of pedestrians and motorists; unless otherwise excepted.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 535(L)(2)(emphasis added). Defendant\u2019s inflated rat balloon was unquestionably displayed to draw the attention of pedestrians and motorists by Gold\u2019s Gym, and there is no claim that the balloon was \u201cotherwise excepted\u201d under the ordinance.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-7\">Although I agree that the ordinance\u2019s special treatment of commercial grand opening balloons is not \u201cviewpoint\u201d discrimination, which would require an extraordinary justification to satisfy the First Amendment, <em>see R.A.V. v. City of St. Paul, </em>505 <em>U.S. </em>377, 395, 112 <em>S.Ct. </em>2538, 2550, 120 L.Ed.2d 305, 325-26 (1992), I disagree with my colleagues that the balloon provision is content-neutral. If, hypothetically, Gold\u2019s Gym had hoisted an inflated sign, having the same dimensions as defendant\u2019s balloon, to promote the opening of its business, no summons would have issued.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b73-8\">For reasons that are not clear on the present record, the ordinance favors a discrete form of commercial speech. The temporary nature of a grand opening provides no useful distinction. Although the grand opening of a business is a short-term event, so was the one-day labor protest organized by defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>and his union. It is not readily apparent how the rat balloon involved in this ease could have been significantly more harmful to traffic, safety or aesthetics than a large balloon with an eye-catching ad or a commercial logo.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-6\">In <em>Metromedia, Inc. v. City of San Diego, </em>453 <em>U.S. </em>490, 513, 101 <em>S.Ct. </em>2882, 2895, 69 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>800, 818 (1981), a plurality of the United States Supreme Court determined that, absent a compelling justification, an ordinance may not prohibit or restrict noncommercial outdoor signs while allowing comparable commercial signs. These free-speech principles have been applied by several federal and state courts in invalidating, in full or in part, laws or regulations that exempt \u201cgrand opening\u201d displays from prohibitions or restrictions covering non-commercial displays. <em>See, e.g., Solantic, LLC v. City of Neptune Beach, </em>410 F.3d 1250 (11th Cir.2005); <em>Rappa v. New Castle County, </em>18 F.3d 1043 (3d Cir.1994); <em>Nat\u2019l Advertising Co. v. Town of Babylon, </em>900 <em>F.2d </em>551 (2d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>498 <em>U.S. </em>852, 111 <em>S.Ct. </em>146, 112 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>112 (1990); <em>Nat\u2019l Advertising Co. v. City of Orange, </em>861 <em>F.2d </em>246 (9th Cir.1988); <em>Adams Outdoor Adver. v. Newport News, </em>236 <em>Va. </em>370, 373 <em>S.E.2d </em>917 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b74-7\">The Law Division judge was under the misapprehension that the ordinance was content-neutral and did- not focus on the disparity for grand opening signs. Additionally, the record was not adequate to determine if the municipality has sufficiently compelling reasons to justify its content-based balloon regulation. Moreover, the record is inadequate for us to consider fairly whether the grand opening exemption in the ordinance, if it is indeed unconstitutional, reasonably can be severed from the sign ordinance without unduly compromising the aims of the ordinance.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-8\">For all of these reasons, I dissent in part from the majority opinion and would remand the matter for further proceedings on the First Amendment issues.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b73-9\"> Likewise, if a Disney retail store had just opened in the township, it could have promoted its wares for the grand opening with a rat-shaped balloon depicting the latest popular animated Disney character, from the movie \"Ratatouille.\"</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
