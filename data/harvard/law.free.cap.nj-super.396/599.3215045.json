The Board determined that \u201cthe ALJ erroneously concluded that Petitioner met his burden by satisfying <em>N.J.S.A. </em>45:15A-43 to permit the filing of his application beyond the 5 year statutory limitation.\u201d That statute permits a filing for an accidental disability pension beyond the five year limitation period \u201cdue to a delayed manifestation.\u201d The relevant portion of the statute provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b631-6\">The application to accomplish such retirement must be filed within five years of the original traumatic event, but the board of trustees may consider an application filed after the five-year period if it can be factually demonstrated to the satisfaction of the board of trustees that the disability is due to the accident and <em>the filing was not accomplished within the five-year peiiod due to a delayed ma,nifestation of the disability </em>or to circumstances beyond the control of the member.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b631-7\"><em>[N.J.S.A. </em>43:15A-43 (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b631-8\">As the Board accepted the ALJ\u2019s factual findings and the \u201conly issue\u201d before the Board was \u201cwhether the requirements of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>43:15A-43 [were] satisfied to permit filing of an application beyond the 5-year statutory limitation,\u201d the issue before us is essentially one of law to which the Board is entitled to limited deference. <em>See Mayflower Secs. v. Bureau of Secs., 64 N.J. </em>85, 93, 312 A.2d 497 (1973); <em>see also Thurber v. City of Burlington, </em>191 <em>N.J. </em>487, 501-02, 924 A.2d 533 (2007). Once the issue of statutory construction is resolved, the question of factual application must also be addressed. <em>See, e.g., Thurber, supra, </em>191 <em>N.J. </em>at 501-02, 924 A.2d 533; <em>Campbell v. Dep\u2019t of Civil Serv., </em>39 <em>N.J. </em>556, 562, 189 A.2d 712 (1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b631-9\">The critical facts related to the filing were stipulated before the ALJ, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b631-10\">1. Petitioner, Anthony Crimaldi, was born on October 4, 1946, and was employed by the Hazlet Board of Education.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>2. He was enrolled in the Public Employees\u2019 Retirement System (\u201cPERS\u201d.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-5\">3. On December 16, 2002, Petitioner filed an application for disability retirement for an accident which occurred on August 5, 1994. Additionally, he requested an effective date of retirement of May 1, 2001. However, as the application was not received until the middle of December 2002, the first effective date of any benefit to which he may be entitled was January 1, 2003. As such, the staff at the Division of Pensions and Benefits changed the date. (Joint Exhibit 1 \u2014 application for disability retirement.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-6\">4. The Petitioner submitted an employer\u2019s first report of accidental injury or occupational illness describing the accident of August 5, 1994, wherein he slipped while descending a ladder. (Joint Exhibit 2.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-7\">5. By letter dated May 17, 2000, the Board of Education in Hazlet Township notified Mr. Crimaldi that it would not renew his contract for the 2000-2001 school year. This recommendation from the Superintendent of Schools and the School Business Administrator was based upon Mi-. Crimaldi\u2019s attendance record for the past few years and his continued inability to perform the work required as a maintenance worker in the school district. (Joint Exhibit 3.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-8\">6. At its August 20, 2003, meeting the PERS Board of Trustees denied Petitioner\u2019s application for an accidental disability retirement allowance on the grounds that he did not file his application within five years of the original traumatic event. The Board noted that it may consider an application filed after the five-year period if it can be factually demonstrated to the satisfaction of the Board that the disability was due to the accident and the filing was not accomplished within the five-year period due to a delayed manifestation of the disability or to circumstances beyond the control of the member. Consequently, the Board could find no evidence to support that he failed to file within the requisite five-year period due to delayed manifestation and denied his application on solely that basis. (Joint Exhibit 4.) At the time that this correspondence was drafted, Petitioner did not have enough time in the retirement system to qualify for an ordinary disability retirement benefit, even though he had been found to be totally and permanently disabled. Once the employer had made the requisite contributions based upon Petitioner\u2019s Workers\u2019 Compensation matter, the ordinary disability was granted.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-9\">7. Petitioner\u2019s counsel wrote to the Board of Trustees of the Public Employees\u2019 Retirement System by letter dated August 26, 2003, to appeal the decision of the PERS Board regarding this denial and thereby request a formal hearing before the Office of Administrative law. (Joint Exhibit 5.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-10\">8. On September 18, 2003, the Board of Trustees of PERS wrote to both the Office of Administrative law as well as the Petitioner granting Petitioner\u2019s request for an administrative hearing, thereby transmitting the Petitioner\u2019s file to the OAL. (Joint Exhibit 6.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b632-11\">The ALJ then added the following findings of fact which are substantially uncontested:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-12\">Mr. Crimaldi worked for the Hazlet Board of Education (\u201cHazlet\u201d) as a maintenance mechanic when he was injured in the accident of August 1994. As a result of the accident he injured vertebrae, separated both shoulders, suffered neck trauma, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>broke his eoeeyx and his wrist. He received Workers\u2019 Compensation and was out of work for one year, during which he had a spinal fusion. After he returned he was again out of work due to another surgery and was out of work for another year, undergoing surgery to remove the hardware related to the fusion. Thereafter he had shoulder surgery and his coccyx was removed. He does not believe that he worked for 2 1/2 years in those five years following the accident. He suffered another accident at work in 1999 and underwent shoulder surgery as a result. His workers\u2019 compensation benefits ended in December 2000 or January 2001. At some point, apparently after May 2000, Mr. Crimaldi went to the pharmacy to get medication and was advised that his prescription plan was no longer valid. He called Hazlet and was advised that his contract had been canceled. In fact, as stipulated, Hazlet had determined as of May 17, 2000 not to renew Mr. Crimaldi\u2019s contract for the 2000-2001 school year due to his \u201ccontinued inability to perform the work required as a Maintenance Worker in the school district.\u201d Mr. Crimaldi denied having received this May 17 letter at that time, finally getting it in August or September.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b633-6\">Crimaldi explained that the doctor treating him for the 1994 accident did not release him from treatment until January 2001. When he learned of Hazlet\u2019s action, he needed to work and applied to Western Monmouth Utilities, where he worked from March 5 until sometime in April 2001. He could not perform that work and was not made a permanent employee. He continued to look for work and obtained a job as a supervisor at Kensington Court Apartments.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b633-7\">The member testified that in 2001 he called the Pension Board and was told by Kathleen Coates, who is currently the secretary of the PEES and then worked in client services involving benefits education and publications, that he did not have enough service time to qualify for an ordinary pension and that it was too late for him to file for an accidental disability pension. She did not advise that there were instances where \u201clate\u201d applications could be made.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b633-8\">Mr. Crimaldi insisted that during the time he was receiving treatment for the 1994 accident no doctor advised him that he could return to work. He always assumed that he would be returning to work with Hazlet. When he was released by the doctor in January 2001, he was told that he might require additional surgery on his shoulder, but he has not had to do so as of this date.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b633-9\">The application for an accidental disability pension was filed in December 2002 on the advice of counsel.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b633-10\">Kathleen Coates testified that while she did answer telephones as a telephone counselor in the late 1980s; she did not do so after February 1989, when she was transferred into work for the deferred compensation plan and then after, February, 1995, when she went back to client services until April 2000, she did not answer phones, as her work involved seminars and she was often on the road. She then worked in planning and research in the office of the Director of Pensions, developing a business plan for the Division of Pensions and Benefits. She had no telephone contact with members in this position. Although she is familiar with Mr. Grimaldi\u2019s case from telephone contacts in September 2003 with counsel for Mr. Crimaldi and later in January 2004 with Deputy Attorney General Culliton, she has no recollection of any telephone contact with Mr. Crimaldi between May and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>December of 2000. There is no policy to prevent members from filing applications after five years following an accident. She was comfortable with saying that she never advised Mr. Crimaldi that he could not file an application.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b634-5\">In this case there is agreement that petitioner suffered a \u201ctraumatic event\u201d during the course of employment, <em>see Richardson v. PFRS, </em>192 <em>N.J. </em>189, 927 A.2d 543 (2007), and that there was a \u201cdelayed manifestation.\u201d Therefore, we do not examine those questions. Nor is there a dispute that petitioner was ineligible for an ordinary disability until workers\u2019 compensation benefits were paid. The questions before us deal with when the \u201cmanifestation\u201d occurred and how long thereafter did petitioner have in which to file his application.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-6\">The AL J concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b634-7\">Of course, the statute itself does not speak to the question of how much time may pass after the delayed manifestation of a permanent and total disability before the filing of an application will be considered too late. The statute does provide that in the absence of delayed manifestation or cn\u2019cumstances beyond the control of the member, the period in which filing may timely occur is five years. Thus, even in the case of an immediate manifestation after the traumatic event of the most obvious examples of total and permanent disability, a member is given five years to file. But where the manifestation is delayed beyond that five year post-event period, the statute only says that the Board \u201cmay\u201d consider an application, it does not say how long after the manifestation the application must be filed. Given this lack of specificity as to the existence of an allowable time period for filing following a delayed manifestation, resort to a reasonableness standard is warranted. But how is reasonableness defined in this circumstance?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b634-8\">It seems most proper that the five year period allowed by the Legislature for filing after the disabling event be utilized as the measure for timely filing from the date of the manifestation of a disability. This allows a fixed and easily applied test for determining timeliness from the date of actual or chargeable knowledge that the member is indeed disabled. Any other measure of \u201creasonableness\u201d imports uncertainty into the process and can lead to discrimination against those whose disabilities are not manifest until after five years as against those whose permanent and total disability is apparent within the first five years.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b634-9\">Given the above, Mr. Crimaldi\u2019s permanent and total disability was not manifest until at least that time when the district told him he could no longer perform his job. This was arguably May 2001, but he claimed not to have received the letter until August or September. Even if one utilized the May date, this is the earliest date after the first five year period closed when manifestation can be found. Filing in December 2002 was well within five years of this date, and surely even more so if the date utilized as the point of manifestation is moved back to the date in April <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>2001, when Mr. Crimaldi learned that Western Monmouth would not make a permanent employee because it concluded that he could not perform the work.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b635-6\">The Board rejected the ALJ\u2019s reasoning because, although the AL J found that the application had to be filed within a \u201creasonable period,\u201d he concluded that it was \u201creasonable\u201d to file at any time within the five years after the manifestation. According to the Board, petitioner \u201cclearly knew of his disability by May 2001 when he was terminated from his second job\u201d which required that he act diligently thereafter. The Board also found that \u201cthe clear evidence is that Crimaldi knew or should have known that he was totally and permanently incapacitated from his duties as a custodian from the Hazlet Board of Education when the notice of non-renewal was sent on May 17, 2000,\u201d when his contract was not renewed thereafter, and when all medical treatment ceased in January 2001. Nevertheless, petitioner waited until December 16, 2002 before filing his claim. The Board concluded that petitioner proffered \u201cno justification for the delay of 1 1/2 to 2 years after the manifestation of his disability.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b635-7\">The appeal presents an interesting question, and petitioner argues that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-8\">N.J.S.A. 43U5A-43 allows an employee to file for an accidental disability within five (5) years from the date of the accident which gives rise to the disability but allows an employee to file after the five (5) year period if the employee can show that the disability is not manifested until more than five (5) years after the accident.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b635-9\">He further contends that even if he does not receive a full five years after the manifestation in which to file his claim, the Board was arbitrary and capricious in finding that his claim was not filed within a reasonable time. Hence, we must decide if the statute permits a filing for up to five years after the \u201cdelayed manifestation\u201d or for only a \u201creasonable period\u201d thereafter, and if the latter, whether the record supports the Board\u2019s finding that petitioner waited an \u201cunreasonable\u201d period of time.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-10\">We are satisfied that the statute gives the Board discretion to extend the filing deadline for specific reasons, and given that authority and the Board\u2019s obligation to protect the public purse, we agree with its construction of the statute that the filing for an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>accidental disability must be within a reasonable period after the physical manifestation beyond the five-year period.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b636-5\">In finding that Crimaldi did not file his claim within a reasonable period, the Board concluded that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b636-6\">Crimaldi had substantial absences from work due to his disability, he continued to undergo surgeries and receive treatment for these injuries and, because he could not perform the duties in May 2000, the employer notified Crimaldi that his employment contract would not be renewed. According to Crimaldi, this notice was received months later in December 2000, yet he admittedly did not return to work at the beginning of the contract term in September 2000. In January 2001, Crimaldi was released from medical treatment under the workers compensation claim. Thus, the clear evidence is that Crimaldi knew or should have known that he was totally and permanently incapacitated from his duties as a custodian for the Hazlet Board of Education when the notice of non-renewal was sent in May 17, 2000. This was reaffirmed again in September 2000 when actual employment under the new contract term did not commence and reaffirmed once more in January 2001 when all medical treatment ceased. Yet, the application for accidental disability was not filed until December 16, 2002 \u2014 nearly two years later. Even [the ALJ] concedes a 2-year delay might be considered unreasonable. (Initial Decision at 8). If the \u201cmanifestation\u201d of the disability is extended further and deemed to be April 2001 when Crimaldi was terminated by his second employer, Western Monmouth Utilities, a delay of 1 1/2 years still does not bring the filing of this claim within a reasonable time after manifestation of the disability. Thus, while Crimaldi is arguably entitled to some relaxation of the 5-year limitation so as to permit him to file an application for disability, he is obligated to do so promptly upon discovery of the disability and must file within a \u201creasonable time\u201d thereafter.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b636-7\">Here Crimaldi did not pursue his claim diligently and he proffers no justification for the delay of 1 1/2 to 2 years after the manifestation of his disability. The interests of all parties are best served by requiring members, especially those who are competent and fully aware of the occurrence of the accident such as Mr. Crimaldi was, to make timely claims. The totality of the undisputed facts and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>cix-eumstances in this ease support a conclusion that Mr. Crimaldi did not act diligently hex-e.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b637-6\">We believe a more fact-sensitive analysis is required as to when the delayed manifestation actually occurred, why the filing was delayed thereafter, and what prejudice would result to the PERS as a result of the late filing, in determining what was \u201creasonable\u201d <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> under the circumstances. The lack of clarity in the law with respect to petitioner\u2019s right to wait five years after the manifestation would also be relevant to the balance in this case. We also believe that, because injured workers would ordinarily seek disability benefits as soon as possible, permitting this delayed filing would not result in either the filing of many delayed claims or be inconsistent with the liberal purposes behind our laws providing for disability pensions. <em>See Geller v. Dept. of Treasury, </em>53 <em>N.J. </em>591, 252 A.2d 393 (1969); <em>Uricoli v. Board of Trustees, </em>91 <em>N.J. </em>62, 449 A.2d 1267 (1982). In any event, further consideration of these factors is warranted before the Board can determine that the petitioner\u2019s application was unreasonably late.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-7\">The final administrative determination is reversed, and the matter is remanded to the Board for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b636-8\"> We recognize that the ALJ\u2019s construction parallels the approach of the Supreme Court in its case law development of the time period in which to bring a personal injury action after \"discovery\u201d of an injury as a result of the fault of another, at least where the two-year statute of limitations has not yet expired at the time of discovery. <em>See, e.g., Abboud v. Viscomi, </em>111 <em>N.J. </em>56, 58, 543 A.2d 29 (1988) (first paragraph of Point I); <em>Vispisiano v.
