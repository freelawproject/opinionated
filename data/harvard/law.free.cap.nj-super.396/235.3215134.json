We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-13\">The facts, as reflected in the administrative record, are simple and essentially uncontroverted. Ries admits that he escaped from a halfway house known as Hope Hall on May 9, 2006. Several weeks later, on June 23, 2006, Ries was apprehended and taken to Riverfront State Prison. Upon his arrival at Riverfront, and as part of the routine protocol when an inmate is returned to a facility, Ries was ordered to provide a urine specimen to be tested for prohibited substances.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-14\">Ries\u2019s sample tested positive for cocaine and opiates. After the test results came back, Ries was charged with violating *.204 of the Department\u2019s disciplinary regulations, as codified at <em>NJA.C. </em>10A:4-4.1. Ries appeared at the hearing with a counsel substitute. His defense was that he felt pressured to use drugs while he was on the run, and that he had not used drugs while confined within the prison walls. Ries called no witnesses, and did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>contest the chain of custody or the accuracy of his positive drug test.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-5\">The hearing officer found Ries guilty of the drug violation, relying upon the Department\u2019s unrefuted proofs. The hearing officer rejected Ries\u2019s claim that he was outside of the authority of prison officials while he was on escape status. The hearing officer recommended sanctions of ten days detention, 185 days of lost commutation time, 185 days of administrative segregation, 365 days of urine monitoring, and the permanent loss of contact visits. After Ries filed an internal appeal, a Department Administrator upheld the guilty finding in a July 3, 2006 final agency decision. However, the Administrator modified the punishment, suspending the detention sanction for thirty days and the administrative segregation for sixty days.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-6\">Ries argues on appeal that the Department exceeded the scope of its authority by disciplining him for drug use that occurred while he was on escape status. He also contends that there was insufficient evidence to support the finding of his guilt, and that the elimination of his contact visit privileges was too severe a sanction. None of these arguments have merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-7\">Ries\u2019s jurisdictional claim overlooks the fact that during the time that he was unconfined, following his escape from the halfway house, he still remained subject to the legal custody and authority of the Commissioner of Corrections. <em>See </em>N.J.S.A 30:lB-6 (reciting the powers and duties of the Commissioner). The Department of Corrections is entrusted with the legal authority, among other things, \u201cto provide for the custody, care, discipline, training and treatment of adult offenders committed to State correctional institutions or on parole[.]\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>30:lB-3. To carry out those responsibilities, the Commissioner is empowered to adopt rules and regulations. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>30:lB-24. Those regulations include the disciplinary provisions, and various enumerated infractions, set forth in <em>IV./.A.C. </em>10A:4-4.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>Unquestionably, Ries continued to be an \u201cadult offender [] committed to State correctional institutions\u201d after he escaped from the halfway house. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>30:1 B-3. His temporary, self-initiated departure from the Department\u2019s physical custody did not divest it of legal custody over him. Indeed, the Commissioner\u2019s authority extends to convicted offenders who are physically outside the walls of a prison, such as parolees, inmates on work release programs, and inmates who are granted special permission to receive outside medical care, visit dying relatives, attend funerals, or meet with prospective employers. <em>See, e.g., N.J.S.A. </em>30:lB-3 (including persons \u201con parole\u201d as within the Department\u2019s jurisdiction); <em>N.J.S.A. </em>30:4-91.3 (authorizing the Commissioner to extend the limits of the place of confinement for a variety of \u201ccompelling reason[s] consistent with the public interest\u201d). Otherwise, public safety would be endangered if the Commissioner could not assert legal authority over a prisoner who escaped, a parolee who had not accounted for his or her whereabouts, or an inmate on work release or out of confinement for some other approved purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-6\">Further, the Commissioner has a valid interest in assuring that offenders who are committed to his care and custody do not ingest controlled dangerous substances, whether they do so inside or outside the confines of a penal facility. Such illegal drug activity not only can pose dangers to the public, but it also can interfere with the penological objectives of treatment and rehabilitation that are expressed in the Department\u2019s enabling statutes and its regulations. <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>30:lB-3 (identifying the \u201ctreatment\u201d and \u201crehabilitation\u201d of prisoners as within the Department\u2019s statutory mission); <em>see also N.J.A.C. </em>10A:1-1.1 (noting the Department\u2019s obligation to, among other things, provide for the \u201ctreatment of persons committed to State correctional facilities\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b269-7\">Accordingly, we reject Ries\u2019s contention that his *.204 infraction must be vacated because he ingested cocaine and opiates while he was on escape status. The Department\u2019s rejection of that jurisdictional claim is sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>We likewise reject Ries\u2019s assertion on appeal that his guilt was not supported by substantial credible evidence. To the contrary, the proofs, including the positive drug tests, are unassailable. The Department\u2019s final decision clearly met the proof standards for administrative adjudication. <em>See Henry v. Rahway State Prison, </em>81 <em>N.J. </em>571, 579, 410 A.2d 686 (1980). The hearing procedures also comported with the applicable norms of due process. <em>See Avant v. Clifford, </em>67 <em>N.J. </em>496, 341 A.2d 629 (1975); <em>see also McDonald, v. Pinchak, </em>139 <em>N.J. </em>188, 652 A.2d 700 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b270-4\">Lastly, we affirm the denial of contact visits to Ries as a permissible sanction within the discretion of the Commissioner. In that regard, we note that it is well settled that \u201ca prisoner does not have a due process right to unfettered visitation.\u201d <em>Jackson v. Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>335 <em>N.J.Super. </em>227, 235, 762 A.2d 255 (App.Div.2000), <em>certif. denied, </em>167 <em>N.J. </em>630, 772 A.2d 932 (2001). The imposition of such a sanction here, given the nature of Ries\u2019s wrongful conduct and also the risk that outsiders might attempt to supply drugs to him during visitations, was neither arbitrary nor capricious.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
