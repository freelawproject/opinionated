It is well settled that \u201ctax returns are generally not discoverable in the absence of a strong showing that the information is indispensable to the claim and cannot be obtained from other sources\u201d <em>(Latture v Smith, </em>304 AD2d 534, 536 [2003]; <em>see Gordon v Grossman, </em>183 AD2d 669 [1992]; <em>Briand Parenteau, Inc. v Dean Witter Reynolds, </em>267 AD2d 576 [1999]; <em>Nanbar Realty Corp. v Pater Realty Co., </em>242 AD2d 208 [1997]; <em>Grossman v Lacoff, </em>168 AD2d 484 [1990]). The defendant failed to make such a showing. Moreover, the defendant failed to demonstrate the existence of special circumstances <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>warranting disclosure of the plaintiffs tax returns in this case <em>(cf. Dore v Allstate Indem. Co., </em>264 AD2d 804 [1999]). In addition, under the circumstances of this case, the plaintiff\u2019s monthly bank statements are not material and necessary to the defense of this action <em>(see </em>CPLR 3101 [a]; <em>Manzella v Provident Life &amp; Cas. Co., </em>273 AD2d 923 [2000]). Cozier, J.P., Krausman, Mastro and Fisher, JJ., concur. <em>[See </em>4 Misc 3d 1007(A), 2004 NY Slip Op 50753(11).]</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
