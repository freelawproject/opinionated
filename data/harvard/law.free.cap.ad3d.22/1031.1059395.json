Glownia, J.), entered November 12, 2004 in a personal injury action. The order granted plaintiffs motion for partial summary judgment on liability pursuant to Labor Law \u00a7 240 (1) and denied defendant\u2019s cross motion for summary judgment dismissing the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b1061-10\">It is hereby ordered that the order so appealed from be and the same hereby is unanimously modified on the law by denying the motion and as modified the order is affirmed without costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b1061-11\">Memorandum: Plaintiff commenced this action to recover damages for injuries he sustained when he allegedly fell \u201cfrom a scaffold to a lower level\u201d on property owned by defendant. Following discovery, plaintiff moved for partial summary judgment on liability on the Labor Law \u00a7 240 (1) claim, contending that defendant violated that section of the Labor Law and that the violation was a proximate cause of plaintiffs fall. Defendant cross-moved for summary judgment dismissing the complaint. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1032\">*1032</page-number>Although we conclude that Supreme Court properly denied defendant\u2019s cross motion, we agree with defendant that the court erred in granting plaintiff\u2019s motion, and we therefore modify the order accordingly. We note at the outset that defendant has failed to address on appeal the denial of that part of its cross motion with respect to the Labor Law \u00a7 241 (6) claim and thus has abandoned its appeal with respect thereto <em>(see Ciesinski v Town of Aurora, </em>202 AD2d 984 [1994]).</p>\n<p id=\"b1062-3\">We reject the contention of defendant that it cannot be liable under Labor Law \u00a7 240 (1) because it did not contract for the work being performed on its property. Generally, liability under Labor Law \u00a7 240 (1) \u201crests upon the fact of ownership and whether [the owner] had contracted for the work or benefitted from it are legally irrelevant\u201d <em>(Gordon v Eastern Ry. Supply, </em>82 NY2d 555, 560 [1993]). The further contention of defendant that it cannot be liable under section 240 (1) because it neither directed nor controlled the work also is without merit. The statute expressly limits that exception to owners of one- and two-family dwellings, and it is undisputed that the property at issue here is not a one- or two-family dwelling. Moreover, defendant\u2019s reliance on <em>Abbatiello v Lancaster Studio Assoc. </em>(3 NY3d 46 [2004]) is misplaced. In that case, the owner was \u201cwholly unaware\u201d that the injured plaintiff was working on the property, and thus the owner was not held liable under section 240 (1) <em>(id. </em>at 52). Defendant\u2019s reliance on <em>Albanese v City of New York </em>(5 NY3d 217 [2005]) is also misplaced because, in that case, the only role of defendant City of New York (City) in the expressway reconstruction project undertaken by the State on expressways within the City was to issue work permits authorizing the State \u201cto \u2018enter upon and restrict the flow of traffic on the [affected interchanges]\u2019 \u201d <em>(id. </em>at 219). Here, defendant entered into a license agreement with the United States Department of Energy to perform remediation on its premises, and defendant and the United States Department of Energy agreed to enter into a \u201cmutually acceptable remedial action plan\u201d including \u201ca detailed narrative of planned activities, a work schedule, and provisions for reimbursement to [defendant]\u201d with respect to buildings or facilities damaged or demolished as a result of the United States Department of Energy\u2019s activities.</p>\n<p id=\"b1062-4\">Defendant contends in the alternative that the court erred in granting plaintiffs motion because there is a triable issue of fact whether plaintiff fell. \u201c[P]laintiff s account of the accident was uncontroverted, and the defendant has not offered any evidence, other than mere speculation, to call into question the plaintiffs credibility\u201d <em>(Masiello v Belcastro, </em>237 AD2d 335, 335 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1033\">*1033</page-number>[1997]). Thus, there is no \u201cbona fide\u201d issue with respect to plaintiffs credibility <em>(Wasilewski v Museum of Modern Art, </em>260 AD2d 271, 272 [1999]; <em>see Wittkopp v ADF Constr. Corp., </em>254 AD2d 775, 776 [1998]; <em>cf. Barber v Kennedy Gen. Contrs., </em>302 AD2d 718, 719-720 [2003]).</p>\n<p id=\"b1063-4\">We nevertheless agree with defendant that the court erred in granting plaintiffs motion. \u201cTo establish entitlement to judgment on liability under Labor Law \u00a7 240 (1), \u2018[a] worker injured by a fall from an elevated worksite must . . . prove that the absence of or defect in a safety device was [a] proximate cause of his or her injuries\u2019 \u201d <em>(Baum v Ciminelli-Cowper Co., </em>300 AD2d 1028, 1029 [2002], quoting <em>Felker v Corning Inc., </em>90 NY2d 219, 224 [1997]). Even assuming, arguendo, that plaintiff established that a defect in the scaffold or \u201cthe absence of any other safety device was a proximate cause of the accident\u201d <em>(Loveless v American Ref-fuel Co. of Niagara, </em>299 AD2d 819, 820 [2002]; <em>see generally Plass v Solotoff, </em>283 AD2d 474 [2001]; <em>Grogan v Norlite Corp., </em>282 AD2d 781, 782 [2001]), we conclude that defendant raised triable issues of fact \u201cwhether the safety device! ] provided [to plaintiff] afforded proper protection\u201d <em>(Kumar v Stahlunt Assoc., </em>3 AD3d 330, 330 [2004]; <em>see Weber v 1111 Park Ave. Realty Corp., </em>253 AD2d 376, 377-378 [1998]) and whether plaintiffs actions in disregarding safety instructions and stepping on a guardrail were the \u201c \u2018sole proximate cause\u2019 of the accident\u201d <em>(Blake v Neighborhood Hous. Servs. of N.Y. City, </em>1 NY3d 280, 290 [2003]; <em>see Montgomery v Federal Express Corp., </em>4 NY3d 805, 806 [2005]; <em>Cahill v Triborough Bridge &amp; Tunnel Auth., 4 </em>NY3d 35, 39-40 [2004]; <em>Makaj v Metropolitan Transp. Auth., </em>18 AD3d 625 [2005]). Present\u2014Pigott, Jr., P.J., Hurlbutt, Gorski, Pine and Hayes, JJ.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
