He was charged with felony possession of a controlled substance with intent to sell, felony possession of more than 16 ounces of marijuana, and misdemeanor possession of marijuana. The drugs were found in respondent\u2019s car, which was seized and vouchered at the time of arrest and is the subject of a civil forfeiture proceeding. Respondent thereafter filed a timely demand with petitioner for a <em>Krimstock </em>hearing <em>(Krimstock v Kelly, </em>306 F3d 40 [2d Cir 2002], <em>cert denied </em>539 US 969 [2003]), which was held on March 8, 2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-9\">In support of its application to retain possession of respondent\u2019s vehicle pending forfeiture, petitioner submitted respondent\u2019s arrest report which stated he was \u201cin possession\u201d of marijuana and other controlled substances. It also submitted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>the Criminal Court complaint which stated that the arresting officer observed respondent in the vehicle in question and that the marijuana and other controlled substances were recovered from that vehicle. Documents demonstrating the value of the vehicle, respondent\u2019s ownership thereof, and respondent\u2019s prior criminal record were also submitted at the hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-4\">Respondent testified at the hearing that at the time of his arrest, his vehicle was parked and he was arrested after he exited his vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-5\">With respect to the issue of probable cause for respondent\u2019s arrest, petitioner argued that probable cause existed because the marijuana and other drugs were recovered from the vehicle. When the Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) presiding at the hearing inquired about the arresting officer\u2019s observations leading to the initial stop of respondent, petitioner argued that the issue of whether there was reasonable suspicion for the initial stop was beyond the scope of the hearing. The ALJ disagreed, holding that if the initial stop was invalid, the subsequent arrest and seizure were also invalid, despite the quality of the evidence recovered as a result of the illegal stop. He concluded that since there was no indication of the factual basis for the initial stop of respondent by the arresting officer, the vehicle must be released.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-6\">Petitioner thereafter brought a CPLR article 78 proceeding, arguing that the ALJ acted beyond his jurisdiction in requiring proof of the propriety of the initial stop. The IAS court determined that the ALJ was correct in his analysis that the initial stop must be valid to sustain the subsequent seizure, and denied the petition and dismissed the proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-7\">Administrative Code of the City of New York \u00a7 14-140 (b) provides that all property \u201csuspected of having been used as a means of committing crime or employed in aid or furtherance of crime . . . shall be given . . . into the custody of and kept by the property clerk.\u201d Section 14-140 (e) (1) states that a person who uses property in aid of a crime shall not be considered the lawful claimant entitled to that property <em>(see Matter of Property Clerk of N.Y. City Police Dept. v Ferris, </em>77 NY2d 428, 430 [1991]).</p>\n<p id=\"b232-8\"><em>Krimstock v Kelly </em>(306 F3d 40 [2002], supra) examined the Administrative Code provisions relating to seizure of vehicles and promulgated the minimal standards of due process to be followed in seizure cases. A brief review of <em>Krimstock </em>is warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-9\">All the plaintiffs in <em>Krimstock </em>had been arrested for driving while intoxicated (DWI) and had their vehicles seized and retained as instrumentalities of a crime pursuant to Administra<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>tive Code \u00a7 14-140. They commenced a class action in the Southern District of New York challenging the constitutionality of the forfeiture statute and seeking injunctive relief, alleging that the statute violated their due process rights since it did not provide for a prompt, postseizure hearing where they could challenge the retention of their vehicles during the pendency of the forfeiture proceeding. The District Court dismissed the complaint, but the Second Circuit reversed, holding that \u201cdue process of law requires that plaintiffs be afforded a prompt post-seizure, pre-judgment hearing before a neutral judicial or administrative officer to determine whether the City is likely to succeed on the merits of the forfeiture action and whether means short of retention of the vehicle can satisfy the City\u2019s need to preserve it from destruction or sale during the pendency of the proceedings\u201d (306 F3d at 67). The court further held that \u201cat a minimum, the hearing must enable claimants to test the probable validity of continued deprivation of their vehicles, including the City\u2019s probable cause for the initial warrantless seizure\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 69).</p>\n<p id=\"b233-4\">On remand, the District Court incorporated the Second Circuit\u2019s holding and established the basic parameters for a <em>Krimstock </em>hearing. The hearing magistrate must, at a minimum, determine (1) whether probable cause existed for the arrest of the vehicle operator; (2) whether it is likely the Property Clerk will prevail in a forfeiture action; and (3) whether continued impoundment of the vehicle is necessary to ensure its availability either as evidence or for a judgment of forfeiture. The burden of proof by a preponderance of the evidence as to each and every issue rests upon the Property Clerk.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-5\">As we observed in <em>People v Jones </em>(172 AD2d 265, 266 [1991], <em>lv denied 78 </em>NY2d 923 [1991]): \u201cA forcible stop and detention of a person is authorized by a police officer if he has reasonable suspicion that a person is committing or about to commit a crime (CPL 140.50 [1]; <em>People v De Bour, </em>40 NY2d 210, 223). Such reasonable suspicion must be based on specific and articulable facts and rational inference drawn therefrom <em>(People v Hicks, </em>68 NY2d 234, 238). An arrest is justified upon a finding of probable cause based upon information sufficient to support a reasonable belief that a person has committed a crime <em>(People v Bigelow, </em>66 NY2d 417, 423).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b233-6\">While the issues of whether there was reasonable suspicion for the initial stop of respondent and whether there was probable cause for his arrest require separate inquiries, the issues are interconnected in forfeiture cases since \u201c[i]f a seizure lacked probable cause, and the City could offer no untainted post-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>seizure evidence to justify further retention, the claimant\u2019s vehicle would ordinarily have to be released during the pendency of proceedings\u201d <em>(Krimstock, </em>306 F3d at 49).</p>\n<p id=\"b234-4\">Admittedly, there was no showing at the hearing that there was reasonable suspicion for the initial stop. As a result, petitioner was not able to offer \u201cuntainted post-seizure evidence to justify further retention\u201d <em>(id.).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b234-5\">The ALJ in this case did not exceed the scope of the hearing and his jurisdiction by requiring a showing of reasonable suspicion. Such a showing is the first step in any inquiry into the validity of a seizure <em>(see e.g. People v Jones, </em>172 AD2d 265 [1991], <em>supra). Krimstock </em>did not explicitly state that such a showing was required because the case involved seizure of vehicles after DWI arrests where the reason for the stop was obvious and articulated in the arrest reports. However, the <em>Krimstock </em>court did note that a warrantless arrest is not sufficient, in and of itself, \u201cto ensure the legality of the initial seizure . . . and in the absence of prompt review by a neutral fact-finder, we are left with grave Fourth Amendment concerns as to the adequacy of an inquiry into probable cause that must wait months or sometimes years before a civil forfeiture proceeding takes place\u201d (306 F3d at 50-51; <em>see also County of Nassau v Canavan, </em>1 NY3d 134, 142 [2003]).</p>\n<p id=\"b234-6\">This inquiry does not require a full evidentiary hearing. Indeed, the court in <em>Krimstock </em>specifically stated that: \u201c[w]e hasten to point out that we do not envision the retention hearing as a forum for exhaustive evidentiary battles that might threaten to duplicate the eventual forfeiture hearing. Inasmuch as the purpose of the hearing is the limited one of determining whether the vehicle should be returned to its owner during the pendency of proceedings, due process should be satisfied by an initial testing of the merits of the City\u2019s case\u201d (306 F3d at 69-70).</p>\n<p id=\"b234-7\">We therefore conclude that the IAS court\u2019s determination was correct and should be affirmed.
