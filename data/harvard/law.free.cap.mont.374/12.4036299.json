R. Civ. P. 60(b)(1) (Rule 60(b)). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-6\">ISSUE</p>\n<p id=\"b39-7\">\u00b62 A restatement of the dispositive issue on appeal is:</p>\n<p id=\"b39-8\">\u00b63 <em>Did the District Court err in granting summary judgment ?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b39-9\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b39-10\">\u00b64 This case arises from Chapman\u2019s complaint against LaDonna Maxwell, A.P.R.N. (Maxwell), asserting that Maxwell defamed her by documenting in Chapman\u2019s medical record her concern that Chapman may have been malingering or seeking narcotics. Maxwell filed her motion for summary judgment on April 1,2013. Chapman did not file a brief in response, and neither party requested oral argument. On or about May 6, 2013, Chapman expressly informed the District Court that she did not intend to file a brief opposing the motion because she wanted to mediate the case. On May 17, 2013, the District Court granted Maxwell\u2019s motion for summary judgment due to Chapman\u2019s failure to respond. The court noted that, though she was a self-represented litigant, Chapman was familiar with, and expected to follow, the rules of court. The court\u2019s review of dockets for the Eighth Judicial District Court, Montana Supreme Court, United States District Court for the District of Montana, and Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals revealed that Chapman had filed at least 43 cases. The court \u201cha[d] specifically advised Plaintiff in past cases that the failure to file a response brief within the time requirements will be deemed an admission that the motion is well taken\u201d and was concerned \u201cwith Plaintiff\u2019s motivations, conduct and actions in this litigation.\u201d The court notified Chapman of the vexatious litigant statute and the requirements of M. R. Civ. P. 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-11\">\u00b65 Chapman sought relief under Rule 60(b)(1) for excusable neglect because she \u201csimply forgot to file the brief.\u201d The court denied Chapman\u2019s motion, noting that Chapman lacked good faith and that Maxwell would be prejudiced if the court granted Chapman\u2019s motion. The court concluded that all litigants, including self-represented litigants, should adhere to procedural rules, that Chapman is familiar with the rules of court, and that \u201c[e]ven assuming Plaintiff simply missed the deadline (as opposed to her initial representation that she <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>intentionally chose not to file a brief to leverage a settlement), meeting deadlines requires no expert legal knowledge or skill.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b40-4\">\u00b66 Chapman filed a timely appeal. Chapman argues that the District Court erred in granting summary judgment to Maxwell and abused its discretion in denying her relief under Rule 60(b). Chapman further argues that Judges Gregory Pinski and Julie Macek violated the code of judicial conduct. We decline to address these unsupported accusations. Maxwell urges us to affirm the decision of the District Court and also asks us to declare Chapman a vexatious litigant pursuant to \u00a7 37-61-421, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-5\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b40-6\">\u00b67 We review a district court\u2019s ruling on motions for summary judgment de novo, using the same M. R. Civ. P. 56 (Rule 56) criteria used by the district court. <em>Pub. Lands Access Assn. v. Bd. of Co. Commrs., </em>2014 MT 10, \u00b6 15, 373 Mont. 277, 321 P.3d 38 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b40-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b40-8\">\u00b68 <em>Did the District Court err in granting summary judgment?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b40-9\">\u00b69 Montana Uniform District Court Rule 2(b) provides in part: \u201cFailure to file briefs may subject the motion to summary ruling .... Failure to file an answer brief by the opposing party within the time allowed shall be deemed an admission that the motion is well taken.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"ASO\">\u00b610 We have interpreted this rule as allowing the lower court discretion to either deny or grant unsupported or unanswered motions. <em>Moody v. Northland Royalty Co., </em>286 Mont. 89, 94, 951 P.2d 18, 22 (1997) (citations omitted). However, \u201cthe procedure to be followed on motions for summary judgment must conform to the provisions of Rule 56.\u201d <em>Cole v. Flathead Co., </em>236 Mont. 412, 417, 771 P.2d 97, 100 (1989). \u201c[T]he essential question for the District Court in deciding a motion for summary judgment ... is whether there exists a genuine issue of material fact. That inquiry does not admit of decision merely on a technical point, such as whether briefs have been filed on time.\u201d <em>Cole, </em>236 Mont. at 416, 771 P.2d at 100.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-10\">\u00b611 Though a district court may grant a motion for summary judgment without first holding a hearing, <em>see SVKV L.L.C. v. Harding, </em>2006 MT 297, \u00b6 37, 334 Mont. 395, 148 P.3d 584, it is still required to make a determination that there was no genuine issue of material fact and that the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. M. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(3); <em>see e.g. Cole, </em>236 Mont. at 417, 771 P.2d at 100 (\u201cThe <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>court has a duty under Rule 56 to deny a motion for summary judgment when there is any doubt whether a factual question exists.\u201d) (citations omitted). In this case, while Chapman\u2019s failure to file a response brief meant that Maxwell\u2019s motion was deemed well taken for purposes of Uniform District Court Rule 2(b), this does not relieve the District Court of the duty to engage in a Rule 56 analysis when presented with a motion for summary judgment. The court made no Rule 56 determination \u201cthat there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b41-5\">\u00b612 However, in light of our obligation to conduct a de novo review, this error does not require reversal. \u201c[Ojur <em>de novo </em>standard of review of summary judgment decisions allows us to review the record and make our own determinations regarding the existence of disputed issues of fact and entitlement to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d <em>Wurl v. Polson Sch. Dist. No. </em>23, 2006 MT 8, \u00b6 29, 330 Mont. 282, 127 P.3d 436. Here, our review of the pleadings and documents filed in the District Court convinces us there are no genuine issues of material fact. In her complaint, Chapman alleged that Maxwell defamed her by \u201cintentionally, negligently, and or recklessly without regard for the truth, verbally express[ing] to several persons[, including the judge, opposing counsel, and the account consultant in Chapman\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation case, and at least one physician,] that plaintiff Allison Chapman is and or was a drug seeker, and drug abuser,\u201d \u201cwas committing insurance fraud by pretending to have non-existent injuries,\u201d and/or \u201cwas a liar and only trying to scam money out of workers\u2019 compensation.\u201d Chapman argued that, because of Maxwell\u2019s statements, no doctor would consult with or treat her. Maxwell responded that: (1) her statements in the medical record were privileged and were disclosed with Chapman\u2019s consent; (2) her statements were true and/or merely opinions that did not rise to defamation; (3) Chapman provided no supporting evidence for her assertion that Maxwell made verbal statements to other providers; and (4) Chapman had no evidence that any medical provider refused to see her because of Maxwell\u2019s actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-6\">\u00b6 13 \u201cDefamation is effected by libel or slander.\u201d <em>McLeod v. State, </em>2009 MT 130, \u00b6 14, 350 Mont. 285, 206 P.3d 956 (citing \u00a7 27-1-801, MCA). \u201cLibel is a false and unprivileged publication by writing, printing, picture, effigy, or other fixed representation that exposes any person to hatred, contempt, ridicule, or obloquy or causes a person to be shunned or avoided or that has a tendency to injure a person in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>person\u2019s occupation.\u201d Section 27-1-802, MCA. \u201cSlander is a false and unprivileged publication other than libel that,\u201d for purposes of this case, \u201cby natural consequence causes actual damage.\u201d Section 27-1-803(5), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-5\">\u00b614  We conclude that Maxwell\u2019s statements in her medical records did not carry a defamatory meaning; therefore, it is unnecessary to determine whether they were false. The threshold test for a court is whether the statements, even if false, are capable of bearing a defamatory meaning. \u201cIf the alleged statements are not defamatory, it is unnecessary for a jury to decide if they are false.\u201d <em>McConkey v. Flathead Elec. Coop., </em>2005 MT 334, \u00b6 44, 330 Mont. 48, 125 P.3d 1121. The test for defamation is stringent. <em>McConkey, </em>\u00b6 45 (citation omitted). Libel and slander exist only with respect to \u201cunprivileged\u201d publications. <em>McLeod, </em>\u00b6 15. Privileges arise from the consent of the person defamed or are conferred by law. <em>Skinner v. Pistoria, </em>194 Mont. 257, 261, 633 P.2d 672, 675 (1981). \u201c[A] basic principal [sic] in the law of defamation is that an expression of opinion generally does not carry a defamatory meaning and is thus not actionable.\u201d <em>McConkey, </em>\u00b6 49.</p>\n<p id=\"A91\">\u00b615 Chapman\u2019s defamation claim fails as a matter of law. Chapman conceded that she \u201csigned maybe 20 releases of information\u201d making the communications to persons involved in Chapman\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation case privileged and not defamatory. <em>See Skinner, </em>194 Mont. at 261, 633 P.2d at 675. Moreover, Maxwell\u2019s comments were based on her personal observations and opinions and thus are not actionable. <em>See McConkey, </em>\u00b6 49. We further observe that in her deposition, Chapman was unable to provide evidence to support her claim that any medical provider refused to treat her because of Maxwell\u2019s comments. The record does indicate that medical providers refused to treat Chapman but does not suggest that this was due to Maxwell\u2019s comments. Indeed, Chapman mentioned many reasons why providers would not see her, including that she did not pay her medical bills.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-6\">\u00b616  While we have concluded that the District Court erred in failing to conduct a Rule 56 analysis, we also conclude that there are no genuine issues of material fact and that Maxwell is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Given our disposition of this issue, we decline to reach the second issue raised by Chapman of whether the District Court abused its discretion in denying her Rule 60(b) motion.</p>\n<p id=\"Ay\">\u00b617 Finally, we address Maxwell\u2019s request that we declare Chapman a vexatious litigant. \u201cCourts have the inherent power to levy sanctions to curb abusive litigation practices.\u201d <em>Hartsoe v. Tucker, </em>2013 MT 256, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>\u00b6 14, 371 Mont. 539, 309 P.3d 39 (citation omitted). \"Montana district courts possess inherent power to sanction willful or reckless conduct, especially when combined with frivolousness, harassment, or improper purpose.\u201d <em>Motta v. Granite Co. </em>Commrs., 2013 MT 172, \u00b6 17, 370 Mont. 469, 304 P.3d 720. Similarly, pursuant to M. R. App. P. 19(5), this Court \u201cha[s] the authority to award sanctions to a prevailing party in an appeal determined to be filed for the purposes of harassment, or taken without substantial or reasonable grounds.\u201d <em>Hartsoe, </em>\u00b6 14. Though we decline to levy such sanctions against Chapman in this case, we share the District Court\u2019s concern about her motivations, conduct, and actions and warn Chapman that if we see such behavior before us again, we will seriously consider a motion to declare her a vexatious litigant and impose sanctions.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b43-6\">\u00b618 For the foregoing reasons, we affirm.</p>\n<judges id=\"b43-7\">JUSTICES McKINNON, WHEAT, BAKER and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
