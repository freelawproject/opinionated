Stock was also convicted of evidence tampering in violation of \u00a7 45-7-207, MCA. Stock received concurrent sentences of fifty years at the Montana State Prison, with twenty-five years suspended, on each count of felony incest. He also was sentenced to a concurrent term of ten years for evidence tampering. He appealed his conviction, which this Court affirmed. <em>State v. Stock, </em>2011 MT 131, 361 Mont. 1, 256 P.3d 899. Stock also appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court, which denied certiorari. <em>Stock v. Montana, </em>132 S. Ct. 850 (Dec. 12, 2011). Stock then petitioned for postconviction relief in the First Judicial District Court, Lewis and Clark County, alleging ineffective assistance of counsel. The District Court dismissed Stock\u2019s petition, and he now appeals. A restatement of the dispositive issue on appeal is whether the District Court erred in concluding that Stock\u2019s attorney did not provide ineffective assistance. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-11\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b107-12\">\u00b62 In May2009, fourteen-year-old E.S. disclosed to a school counselor that his father, Stock, was sexually abusing him. Stock was subsequently charged with felony incest against E.S. In August 2009, the State amended the Information to include a second count of felony incest involving Stock\u2019s six-year-old daughter, KS., and one count of evidence tampering.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-13\">\u00b63 The State obtained a warrant to search Stock\u2019s computer for evidence that Stock was grooming his victims by showing them sexually inappropriate images. Agent Wayde Cooperider of the Department of Justice\u2019s Computer Crime Unit conducted the search <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>and discovered graphic images depicting young men engaged in homosexual activity, some of whom appeared to be underage. He also discovered search terms including \u201c7 year old having sex\u201d and \u201cTeenboyslove,\u201d along with sites that were visited including \u201cgaysnboys_com,\u201d \u201cdon_stock@gallery.teenboyslove[l]txt,\u201d and \u201cdon_stock@www.boysmagic[l]txt.\u201d Cooperider later testified that he retrieved these images from a password-protected computer with an assigned user name of \u201cDonald Stock.\u201d Cooperider summarized his findings in written reports.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-5\">\u00b64 The State filed a notice of intent to introduce the pornographic computer images based on M. R. Evid. 404(b) and \u00a7 26-1-103, MCA (the transaction rule). Stock, represented by defense attorney Chad Wright (Wright), filed a motion in limine objecting to the admission of the pornographic computer images, arguing that the prejudice it would cause outweighed its probative value, and that the State could not prove that Stock was responsible for accessing the images and websites. The District Court denied Stock\u2019s motion, concluding that the pornographic images were admissible pursuant to the transaction rule because it was directly related to elements of the incest charges with respect to both children, and that its relevance far outweighed any prejudice to Stock.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-6\">\u00b65 Stock\u2019s jury trial was held in March 2010, and lasted for seven days. Agent Cooperider testified to Exhibits 74-79, which were his written summaries of the electronic evidence found on Stock\u2019s computer. Thus, the State ultimately did not seek to admit the pornographic computer images themselves. When the State offered Exhibits 74-79, Stock only renewed his objection to Exhibit 74 because it did not include the dates and times the files were created, modified, and accessed. The State added the appropriate information to Exhibit 74, and the District Court admitted all of the exhibits. Thus, the admitted electronic evidence about which Stock complains consisted of testimony and written descriptions of electronic images and computer search terms, and not lurid, graphic images of pornography.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-7\">\u00b66 The State presented complicated expert testimony regarding the DNA evidence that was collected from E.S.\u2019s bed. The evidence was not conclusive, but the expert testimony indicated that Stock could not be excluded as a DNA contributor to DNA mixtures found in five areas of the bed, meaning that Stock\u2019s genetic information was present in the mixtures. During the State\u2019s closing argument, the prosecutor referenced this DNA evidence by saying, \u201cAsk yourself how is it that Don Stock\u2019s DNA is all over that bed?\u201d Stock did not object to this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-4\">\u00b67 On direct appeal, Stock argued that KS. should not have been allowed to testify via two-way electronic audio-video communication, that Stock should have been allowed to conduct a forensic interview of and call as a witness four-year-old Z.S, and that the electronic evidence was improperly admitted under the transaction rule. This Court affirmed the District Court on all issues. We did not reach the merits of the electronic evidence issue, finding that Stock failed to preserve for appeal any possible error arising out of the admission of the electronic evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-5\">\u00b68 In October 2012, Stock, represented by attorney Wright, filed a petition for postconviction relief, setting forth three grounds upon which he claimed his trial attorney (Wright) provided ineffective assistance of counsel. While Wright was assisted at trial by Gregory Jackson, Stock claims that only Wright provided ineffective assistance by failing to: 1) consult with a forensic computer examiner to evaluate the electronic evidence introduced at trial; 2) object to the introduction of the electronic evidence at trial; and 3) object to the prosecutor\u2019s allegedly improper statement dining closing argument that Stock\u2019s DNA was found \u201call over\u201d E.S.\u2019s bed. The District Court denied Stock\u2019s petition, stating \u201cWright did an excellent job in presenting pretrial motions ... which were addressed by both the district court and the Montana Supreme Court.\u201d It also found that even if Wright\u2019s representation was deficient, it would not have \u201ccreated a reasonable probability that the outcome of the trial, or the sentence imposed on Stock, would have been any different.\u201d Stock now appeals the District Court\u2019s denial of his petition for postconviction relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-6\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b109-7\">\u00b69 We review a district court\u2019s denial of a petition for postconviction relief to determine whether the court\u2019s findings of fact are clearly erroneous, and whether its conclusions of law are correct. <em>Camarillo v. State, </em>2005 MT 29, \u00b6 8, 326 Mont. 35, 107 P.3d 1265. Ineffective assistance of counsel claims present mixed questions of law and fact that are reviewed de novo. <em>Miller v. State, </em>2012 MT 131, \u00b6 9, 365 Mont. 264, 280 P.3d 272.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b109-9\">\u00b610 In his petition for postconviction relief, Stock asserted that Wright provided ineffective assistance of counsel at the trial level by failing to object to the introduction of the electronic evidence at trial, hire a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>forensic computer expert, and object to the prosecutor\u2019s reference to the DNA evidence during his closing argument. Stock also argues these issues on appeal, and additionally claims that the District Court did not correctly apply the test for evaluating his ineffective assistance of counsel claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-4\">\u00b611 <em>Whether the District Court erred in finding that Stock\u2019s attorney did not provide ineffective assistance.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b110-5\">\u00b612 The right to effective assistance of counsel is guaranteed by both the United States and the Montana Constitutions. U.S. Const, amend. VI; Mont. Const, art. II, \u00a7 24. The two-pronged <em>Strickland </em>test determines when this constitutional right has been violated. <em>Strickland v. Wash., </em>466 U.S. 668, 104 S. Ct. 2052 (1984). To satisfy this test, a defendant must show 1) that counsel's performance was deficient and 2) that counsel\u2019s deficient performance prejudiced the defense. <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 687, 104 S. Ct. at 2064. A defendant must satisfy both prongs of this test in order to prevail on an ineffective assistance of counsel claim. <em>Whitlow v. State, </em>2008 MT 140, \u00b6 11, 343 Mont. 90, 183 P.3d 861 (citing <em>Adams v. State, </em>2007 MT 35, \u00b6 22, 336 Mont. 63, 153 P.3d 601). \u201c[T]here is no reason for a court deciding an ineffective assistance claim to approach the inquiry in the same order or even to address both components of the inquiry if the defendant makes an insufficient showing on one.\u201d <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 697, 104 S. Ct. at 2069. As noted, the District Court rejected Stock\u2019s claims on this basis, concluding that even if Wright\u2019s conduct was constitutionally deficient, Stock failed to show that he was prejudiced.</p>\n<p id=\"AHK\">\u00b613 For the reasons discussed below, we agree with the District Court that Stock made an insufficient showing on the prejudice prong. As an initial matter, however, we address two important points relating to the issue of deficiency. First, Stock is represented in this postconviction case by the same counsel (Wright) who Stock alleges provided deficient representation at his trial. Essentially, Wright is challenging his own performance at trial, arguing that it was inadequate and that his errors were so serious as to deprive Stock of a fair trial. As our cases recognize, ineffective assistance of counsel claims usually require a defendant to develop a record as to \u201cwhy\u201d counsel did or did not perform as alleged, thus allowing the court to determine whether counsel\u2019s performance was ineffective or objectively reasonable. <em>See State v. Kougl, </em>2004 MT 243, \u00b6 14, 323 Mont. 6, 97 P.3d 1095; <em>Whitlow, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 19-20. As a result, Wright\u2019s role in this case is one of both advocate and witness. This scenario implicates ethical considerations.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>\u00b614 Rule 3.7(a) of the Montana Rules of Professional Conduct states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b111-4\">(a) A lawyer shall not act as advocate at a trial in which the lawyer is likely to be a necessary witness unless:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b111-5\">(1) the testimony relates to an uncontested issue;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b111-6\">(2) the testimony relates to the nature and value of legal services rendered in the case; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b111-7\">(3) disqualification of the lawyer would work substantial hardship on the client.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b111-8\">The identical rule is contained in Rule 3.7(a) of the American Bar Association (ABA) Model Rules of Professional Conduct.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Comment [1] to ABA Rule 3.7 notes that \u201c[c]ombining the roles of advocate and witness can prejudice the tribunal and the opposing party and can also involve a conflict of interest between the lawyer and client.\u201d Comment [2] further explains that \u201c[a] witness is required to testify on the basis of personal knowledge, while an advocate is expected to explain and comment on evidence given by others. It may not be clear whether a statement by an advocate-witness should be taken as proof or as an analysis of the proof.\u201d The reasoning underlying the exceptions listed in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of Rule 3.7(a) is articulated as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Axq\">Paragraph (a)(1) recognizes that if the testimony will be uncontested, the ambiguities in the dual role are purely theoretical. Paragraph (a)(2) recognizes that where the testimony concerns the extent and value of legal services rendered <em>in the action in which the testimony is offered, </em>permitting the lawyers to testify avoids the need for <em>a second trial with new counsel </em>to resolve that issue. Moreover, in such a situation the judge has firsthand knowledge of the matter in issue; hence, there is less dependence on the adversary process to test the credibility of the testimony. Apart from these two exceptions, paragraph (a)(3) recognizes that a balancing is required between the interests of the client and those of the tribunal and the opposing party.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b111-9\">ABA Model R. Prof. Conduct 3.7, Comments [3], [4] (emphasis added, paragraph break omitted). Comment [6] to ABA Rule 3.7 emphasizes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>that \u201c[i]n determining if it is permissible to act as advocate in a trial in which the lawyer will be a necessary witness, the lawyer must also consider that the dual role may give rise to a conflict of interest that will require compliance with\u201d ABA Rule 1.7 (Conflict of Interest: Current Clients) or ABA Rule 1.9 (Duties to Former Clients).</p>\n<p id=\"b112-5\">\u00b615 It does not appear that the first two exceptions listed in Montana Rule of Professional Conduct 3.7(a) apply to the present case. As to Rule 3.7(a)(1), despite assumptions that Stock (through Wright) makes in his brief on appeal, the question of Wright\u2019s deficiency is not \u201cuncontested.\u201d To the contrary, the State responds in its answer brief that it has <em>not </em>conceded the first prong of the <em>Strickland </em>test. As to Rule 3.7(a)(2), Wright\u2019s testimony does not concern legal services rendered \u201cin the action in which the testimony is offered.\u201d Rather, it concerns legal services rendered in a prior action. In this regard, Comment [3] to ABA Rule 3.7 indicates that the purpose of the exception in paragraph (a)(2) is to \u201cavoid[ ] the need for a second trial with new counsel\u201d to resolve questions about legal services in the first trial. Finally, as to the third exception in Rule 3.7(a), nothing in the record establishes whether disqualification of Wright would work \u201csubstantial hardship\u201d on Stock and whether Wright addressed potential conflicts of interest with his client.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-6\">\u00b616 The parties have not briefed the foregoing issues implicated by Rule 3.7(a), and the District Court did not enter any findings of fact bearing on this matter. Nevertheless, the notion of defense counsel in a criminal trial subsequently serving as the defendant\u2019s counsel in a postconviction proceeding which challenges the effectiveness of counsel\u2019s trial conduct raises important ethical considerations. While we cannot decide the matter on the record in the present case, we caution counsel and the district courts that this Court considers this a matter of importance which should be addressed, and a proper record made, at the outset of any postconviction proceeding where the petitioner\u2019s counsel contends that his or her trial performance was ineffective.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-7\">\u00b617 The second preliminary point we address concerning the issue of deficiency is the fact that Stock makes no effort in his brief on appeal to establish the first prong of the <em>Strickland </em>test \u2014 i.e., that his counsel\u2019s conduct \u201cfell below an objective standard of reasonableness.\u201d <em>Whitlow, </em>\u00b6 20. Apparently because the District Court rejected his claim under the second prong of the test, Stock\u2019s argument on appeal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>focuses entirely on that prong (i.e., prejudice).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Yet, even if we agreed with Stock\u2019s arguments on prejudice, we could not grant the relief he seeks \u2014 reversal of his convictions \u2014 absent a persuasive argument and showing that the prejudice resulted from objectively unreasonable acts or omissions of his counsel. <em>Strickland </em>says that there is no reason for <em>a court </em>deciding an ineffective assistance claim to address both components of the inquiry if the defendant makes an insufficient showing on one. 466 U.S. at 697, 104 S. Ct. at 2069; <em>accord Whitlow, </em>\u00b6 11. However, <em>Strickland </em>does not entitle <em>a defendant </em>to prevail based on only one prong of the analysis. As noted, our review of an ineffective assistance of counsel claim is de novo, <em>Miller, </em>\u00b6 9, and the fact that the District Court rested its decision on the prejudice prong does not relieve Stock of his burden to demonstrate the validity of his claims under <em>both </em>prongs of the test in his arguments to this Court on appeal. It thus was incumbent on Stock to explain \u2014 with reference to \u201cprevailing professional norms,\u201d <em>Whitlow, </em>\u00b6 20 \u2014 why his counsel\u2019s performance was deficient <em>and </em>that he suffered prejudice from that deficient performance.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b113-4\">\u00b618 Nevertheless, although Stock\u2019s claims arguably could be rejected based on his omission of any analysis relating to deficiency, we agree with the District Court that he has made an insufficient showing under the prejudice prong. Accordingly, we shall proceed to the merits of Stock\u2019s claims with an analysis of prejudice and without considering whether counsel\u2019s performance was objectively unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-5\">\u00b619 To establish prejudice, \u201cthe defendant must show that, but for counsel\u2019s errors, a reasonable probability exists that the result of the proceeding would have been different.\u201d <em>St. Germain v. State, </em>2012 MT 86, \u00b6 11, 364 Mont. 494, 276 P.3d 886 (citing <em>State v. Miner, </em>2012 MT <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>20, \u00b6 12, 364 Mont. 1, 271 P.3d 56.) A reasonable probability is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome of the proceeding. <em>Riggs v. </em>State, 2011 MT 239, \u00b6 12, 362 Mont. 140, 264 P.3d 693 (citing <em>Robinson v. State, </em>2010 MT 108, \u00b6 12, 356 Mont. 282, 232 P.3d 403). The prejudice inquiry focuses on whether counsel's deficient performance renders the result unreliable or the proceedings fundamentally unfair. <em>Riggs, </em>\u00b6 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-4\">\u00b620 Initially, Stock argues that the District Court\u2019s finding that he was not prejudiced by Wright\u2019s representation was not based on the totality of the evidence presented at trial. Stock implies that the District Court had only a passing knowledge of the underlying trial record, and therefore its finding that Stock suffered no prejudice was incorrect. In applying the prejudice prong of the <em>Strickland </em>test, the court must consider the totality of the evidence before the judge or juiy. <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 695, 104 S. Ct. at 2069. Stock\u2019s assertion that the District Court\u2019s ruling was not based on the totality of the evidence presented is simply unsupported. The District Court\u2019s Order cites to the record extensively, evidencing that it did indeed consider the totality of the evidence presented at trial. Therefore, the District Court did not misapply the <em>Strickland </em>test.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-5\">\u00b621  Stock argues that Wright\u2019s failure to properly object to the summaries of the electronic evidence constitutes ineffective assistance of counsel, and that it is generally improper to admit evidence that stands for the proposition that homosexuality establishes a propensity to engage in sexual activities with children. However, \u201c[a]n error by counsel, even if professionally unreasonable, does not warrant setting aside the judgment of a criminal proceeding if the error had no effect on the judgment.\u201d <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 691, 104 S. Ct. at 2067 (citing <em>U.S. v. Morrison, </em>449 U.S. 361, 364-65, 101 S. Ct. 665, 667 (1981)); <em>see also Heddings v. State, </em>2011 MT 228, \u00b6 33, 362 Mont. 90, 265 P.3d 600 (\u201cA claim of constitutionally ineffective assistance of counsel will not succeed when predicated upon counsel\u2019s failure to make motions or objections which... would likely not have changed the outcome of the proceeding.\u201d). Even if Wright\u2019s failure to properly object fell below an objective standard of reasonableness, such an error does not warrant setting aside Stock\u2019s judgment unless the error would have had an effect on the judgment. As the State correctly points out, even if Wright had properly renewed an objection at trial to the admission of Agent Cooperider\u2019s testimony and the summary exhibits, it appears probable that the District Court would have overruled the objection, based on the fact that the District Court denied Wright\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>motion in limine made prior to trial regarding the pornographic computer images. The only prejudice to Stock may have been that fading to renew his objection prevented a challenge on appeal to the admissibility of the evidence. <em>See Stock, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 45-48. Stock, however, has offered no analysis to support a claim that there would have been a different outcome on appeal had this Court considered admission of the evidence. Therefore, Stock has not met his burden of showing \u201c[a] reasonable probability... that the outcome of [his] direct appeal would have been different\u201d had Wright objected to the admission of the electronic evidence. <em>Rogers v. State, </em>2011 MT 105, \u00b6 40, 360 Mont. 334, 253 P.3d 889.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-4\">\u00b622 Stock also argues that Wright was ineffective for failing to hire a computer expert. In support of this argument in the District Court, Stock attached to his petition the report of forensic computer expert James Holmes, whose opinion was based only on an examination of Agent Cooperider\u2019s report, and not on an examination of the computer itself. However, on appeal Stock makes no reference to Holmes\u2019 report, and he fails to adequately develop this issue. Assuming Wright\u2019s actions in not hiring a computer expert were deficient, Stock fails to prove this decision prejudiced him. Holmes\u2019 report asserts that the computer from which the electronic evidence was extracted was not password protected as stated by Agent Cooperider, thereby supporting Stock\u2019s claim that he was not responsible for accessing the electronic evidence. The State responds with an affidavit from Agent Cooperider, who explains that Holmes\u2019 conclusion was based on a typographical error that Agent Cooperider made in his original report, and that Stock\u2019s computer was indeed password protected. The State also notes that Wright called a witness at trial who testified to seeing E.S. using Stock\u2019s computer on more than one occasion, thereby allowing the jury to infer through circumstantial evidence that E.S. accessed the electronic evidence, or alternatively, that Stock accessed it. This testimony accomplished the same purpose that Holmes\u2019 report would have, had it been introduced at trial, in that it would have caused the jury to question who was responsible for accessing the evidence. Therefore, because the question had already been raised, Stock cannot prove that but for Wright\u2019s failure to hire a computer expert, a reasonable probability exists that the result of the proceeding would have been different. <em>St. Germain, </em>\u00b6 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-5\">\u00b623 Stock argues that Wright was ineffective for failing to object to the prosecutor\u2019s \u201cmisleading\u201d statement made during his closing argument that the State had found Stock\u2019s DNA \u201call over\u201d E.S.\u2019s bed. To support <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>his petition, Stock included a report by forensic scientist Elizabeth Johnson, who reviewed the reports of the DNA evidence and concluded that the prosecutor had mischaracterized that evidence because the DNA examination \u201cdid not include every inch of the surface of the mattress.\u201d Johnson, however, agreed that Stock could not be ruled out as a contributor to five different DNA mixtures on E.S.\u2019s bed. The State contends that the prosecutor\u2019s statement was not misleading, and even if it was, Stock failed to prove the prejudice prong of the ineffective assistance of counsel claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-4\">\u00b624  As previously stated, a defendant is prejudiced when he or she shows that \u201cbut for counsel\u2019s errors, a reasonable probability exists that the result of the proceeding would have been different.\u201d <em>St. Germain, </em>\u00b6 11. Even if Wright\u2019s failure to object was deficient, Stock does not prove that he suffered any prejudice. Johnson\u2019s report does little to support Stock\u2019s argument. Even if the prosecutor intended the phrase \u201call over\u201d to be understood literally, both the State\u2019s expert and Johnson agree that Stock\u2019s genetic information was present in five different mixed samples taken from E.S.\u2019s bed. Stock has failed to show that any confusion about the DNA evidence was a result of the prosecutor\u2019s reference to DNA in his closing argument, compared to the extensive and complicated expert testimony regarding the DNA evidence. Additionally, the jury was informed that statements made during closing remarks could not be considered as evidence. Thus, Stock\u2019s claim that he was prejudiced by Wright\u2019s failure to object to the closing argument is essentially unsupported, and necessarily fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b116-6\">\u00b625 For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the District Court\u2019s denial of Stock\u2019s petition for postconviction relief.</p>\n<judges id=\"b116-7\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES WHEAT, COTTER and RICE concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b111-10\"> Although we have not adopted the ABA standards outright, we have previously cited them as persuasive authority. <em>See e.g. State v.

I write separately to address the problems created where, as here, counsel alleges his own ineffective assistance on appeal after representing a client at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-10\">\u00b627 It is both honorable and ethical for a lawyer to put his client\u2019s interests before his own and admit to error. However, evaluating claims of ineffective assistance of counsel requires an <em>objective </em>analysis of the lawyer\u2019s professional conduct or lack thereof. <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 687-88, 104 S. Ct. at 2064-65. An inherent conflict of interest <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>arises when counsel alleges his own ineffectiveness, and this conflict could easily cloud a lawyer\u2019s objective examination of his own professional conduct. <em>See People v. Bailey, </em>9 Cal. App. 4th 1252, 1254-55 (Cal. App. 1992); <em>In re Fountain, </em>74 Cal. App. 3d 715, 719 (Cal. App. 1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b117-5\">\u00b628 Montana Rule of Professional Conduct 1.7 provides that a conflict of interest exists when \u201cthere is a significant risk that the representation of one or more clients will be materially limited... by a personal interest of the lawyer.\u201d It is hard to imagine a more personal interest than the competency and success of one\u2019s own work. In an effort to obtain a new trial, counsel may be encouraged to raise questionable allegations of their own ineffectiveness. Alternatively, a lawyer who wants to avoid consequences for his error may subtly underemphasize or fail to identify his own deficient professional conduct. Finally, counsel may simply fail to recognize certain claims on appeal due to his own ineffectiveness on a certain issue. In any of these scenarios, the attorney\u2019s objective examination of his own error is cast into doubt. Additionally, an attorney who is ineffective at tried may later be accused of being ineffective on appeal, leaving IAC open to further attack without a fined resolution. <em>Bailey, </em>9 Cal. App. 4th at 1255.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-6\">\u00b629 This conflict of interest is especially concerning since the client makes \u201cdecisions concemingthe objectives of representation\u201d but relies on the conflicted lawyer to decide whether a claim has merit. Mont. R. Prof. Conduct 1.2(a) (2009). The client often lacks the technical legal expertise to decide whether an IAC claim has any merit, and so relies on the attorney to recognize his own deficiency and remedy it. That is likely the case here, where counsel\u2019s alleged deficiency was technical and unobvious, involving objections to summaries of electronic evidence, expert witnesses in computer technology, and objections to improper statements during closing. With no expertise of his own and likely without consulting outside counsel, a client in this situation is bound to rely on advice from a lawyer who has an interest in the client\u2019s decision. At bare minimum, counsel must obtain the client\u2019s informed written consent to representation burdened by such a conflict of interest. Mont. R. Prof. Conduct 1.7(b)(4). Comment [18] of ABA Rule 1.7 notes that \u201c[i]nformed consent requires that each affected client be aware of the relevant circumstances and of the material and reasonably foreseeable ways that the conflict could have adverse effects on the interests of that client.\u201d Yet even this protection is insufficient where a client lacks the technical knowledge to decide the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>merits of an IAC claim and must rely on his conflicted attorney to decide whether or not an error has occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-4\">\u00b630 We should require an attorney in this situation to withdraw representation as soon as he is aware of his own ineffectiveness. First, if counsel became aware of his error before the resolution of trial, this would prompt a district court to conduct a <em>Gallagher </em>inquiry to immediately determine whether IAC has occurred and whether new counsel or a new trial is needed. <em>See State v. Gallagher, </em>1998 MT 70, \u00b6\u00b6 24-26, 288 Mont. 180, 955 P.2d 1371. If ineffectiveness does not become apparent until after trial, this requirement would effectively mandate new counsel to objectively examine the professional conduct in question and advise the client on the validity of an IAC claim. That fresh look at the trial record creates an appropriate check on the trial attorney, as new counsel would have no incentive to minimize the errors of trial counsel, and would not be prone to file frivolous IAC claims in pursuit of success at trial. By requiring a fresh look at counsel\u2019s conduct, a client would receive objective advice as to whether his counsel was actually deficient, and could better decide whether an appeal on those grounds has merit.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
