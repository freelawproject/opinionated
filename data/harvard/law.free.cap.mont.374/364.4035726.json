When the Board initially denied his application on the ground that he did not meet the education-related qualifications, Mayer exercised his right to a contested case hearing. Following the hearing, the Hearing Officer entered proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law in favor of Mayer. The Board thereafter reviewed the Hearing Officer\u2019s decision and rejected several of his proposed findings and conclusions. The Board entered a final agency decision denying Mayer\u2019s application.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-8\">\u00b62 Mayer sought judicial review of the Board\u2019s final decision in the Thirteenth Judicial District Court, Yellowstone County. He argued that the Board had misapplied the standards governing the Board\u2019s review of a hearing officer\u2019s decision. The District Court affirmed the Board, and Mayer now appeals to this Court. The issue on appeal is whether the District Court correctly affirmed the Board\u2019s final decision. The question, more specifically, is whether the Board had sufficient grounds for rejecting certain findings and conclusions of the Hearing Officer. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-9\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b391-10\">\u00b63 The Legislature has determined \u201cthat the practice of psychology in Montana affects the public health, safety, and welfare and should therefore be subject to regulation and control in the public interest in order to protect the public from the unauthorized and unqualified practice of psychology and from unprofessional conduct by persons licensed to practice psychology.\u201d Section 37-17-101, MCA. To that end, the Legislature has established the Board of Psychologists, which consists of six members appointed by the Governor with the consent of the Senate. Two members must be licensed psychologists in private practice, one member must be a licensed psychologist in public health, one member must be a licensed psychologist engaged in the teaching of psychology, and two members must be from the general public. Section 2-15-1741, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-11\">\u00b64 Of significance to this case, the Board is required to license as a psychologist any person who satisfies certain specified criteria. Section 37-17-302, MCA. In particular, the person must be at least 18 years of age and of good moral character, pay the prescribed fee, pass the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>prescribed examination, and have completed at least two years of supervised experience in the practice of psychology. Section 37-17-302(1), (2), (4), MCA. Additionally, the person must submit evidence that he or she:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-4\">(a) has received a doctoral degree in clinical psychology from an accredited college or university having an appropriate graduate program approved by the American psychological association;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-5\">(b) has received a doctoral degree in psychology from an accredited college or university not approved by the American psychological association and has successfully completed a formal graduate retraining program in clinical psychology approved by the American psychological association; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-6\">(c) has received a doctoral degree in psychology from an accredited college or university and has completed a course of studies that meets minimum standards specified in rules by the board.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b392-7\">Section 37-17-302(3), MCA. Essentially, under subsections (a) and (b), the person must have completed a graduate program in clinical psychology approved by the American Psychological Association (APA), whereas under subsection (c), the person must have completed a course of studies that meets standards specified by the Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-8\">\u00b65 Mayer worked as a counselor at the Yellowstone Boys and Girls Ranch when he decided to pursue a Ph.D. in psychology. He enrolled in the clinical psychology program at Walden University in 1997 and obtained a doctorate of philosophy in clinical psychology in May 2005. Walden is an online university that administers its classes primarily over the Internet. Since 1990, Walden has been accredited by the Higher Learning Commission, which accredits degree-granting colleges and universities in the north central region of the United States. Walden\u2019s clinical psychology program, however, is not accredited by the APA. Thus, Mayer\u2019s licensure application fell under subsection (c) of \u00a7 37-17-302(3), MCA \u2014 meaning that his course of studies had to meet the standards specified in the Board\u2019s rules. Those standards are detailed below.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-9\">\u00b66 After obtaining his degree in 2005, Mayer applied with the Board to become licensed as a psychologist. It appears that no decision was made on that application. Mayer renewed his application in late 2008 and provided supporting materials in 2009. As with his initial application, Mayer again relied on the education he had received at Walden. The Board denied the application at a meeting held on June 17,2010, citing three reasons for the denial: noncompliance with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>academic residency requirement, noncompliance with the curricular requirements, and inadequate assessment of student performance in the curriculum.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-4\">\u00b67 Mayer challenged the Board\u2019s June 17, 2010 decision and requested a hearing. Under the statutory framework, a person who is denied a license is entitled to a contested case hearing before an impartial hearings examiner. <em>See </em>\u00a7\u00a7 2-4-631(1), 37-1-121(1), 37-l-131(l)(b), 37-l-307(l)(a), MCA. The hearing must be conducted in accordance with the Montana Administrative Procedure Act, the Montana Rules of Civil Procedure, and the Montana Rules of Evidence, \u00a7 37-1-310, MCA, and all parties must be afforded an opportunity to respond and present evidence and argument on all issues involved, \u00a7 2-4-612(1), MCA. Although the hearing is conducted by a hearings examiner, the final agency decision is made by the Board. <em>See </em>\u00a7\u00a7 2-4-621(3), 37-l-131(l)(b), MCA. As will be seen, this puts the Board in the position of first presenting evidence at the hearing and advocating in support of its initial decision denying the licensure application, and then reviewing the hearings examiner\u2019s proposed findings and conclusions following the hearing. The Board is not permitted, however, to simply discard the hearings examiner\u2019s decision and reaffirm the Board\u2019s original denial. Rather, as discussed below, the Board is constrained by the standards of review set forth in \u00a7 2-4-621(3), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-5\">\u00b68 A two-day contested case hearing was held in March 2011. The Hearing Officer admitted seven exhibits, which included documents from Mayer\u2019s application file, syllabus pages from Walden University, and guidelines for accrediting professional psychology programs. Two witnesses testified. The Board, through counsel, presented testimony from Dr. Christine Fiore, who is a professor of psychology at the University of Montana. Mayer, who also was represented by counsel, testified on his own behalf. The testimony from both Dr. Fiore and Mayer focused on whether Walden\u2019s program met the residency and curricular requirements adopted by the Board for universities that are not APA-accredited. The Board\u2019s rules, in summary, contain the following requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-6\">\u00b69 First, as to residency, a non-APA-accredited psychology program must include \u201ca minimum of three academic years of full-time graduate study with a minimum of <em>one year\u2019s residency </em>at the educational institution granting the doctoral degree.\u201d Admin. R. M. 24.189.604(l)(i) (emphasis added). Relevant to the Hearing Officer\u2019s analysis, the Board amended the definition of \u201cone year\u2019s academic residency\u201d during the time frame when the Board was considering <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>Mayer\u2019s application. Under the old definition, \u201cone year\u2019s academic residency\u201d meant \u201c18 semester hours or 27 quarter hours earned on a full-time or part-time basis at the educational institution granting the doctoral degree.\u201d Admin. R. M. 24.189.301(2) (2009). The residency had to be accumulated in not less than 9 months and not more than 18 months, and had to include \u201cface-to-face (personal)\u201d group courses where there is \u201cboth faculty-to-student and student-to-student interaction.\u201d Admin. R. M. 24.189.301(2)(a)(i). The institution had to document its assessment and evaluation of the student\u2019s performance. Admin. R. M. 24.189.301(2)(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b394-4\">\u00b610 The Board amended Rule 24.189.301(2) in 2010 based on the perception that \u201csome, applicants do not appear to understand what is meant by \u2018one year\u2019s academic residency.\u2019 \u201d 12 Mont. Admin. Register 1508 (June 24,2010). The Board sought in the amended rule \u201cto more thoroughly and completely delineate the specific components of the residency requirement.\u201d 3 Mont. Admin. Register 303 (Feb. 11,2010). For example, the rule now defines \u201cone year\u2019s academic residency\u201d as <em>\u201ccontinuous, full time, </em>active engagement by the student in the elements of the training program while the student is <em>physically present </em>during one academic year at the educational institution.\u201d Admin. R. M. 24.189.301(2) (2011) (emphases added). The year of academic residency must consist of \u201ctwo semesters or three quarters with continuous experience on campus, in no less than three month increments,\u201d and it must be accrued in no more than 18 months. Admin. R. M. 24.189.30l(2)(c). Full-time status means \u201cat least 30 hours on campus per week.\u201d Admin. R. M. 24.189.301(2)(d). There must be \u201cface-to-face (personal)\u201d interaction among faculty and students, Admin R. M. 24.189.301(2)(e)(i), and the new definition now makes clear that videoconferencing and other electronic means are not sufficient, Admin. R. M. 24.189.301(2)(b), (g).</p>\n<p id=\"b394-5\">\u00b611 As to curriculum, the Board\u2019s rules<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> require that the program \u201cbe an organized sequence of study ... to provide an integrated education experience appropriate to the professional practice of psychology.\u201d Admin. R. M. 24.189.604(lXe). Each student must receive instruction in \u201cscientific and professional ethics and standards, research design and methodology, statistics and psychometrics,\u201d and must demonstrate competence in four substantive areas: biological bases of behavior, cognitive-affective bases of behavior, social bases of behavior, and individual differences. Admin. R. M. 24.189.604(lXi). The program <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>must include at least 60 quarter homs or 40 semester hours of \u201cformal graduate study\u201d in psychology as well as \u201cexamination and grading procedures designed to evaluate the degree of mastery of the subject matter by the student.\u201d Admin. R. M. 24.189.604(l)(i)(v)(A), (B).</p>\n<p id=\"b395-5\">\u00b612 Dr. Fiore admitted that Mayer\u2019s studies at Walden satisfied many, if not most, of the Board\u2019s requirements. Nevertheless, it was her opinion that Walden\u2019s program did not meet the Board\u2019s standards in certain critical respects. She based this opinion on her review of Mayer\u2019s application file and the syllabi from the Walden courses Mayer had taken, and on her assessments of Walden\u2019s courses against the APA standards and the psychology program at the University of Montana. As noted, Dr. Fiore is a professor of psychology, as well as the Director of Clinical Training, at the University of Montana. The psychology program at the University of Montana is APA-accredited, and Dr. Fiore has twice assisted the University with the accreditation process. She therefore considers herself \u201cvery familiar\u201d with the APA standards. Under cross-examination, Dr. Fiore conceded that Mayer\u2019s application was not subject to the APA standards or to the policies of the University of Montana; rather, it was subject to the standards adopted by the Board under \u00a7 37-17-302(3)(c), MCA. Dr. Fiore opined, however, that the Board\u2019s standards and the APA standards are \u201cvery similar... in terms of hours, residency, courses, etc.\u201d In this regard, Dr. Fiore discussed a letter the Board had sent to the APA in 2007 in which the Board indicated that it relies on the criteria developed by the APA\u2019s Committee on Accreditation in determining whether a given training program meets the Board\u2019s own criteria. Dr. Fiore understood the Board\u2019s rules for non-APA-accredited programs, therefore, as being modeled on the APA standards while permitting some \u201cflexibility.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AzC\">\u00b613 Based on this understanding, Dr. Fiore opined that Walden\u2019s program failed the Board\u2019s residency requirement because the Walden program did not require \u201ccontinuous enrollment for a[n academic] year ... in physical residence.\u201d Dr. Fiore conceded that the Board\u2019s old definition of residency does not state expressly that the enrollment must be \u201ccontinuous\u201d and \u201cin physical residence.\u201d She maintained, however, that an academic residency in psychology is not effective unless there is physical presence and continuous enrollment for the academic year. She explained that the residency enables the student to concentrate on coursework, professional training, and scholarship; to work closely with professors, supervisors, and other students; to receive support in thesis, dissertation, or doctored work through frequent consultations with advisors; and to acquire habits, skills, and insights necessary for attaining a doctoral degree in psychology. Dr. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>Fiore stated that these purposes are accomplished through continuous close association and mentoring with faculty members and other students. In her opinion, showing up for three-week sessions in the summer and long weekends at other times of year (as Mayer had done) is insufficient for fillfilling an academic residency in psychology.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-4\">\u00b614 As to curriculum, Dr. Fiore went through each of Mayer\u2019s Walden courses and explained why she believed the courses were insufficient. She cited primarily two reasons why the courses did not meet the Board\u2019s standards. First, as noted, the Board\u2019s rules require \u201can organized sequence of study ... to provide an integrated education experience appropriate to the professional practice of psychology.\u201d Admin. R. M. 24.189.604(l)(e). In Dr. Fiore\u2019s opinion, based on her familiarity with APA-accredited graduate programs, Walden\u2019s courses were not organized in a proper sequence of study. She stated that she could not perceive \u201cthe rhyme or reason of how courses are taken\u201d at Walden. In basing her opinion in part on the APA standards, Dr. Fiore reiterated that the Board\u2019s standards are modeled on, and substantially the same as, the APA standards. Second, the Board\u2019s rules also require the program to include a certain number of horns of \u201cformal graduate study\u201d in psychology, plus \u201cexamination and grading procedures designed to evaluate the degree of mastery of the subject matter by the student.\u201d Admin. R. M. 24.189.604(l)(i)(v)(A), (B). In Dr. Fiore\u2019s opinion, the classes and level of instruction at Walden were \u201cmore consistent with undergraduate level education than graduate level education.\u201d Dr. Fiore testified repeatedly that Walden\u2019s courses lacked the necessary \u201cbreadth\u201d and \u201cdepth\u201d expected of graduate level courses. She also indicated that the methods used at Walden for assessing students\u2019 mastery of the subject matter were inadequate. In this regard, Dr. Fiore posited that the one-to-thirty ratio of faculty to students at Walden is \u201cmore like undergraduate education\u201d and inhibits appropriate assessment of student competence at a graduate level.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-5\">\u00b615 Mayer testified that he received an undergraduate degree in psychology from the University of Montana in 1991 and a master of science in rehabilitation counseling from Montana State University-Billings in 1995. Mayer has worked in the human services and mental health field since 1992 and at the Yellowstone Boys and Girls Ranch since 1993. He was licensed in Montana as a clinical professional counselor in 1996.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-6\">\u00b616 Mayer explained that he had selected Walden partly because his family lived in Billings and he had been unwilling to relocate to an APA-accredited school. He stated that he had reviewed the Board\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>rules and concluded that Walden\u2019s program met the Board\u2019s requirements. Mayer noted that he had contacted the Board early in his studies at Walden and inquired whether Walden was an approved university, but the Board did not give him an answer. Mayer chose to continue his studies at Walden nonetheless.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-4\">\u00b617 Mayer testified that he had completed 27 quarter hours in residence \u201cat Walden\u201d within an 18-month period and that the majority of the residency included face-to-face time with faculty and students. He conceded that the residency consisted of a three-week simvmer session, several long weekends throughout the year, and then another three-week summer session. As to curriculum, Mayer testified about the topics covered in each of his Walden courses, as stated on the syllabi. He also testified from memory regarding some of his coursework. He explained having to provide scholarly input at least twice a week to the ongoing list-serve discussions led by the professors, as well as having to provide critical evaluations of other students\u2019 work posted on these online forums. Mayer maintained that his studies were \u201cmore demanding and interactive\u201d than Dr. More had suggested during her testimony, and he posited that all of his Walden courses were graduate level courses. His opinion in this regard, however, was based on his comparison of his Walden courses to his undergraduate classes at the University of Montana and his master\u2019s program at Montana State University-Billings. Mayer conceded that he had no experience with other graduate psychology programs. He also conceded that aspects of the Walden program were not \u201crobust\u201d and that the training depended largely on each individual student\u2019s own diligence and \u201cself-motivat[ion].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b397-5\">\u00b618 Finally, Mayer noted that he had worked with two Montana-licensed psychologists at the Yellowstone Boys and Girls Ranch. He testified that both psychologists had indicated that they were satisfied with his work inrelation to psychological assessment, competemy, and consultation services. Mayer stated that, in his opinion, the training he received at Walden met the Board\u2019s rules for non-APA-accredited programs and adequately prepared him for the practice of psychology.</p>\n<p id=\"Age\">\u00b619 The Hearing Officer issued his proposed findings of fact, proposed conclusions of law, and recommended order on November 14,2011. As an initial matter, the Hearing Officer addressed the Board\u2019s amendments to the definition of \u201cone year\u2019s academic residency.\u201d As noted, the new definition makes it explicit that the residency must be \u201cfull time,\u201d consisting of \u201ccontinuous experience on campus, in no less than three month increments,\u201d and that the student must be \u201cphysically present\u201d during one academic year at the educational <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>institution. Admin. R. M. 24.189.301(2)(c) (2011). The Hearing Officer construed these as new requirements not imposed by the prior definition of \u201cone year\u2019s academic residency.\u201d Because the new definition became effective on June 25, 2010 \u2014 eight days after the Board\u2019s initial denial of Mayer\u2019s application \u2014 the Hearing Officer concluded that the prior definition controls. Though the Board has never disputed that the prior definition is controlling, the Hearing Officer nevertheless concluded that the reasons advanced by the Board and Dr. Fiore for finding Mayer\u2019s residency at Walden inadequate were premised on the requirements contained in the amended definition. As such, the Hearing Officer determined that the Board and Dr. Fiore were improperly attempting to subject Mayer to new, inapplicable residency criteria.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-5\">\u00b620 The Hearing Officer also rejected Dr. Fiore\u2019s opinion concerning residency for a second reason. Specifically, the Hearing Officer perceived \u201cconsiderable inconsistencies in her testimony about what standard she was testifying about.\u201d The Hearing Officer stated that Dr. Fiore referred \u201call too frequently\u201d to the APA\u2019s criteria and the practices of the University of Montana, and that her testimony displayed \u201cconsiderable lack of familiarity\u201d with the Board\u2019s standards. Based on his interpretation of the prior definition of \u201cone year\u2019s academic residency,\u201d the Hearing Officer found that Mayer had satisfied the residency requirement because he \u201cattended classes in-person on campus and earned more than 27 quarter hours on a full-time basis,\u201d his classes \u201cincluded student-to-faculty and student-to-student contact and involved personal group courses,\u201d and his performance was \u201cdocumented by the institution.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b398-6\">\u00b621 As to curriculum, the Hearing Officer found Mayer\u2019s testimony alone \u201csufficient to show that he completed the required course work.\u201d Conversely, the Hearing Officer again felt that Dr. Fiore\u2019s testimony was \u201cinconsistent about the standards for the course work\u201d because she frequently referred to the curricular requirements of the APA and the University of Montana. The Hearing Officer found that Mayer\u2019s studies at Walden included instruction in the various content areas described in Rule 24.189.604, that he successfully completed the required courses, and that he had the requisite meetings with faculty relating to the program and course content. The Hearing Officer dismissed Dr. Fiore\u2019s concerns regarding the breadth and depth of Walden\u2019s courses, stating merely that \u201cit is clear based on Mayer\u2019s testimony and the effect of the rules that he met those requirements.\u201d Finally, based on \u201coutstanding recommendations\u201d included in Mayer\u2019s application file, which indicated that \u201cMayer meets the expectations of his peers, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>and uses and understands the work of a licensed psychologist,\u201d the Hearing Officer opined that \u201cany doubts about the sufficiency of his course work should be resolved in his favor because his work experience and the knowledge of those most familiar with it indicate that the knowledge he gained at Walden University was sufficient.\u201d The Hearing Officer accordingly recommended that, pending the outcome of his examination, the Board grant Mayer\u2019s application for licensure as a psychologist.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-4\">\u00b622 The Board issued its findings of fact, conclusions of law, and final order on February 10, 2012. The Board adopted a majority of the Hearing Officer\u2019s findings and conclusions, but rejected or modified several critical findings and conclusions and reinstated its denial of Mayer\u2019s application. As to residency, the Board concluded that the Hearing Officer had misinterpreted the definition of \u201cone year\u2019s academic residency\u201d under Admin. R. M. 24.189.301(2) (2009). The Board indicated that the residency must be fulfilled at the educational institution and that it must be continuous.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The Board modified the Hearing Officer\u2019s finding to state: \u201cMayer attended classes in-person but not on campus.\u201d Regarding curriculum, the Board concluded that the Hearing Officer had misapplied the criteria governing the sequence, content, and assessment of Mayer\u2019s coursework at Walden. The Board stated that the Walden psychology program \u201clacked an organized sequence of study\u201d and that the Walden coursework \u201clacked substantive content, adequate assessment of student competence, and adequate evaluation of student mastery through examinations and grading procedures.\u201d In this regard, the Board criticized the Hearing Officer for accepting what the Board characterized as Mayer\u2019s \u201cbiased, lay testimony\u201d over the \u201cexpert\u201d testimony of the Board\u2019s witness, Dr. Fiore. Finally, the Board expressed frustration with the Hearing Officer\u2019s consideration of the \u201coutstanding recommendations\u201d in Mayer\u2019s file. The Board indicated that whether Mayer meets the expectations of his peers is not relevant to the issue of whether Walden\u2019s program satisfies the Board\u2019s residency and curricular rules.</p>\n<p id=\"Ad\">\u00b623 Mayer sought judicial review of the Board\u2019s decision. In affirming the Board, the District Court concluded that the Board had not erred in accepting Dr. Fiore\u2019s testimony over Mayer\u2019s testimony concerning <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>the adequacy of Walden\u2019s coursework. The District Court acknowledged that Mayer could testify as to the content of his classes; however, the court reasoned that because the only doctoral-level courses he had ever taken were at Walden, Mayer had nothing to compare those courses to and no basis for believing they were adequate under the Board\u2019s rules. As to residency, the District Court noted that the record is unclear as to where and how Mayer\u2019s residency was completed. Mayer testified that he had completed his residency \u201cat Walden.\u201d Conversely, the Board claimed that the residency had occurred at hotel conference rooms. Although the Board did not cite to the record in support of this claim, Mayer did not challenge the assertion either. Thus, the District Court inferred that Mayer\u2019s residency did not take place \u201cat the campus\u201d of Walden University. The court concluded that the Board was correct in determining that Mayer had not satisfied the residency requirement. Mayer now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-4\">STANDARDS OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b400-5\">\u00b624 The Montana Board of Psychologists is considered an \u201cagency\u201d for purposes of the Montana Administrative Procedure Act.

We employ the same standards when reviewing a district court\u2019s order affirming or reversing an agency decision. <em>Ostergren, </em>\u00b6 11; <em>Briese, </em>\u00b6 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-6\">\u00b625 The Board\u2019s final agency decision was based in part on the Board\u2019s interpretations of its own rules. Those rules were enacted pursuant to the authority of \u00a7\u00a7 37-1-131(1)(a), 37-17-202(1), and 37-17-302(3Xc), MCA.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The interpretation of an administrative rule is a question of law. <em>St. Personnel Div. v. Child Support Investigators, </em>2002 MT 46, \u00b6 62, 308 Mont. 365, 43 P.3d 305. However, in determining whether an agency correctly interpreted its own rules, procedures, or policies, the agency\u2019s interpretation should be afforded great weight, and the reviewing court should defer to that interpretation unless it is plainly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>inconsistent with the spirit of the rule. <em>Knowles v. State ex rel. Lindeen, </em>2009 MT 415, \u00b6 22, 353 Mont. 507, 222 P.3d 595. The agency\u2019s interpretation of the rule will be sustained so long as it lies within the range of reasonable interpretation permitted by the wording. <em>Knowles, </em>\u00b6 22.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b401-6\">\u00b626 <em>Did the Board have sufficient grounds for rejecting certain findings and conclusions of the Hearing Officer?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b401-7\">\u00b627 Mayer contends that the Board misapplied the standards governing its review of the Hearing Officer\u2019s decision. In reviewing a healing officer\u2019s proposed decision, the Board may reject or modify the conclusions of law and interpretations of administrative rules, but the Board may not reject or modify the findings of fact unless the Board \u201cfirst determines from a review of the complete record and states with particularity in the order that the findings of fact were not based upon competent substantial evidence or that the proceedings on which the findings were based did not comply with essential requirements of law.\u201d Section 2-4-621(3), MCA. In reviewing findings of fact, the question is not whether there is evidence to support different findings, but whether competent substantial evidence supports the findings actually made. <em>Knowles, </em>\u00b6 21; \u00a7 2-4-621(3), MCA. Competent evidence is evidence that is relevant and admissible. <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>635, 636,639 (Bryan A. Garner ed., 9th ed., Thomson Reuters 2009). Substantial evidence is \u201c[ejvidence that a reasonable mind could accept as adequate to support a conclusion; evidence beyond a scintilla.\u201d <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>640. The agency\u2019s experience, technical competence, and specialized knowledge may be utilized in the evaluation of evidence. Section 2-4-612(7), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-8\">\u00b628 Mayer argues that it was not the Board\u2019s role to weigh inconsistent testimony or to substitute its view of the facts for those found by the Hearing Officer. He maintains that there was competent substantial evidence to support the Hearing Officer\u2019s findings and that the Board, therefore, should be reversed. The Board responds that it complied with \u00a7 2-4-621(3), MCA. The Board maintains that the Hearing Officer misinterpreted the Board\u2019s rules and that his findings were not based upon competent substantial evidence. The Board asserts that the only evidence offered to show that Walden\u2019s program satisfied the Board\u2019s curricular requirements was Mayer\u2019s own \u201cself-interested lay\u201d testimony, which in the Board\u2019s view was insufficient to rebut the \u201cexpert\u201d testimony of the Board\u2019s witness, Dr. Fiore. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>Board also argues that the residency requirement was not satisfied because \u201cthe location of where the residency hours were earned was simply not established by any evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b402-4\">\u00b629 Initially, we agree with Mayer that it is not appropriate for a board to substitute its judgment for that of the hearing officer as to the credibility of witnesses and the weight to be given their testimony. <em>See St. Personnel Div., </em>\u00b6 26 (\u201cThe purpose of \u00a7 2-4-621(3), MCA, is to prevent a reviewing body from substituting its judgment for that of the factfinder.\u201d). \u201cA hearing examiner, when one is used, is in the unique position of hearing and observing all testimony entered in the case.\u201d <em>Brackman v. Bd. of Nursing, </em>258 Mont. 200, 205, 851 P.2d 1055, 1058 (1993). In <em>Brackman, </em>as in the present case, none of the board members had heard the evidence \u201clive\u201d; rather, they were limited to reviewing \u201ca cold record.\u201d 258 Mont. at 205, 851 P.2d at 1058. Hence, we stated that \u201c[t]he findings of the hearing examiner, especially as to witness credibility, are therefore entitled to great deference.\u201d <em>Brockman, </em>258 Mont. at 205-06, 851 P.2d at 1058 (citing \u00a7 2-4-621, MCA).</p>\n<p id=\"b402-5\">\u00b630 Similarly, we do not accept the Board\u2019s argument that an applicant must present expert testimony in order to overcome the testimony of the Board\u2019s expert witness. A blanket rule of this nature would usurp the hearing examiner\u2019s role to judge the credibility of witnesses and the weight to be given their testimony. It also would put applicants in the position of always having to retain an expert in order to challenge the Board\u2019s denials of their applications. Of course, without expert testimony, an applicant might fail to demonstrate that his or her application should have been granted. However, that will depend on the particular facts of the case and the applicant\u2019s specific circumstances. There is no rule \u2014 statutory or administrative \u2014 mandating that an applicant present expert testimony at the contested case hearing in order to challenge the denial of his or her licensure application.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-6\">\u00b631 Nevertheless, we conclude the Board\u2019s decision was properly affirmed. At the outset, the residency issue is somewhat problematic. To meet the \u201cone year\u2019s academic residency\u201d requirement under the prior rule \u2014 which all parties agree is controlling \u2014 Mayer had to earn 27 quarter hours \u201cat the educational institution granting the doctoral degree.\u201d Admin. R. M. 24.189.301(2) (2009). The Board has interpreted \u201cat the educational institution\u201d to mean physical presence, and this is a reasonable interpretation of the rule. <em>Knowles, </em>\u00b6 22. However, as noted, the record is not clear as to where and how Mayer\u2019s residency was completed. Mayer testified that he completed his residency \u201cat <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>Walden,\u201d while the Board claimed (without citing to the record) that the residency occurred at unspecified hotel conference rooms. Furthermore, the Board has interpreted the residency rule as requiring \u201ccontinuous\u201d enrollment, as explained in Dr. Fiore\u2019s testimony. Yet, while the amended rule makes this requirement explicit, nothing in the prior rule gave applicants notice that the residency had to be continuous. In fact, the prior rule could be read as indicating just the opposite, by permitting the residency to be earned \u201con a full-time or part-time basis\u201d over a period of \u201cnot less than nine months and not more than 18 months.\u201d Admin. R. M. 24.189.301(2)(a) (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b403-4\">\u00b632 We need not resolve the parties\u2019 arguments regarding the residency requirement, however, because we conclude the Board\u2019s denial of Mayer\u2019s application is supported by the curricular requirement. First, the Hearing Officer erred in rejecting Dr. Fiore\u2019s assessment of Mayer\u2019s studies at Walden on the ground that she relied \u201ctoo frequently\u201d on the APA standards and the practices at the University of Montana (whose psychology program is APA-accredited). The Hearing Officer perceived the Board\u2019s curricular standards as being materially different from the APA standards. That was an incorrect interpretation of the Board\u2019s rules. Based on her familiarity with the Board\u2019s standards and the history of their adoption, Dr. Fiore testified that the Board modeled its curricular standards on the criteria developed by the APA\u2019s Committee on Accreditation. Thus, the reason Dr. Fiore did not attempt to distinguish between the Board\u2019s rules and the APA rules is that the two are, as she put it, \u201cvery similar.\u201d The Board, through this witness\u2019s testimony, has construed its curricular standards as mirroring the APA criteria. In light of Dr. Fiore\u2019s unrefuted testimony, this interpretation is reasonable and the Hearing Officer should have deferred to it. <em>Knowles, </em>\u00b6 22.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-5\">\u00b633  Second, the Board\u2019s rules require \u201can organized sequence of study... to provide an integrated education experience appropriate to the professional practice of psychology,\u201d and the program must involve \u201cformal graduate study\u201d in psychology. Admin. R. M. 24.189.604(l)(e), (i)(v)(A). Based on her familiarity with APA-accredited graduate programs, Dr. Fiore testified that Walden\u2019s courses were not organized in a proper sequence of study and did not have the necessary breadth and depth expected of graduate level courses. Although Mayer opined that his Walden courses were graduate level courses, he admittedly had no knowledge of other graduate psychology programs. Other than comparing his Walden classes to his undergraduate classes at the University of Montana and his master\u2019s program at Montana State <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>University-Billings, he had no frame of reference or basis for giving an opinion as to whether Walden\u2019s courses were organized in a proper sequence or whether they constituted \u201cformal graduate study\u201d under the Board\u2019s rule. The Hearing Officer\u2019s finding that Walden\u2019s courses satisfied the Board\u2019s curricular rules was, therefore, not based upon competent substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b404-6\">\u00b634  The Board was permitted to reject or modify the Hearing Officer\u2019s interpretations of the Board\u2019s rules and to reject or modify any finding of fact that was not based upon competent substantial evidence. The Hearing Officer\u2019s finding that Walden\u2019s program satisfied the Board\u2019s curricular criteria was based on a misinterpretation of the Board\u2019s rules and was not supported by competent substantial evidence. Accordingly, the Board did not misapply the standards of review in reinstating its denial of Mayer\u2019s application, and the District Court did not err in affirming the Board\u2019s final agency decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-7\">\u00b635 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b404-8\">CHIEF JUSTICEMcGRATH, JUSTICES WHEAT,COTTERand BAKER concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b394-6\"> The curricular rules were <em>not </em>amended during the review of Mayer\u2019s application.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b399-5\"> Although the Board did not specifically use the word \u201ccontinuous,\u201d the Board did cite two pages of the hearing transcript where Dr. Fiore testified that Walden\u2019s residency program is inadequate \u201c[blecause there isn\u2019t continuous enrollment for a[n academic] year.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b400-7\"> There has been no challenge in this case to the validity of the Board\u2019s residency and curricular rules. <em>See Mont.
