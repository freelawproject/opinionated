There were several petitioners in the consolidated proceedings before the District Court, but Park County is the lone appellant. Although Park County raises just one issue on appeal, we do not reach the merits because we conclude that the County may not appeal an issue raised by another party in the consolidated proceedings when it did not raise that issue before the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-5\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b227-6\">\u00b62 Since 2000, the State of Montana has managed the seasonal migration of bison in and around Yellowstone National Park through the Interagency Bison Management Plan (IBMP). The IBMP was not designed as a static document; it allows for changes through Adaptive Management Adjustments (AMAs), which are promulgated by members of the IBMP. The Montana Departments of Fish, Wildlife &amp; Parks (FWP) and Livestock, among others, are members of the IBMP.</p>\n<p id=\"Ato\">\u00b63 In 2011, the IBMP partners proposed an AMA that expanded the area in the Gardiner basin where migrating bison would be managed and tolerated during certain times of the year. The decision to expand the territory in which bison were allowed to naturally migrate prompted various petitioners to bring suit to prevent its implementation.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-7\">\u00b64 A petition was filed by Park County Stockgrowers Association for declaratory and injunctive relief based on the AMA\u2019s failure to comply with the Montana Environmental Policy Act, Montana\u2019s constitutional right to a clean and healthful environment, and various statutory obligations. The Stockgrowers Association\u2019s petition also raised a public nuisance claim. Several days later, Park County filed a separate petition, seeking a declaratory ruling that the implementation of the 2011 AMA was a public nuisance and requesting injunctive relief on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>that basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-4\">\u00b65 The District Court consolidated Park County\u2019s petition with the Stockgrowers Association\u2019s in an uncontested order on June 16,2011. The court also granted the Montana Farm Bureau Federation\u2019s motion to intervene as a petitioner and Bear Creek Council, Greater Yellowstone Coalition, and Natural Resources Defense Council's motion to intervene as defendants in both cases. The court granted Western Watersheds Project and Buffalo Field Campaign\u2019s motion to intervene as defendants in both cases on August 9,2011.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-5\">\u00b66 The Farm Bureau and the Stockgrowers Association filed a joint amended petition on April 2, 2012. The amended petition added a claim based on changes to \u00a7 87-1-216, MCA, made by Mont. Sen. 212, 62d Legis., Reg. Sess. (Jan. 21, 2011) (SB 212), which recently had been enacted by the Legislature and signed into law by the Governor. Park County did not join in the amended petition or amend its own petition to state a claim based on \u00a7 87-1-216, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-6\">\u00b67 The court held a hearing on the merits of all claims on August 14 through 17 and November 5,2012. Park County raised only its public nuisance claim at the hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-7\">\u00b68 The District Court entered extensive findings of fact and conclusions of law on January 7,2013, rejecting all of the claims and dismissing all of the petitions. The court ruled in part that \u00a7 87-1-216, MCA, prohibited FWP from releasing, transplanting or allowing wild bison on any private or public land, but did not apply to the release of naturally migrating bison from Yellowstone National Park. Park County filed a timely appeal. In its amended notice of appeal, Park County wrote that the Stockgrowers Association had filed a notice of appeal; this Court\u2019s record reflects, however, that the Stockgrowers Association never did appeal. Neither the Stockgrowers Association nor the Farm Bureau joined in Park County\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-8\">\u00b69 The only issue Park County raises on appeal is whether the District Court erred in its interpretation of \u00a7 87-1-216, MCA, as it applies to the State\u2019s management of wild bison in the Gardiner Basin. Although Park County relied exclusively on its nuisance claim at trial, Park County does not appeal the denial of its nuisance claim. Rather, it argues on appeal that the court violated recognized rules of statutory construction by considering the legislative history of \u00a7 87-1-216, MCA, without first conducting a plain language analysis. Although the Stockgrowers Association and Farm Bureau raised the issue in the consolidated case, Park County neither raised a claim based on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>\u00a7 87-1-216, MCA, in the proceedings before the District Court, nor adopted the arguments of the other petitioners.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-3\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b229-4\">\u00b610 Invoking our longstanding rule that a party who fails to raise a claim in the district court is barred from raising the claim for the first time on appeal, the Appellees argue that Park County\u2019s failure to raise the plain language issue before the District Court should prevent the County from raising the issue on appeal. <em>Mysse v. Martens, </em>279 Mont. 253, 267, 926 P.2d 765, 773 (1996). We have held, \u201c[W]here a party fails to raise an issue in the pleadings, does not present argument on the issue during the hearing on the merits of the case, does not move to amend the pleadings to conform to any evidence presented and raises the issue for the first time in a post-hearing memorandum which the district court does not address in its order, the issue has not been timely raised and may not be raised on appeal.\u201d <em>Nason v. Leistiko, </em>1998 MT 217, \u00b6 18, 290 Mont. 460, 963 P.2d 1279. We have not addressed, however, the question whether consolidation of separate actions allows a party who did not expressly adopt the position of another party in a consolidated case to appeal the issues raised only by that other party when the other party chooses not to appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-5\">\u00b611 Consolidation is governed by M. R. Civ. P. 42(a), which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A98\">(a) Consolidation. If actions before the court involve a common question of law or fact, the court may:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-6\">(1) join for hearing or trial any or all matters at issue in the actions;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-7\">(2) consolidate the actions; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-8\">(3) issue any other orders to avoid unnecessary cost or delay.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ap\">We have suggested that the purpose of consolidation under this rule is to \u201cpermit trial convenience and economy in administration by avoiding unnecessary costs or delay.\u201d <em>Means v. Mont. Power Co., </em>191 Mont. 395, 401, 625 P.2d 32, 36 (1981). Prior to adoption of the rule\u2019s federal counterpart, the U.S. Supreme Court observed that \u201cconsolidation is permitted as a matter of convenience and economy in administration, hut does not merge the suits into a single cause, or change the rights of the parties, or make those who are parties in one suit parties in another.\u201d <em>Johnson v. Manhattan R. Co., </em>289 U.S. 479, 496-97, 53 S. Ct. 721, 727-28 (1933).</p>\n<p id=\"b229-9\">\u00b612 Since the enactment of Rule 42, federal courts repeatedly have cited <em>Johnson </em>to show that consolidation does not alter the distinct <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>rights of various parties or make a party to one suit a party to the other. <em>Geddes v. United Fin. Group, </em>559 F.2d 557, 561 (9th Cir. 1977); <em>Greenberg v. Giannini, </em>140 F.2d 550, 552 (2d Cir. 1944); <em>see generally </em>Charles Alan Wright &amp; Arthur R. Miller, <em>Federal Practice and Procedure, </em>vol. 9A, \u00a7 2382 at 10-13 (3d ed., West 2008). The Ninth Circuit has noted, \u201c[T]he law is clear that an act of consolidation does not affect any of the substantive rights of the parties.\u201d <em>J. G. Link &amp; Co. v. Contl. Cas. Co., </em>470 F.2d 1133, 1138 (9th Cir. 1972). Construing a similar state rule of procedure, and relying on <em>Johnson, </em>the court in <em>Knowlton v. Ward, </em>889 S.W.2d 721, 728 (Ark. 1994), held that consolidation for trial purposes did not allow a party \u201cto raise on appeal an issue that she did not present at trial.\u201d The court noted that \u201cKnowlton was not a party to the [consolidated] UCAC lawsuit and did not join in UCAC\u2019s motion for summary judgment[.]\u201d <em>Knowlton, </em>889 S.W.2d at 728.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-3\">\u00b613 Montana\u2019s Rule 42(a) is identical to the corresponding federal rule. We have looked to the federal courts for guidance in our interpretation of our own Rule 42 in the past. <em>Yellowstone Co. v. Drew, </em>2007 MT 130, \u00b6 14, 337 Mont. 346, 160 P.3d 557. Viewed together with our previous pronouncement that consolidation is for the convenience and economy in administration of the district court, we find persuasive the federal precedent on this issue. The consolidation of two distinct actions does not change the rules of pleading or the rights of the parties. The parties\u2019 rights still turn on the pleadings, proof, and proceedings in their respective causes. Park County never amended its complaint to include a claim involving \u00a7 87-1-216, MCA. Park County did not join in the Stockgrowers Association\u2019s original petition or in the amended petition filed by the Stockgrowers Association and the Farm Bureau after consolidation.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-4\">\u00b614 Without any citation to the record, Park County argues that it presented argument on the issue it now raises during the hearing and that it raised the issue prior to the post-trial briefing. During its opening statements at the hearing, however, Park County stated, \u201cOur claim is public nuisance.\u201d It proceeded to argue for relief based only on its public nuisance claim. Park County argues that it raised the issue when it worked with other petitioners to draft proposed findings and conclusions for the District Court. The parties\u2019 collaboration in drafting the order at the court\u2019s direction, however, does not allow Park County to overcome its failure to plead, brief, argue or admit any evidence regarding the issue it now seeks to appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>\u00b615  Park County posits that the \u201cfirst determination here is whether a consolidated matter entitles each party to adopt the positions of fellow party members.\u201d This misstates the issue here, which is not whether Park County could have adopted another petitioner\u2019s arguments, but instead \u2014 in light of the fact that Park County never actually adopted a fellow party\u2019s argument \u2014 whether Park County may appeal an issue it did not raise before the District Court. We hold that it may not.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-5\">\u00b616 Finally, Park County warns that our decision will have a \u201cchilling effect\u201d that will unfairly obstruct parties in consolidated cases from proper review of potential errors, citing <em>In re Matter </em>of B.B., 2001 MT 285, 307 Mont. 397, 37 P.3d 715. The cited case did not involve consolidation and does not support Park County\u2019s position. Park County could have amended its pleadings to incorporate the arguments raised in the consolidated case or joined in the motions of the other petitioners before the District Court. Our decision will not prevent parties from appealing issues that they properly presented to the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-6\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b231-7\">\u00b617  Consolidation does not permit Park County to appeal an issue raised in a separate case by another party. As no other exception is taken to the District Court\u2019s judgment by any party to the proceedings, the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b231-8\">JUSTICES WHEAT, COTTER, McKINNON and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
