Because J.S. is an \u201cIndian child,\u201d as defined in 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1903(4),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the Indian Child Welfare Act (ICWA), 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1901 et seq., applies. We affirm the District Court and restate S.F.\u2019s issues on appeal as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b356-7\">\u00b62 <em>1. Did the State violate ICWA by failing to provide proper notice to S.F. and his tribe?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b356-8\">\u00b63 <em>2. Did the State violate ICWA by failing to make active efforts to provide services and promote the relationship between S.F. and J.S. ?</em></p>\n<p id=\"ABk\">\u00b64 <em>3. Did the State violate ICWA by failing to provide proper expert testimony for establishing guardianship and the continued placement of J.S. outside S.F.\u2019s care?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b356-9\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b356-10\">\u00b65 J.S.\u2019s father, S.F., is an enrolled member of the Curyung Tribe, located in Dillingham, Alaska. J.S.\u2019s biological mother, B.S., is an enrolled member of the Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes. J.S. was bom in 1998 and is currently an enrolled member of the Curyung Tribe (J.S. enrolled on June 11,2008). In 2001, the State removed J.S. from B.S.\u2019s care, in Ronan. At that time, J.S.\u2019s father was unknown. In February 2002, J.S. was adjudicated a youth in need of care, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>temporary legal custody was granted to the Department of Public Health and Human Services (the Department). B.S. eventually named S.F. as the putative father, and on September 9, 2002, S.F. was personally served with notice of the Department\u2019s petition to extend its temporaiy legal custody over J.S. S.F. did not appear at the hearing, and his default was entered. The District Court granted a motion to intervene by the Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes on February 7,2003.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-5\">\u00b66 In March 2003, B.S.\u2019s parental rights were terminated. The Department made several attempts to conclusively identify J.S.\u2019s father, but it was not until September 2004 that a paternity test confirmed that S.F. was J.S.\u2019s biological father. On March22,2006, the Department facilitated contact between S.F. and J.S. On May31,2006, the Department placed J.S. in foster care with D.Y. and S.Y. (the foster family), along with other of J.S.\u2019s siblings. The foster family had previously adopted two of J.S.\u2019s siblings.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-6\">\u00b67 On August 21,2006, the Department filed a petition to terminate S.F.\u2019s parental rights, alleging that he had failed to establish a relationship with J.S. or prove that he intended to care for him. S.F. was personally served with notice of the termination hearing, but there is no evidence that the Curyung Tribe ever received notice. S.F. appeared at the hearing and obtained counsel. The District Court extended the hearing three times to allow S.F. to complete a treatment plan. In October 2006, the Department filed a motion to dismiss its petition to terminate S.F.\u2019s parental rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-7\">\u00b68 In December 2007, the Department again moved to terminate S.F.\u2019s parental rights due to his failure to maintain contact with the Department. S.F. was served, and notice was sent to the Curyung Tribe of the termination proceedings. On February 14,2008, the court granted the Curyung Tribe\u2019s motion to intervene. S.F. moved to dismiss the petition, arguing that the Department had failed to comply with ICWA. The Department stipulated to dismissal and agreed to create a treatment plan for S.F. Subsequently, the Department developed several treatment plans for S.F., but the Department believed that S.F. was not demonstrating an interest in completing them, and none were court approved.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-8\">\u00b69 On March 15,2011, the Department filed a Motion for Hearing to Address Treatment Plan. The Curyung Tribe received notice of the hearing by certified mail. During the hearing, the Department sought to obtain court approval of a treatment plan. S.F. objected and stated that he would not work certain components of the plan because \u201che <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>could teach the classes that they want him to attend.\u201d The court approved a treatment plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-5\">\u00b610 On November 16, 2011, the Department filed another motion to terminate S.F.\u2019s parental rights. The child protection specialist\u2019s report to the court indicated that S.F. had made no effort to visit with J.S., was unwilling to complete the treatment plan, and had made representations through counsel that he wished to relinquish his rights. The court denied the Department\u2019s termination request during an April 12,2012 hearing because the Department had failed to cedi an ICWA expert familiar with the customs and culture of the Curyung Tribe. Instead, the court extended temporary legal custody over J.S. for three months and ordered that the treatment plan be revised to include specific dates for the completion of tasks. The court also directed the Department to make active efforts to assist S.F. in completing the plan. The Department then attempted to facilitate communication between S.F. and J.S. by suggesting that S.F. write a letter to J.S. and call him.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-6\">\u00b611 On July 3,2012, the Department filed a Notice of Filing indicating that S.F. had completed many aspects of his treatment plan, but failed to follow through on several others. On July 19,2012, the court held a permanency plan hearing. J.S., then fourteen years old, indicated to the court that he wished to remain with his siblings and the foster family, where he had been living for the past six years. The court approved a permanency plan in the alternative \u2014 reunification with S.F. or guardianship with the foster family. On July 30, 2012, the Department filed a petition requesting an additional six months for S.F. to complete his treatment plan. In August 2012, S.F. and J.S. met with their attorneys present, and then attended two counseling sessions dining the fall of 2012.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-7\">\u00b612 On November 14,2012, the Department filed a Petition for Legal Guardianship. S.F. objected and petitioned to transfer jurisdiction to the Curyung Tribe. On December 13, 2012, the court sent notice by certified mail to the Curyung Tribe. A transfer hearing was held, wherein tribal representatives testified that the Curyung Tribe did not wish to accept jurisdiction and supported granting guardianship of J.S. to the foster family. The court denied S.F.\u2019s transfer request and conducted a guardianship hearing on March 14,2013. Testimony was received from Nikki Grossberg (Grossberg), Regional Administrator for the Department, and Chris Itumulria (Itumulria), a Tribal Children\u2019s Service Worker for the Curyung Tribe. Grossberg testified that J.S. had consistently expressed a desire to remain with the foster family. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>Itumulria testified as an ICWA expert, over the objection of S.F., that the Curyung Tribe supported guardianship. Itumulria noted that J.S. had been \u201cin the system for 11 years\u201d and opined that removing him from foster care \u201cat this time would do some serious emotional harm.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AVW\">\u00b613 On July 26, 2013, the court issued its Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law and Decree of Guardianship. The court ultimately determined to grant guardianship over J.S. to the foster family. S.F. appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-4\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">\u00b614 We review a district court\u2019s findings of fact to determine if they are clearly erroneous. <em>In re J.W.C., </em>2011 MT 312, \u00b6 15, 363 Mont. 85, 265 P.3d 1265. Findings of fact are clearly erroneous if they are not supported by substantial evidence, if the district court misapprehended the effect of the evidence, or if this Court is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed. <em>In re G.S., </em>2002 MT 245, \u00b6 24, 312 Mont. 108, 59 P.3d 1063.

Section 41-3-444(1), MCA. Such guardianships are authorized upon the court\u2019s findings that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b359-8\">(a) the department has given its written consent to the appointment of the guardian, whether the guardianship is to be subsidized or not;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b359-9\">(b) if the guardianship is to be subsidized, the department has given its written consent after the department has considered initiating or continuing financial subsidies pursuant to subsection (9);</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b359-10\">(c) the child has been adjudicated a youth in need of care;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b359-11\">(d) the department has made reasonable efforts to reunite the parent and child, further efforts to reunite the parent and child by the department would likely be unproductive, and reunification of the parent and child would be contrary to the best interests of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>the child;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-4\">(e) the child has lived with the potential guardian in a family setting and the potential guardian is committed to providing a long-term relationship with the child;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-5\">(f) it is in the best interests of the child to remain or be placed with the potential guardian;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-6\">(g) either termination of parental rights to the child is not in the child\u2019s best interests or parental rights to the child have been terminated, but adoption is not in the child\u2019s best interests; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-7\">(h) if the child concerning whom the petition for guardianship has been filed is an Indian child, as defined in the Indian Child Welfare Act, 25 U.S.C. 1901, et seq., the child\u2019s tribe has received notification from the state of the initiation of the proceedings.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b360-8\">Section 41-3-444(2), MCA. S.F. does not argue that the District Court\u2019s award of guardianship to the foster family violated state law. Rather, S.F. focuses on federal law, contending that the Department\u2019s failure to comply with ICWA \u201ctainted the entire proceedings.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b360-9\">\u00b616 ICWA establishes the \u201cminimum Federal standards for the removal of Indian children from their families and the placement of such children in foster or adoptive homes ... .\u201d 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1902. Congress designed ICWA \u201cprimarily to counteract the unwarranted <em>removal </em>of Indian children from Indian families.\u201d <em>Adoptive Couple v. Baby Girl, </em>570 U.S._, 133 S. Ct. 2552, 2555 (2013) (citation omitted) (emphasis in original). To that end,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-12\">[a]ny Indian child who is the subject of any action for foster care placement or termination of parental rights under State law, any parent or Indian custodian from whose custody such child was removed, and the Indian child\u2019s tribe may petition any court of competent jurisdiction to invalidate such action upon a showing that such action violated any provision of... this Act.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b360-13\">25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1914. While ICWA requires state courts to follow \u201c \u2018strict procedures\u2019 \u201d and \u201c \u201cmeet stringent requirements,\u2019 \u201d <em>In re K.B., </em>2013 MT 133, \u00b6 21, 370 Mont. 254, 301 P.3d 836 (citation omitted), it \u201cdoes not provide for invalidation of a valid separate action because of an invalid prior one,\u201d <em>In re M.E.M., </em>209 Mont. 192, 196, 679 P.2d 1241, 1243 (1984) (determining that alleged violations of ICWA during the temporary custody proceedings did not invalidate the properly conducted permanent custody proceedings); <em>see also D.E.D. v. State, </em>704 P.2d 774, 782 (Alaska 1985) (concluding that \u201ceven if the procedural and jurisdictional defects asserted by [the appellant] existed in the earlier temporary custody hearings, they were cured by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>the subsequent procedurally correct final dispositional hearing.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b361-5\">\u00b617 <em>1. Did the State violate ICWA by failing to provide proper notice to S.F. and his tribe?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b361-6\">\u00b618 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1912(a) provides as follows regarding notice:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b361-7\">In any involuntary proceeding in a State court, where the court knows or has reason to know that an Indian child is involved, the party seeking the foster care placement of, or termination of parental rights to, an Indian child <em>shall notify the parent or Indian custodian and the Indian child\u2019s tribe, by registered mail with return receipt requested, of the pending proceedings and of their right of intervention. </em>If the identity or location of the parent or Indian custodian and the tribe cannot be determined, such notice shall be given to the Secretary in like manner, who shall have fifteen days after receipt to provide the requisite notice to the parent or Indian custodian and the tribe. No foster care placement or termination of parental rights proceeding shall be held until at least ten days after receipt of notice by the parent or Indian custodian and the tribe or the Secretary: <em>Provided, </em>That the parent or Indian custodian or the tribe shall, upon request, be granted up to twenty additional days to prepare for such proceeding.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b361-8\">(Emphasis added.) ICWA, therefore, requires that notice be provided to both the \u201cparent\u201d and the \u201cIndian child\u2019s tribe.\u201d The \u201cparent\u201d means \u201cany biological parent or parents of an Indian child or any Indian person who has lawfully adopted an Indian child, including adoptions under tribal law or custom. It does not include the unwed father where paternity has not been acknowledged or established.\u201d 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1903(9). The \u201cIndian child\u2019s tribe\u201d means \u201c(a) the Indian tribe in which an Indian child is a member or eligible for membership or (b), in the case of an Indian child who is a member of or eligible for membership in more than one tribe, the Indian tribe with which the Indian child has the more significant contacts.\u201d 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1903(5).</p>\n<p id=\"Aq7\">\u00b619 S.F. argues that \u201c[a]lthough the State did provide notice to [S.F.], the notice did not comply with the ICWA\u201d because it did not contain information about \u201chis right to intervene, to contest the proceedings, to have counsel or the application of the ICWA.\u201d Moreover, according to S.F., both he and the Curyung Tribe should have received notice \u201cupon the establishment of paternity in September 2004[,] ... upon petition for appointment of a surrogate parent in 2005, upon placement of J.S. in a new, non-ICWA compliant foster home in May 2006, upon filing of the August 2006 petition to terminate parental <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>rights, and upon filing of the November 2007 petition to terminate [S.F.\u2019s] parental rights.\u201d The State\u2019s failure to provide adequate notice, he alleges, \u201cadversely affected the Curyung Tribe\u2019s ability to participate, advocate and protect the rights of [S.F.] as a tribal member.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b362-4\">\u00b620 The State responds that S.F. was not initially considered a \u201cparent\u201d under 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1903(9) because paternity had not been established, but even so, he received \u201cpersonal notice of the proceeding in 2002.\u201d After S.F. was identified as J.S.\u2019s biological father in 2004, \u201conly two permanency plan hearings took place without S.F. being notified.\u201d According to the State, \u201cany deficiencies in providing notice to S.F. during the temporary custody proceedings were later cured by subsequent notifications.\u201d The State points to the fact that from August 2006 forward, S.F. and his counsel received proper notice of all proceedings, including the final guardianship hearing, which S.F. did not attend. Likewise, the State maintains that the Curyung Tribe \u201cwas properly served for all proceedings from 2008 onward,\u201d and any delay \u201cprior to the final dispositional petition is not justification for invalidating the final guardianship hearing.\u201d We agree with the State\u2019s argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-5\">\u00b621 With regard to S.F., although the State failed to provide notice between the establishment of paternity in September 2004 and the August 2006 termination proceeding, S.F. received personal notice of the State\u2019s petition for temporary legal custody in September 2002. At that point, S.F. was merely a putative father and not entitled to notice under 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1903(9). Nonetheless, S.F. was served, and he failed to appear at the hearing. The record also indicates that S.F. received notice of each of the State\u2019s petitions to terminate his parental rights between 2006 and 2011. He likewise received notice of, and actively participated in, the permanency plan and treatment plan proceedings between 2009 and 2012. Finally, and importantly, S.F. received notice of the guardianship hearing, but once again failed to appear. While S.F. is correct that 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1912(a) requires notice of the right to intervene, he fails to cite any authority supporting his position that the State was required to provide information about his right to contest the proceedings, his right to counsel, or the application of ICWA. In any event, S.F.\u2019s argument on this point is unavailing because he did intervene, was represented by counsel throughout these proceedings, and raised his ICWA concerns on several occasions.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-6\">\u00b622 The Curyung Tribe received notice of the State\u2019s petition to terminate S.F.\u2019s parental rights in December 2007 and formally <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>intervened in February 2008. The record establishes that the Curyung Tribe continued to receive notice of all subsequent proceedings and actively participated in this case. During the guardianship hearing, tribal representative Itumuliia testified that \u201c[t]he tribal court formed an opinion to go along with the guardianship with the [foster family].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"ALb\">\u00b623  As noted above, we generally will not overturn valid proceedings based on invalid prior proceedings. <em>In re M.E.M., </em>209 Mont. at 195-96, 679 P.2d at 1243. We conclude that the State\u2019s failure to provide notice at the outset of these proceedings does not provide a basis to overturn the District Court\u2019s ultimate guardianship order. Both S.F. and the Curyung Tribe participated extensively in this case, and S.F. was afforded numerous opportunities to complete a treatment plan, but failed to do so. Any initial shortcomings on the part of the State were subsequently cured, satisfying the notice requirements of ICWA at the time of the guardianship hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-4\">\u00b624 <em>2. Did the State violate ICWA by failing to make active efforts to provide services and promote the relationship between S.F. and J.S.?</em></p>\n<p id=\"AIN\">\u00b625 ICWA provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b363-5\">[a]ny party seeking to effect a foster care placement of, or termination of parental rights to, an Indian child under State law shall satisfy the court that active efforts have been made to provide remedial services and rehabilitative programs designed to prevent the breakup of the Indian family and that these efforts have proved unsuccessful.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b363-6\">25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1912(d) (hereinafter, \u00a7 1912(d)). While \u00a7 1912(d) does not set forth detailed criteria for determining whether \u201cactive efforts\u201d have been made, a \u201c[c]ommon sense construction of the meaning of\u2018active efforts\u2019 requires only that \u2018timely affirmative steps be taken to accomplish the goal which Congress has set: to avoid the breakup of Indian families whenever possible by providing services designated to remedy problems which might lead to severance of the parent-child relationship.\u2019 \u201d <em>In re G.S., </em>\u00b6 36 (citation omitted). Under this standard, the State must do more than simply \u201cgive[ ] the parent a treatment plan and wait[ ] for him to complete it\u201d \u2014 rather, \u00a7 1912(d) \u201cimplies heightened responsibility.\u201d <em>In re A.N., </em>2005 MT 19, \u00b6 23, 325 Mont. 379, 106 P.3d 556. However, \u201ca parent\u2019s demonstrated apathy and indifference to participating in treatment\u201d may be considered by a district court in determining whether the State has made \u201cactive efforts.\u201d <em>In re </em>A.N., \u00b6 23 (citation omitted). So too, a court may consider actions taken by the State to provide services for the other parent and the child. <em>In re D.S.B., </em>2013 MT 112, \u00b6 17, 370 Mont. 37, 300 P.3d 702.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>\u00b626 S.F. claims that from the time he was identified as J.S.\u2019s putative father in 2002, through April 2012, the State failed to satisfy its duly to make \u201cactive efforts.\u201d S.F. explains that \u201cmore than five (5) years passed between the establishment of paternity and the time that the State moved the district court to adopt a treatment plan.\u201d He argues that after the Court ordered the treatment plan, the State did not assist him in completing it, and cites the following statements of the District Court during the termination hearing on April 12,2012:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b364-5\">So the issue that remains is did the State do what they had agreed to on the parenting plan so that they actually handled their responsibilities especially under ICWA. And it appears to the Court based on the testimony that they did not.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b364-6\">I think the problem I\u2019ve got, though, based on the testimony, unless there\u2019s testimony from the State with regard to the active involvement of the child protective specialist. I mean, based on the testimony of the State\u2019s expert in that area she indicated that she did not in fact do any of those things. That makes it very difficult for the Court to find that.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b364-7\">S.F. maintains that efforts made by the State later in the process did not erase the State\u2019s \u201cdecade long failure to comply with the active efforts requirement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b364-8\">\u00b627 The State responds that the Department provided services specific to S.F., but S.F. \u201cfailed to avail himself of those services and showed little or no interest in parenting J.S.\u201d The State notes that it created three informal treatment plans for S.F. between 2006 and 2012, and set up \u201cfamily counseling, encourag[ed] letter writing, and connect[ed] the foster family with S.F. to further open up communication opportunities.\u201d The State points out that S.F. made clear that he did not intend to participate in parenting education, advised the court that he wished to relinquish his parental rights, failed to maintain consistent contact with the Department, and communicated minimally with J.S. Finally, the State argues that we must consider its efforts to provide services for B.S., J.S., and his siblings \u2014 \u201c[t]he Department made active efforts with the mother (provided treatment plans, visits, consulted with the CSKT, <em>etc.) </em>and placed the children with approval of the children\u2019s tribes throughout these proceedings.\u201d Alternatively, the State draws our attention to the United States Supreme Court\u2019s recent holding in <em>Baby Girl, </em>which the District Court also discussed at length.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-9\">\u00b628 While the State made efforts to connect S.F. with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>J.S. \u2014 specifically, followingthe April 2012 termination proceeding \u2014 we conclude that the holding in <em>Baby Girl </em>is dispositive. In <em>Baby Girl, </em>Biological Father and Birth Mother<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> separated after Birth Mother became pregnant with Baby Girl, an Indian child. Via text message, Birth Mother asked Biological Father if he would rather pay child support or relinquish his parental rights. Biological Father responded that he would relinquish his parental rights. Birth Mother then decided to give Baby Girl up through adoption. Birth Mother selected a non-Indian adoptive couple, who supported her emotionally and financially throughout her pregnancy and were present at the time of the child\u2019s birth. Biological Father failed to provide financial assistance to Birth Mother dining her pregnancy and in the months following Baby Girl\u2019s birth. He also \u201c \u2018made no meaningful attempts to assume his responsibility of parenthood\u2019 during this period.\u201d <em>Baby Girl, </em>570 U.S. at_, 133 S. Ct. at 2558. In the subsequent adoption proceedings, Biological Father refused to consent to the adoption and sought custody of Baby Girl. Following trial, the South Carolina Family Court awarded custody of Baby Girl to Biological father, even though she was 27 months old and had never met him. The South Carolina Supreme Court affirmed, holding that the adoptive couple had not shown that \u201c \u2018active efforts ha[d] been made to provide remedial services and rehabilitative programs designed to prevent the breakup of the Indian family\u2019 \u201d pursuant to \u00a7 1912(d). <em>Baby Girl, </em>570 U.S. at_, 133 S. Ct. at 2559.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-9\">\u00b629 On appeal, the United States Supreme Court reversed, concluding that \u00a7 1912(d) did not apply to Baby Girl\u2019s situation. The Court held that \u201c\u00a7 1912(d) applies only in cases where an Indian family\u2019s \u2018breakup\u2019 would be precipitated by the termination of the parent\u2019s rights.\u201d <em>Baby Girl, </em>570 U.S. at_, 133 S. Ct. at 2562. The Court defined \u201cbreakup\u201d to mean \u201c \u2018[t]he discontinuance of a relationship\u2019 \u201d or \u201c \u2018an ending as an effective entity.\u2019 \u201d <em>Baby Girl, </em>570 U.S. at_, 133 S. Ct. at 2562 (citations omitted). Under this definition, \u201cwhen an Indian parent abandons an Indian child prior to birth and that child has never been in the Indian parent\u2019s legal or physical custody, there is no \u2018relationship\u2019 that would be \u2018discontinu[ed]\u2019 \u2014 and no \u2018effective entity5 that would be \u2018end[ed]\u2019 \u2014 by the termination of the Indian parent\u2019s rights.\u201d In such circumstances, the \u201c *breakup of the Indian family5 has long since occurred, and \u00a7 1912(d) is inapplicable.\u201d <em>Baby Girl, </em>570 U.S. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>at_,133 S. Ct. at 2562.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-5\">\u00b630 The facts in <em>Baby Girl </em>are similar to those here. Like Biological Father, S.F. never obtained legal or physical custody of J.S. and did not initiate a relationship with J.S. until many years after his birth. The record indicates that the State first facilitated a visit between S.F. and J.S. on March 22,2006, nearly two years after paternity had been established and over eight years after J.S. was bom \u2014 a long delay that occurred despite the fact that S.F. acknowledged, \u201cI was aware before [J.S.] was bom [J.S.] was my son.\u201d After he made initial contact with J.S., S.F. refused to complete remedial parenting classes and indicated multiple times during multiple hearings that he wished to relinquish his parental rights. The District Court accurately described the relationship between S.F. and J.S. as \u201cnon-existen[t],\u201d and recognized that the Department \u201ccannot force the creation of a personal relationship between a Youth and his estranged father where none has previously existed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b366-6\">\u00b631  Although <em>Baby Girl </em>dealt with termination of parental rights instead of a guardianship, \u00a7 1912(d), by its terms, applies equally in both instances. Where, as here, the \u201c \u201cbreakup of the Indian family\u2019 has long since occurred,\u201d we will not apply \u00a7 1912(d) to reverse an otherwise validly established guardianship. <em>See Baby Girl, </em>570 U.S. at _, 133 S. Ct. at 2562. As the United States Supreme Court noted, the explicit congressional purpose of ICWA is to provide \u201ccertain \u2018standards for the <em>removal </em>of Indian children from their families.\u2019 \u201d <em>Baby Girl, </em>570 U.S. at_, 133 S. Ct. at 2563 (citations omitted) (emphasis in original). ICWA was never intended to \u201cfacilitate a <em>transfer </em>of the child <em>to </em>an Indian parent.\u201d <em>Baby Girl, </em>570 U.S. at_, 133 S. Ct. at 2563 (citing 44 Fed. Reg. 67584, 67592 (Nov. 26, 1979)) (emphasis in original). Given the non-existent relationship between S.F. and J.S., and their very limited personal contact throughout these proceedings, we conclude that \u00a7 1912(d) does not provide a basis to overturn the District Court\u2019s award of guardianship to the foster family based on the State\u2019s alleged failure to make \u201cactive efforts.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"ApL\">\u00b632 3. <em>Did the State violate ICWA by failing to provide proper expert testimony for establishing guardianship and the continued placement of J.S. outside S.F.\u2019s care?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b366-13\">\u00b633 ICWA requires testimony from a qualified expert in order to effect the foster care placement of a child:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b366-14\">No foster care placement may be ordered in such proceeding in the absence of a determination, supported by clear and convincing evidence, including testimony of qualified expert witnesses, that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>the continued custody of the child by the parent or Indian custodian is likely to result in serious emotioned or physical damage to the child.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b367-5\">25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1912(e) (hereinafter \u00a7 1912(e)). Although expert testimony is necessary, a court need not base its decision on expert testimony alone. <em>In re D.S.B., </em>\u00b6 18. A court may consider all of the evidence properly before it. <em>In re D.S.B., </em>\u00b6 19.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-6\">\u00b634 S.F. argues that the expert testimony presented at the guardianship hearing \u201cfalls short of the requirement set forth by the ICWA.\u201d He maintains that Itumulria merely referenced \u201cthe length of time that J.S. had been in the system in response to inquiry of potential emotional or physical harm. There was no testimony that identified any conduct or condition of the Father likely to cause emotional or physical harm.\u201d He cites <em>In re K.B., </em>\u00b6 28 for the proposition that \u201c \u2018failure to elicit expert testimony regarding whether continued custody will result in serious emotional or physical damage to the children requires reversal....\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b367-7\">\u00b635 The State responds that Itumulria was a qualified ICWA expert, with personal knowledge of the Curyung Tribe\u2019s customs and cultural standards, and over twenty years of experience. According to the State, the District Court properly considered Iumulria\u2019s testimony in conjunction with the testimony of others, the case record, and J.S.\u2019s wishes when it concluded that \u201cpermitting S.F. to have custody of J.S. would likely result in serious emotional or physical irjury to the child.\u201d Alternatively, the State again cites the District Court\u2019s discussion of <em>Baby Girl </em>and its determination that \u00a7 1912(e) does not apply in this case because S.F. never had custody of J.S.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-8\">\u00b636 In addition to addressing the \u201cactive efforts\u201d requirement of \u00a7 1912(d), <em>Baby Girl </em>analyzed the \u201ccontinued custody\u201d provision in 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1912(f) (hereinafter \u00a7 1912(f)). Similar to the wording in \u00a7 1912(e), cited above, \u00a7 1912(f) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b367-9\">No termination of parental rights may be ordered in such proceeding in the absence of a determination, supported by evidence beyond a reasonable doubt, including testimony of qualified expert witnesses, that the continued custody of the child by the parent or Indian custodian is likely to result in serious emotional or physical damage to the child.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b367-10\">The Supreme Court explained that \u00a7 1912(f) \u201cconditions the involuntary termination of parental rights on a showing regarding the merits of <em>\u2018continued </em>custody of the child by the parent.\u2019 \u201d <em>Baby Girl, </em>570 U.S. at_, 133 S. Ct. at 2560 (emphasis in original). Because the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>\u201cadjective \u2018continued\u2019 plainly refers to a pre-existing state ... [t]he phrase \u2018continued custody* [] refers to custody that a parent already has (or at least had at some point in the past).\u201d <em>Baby Girl, </em>570 U.S. at _, 133 S. Ct. at 2560. Given this construction, the Supreme Court held that \u201c\u00a7 1912(f) does not apply in cases where the Indian parent <em>never </em>had custody of the Indian child.\u201d <em>Baby Girl, </em>570 U.S. at_, 133 S. Ct. at 2560 (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b368-9\">\u00b637  The similar provision of \u00a7 1912(e) conditions the placement of a child into foster care \u201con a showing regarding the merits of <em>\u2018continued, </em>custody.\u2019 \u201d The only substantive difference between \u00a7 1912(f) and \u00a7 1912(e) is their respective standards of proof \u2014 \u00a7 1912(f) requires evidence beyond a reasonable doubt, while \u00a7 1912(e) requires clear and convincing evidence. As we have discussed above, the record in this case clearly establishes that S.F. never had custody of J.S. Indeed, the District Court found that S.F. \u201cwas not involved in the child\u2019s life for the significant part of 15 years and only became interested in the action ten years after significant State involvement refocused his attention to the matter.\u201d Because there is no custody to \u201ccontinue,\u201d we conclude that \u00a7 1912(e) does not apply and does not serve to invalidate the District Court\u2019s award of guardianship.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-10\">\u00b638  Based on ample evidence in the record, we conclude that the District Court appropriately rejected S.F.\u2019s legal arguments and properly determined that guardianship of J.S. by his foster family was appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-11\">\u00b639 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b368-12\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES COTTER, WHEAT and BAKER concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b356-11\"> The term \u201cIndian child\u201d means \u201cany unmarried person who is under age eighteen and is either (a) a member of an Indian tribe or (b) is eligible for membership in an Indian tribe and is the biological child of a member of an Indian tribe.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b365-14\"> These identifying terms were used in <em>Baby Girl, </em>570 U.S. at_, 133 S.
