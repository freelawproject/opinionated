We affirm in part, reverse in part and remand for further proceedings consistent with this Opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-12\">ISSUES</p>\n<p id=\"b136-13\">\u00b62 We review the following issues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b136-14\"><em>1. Did the District Court abuse its discretion and correctly apply this Court\u2019s decision in </em>Anderson <em>when it prohibited Ring from examining the victim out of the presence of the jury regarding alleged false accusations of sexual assault?</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b136-15\">\n<em>2. Did a jury instruction stating that intoxication is not a defense violate Ring\u2019s right to due process, when he testified that he had taken prescription medication?</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>\n<em>3. Did the District Court abuse its discretion when it denied Ring\u2019s motion for a new trial based on an allegation of juror bias?</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-5\">\n<em>4. Did the District Court err when it imposed conditions of the sentence that imposed restitution in an unspecified amount and ordered Ring to pay for the cost of his incarceration?</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b137-6\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b137-7\">\u00b63 On February 2,2011, Ring\u2019s then twenty-four-year-old daughter, S.H., was staying with him with her two children, ages seven and two. S.H. does not own a car. S.H. had come to stay with Ring after a falling out with her mother, with whom she had been staying previously. Another woman and her eight-year-old daughter were also staying in Ring\u2019s three bedroom house at the time. Ring slept in one bedroom, while each woman shared a bedroom with her child or children. The other woman was out of town on February 2, but her daughter was at Ring\u2019s house.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-9\">\u00b64 S.H., Ring, and the children ate dinner, then watched television. S.H. drank some liquor. Around 8:30 or 9:00 p.m., S.H. put the children to bed. After she had put the children to bed, S.H. testified that Ring made her a Captain Morgan spiced rum and water in a \u201cregular-size bar\u201d glass. Then, she went out to the garage and smoked about half a gram of marijuana and a cigarette. When she returned to the house she testified she was \u201cbuzzed,\u201d but not incapacitated. She testified that Ring handed her a third, stronger, Captain Morgan and water drink. She was sipping it, then chugged it after Ring made fun of her for drinking it too slowly. After chugging the drink, S.H. testified, she was \u201cpretty much black-out drunk.\u201d She testified that she got up and went to sleep in Ring\u2019s bed because she did not want to disturb her sleeping children. She \u201cpretty much laid down and passed out\u201d with all her clothes on. She testified: \u201cI remember waking up with-with him on top of me.... And, like, I couldn\u2019t move. And I didn\u2019t want to scream or do anything because there were kids in the house. I remember heavy breathing and him just kind of talking to himself.\u201d S.H. just laid there and \u201ctook it\u201d because she was \u201cblacked out\u201d and he was too big to push off of her. When \u201ceverything got finished\u201d she went into her bedroom and, at 3:30 in the morning, called people to come pick her up. Her brother came and picked her up at 8:00 a.m. the next day. She showed him some text messages she received from Ring. The messages read:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AEi\">Why did u call patti to come get u at three thirty this morning U started it and it has been along time. If u did not what it to happen all u had to do is say no. I am sorry but it was just as much as me. I think this should be kept between us</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b138-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>When she told her brother what had happened, he called the police.</p>\n<p id=\"AKl\">\u00b65 Ring\u2019s version of events differs. Ring isa veteran who suffers from pain, for which he is prescribed medications. To manage his pain, he is prescribed one hydrocodone pill per day and two Naproxen, twice a day. He testified that he was suffering from pain on February 2,2011, and also had a cold. Before he went to bed, around 11:30 p.m., he had taken four hydrocodone pills, as well as three Naproxen and NyQuil Nighttime. He had been taking Tylenol Cold \u2014 and some morphine \u2014 during the day. He testified that he never poured S.H. any drinks. Instead, he testified that S.H. poured her third drink while she was on the phone with her brother, and that he went to bed before S.H. did. He was wearing his underwear and had put on the breathing machine he uses to treat his sleep apnea. After Ring was asleep, he testified, S.H. came into the room. She woke him up, saying she was cold and asking him to hold her. He said no. She slept on top of the covers with a blanket, initially, but somehow ended up nude, under the covers. He testified that she initiated the sexual contact, but also that he was asleep or barely aware at the time, and that he stopped the contact as soon as he realized what was happening. The next day, when interviewed by a detective, he admitted that he had intercourse with S.H..</p>\n<p id=\"b138-4\">\u00b66 Ring was charged by Amended Information with incest, a felony, in violation of \u00a7 45-5-507, MCA. Following a three-day juiy trial, he was found guilty of the offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-5\">\u00b67 Before trial began, Ring\u2019s counsel filed subpoenas duces tecum to discover evidence related to past, allegedly false, accusations of rape S.H. had made against other men in her life. The State filed a motion in limine to exclude such evidence on the grounds that it would not be admissible at trial. The discovery attempt uncovered a one-page, Child and Family Services report written by a social worker, which referred to one such incident. The allegations referred to in the report, which were not documented in any sort of detail, had not been adjudicated or admitted to be false. On the day trial began, the District Court refused Ring\u2019s counsel\u2019s request to question S.H. to locate documentation of any additional accusations. The court further determined that the evidence pertaining to the documented previous accusation was not admissible, pursuant to this Court\u2019s decision in <em>State v. Anderson, </em>211 Mont. 272, 686 P.2d 193 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b138-6\">\u00b68 Over Ring\u2019s objection, the District Court submitted to the jury an instruction concerning the effect of being in an \u201cintoxicated condition,\u201d which essentially reiterated the provisions of \u00a7 45-2-203, MCA. The juiy instruction provided that intoxication from having ingested <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>\u201cintoxicating substances\u201d is not a defense to the mental state element of a crime. The instruction, as permitted by \u00a7\u00a7 45-2-203,45-2-101(32) and 50-32-224(l)(a)(x), MCA, specified that hydrocodone is an \u201cintoxicating substance.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b139-5\">\u00b69 Following Ring\u2019s conviction by the jury, Ring\u2019s counsel learned that one of the jury members had been a victim of incest. The jury member had not disclosed her experience during voir dire. Ring\u2019s counsel moved for a new trial, arguing that the nondisclosure amounted to intentional concealment. The court concluded that investigation of the issue was necessary and conducted a hearing. The juror submitted a statement that Ring\u2019s counsel had never asked whether she had been a victim of incest, only whether she could hear the case fairly and impartially. The juror felt that she could, in part because the incest she experienced happened during childhood, whereas S.H. was an adult. In fact, she had initially doubted that Ring was guilty. The District Court denied Ring\u2019s motion after considering the juror\u2019s statement and the voir dire transcript. The court observed that, because neither counsel asked if any member of the jury pool was a victim of incest, the juror\u2019s decision not to disclose that history was not intentional concealment. In addition, she had shown no indication of bias.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-6\">\u00b6 10 The District Court sentenced Ring to twenty years in the Montana State Prison, imposing twenty-one \u201cconditions\u201d on his sentence. These conditions included requirements that he pay \u201call future medical expenses that his victim can reasonably be expected to incur\u201d as a result of his conduct, as well as \u201call future costs of incarceration and medical costs while incarcerated.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b139-7\">\u00b611 Ring appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-8\">STANDARDS OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b139-9\">\u00b612 This Court reviews a district court\u2019s evidentiary rulings for an abuse of discretion. <em>Puccinelli v. Puccinelli, </em>2012 MT 46, \u00b6 12, 364 Mont. 235, 272 P.3d 117. Notwithstanding this deferential standard, however, judicial discretion must be guided by the rules and principles of law; thus, our standard of review is plenary to the extent that a discretionary ruling is based on a conclusion of law. <em>Puccinelli, </em>\u00b6 12. In such circumstances, we review a district court\u2019s decision de novo, to determine whether the court interpreted the law correctly. <em>Puccinelli, </em>\u00b6 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-10\">\u00b613 We review jury instructions \u201cto determine whether the instructions as a whole folly and fairly instruct the jury on the applicable law.\u201d <em>State v. Myran, </em>2012 MT 252, \u00b6 16, 366 Mont. 532, 289 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>P.3d 118 (quotation omitted). District courts are given broad discretion when instructing a jury and reversible error occurs only if the jury instructions prejudicially affect the defendant\u2019s substantial rights. <em>Myran, </em>\u00b6 16. Statutes are presumed constitutional and the challenger bears the burden of proving that the statute is unconstitutional beyond a reasonable doubt; any doubts are resolved in favor of the statute. <em>Myran, </em>\u00b6 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-4\">\u00b614 A district court\u2019s ruling on a motion for a new trial and its decision as to the impartiality of a jury should not be set aside unless there is an abuse of discretion. <em>State v. Dunfee, </em>2005 MT 147, \u00b6 14, 327 Mont. 335, 114 P.3d 217. The trial court is in the best position to observe the jurors and to decide the potential for prejudice when allegations of juror misconduct are raised. <em>State v. Rennaker, </em>2007 MT 10, \u00b6 29, 335 Mont. 274, 150 P.3d 960. Thus, the trial court\u2019s determination is given considerable weight by this Court and we will defer to the trial court\u2019s determination absent a showing of prejudice. <em>Rennaker, </em>\u00b6 29.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-5\">\u00b615 This Court reviews criminal sentences for legality. <em>State v. Mainwaring, </em>2007 MT 14, \u00b6 7, 335 Mont. 322, 151 P.3d 53. \u201cWhen reviewing sentences for \u201clegality,\u2019 one thing we determine is whether the sentencing court had statutory authority to impose the sentence; in other words, whether the sentence falls within the parameters set by the applicable sentencing statutes.\u201d <em>Mainwaring, </em>\u00b6 7. This presents a question of law, which we review de novo. <em>Mainwaring, </em>\u00b6 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b140-7\">\u00b616 I. <em>Did the District Court abuse its discretion and correctly apply this Court\u2019s decision in </em>Anderson <em>when it prohibited Ring from examining the victim out of the presence of the jury regarding alleged false accusations of sexual assault ?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b140-8\">\u00b617 In <em>Anderson, </em>this Court held that evidence of similar sexual offenses claimed to have been committed against the victim by other individuals is admissible <em>if the offenses were proven or admitted to be </em>false. <em>Anderson, </em>at 284-85, 686 P.2d at 200. Admissible evidence of this nature is limited to that which may be narrowed to the issue of the complaining witness\u2019s veracity. <em>Anderson, </em>211 Mont. at 284, 686 P.2d at 200. Evidence of prior charges which may be true or false is inadmissible. <em>Anderson, </em>211 Mont. at 284-85, 686 P.2d at 200. <em>Anderson </em>also stated that, in order to establish whether there is sufficient support for the contention that the prior allegations are false, a separate hearing outside the jury\u2019s presence should be held. <em>Anderson, </em>211 Mont. at 285, 686 P.2d at 200. One purpose of this rule is to avoid having the trial become \u201ca trial of the victim.\u201d <em>See Anderson, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>211 Mont. at 285, 686 P.2d at 200.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-4\">\u00b618 In <em>State ex rel. Mazurek v. District Court of the Mont. Fourth Judicial Dist., </em>277 Mont. 349, 357, 922 P.2d 474, 479 (1996), we clarified that <em>Anderson </em>requires \u201cthat the district court conduct a hearing outside the presence of the jury to determine whether there is sufficient evidence to support the contention that the allegation was false.\u201d We explained that the hearing must address whether it is proper to question the witness regarding previous accusations, as well as the admissibility of the corroborative evidence. <em>Mazurek, </em>277 Mont. at 358, 922 P.2d at 480. <em>Mazurek </em>adopts the direction articulated by the Nevada Supreme Court that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-5\">In making such a determination, the defendant must establish, by a preponderance of the evidence, that (1) the accusation or accusations were in fact made; (2) that the accusation or accusations were in fact false; and (3) that the evidence is more probative than prejudicial.... If the defendant satisfies these three conditions, the trial court will authorize cross-examination of the complaining witness concerning the alleged false accusations.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AS4\"><em>Mazurek, </em>277 Mont. at 358, 922 P.2d at 480 (quoting <em>Miller v. State, </em>779 P.2d 87, 90 (Nev. 1989)).</p>\n<p id=\"b141-6\">\u00b619  Ring argues that the District Court refused his request to question S.H. about the existence and veracity of previous allegations based on an incorrect reading of <em>Anderson. </em>As the State points out, however, neither <em>Anderson </em>nor <em>Mazurek </em>suggested that a hearing can be used to examine the complaining witness on the stand if there is no evidence that the witness has made a prior false allegation. <em>Anderson </em>does not require the court to allow a party to question the victim on the day of trial in order to locate potential evidence of past accusations. The District Court did not abuse its discretion when it denied Ring\u2019s request to question S.H. on the day of trial in order to locate potential evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-7\">\u00b620  The District Court correctly interpreted <em>Anderson </em>when it denied Ring\u2019s request to question S.H. after determining that, to the extent evidence of previous accusations existed, it was inadmissible. Ring\u2019s pretrial motion for discovery related to S.H.\u2019s past allegations yielded a single report. The court examined the report and determined that charges had not been pressed and the report did not show whether the accusations were true or false. Pursuant to our decision in <em>Mazurek, </em>it was Ring\u2019s burden to establish that the accusations were false. Ring did not do so. The District Cotut correctly interpreted our derision in <em>Anderson, </em>and did not abuse its discretion, when it denied Ring\u2019s request to question S.H., having determined the report <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>regarding S.H.\u2019s previous accusation did not show the accusation was false and, therefore, was inadmissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-4\">\u00b621 <em>2. Did a jury instruction stating that intoxication is not a defense violate Ring\u2019s right to due process, when he testified that he had taken prescription medication?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b142-5\">\u00b622 Section 45-5-507(1), MCA, provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b142-6\">Incest. (1) A person commits the offense of incest if the person knowingly marries, cohabits with, has sexual intercourse with, or has sexual contact, as defined in 45-2-101, with an ancestor, a descendant, a brother or sister of the whole or half blood, or any stepson or stepdaughter.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b142-7\">Critically, the statute requires that, to be guilty of incest, an individual must have acted \u201cknowingly.\u201d Section 45-2-101(35), MCA, provides that \u201ca person acts knowingly with respect to conduct or to a circumstance described by a statute defining an offense when the person is aware of the person\u2019s own conduct or that the circumstance exists.\u201d Section 45-2-203, MCA, provides that, in most cases, intoxication may not be taken into account in determining the existence of a mental state that is an element of an offense:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b142-8\">Responsibility-mtoxicated condition. A person who is in an intoxicated condition is criminally responsible for the person\u2019s conduct, and an intoxicated condition is not a defense to any offense and may not be taken into consideration in determining the existence of a mental state that is an element of the offense unless the defendant proves that the defendant did not know that it was an intoxicating substance when the defendant consumed, smoked, sniffed, injected, or otherwise ingested the substance causing the condition.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b142-9\">In <em>Montana v. Egelhoff, </em>518 U.S. 37, 55, 116 S. Ct. 2013, 2023 (1996), the United States Supreme Court held that \u00a7 45-2-203, MCA, reduced the State\u2019s burden of proving an offense, but did not violate a criminal defendant\u2019s right to due process by eliminating the requirement that the State prove each element of an offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-10\">\u00b623 Ring argues that the jury was precluded from frilly taking into consideration Ring\u2019s mental state by the jury instruction pertaining to being in an \u201cintoxicated condition\u201d due to consumption or ingestion of an \u201cintoxicating substance.\u201d The jury instruction read as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b142-11\">A defendant who is in an intoxicated condition is criminally responsible for his conduct and an intoxicated condition is not a defense to any offense and may not be taken into consideration in determining the existence of a mental state which is an element of the offense unless the defendant proves that he did not know <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>that it was an intoxicating substance when he consumed or otherwise ingested the substance causing the condition. An intoxicating substance includes a controlled substance such as morphine and hydrocodone.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b143-4\">Ring argues that his case is distinguishable from cases involving voluntary intoxication, like <em>Egelhoff, </em>because he was \u201cfollowing physician orders\u201d when he ingested medication that made him drowsy. He asserts that \u00a7 45-2-203, MCA, as applied to him, is unconstitutional because it violates his state and federal constitutional rights of due process and his state constitutional right to defend himself against criminal charges. The statute also, he alleges, unconstitutionally eliminates the State\u2019s burden of proof to establish that Ring knowingly committed incest.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-5\">\u00b624  Ring\u2019s argument suffers from the fatal flaw that he was not following physician orders when he ingested four hydrocodone pills, combined with Naproxen, cold medicines and possibly the lingering effects of morphine. He was prescribed one hydrocodone pill per day for pain, as well as two Naproxen, twice a day. He had taken four times the dosage of hydrocodone prescribed to him, in combination with several other medications. This case is no different from any other case in which a criminal defendant chooses to become intoxicated, commits a crime and is held accountable for his conduct, pursuant to \u00a7 45-2-203, MCA. <em>See e.g. Egelhoff, </em>518 U.S. at 56, 116 S. Ct. at 2023-24; <em>State v. McCaslin, </em>2004 MT 212, 322 Mont. 350, 96 P.3d 722 (jury instruction based on \u00a7 45-2-203, MCA, did not shift the burden of proving the mental state element to the defendant and did not violate the defendant\u2019s right to due process under the Montana Constitution); <em>State v. Smith, </em>2005 MT 325, 329 Mont. 526, 127 P.3d 353 (district court did not abuse its discretion in denying defendant\u2019s request for a jury instruction allowing consideration of defendant\u2019s intoxication in determining whether he acted with the requisite intent); <em>State v. Belanus, </em>2010 MT 204, 357 Mont. 463, 240 P.3d 1021 (Section 45-2-203, MCA, did not violate defendant\u2019s fundamental right to defend, pursuant to the Montana Constitution, where defendant presented evidence of his intoxication and no jury instruction based on the statute was given); <em>Myran, </em>\u00b6 28 (jury instruction mirroring the language of \u00a7 45-2-203, MCA, did not violate defendant\u2019s right to due process or to present a defense, where defendant fully presented his defense, including evidence of intoxication, at trial).</p>\n<p id=\"b143-6\">\u00b625  Nor does applying the statute through a jury instruction of this type violate Ring\u2019s rights to due process or to defend himself against criminal charges. Section 45-2-203, MCA, does not eliminate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>the State\u2019s burden of proving each element of the charged offense beyond a reasonable doubt, it simply reduces the burden by making it easier to bear. The United States Supreme Court explained in <em>Egelhoff, </em>518 U.S. at 55, 116 S. Ct. at 2023:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b144-4\">[Rleducing\u2019 the State\u2019s burden ... [by excluding evidence of intoxication that might refute <em>mens rea] </em>is not unconstitutional, unless the rule of evidence itself violates a fundamental principle of fairness (which, as discussed, this one [(\u00a7 45-2-203, MCA)] does not). We have rejected the view that anything in the Due Process Clause bars States from making changes in their criminal law that have the effect of making it easier for the prosecution to obtain convictions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b144-5\">(Citation and quotation omitted). The Supreme Court concluded that the Due Process Clause does not prohibit Montana from \u201cdisallowing consideration of voluntary intoxication when a defendant\u2019s state of mind is at issue.\u201d <em>Egelhoff, </em>518 U.S. at 56, 116 S. Ct. at 2024. This Court has adhered to the principle set forth in <em>Egelhoff </em>and has rejected challenges to jury instructions based on \u00a7 45-2-203, MCA, on State constitutional grounds. <em>See McCaslin </em>(rejecting challenge to \u00a7 45-2-203, MCA, under Montana\u2019s Due Process clause, Article II, Section 17, of the Montana Constitution); <em>Myran </em>(rejecting challenge to \u00a7 45-2-203, MCA, based on contention that Montana\u2019s Constitution provides a greater right to assert a defense than its federal counterpart). We conclude that Ring\u2019s case is controlled by <em>Egelhoff and </em>its progeny. The jury instructions in this case fully and fairly instructed the jury as to the applicable law, and no reversible error has been committed.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-6\">\u00b626 <em>3. Did the District Court abuse its discretion when it denied Ring\u2019s motion for a new trial based on an allegation of juror bias?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b144-7\">\u00b627 It is within a district court\u2019s discretion to grant a defendant a new trial \u201cif required in the interest of justice.\u201d Section 46-16-702(1), MCA. We have consistently held that where juror nondisclosure does not amount to an intentional concealment, and no further evidence of bias is proven, there are no grounds for a new trial. <em>Dunfee, \u00b6 </em>16; <em>State v. Woods, </em>221 Mont. 17, 21, 716 P.2d 624, 627 (1986). In <em>Woods, </em>a burglary case, a juror was never asked whether he had been a victim of burglary and did not disclose that he had been burglarized three times. <em>Woods, </em>221 Mont. at 21, 716 P.2d at 626-27. We held that the nondisclosure was \u201cinadvertent and unintentional\u201d and found no grounds for reversal. <em>Woods, </em>221 Mont. at 21, 716 P.2d at 627.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-8\">\u00b628 Similarly, in <em>Dunfee, </em>a juror answered every question asked of him in voir dire truthfully, but did not reveal that he had been assaulted by the defendant\u2019s brother. <em>Dunfee, </em>\u00b6 17. At a hearing on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial based on juror misconduct, the juror testified under oath that he had no ill will towards the defendant and that he was a fair and impartial juror. <em>Dunfee, </em>\u00b6 17. This Court remarked that \u201c[o]ther than his speculation, Dunfee has presented no evidence that the juror held any ill will toward him.\u201d <em>Dunfee, </em>\u00b6 17. We held that the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying the defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial. <em>Dunfee, </em>\u00b6 18.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-4\">\u00b629 The District Court, after holding a hearing on Ring\u2019s motion for a new trial and requesting supplemental briefing from the parties, cited <em>Woods </em>and <em>Dunfee </em>in concluding that Ring had not established he was entitled to a new trial. The court noted that, as in <em>Woods, </em>the juror in question was never asked whether she was an incest victim in voir dire, so her failure to disclose that fact could not amount to intentional concealment. In addition, the court reasoned, there was no evidence the juror had exhibited any bias or ill will towards Ring.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-5\">\u00b630 On appeal, Ring does not challenge the District Court\u2019s determination that the juror\u2019s failure to disclose her experience of incest did not amount to intentional concealment. Instead, Ring distinguishes <em>Woods </em>on the basis that being a victim of a past sex crime produces inherent bias. He argues that the juror lacked the capacity to determine whether she could consider the case without bias.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-6\">\u00b631  We find the District Court\u2019s disposition of Ring\u2019s motion for a new trial well-reasoned and decline Ring\u2019s invitation to redefine our test for juror bias in the context of a sex crime trial. As in <em>Dunfee, </em>Ring has shown no evidence beyond his own speculation that the juror here held any bias or ill will towards him. As the District Court pointed out, she \u201cuniformly stated that she was unbiased and initially questioned whether Ring was guilty.\u201d Having been a victim of a sex crime does not produce inherent bias any more than having been a victim of a burglary or a physical assault does; the District Court correctly relied upon our decision in <em>Woods. </em>The District Court did not abuse its discretion in denying Ring\u2019s motion for a new trial on grounds of juror misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-7\">\u00b632 <em>4. Did the District Court err when it imposed conditions of the sentence that imposed restitution in an unspecified amount and ordered Ring to pay for the cost of his incarceration?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b145-8\">\u00b633 Ring alleges that several portions of his sentence are illegal and should be stricken from the judgment. In <em>State v. Heafner, </em>2010 MT 87, \u00b6 11, 356 Mont. 128, 231 P.3d 1087, we held that when a portion of a sentence is illegal, the proper practice is to remand to the district court to correct the illegal conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>a. Parole conditions</p>\n<p id=\"b146-4\">\u00b634 District courts have only the power to impose those parole conditions which are specifically and explicitly authorized by statute. <em>State v. Burch, </em>2008 MT 118, \u00b6 36, 342 Mont. 499, 182 P.3d 66. Apart from those conditions set forth in the statute, the authority to impose conditions on parole rests solely with the Board of Pardons and Parole (Board). <em>Heafher, </em>\u00b6 5. The Board may consider any conditions of parole imposed in excess of a district court\u2019s statutory authority as recommendations. <em>See Heafher, </em>\u00b6 6. We have held that where no part of a defendant\u2019s sentence is suspended, conditions set forth in the sentence may amount to conditions on parole. <em>See State v. Gunderson, </em>2010 MT 166, \u00b6\u00b6 109-10, 357 Mont. 142, 237 P.3d 74.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-5\">\u00b635 Ring argues that Conditions 2-14,17-19,21(A)-(L), (O) amount to conditions on parole and are not authorized by statute. The State agrees. Because no portion of Ring\u2019s sentence is suspended, the conditions Ring challenges amount to conditions of parole and are illegal under these circumstances. <em>See Gunderson, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 109-10. Consistent with our decision in <em>Heafher, </em>\u00b6 11, we therefore remand to the District Court to strike these conditions of parole. The District Court, in its discretion, may reinstate these \u201cconditions\u201d as recommendations to the Board. <em>See Heafher, </em>\u00b6 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-6\">b. Restitution</p>\n<p id=\"b146-7\">\u00b636 Section 46-18-244, MCA, requires the sentencing court to \u201cspecify the total amount of restitution that the offender shall pay.\u201d We have held that this means a district court may only order a defendant to pay a set amount of restitution, based on the evidence provided by the State. <em>Heafher, </em>\u00b6 7. Where the court has not specified the amount of restitution to be paid, remand for further proceedings to determine an appropriate amount of restitution is an appropriate remedy. <em>See Heafher, </em>\u00b6 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-8\">\u00b637  The District Court\u2019s judgment, in Condition 16, required Ring to pay \u201call future medical expenses that his victim can reasonably be expected to incur as a result of the defendant\u2019s criminal conduct, including the cost of psychological counseling, therapy, and treatment, in an amount to be determined by the Court\u2019s restitution officer[.]\u201d This order of restitution does not meet the statutory requirement for specificity, as clarified in <em>Heafher. </em>Accordingly, we remand so the District Court may strike this condition and, in its discretion, conduct such proceedings as it deems necessary to order restitution in a specified amount.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-9\">c. Future costs of incarceration</p>\n<p id=\"b146-10\">\u00b638 The State concedes that Condition 20, requiring Ring to pay \u201call <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>future costs of incarceration and medical costs while incarcerated, pursuant to Section 7-32-2245\u201d should be stricken on remand. As the State concedes, \u00a7 7-32-2245, MCA, applies only to costs of confinement in a \u201cdetention center\u201d and cannot be applied to Ring\u2019s incarceration in the Montana State Prison. <em>See </em>\u00a7 7-32-2201, MCA (describing and defining \u201cdetention center\u201d). Accordingly, we remand to the District Court to strike this condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b147-6\">\u00b639 We affirm the District Court\u2019s determinations with regards to S.H.\u2019s alleged past accusations; the jury instruction pertaining to the effect of Ring\u2019s intoxication; and Ring\u2019s motion for a new trial. We reverse and remand the sentence to the District Court for further proceedings to (1) either strike Conditions 2-14,17-19,21(A)-(L), (O), or restate those conditions as recommendations to the Board; (2) either strike Condition 16 pertaining to restitution, or set restitution in a specified amount; and (3) strike Condition 20, pertaining to Ring\u2019s costs of incarceration.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-7\">\u00b640 Affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded for further proceedings consistent with this Opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b147-8\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES BAKER, McKINNON and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
