The appeals arise out of a November7,2007 automobile accident and ensuing insurance coverage disputes.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-6\">\u00b62 At the time of the accident, Valerie Scheafer was driving a business vehicle owned by Mattress King, Inc. and insured by Mountain West Farm Bureau. Scheafer alleges that as a result of the accident, she incurred medical expenses and other losses. Scheafer, whose personal vehicles were insured by Safeco at the time, filed a claim with Safeco for medical payment benefits (Med Pay). Safeco paid Scheafer Med Pay benefits and Mountain West paid to her an undisclosed amount of underinsured motorist (UIM) benefits.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In November 2009, Scheafer, believing Safeco wrongfully refused to pay additional claimed benefits, brought a class action suit against her insurer in the Eighteenth Judicial District Court. Safeco moved to dismiss the complaint, and in June 2011 the District Court granted the motion. Scheafer appealed to this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-7\">\u00b63 In March 2012, we remanded the matter to the District Court with specific instructions pertaining to supplementation of the record and additional analysis by the District Court. The District Court issued its order following remand in August 2013, ruling in favor of Safeco. Scheafer appeals this order. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-8\">ISSUE</p>\n<p id=\"b305-9\">\u00b64 A restatement of the issue on appeal is whether the \u201cother insurance\u201d clauses in Scheafer\u2019s automobile liability policy are valid, and whether they violate the \u201cmade whole\u201d doctrine as <em>de facto </em>subrogation.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-10\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b305-11\">\n<em>First Appeal:</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b305-12\">\u00b65 Scheafer was injured in an automobile accident on November 7, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>2007. At the time of the accident, Scheafer, whose three personal vehicles were insured by Safeco, was driving a vehicle insured by Mountain West Farm Bureau. In August 2008, Scheafer submitted a notice of the accident to Safeco in which she specifically requested Med Pay benefits. She claimed that her then-current medical expenses exceeded $22,600. While Scheafer\u2019s Safeco policy provided both Med Pay and UIM coverage and Scheafer paid separate premiums for each, Scheafer\u2019s notice letter made no request for UIM benefits nor did it state any monetary damages related to UIM.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-4\">\u00b66 Scheafer later claimed that Safeco refused to pay Med Pay or UIM benefits. Safeco countered that it had paid her $1,000 which was the limit of her Med Pay coverage. Safeco acknowledged that after learning she was not driving one of her Safeco-insured vehicles, it advised her that it would not pay any UIM claim until the limits of Mountain West\u2019s UIM coverage were exhausted. Safeco explained to Scheafer that her policy contained \u201cother insurance\u201d clauses which provided that Safeco\u2019s Med Pay and UIM coverage were \u201cexcess\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> to any other similar coverage available under other applicable insurance policies \u2014 in this case, that of Mountain West.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-5\">\u00b67 On November 23,2009, Scheafer filed suit against Safeco on her own behalf and on behalf of other similarly situated Safeco insureds. In her class action complaint, Scheafer claimed she had \u201cincurred reasonable and necessary medical expenses and other damages and losses, which were causally related to the accident.\u201d The complaint did not reference the amount of medical expenses Scheafer had incurred nor did it identify the type or amount of \u201cother damages and losses\u201d for which she was seeking benefits. Additionally, the complaint did not indicate whether Mountain West, or any other insurer, had paid benefits to Scheafer and, if so, the amount and nature of such benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"AAb\">\u00b68 In Scheafer\u2019s complaint, she alleged that by requiring other Med Pay and UIM coverage to be exhausted before triggering Safeco\u2019s duty to pay benefits, Safeco engaged in unlawful subrogation that effectively reduced the amount of coverage available to her and all <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>Safeco insureds under their applicable policies. In her complaint, she asserted that Safeco: (1) breached its contract; (2) violated the Unfair Trade Practices Act, \u00a7\u00a7 33-18-101-1006, MCA; (3) committed constructive fraud; and (4) breached the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. Among other things, she sought the certification of her putative class and a declaration that the \u201cother insurance\u201d clauses in Safeco\u2019s policies violated public policy and were void and/or unconstitutional because they constituted subrogation. She also sought punitive damages. Scheafer further asserted that the \u201cother insurance\u201d clauses violated her right to be made whole.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-4\">\u00b69 In December 2009, Safeco moved to have Scheafer\u2019s action dismissed under M. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) (Rule 12(b)(6)) for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted. Safeco argued that the \u201cother insurance\u201d clauses were valid, enforceable, and did not constitute subrogation, and that Scheafer misinterpreted well-established Montana law. It asserted that Scheafer would not be entitled to the relief she seeks under any set of facts she could prove.</p>\n<p id=\"AAr\">\u00b610 In its June 2011 order, the District Court noted that the \u201cother insurance\u201d clauses in Safeco\u2019s policy constituted \u201cexcess\u201d clauses and are generally considered valid and enforceable. It acknowledged, however, that we have not previously discussed the enforceability of an excess clause in the context of both Med Pay and UIM coverage. After citing numerous cases in which we ruled excess insurance clauses were enforceable, the District Court concluded that the clauses in this case were valid and enforceable.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-5\">\u00b611 The court next addressed whether the \u201cother insurance\u201d clauses constituted subrogation. It determined that they did not amount to subrogation because the \u201cexcess\u201d clause did not reduce the amount of coverage available to Safeco\u2019s insureds; rather, the clause merely established a priority system by requiring that any other applicable policy be exhausted before Safeco\u2019s coverage was triggered. Thus, if Scheafer\u2019s damages exceed the amount of coverage available under the primary policy issued by Mountain West and she has not been made whole, then Safeco\u2019s benefits, up to the policy limits, are available to her. Having determined that the excess coverage clauses in Safeco\u2019s policy were valid, enforceable, did not amount to subrogation, and did not violate Scheafer\u2019s right to be made whole, the District Court granted Safeco\u2019s Rule 12(b)(6) motion. Scheafer appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-6\">\u00b612 We determined on appeal that the District Court record was insufficient to support its ruling in that the record did not contain either insurance policy at issue in the case. Furthermore, we observed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>there was nothing in the record to resolve the dispute as to whether Safeco had paid her Med Pay claim. Noting that we have historically treated Med Pay coverage differently from UIM coverage,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> we remanded the matter to the District Court for supplementation of the record and additional analysis concerning the distinction between Med Pay and UIM coverages in the context of \u201cother insurance\u201d clauses. We also instructed the District Court to determine the priority of the \u201cother insurance\u201d clauses contained in the two policies.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-4\">\n<em>Second Appeal:</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b308-5\">\u00b613 Following additional proceedings, the District Court issued its supplemental order on August 1,2013, and the matter has returned to us on appeal, once again by Scheafer. The record has been supplemented with a copy of each insurance policy and the parties have stipulated that on August 27,2008, Safeco paid Scheafer the total $1,000 Med Pay benefits to which she was entitled under her policies. Additionally, the District Court conducted the requested analysis pertaining to Med Pay and UIM coverage. The court again concluded the \u201cother insurance\u201d clauses contained in Safeco\u2019s policy were valid, enforceable, and did not constitute unlawful subrogation. The court further held that under the facts of the case, Mountain West\u2019s coverage was primary and Safeco\u2019s coverage was excess. Scheafer appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-6\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b308-7\">\u00b614 We review a district court\u2019s ruling on a motion to dismiss under the standards set forth in Rule 12(b)(6). A complaint should not be dismissed for failure to state a claim unless it appears beyond doubt that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts which would entitle him to relief. When considering a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6), all well-pled allegations and facts in the complaint are admitted and taken as true, and the complaint is construed in a light most favorable to the plaintiff. A district court\u2019s determination that a complaint has failed to state a claim for which relief can be granted is a conclusion of law which we review for correctness. <em>Sinclair v. Burlington Northern &amp; Santa Fe Ry., </em>2008 MT 424, \u00b6 25, 347 Mont. 395, 200 P.3d 46 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b308-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b308-9\">\u00b615 <em>The issue on appeal is whether the \u201cother insurance\u201d clauses in </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number><em>Scheafer\u2019s automobile liability policy are valid, and whether they violate the \u201cmade whole\u201d doctrine as </em>de facto <em>subrogation.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b309-4\">\u00b616 Scheafer\u2019s claim on appeal is that the \u201cother insurance\u201d clauses contained in Safeco\u2019s policy violate Montana\u2019s subrogation law and are therefore void and unenforceable. Scheafer asserts her right to be made whole is critical to this analysis. She cites numerous cases that stand for an injured insured\u2019s right to be made whole before an insurer may seek subrogation. <em>Skauge v. Mountain States Tel. &amp; Tel. Co., </em>172 Mont. 521, 528, 565 P.2d 628, 632 (1977); <em>Zacher v. American Ins. Co., </em>243 Mont. 226, 794 P.2d 335 (1990); <em>Youngblood v. American States Ins. Co., </em>262 Mont. 391, 866 P.2d 203 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b309-5\">\u00b617 Subrogation is \u201c[t]he principle under which an insurer that has paid a loss under an insurance policy is entitled to all the rights and remedies belonging to the insured against a third party with respect to any loss covered by the policy.\u201d <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>at 1440. As explained in <em>Skauge, </em>172 Mont. at 524, 565 P.2d at 630, \u201cSubrogation is a device of equity which is designed to compel the ultimate payment of a debt by the one who in justice, equity and good conscience should pay it.\u201d Additionally, we have held that it is \u201cthe public policy in Montana that an insured must be totally reimbursed for all losses as well as costs, including attorney fees, involved in recovering those losses before the insurer can exercise any right of subrogation, regardless of any contract language providing to the contrary.\u201d <em>Swanson v. Hartford Inc. Co., </em>2002 MT 81, \u00b6 28, 309 Mont. 269, 46 P.3d 584.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-6\">\u00b618 Scheafer\u2019s Safeco policy contained three \u201cother insurance\u201d clauses but the two clauses relevant to this case are contained in Scheafer\u2019s Med Pay and UIM coverage. The clause pertaining to Med Pay states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AMF\">If there is other applicable auto medical payments insurance available any insurance we provide shall be excess over any other applicable auto medical payments insurance. If more than one policy applies on an excess basis, we will bear our proportionate share with other collectible auto medical payments insurance.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ah0\">Additionally, the Safeco policy \u201cincludes medical payments coverage with limits of $1,000 per person.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b309-7\">\u00b619 The clause pertaining to UIM provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b309-8\">If there is other applicable insurance similar to the insurance provided under this Part of this policy, we will pay only our share of the loss. Our share is the proportion that our limit of liability bears to the total of all applicable limits. However, any insurance we provide with respect to a vehicle:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b310-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>1. You do not own, including any vehicle while used as temporary substitute for your covered auto; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b310-4\">2. Owned by you or any family member which is not insured for this coverage under this policy;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b310-5\">Shall be excess over any other collectible insurance similar to the insurance provided under this Part of the policy. [Emphasis in original.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b310-6\">The policy carried a $25,000 per person limit on underinsured bodily injury coverage regardless of the number of vehicles on the policy. Notably, this is not a \u201cstacking\u201d case in that Safeco\u2019s policy expressly provides that for each Med Pay and UIM coverage, Safeco charges \u201cone premium... regardless of the number of vehicles\u201d listed on an insured\u2019s policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-7\">\u00b620 The Mountain West policy also included an \u201cother insurance\u201d provision which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b310-8\">a. For any covered \u201cauto\u201d you own, this Coverage Form provides primary insurance. For any covered \u201cauto\u201d you don\u2019t own, the insurance provided by this Coverage Form is excess over any other collectible insurance....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b310-9\">The Mountain West policy contained a Med Pay limit of $5,000/person and a UIM limit of $50,000/person/$100,000/accident.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Because at the time of the accident Scheafer was driving a vehicle owned by Mattress King, Inc. and insured by Mountain West, Safeco argued that the Mountain West policy was primary, and its policy was excess. Moreover, Safeco asserted in its post-remand briefing to the District Court that it was its \u201cunderstanding that Mountain West Farm Bureau has acted as primary insurer ... and paid Scheafer\u2019s medical expenses accordingly....\u201d This again highlights a void in the record in this case \u2014 Scheafer has failed to disclose the amount, nature, and source of insurance proceeds she has received in conjunction with this accident, whether from the tortfeasor\u2019s insurer or from Mountain West. Without this information, we are unable to evaluate whether she has in actuality been made whole, or whether she has been denied any benefits to which she was entitled under either policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-10\">\u00b621 Scheafer asserts that \u201cother insurance\u201d clauses govern the relationship between insurers, but do not affect the right of the insured to recover under each concurrent policy. She claims that these clauses <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>adversely affected her right to recover under both policies, and they therefore constituted unlawful subrogation. She further argues that she must be made whole before Safeco can deny coverage based upon its claimed status as an \u201cexcess\u201d carrier. She maintains that the District Court erroneously determined that the clauses did not constitute subrogation and that Mountain West\u2019s policy provided primary coverage with her Safeco policy providing excess.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-4\">\u00b622 Arguing Montana\u2019s subrogation law and public policy are at the center of this dispute, Scheafer focuses much of her brief on the \u201cmade whole\u201d doctrine, assertingthe requirement inMontana that aninjured parly must be made whole before an insurer may assert its right of subrogation. She claims that Montana\u2019s made whole doctrine will be rendered meaningless if we determine that these \u201cother insurance\u201d clauses are not subrogation clauses. She submits that \u201cMontana law provides that there are no \u2018other insurance\u2019 priority of payment rights among concurrent insurance policies, when the claim implicates the Montana public policy set forth in <em>[Reitler], </em>and/or an insured\u2019s made whole rights.\u201d Scheafer maintains that Safeco\u2019s \u201cother insurance\u201d clauses operate to reduce the total amount of benefits available to its insureds and therefore constitute <em>de facto </em>subrogation clauses.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-5\">\u00b623 Scheafer argues that <em>Blue Cross &amp; Blue Shield of Mont., Inc. v. Mont. State Auditor, </em>2009 MT 318, 352 Mont. 423, 218 P.3d 475, among other cases, supports her argument that Safeco\u2019s \u201cother insurance\u201d clauses constitute subrogation. In <em>Blue Cross &amp; Blue Shield, </em>BCBS asked the insurance commissioner to approve insurance forms that contained exclusion language stating that BCBS \u201cwould not pay for health care costs of its injured beneficiaries if the beneficiaries received, or were entitled to receive, benefits from any automobile or premises liability policy.\u201d <em>Blue Cross &amp; Blue Shield, </em>\u00b6 5. After initially accepting the exclusion language, the commissioner subsequently disapproved the exclusion clauses and the district court affirmed the commissioner\u2019s ruling. After an administrative and a district court hearing, we determined the exclusion clauses:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b311-6\">effectively allow [BCBS] to exercise subrogation before paying anything to its insured, contrary to \u00a7 33-30-1101, MCA, which allows reimbursement \u201cfor benefits paid.\u201d The exclusions allow BCBS to avoid any payment of benefits to its insured if the insured is \u201centitled to receive\u201d benefits from any other auto or premises liability policy, whether or not the insured actually receives any of those benefits, and whether or not the insured has been made whole. Only when the insured is made whole as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>defined in Montana law, and then only after BCBS has paid out benefits to its insured, could BCBS be entitled to claim subrogation. It is contrary to Montana law for BCBS to eiyoy the benefits of subrogation in the circumstances allowed by the disputed exclusions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b312-4\"><em>Blue Cross &amp; Blue Shield, </em>\u00b6 19.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-5\">\u00b624 Safeco counters that <em>Blue Cross &amp; Blue Shield </em>is readily distinguishable from the case before us, in that the language of the BCBS policy allowed the insurer to avoid payment altogether in the event the insured received, or was \u201centitled to receive\u201d benefits from any other automobile policy. By contrast, Safeco would be obligated to pay benefits to its insured in the event the benefits available under the primaiy insurance policy were insufficient to cover the damages claimed by the insured. It maintains it has a contractual right to invoke the \u201cother insurance\u201d clauses in its policy to determine the priority of payment when more than one policy provides coverage for the same loss. Citing several cases, it asserts that \u201c[t]his Court has consistently upheld these types of clauses in the context of UIM, liability, and property damage/collision coverage, acknowledging that these clauses serve the valuable purpose of preventing an insured from recovering multiple times for the same loss.\u201d <em>See e.g. Bill Atkin Volkswagen v. McClafferty, </em>213 Mont. 99, 689 P.2d 1237 (1984); <em>P.C. Rental, Inc. v. Chase Manhattan Bank, </em>2000 MT 106, 299 Mont. 315, 998 P.2d 1168.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-6\">\u00b625 Acknowledging that this Court has historically treated Med Pay subrogation differently from UIM subrogation,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Safeco maintains that the distinction drawn in those cases is inapplicable here because this is not a subrogation case. Safeco further asserts that because Mountain West was the insurer of the involved vehicle, Mountain West was responsible for primary payment of damages and losses. Consequently, under the plain language of its policy, Safeco was the excess or secondary insurer, and would be available to pay benefits only after Mountain West had paid frill benefits under the component coverages of its policy. Safeco thus insists that this is not a subrogation/made whole case. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-7\">\u00b626 In <em>Blue Cross &amp; Blue Shield, </em>as detailed above, BCBS was seeking to avoid making payments if the insured was covered by any other insurance policy covering the same type of damages or injuries. Had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>the other insurer failed to pay benefits, BCBS could still have denied benefits under its exclusion clause. In the case before us, Safeco is not trying to eliminate its obligation to Scheafer, it is merely requiring that the involved vehicle\u2019s insurer first pay what it is obligated to pay, and Safeco will pay the excess, if any, within its policy limits. Because the language and effect of the BCBS and Safeco policies is significantly different, reliance on <em>Blue Cross &amp; Blue Shield </em>by Scheafer is misplaced.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-4\">\u00b627 Scheafer\u2019s reliance on <em>Reitler </em>and <em>Christenson </em>for the proposition that unlawful subrogation is occurring here is similarly misplaced. In <em>Reitler, </em>Allstate made payments under its medical payments coverage to its insured Welton following an accident that was not her fault. It then sought to subrogate to the extent of those medical payments against the liability insurer for the tortfeasor Reitler. We held that because the insured had paid a premium for the medical payments coverage and that she would be likely to suffer if the medical payments she received must then be repaid out of her third-party recovery, the medical payment subrogation clauses at issue were invalid. We further observed that the tortfeasor\u2019s carrier could conceivably conclude that because the injured person has already been paid medical expenses, it could make a smaller offer than it would otherwise be required to make. <em>Reitler, </em>192 Mont. at 356, 628 P.2d at 670. Subsequently, in <em>Christenson, </em>we held that our holding in <em>Reitler </em>declaring a subrogation clause invalid was limited to the medical payment coverage situation. <em>Christenson, </em>211 Mont. at 255, 683 P.2d at 1322.</p>\n<p id=\"AIu\">\u00b628  We agree with Safeco that <em>Reitler </em>and <em>Christenson </em>have no application here. In <em>Reitler, </em>Allstate\u2019s attempted subrogation could have conceivably depleted the available liability policy limits carried by the tortfeasor, thus resulting in a reduced recovery by the injured party. Here, Safeco has attempted no subrogation, nor has it refused Scheafer\u2019s claim for either Med Pay coverage or UIM coverage. Rather, it paid Scheafer\u2019s Med Pay claim and assumed a backup position to the UIM benefits available under the Mountain West policy. In short, this is not a subrogation case. This being so, we need make no distinction between the Med Pay and UIM excess coverages.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-5\">\u00b629  Significantly, Scheafer does not argue that her damages and losses exceed the benefits that were available under the Mountain West policy, nor does she provide any evidence to establish that she has not been \u201cmade whole.\u201d In fact, she asserts that she \u201cis not alleging her losses exceed the limits\u201d of the UIM coverage in Mountain West\u2019s policy. This concession, when combined with the absence of any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>information about the amount of her UIM claim or the amount of benefits paid by Mountain West or any other insurer, leaves us to speculate as to the basis of her present claim. At a minimum, the concession draws into question her assertion that Safeco is somehow obligated to pay additional UIM benefits. While we are unable to make any informed determination of whether Scheafer\u2019s damages entitled her to additional benefits, we can say \u2014 premised on the facts before us \u2014 that the \u201cother insurance\u201d clauses in Scheafer\u2019s automobile policy are valid, and that, as applied here, do not constitute <em>de facto </em>subrogation.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-4\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b314-5\">\u00b630 For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the District Court\u2019s ruling granting Safeco\u2019s motion to dismiss Scheafer\u2019s claim.</p>\n<judges id=\"b314-6\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES McMNNON, WHEAT and RICE concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b305-13\"> There is virtually no information in the record before us about the accident.
