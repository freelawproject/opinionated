The dispositive issue on appeal is whether the District Court erred when it determined that Moats did not establish, by clear and convincing evidence, a child-parent relationship with her grandchildren.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-9\">\u00b62 We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-10\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b58-11\">\u00b63 Hansen and Brandi Moats (Brandi) began dating while in high school. They had a tumultuous relationship, and Hansen allegedly engaged in occasional violent and unpredictable behavior that resulted in a series of orders of protection against him. The District Court issued the first Permanent Order of Protection against Hansen on behalf of Moats and Brandi, effective through October 20,2005, after an incident in 2004 when Hansen allegedly struck Brandi and shoved Moats while he was intoxicated. Around the same time, Hansen\u2019s mother obtained a Permanent Order of Protection against Moats \u201cto prevent [Moats] from interfering with [her] raising of [Hansen] ...\u201d Hansen\u2019s mother alleged that Moats \u201cwould buy [Hansen and Brandi] alcohol, she would get [Hansen] out of school, she would call into the school and say he was at home, that she was his mother. It got to the point it was absolutely ridiculous.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b58-12\">\u00b64 S. J.H. was bom after Brandi graduated from high school in the spring of 2006. Hansen and Brandi married in 2007, and Hansen joined the Army shortly afterward. The couple lived together at Fort Drum, New York, then at Fort Lewis, Washington.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>\u00b65 Hansen and Brandi separated over the Thanksgiving holiday in 2009, while Brandi was pregnant with their second child. Hansen allegedly became angry, pulled a gun, and threatened Brandi. She obtained a second Order of Protection against Hansen after this incident. J.B.H. was bom a few months later. Brandi filed for divorce in February 2010. Following a half-day trial at which both parties appeared and gave sworn testimony, the District Court entered Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law and a Final Decree on May 25, 2012. The Final Decree of Dissolution provided that the two children would reside permanently with Brandi. Because of Hansen\u2019s history of domestic violence, the court permitted him only supervised contact with his children pending completion of a court-services investigation. Hansen never completed the evaluation and exercised his supervised visitation right just a few times.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-5\">\u00b66 Brandi died on April 18,2013, in a fire at a home in which she did not reside; the children were not present. Immediately following Brandi\u2019s death, Moats took control of the children and refused Hansen\u2019s attempts to contact them. A few days later, on April 22,2013, Moats filed another petition for a Temporary Restraining Order against Hansen. The District Court granted the petition \u201cin part to attempt to calm a volatile situation, to avoid potential additional trauma to the children and permit Brandi\u2019s family opportunity to have a funeral without the chaos of a custody dispute.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b59-6\">\u00b67 Hansen filed a petition for exclusive parental control and Moats filed guardianship proceedings; the District Court consolidated both actions into Hansen and Brandi\u2019s dissolution action. By the time the matter went to trial, Moats had changed her request for guardianship to a request to be awarded a parental interest and for a parenting plan consistent with that interest. At trial, Hansen denied committing the violent actions alleged in the petitions to obtain any of the protective orders against him. The District Court entered an order granting Hansen sole custody of both children.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-7\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b59-8\">\u00b68 This Court reviews a district court\u2019s interpretation and application of statutes for correctness and findings of fact to determine whether the findings are clearly erroneous. <em>In re A.P.R., </em>2011 MT 50, \u00b6 7, 359 Mont. 386, 251 P.3d 127 (citing <em>Kulstad v. Maniaci, </em>2009 MT 326, \u00b6\u00b6 50-52, 352 Mont. 513, 220 P.3d 595). \u201cA finding is clearly erroneous if it is not supported by substantial credible evidence, if the trial court misapprehended the effect of the evidence, or if a review of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>the evidence leaves this Court with a definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been made.\u201d <em>Puccinelli v. Puccinelli, </em>2012 MT 46, \u00b6 13, 364 Mont. 235, 272 P.3d 117. \u201cWe confine our review to the determination of whether substantial credible evidence supports the findings actually made by the district court.\u201d <em>A.P.P., </em>\u00b6 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b60-6\">\u00b69 <em>Whether the District Court erred when it determined that Moats did not establish a child-parent relationship with her grandchildren.</em></p>\n<p id=\"AIs\">\u00b610  To award a parental interest to a person other than a natural parent, the person must show by clear and convincing evidence that \u201cthe natural parent has engaged in conduct that is contrary to the child-parent relationship[,] the nonparent has established with the child a child-parent relationship, as defined in 40-4-211, and it is in the best interests of the child to continue that relationship.\u201d Section 40-4-228(2), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-7\">\u00b611 A \u201cchild-parent relationship\u201d is defined as a relationship that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b60-8\">(a) exists or did exist, in whole or in part, preceding the filing of an action under this section, in which a person provides or provided for the physical needs of a child by supplying food, shelter, and clothing and provides or provided the child with necessary care, education, and discipline;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b60-9\">(b) continues or existed on a day-to-day basis through interaction, companionship, interplay, and mutuality that fiilfill the child\u2019s psychological needs for a parent as well as the child\u2019s physical needs; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b60-10\">(c) meets or met the child\u2019s need for continuity of care by providing permanency or stability in residence, schooling, and activities outside of the home.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b60-11\">Section 40-4-211(6), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-12\">\u00b612 We have considered the application of this statute on only a few occasions. Recently, we held that non-natural parents had asserted facts that could establish a \u201cchild-parent relationship\u201d where the couple cared for the child almost full-time for seven years and provided food, shelter, clothing, and a stable home. <em>In re M.M.G., </em>2012 MT 228, \u00b6 13, 366 Mont. 386, 287 P.3d 952. They also enrolled the child in school, helped her with homework, and attended her parent-teacher conferences and school plays. <em>M.M.G., </em>\u00b6 13. We affirmed in another case a district court\u2019s finding that a child-parent relationship existed where \u201cthe evidence established [that the non-natural parent] has been a primary caretaker of each of the three children since their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>births.\u201d <em>In re L.F.A., </em>2009 MT 363, \u00b6 17, 353 Mont. 220, 220 P.3d 391.</p>\n<p id=\"AMO\">\u00b613 In <em>Kulstad, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 80-85, we upheld a finding of a child-parent relationship where the non-natural parent jointly had served with the natural mother \u201cas parents for young children entirely dependent on them for their care and well being[,]\u201d living together in the same household, assuming significant financial obligations of parenthood, and serving in a parental role \u201cfor a sufficient length of time to have established with the children \u2018a bonded, dependent relationship parental in nature.\u2019 \u201d We upheld a finding that a step-father established a child-parent relationship based on similar evidence in <em>In re A.P.P., </em>\u00b6 20.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-5\">\u00b614  In defining a child-parent relationship, \u00a7 40-4-211(6), MCA, imposes a lengthy list of conjunctive factors that all must be proven by clear and convincing evidence. Despite Moats\u2019s efforts to establish that she \u201cwillingly accepted and performed the responsibilities and obligations of co-parenting with her daughter,\u201d however, the District Court determined that Moats\u2019s relationship with S. J.H. and J.B.H. was that of an involved grandmother, not a parent. The record supports this conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-6\">\u00b615 Unlike the facts that were found persuasive in <em>M.M.G. </em>or <em>L.F.A, </em>the District Court here determined that Moats\u2019s care was sporadic, and that her presence had been even a disruptive factor in the family\u2019s life. The court found that Hansen and Brandi\u2019s relationship was \u201cnegatively impacted by [Moats\u2019s] interference or involvement.\u201d She did not provide care to S. J.H. during the time he lived in New York or Washington. The court provided the following analysis of Moats\u2019s claim that she established a child-parent relationship:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b61-7\">[Moats\u2019s] assertion is not persuasive. Brandi qualified for a housing voucher which paid all but $47 of the rent. Brandi received HRDC assistance for child care. Brandi received food stamps for her and the children. [Moats\u2019s] Social Security disability income of approximately $800 per month is her sole source of income and was used primarily for her own support. Without Brandi and the public assistance support she received, [Moats] would have likely had a difficult time providing for herself. While [Moats] no doubt provided some babysitting and assistance to Brandi, it was as a caring grandmother[,] not [as] a parent.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b61-8\">\u00b616 The court ultimately found that, while \u201c[Moats] has a strong grandparent bond with [S. J.H. and J.B.H.], [she] has not established a parent-child relationship between her and [S.J.H.] or her and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>[J.B.H.].\u201d Although Moats submitted evidence to show that she attended the children\u2019s medical appointments, took them to school and day care, and stepped in when Hansen was not present, the testimony revealed significant conflicts that the District Court was in the best position to resolve. \u201cWe view the evidence in the light most favorable to the prevailing party\u201d and \u201cdo not consider whether evidence supports findings that are different from those made by the district court.\u201d As oft-repeated in matters of child custody, \u201cthe trial court determines the credibility of witnesses and the weight assigned to their respective testimony.\u201d <em>A.P.P., </em>\u00b6 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-4\">\u00b617 Because all elements of the statute must be met by clear and convincing evidence for a person other than a natural parent to be awarded a parental interest, we decline to address Moats\u2019s arguments under the other elements of \u00a7 40-4-228(2), MCA. In particular, without proof of a child-parent relationship, a court need not proceed to determine whether the natural parent engaged in conduct that is contrary to the child-parent relationship. This Court recognizes the District Court\u2019s findings in the dissolution action regarding Hansen\u2019s history of domestic violence. The District Court expressed its concern that \u201cthere is potential for James to model inappropriate behavior to his children.\u201d Section 40-4-212, MCA, explaining the \u201cbest interests of the child\u201d standard, provides, \u201c(1) The court shall determine the parenting plan in accordance with the best interest of the child. The court shall consider all relevant parenting factors, which may include but are not limited to:... (f) physical abuse or threat of physical abuse by one parent against the other parent or the child.\u201d This factor, and others listed in the statute, are for a court to consider when allocating arrangements between parents or persons who have a proven parent-child relationship. Without that relationship, another person may not ask the court to restrict a natural parent\u2019s rights in a civil parenting proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b62-6\">\u00b618  The District Court in this case, having observed the legal interactions between Hansen and Brandi since their first order of protection in 2005, was very familiar with the parties and the issues in this matter. Its decision is supported by substantial, credible evidence and we defer to its findings. Because Moats did not seek an award of visitation rights in the alternative to a parental interest, we do not consider the applicability of \u00a7 40-4-228(3), MCA, to this action. SeeA.P.P., \u00b6 21. The record does, however, support the District Court\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>observation of the strong bond between Moats and the children. We concur with its recommendation that Hansen work with Moats to maintain that relationship.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-5\">\u00b619 The District Court\u2019s July 22, 2013 order granting exclusive parental control and authority over S.J.H. and J.B.H. to Hansen is affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b63-6\">JUSTICES COTTER, McKINNON, WHEAT and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
