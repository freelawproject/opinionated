Nelson and Oltrogge were returning to Nelson\u2019s home near the intersection of Hallowell Avenue and Bruce Lane in Billings after visiting the McDonald\u2019s on Southgate Drive. They passed Nelson\u2019s 13-year-old neighbor, M.C., walking home from a nearby school. Oltrogge slowed the vehicle next to M.C. Oltrogge raised her middle finger and said, \u201cFuck you.\u201d Nelson said, \u201cSpic bastard.\u201d The women then drove away. M.C. continued his short walk home and told his mother what had happened. At 3:51 p.m., M.C.\u2019s mother called 911 to report the incident. Officer Brett Becker responded to the call. M.C. told Officer Becker he was scared by the incident. Officer Becker reported that both M.C. and his mother appeared upset and worried. Officer Becker went to Nelson\u2019s home to inquire about the incident. Nelson\u2019s husband, Kevin Nelson, opened the door and told Officer Becker, \u201cWe\u2019re not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>going to answer any questions.\u201d Officer Becker informed the city attorney that Nelson and Oltrogge did not want to talk to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-4\">\u00b610 Nelson and Oltrogge were charged with disorderly conduct. They consented to a combined trial and waived their rights to counsel and a jury trial. Nelson and Oltrogge represented themselves in a bench trial before Judge Pro Tempore Lance Lundvall, who also practices as a criminal defense attorney. Officer Becker testified during the prosecution\u2019s case in chief that he had not spoken with either Nelson or Oltrogge. On cross-examination, he explained his earlier report by saying, \u201cI wrote that they stated they wouldn\u2019t answer any questions, and I guess I should have just wrote that the person that answered the door said that they don\u2019t want to answer any questions.\u201d At the close of the prosecution\u2019s evidence, Nelson moved to dismiss the charges, arguing \u201cyou can\u2019t disturb the peace of one person.\u201d The Municipal Court took the motion under advisement.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-5\">\u00b611 Nelson and Oltrogge presented their defense. Nelson claimed she and Oltrogge had not seen M.C. that day, because they were at McDonald\u2019s on Southgate Drive, approximately two miles from the intersection of Hallowell Avenue and Bruce Lane, when the incident allegedly occurred. After testifying to its authenticity, Nelson offered as evidence a receipt from McDonald\u2019s, time-stamped 3:41 p.m.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Nelson claims the charges were fabricated because she kept the \u201cbark log\u201d in an ongoing neighborhood dispute over a barking dog belonging to M.C.\u2019s family.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-6\">\u00b612 After Nelson and Oltrogge concluded their presentation of evidence, they presented additional arguments on the motion to dismiss. Nelson claimed her speech was constitutionally protected and did not constitute \u201cfighting words,\u201d because she remained in the vehicle and therefore was not face-to-face with M.C. The City also presented additional legal authorities. The Municipal Court denied the motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-7\">\u00b613 The Municipal Court found Nelson and Oltrogge guilty of disorderly conduct and proceeded to sentencing. Nelson and Oltrogge were each ordered to pay a $100 fine and serve 10 days in jail. The jail time was suspended for a period of six months. The Municipal Court explained the sentence as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b473-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>I do have to say I might feel differently if all the parties here and all the folks involved were adults, but they\u2019re not. We\u2019ve got a 13-year-old boy who stood on this witness stand and was obviously very nervous ... . [I]f, as adults, we are directing that kind of language towards children, I don\u2019t know what kind of example and what we are showing to our children. That\u2019s problematic for me in this case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b473-4\">\u00b614 Nelson appealed to the District Court. She argued the Municipal Court erred when it denied the motion to dismiss, repeating her arguments that her speech was constitutionally protected and that one cannot be convicted of disorderly conduct for disturbing the peace of only one person. She also claimed her Sixth Amendment rights were violated when Officer Becker told the city attorney she had refused to speak with him, when in fact Officer Becker had only spoken to her husband. She argued the Municipal Corat improperly considered the victim\u2019s age. She also objected to the manner in which the Municipal Court allowed her to present evidence. In a 15-page Order, the District Court affirmed the Municipal Court conviction. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-5\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b473-6\">\u00b615 On appeal from a municipal court, the district court functions as an intermediate appellate court. <em>City of Bozeman v. Cantu, </em>2013 MT 40, \u00b6 10, 369 Mont. 81, 296 P.3d 461. When reviewing the decision of the district court in such an appeal, we review the case as if the appeal had originally been filed in this Court, applying the appropriate standard of review. <em>Cantu, </em>\u00b6 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-7\">\u00b616 The interpretation and construction of a statute is a question of law, which we review de novo. <em>State v. Brown, </em>2009 MT 452, \u00b6 6, 354 Mont. 329, 223 P.3d 874. The denial of a motion to dismiss is also reviewed de novo. <em>State v. LeMay, </em>2011 MT 323, \u00b6 27, 363 Mont. 172, 266 P.3d 1278. We exercise plenary review of constitutional issues. <em>State v. Dugan, </em>2013 MT 38, \u00b6 14, 369 Mont. 39, 303 P.3d 755. We review evidentiary rulings for abuse of discretion. <em>State v. Daniels, </em>2011 MT 278, \u00b6 11, 362 Mont. 426, 265 P.3d 623. We generally will not address issues raised for the first time on appeal. <em>Weaver v. State, </em>2013 MT 247, \u00b6 38, 371 Mont. 476, 310 P.3d 495.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b473-9\">\u00b617 <em>Issue One: Whether the disorderly conduct statute, \u00a7 45-8-101, MCA, requires proof that the peace of more than one person was disturbed.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b473-10\">\u00b618 The disorderly conduct statute provides, in relevant part: \u201cA <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>person commits the offense of disorderly conduct if the person knowingly disturbs the peace by ... using threatening, profane, or abusive language....\u201d Section 45-8-101(l)(c), MCA. The Criminal Law Commission Comments to this section state:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b474-4\">The intent of the provision is to use somewhat broad, general terms to establish a foundation for the offense and leave the application to the facts of a particular case. Two important qualifications are specified in making the application, however. First, the offender must knowingly make a disturbance of the enumerated kind, and second, the behavior must disturb \u201cothers.\u201d It is not sufficient that a single person or a very few persons have grounds for complaint.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b474-5\">Nelson relies on the Comments to argue she cannot be convicted of disturbing the peace, because she disturbed only M.C. She says M.C. produced no evidence that anyone else heard the remarks or witnessed the incident, and cites M.C.\u2019s testimony that Nelson and Oltrogge did not \u201choller\u201d their remarks.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-6\">\u00b619 We have previously noted that the Comments conflict with the plain language of the statute, which \u201cdoes not specify that conduct must disturb \u2018others,\u2019 or otherwise indicate that conduct affecting \u2018a single person or a very few persons\u2019 is insufficient to give rise to a violation of the statute.\u201d <em>State v. Ashmore, </em>2008 MT 14, \u00b6 13, 341 Mont. 131, 176 P.3d 1022. In <em>Ashmore, </em>the defendant moved to dismiss charges of disorderly conduct on the grounds that her conduct had disturbed only two police officers. <em>Ashmore, </em>\u00b6 5. We concluded our precedent did not reflect adoption of a \u201cstrict numerical requirement.\u201d <em>Ashmore, </em>\u00b6 15. Accordingly, we affirmed the district court\u2019s denial of the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss. <em>Ashmore, </em>\u00b6 24.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-7\">\u00b620  As we noted in <em>Ashmore, </em>it is the role of this Court when interpreting a statute \u201csimply to ascertain and declare what is in terms or substance contained therein, not to insert what has been omitted or to omit what has been inserted.\u201d Section 1-2-101, <em>MCA\u2022, Ashmore, </em>\u00b6 12. The disorderly conduct statute does not require evidence that more than one person was disturbed. Section 45-8-101, <em>MCA; Ashmore, </em>\u00b6 13. The statute requires only that the defendant knowingly disturbed the peace by committing one of the enumerated acts, including \u201cusing threatening, profane, or abusive language.\u201d Section 45-8-101(l)(c), MCA; <em>Ashmore, </em>\u00b6 13. There was sufficient evidence to support the conclusion that Nelson and Oltrogge disturbed the peace by directing profane and abusive language toward M.C. from their vehicle on a public street. Section 45-8-101(l)(c), MCA; <em>Ashmore, </em>\u00b6 24.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-8\">\u00b621 Nelson also argues the Municipal Court erred by taking her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>motion under advisement and allowing the City to present additional legal authorities, rather than making an immediate ruling. It is the duty of a judge to correctly interpret the law, not to make hasty and uninformed judgments. The Municipal Court performed its function properly by evaluating the relevant authorities and rendering a thoughtful ruling. The Municipal Court did not err when it denied Nelson\u2019s motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-4\">\u00b622 <em>Issue Two: Whether Nelson\u2019s speech constituted \u201cfighting words.\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"AG2\">\u00b623 The language of the disorderly conduct statute prohibiting use of \u201cthreatening, profane, or abusive language\u201d has been construed to apply only to \u201cfighting words.\u201d Section 45-8-101(1)(c), MCA; <em>State v. Robinson, </em>2003 MT 364, \u00b6 9, 319 Mont. 82, 82 P.3d 27. \u201cFighting words\u201d are \u201c \u2018those which by their very utterance inflict injury or tend to incite an immediate breach of the peace.\u2019 \u201d <em>City of Whitefish v. O\u2019Shaughnessy, </em>216 Mont. 433, 438, 704 P.2d 1021, 1024 (1985) (quoting <em>Chaplinsky v. N.H., </em>315 U.S. 568, 572, 62 S. Ct. 766, 769 (1942)). \u201cFighting words\u201d are characterized by their tendency to provoke a violent response in the listener. <em>Dugan, </em>\u00b6 20 (citing <em>Chaplinsky, </em>315 U.S. at 573, 62 S. Ct. at 770). They are excluded from the protections of the First Amendment because they form \u201c \u2018no essential part of any exposition of ideas, and are of such slight social value as a step to truth that any benefit that may be derived from them is clearly outweighed by the social interest in order and morality.\u2019 \u201d <em>O\u2019Shaughnessy, </em>216 Mont. at 438, 704 P.2d at 1024 (quoting <em>Chaplinsky, </em>315 U.S. at 572, 62 S. Ct. at 769). Racial slurs, including \u201cspic,\u201d may be considered \u201cfighting words.\u201d <em>See Dugan, </em>\u00b6 18 (\u201c \u201cResort to epithets or personal abuse is not in any proper sense communication of information or opinion safeguarded by the Constitution....\u2019 \u201d) (quoting <em>Chaplinsky, </em>315 U.S. at 572, 62 S. Ct. at 769); <em>State v. Hoshijo, </em>76 P.3d 550, 565 (Haw. 2003) (quoting <em>Taylor v. Metzger, </em>706 A.2d 685, 691 (N. J. 1998) (\u201cThe experience of being called \u2018nigger,\u2019 \u2018spic,\u2019 \u2018Jap,\u2019 or *kike\u2019 is like receiving a slap in the face. The injury is instantaneous.\u201d)). The potential to elicit an immediate violent response exists only where the communication occurs face-to-face or in close physical proximity. <em>Dugan, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 37-43. Telephone communications are not included within the fighting words doctrine, because there is no possibility the listener will react with immediate violence against the speaker. <em>Dugan, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 42-43.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-5\">\u00b624  Nelson argues the words \u201cspic bastard,\u201d though \u201charsh, co[a]rse, hurtful, vulgar, unpleasant, distasteful, or rude,\u201d are not fighting words. She also argues she was not face-to-face with M.C. because she remained inside her vehicle. The use of a racial slur is the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>type of speech that would, by its very utterance, inflict injury and tend to incite a breach of the peace. <em>See Dugan, </em>\u00b6 18; <em>Hoshijo, </em>76 P.3d at 565. The fact that Nelson and Oltrogge were in a car does not mean their speech could not have incited an immediate violent response from a listener on the street. <em>See Dugan, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 37-43. M.C. was close enough to recognize the women\u2019s faces and to hear their words clearly, even though they did not \u201choller\u201d them. Nelson\u2019s use of the term \u201cspic bastard\u201d constituted fighting words and was not constitutionally protected.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-4\">\u00b625 <em>Issue Three: Whether Nelson\u2019s constitutional rights were violated when the responding officer reported Nelson had refused to speak to him.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b476-5\">\u00b626 Nelson argues her constitutional rights were violated by Officer Becker\u2019s statement that Nelson had refused to speak to him, when it was her husband who told Officer Becker the family did not wish to answer any questions. Nelson claims Officer Becker\u2019s failure to speak with her during his investigation violated her Sixth Amendment right \u201cto be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation.\u201d U.S. Const, amend. VI. Nelson claims the warrant was improperly issued on the basis of this false statement. She also argues Officer Becker\u2019s statement was perjury and deprived her of her right to a fair trial.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AuR\">\u00b627 Nelson\u2019s claims are without merit. M.C.\u2019s statement identifying Nelson and Oltrogge and describing Oltrogge\u2019s vehicle was sufficient to establish probable cause for a warrant, regardless of Officer Becker\u2019s statements about his attempt to contact Nelson and Oltrogge. <em>State v. Sor-Lokken, </em>246 Mont. 70, 76, 803 P.2d 638, 642 (1990) (probable cause established by witness statements describing defendant and defendant\u2019s license plate). Nelson was notified of the nature and cause of the accusation by the complaint, which described the incident in detail, and the warrant, which identified the offense as disorderly conduct. Nelson did not have the right to be notified of the charges against her before those charges had been filed. <em>See Sor-Lokken, </em>246 Mont. at 76, 803 P.2d at 642 (defendant does not have a right to be present when charges are filed).</p>\n<p id=\"b476-6\">\u00b628 Nelson and Oltrogge were permitted to cross-examine Officer Becker extensively about his earlier statement that they had refused to speak with him. The circumstances of Officer Becker\u2019s attempted interview were fully explained at trial, and there is no evidence he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>committed peijury. While a defendant\u2019s invocation of the right to remain silent may not he used against him or her at trial, <em>State v. Wagner, </em>2009 MT 256, \u00b6 15, 352 Mont. 1, 215 P.3d 20, that did not occur here. Kevin Nelson\u2019s refusal was not equivalent to an invocation of Fifth Amendment rights by Nelson or Oltrogge. <em>Moran v. Burbine, </em>475 U.S. 412, 433 n.4, 106 S. Ct. 1135, 1147 n.4 (1986) (privilege against self-incrimination \u201ccan only be invoked by the individual whose testimony is being compelled.\u201d). Officer Becker did not claim at trial that Nelson or Oltrogge had refused to speak with him, and the prosecution made no reference to his earlier report. Rather, Nelson raised the issue for the first time on cross-examination, asking, \u201c[W]hy would you write that you talked to us?\u201d Nelson\u2019s constitutional rights were not violated by Officer Becker\u2019s initial report of his investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"Amsp\">\u00b629 <em>Issue Four: Whether the Municipal Court erred by not allowing Nelson to replay audio recordings that had already been admitted into evidence and requiring authentication of the McDonald\u2019s receipt.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b477-4\">\u00b630 Nelson argues the Municipal Court erred by not allowing her to replay audio recordings of the 911 call and Officer Becker\u2019s interview with M.C. and his mother. The recordings had already been played by the City and entered into evidence. Nelson was free to refer to statements made in the recordings when cross-examining M.C. or during argument. Playing the recordings repeatedly would have served no purpose other than to slow down the proceedings. <em>McAndrews v. Schwartz, </em>164 Mont. 402, 411, 523 P.2d 1379, 1385 (1974) (replay of testimony \u201cadded nothing new to the case\u201d). The Municipal Court did not abuse its discretion by refusing to allow Nelson to play the recordings a second time.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-5\">\u00b631  Nelson also argues the Municipal Court erred by requiring Oltrogge to act as her attorney for the purpose of authenticating the McDonald\u2019s receipt. The Municipal Court did not require Oltrogge to question Nelson. The Municipal Court informed Nelson the receipt would have to be authenticated before it could be received as evidence. The Municipal Court advised Nelson she could testify to the authenticity of the receipt herself, if she chose, but made clear she was not required to testify. Nelson was also free to present her authenticating testimony without questioning by Oltrogge. She was not entitled, however, to present unauthenticated evidence. M. R. Evid. 901; <em>State v. West, </em>245 Mont. 298, 302, 800 P.2d 1047, 1050 (1990). The Municipal Court did not abuse its discretion by requiring authentication of the McDonald\u2019s receipt.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-6\">\u00b632 <em>Issue Five: Whether the Municipal Court erred by considering the victim\u2019s age during sentencing.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b478-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>\u00b633 Nelson argues the Municipal Court improperly convicted her on the basis of M.C.\u2019s age. The Municipal Court referred to M.C.\u2019s age after the verdict had been rendered. The record gives no indication that the Municipal Court considered his age prior to the verdict. During sentencing, a court \u201cmay consider \u2018any matter relevant to the disposition\u2019 of an offender.\u201d <em>State v. Hill, </em>2009 MT 134, \u00b6 27, 350 Mont. 296, 207 P.3d 307 (quoting \u00a7 46-18-115(1), MCA). The Municipal Court explained its sentence by indicating that a different sentence may have been appropriate if the parties had all been adults. The Municipal Court was entitled to consider the victim\u2019s age as a factor during sentencing. <em>Hill, </em>\u00b6 27. The Municipal Court did not err.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-4\">\u00b634 <em>Issue Six: Whether Nelson\u2019s right to a fair trial was violated because the Municipal Court Judge Pro Tempore is a criminal defense attorney.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b478-5\">\u00b635 Nelson argues that because Judge Pro Tempore Lundvall is a criminal defense attorney, she suspects ex parte communications occurred and favors were exchanged with the City. She offers no factual basis for this belief. She did not raise this argument before either the Municipal Court or the District Court. As this argument is raised for the first time on appeal, we will not address it further. <em>Weaver, </em>\u00b6 38.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-6\">\u00b636 For the reasons stated above, Nelson\u2019s conviction of disorderly conduct is affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b478-7\">JUSTICES BAKER, COTTER, WHEAT and RICE concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b472-8\"> The receipt shows purchase of one large Diet Dr. Pepper with \u201clight ice,\u201d one large caramel frappe, and two chipotle barbecue snack wraps, grilled.
