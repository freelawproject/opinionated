We reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-5\">ISSUES</p>\n<p id=\"b293-6\">\u00b62 A restatement of the issues on appeal is:</p>\n<p id=\"b293-7\">\u00b63 <em>1. Did the District Court err in granting Plum Creek\u2019s motion for summary judgment?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b293-8\">\u00b64 <em>2. Did the District Court err in finding that the scope of the easement was not limited to logging operations?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b293-9\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b293-10\">\u00b65 This dispute involves real property located in Flathead County; specifically, it involves an easement located in lots 8 and 9 of Section 3 and in the southwest and southeast quarters of Section 2, Township 27 North, Range 22 West, P.M.M. In March 1972, Phyllis E. Hudson and Clarence G. Hudson granted an easement to Burlington Northern, Inc. Plaintiffs are the successors in interest to the Hudsons. Plum Creek is a successor to Burlington Northern, Inc. The easement is a road or driveway that runs north from Haywire Gulch, a public road, to Plum Creek\u2019s property, crossing Plaintiffs\u2019 property. Since the 1980s, Plum Creek employees and contractors have used the easement to conduct road inspections, road construction, slash burning, timber cruising, logging operations, and real estate activities.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-11\">\u00b66 According to the District Court\u2019s order, the \u201cNorth Gate\u201d is located on Plum Creek\u2019s properly above the property line with Whary. This was apparently confirmed by a 2011 survey. In his deposition, Whary testified that \u201c[t]he gate swings both ways,\u201d and that \u201cthe arm was in [his] property\u201d when he decided to lock the gate in 1999. He never gave Plum Creek a key to the lock. Steve Perrone, a Plum Creek employee, first encountered the locked gate in2009 and unsuccessfully demanded that Whary remove the lock. Whary also placed rocks, gravel, and a large boulder in front of the gate. He contends that he \u201cblocked off ... 40 feet\u201d of the easement and \u201cused it for storage of material.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b293-12\">\u00b67 Plaintiffs filed a complaint against Plum Creek in March 2011 to extinguish the scope of the easement. Plaintiffs subsequently amended <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>their complaint in May 2011 and March 2013. The second amended complaint raised four claims for relief: extinguishment of the easement due to the non-assignment provision; extinguishment of the easement due to non-use; extinguishment by reverse adverse possession; and limitation on use of the easement. Only the second and fourth claims are at issue in this appeal. On April 30,2013, Plaintiffs filed a motion for partial summary judgment only as to the fourth claim, seeking to limit Plum Creek\u2019s use of the easement to logging activities. On May 14, 2013, Plum Creek filed a motion for summary judgment on the entire complaint. After additional briefing on both motions, the District Court entered an order denying Plaintiffs\u2019 motion for partial summary judgment and granting Plum Creek\u2019s motion for summary judgment. Plaintiffs timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-4\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">\u00b68 We review de novo a district court\u2019s grant or denial of summary judgment, applying the same criteria of M. R. Civ. P. 56 as a district court. <em>Pilgeram. v. GreenPoint Mortg. Funding, Inc., </em>2013 MT 354, \u00b6 9, 373 Mont. 1, 313 P.3d 839 (citation omitted). We review a district court\u2019s conclusions of law to determine whether they are correct and its findings of fact to determine whether they are clearly erroneous. <em>Pilgeram, </em>\u00b6 9 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b294-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b294-7\">\u00b69 \u201cAn easement is a nonpossessory interest in land \u2014 a right which one person has to use the land of another for a specific purpose or a servitude imposed as a burden upon the land.\u201dMattson <em>v. Mont. Power Co., </em>2009 MT 286, \u00b6 16, 352 Mont. 212, 215 P.3d 675 (citation omitted). Here, the easement was created by a written instrument. Generally, \u201cwhere the creating words of a deed make the scope and the location of an easement perfectly clear, there is no need for further inquiry.\u201d <em>Guthrie v. Hardy, </em>2001 MT 122, \u00b6 46, 305 Mont. 367, 28 P.3d 467. \u201c[I]f the grant or reservation is specific in its terms, it is decisive of the limits of the easement.\u201d <em>Mattson, </em>\u00b6 17 (quoting <em>Guthrie, </em>\u00b6 46). However, \u201cwhere the grant or reservation is general in its terms, courts must look beyond the language of the deed in determining the breadth and scope of the servitude, which need only be such as is reasonably necessary and convenient for the purpose for which the easement was created.\u201d <em>Mattson, </em>\u00b6 17 (citing <em>Guthrie, </em>\u00b6 47).</p>\n<p id=\"b294-8\">\u00b610 The rules of contract interpretation govern the construction of a writing granting an interest in real property. <em>Mattson, </em>\u00b6 18 (citations <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>omitted). The construction and interpretation of a contract is a question of law. <em>Mattson, </em>\u00b6 18 (citations omitted). If possible, a contract must be interpreted to give effect to every part of the contract, and the intention of the parties must be ascertained from the writing alone. <em>Mattson, </em>\u00b6 18 (citations omitted). \u201cThe language of a contract is to govern its interpretation if the language is clear and explicit and does not involve an absurdity.\u201d <em>Mattson, </em>\u00b6 18 (citing \u00a7 28-3-401, MCA). Evidence of the circumstances under which the contract was made may be admissible but may not be used to add to, vary, or contradict the terms of the contract. <em>Mattson, </em>\u00b6 18 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b295-4\">\u00b611 With these principles in mind, we turn to Plaintiffs\u2019 contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"Ayi\">\u00b612 2. <em>Did the District Court err in granting Plum Creek\u2019s motion for summary judgment?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b295-5\">\u00b613 The easement in question included the following language regarding termination in the event of non-use:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-6\">If for a period of five (5) years the Grantee shall cease to use, or preserve for prospective future use, the road, or any segment thereof, for the purposes granted, or if at any time the Grantee determines that the road, or any segment thereof, is no longer needed for the purposes granted, the easement traversed thereby shall terminate.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b295-7\">\u00b614 Plaintiffs contend that though portions of the granting document are ambiguous, this section is not. Plaintiffs argue that the District Court did not address the language concerning failure to use or preserve \u201cany segment\u201d of the road, thereby failing to give meaning to all of the written terms of the agreement as required by \u00a7 28-2-905, MCA. They further argue that because they submitted evidence that, for a period in excess of five years, use of the easement was impeded by the locked gate, boulder, rocks, and gravel, there was an issue of material fact as to whether the easement had terminated. Plum Creek counters that it is irrelevant \u201c[w]hether or not the Plum Creek gate was locked or whether Whary placed a pile of gravel or boulders at the north end of the Easement\u201d because Plum Creek used the easement numerous times over the years.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-8\">\u00b615  We conclude the District Court erred when it failed to give meaning to the phrase \u201cor any segment thereof,\u201d as required by \u00a7 28-3-202, MCA. Section 28-3-202, MCA (\u201cThe whole of a contract is to be taken together so as to give effect to every part if reasonably practicable, each clause helping to interpret the other.\u201d). Plum Creek has not disputed that a segment of the easement was obstructed for a period of over five years, nor has it addressed the clear language of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>granting document that addresses failure to use \u201cany segment\u201d of the easement. Viewing Plaintiffs\u2019 evidence regarding the obstructed easement in the light most favorable to them as the nonmoving party, we conclude the District Court erred in granting Plum Creek\u2019s motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-4\">\u00b616 <em>2. Did the District Court err in finding that the scope of the easement was not limited to logging </em>operations?</p>\n<p id=\"b296-5\">\u00b617 The easement was originally granted for \u201cingress and egress over and across said road, said rights to be exercised in a manner that will not interfere with the use of the road by Grantee.\u201d The District Court concluded that Plum Creek \u201chas established that the easement is general in nature, that the original Grantor\u2019s property was developed into a residential use, and there is no legal justification to limit Plum Creek\u2019s present or prospective use to only logging operations.\u201d Plaintiffs argue that the District Court erred in relying upon the historical uses of the easement within the <em>servient </em>estate to determine the easement\u2019s scope; rather, it is the historic use of the dominant estate that is determinative. We agree with Plaintiffs on this point. <em>See </em>Section 70-17-106, MCA (\u201cThe extent of a servitude is determined by the terms of the grant or the nature of the enjoyment by which it was acquired.\u201d); <em>Ashby v. Maechling, </em>2010 MT 80, \u00b6 38, 356 Mont. 68, 229 P.3d 1210 (citing <em>Tungsten Holdings v. Kimberlin, </em>2000 MT 24, \u00b6 27, 298 Mont. 176, 994 P.2d 1114) (This Court has \u201cendorsed the concept that a decision on the scope of an implied easement should consider \u2018the actual uses being made [of the dominant estate] at the time of the severance, such uses as the facts and circumstances show were within the reasonable contemplation of the parties at the time of the conveyance, and such uses as the parties might reasonably have expected from future uses of the dominant tenement.\u2019 \u201d); <em>Mason v. Garrison, </em>2000 MT 78, \u00b6\u00b6 22, 24-27, 299 Mont. 142, 998 P.2d 531 (The Court analyzed the extent of the easement \u201cwith a view to the situation of the property and the surrounding circumstances,\u201d especially evidence of the historical use of the dominant estate.). Plaintiffs further argue that the scope of the easement must be limited to the sporadic logging related activities historically conducted by Plum Creek. Plum Creek counters that the District Court correctly concluded that it consistently used, preserved, and maintained the easement, and that the record establishes that the original grantors of the easement never intended to limit the easement\u2019s scope to a particular activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-6\">\u00b618  Because we reverse under Issue One, we also reverse the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>court\u2019s finding regarding the scope of the easement, which is a question of fact to be determined by the finder of fact on remand of this case. <em>See Guthrie, </em>\u00b6 47 (what may be considered a reasonable use of a general easement is usually a question of fact to be determined in light of the situation of the property and the surrounding circumstances).</p>\n<p id=\"b297-4\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b297-5\">\u00b619 For the foregoing reasons, we reverse and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b297-6\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES BAKER, McKINNON and WHEAT concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
