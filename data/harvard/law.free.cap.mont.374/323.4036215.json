The Honorable Katherine Curtis presided over that trial. After the prosecution rested at trial, Bullman moved for a directed verdict on the incest charge because the State failed to prove that Bullman had been married to M.T., the mother of J.T. The District Court denied the motion, relying on M.T.\u2019s testimony describing their relationship, that she had filed tax returns as married, and that she had legally dissolved the marriage. During Bullman\u2019s testimony, the State introduced a copy of the dissolution decree without objection from Bullman. After that evidence had been admitted, Bullman argued that Judge Curtis should not have decided the directed verdict issue, because Judge Curtis had previously issued the default judgment dissolving Bullman\u2019s marriage to M.T., J.T.\u2019s mother. Judge Curtis rejected Bullman\u2019s argument on the grounds that the defense had not previously objected to her ruling on the directed verdict, and that substantial evidence had been admitted proving that the marriage had existed.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-13\">\u00b63 Upon his conviction, Bullman appealed the denial of the directed verdict to this Court. <em>See State v. Bullman, </em>2009 MT 37, \u00b6\u00b6 17-23, 349 Mont. 228, 203 P.3d 768 <em>(Bullman I). </em>That appeal did not raise any issue concerning Judge Curtis\u2019 alleged conflict of interest based on the divorce decree. We affirmed Bullman\u2019s conviction, but reversed for resentencing to correct improper sentencing conditions on parole. <em>Bullman I, </em>\u00b6 39.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-14\">\u00b64 The present appeal stems from Bullman\u2019s petition for post-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>conviction relief (PCR) filed on May 19, 2010. Bullman alleged ineffective assistance of trial counsel (IAC), prosecutorial misconduct, failure of the prosecutor to disclose material evidence, inadmissibility of other acts evidence and improper exclusion of his expert. After the State responded, Bullman sought and received several extensions to gather evidence and file his reply. One day before his reply brief was due, on March 30, 2011, Bullman sought leave to file an amended petition. The District Court granted the motion to allow Bullman \u201cthe opportunity to submit further record and evidence to support his claims\u201d but specifically prohibited Bullman from asserting new claims such as IAC of appellate counsel. Bullman petitioned to this Court for supervisory control, alleging that the District Court erred when it denied his requests for discovery and improperly barred him from raising new claims in his amended PCR petition. We denied that petition in <em>Bullman v. Curtis, </em>362 Mont. 543, 272 P.3d 124 <em>(Bullman II).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b351-4\">\u00b65 Bullman then filed his amended PCR petition on October 22, 2012, which the District Court denied. Unbeknownst to Bullman, Judge Robert Allison had assumed the bench to replace Judge Curtis in the PCR proceeding. Judge Allison had previously represented M.T. in her divorce from Bullman. Bullman now appeals the denial of his amended PCR petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-5\">STANDARDS OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b351-6\">\u00b66 Appropriate standards of review will be addressed as they arise in this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b351-8\">\u00b67 <em>Did the District Court err by denying Bullman the right to raise additional claims in his Amended PCR Petition?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b351-9\">\u00b68 A district court may set deadlines in a PCR petition as it sees fit, and we review its decision for an abuse of discretion. <em>Sellner v. State, </em>2004 MT 205, \u00b6 16, 322 Mont. 310, 95 P.3d 708. Bullman argues that the District Court should have allowed his amended PCR petition to allege new claims not argued in the original PCR petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-10\">\u00b69 A district court may, by its own motion, set a deadline for amending an original petition. Section 46-21-105(1), MCA. \u201c[N]either ignorance of the law, nor the need for time to present a pro se defense, is an acceptable excuse for failing to timely file a petition for postconviction relief.\u201d <em>State v. Redcrow, </em>1999 MT 95, \u00b6 40, 294 Mont. 252, 980 P.2d 622 (citations omitted). In this case, the court found that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>Bullman filed his original petition \u201cat the eleventh hour\u201d after being granted extensions to gather evidence. The State responded to the petition, and Bullman requested an extension of time to file his reply. Nearly a year after filing his original petition, and one day before the deadline to file his reply, Bullman sought to amend his petition. The District Court granted the request, but limited Bullman\u2019s amendment to his original claims, reasoning that the addition of new claims would require the entire proceeding to \u201cessentially begin anew.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b352-4\">\u00b610  The District Court did not abuse its discretion in limiting the scope of the amended PCR petition to the claims in his original petition. The plain language of \u00a7 46-21-105(1), MCA, provides that a district court may set deadlines as it sees fit, as long as the court does not abuse its discretion or the PCR petition is not subject to the new evidence limitation under \u00a7 46-21-102(2), MCA. <em>Sellner, </em>\u00b6 16. Bullman was afforded severed extensions for his petition and reply, and those extensions were granted so that Bullman could gather more evidence to support his claims in the original petition. Bullman never revealed his intention to amend his original petition until well after these extensions were granted, and the State had replied. Bullman\u2019s new claims were not only untimely, they would have had the effect of commencing anew a PCR proceeding that had already exceeded one year. The District Court acted within its discretion in setting deadlines for Bullman\u2019s PCR petition and limiting claims raised to those set forth in the original petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-5\">\u00b611 <em>Did Judge Curtis have an impermissible conflict of interest based on her ruling in a previous civil case involving Bullman?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b352-6\">\u00b612 When a petitioner has been afforded the opportunity for a direct appeal of his conviction, grounds for relief that could reasonably have been raised on direct appeal may not be raised, considered, or decided in a PCR proceeding. Section 46-21-105(2), MCA. At trial, Bullman objected to the District Court\u2019s holding on the directed verdict because Judge Curtis had previously ruled on his divorce proceeding. Bullman had an opportunity to raise that argument in his appeal to this Court in <em>Bullman I, </em>but failed to do so. That failure constituted a waiver of the argument, and Bullman is now prohibited by statute from raising that argument in his PCR petition or appeal to this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-7\">\u00b613 <em>Did Judge Allison have an impermissible conflict of interest based on his previous representation of Bullman\u2019s wife in a divorce proceeding?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b352-8\">\u00b614 The well-established common law rule is that recusal is required when a judge has a direct, personal, substantial, or pecuniary interest <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>in a case. <em>Reichert v. State, </em>2012 MT 111, \u00b6 31, 365 Mont. 92, 278 P.3d 455 (citing <em>Caperton v. A. T. Massey Coal Co., </em>556 U.S. 868, 876-77, 129 S. Ct. 2252, 2259 (2009); <em>Aetna Life Ins. Co. v. Lavoie, </em>475 U.S. 813, 820, 106 S. Ct. 1580, 1584 (1986); <em>State ex rel. Mueller v. Tenth Jud. Dist. Ct., </em>87 Mont. 108, 114, 285 P. 928, 930 (1930)). \u201cIn Montana, such matters are addressed and governed by the 2008 Montana Code of Judicial Conduct. And \u2018[b]ecause the codes of judicial conduct provide more protection than due process requires, most disputes over disqualification will be resolved without resort to the Constitution. Application of the constitutional standard ... will thus be confined to rare instances.\u2019 \u201d <em>Reichert, </em>\u00b6 31 (citing <em>Capterton, </em>556 U.S. at 890, 129 S. Ct. at 2267). Montana\u2019s Code of Judicial Conduct Rule 2.12 requires that a judge disqualify himself \u201cin any proceeding in which the judge\u2019s impartiality might reasonably be questioned, including but not limited to the following circumstances: (1) The judge has a personal bias or prejudice concerning a parly or a party\u2019s lawyer, or personal knowledge of facts that are in dispute in the proceeding.\u201d A judge shall also disqualify himself if the judge \u201cserved as a lawyer in the matter in controversy.\u201d Mont. Code of Jud. Conduct 2.12(A)(5)(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b353-5\">\u00b615 Because the Code of Judicial Conduct was adopted by this Court in 2008, we recognize that our jurisprudence on this issue is underdeveloped. We have previously required recusal in analogous facts to this case, however. <em>See Shultz v. Hooks, </em>263 Mont. 234, 867 P.2d 1110 (1994). There, attorney Ted Lympus represented Shultz for several years in a guardianship accounting action and eventually withdrew representation, whereupon Shultz retained Hooks to complete the action. <em>Shultz, </em>263 Mont. at 237, 867 P.2d at 1112. Shultz later brought a malpractice action against Hooks in front of Judge Lympus, Shultz\u2019s original attorney in the accounting action. <em>Shultz, </em>263 Mont. at 236, 867 P.2d at 1111. We required disqualification of Judge Lympus based on \u00a7 3-1-803, MCA:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b353-6\">A judge is not prevented from presiding over matters which involved his or her prior clients if the action involves another matter. Although this malpractice action is technically a separate action from the underlying suit ... it arises from the legal representation in that [underlying] lawsuit, albeit the representation by Hooks and not that of Judge Lympus.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b353-7\"><em>Shultz, </em>263 Mont. at 237, 867 P.2d at 1112.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-8\">\u00b616 We later overruled <em>Shultz </em>in <em>In re Markegard, </em>2006 MT 111, \u00b6\u00b6 23-24, 332 Mont. 187, 136 P.3d 532 on the grounds that the plain language of \u00a7 3-1-803, MCA, only requires disqualification where <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>representation and adjudication both occurred in the same action, and therefore, a judge was not required to disqualify himself in a separate and related action. The plain language of Rule 2.12 is not as narrow, however, and requires disqualification when the judge has personal knowledge of disputed facts. Mont. Code of Jud. Conduct 2.12(A)(1). Nor is the Rule limited to previous representation in the same action, but rather, applies to previous representation in the <em>matter in controversy. </em>Mont. Code of Jud. Conduct 2.12(A)(5)(a). A \u201cmatter\u201d is defined as \u201c[sjomething that is to be tried or proved; an allegation forming the basis of a claim or defense... <em>\"Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>999 (Bryan A. Gamer ed., 8th ed., West 2007). A matter in controversy, therefore, includes any disputed factual allegation that is material to the resolution of a legal issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-5\">\u00b617  With this interpretation in mind, the plain language of Rule 2.12 clearly requires recusal when the judge has personal knowledge of disputed facts stemming from his previous representation of a client in a separate and related matter. Bullman\u2019s PCR petition alleged IAC on the grounds that his trial counsel failed to sufficiently contest Bullman\u2019s marriage to M.T. Because Judge Allison had previously represented M.T. in dissolving her marriage to Bullman, he had direct involvement and personal knowledge of the fact that Bullman was married to M.T., a factual issue that was material to Bullman\u2019s PCR petition. Under the plain language of Rule 2.12, Judge Allison was required to disqualify himself based on this personal knowledge. We therefore reverse the court\u2019s denial of Bullman\u2019s PCR petition, and remand to the District Court for assignment to a new judge who shall consider Bullman\u2019s amended PCR petition anew. In light of this ruling, we decline to reach the final two issues concerning Bullman\u2019s allegations of IAC and prosecutorial misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-6\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b354-7\">\u00b618 We affirm the District Court\u2019s limitation of new claims in Bullman\u2019s amended PCR petition, but remand for reconsideration of Bullman\u2019s amended PCR petition by a new judge. We decline to reach the merits of Bullman\u2019s amended PCR petition.</p>\n<judges id=\"b354-8\">JUSTICES BAKER, COTTER, McKINNON and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
