We affirm and address the following issues:</p>\n<p id=\"b65-5\">\u00b62 <em>1. Did the prosecutor commit plain error by commenting on witness credibility during closing argument?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b65-6\">\u00b63 <em>2. Did the District Court err by denying Walton\u2019s motion for a new trial after the court sua sponte questioned a key defense witness?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b65-7\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b65-8\">\u00b64 J.L. is the biological mother of K.T., J.B., and A.B. J.L. and Walton became romantically involved in 2008, and lived together off- and-on again for several years. Dining 2011, Walton resided with J.L. and her three children in Darby. On the evening of December 15,2011, K.T., eleven years old, watched television with her family and then went to bed. K.T. testified that at some time during the night, she awoke to Walton \u201cplopping down\u201d on her bed and kissing her on the lips. J.B., KT.\u2019s older half-brother, testified that he heard Walton enter KT.\u2019s room and say, Tm sleeping in here\u201d or \u201cI\u2019m sleeping with you.\u201d KT. explained that she eventually managed to fall back asleep, but was again awoken when Walton got out of her bed to use the restroom. When he returned, Walton lay down next to KT. and began to rub her leg. He lifted KT.\u2019s shirt and touched her chest but not her breasts. Walton then began to rub KT.\u2019s \u201clower area,\u201d which, she testified, felt \u201cbad.\u201d During the incident, Walton was \u201cgruntting]\u201d and the bed was shaking slightly. He stopped and left the room when J.L. coughed and turned on the hallway light.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-9\">\u00b65 In the morning, Walton and J.L. left for work together. Within ten minutes, K.T. disclosed the events of the previous night to J.B. and asked him what the difference was between being \u201craped and molested.\u201d The two children did not discuss the incident further on their way to school, but later that morning, J.B. contacted the school counselor and informed him of KT.\u2019s disclosure. Shortly thereafter, Deputy Jon Moles of the Darby Marshal\u2019s Office was dispatched to the Darby school to investigate KT.\u2019s sexual assault allegation. Deputy Moles interviewed J.B. and then drove to Walton\u2019s place of employment to interview him as well. KT. was sent to the First STEP Resource Center at St. Patrick\u2019s Hospital in Missoula to undergo a forensic interview with Mary Pat Hansen (Hansen).</p>\n<p id=\"b65-10\">\u00b66 The State subsequently charged Walton with two counts of felony sexual assault in violation of \u00a7 45-5-502, MCA. At trial, Walton relied on the defense theory that J.B. pressured KT. into fabricating the sexual assault allegation in order to get him out of the family\u2019s home. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>He testified that J.B. resented his authority and described their relationship as \u201cincredibly difficult.\u201d J.L., the children\u2019s mother, supported Walton\u2019s defense theory and testified on his behalf. At the outset of her testimony, J.L. stated the first and last names of each of her three children. Each of the children has a different father and, thus, a different last name. After J.L. concluded, the District Court engaged her in the following line of questioning:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b66-5\">THE COURT: Ma\u2019am, I have a few questions for you. I\u2019m trying to get the family figured out. Your oldest child is [A.B.]?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b66-6\">THE WITNESS: [A.B.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b66-7\">THE COURT: Who is her father?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b66-8\">THE WITNESS: [F.B.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b66-9\">THE COURT: Who was that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b66-10\">THE WITNESS: [F.B.], B....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b66-11\">THE COURT: Okay. Where does he live?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b66-12\">THE WITNESS: Morenci, Arizona.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b66-13\">THE COURT: And then [J.B.\u2019s] father is who?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b66-14\">THE WITNESS: He doesn\u2019t have one. He signed his rights over. THE COURT: Well, who is his birth father?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b66-15\">THE WITNESS: [L.B.] He signed his rights over.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b66-16\">THE COURT: [L.B.]?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b66-17\">THE WITNESS: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b66-18\">THE COURT: And who is [KT.\u2019s] father?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b66-19\">THE WITNESS: [N.T.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b66-20\">THE COURT: Now, [J.B.] said he was living with his brother. Is his brother your son?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b66-21\">THE WITNESS: No. It\u2019s my ex-husband\u2019s son.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b66-22\">THE COURT: So this would be his stepbrother?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b66-23\">THE WITNESS: His stepbrother, yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b66-24\">THE COURT: All right.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b66-25\">Following this exchange, the court provided both parties the opportunity to further question J.L., but they declined, and the witness was excused.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-26\">\u00b67 Hansen testified about her forensic interview with KT. and the subsequent medical evaluation she performed. Hansen stated that her medical evaluation did not reveal any significant physical findings, but explained that her conversation with K.T. caused her to believe \u201cthat [KT.\u2019s] statements [were] consistent with a child who has experienced sexual abuse.\u201d As a result, Hansen recommended that KT. undergo therapy.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-27\">\u00b68 During closing argument, the prosecutor referenced KT.\u2019s and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>Hansen\u2019s testimony to argue extensively that K.T. had experienced sexual abuse:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b67-5\">The sexual assault that [K.T.] experienced, I think it\u2019s interesting how Ms. Hansen, Mary Pat Hansen, with all of her background, hundreds of kids she\u2019s interviewed, hundreds of kids she\u2019s worked with, and the way that she expresses her opinion, the way she expresses that expert opinion is that what [K.T.] disclosed to her was consistent with a child who has experienced sexual assault. Not consistent with some story of sexual assault, not consistent with a version of sexual assault; consistent with an experience of sexual assault ....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b67-6\">What is it you are seeing, this is someone who experienced something as opposed to someone who is simply trying to tell a story.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b67-7\">But she knew what happened because she had experienced it. He kissed me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b67-8\">The sensations that she\u2019s able to describe are not made up. They are experienced.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b67-9\">And he said she\u2019s struggling with what all this means because she experienced it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b67-10\">Five months later she described the same experience. Here we are roughly five months after that, she sat in here and described the same experience. This is an 11-year old girl that the Defendant would have you believe is maintaining a complex, rather \u2014 for 11, a rather sophisticated experience that whole time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b67-11\">[J.B.] tells what he experienced. Because the next thing he experiences is a few hours later when his sister comes to him and says, Hey, they are playing the Wii, getting ready for school, whatever, not asking her mom, not asking her sister, she asks her brother. Tell me what the difference is between rape and molesting because 1 think one of those happened to me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b67-12\">But everything else came from [K.T.] because she experienced it. She talked about it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b67-13\">The prosecutor continued during rebuttal closing:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b68-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>They are asking an 11-year-old girl to maintain a complex, sophisticated, two levels \u2014 someone told her what to say, meaning [J.B.] told her what to say. She was able then to turn around and say it with enough sophistication, complexity, sensations, all the things that she would be expected to be able to say if she experienced it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b68-5\">It doesn\u2019t make any sense. He just \u2014 [K.T.] was sexually assaulted.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AOJ\">\u00b69 The jury convicted Walton on one count of sexual assault and acquitted him of the other count. He moved for a new trial pursuant to \u00a7 46-16-702, MCA, but the District Court denied his motion. Walton was sentenced to a state prison designated by the Department of Corrections for a period of twenty years, with ten years suspended on conditions. Walton appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-6\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b68-7\">\u00b610 \u201cWe generally \u2018do not address issues of prosecutorial misconduct pertaining to a prosecutor\u2019s statements not objected to at trial.\u2019 \u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Aker, </em>2013 MT 253, \u00b6 21, 371 Mont. 491, 310 P.3d 506 (quoting <em>State v. Longfellow, </em>2008 MT 343, \u00b6 24, 346 Mont. 286, 194 P.3d 694). However, we may review such an issue under the plain error doctrine. <em>Aker, </em>\u00b6 21 (citation omitted). Plain-error review is appropriate only in those \u201c \u2018situations that implicate a defendant\u2019s fundamental constitutional rights when failing to review the alleged error may result in a manifest miscarriage of justice, leave unsettled the question of the fundamental fairness of the proceedings, or compromise the integrity of the judicial process.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. McDonald, </em>2013 MT 97, \u00b6 8, 369 Mont. 483, 299 P.3d 799 (citations omitted). Plain-error review is discretionary and is applied sparingly on a case-by-case basis. <em>McDonald, </em>\u00b6 8 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b68-8\">\u00b611 We review a district court\u2019s denial of a motion for a new trial for abuse of discretion. <em>State v. Ugalde, </em>2013 MT 308, \u00b6 26, 372 Mont. 234, 311 P.3d 772 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b68-9\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b68-10\">\u00b612 2. <em>Did the prosecutor commit plain error by commenting on witness credibility during closing argument?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b68-11\">\u00b613 \u201cBoth the Sixth Amendment of the United States Constitution and Article H, Section 24 of the Montana constitution guarantee criminal defendants the right to a fair trial by a jury.\u201d <em>State v. Hayden, </em>2008 MT 274, \u00b6 27, 345 Mont. 252, 190 P.3d 1091. Prosecutorial misconduct <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>\u201c \u2018may be grounds for reversing a conviction and granting a new trial if the conduct deprives the defendant of a fair and impartial trial.\u2019 \u201d <em>McDonald, </em>\u00b6 10 (quoting <em>Hayden, </em>\u00b6 27). However, this Court \u201c \u2018will not presume prejudice from the alleged misconduct, rather the defendant must show that the argument violated his substantial rights.\u2019 \u201d <em>McDonald, </em>\u00b6 10 (quoting <em>State v. Makarchuk, </em>2009 MT 82, \u00b6 24, 349 Mont. 507, 204 P.3d 1213). We evaluate a prosecutor\u2019s statements during closing argument in the context of the argument as a whole. <em>Ugalde, </em>\u00b6 62 (citation omitted). \u201cA prosecutor\u2019s argument is not plain error if made in the context of discussing the evidence presented and how it should be used to evaluate a witness\u2019s testimony under the principles set forth in the jury instructions.\u201d <em>Aker, </em>\u00b6 27 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b69-4\">\u00b614 Walton argues that the \u201cprosecutor violated [his] right to a fair trial by repeatedly and improperly characterizing K.T. and J.B.\u2019s testimony as truthful because they testified to what they, in his personal opinion, \u2018experienced\u2019 as opposed to repeating a \u2018story\u2019 or fabrication.\u201d He asserts \u201c[t]he prosecutor used \u2018experience\u2019 and \u2018experienced\u2019 to convince the jury he possessed personal, omniscient knowledge Walton in fact sexually assaulted KT.\u201d Walton argues this conduct invaded the province of the jury and violated the principle that a \u201c \u2018prosecutor should not express his or her personal belief or opinion as to the truth or falsity of any testimony or evidence or the guilt of the defendant,\u2019 \u201d citing ABA <em>Standards for Criminal Justice: Prosecution Function and Defense Function, </em>Standard 3-5.8(b), 106 (3d ed., ABA 1993). Walton relies heavily on our decision in <em>Hayden </em>to support his conclusion that plain-error review is warranted in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-5\">\u00b615 The State answers that the prosecutor \u201cbased his closing remarks upon the evidence and properly argued to the jury what it could infer from the evidence.\u201d The State cites cases in which this Court has declined to exercise plain-error review of a prosecutor\u2019s allegedly improper comments: <em>Ugalde, </em>\u00b6 62 (prosecutor purported to speak as a young victim); <em>Aker, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 25, 31 (prosecutor allegedly commented on witness credibility); <em>State v. Lacey, </em>2012 MT 52, \u00b6\u00b6 18-19, 26, 364 Mont. 291, 272 P.3d 1288 (prosecutor discussed whether certain witnesses were candid and stated, \u201cby God, he is [guilty].\u201d); <em>State v. Arlington, </em>265 Mont. 127, 157-58, 875 P.2d 307, 325 (1994) (prosecutor mentioned \u201ca number of times, that [the defendant] had lied to the jury.\u201d); <em>State v. Lindberg, </em>2008 MT 389, \u00b6\u00b6 33-35, 347 Mont. 76, 196 P.3d 1252 (prosecutor characterized a defense witness \u201cas a \u2018liar\u2019 while arguing the State\u2019s evidence was genuine and truthful.\u201d); <em>State v. Rose, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>2009 MT 4, \u00b6\u00b6 105, 107, 348 Mont. 291, 202 P.3d 749, <em>superseded in part on other grounds, State v. Stops, </em>2013 MT 131, 370 Mont. 226, 301 P.3d 811 (prosecutor argued the defendant had told \u201c \u2018the big lie\u2019 \u201d to the jury because he believed they were gullible and naive); and <em>State v. Rodgers, </em>257 Mont. 413, 416, 419, 849 P.2d 1028, 1030, 1032 (1993) (prosecutor told the jurors that the defendant lied to their faces and described another witness\u2019s testimony as a deliberate lie).</p>\n<p id=\"b70-4\">\u00b616 In <em>Hayden, </em>the State charged Hayden with felony drug possession, misdemeanor possession of drug paraphernalia, and misdemeanor partner/family member assault after a search of Hayden\u2019s home substantiated Hayden\u2019s son\u2019s statements to police about Hayden\u2019s methamphetamine use and violent behavior. <em>Hayden, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 5-7. Hayden pled not guilty to all of the charges and proceeded to trial. <em>Hayden, </em>\u00b6 8. During the State\u2019s case-in-chief, the prosecutor elicited opinion testimony from the investigating officer about the truthfulness of other witnesses. <em>Hayden, </em>\u00b6 12. Then, during closing argument, the prosecutor told the jury that, in particular, two of the State\u2019s witnesses were \u201c \u2018believable\u2019 \u201d and that the jury could \u201c \u2018rely on\u2019 \u201d the investigating officer\u2019s testimony. The prosecutor also informed the jury that the search of Hayden\u2019s home had been conducted properly, and that the officers do \u201c \u2018good work.\u2019 \u201d Finally, the prosecutor stated that he was sure all of the items discovered during the search were related to drugs. <em>Hayden, </em>\u00b6 14. On appeal, this Court determined to exercise plain-error review, finding that the prosecutor \u201cimpinged on the jury\u2019s role by offering his own opinion as to witnesses\u2019 testimony\u201d and \u201cimproperly testified... by vouching for the efficacy of the search of Hayden\u2019s residence.\u201d <em>Hayden, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 32-33. Moreover, the prosecutor impermissibly questioned the investigating officer \u201con the credibility of other witnesses.\u201d <em>Hayden, </em>\u00b6 31. Such conduct, we explained, \u201cleaves unsettled the question of the ftmdamental fairness of the proceedings.\u201d <em>Hayden, </em>\u00b6 33.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-5\">\u00b617  Unlike <em>Hayden, </em>we do not believe the prosecutor\u2019s statements in the instant case rise to the level of plain error under the governing standards of review. The prosecutor did not directly opine about the truthfulness of a witness, offer his own testimony, or elicit credibility testimony from other witnesses. We acknowledge that the prosecutor\u2019s comments could indicate a level of personal conviction and belief in the victim\u2019s testimony. However, as the State points out, \u201c[i]mplicit in any prosecutor\u2019s closing argument is the prosecutor\u2019s belief that the State\u2019s witnesses are telling the truth \u2014 otherwise the prosecutor could not ethically be arguing a case to a jury.\u201d Furthermore, nothing in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>record convinces us that \u201cfailing to review the alleged error may result in a manifest miscarriage of justice, leave unsettled the question of the fundamental fairness of the proceedings, or compromise the integrity of the judicial process.\u201d <em>McDonald, </em>\u00b6 8. Therefore, we need not further address the merits of Walton\u2019s argument. This Court \u201cwill not set a precedent of presenting full analysis whenever a party asserts that an issue not properly preserved for appeal constitutes plain error.\u201d <em>State v. Daniels, </em>2003 MT 247, \u00b6 28, 317 Mont. 331, 77 P.3d 224. Walton \u201cwaived [his] right to raise this claim on appeal by failing to object to the State\u2019s closing arguments during trial.\u201d <em>Ugalde, </em>\u00b6 62.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-4\">\u00b618 <em>2. Did the District Court err by denying Walton\u2019s motion for a new trial after the court sua sponte questioned a key defense witness?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b71-5\">\u00b619 Section 46-16-702(1), MCA, provides in pertinent part: \u201cFollowing a verdict or finding of guilty, the court may grant the defendant a new trial if required in the interest of justice.\u201d It is essential to due process that a judge presides impartially in a criminal trial. <em>State v. Stafford, </em>208 Mont. 324, 329, 678 P.2d 644, 647 (1984). \u201c[I]n our adversarial system... the role of the trial judge is to regulate the proceedings and ensure that the trial is fair.\u201d <em>State v. Price, </em>2006 MT 79, \u00b6 21, 331 Mont. 502, 134 P.3d 45 (citation omitted). To this end, a judge must avoid \u201c \u2018officious interference\u2019 \u201d in the proceedings. <em>Price, </em>\u00b6 22 (quoting <em>State v. Richardson, </em>69 Mont. 400, 403-04, 222 P. 418, 419 (1924)). However, a judge need not \u201cremain silent and passive throughout a jury trial....\u201d <em>Price, </em>\u00b6 22 (citation omitted). Montana Rule of Evidence 611(a) requires a district court to \u201cexercise reasonable control over the mode and order of interrogating witnesses and presenting evidence so as to (1) make the interrogation and presentation effective for the ascertainment of the truth ... .\u201d Indeed \u201c[t]he court may interrogate witnesses, whether called by itself or a party; provided, however, that in trials before a jury, the court\u2019s questioning must be cautiously guarded so as not to constitute express or implied comment.\u201d M. R. Evid. 614(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b71-6\">\u00b620 Following the jury\u2019s verdict, Walton moved for a new trial based on the District Court\u2019s decision to question J.L. regarding the identities of her children\u2019s fathers. The District Court denied Walton\u2019s motion, concluding that \u201c[a]fter review of the trial transcript excerpt and the Minute Entry of trial,... [the Court\u2019s] questioning at the close of [J.L.\u2019s] testimony elicited no negative character evidence, should have caused [ J.L.] no embarrassment, and did nothing to impeach [J.L.\u2019s] credibility in the eyes of the jury.\u201d The District Court determined that all of the information elicited from J.L. during its questioning \u201cwas in evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>prior to the Court\u2019s questions,\u201d and that it had conducted the inquiry only because \u201cthe family ties as described by the child witnesses during the State\u2019s case [were] somewhat confusing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b72-4\">\u00b621 Walton argues that the District Court\u2019s \u201cimproper inquiry\u201d denied him a fair trial by placing J.L.\u2019s prior sexual conduct at issue. He characterizes J.L.\u2019s testimony as \u201ccrucial to [his] defense,\u201d and maintains that his conviction resulted from the jury rejecting J.L.\u2019s \u201cimplicitt ] if not explicit ]\u201d testimony that her children lied in this case. According to Walton, the District Court\u2019s inquiry \u201chad no relevance to any issue raised during the trial... [and] had the practical effect of conveying the impression J.L. was promiscuous \u2014 amounting to an attack on her credibility by using improper character evidence.\u201d Walton further argues that the prosecutor was able to capitalize on the District Court\u2019s \u201cimproper elicitation\u201d by \u201ccasting] further aspersions on [J.L.\u2019s] character, credibility, and fitness as mother\u201d during closing argument, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b72-5\">I thought it\u2019s important for you to know how badly [ J.L.] is willing to throw her son under the bus.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b72-6\">But she\u2019s willing to come in here and chuck little \u2014 big [J.B.] underneath the bus....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b72-7\">Why is she so willing to throw [J.B.] under the bus for this guy?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b72-8\">Why? Because she\u2019s willing to throw her kids under the bus for this guy.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b72-9\">During rebuttal closing the prosecutor stated:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b72-10\">Oh, and there\u2019s proof because there\u2019s no counseling for [K.T.] because mother of the year decided she doesn\u2019t need counseling. I\u2019ll leave that alone.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b72-11\">\u00b622 The State responds that the District Court \u201cdid nothing more than ask some brief clarifying questions about matters already in the record to clear up its confusion about familial relationships.\u201d Such an inquiry, the State argues, did not call J.L.\u2019s credibility into question and did not serve to deny Walton a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-12\">\u00b623  Although the District Court should have been more circumspect aboutthe potential of bringingimproper attention to J.L.\u2019s background, all of the information elicited by the court during its inquiry had already been presented to the jury through appropriate questioning by counsel. We cannot conclude that the court\u2019s brief summation \u201cconstitute^] express or implied comment,\u201d M. R. Evid. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>614(b), about J.L.\u2019s character or credibility. By clarifying which of J.L.\u2019s children belonged to which father, the court did not call into question J.L.\u2019s morality or impugn the truthfulness of her testimony. Moreover, we fail to see the connection between the District Court\u2019s inquiry and the prosecutor\u2019s closing remarks that Walton seeks to draw. Certainly, prosecutors should avoid using derogatory language and epithets at trial. <em>State v. White, </em>151 Mont. 151, 161, 440 P.2d 269, 275 (1968). However, the District Court did not \u201copen[] the door\u201d to the prosecutor\u2019s comments, and any perceived basis for objection to those comments could have been raised and addressed during the trial. We conclude the District Court did not abuse its discretion when it determined that a new trial was not warranted in the interest of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-4\">\u00b624 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b73-5\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES McKINNON, WHEAT and BAKER concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
