Did the District Court err in concluding that the Commission did not violate Plaintiffs\u2019 right of suffrage?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b371-8\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b371-9\">\u00b66 This case arises out of the 2013 redistricting of the Montana Legislature into 100 house districts and 50 senate districts. Specifically, the case below involves the assignment of two \u201choldover senators.\u201d A \u201choldover senator\u201d is a senator elected under the old districting system who must be assigned to a redrawn district to serve the final two years of his or her term. A \u201choldover senator\u201d is, therefore, not required to seek election at the general election held immediately following implementation of the districting plan.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"A6n\">\u00b67 Montana\u2019s legislative districts are determined after each federal census by an appointed commission according to the terms of Article V, Section 14 of the Montana Constitution. After the Commission is formed, it must prepare a plan for redistricting and submit the plan to the Legislature during its regular session. The Legislature then has 30 days to make recommendations and return the plan to the Commission. Within 30 days of receiving the recommendations, the Commission must file a final plan with the Secretary of State. Once the plan is filed, it becomes law, and the Commission dissolves.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-10\">\u00b68 A federal census was conducted in 2010. As required by the Montana Constitution, the legislative leadership appointed four members to the Commission. Because those members failed to timely select a fifth member, the Montana Supreme Court appointed the fifth member, James M. Regnier (Chairman Regnier). The Commission submitted its final plan to the Secretary of State on February 12,2013, and dissolved. Mont. Const, art. V, \u00a7 14(4)-(5).</p>\n<p id=\"b371-11\">\u00b69 In 2010, Llew Jones (Jones) was elected to the Montana Senate in Senate District 14. After the districts were redrawn, his residence was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>in Senate District 9. The Commission originally assigned Senator Rick Ripley (Ripley) to Senate District 9. Jones was not a \u201choldover senator\u201d and, thus, would be not be able to run for re-election until 2016. Government and community leaders from north-central Montana sent letters to the Commission asking it to assign Jones to a senate district in which he could run in 2014. On January 27, 2013, a bipartisan group of six senators, six representatives, and four community leaders submitted a letter with the same request.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-4\">\u00b610 Prior to the Commission\u2019s final meeting on February 12,2013, the Commissioners talked one-on-one about these public requests and how best to address them. At the Commission\u2019s final meeting, a majority of Commission members voted to assign Ripley to Senate District 10 and Senator Bradley Hamlett to Senate District 15. Because of these assignments, Senate District 9 had no \u201choldover senator,\u201d and Jones would be able to run there in 2014. The Commission gave an opportunity for public comment at this final meeting, of which there was none, and then adopted and submitted the final redistricting plan, which included the so-called \u201cLlew Jones amendment\u201d (Jones Amendment).</p>\n<p id=\"b372-5\">\u00b611 On March 14,2013, Plaintiffs filed a complaint against the State seeking injunctive and declaratory relief in the Fourteenth Judicial District Court, Wheatland County. In their initial complaint, Plaintiffs alleged the following causes of action: denial of the right of suffrage in violation of Article II, Section 13 of the Montana Constitution (Section 13) (Count I); denial of the right to participate in violation of Article II, Section 8 of the Montana Constitution (Section 8) (Count II); failure to submit the redistricting plan to the Legislature in violation of Article V, Section 14(4) of the Montana Constitution (Count III); denial of equal protection in violation of Article II, Section 4 of the Montana Constitution (Count IV); denial of equal protection (inverse class of one) in violation of Article II, Section 4 of the Montana Constitution (Count V); unlawful consideration of an incumbent legislator\u2019s address in redistricting in violation of \u00a7 5-l-115(3)(a), MCA (Count VI); and unlawful consideration of previous election results in redistricting in violation of \u00a7 5-1-115(3), MCA (Count VII). Plaintiffs later stipulated to the dismissal of Counts IV, V, VI, and VII.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-6\">\u00b612 On May 8,2013, the State filed a motion for change of venue from Wheatland County to Lewis and Clark County. The District Court granted the motion and transferred the proceedings to the First Judicial District, Lewis and Clark County. On July 31,2013, Plaintiffs filed an amended complaint alleging an additional cause of action: failure to permit public observation of agency deliberations in violation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>of Article II, Section 9 of the Montana Constitution (Section 9) (Count VIII). The parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment. On December 6, 2013, the District Court issued an order granting the State\u2019s motion for summary judgment and denying Plaintiffs\u2019 motion for summary judgment. Plaintiffs timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b373-6\">\u00b613 We review de novo a district court\u2019s grant or denial of summary judgment, applying the same criteria of M. R. Civ. P. 56 as a district court. <em>Pilgeram v. GreenPoint Mortg. Funding, Inc., </em>2013 MT 354, \u00b6 9, 373 Mont. 1, 313 P.3d 839 (citation omitted). We review a district court\u2019s conclusions of law to determine whether they are correct and its findings of fact to determine whether they are clearly erroneous. <em>Pilgeram, </em>\u00b6 9 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b373-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b373-8\">\u00b614 Section 9 provides: \u201cNo person shall be deprived of the right to examine documents or to observe the deliberations of all public bodies or agencies of state government and its subdivisions, except in cases in which the demand of individual privacy clearly exceeds the merits of public disclosure.\u201d Mont. Const, art. II, \u00a7 9. The Legislature has promulgated guidelines to protect the Section 9 guarantees at \u00a7\u00a7 2-3-201 through -221, MCA (open meeting statutes). Section 8 provides: \u201cThe public has the right to expect governmental agencies to afford such reasonable opportunity for citizen participation in the operation of the agencies prior to the final decision as may be provided by law.\u201d Mont. Const, art. II, \u00a7 8. The Legislature has codified guidelines to protect the Section 8 guarantees at \u00a7\u00a7 2-3-101 through -114, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"AJH\">\u00b615 According to the statutory guidelines, the \u201cactions and deliberations of all public agencies shall be conducted openly,\u201d and \u201c[a]ll meetings of public or governmental bodies... must be open to the public.\u201d Sections 2-3-201, -203, MCA. A \u201cmeeting\u201d is \u201cthe convening of a quorum of the constituent membership of a public agency... to hear, discuss, or act upon a matter over which the agency has supervision, control, jurisdiction, or advisory power.\u201d Section 2-3-202, MCA. The public must receive adequate notice and an opportunity for participation \u201cbefore a final agency action is taken that is of significant interest to the public.\u201d Section 2-3-103, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-9\">\u00b616 As indicated in the language in the constitutional provisions, Section 9 is broader in its application than Section 8. <em>Bryan v. Yellowstone Co. Elem. Sch. Dist. No. </em>2, 2002 MT 264, \u00b6 25, 312 Mont. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>257, 60 P.3d 381. Section 9 applies to both public and governmental bodies. A \u201cpublic or governmental body\u201d is a group of individuals organized for a governmental or public purpose. <em>Bryan, </em>\u00b6 25 (citation omitted). There is no dispute that the Commission constituted a \u201cpublic or governmental body\u201d subject to the strictures of Section 9. Section 8, by contrast, applies only with respect to \u201cgovernmental agencies.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b374-4\">\u00b617 \u201cStatutory language must be construed according to its plain meaning, and if the language is clear and unambiguous, no further interpretation is required.\u201d <em>Weber v. Interbel Tel. Coop., Inc., </em>2003 MT 320, \u00b6 10, 318 Mont. 295, 80 P.3d 88. When resolving disputes of constitutional construction, we apply the rules of statutory construction and give a broad and liberal interpretation to the Constitution. The intent of the framers of the Constitution controls and is determined from the plain language of the words used. <em>Bryan, </em>\u00b6 23 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">\u00b618 With these principles in mind, we turn to Plaintiffs\u2019 contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"APt\">\u00b619 <em>1. Did the District Court err in concluding that the Commission did not violate the public\u2019s \u201cright to know?\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b374-6\">\u00b620 Plaintiffs argue that \u201c[wjhile the Commission went to great lengths during most of its existence to encourage openness and public participation, it missed the mark regarding the last-minute holdover amendment it approved on February 12.\u201d Plaintiffs argue that the Commissioners\u2019 one-on-one discussions about opening Senate District 9 for Jones should have been observable by the public. According to Plaintiffs, the \u201cright to know\u201d under Section 9 includes the right to observe government deliberations that occur when a majority of the governing members communicate one-on-one amongst themselves regarding a matter within their jurisdiction. Plaintiffs cite cases from other jurisdictions in which courts have adopted this \u201cconstructive-quorum\u201d or \u201cwalking-quorum\u201d rule. According to Plaintiffs, \u201c[rejection of the constructive-quorum rule by this Court would diminish government transparency in Montana\u201d and would mean \u201cMontanans\u2019 constitutional right to observe government deliberations will have less force than analogous statutory rights in other states\u201d (emphasis omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b374-7\">\u00b621 The State counters that Plaintiffs\u2019 claim is time-barred because Plaintiffs did not amend their complaint to include a Section 9 claim until July 23, 2013, 139 days after the Commission\u2019s February 12 decision. <em>See </em>\u00a7 2-3-213, MCA (\u201cA suit to void a decision must be commenced within 30 days of the date on which the plaintiff or petitioner leams, or reasonably should have learned, of the agency\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>decision.\u201d). Furthermore, the State contends that the Commission never violated Section 9 because a \u201cquorum\u201d of the Commission did not meet outside of a public meeting and the Commissioners did not \u201cdeliberate\u201d as the Commission with respect to the Jones Amendment until the February 12 meeting.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-4\">\u00b622 We agree with Plaintiffs that this claim was timely. It related back to the date of the original pleading because it \u201cassert[ed] a claim or defense that arose out of the conduct, transaction, or occurrence set out \u2014 or attempted to be set out \u2014 in the original pleading.\u201d M. R. Civ. P. 15(c)(1)(B). Thus, we resolve this claim on the basis of its merits, and not on the basis of the time bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-5\">\u00b623 The open meeting statutes \u201cshall be liberally construed,\u201d \u00a7 2-3-201, MCA, and \u201capply to a \u2018meeting,\u2019 which occurs upon the \u2018convening\u2019 of a \u2018quorum\u2019 of the \u2018constituent membership of a public agency.\u2019 \u201d <em>Boulder Monitor v. Jefferson High Sch. Dist. No. </em>1, 2014 MT 5, \u00b6 19, 373 Mont. 212, 316 P.3d 848 (citing \u00a7 2-3-202, MCA). It is undisputed that the Commission consists of five members; thus, a gathering of three or more members of the Commission constitutes a quorum of the Commission.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Other jurisdictions recognize that their open meeting laws do not apply when a quorum is not present. <em>See e.g. Dewey v. Redevelopment Agency of Reno, </em>64 P.3d 1070, 1077-78 (Nev. 2003) (The Nevada Supreme Court declined to find that \u201cback-to-back briefings\u201d of the members of the City of Reno\u2019s Redevelopment Agency \u201ccreated a constructive quorum or serial communication in violation of\u2019 Nevada\u2019s Open Meeting Law.); <em>Dillman v. Trustees of Ind. Univ., </em>848 N.E.2d 348, 351 (Ind. 2006) (The court concluded that although the law must be liberally construed, the legislature has specifically defined meeting under the Open Door Law as a gathering of a majority of the governing body, and that without a majority present, no meeting occurs for purposes of the Open Door Law.).</p>\n<p id=\"b375-6\">\u00b624 We have not expressly addressed the \u201cconstructive-quorum\u201d rule before, but we have previously allowed \u201ca member of a public body [to observe] a meeting of a sub-quorum subcommittee\u201d and to ask questions during the meeting because \u201cdoing so does not constitute the convening of a quorum.\u201d <em>Boulder Monitor, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 20-21 (\u201cNothing in the letter or spirit of the open meeting statutes prohibits a person in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>position of the fourth member [of the School Board] in this case from attending and observing a meeting of a subcommittee along with any other members of the public.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b376-4\">\u00b625  We decline to adopt the \u201cconstructive-quorum\u201d rule under the facts presented here. Even liberally construing the statute, we determine that the language of \u00a7 2-3-202, MCA, is plain and unambiguous, and that the definition of \u201cmeeting\u201d does not include \u201cserial one-on-one discussions.\u201d Plaintiffs disregard as \u201cunfounded\u201d any concern that the \u201cconstructive-quorum\u201d rule would prohibit legislators from meeting in the halls of the Capitol and discussing pending legislation. However, if we accept Plaintiffs\u2019 premise that accumulated one-on-one conversations among Commission members violate the open meeting statutes, then so too could the accumulated discussions of legislators. There is no evidence that a majority of Commissioners reached any agreement regarding the Jones Amendment prior to the February 12 meeting, and no decisions were made outside of the public meeting. In fact, Chairman Regnier testified that \u201cfor something to happen with Llew Jones, it required my vote ... but I wasn\u2019t going to make a decision on this until we actually had our meeting and had a discussion about it.\u201d We conclude that the Commissioners\u2019 one-on-one discussions prior to the February 12 meeting were not subject to Section 9 because amajority of Commission members never \u201cconvened\u201d or \u201cdeliberated\u201d as a \u201cpublic body\u201d outside of a public meeting. Thus, the District Court did not err in concluding that the Commission did not violate the public\u2019s \u201cright to know.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b376-5\">\u00b626 <em>2. Did the District Court err in concluding that the Commission did not violate the public\u2019s right of participation?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b376-6\">\u00b627 As stated above, Section 8 applies more narrowly than Section 9. Section 8 applies only to \u201cgovernmental agencies.\u201d Mont. Const, art. II, \u00a7 8; Section 2-3-101, MCA. The Legislature has defined an agency as \u201cany board, bureau, commission, department, authority, or officer of the state or local government authorized by law to make rules, determine contested cases, or enter into contracts,\u201d excluding \u201cthe legislature and any branch, committee, or officer thereof.\u201d Section 2-3-102(l)(a), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-7\">\u00b628 Plaintiffs allege Section 8 applies to the Commission because the Commission is a \u201cseparate body\u201d and is not a \u201cbranch\u201d or \u201ccommittee\u201d of the Legislature. Plaintiffs argue the Commission violated the public\u2019s right to participate by failing to post any proposed holdover amendments on the Commission\u2019s website, failing to provide the public with \u201csufficient factual detail and rationale\u201d for the Jones Amendment, and effectively denying the public the right to submit written <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>comments on the amendment. The State counters that the Commission is not a governmental agency but is a part of the legislative branch of government because \u201cit legislates directly by passing [and submitting] a final plan for legislative districts\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted). The State points out that the provisions relating to the Commission are placed within Article V of the Montana Constitution (titled \u201cThe Legislature\u201d). According to the State, \u201c[r]egardless of where exactly the Commission fits within the legislature, it is clearly part of\u2018the legislature.\u2019 \u201d In the alternative, the State argues that even if the participation statutes did apply to the Commission, the Commission provided sufficient notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-4\">\u00b629 As the District Cotut noted, \u201c[although the Commission is independent from the legislature, it is clearly a part of the legislative branch of government\u201d for several reasons, including that: its powers and duties are established under Article V of the Montana Constitution; the Commission operates much like an interim legislative committee; and the Legislative Services Division provides the research analysts, attorney, and secretary to staff the Commission and to maintain its website, which is found on the \u201cLegislative Branch\u201d homepage. In <em>Wheat v. Brown, </em>2004 MT 33, 320 Mont. 15, 85 P.3d 765, we determined that the 1972 Constitutional Convention \u201cassigned the task of redistricting to the Commission \u2014 an independent, autonomous entity \u2014 and limited the Legislature\u2019s role to that of making \u2018recommendations.\u2019 \u201d <em>Wheat, </em>\u00b6 23. It does not follow that the Commission is wholly outside of the legislative branch of government. We also note that prior to the enactment of the 1972 Constitution, redistricting was a function of the Legislature. Under the new constitution, it is incumbent upon the Legislature to select four of the five Commissioners. Moreover, the Commission does not merely implement or administer existing law; it actually makes law, as does the Legislature. Finally, we note that the Commission is not \u201cauthorized by law to make rules, determine contested cases, or enter into contracts,\u201d which is the role of an \u201cagency\u201d as defined in \u00a7 2-3-102(1), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-5\">\u00b630  Thus, we conclude that the Commission is not a \u201cgovernmental agency\u201d and is therefore not subject to the requirements of Section 8. We note, however, that even though the Commission was exempt from the participation statutes, the Commission maximized public participation by holding multiple public meetings and by allowing the public to actively engage in the redistricting process. The District Court did not err in determining that the Commission is part of the legislative branch and is not an \u201cagency,\u201d and that it is therefore <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>exempt from the statutes promulgating the right of participation.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-4\">\u00b631 <em>3. Did the District Court err in concluding that the Commission did not violate Plaintiffs\u2019 right of suffrage?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b378-5\">\u00b632 Section 13 provides: \u201cAll elections shall be free and open, and no power, civil or military, shall at any time interfere to prevent the free exercise of the right of suffrage.\u201d Mont. Const, art. n, \u00a7 13. The right of suffrage is a fundamental right. <em>See e.g. State v. Riggs, </em>2005 MT 124, \u00b6 47, 327 Mont. 196, 113 P.3d 281 (citations omitted) (\u201cA right is \u2018fundamental\u2019 under Montana\u2019s Constitution if the right either is found in the Declaration of Eights or is a right \u2018without which other constitutionally guaranteed rights would have little meaning.\u2019 \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b378-6\">\u00b633 Plaintiffs contend that their right of suffrage was violated because 95% of Senate District 15\u2019s population will have to wait six years between senate elections. Defendants counter that Plaintiffs\u2019 allegation is not supported by state or federal law, and that in the context of redistricting, the primary concern is with keeping the deviation in population as close to the \u201cideal deviation\u201d of one person, one vote as possible.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b378-7\">\u00b634  The District Court stated that \u201c[i]t is an inescapable consequence of the redistricting process that many Montanans will cast their votes in two senate (general) elections over a ten year period,\u201d and noted that \u201cthere are no statutes or case law requiring [the Commission] to minimize the affected population.\u201d We agree that the shuffling of legislators is a necessary byproduct of the redistricting process when senators serve staggered four-year terms, and voters in 25 districts will inevitably be assigned a \u201choldover senator\u201d and vote for only two senators in ten years. We note that Plaintiffs\u2019 requested remedy of striking the Jones Amendment would result in voters from another district voting in only two senate elections over the ten-year period. Thus, the purported violation of the right of suffrage would not be cured at all; it would simply be shifted to another set of voters. The District Court did not err in concluding that Plaintiffs\u2019 suffrage argument is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-8\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b378-9\">\u00b635  For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the District Court\u2019s order granting the State\u2019s motion for summary judgment and denying <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>Plaintiffs\u2019 motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<judges id=\"b379-4\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES WHEAT, BAKER, McKINNON and RICE concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b371-12\"> House candidates run for election every two years, and Senate candidates run every four years.

The Plaintiffs\u2019 complaint asked the District Court to declare \u201cthat the Commission\u2019s reassignment on February 12,2013, of Senator Ripley to SD-10 and Senator Hamlett to SD-15 in accordance with the Llew Jones Motion was unlawful.\u201d The State did not raise an argument about the propriety of the relief sought and neither party discussed the court\u2019s authority to strike a single amendment from the Commission\u2019s final plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-7\">\u00b637 Article V, Section 14 of the Montana Constitution vests the Commission with the power to redistxict and reapportion the state into legislative districts. Following the filing of the Commission\u2019s final plan with the Secretary of State, the plan becomes law and the Commission is dissolved. Mont. Const, art. V, \u00a7 14(3). The Plaintiffs have cited no authority for the proposition that this Court could strike a single amendment made by the Commission in the development of a comprehensive redistricting plan that has become law and the whole of which is not alleged to violate the constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-8\">\u00b638 \u201c[Legislative reapportionment is primarily a matter for legislative consideration and determination....\u201d <em>Reynolds v. Sims, </em>377 U.S. 533, 586, 84 S. Ct. 1362, 1394, 12 L. Ed. 2d 506 (1964). Without the issue having been raised or briefed by the parties, there is no basis for the Court to address it; but today\u2019s opinion should not be taken as a determination that a party may seek relief from one amendment made during the Commission\u2019s process of adopting a final redistricting plan.</p>\n<author id=\"b379-9\">JUSTICE McKINNON,</author>\n<p id=\"AWuV\">concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-10\">\u00b639 I concur in the Court\u2019s Opinion. I believe, however, that the Court\u2019s citation to and discussion of <em>Boulder Monitor v. Jefferson High School District No. 1, </em>2014 MT 5, 373 Mont. 212, 316 P.3d 848, are unnecessary. In my view, <em>Boulder Monitor </em>is factually distinguishable from our resolution of the present case. Moreover, I continue to disagree with the Court\u2019s analysis and conclusions in <em>Boulder Monitor </em>for the reasons stated in my dissent in that case. <em>See Boulder Monitor, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 24-39 (McKinnon, J., dissenting). Thus, aside from the citations to <em>Boulder Monitor, </em>I otherwise agree with the Court\u2019s decision.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
