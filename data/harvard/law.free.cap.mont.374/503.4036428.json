R. Civ. P. 11 (Rule 11). We reverse and remand for further proceedings consistent with this Opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-25\">ISSUES</p>\n<p id=\"b529-26\">\u00b62 Davenport\u2019s appeal raises twenty-four issues, which are either <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>without merit or unintelligible. From these, we have distilled the relevant issues to two:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b530-5\">\n<em>1. Should we review Davenport\u2019s claims of error related to the imposition of Rule 11 sanctions, when the Order sanctioning her was set in place two years ago and Davenport had the opportunity to challenge the Rule 11 sanctions in her direct appeal?</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b530-6\">\n<em>2. Did the District Court abuse its discretion when it issued its Amended Order Imposing Rule 11 Sanctions on April 1, 2013?</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b530-7\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b530-8\">\u00b63 The present appeal has a history stretching back five years, which we have now twice described as \u201cmind-numbing.\u201d Nonetheless, we revisit that history in an attempt to provide context for the current appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-9\">\u00b64 On September 8,2009, Davenport filed an Application for Writ of Mandate with the Missoula County District Court, seeking to disqualify Justice of the Peace John Odlin for cause from presiding in two misdemeanor cases against Davenport. One of these actions involved two counts of maintaining community decay related to \u201choarding\u201d on Davenport\u2019s Missoula properties and the other was for a speeding ticket.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-10\">\u00b65 The District Court entered a stay of proceedings and assigned Justice of the Peace Jim Bailey of Ravalli County to conduct a hearing and make a determination as to Judge Odlin\u2019s ability to sit as a neutral magistrate. On November 3,2009, Justice of the Peace Bailey sent the District Court a letter stating he was canceling the scheduled disqualification hearing due to Davenport\u2019s \u201cadamant refusal\u201d to comply with his Orders. The District Court denied Davenport\u2019s motion to disqualify Justice of the Peace Odlin on November 6, 2009, cautioning Davenport that \u201cany further frivolous action on her part will be met with severe sanctions from the Court involved.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b530-11\">\u00b66 Following that Order, Davenport filed a flurry of motions and briefs. On February 1, 2010, following a hearing, the District Court issued an Opinion and Order, again denying Davenport\u2019s motion for disqualification of Justice of the Peace Odlin. In that Order, the District Court advised: \u201cKristine Davenport moved to disqualify Judge Odlin because of bias because he ruled against her. The clear remedy with dissatisfaction of lower court proceedings is to appeal the decision or verdict, rather than attempting to disqualify the judge.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b530-12\">\u00b67 Davenport moved for Summary Judgment \u201cRe Attorney-Client Relationship between Judge and Prosecutor\u201d and filed an \u201cApplication <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>for Writ of Prohibition.\u201d On April 14,2011, the District Court issued a strongly-worded Order denying both of these requests, granting Justice of the Peace Odlin personal jurisdiction over Davenport, and ordering that Davenport appear at a hearing to show cause why she should not be sanctioned pursuant to Rule 11. Following that hearing, the District Court issued an Order on May 5, 2011, preventing Davenport from filing farther motions or briefs with the court; denying several motions she had filed; holding Davenport in contempt; ordering her to pay sanctions in the amount of $2500.00; and providing that Davenport\u2019s failure to pay the sanctions would result in her incarceration. The Court also concluded that Davenport was in violation of Ride 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-5\">\u00b68 Davenport applied for a Writ of Certiorari with this Court. On June 28, 2011, we issued an Order vacating the parts of the District Court\u2019s Order holding Davenport in contempt and imposing a fine or incarceration related to the contempt finding. We denied Davenport\u2019s Writ with respect to the Rule 11 sanctions, concluding Davenport had a plain, speedy and adequate remedy of appeal. Consistent with our Order, the District Court amended its Order holding Davenport in contempt to strike any reference to contempt. The Amended Order, dated August 23, 2011, imposed Ride 11 sanctions and ordered Davenport to pay $2,500.00 within thirty days. Davenport appealed to this Court, stating she was \u201c \u2018simply appealing the court\u2019s refusal to disqualify Odlin pursuant to her affidavit[s] of disqualification.\u2019 \u201d <em>Davenport v. Odlin, </em>2011 MT 327 N, \u00b6 6, 363 Mont. 417. Because she did not appeal the Rule 11 sanctions, we did not address that issue. <em>Davenport, </em>\u00b6 6. In a memorandum opinion, we held that Davenport\u2019s affidavits did not comply with the good faith requirement in \u00a7 3-1-805(l)(b), MCA, and that her \u201cfrivolous and dilatory\u201d arguments failed here, just as they had failed in the District Court. <em>Davenport, </em>\u00b6 8. Following that Opinion, the District Court, on April 1, 2013, again amended its Order to reinstate the provisions imposing jail time on Davenport should she fail to pay the $2,500.00 Rule 11 sanctions within thirty days. Davenport now appeals, protesting the Rule 11 sanctions.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-6\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b531-7\">\u00b69 Our standard of review of a district court\u2019s decision to grant or deny sanctions under Rule 11 is the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b531-8\">[W]e review de novo the district court\u2019s determination that the pleading, motion or other paper violates Rule 11. We review the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>district court\u2019s findings of fact underlying that conclusion to determine whether such findings are clearly erroneous. If the court determines that Rule 11 was violated, then we review the district court\u2019s choice of sanction for abuse of discretion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b532-4\"><em>Byrum v. Andren, </em>2007 MT 107, \u00b6 19, 337 Mont. 167, 159 P.3d 1062. A district court retains the necessary flexibility to deal appropriately with violations of Rule 11 and has discretion to tailor sanctions to the particular facts of the case. <em>Gold Reserve Corp. v. McCarty, </em>228 Mont. 512, 515, 744 P.2d 160, 162 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b532-5\">\u00b610 A court abuses its discretion if it makes a ruling arbitrarily, unreasonably, or without employing conscientious judgment, which results in substantial injustice. <em>State v. Hart, </em>2009 MT 268, \u00b6 9, 352 Mont. 92,214 P.3d 1273.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b532-7\">\u00b611 <em>1. Should we review Davenport\u2019s claims of error related to the imposition of Rule 11 sanctions, when the Order sanctioning her was set in place two years ago and Davenport had the opportunity to challenge the Rule 11 sanctions in her direct appeal?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b532-8\">\u00b612 Rule 4 of the Montana Rules of Appellate Procedure requires that, in civil cases, a notice of appeal must be filed within thirty days from the date of entry of the judgment or order from which appeal is taken. M. R. App. P. 4(5)(a)(i). In <em>McCormick v. Brevig, </em>2007 MT 195, \u00b6 38, 338 Mont. 370, 169 P.3d 352, we explained that the law of the case doctrine provides that a \u201clegal decision made at one stage of litigation which is not appealed when the opportunity to do so exists, becomes the law of the case for the future course of that litigation and the party that does not appeal is deemed to have waived the right to attack that decision at future points in the same litigation.\u201d (Citations omitted.) While the law of the case doctrine does not limit this Court\u2019s power to reopen what has been decided where circumstances require it, the strong policy favoring finality begs that a court exercise its power to review earlier rulings sparingly. <em>See North River Ins. Co. v. Philadelphia Reinsurance Corp., </em>63 F.3d 160, 164 (2d Cir. 1995) (\u201c[T]he law of the case doctrine does not limit the power of a court, but merely expresses the practice of courts generally to refuse to reopen what has been decided.\u201d) (Internal quotations omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b532-9\">\u00b613 Here, Davenport had the opportunity to appeal the Rule 11 sanctions in the direct appeal we resolved in 2011. While we are not barred from considering the issues she raises now, we conclude that the policy favoring finality, along with the time limitations set forth in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>the Montana Rules of Appellate Procedure, weigh against considering them. We will not further address Davenport\u2019s arguments on the Ride 11 sanctions. Thus, the real issue in this appeal is whether the District Court properly issued its 2013 Order.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-5\">\u00b614 <em>2. Did the District Court abuse its discretion in issuing its Amended Order Imposing Rule 11 Sanctions on April 1, 2013?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b533-6\">\u00b615 Rule 60(a), M. R. Civ. P., grants district courts the power to correct clerical errors in judgments at any time, since correction of such errors does not alter the substantive rights of the parties. <em>Thomas v. Thomas, </em>189 Mont. 547, 550, 617 P.2d 133, 135 (1980); <em>see </em>M. R. Civ. P. 60(a). Conversely, the Rules of Civil Procedure impose procedural and time restraints on a district court\u2019s powers to alter \u201cjudicial errors,\u201d which affect the substantive rights of the parties. <em>Thomas, </em>189 Mont. at 550, 617 P.2d at 135. As we explained in <em>Thomas:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b533-7\">[A] court cannot amend its record to correct a judicial error or to remedy the effect of judicial nonaction.... The authority of a court to amend its record by a nunc pro tunc order is to make it speak the truth, but not to make it speak what it did not speak but ought to have spoken....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b533-8\">(Citations and quotations omitted.) Where an error is not clerical, but judicial, a court lacks jurisdiction to amend its order outside of the time limitations and process prescribed by the Rules of Civil Procedure. <em>Thomas, </em>189 Mont. at 550, 617 P.2d at 135.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-9\">\u00b616 In the District Court\u2019s May 5, 2011, Order imposing Rule 11 sanctions on Davenport, the District Court also held Davenport in contempt, imposed sanctions related to that contempt and threatened her with jail time if she failed to pay the sanctions within thirty days. In our June 28, 2011, Order responding to Davenport\u2019s Writ of Certiorari, we vacated the contempt finding and related sanctions and jail time. We also explained that the Rule 11 sanctions were subject to the normal appeal process. In response, on August 23, 2011, the District Court amended its Order to strike any reference to contempt and jail time, and to impose the original amount of sanctions, instead, related to the Rule 11 violation. Davenport failed to timely appeal from that Order and this matter should have ended there. Instead, a year and a half after our 2011 decision affirming the District Court\u2019s denial of Davenport\u2019s request to disqualify Odlin \u2014 in which we expressly declined to address the Rule 11 issue \u2014 the District Court again amended its Order imposing Rule 11 sanctions. The record before us does not reveal the purpose for the District Court\u2019s amendment. On this record, we conclude that the District Court incorrectly amended <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>its Order a year and a half after this matter should have terminated.</p>\n<p id=\"AWv\">\u00b617  As we held in <em>Thomas, </em>Rule 60(a) only permits a district court to correct clerical mistakes and oversights in the record; not to alter the record in a way that affects the substantive rights of the parties. A substantive right is \u201c[a] right that can be protected or enforced by law; a right of substance rather than form.\u201d <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>1349 (Bryan A. Gamer ed., 8th ed., West 2004). The fundamental liberty interest is a substantive right. <em>See </em>Mont. Const, art. II, \u00a7 3. The District Court\u2019s amendment to its Order, providing that Davenport faces jail time should she fail to pay the $2,500.00 sanctions within thirty days cannot be construed as a mere correction of a clerical error because it impacts her liberty interest. Rather, it appears to be an effort to make the Order \u201cspeak what it did not speak but ought to have spoken.\u201d If the District Court incorrectly omitted the provisions of its original Order threatening jail time for failure to timely pay the sanctions, that error was judicial and not merely clerical, absent some sort of factual showing to the contrary. Because the amendment to the Order was not clerical, the District Court was jurisdictionally barred from amending the Order. The District Court abused its discretion when it amended the Order to correct a judicial error, a year and a half after this matter should have been settled.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-5\">\u00b618 Where a District Court lacks jurisdiction to amend an Order, the Amended Order must be set aside and the previous Order reinstated. <em>See Thomas, </em>189 Mont. at 552, 617 P.2d at 136. We therefore conclude that the District Court\u2019s April 1, 2013, Order must be set aside and its August 23,2011, Amended Order reinstated.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-6\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b534-7\">\u00b619 Reversed and remanded for proceedings consistent with this Opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b534-8\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES COTTER, BAKER and McKINNON concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b534-9\">JUSTICE McKINNON,</author>\n<p id=\"AYE\">concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-10\">\u00b620 These proceedings have been time consuming and torturous for the District Court. While I agree that the 2013 Amended Order must be reversed because it affected the substantive rights of Davenport by imposing jail time without proper procedure, the District Court must have a means by which to effectuate its orders. In this instance, Davenport has gone two years without paying the fine imposed by the District Court. Clearly the District Court must address Davenport\u2019s noncompliance. However, there are procedures, such as an order to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>show cause and a hearing, which are available for the District Court when a parly refuses to follow a court order. While Davenport has had two appeals to this Court and innumerable hearings before and review from the District Court, the record does not indicate that Davenport was given notice and opportunity to be heard prior to the imposition of the 2013 Amended Order. As the 2013 Amended Order imposed a new condition which substantively affected Davenport\u2019s liberty interests, she should have been given an opportunity to address imposition of the new condition before the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-5\">\u00b621 I therefore concur in the decision of the Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
