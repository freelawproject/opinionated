The sole issue raised on appeal is whether the District Court properly granted the Anackers\u2019 motion for summaiy judgment on the basis that the recording of a previous judgment discharged Sudan Drilling\u2019s construction lien and rendered Sudan\u2019s claims moot, even though this Court reversed and remanded the previous judgment. We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-5\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b299-6\">\u00b62 Sudan filed a complaint against the Anackers on April 25,2005, seeking to foreclose on a construction hen. Sudan alleged that the Anackers owed $3,970 for the digging of the first of two domestic water wells on the Anackers\u2019 property. Both parties filed motions for summary judgment. On November 16,2007, the District Court entered an order granting the Anackers\u2019 motion on the grounds that Sudan never completed the first well and that Sudan breached its contract with the Anackers to drill the well in a workmanlike manner because it drilled in the wrong location.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-7\">\u00b63 The District Court\u2019s December 5, 2007 judgment directed the Clerk and Recorder of Flathead County to remove Sudan\u2019s lien from the public record. The Anackers recorded the judgment with the clerk and recorder\u2019s office. Sudan thereafter appealed. Sudan did not post a supersedeas bond, move to stay the execution of the judgment, or move to reinstate the lien. This Court reversed the judgment and remanded the case to the District Court, holding that the undisputed fact that the well was not completed was insufficient to invalidate the construction lien and that genuine issues of material fact precluded summary judgment because the parties presented conflicting testimony concerning responsibility for the well\u2019s misplacement. <em>Sudan Drilling, </em>Inc. <em>v. Anacker, </em>2009 MT 14, \u00b6 17, 349 Mont. 42, 202 P.3d 778. Sudan then recorded a lis pendens on the Anackers\u2019 real property to provide notice of this Court\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-8\">\u00b64 After this Court remanded the case, Clarice Anacker deposited a $5,955 check as a bond with the Clerk of Court. The deputy clerk filed a letter stating that the bond \u201cwill release said hen\u201d from the property pursuant to \u00a7 71-3-551, MCA, despite that the bond was not filed within thirty days of Sudan\u2019s action to foreclose the hen as required by the statute. The letter referenced the number of the hs pendens, but only referred directly to the hen. The parties do not dispute that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>clerk of court lacked the legal authority to release the lis pendens in this manner. The lien has not been removed and is still of record. Nonetheless, the Anackers were able to close on a pending $154,000 refinancing loan after the deputy clerk filed the letter of release. Sudan later recorded a subordination agreement, expressly subordinating the position of its hen to the deed of trust securing the Anackers\u2019 loan.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-5\">\u00b65 On remand, the Anackers once again sought summary judgment \u2014 this time arguing that the hen was unenforceable because the recording of the District Court\u2019s prior judgment effectively discharged and released the hen, even though this Court reversed the judgment on appeal. The District Court granted the Anackers\u2019 motion. Sudan appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-6\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b300-7\">\u00b66 This Court reviews appeals from summary judgment rulings de novo, applying the standards set forth in M. R. Civ. P. 56(c). <em>Mt. W. Bank, N.A. v. Cherrad, LLC, </em>2013 MT 99, \u00b6 25, 369 Mont. 492, 301 P.3d 796. Summary judgment is appropriate where \u201cthe pleadings, the discovery and disclosure materials on file, and any affidavits show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d M. R. Civ. P. 56(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b300-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b300-9\">\u00b67 <em>Whether the District Court\u2019s previous judgment discharged Sudan Drilling\u2019s construction lien, thus rendering Sudan\u2019s claims moot.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b300-10\">\u00b68 The judicial power of Montana courts is limited to justiciable controversies that may be resolved by the courts. Mootness is one of several central concepts ofjusticiabihty. \u201c[I]f the issue presented at the outset of the action has ceased to exist or is no longer \u2018live,\u2019 or if the court is unable due to an intervening event or change in circumstances to grant effective relief or to restore the parties to their original position, then the issue before the court is moot.\u201d <em>Greater Missoula Area Fedn. of Early Childhood Educators v. Child Start, </em>Inc., 2009 MT 362, \u00b6 23, 353 Mont. 201, 219 P.3d 881. \u201c[Cjourts lack jurisdiction to decide moot issues insofar as an actual \u2018case or controversy\u2019 no longer exists.\u201d <em>Child Start, </em>\u00b6 23. \u201cIn deciding whether a matter is moot, we determine whether the court can grant effective appellate relief.\u201d <em>Mt. W. Bank, </em>\u00b6 30.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-11\">\u00b69 This Court has remarked that \u201c[t]here is no reason why this Court cannot grant effective relief\u201d in a case where \u201c[n]o property changed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>hands pursuant to the judgment nor are there third party interests involved.\u201d <em>Martin Dev. Co. v. Keeney Constr. Co., </em>216 Mont. 212, 220, 703 P.2d 143, 148 (1985). <em>Martin Dev. Co. </em>involved an action for breach of a construction contract. The district court issued a final judgment awarding the plaintiff $72,000 in damages and ordered that the defendant satisfy the judgment from a rent impoundment account administered by a title company. <em>Martin Dev. Co., </em>216 Mont. at 215, 703 P.2d at 145. The defendant did not take any action to stay execution of the judgment, but appealed the district court\u2019s order. The plaintiff asked this Court to dismiss the appeal because the judgment had been satisfied. We declined to do so, holding that the case was not moot because there had been no change of position that would make it impossible for this Court to grant effective relief. <em>Martin Dev. Co., </em>216 Mont. at 220, 703 P.2d at 148.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-4\">\u00b610 In contrast, we have held that effective relief could not be fashioned where the underlying property was sold to a third party during the pendency of the appeal. <em>E.g. Mt. </em>W. <em>Bank, </em>\u00b6 33; <em>Turner v. Mt. Engg. &amp; Constr., </em>276 Mont. 55, 63-64, 915 P.2d 799, 804-05 (1996); <em>Graveyard Creek Ranch, Inc. v. Bell, </em>2005 MT 172, \u00b6\u00b6 13-15, 327 Mont. 491, 116 P.3d 779. In Mf. W. <em>Bank, </em>for example, a district court entered an order that invalidated a construction lien. The party possessing the lien failed to take any action to stay the order or prevent the sale of the property. We noted that, \u201c[although a party is not required to seek a stay of execution, a party choosing not to seek such a stay runs the risk of having the appeal become moot.\u201d <em>Mt. W. Bank, </em>\u00b6 32; <em>accord Turner, </em>276 Mont. at 63, 915 P.2d at 804. We warned of the \u201cparticular danger of dismissal for mootness where the sale of property to a third party is involved.\u201d <em>Mt. W. Bank, </em>\u00b6 32 (quotation omitted). We held that even if the district court incorrectly determined the invalidity of the construction hen, the sale of the units named in the construction hen to third-party purchasers in good faith rendered moot the claim regarding the validity of the hen. <em>Mt. W. Bank, </em>\u00b6 33.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-5\">\u00b611 We have rejected a categorical rule that the satisfaction of a judgment renders an appeal moot. <em>Progressive Direct Ins. Co. v. Stuivenga, </em>2012 MT 75, \u00b6\u00b6 43-44, 364 Mont. 390, 276 P.3d 867. In <em>Stuivenga, </em>the defendant argued that it was impossible for this Court to grant rehef because the appellant did not post a supersedeas bond or stay the disbursement of interpleaded funds, and the funds had been paid to third parties. <em>Stuivenga, </em>\u00b6 41. We rejected this claim, noting that if a party cannot be restored to its original pre-judgment position, other possibilities such as restitution may be appropriate. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number><em>Stuivenga, </em>\u00b6 41. The Anackers maintain in like fashion that, although this Court reversed the previous judgment, Sudan\u2019s failure to stay the execution of the judgment, post a supersedeas bond, or reinstate the lien rendered Sudan\u2019s claims moot. As we explained in <em>Stuivenga, </em>however, an appellant is not required to seek a stay of execution or post a supersedeas bond in order to preserve its claims for appeal. <em>Stuivenga, </em>\u00b6 45. Whether a case has become moot will depend on the relief sought and the specific factual and procedural circumstances of the particular case. <em>Stuivenga, </em>\u00b6 43. Failure to take precautionary measures, on its own, does not render a party\u2019s claims moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-4\">\u00b612 Precautions certainly would be advisable: a stay of the execution of the judgment would have served to put third parties on notice that Sudan\u2019s appeal was pending and protected Sudan\u2019s hen from becoming unenforceable upon sale of the land to an innocent third party. Sudan bore the considerable risk that the property could have been sold to a third-party purchaser in good faith as happened in <em>Mt. W. Bank. </em>The distinguishing factor in this case is that the Anackers\u2019 property was not sold. The risk never was realized because the Anackers remained at all times in possession of the property that is subject to Sudan\u2019s hen.</p>\n<p id=\"AOD\">\u00b613 In effect, the Anackers argue that although this Court reversed the District Court\u2019s judgment, the judgment nonetheless remained in effect, and it is now too late for effective rehef. It is an estabhshed principle, however, that all proceedings taken under a judgment are dependent for their validity upon the judgment being sustained. <em>Stuivenga, </em>\u00b6 22. Once the judgment of a district court has been reversed, that judgment no longer has any effect. This Court has stated, \u201c[W]hen the judgment is reversed, it is then a nullity, and the matter stands as if no judgment had ever been rendered.\u201d <em>Anderson v. Border, </em>87 Mont. 4, 11, 285 P. 174, 177 (1930); <em>C. Mont. Stockyards v. Fraser, </em>133 Mont. 168, 186, 320 P.2d 981, 991 (1957) (\u201cTo reverse a judgment or order means to overthrow it by a contrary decision, to make it void. When a judgment or order is reversed it is as if never rendered or made.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b302-5\">\u00b614  This fundamental rule remains true even if a judgment properly has been recorded prior to its reversal. Once this Court reversed, the previous judgment was rendered a nullity \u2014 as though it never had been entered \u2014 and could not release the Anackers\u2019 real property from Sudan\u2019s hen. The land has not been sold to a third-party, the risk Sudan faced has not been realized, and the lien still exists on the property. Although the hen is in second position to the deed of trust, Sudan still may litigate its validity.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>\u00b615 Finally, as the District Court disposed of Sudan\u2019s additional claims for abuse of process and for property damage primarily on the basis of its ruling on the lien foreclosure claim, we remand for further consideration of these claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b303-6\">\u00b616 We reverse and remand for proceedings consistent with this opinion. Based on our determination of error, we vacate the District Court\u2019s award of fees and costs to the Anackers.</p>\n<judges id=\"b303-7\">JUSTICES McKINNON, COTTER, WHEAT and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
