The State later moved to amend the Information to add a criminal endangerment charge pursuant \u00a7 45-5-207(1), MCA Before trial, Zink moved to dismiss the endangerment charge as a lesser-included offense of aggravated assault. The District Court denied that motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-8\">\u00b62 At trial, the State presented testimony from Zink\u2019s wife, Elizabeth Zink (Elizabeth). Elizabeth testified that she was in the midst of bathing one of her children when Zink called her into the hallway, \u201cgrabbed me and threw me into the wall and held me up against the wall by my wrists,\u201d then \u201cshoved me into the floor\u201d and \u201chit me on my back.\u201d Elizabeth got up and went to the kitchen, where Zink \u201ccame at me with both hands, and he squeezed hard right away, he squeezed really hard.\u201d Elizabeth heard a \u201ccrunching gurgle\u201d come from her neck, followed by Zink squeezing harder and telling her to die. \u201cI thought, God, is this really going to happen, am I really going to die?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b129-9\">\u00b63 The District Court instructed the jury on criminal endangerment, aggravated assault, and assault as a lesser-included offense of aggravated assault. The jury convicted Zink on the criminal endangerment count and the lesser offense of assault.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-10\">\u00b64 At sentencing, Mr. Hinchey (Hinchey), Zink\u2019s counsel, argued for a probationary sentence on the grounds that Zink was not convicted on aggravated assault, a violent felony. Hinchey repeatedly emphasized that the jury chose the lesser offense, and thus found that Elizabeth did not suffer reasonable apprehension of serious bodily \u00faajury. Hinchey also referred to Zink\u2019s testimony to show that he was a loving father and that Elizabeth and her children were not in danger from Zink upon his release. Hinchey did not invoke \u00a7 46-18-225, MCA, which requires a sentencing court to evaluate specific criteria when assessing imprisonment alternatives for non-violent offenders. The State argued for imprisonment in Montana State Prison based on Zink\u2019s past convictions for partner assault, the severity of the assault, and his attempt to justify and minimize the assault. The District Court sentenced Zink to ten years on the criminal endangerment count and a concurrent six months on the assault count.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>\u00b65 Zink appeals from the District Court\u2019s order, arguing that criminal endangerment is a lesser-included offense of aggravated assault and thus charging both crimes is prohibited by statute. Zink also argues that he received ineffective assistance of counsel when Hinchey failed to invoke \u00a7 46-18-225, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-4\">\u00b66 The following issues are presented for review:</p>\n<p id=\"b130-5\">\u00b67 <em>Did the District Court err in denying Zink\u2019s pre-trial motion to dismiss the charge of criminal endangerment as a lesser-included offense of aggravated assault?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b130-6\">\u00b68 <em>Did Zink receive ineffective assistance of counsel when his attorney failed to raise the statutory criteria for alternatives to imprisonment for sentencing non-violent offenders?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b130-7\">STANDARDS OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b130-8\">\u00b69 The denial of a motion to dismiss in a criminal case is a conclusion of law which we review de novo. <em>State v. Dixon, </em>2000 MT 82, \u00b6 10, 299 Mont. 165, 998 P.2d 544 (citing <em>State v. Weaver, </em>1998 MT 167, \u00b6 43, 290 Mont. 58, 964 P.2d 713). Ineffective assistance of counsel (IAC) claims present mixed questions of law and fact that we review de novo. <em>State v. Gunderson, </em>2010 MT 166, \u00b6 66, 357 Mont. 142, 237 P.3d 74.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-9\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b130-10\">\u00b610 <em>Did the District Court err in denying Zink\u2019s pre-trial motion to dismiss the charge of criminal endangerment as a lesser-included offense of aggravated assault?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b130-11\">\u00b611 Zink invokes Montana\u2019s statutory prohibition on multiple convictions as well as the federal prohibition of multiplicitous charges under the Double Jeopardy Clause. Under both protections, Zink argues that criminal endangerment is a lesser-included offense of aggravated assault.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-12\">A Statutory Prohibition on Multiple Convictions</p>\n<p id=\"AgU\">\u00b612 Zink contends that criminal endangerment is a lesser-included offense of aggravated assault, and thus the State may not charge him with both. Zink cites to <em>State v. Tellegen, </em>2013 MT 337, \u00b6 23, 372 Mont. 454, 314 P.3d 902 for the proposition that a defendant may not be charged with both a greater and lesser offense.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> That case concerned <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>a defendant\u2019s <em>conviction </em>on both a lesser and greater offense, which is prohibited under \u00a7 46-ll-410(2)(a), MCA <em>Tellegen, </em>\u00b6 26. The same statute specifically provides that, \u201c[w]hen the same transaction may establish the commission of more than one offense, a person charged with the conduct may be prosecuted for each offense.\u201d Section 46-11-410(1), MCA. Montana law also specifically authorizes charging in the alternative. Section 46-11-404(3), MCA (\u201cThe prosecution is not required to elect between the different offenses set forth in the charging document, and the defendant may be convicted of any number of the offenses charged except as provided in 46-11-410.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"AFS\">\u00b613  Even if criminal endangerment is a lesser-included offense of aggravated assault, Zink was not convicted on both charges, so \u00a7 46-11-410, MCA, is not implicated. The jury convicted Zink on criminal endangerment and misdemeanor assault instead of aggravated assault. Zink does not argue that simple assault and criminal endangerment are lesser or included in one another. Rather, he argues that because the criminal endangerment charge is a lesser-included offense of aggravated assault, the endangerment charge should have been dismissed at the outset and he should not have been tried on both counts. As expressly stated in the statute, however, a defendant may be charged in the alternative, so long as he is convicted of only one offense. Section 46-11-410, MCA. Montana\u2019s statutoiy prohibition on multiple convictions was not violated, so we need not address whether criminal endangerment is a lesser-included offense of aggravated assault.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-4\">B. Multiplicity of Charges</p>\n<p id=\"b131-5\">\u00b614 Zink also argues that the charges here were multiplicitous because they address one crime with multiple charges. As discussed above, Montana law specifically allows charging in the alternative, and prohibits only convictions on multiplicitous charges. Sections 46-11-404(3), 410, MCA. Instead, Zink cites to federal law for the proposition that \u201c[ujnless each offense requires proof of an element that the other does not, a defendant may not be charged with both.\u201d <em>U.S. v. Woerner, </em>709 F.3d 527, 539 (5th Cir. 2013) (citations omitted). \u00b615 Federal jurisprudence, however, only protects a defendant from conviction on multiplicitous charges. \u201c[A] defendant has no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>constitutional right to elect which of two applicable federal statutes shall be the basis of his indictment and prosecution,\u201d <em>United States v. Batchelder, </em>442 U.S. 114, 125, 99 S. Ct. 2198, 2205 (1979), nor does the Double Jeopardy Clause act as a \u201cbar to the Government\u2019s proceeding with prosecution simultaneously under the two statutes.\u201d <em>Ball v. United States, </em>470 U.S. 856, 860, 105 S. Ct. 1668, 1671 (1985). The reason for concern with multiplicity of charges is that it creates the <em>potential </em>for multiple punishments or convictions in violation of the Double Jeopardy Clause. <em>State v. Robbins, </em>32 P.3d 171, 182 (Kan. 2001). Thus, courts may cure any double jeopardy problems with multiplicitous indictments by vacating those convictions that are multiplicitous. <em>See United States v. Kerley, </em>544 F.3d 172, 179 (2d Cir. 2008); <em>United States v. Ehle, </em>640 F.3d 689, 699 (6th Cir. 2011); <em>United States v. Lynn, </em>636 F.3d 1127, 1139 (9th Cir. 2011); <em>United States v. Bonilla, </em>579 F.3d 1233, 1246 (11th Cir. 2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b132-4\">\u00b616  Zink was not subjected to multiple convictions or punishments, so he was not placed in jeopardy by the allegedly multiplicitous charges. Even ifZink had been convicted on multiplicitous charges, the District Court could have cured that problem by vacating the offending conviction. Accordingly, Zink\u2019s double jeopardy claim is without merit, and we need not address whether criminal endangerment is a lesser-included offense of aggravated assault.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-5\">\u00b6 17 <em>Did Zink receive ineffective assistance of counsel when his attorney failed to raise the statutory criteria for alternatives to imprisonment for sentencing non-violent offenders?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b132-6\">\u00b618 To determine whether an individual has received ineffective assistance of counsel, we use the two-part test set forth in <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 687, 104 S. Ct. 2052, 2064 (1984). Under this test, the defendant must demonstrate that counsel\u2019s performance was deficient, and that counsel\u2019s deficient performance prejudiced the defendant. <em>State v. Miner, </em>2012 MT 20, \u00b6 11, 364 Mont. 1, 271 P.3d 56. Under <em>Strickland\u2019s </em>second prong, we examine whether there is a reasonable probability that counsel\u2019s lack of reasonable professional conduct renders the trial result unreliable or the proceedings fundamentally unfair. <em>Miner, </em>\u00b6 12. If an insufficient showing is made regarding one prong of the test, there is no need to address the other prong. <em>Dawson v. State, </em>2000 MT 219, \u00b6 21, 301 Mont. 135, 10 P.3d 49 (quoting <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 697, 104 S. Ct. at 2069). \u201cIf it is easier to dispose of an ineffectiveness claim on the ground of lack of sufficient prejudice ... that course should be followed.\u201d <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 697, 104 S.Ct. at 2069.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-7\">\u00b619 Section 46-18-225, MCA, provides that a sentencing court must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>weigh alternatives to imprisonment for non-violent felony offenders, taking into account whether:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b133-5\">(a) the interests of justice and the needs of public safety truly require the level of security provided by imprisonment of the offender in a state prison;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b133-6\">(b) the needs of the offender can be better served in the community or in a facility or program other than a state prison;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b133-7\">(c) there are substantial grounds tending to excuse or justify the offense, though failing to establish a defense;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b133-8\">(d) the offender acted under strong provocation;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b133-9\">(e) the offender has made restitution or will make restitution to the victim of the offender\u2019s criminal conduct;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b133-10\">(f) the offender has no prior history of conviction for a criminal act or, if the offender has a prior history of conviction for a criminal act, the offender has led a law-abiding life for a substantial period of time before the commission of the present crime;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b133-11\">(g) the offender\u2019s criminal conduct was the result of circumstances that are unlikely to recur;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b133-12\">(h) the character and attitude of the offender indicate that the offender is likely to commit another crime;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b133-13\">(i) the offender is likely to respond quickly to correctional or rehabilitative treatment; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b133-14\">(j) imprisonment of the offender would create an excessive hardship on the offender or the offender\u2019s family.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b133-15\">Section 46-18-225(2), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-16\">\u00b620 Courts have an affirmative duty to consider the \u00a7 46-18-225 criteria in sentencing a non-violent offender. <em>State v. Nelson, </em>274 Mont. 11, 20, 906 P.2d 663, 668 (1995). While we would prefer \u201c[ejxplicit, rather than implicit consideration of the criteria,\u201d an absence of explicit consideration does not render a sentence illegal or incorrect. <em>Nelson, </em>52 Mont. at 20, 906 P.2d at 668. \u201cThe point is not to require some mechanical nod toward \u00a7 46-18-225, MCA, but rather to insure that in the appropriate case the District Court gives real consideration to ... a sentence other than imprisonment.\u201d <em>State v. Weisweaver, </em>2010 MT 198, \u00b6 15, 357 Mont. 384, 239 P.3d 952. In <em>State v. Wilson, </em>2011 MT 277, \u00b6 35, 362 Mont. 416, 264 P.3d 1146, a sentencing court did not specifically address the \u00a7 46-18-225 criteria but did address a number of concerns related to the criteria, such as likelihood of reoccurrence, prior criminal history, and the likelihood of correctional or rehabilitative success. Because those facts spoke directly to the \u00a7 46-18-225 criteria, we held that formal reference to the statute would not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>have resulted in a different sentence. <em>Wilson, </em>\u00b6 35.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-4\">\u00b621 We applied the same reasoning in <em>Weisweaver, </em>where the sentencing court failed to formally reference \u00a7 46-18-225 criteria and counsel did not object to that omission. <em>Weisweaver, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 6,16. Because the sentencing court considered Weisweaver\u2019s criminal history, the severity of his addiction, and his need for intensive treatment, we concluded that the court gave \u201cadequate consideration to the relevant circumstances ... and to his susceptibility to alternative sentencing.\u201d <em>Weisweaver, </em>\u00b6 16. Since further consideration of the \u00a7 46-18-225 criteria would not have resulted in a different sentence, the defendant could not show prejudice from counsel's failure to object on those grounds. <em>Weisweaver, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 19-20.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-5\">\u00b622  We conclude that Zink cannot show prejudice from Hinchey\u2019s failure to formally invoke \u00a7 46-18-225, MCA. Hinchey argued for a probationary sentence instead of imprisonment and pointed to facts relating to the \u00a746-18-225 criteria. Although Zink presented testimony on his good character from co-workers and the potential impact of Zink\u2019s imprisonment on his elderly parents, the District Court also considered evidence that Zink had previously been charged with partner assault on Elizabeth and that she feared harm from him in the future. The Pre-Sentence Investigation report indicated that Zink tried to justify and minimize his responsibility for the assault, and Zink testified at sentencing that his actions towards Elizabeth were simply a misunderstanding. During the oral pronouncement of sentence, the court specifically recognized the severity of Zink\u2019s crime. These facts all speak directly to the criteria in \u00a7 46-18-225(2), MCA. Nothing in the record indicates that the court failed to properly consider facts relevant to those criteria. Zink fails to show how formed invocation of those criteria would have had any chance of success in changing the court\u2019s decision. Zink suffered no prejudice as a result of Hinchey\u2019s failure to invoke the statutory criteria in question, and therefore, his IAC claim fails the second prong of <em>Strickland. </em>Because this claim is easily disposed on <em>Strickland\u2019s </em>second prong, we need not evaluate whether Hinchey\u2019s representation of Zink was deficient. <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 697, 104 S. Ct. at <em>2069; Dawson, </em>\u00b6 21.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-6\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b134-7\">\u00b623 Zink was not simultaneously convicted on a lesser and greater offense, and has suffered no prejudice from his counsel\u2019s conduct at sentencing.
