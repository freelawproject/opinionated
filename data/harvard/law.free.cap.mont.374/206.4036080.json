The issue presented on appeal is whether Carter received ineffective assistance of counsel. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>PROCEDURAL AND FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b233-4\">\u00b62 On November <em>2, </em>2011, Richard Watson, a resident of Monroe, Washington, arrived at Carter\u2019s home in Missoula, Montana. Watson and his then-girlfriend had made the drive from Monroe for the purpose of selling approximately eight ounces of methamphetamine in Watson\u2019s possession. According to Watson, a friend named Chris Link had told Watson he \u201cknew a guy that could get rid of quantity\u201d of methamphetamine. Link introduced Watson to Carter. Carter was the \u201cmiddleman\u201d who would then introduce Watson to Billy Joe Johnson, the ultimate purchaser.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-5\">\u00b63 Watson and Johnson met at Carter\u2019s home that night. Watson testified he sold approximately three ounces of methamphetamine to Johnson. The transaction took place in Carter\u2019s bedroom with Carter present. Johnson wanted to purchase more of Watson\u2019s product, but did not have sufficient cash available at the time. It was agreed that Johnson would call Carter in the next day or two, and Watson and Carter would then drive out to Johnson\u2019s auto shop in Ravalli County and \u201cget rid of the rest of it.\u201d Watson was also interested in seeing the shop and the vehicles Johnson was working on there. Watson was unfamiliar with the area, so Carter agreed to show him the way to the shop.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-6\">\u00b64 On November 4, Johnson called Carter. Watson and Carter went to Johnson\u2019s shop. Watson drove the vehicle he had brought from Washington, and Carter sat in the passenger seat and gave directions. Watson testified that when the men arrived at the shop, he sold Johnson approximately two and a half ounces of methamphetamine. Watson weighed out the quantity using scales he had brought with him. Watson testified Carter was present in the shop for the transaction and stood four to five feet away as the other men weighed the methamphetamine and counted the cash.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-7\">\u00b65 Meanwhile, the Ravalli County Sheriffs Office had received a tip indicating Johnson was involved in dealing methamphetamine. Detective Jason Basnaw had learned that two men driving a vehicle with Washington State license plates would be arriving at Johnson\u2019s shop to deliver methamphetamine. Basnaw and another detective hoped to intercept the vehicle before it arrived at the shop. When they arrived at the shop, they saw a vehicle with Washington plates already parked in front. Soon after spotting the vehicle, Basnaw saw Johnson, Watson, and Carter exit the shop. The detectives detained the men and searched them for weapons, at which time Basnaw found a plastic baggie containing approximately an ounce of methamphetamine in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>Johnson\u2019s vest pocket.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-4\">\u00b66 Basnaw obtained search warrants for the shop and the vehicle. In the shop, officers found two baggies containing methamphetamine. They also found digital scales commonly used to measure methamphetamine and two \u201chide-a-cans,\u201d empty soda cans modified to have the look and feel of an unopened can, often used in drug trafficking. In the vehicle driven by Watson, officers found a camera bag containing another set of scales, two baggies of methamphetamine, and approximately $6,300 in cash. The three men were arrested. At booking, inventory searches were conducted. Carter was carrying $1,080 in cash. Johnson and Watson were carrying $2,359 and $4,082 in cash, respectively. A search of the call logs on three cell phones seized from Johnson showed nine calls between Johnson and Carter from November 2 to November 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-5\">\u00b67 Carter was charged by information with criminal distribution of dangerous drugs, criminal possession of dangerous drugs with intent to distribute, and use or possession of property subject to criminal forfeiture. His attorney moved to preclude \u201cany testimony or reference to acts or omissions which Defendant Roy Carter may be legally accountable for or have conspired in the commission of as Defendant Roy Carter is not charged with accountability for or conspiracy to commit any act.\u201d The State then amended the information, charging Carter with accountability for criminal distribution of dangerous drugs, conspiracy, and use or possession of property subject to criminal forfeiture. Carter moved to dismiss the amended information on the grounds that he was prejudiced by the untimely amendment and could not be convicted of both a conspiracy charge and the underlying offense. The State filed a second amended information, charging Carter with accountability for criminal distribution of dangerous drugs or, in the alternative, conspiracy, and use or possession of property subject to criminal forfeiture. Carter also moved to dismiss the second amended information, and the motion was denied. Following a jury trial, Carter was found guilty of accountability for criminal distribution of dangerous drugs. He was committed to the custody of the Department of Corrections for fifteen years, with ten years suspended.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-6\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b234-7\">\u00b68 Claims of ineffective assistance of counsel raise mixed questions of law and fact, which we review de novo. <em>State v. St. Germain, </em>2007 MT 28, \u00b6 14, 336 Mont. 17, 153 P.3d 591.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b235-4\">\u00b69 Carter claims his attorney provided ineffective assistance by moving to preclude evidence of accountability or conspiracy, because the motion alerted the State to what he refers to as its charging error. Carter claims the actions of his attorney prompted the State to amend the charges and thereby assured his conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-5\">\u00b610 We apply the standard set forth in <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 687, 104 S. Ct. 2052, 2064, 80 L. Ed. 2d 674 (1984), to determine whether counsel provided ineffective assistance. <em>Whitlow v. State, </em>2008 MT 140, \u00b6 10, 343 Mont. 90, 183 P.3d 861. The defendant must show that counsel\u2019s performance was deficient, and that the deficient performance prejudiced the defense. <em>Whitlow, </em>\u00b6 10. We need not address both components of this standard if the defendant fails to prove one. <em>State v. Miner, </em>2012 MT 20, \u00b6 11, 364 Mont. 1, 271 P.3d 56.</p>\n<p id=\"A2h\">\u00b611 In evaluating whether counsel\u2019s performance was deficient, we apply a strong presumption that counsel acted \u201c \u2018within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance.\u2019 \u201d <em>Whitlow, </em>\u00b6 21 (quoting <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 689, 104 S. Ct. at 2065). The defendant must show \u201c \u2018that counsel made errors so serious that counsel was not functioning as the \u201ccounsel\u201d guaranteed the defendant by the Sixth Amendment.\u2019 \u201d <em>Whitlow, </em>\u00b6 10 (quoting <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 687, 104 S. Ct. at 2064). A reviewing cotut must avoid the distortions of hindsight and the temptation to second-guess counsel\u2019s performance after an adverse result. <em>Bomar v. State, </em>2012 MT 163, \u00b6 19, 365 Mont. 474, 285 P.3d 396. The Sixth Amendment does not guarantee perfect advocacy, and success is not the measure of effective representation. <em>Bomar, </em>\u00b6 19.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-6\">\u00b612 Our legal system \u201cis not yet a poker game in which players enjoy an absolute right always to conceal their cards until played.\u201d <em>Williams v. Fla., </em>399 U.S. 78, 82, 90 S. Ct. 1893, 1896, 26 L. Ed. 2d 446 (1970). Rather, it is subject to rules and procedures designed to \u201cavoid surprise, aid the administration of the trial courts and provide an orderly resolution of the charge.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Carkulis v. Dist. Ct., </em>229 Mont. 265, 273, 746 P.2d 604, 609 (1987); <em>see also </em>\u00a7 46-1-103(2), MCA (Rules of Criminal Procedure \u201csecure simplicity in procedure, fairness in administration, and elimination of unjustifiable expense and delay.\u201d). A criminal trial is, above all, a search for truth, not a game of surprise or concealment. <em>State v. Davidson, </em>266 Mont. 404, 410, 880 P.2d 1331, 1335 (1994); <em>Carkulis, </em>229 Mont. at 272, 746 P.2d at 609; <em>State ex rel. Sikora v. Dist. Ct., </em>154 Mont. 241, 247-48, 462 P.2d 897, 901 (1969). Thus, to avoid unnecessary surprise and delay, a defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>is required to give pretrial notice of affirmative defenses, to provide a list of the witnesses who will be called at trial, and to disclose the statements of those witnesses. <em>Carkulis, </em>229 Mont. at 272-73, 276, 746 P.2d at 609, 611. The defendant is not entitled to \u201cawait the end of the State\u2019s case before announcing the nature of his defense...\u201d <em>Williams, </em>399 U.S. at 85, 90 S. Ct. at 1898.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-4\">\u00b613  Carter\u2019s argument that his attorney\u2019s performance fell below reasonable professional standards because he failed to \u201cconceal [his] cards\u201d until the State had concluded its presentation of evidence is entirely without merit. <em>Williams, </em>399 U.S. at 82, 90 S. Ct. at 1896. On the contrary, the record reveals that Carter\u2019s attorney was a diligent advocate for his client who challenged the State\u2019s case at every turn. Carter was simply not entitled to lie in wait and ambush the State by objecting to the charges mid-trial. The efforts of Carter\u2019s attorney were well within the wide range of reasonable professional conduct, and the fact of Carter\u2019s conviction does not establish that he received ineffective representation.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-5\">\u00b614 Having failed to show that the performance of counsel was deficient, Carter cannot sustain his burden under the <em>Strickland </em>standard. 466 U.S. at 700, 104 S. Ct. at 2071. It is unnecessary to address whether Carter was prejudiced by the actions of counsel. <em>Miner, </em>\u00b6 11. Nevertheless, we also note that \u201c[c]riminal accountability is not considered a substantive separate offense, but merely a conduit by which to find a person criminally liable for the acts of another.\u201d <em>State v. Tower, </em>267 Mont. 63, 67-68, 881 P.2d 1317, 1320 (1994). We have consistently reaffirmed this principle. <em>State v. Tellegen, </em>2013 MT 337, \u00b6\u00b6 8-9, 372 Mont. 454, 314 P.3d 902. The State was not required to set forth a theory of accountability in the charging documents. <em>Tower, </em>267 Mont. at 67, 881 P.2d at 1320. Under well-settled Montana law, Carter could have been convicted of criminal distribution of dangerous drugs on a theory of accountability regardless of whether the State had amended its information. <em>Tower, </em>267 Mont. at 67, 881 P.2d at 1320.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-6\">\u00b615 For the reasons stated above, the conviction is affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b236-7\">JUSTICES BAKER, WHEAT, McKINNON and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
