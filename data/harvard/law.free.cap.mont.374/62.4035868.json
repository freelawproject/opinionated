On October 26, 2009, Robert Van Orden (Van Orden) was involved in a motor vehicle accident caused by another driver. Van Orden carried an automobile insurance policy (the USAA Policy) through United Services Automobile Association General Indemnity Company (USAA). The USAA Policy included separate, optional collision coverage (Part D). Part D applied to losses suffered by Van Orden\u2019s vehicle as a result of a collision. It covered the actual cash value of the loss minus a $500 deductible. The USAA Policy defined \u201closs\u201d as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b90-8\">direct and accidental damage to the operational safety, function, or appearance of, or theft of, your covered auto or equipment and accessories that are not permanently installed in your covered auto. Loss includes a total loss, but does not include any damage other than the cost to repair or replace. Loss does not include any loss-of-use, or diminution in value that would remain after repair or replacement of the damaged or stolen property.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b90-9\">Other provisions of the USAA Policy included underinsured motorist (UIM) coverage with bodily injury limits of $25,000 per person and $50,000 per accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-10\">\u00b65 The at-fault driver maintained automobile insurance coverage at the time of the accident through Alpha Property &amp; Casualty Insurance Company (the Alpha Policy) which was underwritten by Unitrin Specialty Insurance (Unitrin). The Alpha Policy included liability limits of $25,000 per person for bodily injuries and a separate limit of $25,000 for property damage per accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-11\">\u00b66 As a result of the accident, Van Orden sustained both bodily injury and property damage. His property damage included $12,261.75 in vehicle repair costs and $720 for the use of a rental car. The parties <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>agree that this $12,981.75 is the total amount of property damage incurred by Van Orden as a result of the accident. USAA paid the vehicle repair and car rental costs directly to the merchants who supplied those services for Van Orden. Because the at-fault driver carried an active insurance policy, USAA waived Van Orden\u2019s $500 deductible; Van Orden incurred no out-of-pocket expenses for his properly damage.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-4\">\u00b67 For the bodily iiquries suffered because of the accident, Van Orden recovered $24,430.19 from Unitrin under the bodily injury liability limits of the Alpha Policy and $50,000 from USAA under the UIM coverage of the USAA Policy. Van Orden claims that his bodily injury damages and costs to recover those damages exceed both the payments he has received and the limits of the bodily injury liability coverage of the Alpha Policy and the UIM coverage of his Policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-5\">\u00b68 USAA sought subrogation for the property damage expenses from Unitrin on November 24, 2009. On December 8, 2009, Unitrin paid USAA $12,981.75 out of the property damage liability limits of the Alpha Policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-6\">\u00b69 On February 24, 2011, Van Orden filed an action in Montana\u2019s Eighth Judicial District Court, Cascade County, on behalf of himself and a putative class of plaintiffs. He alleged that USAA violated Montana law by seeking subrogation for property damage loss from a tortfeasor\u2019s automobile liability insurer before its insured had been made whole with respect to related personal injuries. USAA removed the action to the U.S. District Court for the District of Montana and filed a motion for summary judgment; following a hearing, the U.S. District Court certified its question to this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-7\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b91-8\">\u00b610 When answering a certified question from another qualifying court as permitted by M. R. App. P. 15(3), our review is \u201cpurely an interpretation of the law as applied to the agreed facts underlying the action.\u201d <em>BNSF Ry. Co. v. Feit, </em>2012 MT 147, \u00b6 6, 365 Mont. 359, 281 P.3d 225 (quoting <em>State Farm Fire &amp; Cas. Co. v. Bush Hog, LLC, </em>2009 MT 349, \u00b6 4, 353 Mont. 173, 219 P.3d 1249).</p>\n<p id=\"b91-9\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b91-10\">\u00b611 Subrogation is the \u201csubstitution of one party for another whose debt the party pays, entitling the paying party to rights, remedies, or securities that would otherwise belong to the debtor.\u201d <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>1563-64 (Bryan A. Garner ed., 9th ed., West 2009). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>Subrogation acts as an equitable device \u201cdesigned to compel the ultimate payment of a debt by the one who injustice, equity and good conscience should pay it.\u201d <em>Skauge v. Mt. States Tel. &amp; Tel. Co., </em>172 Mont. 521, 524, 565 P.2d 628, 630 (1977). \u201c \u2018It is an appropriate means of preventing unjust enrichment.\u2019 \u201d <em>DeTienne Assocs. Ltd. Partn. v. Farmers Union Mut. Ins. Co., </em>266 Mont. 184, 188, 879 P.2d 704, 707 (1994) (quoting <em>Youngblood v. Am. States Ins. Co., </em>262 Mont. 391, 866 P.2d 203 (1993)). An insurer who has indemnified its insured usually is subrogated to the insured\u2019s rights of recovery against a third party who is responsible for the loss. <em>Skauge, </em>172 Mont. at 524, 565 P.2d at 630. The polity underlying this equitable right of subrogation is that \u201cabsent repayment of the insurer the insured would be unjustly enriched by virtue of recovery from both the insurer and the wrongdoer, or in the absence of such double recovery by the insured, the third party would go free despite his legal obligation in connection with loss.\u201d <em>Skauge, </em>172 Mont. at 524-25, 565 P.2d at 630.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-4\">\u00b612  An insurer\u2019s right to subrogation is limited, however, by the recognition that an insured is entitled to be fully compensated for his or her damages. Known as the \u201cmade whole doctrine,\u201d this principle was explained in <em>Skauge, </em>where we held that \u201cwhen the insured has sustained a loss in excess of the reimbursement by the insurer, the insured is entitled to be made whole for his entire loss and any costs of recovery, including attorney\u2019s fees, before the insurer can assert its right of legal subrogation against the insured or the tort-feasor.\u201d <em>Skauge, </em>172 Mont. at 528, 565 P.2d at 632. The plaintiffs in <em>Skauge </em>suffered fire damage in excess of the $4,000 policy limit paid out under their fire insurance policy through Unigard Insurance Group. <em>Skauge, </em>172 Mont. at 523, 565 P.2d at 629. Seeking the remainder of their damages, Plaintiffs commenced a negligence action against the parties they believed to be responsible for the fire. <em>Skauge, </em>172 Mont. at 523, 565 P.2d at 529. Because the Skauges had not yet been fully compensated for their losses, this Court reversed the district court\u2019s determination that Unigard was entitled to subrogation for the $4,000 paid under the insurance policy. <em>Skauge, </em>172 Mont. at 528-29, 565 P.2d at 632.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-5\">\u00b613 The made whole doctrine is consistent with the equitable principles underlying subrogation because plaintiffs who are not yet compensated for their loss are not unjustly enriched by recovering from both parties, and third-party tortfeasors are not relieved of their legal obligation for the loss. \u201cWhen the sum recovered by the Insured from the Tortfeasor is less than the total loss and thus either the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>Insured or the Insurer must to some extent go unpaid, <em>the loss should be borne by the insurer[,] for that is a risk the insured has paid it to assume\u201d Skauge, </em>172 Mont. at 528, 565 P.2d at 632 (quoting <em>St. Paul Fire &amp; Marine Ins. Co. v. W.P. Rose Supply Co., </em>198 S.E. 2d 482, 484 (N.C. App. 1973)) (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b93-4\">\u00b614 This Court has affirmed application of the made whole doctrine in numerous subsequent decisions. We held that the equitable subrogation principles articulated in <em>Skauge </em>control an insurer\u2019s subrogation rights over standard insurance policy language mandating repayment of all money paid out under the policy. <em>DeTienne, </em>266 Mont. at 184, 879 P.2d at 704. We later answered \u201cyes\u201d to a certified question asking, \u201c[i]s it the public policy in Montana that an insured must be totally reimbursed for all losses as well as costs, including attorney fees, involved in recovering those losses before the insurer can exercise any right of subrogation, regardless of contract language to the contrary?\u201d <em>Swanson v. Hartford Ins. Co., </em>2002 MT 81, \u00b6 14, 309 Mont. 269, 46 P.3d 584.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-5\">\u00b615 The dissent to <em>Swanson </em>urged the Court to adopt a more narrow interpretation of when an insured is made whole \u2014 limiting the definition to all compensation, including costs and attorney\u2019s fees, for only that element of damage for which the insured purchased insurance. <em>Swanson, </em>\u00b6 36 (Leaphart, J., concurring in part and dissentinginpart). The majority dismissed this interpretation, stating, \u201c[sjeldom to never do we find such perfect symmetry in an award or settlement. Typically, as here, the ultimate settlement (or judgment amount) is for a gross amount, without allocation for each particular element of loss.\u201d <em>Swanson, </em>\u00b6 26.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-6\">\u00b616 Van Orden argues that this passage demonstrates that the <em>Swanson </em>court expressly declined to adopt the more narrow interpretation that USAA now asks us to embrace. Such a reading of <em>Swanson </em>ignores the fact that those circumstances were not before the Court at that time. The Court there acknowledged, \u201cIf a plaintiff recovered a discrete amount from her insurer for a particular element of loss, and then recovered the identical amount from a third party, plus her costs and attorney fees associated with that recoveiy, and the amounts of each were specifically and separately determined either by agreement or in a judgment, then, in theory, subrogation should proceed.\u201d <em>Swanson, </em>\u00b6 25. The Court declined to adopt this as a blanket rule, however, for fear that \u201cwe would be left to speculate as to whether the insured did recover the identical amount of the loss for which the insurer seeks subrogation.\u201d <em>Swanson, </em>\u00b6 26.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>\u00b617 Under the conditions set forth in the certified question, there is no need for speculation as to whether Van Orden is fully covered for the loss USAA seeks to recover. It is undisputed that Van Orden sustained $12,981.75 in total property damage, USAA paid that full amount under a separate and optional property damage portion of his policy, and USAA received that amount from a separate property damage liability limit of the at-fault driver\u2019s insurance policy. Now faced with the precise situation acknowledged in <em>Swanson, </em>we agree with our statement there that subrogation may proceed in these circumstances. The insured has been made whole for the element of damage for which he purchased insurance.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-4\">\u00b618 To hold otherwise would not give effect to \u00a7 33-23-203(2), MCA. The legislature revised this statute in 1997 to allow an insurer to include reasonable subrogation clauses in its contracts \u201cto prevent duplicate payments for the same element of loss under the motor vehicle liability policy....\u201d \u201cWhen interpreting a statute, we first look to the plain meaning of its words.\u201d <em>Hendershott v. Westphal, </em>2011 MT 73, \u00b6 20, 360 Mont. 66, 253 P.3d 806. When the language of a statute is clear, it \u201cspeaks for itself and we will not resort to other means of interpretation.\u201d <em>Wolf v. Wolf, </em>2011 MT 192, \u00b6 11, 361 Mont. 324, 258 P.3d 995. Van Orden argues that duplicate payments do not arise under \u00a7 33-23-203(2), MCA, until an insured has been made whole for <em>all </em>damages \u2014 even those not covered under the policy at issue. He contends that the Court in <em>Swanson </em>specifically rejected the idea that the viability of the made whole doctrine was affected by the legislative adoption of \u00a7 33-23-203(2), MCA. USAA counters that Van Orden\u2019s interpretation ignores the plain language of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-5\">\u00b619 The statute expressly states that an insurer may prevent duplicate payments for the <em>same element of loss. </em>In <em>Swanson, </em>the insurer argued that \u00a7 33-22-203(2), MCA, as amended, limits the application of the made whole doctrine. <em>Swanson, </em>\u00b6 22. We disagreed that the statute substantively altered the made whole doctrine, noting that \u201cthe common law and the statute jointly establish two rules of subrogation.\u201d First, \u201can insured should not receive duplicate payments for the same element of loss,\u201d and second, \u201cthe insurer may not assert subrogation rights until the insured has been fully compensated for his damages, including attorney fees and costs.\u201d <em>Swanson, </em>\u00b6 23.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-6\">\u00b620  The record was unclear in <em>Swanson </em>as to whether the plaintiffs were fully compensated for any particular element of loss. <em>Swanson, </em>\u00b6 41 (Leaphart, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part). Our recent cases, however, make clear that an insured\u2019s receipt <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>of duplicate payments for the same element of loss may constitute a windfall to the insured if the coverage is limited to a discrete item, such as payment of medical expenses. <em>See Conway v. Benefis Health Sys., </em>2013 MT 73, \u00b6 35, 369 Mont. 309, 297 P.3d 1200 (citing <em>Newbury v. State Farm. Fire &amp; Cas. Ins. Co., </em>2008 MT 156, \u00b6 38, 343 Mont. 279, 184 P.3d 1021). In <em>Conway, </em>we held that \u201cmedical payments coverage is for the payment of medical expenses only; it does not provide for the payment of additional or excess sums to the insured.\u201d <em>Conway, </em>\u00b6 35. We rejected the insured\u2019s argument that he was entitled to pocket the difference between the medical payment coverage and his health insurance\u2019s contractual reimbursement rate. <em>Conway, </em>\u00b6 35. In <em>Newbury, </em>the Plaintiff argued that a provision in his automobile insurance policy \u2014 disallowing coverage when medical expenses are payable by workers\u2019 compensation benefits \u2014 violated Montana public policy. <em>Newbury, </em>\u00b6 43. While we agreed with Newbury that he paid valuable consideration to have his medical expenses paid, we held that because his medical expenses were paid through workers\u2019 compensation benefits, receiving in \u201cexcess of the total amount of his medical expenses would result in a windfall to Newbury.\u201d <em>Newbury, </em>\u00b6 47.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-3\">\u00b621 Van Orden argues that because he has not yet recovered all of his personal injury damages, the amount USAA recovered under the tortfeasor\u2019s property liability limit must go toward making him whole for those damages. Other than pointing to the broad rule articulated in <em>Swanson, </em>however, Van Orden fails to present authority for the proposition that a sum received from a separate property liability portion of a tortfeasor\u2019s insurance policy may be received as compensation for his personal injury damages. Similar to <em>Newbury </em>and <em>Conway, </em>he paid consideration to cover a potential loss and he received the benefit of that premium when USAA paid for all the costs associated with his property damage. He has not demonstrated how he could recover additional amounts directly from the property damage portion of the tortfeasor\u2019s policy. <em>See Conway, </em>\u00b6 37. Even assuming that Van Orden\u2019s damages exceeded the combined payouts from USAA and Unitrin, under no circumstances would the remaining money available under the property damage coverage of the Alpha Policy spill over into the bodily injury pool of money, or be subject to attachment for the payment of attorney\u2019s fees or costs. Because this additional property damage money would not be available to Van Orden whatever the situation, USAA is clearly not asserting an interest in sums that Van Orden otherwise would be able to recover from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>tortfeasor's policy. USAA is not taking any money out of Van Orden's pocket.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-4\">\u00b622 The Dissent\u2019s criticism of this conclusion is premised on its theory that <em>\u201call </em>available insurance coverage proceeds, from whatever source, go into one pot.\u201d Dissent, \u00b6 42. Seemingly, this would mean that the Alpha Policy\u2019s property damage coverage, from which USAAis seeking recovery, should be available along with any other insurance proceeds to make Van Orden whole. Yet, the Dissent asserts that it is not advocating for this outcome. Dissent, \u00b6 42. We therefore cannot understand what would be the effect of the Dissent\u2019s \u201cone pot\u201d proposal, nor has the Dissent explained how \u2014 by denying USAA its limited subrogation right \u2014 the pot of money available to make Van Orden whole would somehow expand. It bears repeating that we have refused to permit subrogation in those cases where the sums the insurer is attempting to collect would deplete the sum of money otherwise available to the injured party from the liable third party.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Dissent cites <em>Allstate Ins. Co. v. Reitler, </em>192 Mont. 351, 628 P.2d 667 (1981) and <em>Youngblood </em>for the proposition that we have refused to enforce contract provisions allowing subrogation before an insured is made whole. Dissent, \u00b6 32. These cases pre-date the operative language in \u00a7 33-23-203(2), MCA, and involved an insurer attempting subrogation against <em>any </em>liability coverage the insured might have had against the third party. <em>Allstate, </em>192 Mont. at 353, 628 P.2d at 668; <em>Youngblood, </em>262 Mont. at 399, 866 P.2d at 207. As indicated, that is not the case here.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-5\">\u00b623  <em>Newbury </em>and <em>Conway </em>support our determination that access to additional payments for property damage under the Alpha Policy would result in a double recoveiy for the same element of loss. <em>See also </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number><em>Forsman v. United Fin. Cas. Co., </em>2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 118893 (D. Mont. Aug. 21, 2013) (No. CV 12-157-M-DWM) (Plaintiffs who had recovered their collision damages from third-party tortfeasor\u2019s coverage failed to make a plausible claim that they were denied any \u201crecoverable\u201d damages under their own collision coverage in policy that denied duplicate recovery for same element of loss). That Van Orden is not yet made whole as to his personal injury damages does not control our analysis because Part D of the USAA Policy provided coverage for property loss only. \u201cWhat [Van Orden] paid valuable consideration for in this case was to have his [property damage] expenses paid and it is undisputed that his [property damage] expenses were paid.\u201d <em>Newbury, </em>\u00b6 47.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-4\">\u00b624 The Dissent acknowledges that \u201cthe subrogated insurer stands in no better position than the insured ... .\u201d Dissent, \u00b6 40 (quoting <em>DeTienne, </em>266 Mont. at 189, 879 P.2d at 707). The point the Dissent concedes is that, standing in his own position, Van Orden could not recover directly from the third-party tortfeasor\u2019s property damage policy coverage any more than he already recovered from USAA. USAA recovered only the amount of property damage suffered by Van Orden, which it had wholly covered for him under Part D of the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"AG3\">\u00b625  When a settlement or judgment does not allocate payment for separate elements of loss under discrete portions of a policy for which a premium separately has been paid, subrogation may not proceed until the insured is made whole for all of his or her damages. But when, as here, damages are discrete, readily-ascertainable, and completely covered under a separate policy or portion of the poluy for which a separate premium has been paid, subrogation may proceed as to that element of loss only. According proper deference both to the plain language of the applicable statute and to this Court\u2019s prior rulings, this holding balances an insurer\u2019s statutory right to prevent double recovery and an insured\u2019s right to be made whole for all of his or her damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-5\">\u00b626  Based on the foregoing, we answer the certified question \u201cno\u201d: Montana law does not prevent an insurer from exercising its right to subrogation under the limited, specific circumstances presented in the certified question.</p>\n<judges id=\"b97-6\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES COTTER, RICE, McKINNON and DISTRICT JUDGE SALVAGNI, sitting for former JUSTICE MORRIS, concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b96-6\"> <em>Compare Swanson, </em>\u00b6 5 (Hartford sought to invoke a subrogation clause granting it the right to recover any payments to the insured under the insured\u2019s personal injury protection coverage if the insured recovers damages from a third party); <em>DeTienne, </em>266 Mont. at 186-92, 879 P.2d at 706-09 (insurer sought subrogation rights for stuns paid under a \u201cspecial multi-peril insurance policy\u201d based on language in policy that insurer \u201cshall be subrogated to <em>all the insured\u2019s rights </em>of recoveiy against any third person\u201d); <em>Skauge, </em>172 Mont. at 523, 565 P.2d at 629 (policy language provided for assignment of \u201call right of recovery against any party for loss to the extent that payment therefore [sic] is made by this Company\u201d); with <em>Newbury, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 38-39, 47 (insured not entitled to seek payment under <em>medical payments portion </em>of his policy when his employer\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation carrier already had paid his medical expenses); and <em>Conway, </em>\u00b6 35 (relying on <em>Newbury, </em>holding that insured could not recover under medical payments coverage when his medical expenses already had been paid).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b97-7\">JUSTICE WHEAT</author>\n<p id=\"AE27\">dissents.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-8\">\u00b627 I would answer yes to the certified question.

Segalla, <em>Couch on Insurance 3d </em>vol. 16, \u00a7 223:149, 223-168 (West 2005) (\u201cWhen the make whole rule is applied to a circumstance in which the insurer and insured are not in agreement as to whether the insured has, in fact, been made whole so as to allow the insurer to make some recovery of its payment, there must be a legal determination of that fact.\u201d); <em>see also Skauge v. Mt. States Tel. &amp; Tel.

Following in the footsteps of the U.S. District Court for the District of Montana in <em>Forsman v. United Fin. Cas. Co., </em>CV 12-157, 966 F. Supp. 2d 1091 (Mont. Aug. 21, 2013), the majority now dissects the insurance coverages in such a way that our long-standing made whole doctrine is undermined. The majority\u2019s reasoning paints the injured party as recovering a windfall, even though the injured parly paid for the coverage the insurance company seeks to subrogate, before a total made whole determination has occurred. \u201cAny change in the law that results in the insurer avoiding transfer of part or all of the risk for which it accepted premiums is destructive to the very foundation and purpose of insurance.\u201d Greg Munro, <em>Medical Pay </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number><em>Coverage, Bodily Injury Coverage, and the Group Health Plans: Who is Going to Pay Tort Medical Expenses and When?, </em>Trial Trends 16, 17 (Winter 2014). The majority\u2019s departure from all of our precedent regarding subrogation undermines the made-whole doctrine to the detriment of insured Montanans.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-4\">\u00b629 We have long recognized in the field of liability insurance that it is good public policy to protect and defend the injured person\u2019s right to be made whole before an insurance company is allowed to subrogate, especially when the injured person has paid for the coverage at issue. <em>Skauge, </em>172 Mont. at 528, 565 P.2d at 632; <em>DeTienne, </em>266 Mont. at 190, 879 P.2d at 708; <em>Swanson, </em>\u00b6 28. It is also a longstanding principle that if someone must suffer a loss, it should be the insurance company, not the injured person. <em>Skauge, </em>172 Mont. at 528, 565 P.2d at 632; <em>DeTienne, </em>266 Mont. at 190, 879 P.2d at 708; <em>Swanson, </em>\u00b6 27. \u201cThe only practical way we can satisfy this principle is to allow full compensation to the plaintiff first, before subrogation is allowed.\u201d <em>Swanson, </em>\u00b6 27. Unfortunately, in this case the majority has opened the door for insurance companies to start chipping away at the made whole doctrine under the guise of allowing subrogation between \u201cdiscrete\u201d coverages, even if the injured person has not been made whole.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-5\">\u00b630 The majority\u2019s approach effectuates a change in the law by allowing insurance companies to divide what it means to be \u201cmade whole\u201d into discrete elements of loss. There are essentially two approaches to what it means to be made whole. Jeffrey A. Greenblatt, <em>Insurance and Subrogation: When the Pie Isn\u2019t Big Enough, Who Eats Last?, </em>64 U. Chi. L. Rev. 1337, 1343-44 (Fall 1997). The first approach, which this Court has traditionally followed, is to allow subrogation only when the insured has been compensated <em>\"for all the elements of damage, not merely those damages for which the insurer has indemnified him.\u201d </em>Greenblatt, 64 U. Chi. L. Rev. at 1344 (emphasis added); <em>see </em>Russ &amp; Segalla, <em>Couch on Insurance 3d </em>at \u00a7 223:133, 223-146 to 223-149. The second will allow separate elements of a damage award to be identified and credited to the subrogated claims, even if the insured has not been made whole with regard to his other claims. Greenblatt, 64 U. Chi. L. Rev. at 1344. The second approach generally relies on principles of contract law to allow insurers to contract around the traditional made whole doctrine. <em>See eg. Gibson v. Country Mut. Ins. Co., </em>549 N.E.2d 23 (1990); <em>Forsman; see also </em>Russ &amp; Segalla, <em>Couch on Insurance 3d </em>at \u00a7 223-147, 223-163 to 223-165. Courts adhering to the first approach have generally held that the equitable principles underlying subrogation override contract terms of this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>nature. Russ &amp; Segalla, <em>Couch on Insurance 3d </em>at \u00a7 223:148, 223-166 to 223-167. Adopting the second view, now, is a shift in the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-4\">\u00b631 This Court\u2019s precedent has generally emphasized the equitable principles underlying subrogation in the context of the made whole doctrine. We have explained that subrogation, at its origin, is a device of equity which is designed to compel the ultimate payment of a debt by the one who in justice, equity and good conscience should pay it. <em>Skauge, </em>172 Mont. at 524, 565 P.2d at 630. Accordingly, we held that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AAk\">[W]hen the insured has sustained a loss in excess of the reimbursement by the insurer, the insured is entitled to be made whole for his entire loss and any costs of recovery, including attorney\u2019s fees, before the insurer can assert its right of legal subrogation against the insured or the tort-feasor.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b100-5\"><em>Skauge, </em>172 Mont. at 528, 565 P.2d at 632. We elaborated in <em>Youngblood </em>that \u201c[sjubrogation is an equitable doctrine which is not dependent on any contractual relationship between the parties and is not dependent on privity.\u201d <em>Youngblood, </em>262 Mont. at 395, 866 P.2d at 205. In <em>DeTienne </em>we clarified the purpose of the <em>Skauge </em>ruling \u201cis the adoption of the equitable principle that an insured must be totally reimbursed for all losses as well as the costs involved in recovering those losses.\u201d <em>DeTienne, </em>266 Mont. at 191, 879 P.2d at 708. We explained that the purpose of subrogation \u201cis <em>not </em>to ensure that the risk-taker, the insurer, be compensated for all money it paid to policy holders[.]\u201d <em>DeTienne, </em>266 Mont. at 189, 879 P.2d at 707 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b100-6\">\u00b632 Relying on these equitable principles, we have declined to enforce contract provisions that would allow subrogation before an insured has been made whole. In <em>Swanson, </em>we held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b100-7\">[I]t is the public policy in Montana that an insured must be totally reimbursed for <em>all losses as well as costs, including attorney fees, involved in recovering those losses </em>before the insurer can exercise any right of subrogation, <em>regardless of any contract language providing to the contrary.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b100-8\"><em>Swanson, </em>\u00b6 28 (emphasis added). We have allowed subrogation only after the insured has been fully made whole and declined to enforce contract provisions that would beg a different result. For instance, in <em>Youngblood </em>we overturned the contract-based reasoning we had used in <em>Allstate Ins. Co. v. Reitler, </em>192 Mont. 351, 628 P.2d 667 (1981), explaining that we had reached the correct result \u201cnot because there was a prohibited assignment of a personal injury claim, but because of the public policy reasons expressed therein ... and because Allstate\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>right to reimbursement via subrogation was dependent upon the ability of the indemnified party to sue the tortfeasor.\u201d <em>Youngblood, </em>262 Mont. at 397, 866 P.2d at 206. In <em>DeTienne </em>we cited <em>Youngblood </em>in refusingto strictly interpret a subrogation clause, instead emphasizing the equitable \u201cpurpose of subrogation.\u201d <em>DeTienne, </em>266 Mont. at 189, 879 P.2d at 707. Transitioning to an approach that allows parties to contract around the made whole doctrine by splitting what it means to be \u201cmade whole\u201d into discrete elements of loss, we open Pandora\u2019s box of potential contract-based arguments for eroding the equitable foundations of subrogation.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-4\">\u00b633 USAA does not cite a single case in which we have held that a made whole determination may be segmented into discrete elements of loss. Instead, USAA relies on Justice Leaphart\u2019s concurrence and dissent in <em>Swanson </em>and on a case from Louisiana. To support its contention that we should now allow such segmentation, USAA quotes language from <em>Swanson, </em>where we explained that \u201can insured should not receive duplicate payments for the same element of loss ... .\u201d <em>Swanson, </em>\u00b6 23. Conveniently, USAA omits the rest of the sentence following the quoted language: \u201c[A]nd the insurer may not assert subrogation rights until the insured has been fully compensated for his damages, including attorney fees and costs.\u201d These two principles, we explained in <em>Swanson, </em>are two rules of subrogation jointly established by the common law and statute. <em>Swanson, </em>\u00b6 23. In the sentence directly prior to paragraph 23 in <em>Swanson, </em>we explained that \u201cduplicate payments do not occur until the insured has been made whole for all losses, as well as costs of recovery.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b101-5\">\u00b634 The majority appears to accept USAA\u2019s argument and now incorrectly reads <em>Swanson </em>to permit segmenting a made whole determination, when that result is at odds with <em>Swanson\u2019s </em>holding. In <em>Swanson, </em>we affirmed application of the made-whole doctrine based on the argument that it is difficult to tell whether an insured has been fully reimbursed for a particular element of loss. <em>See Swanson, </em>\u00b6 26. This, it should be noted, is one of two common rhetorical devices courts used to reject insurers\u2019 requests for subrogation in the bodily injury context when precedent uniformly held that such subrogation was barred as a matter of public policy. <em>See </em>Brendan S. Maher &amp; Radha A. Pathak, <em>Understanding and Problematizing Contractual Tort Subrogation, </em>40 Loy. U. Chi. L. J. 49, 71 (2008). It stands to reason that the purpose of our language in <em>Swanson </em>was to cement the made whole doctrine, not to signal a situation in which the made whole doctrine might not apply. The majority, however, distinguishes the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>instant case on the basis that Van Orden has been reimbursed for the cost of his property damage. In distinguishing <em>Swanson </em>on that basis, the majority will now allow USAA to subrogate before Van Orden has been made whole, ignoring <em>Swanson\u2019s </em>unequivocal holding:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b102-4\">[I]t is the public policy in Montana that an insured must be totally reimbursed for <em>all losses as well as costs, including attorney fees, involved in recovering those losses </em>before the insurer can exercise any right of subrogation, <em>regardless of any contract language providing to the contrary.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b102-5\"><em>Swanson, </em>\u00b6 28 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b102-6\">\u00b635 The minority\u2019s argument that its resolution of this issue in this manner is necessary to give effect to \u00a7 33-23-203(2), MCA, allowing subrogation to prevent \u201cduplicate payments for the same element of loss,\u201d also ignores <em>Swanson. </em>In <em>Swanson </em>this Court addressed duplicate payments, explaining that since we presume that the legislature is aware of the existing law, including our decisions interpreting individual statutes, the statute should be read to provide that \u201cduplicate payments do not occur until the insured has been made whole <em>for all losses, as well as costs of recovery.\u201d Swanson, </em>\u00b6 22 (emphasis added). The majority, instead, distinguishes our reading of the statute in <em>Swanson </em>on the basis that \u201c[tjhe record was unclear in <em>Swanson </em>as to whether the plaintiffs were fully compensated for any particular element of loss.\u201d Opinion, \u00b6 20 (citing <em>Swanson, </em>\u00b6 41 (Leaphart, J., dissenting)). This reasoning adopts an approach that this Court specifically rejected in <em>Swanson </em>\u2014 engaging in a presumption that the insured was fully compensated, without full fact-finding. <em>Swanson, </em>\u00b6 26. <em>Swanson </em>provided that it could not be determined whether the plaintiff had been fully compensated for any particular element of loss until the plaintiff had been made whole for all losses, as well as costs of recovery. That has not happened, here.</p>\n<p id=\"A1y\">\u00b636 The facts of the instant case are also distinguishable from those in <em>Conway said Newbury, </em>on which the majority\u2019s opinion relies. Both of those cases involved only competing insurance policies carried by the insured injured party. The foil extent of the injuries at issue was known at the time the cases were determined. Neither case involved a tortfeasor, or a tortfeasor\u2019s insurance company. Thus, the public policy concerns involved in subrogation where tort claims are at issue-compelling the ultimate payment of a debt by the one who in justice, equity and good conscience should pay it \u2014 did not arise. In contrast, the full extent of the injuries at issue here is not known at this time because full fact-finding has not yet occurred. This case <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>involves the injured party\u2019s insurer and the tortfeasor\u2019s insurer, as well as the tortfeasor himself. Pursuant to our decision in <em>Swanson, </em>it is inappropriate to allow subrogation until Van Orden has been made whole for all of his losses, including the cost of recovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-4\">\u00b637 The majority\u2019s approach to this issue is barred by the doctrine of <em>stare decisis. </em>The majority makes much of the fact that Van Orden \u201chas not demonstrated how he could recover additional amounts directly from the property damage portion of the tortfeasor\u2019s policy.\u201d Opinion, \u00b6 21. If the result will be the same regardless of whether we require that Van Orden be made whole for the full extent of his losses before subrogation can occur, <em>stare decisis </em>suggests we should adhere to the approach set forth in our precedent. <em>See Certain v. Tonn, </em>2009 MT 330, \u00b6 19, 353 Mont. 21, 220 P.3d 384 (\u201cFaced with viable alternatives, <em>stare decisis </em>provides the preferred course.\u201d) (citations and quotation omitted). Indeed, <em>stare decisis </em>suggests we should follow our decisions unless they are \u201cmanifestly wrong.\u201d <em>Allstate v. Wagner-Ellsworth, </em>2008 MT 240, \u00b6 39, 344 Mont. 445, 188 P.3d 1042. Allowing subrogation when Van Orden asserts he has not been made whole disturbs the stability and predictability of the law. <em>See Allstate, </em>\u00b6 39. Instead of arriving at the result our precedent requires, the majority\u2019s approach disregards decades of well-established law in Montana to undermine the made whole doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-5\">\u00b638 Even if our well-settled precedent did not preclude the majority\u2019s approach, the balance of equities favors Van Orden because he asserts he has not been made whole for the full extent of his losses. As a matter of policy, subrogation in the tort context has, essentially, three main purposes: (1) to prevent unjust enrichment of the tortfeasor; (2) to deter future actors from engaging in similar torts; (3) to prevent unjust enrichment of the injured party with respect to the insurer. Maher &amp; Pathak, 40 Loy. U. Chi. L.J. at 55. The first two are served simply by allowing an injured party to recover from the tortfeasor or the tortfeasor\u2019s insurer. At issue here is the third. Common arguments for allowing an insurance company to subrogate amounts recovered from a tortfeasor are that the injured party is \u201cdouble recovering\u201d or is recovering a \u201cwindfall.\u201d <em>See </em>Munro, Trial Trends at 16; Maher &amp; Pathak, 40 Loy. U. Chi. L. J. at 57-59,</p>\n<p id=\"b103-6\">\u00b639 We have explained that no double recovery or windfall can occur unless and until the injured person has been fully made whole for the full extent of his losses. <em>See Swanson, </em>\u00b6 22 (\u201cduplicate payments do not occur until the insured has been made whole for all losses, as well as costs of recovery.\u201d). In addition, both the \u201cdouble recovery\u201d and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>\u201cwindfall\u201d arguments \u2014 though initially attractive through their appeal to a sense of fundamental fairness \u2014 suffer from fatal flaws.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-4\">\u00b640 The \u201cdouble recovery\u201d argument is premised on an assumption that the injured party is only entitled to <em>either </em>proceeds from the insurance policy the party has paid for <em>or </em>to recover from a tortfeasor. In fact, as we explained in DeTienne:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b104-5\">The insurer cannot assert any claim by way of subrogation unless the insured has a claim against the third person to which the insurer can be subrogated for the reason that the subrogated insurer stands in no better position than the insured, and cannot recover over against the wrongdoer unless the insured could have done so, for if the insured had no right of action against the wrongdoer none can pass to the insurer by way of subrogation.... <em>Otherwise stated, subrogation by definition and of necessity presupposes the existence of a right of the insured against some third person or fund </em>....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b104-6\"><em>DeTienne, </em>266 Mont. at 189, 879 P.2d at 707 (quoting G.Couch &amp; R.Anderson, 16 <em>Couch Cyclopedia of Insurance Law, </em>Subrogation, \u00a7 61:114, 183-84 (1983)) (emphasis added). In subrogation, the insured injured party surrenders damages to which he is entitled to reimburse his insurance company for benefits he has paid a premium to receive. In reality, it is the insurance company seeking subrogation that is, potentially, unjustly enriched, if the injured person has not been made whole for the losses caused by the tortfeasor. <em>See DeTienne, </em>266 Mont. at 192, 879 P.2d at 709 (a situation in which the insured loses money \u2014 for instance, paid for litigation of excessive damage, plus premiums paid to the insurer \u2014 is akin to unjust enrichment and is not equitable). To ensure that the injured party is made whole, and to discourage the possibility that the company might be unjustly enriched vis-a-vis the injured party, we have always required that the injured party be ftdly made whole before any subrogation can occur. <em>See Swanson, </em>\u00b6 28. Here, there is no danger of double-recovery at this time because Van Orden has not been made whole for all his losses, including costs of recovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-7\">\u00b641 The windfall argument also fails pursuant to the rule from <em>Swanson. </em>In addition, however, insurance companies often will have adjusted premiums to account for subrogation recoveries, or lack thereof. Where that has occurred there is no \u201cwindfall\u201d to the insured, because the insured implicitly paid higher premiums for the right to keep tort proceeds. Maher &amp; Pathak, 40 Loy. U. Chi. L. J. at 58. It is not clear what USAA\u2019s practice is in this regard \u2014 which is precisely <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>why further fact-finding is needed to address Van Orden\u2019s contention that he has not been made whole.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-4\">\u00b642 I would adhere to the approach to this issue set forth in our precedent. I am not asserting that Van Orden would be entitled to the Alpha Policy\u2019s property damage coverage to pay for losses for which his USAA insurance policy had already reimbursed him. To me, the process is simple. When a person is injured through no fault of his own, all available insurance coverage proceeds, from whatever source, go into one pot. Only <em>after </em>the injured person is made whole for the full extent of the damages he has suffered may the insurance company take anything from that pot. The purpose of this approach is to ensure that the primary concern in any case where the insurer seeks to subrogate is the insured being made whole for the full extent of his losses \u2014 not merely for discrete elements of damages. In Van Orden\u2019s case, this means that while he may not be able to recover additional amounts from the Alpha Policy to compensate him for his property damage, funds from that policy may be available to help cover his attorney\u2019s fees, for instance. I do not concede that Van Orden could not recover directly from the tortfeasor\u2019s policy any more than he already recovered from USAA \u2014 it is impossible to determine whether that is true when Van Orden still asserts he has not been made whole.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-5\">\u00b643 The majority Opinion will now allow insurance companies to seek subrogation before the injured person has been made whole. I fear that this Opinion represents an incremental shift away from a state of law in which \u201cthe insured\u2019s interests are the primary concern,\u201d DeTienne, 266 Mont. at 190, 879 P.2d at 708, and towards one in which the Court will protect the financial interests of the insurance company to the detriment of the injured person.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
