In March 2012, C.S. turned eighteen. Shortly after, he ran away from his biological mother\u2019s home. After a determination by the Montana Department of Public Health and Human Services (DPHHS) that foster care was in C.S.\u2019s best interests, DPHHS placed C.S. with S.M. (Foster Father) for foster care services. C.S. previously had resided with Foster Father at times prior to this placement.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-11\">\u00b69 Following attempts to work with the School District to improve C.S.\u2019s education, Foster Father filed a complaint on behalf of C.S. with the Montana Office of Public Instruction (OPI) in November 2012. The complaint alleged that the School District violated both federal education law under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) and Montana\u2019s special education laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-12\">\u00b610 OPI\u2019s investigation revealed numerous violations of IDEA, which it included in its final report issued on January 25, 2013. The investigation also raised concerns about C.S.\u2019s ability to make his own educational decisions. OPI stated that, pursuant to federal regulations, an \u201cappropriate individual to represent the educational interests of [C.S.] throughout the period of the child\u2019s eligibility under IDEA should be appointed if [he] has reached age of majority, has not been determined to be incompetent, and is determined not to have the ability to provide informed consent with respect to [his] educational program.\u201d OPI noted that Montana law does not have a process for appointment of a surrogate parent for those students who have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>reached the age of majority. It directed the School District to the Montana surrogate parent statute for minor children, and ordered the School District to \u201cpromptly attempt to obtain appointment of a surrogate parent, or other judicial appointment for educational purposes, for [C.S.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b317-5\">\u00b611 On behalf of the School District, the Butte-Silver Bow County Attorney filed a request with the District Court for the appointment of a surrogate parent for C.S. on February 20, 2013. The petition requested the appointment of Mary Jo Mahoney. The School District did not serve the petition on C.S. or his Foster Father. On February 25, 2013, the District Court ordered the appointment ofMahoney as C.S.\u2019s surrogate parent. C.S. learned about the appointment when Mahoney attended his individualized education plan (IEP) meeting. Mahoney approved the School District\u2019s proposed IEP for C.S. that long had been disputed by C.S.\u2019s Foster Father and attorney. On March 13,2013, C.S. filed a motion to vacate the appointment ofMahoney and to substitute Foster Father as his surrogate parent. The court denied the request in an order dated June 10, 2013, reasoning that a foster parent \u201chas no statutory preference or priority for appointment as a surrogate parent in the absence of a parent or legal guardian.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b317-6\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b317-7\">\u00b612 We review a District Court\u2019s conclusions of law for correctness. <em>Stewart v. </em>Rice, 2013 MT 55, \u00b6 15, 369 Mont. 203, 296 P.3d 1174. Our review of constitutional questions, such as an alleged violation of due process, is plenary. <em>Stewart, </em>\u00b6 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b317-9\">\u00b613 2. <em>Whether C.S.\u2019s claims are moot.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b317-10\">\u00b614 The School District argues that C.S.\u2019s claims are moot because, as of June 2013, he \u201caged out\u201d of the school system and is no longer eligible for education services. C.S. concedes that he is \u201caged out\u201d of school. He maintains, however, that he has an ongoing interest in the outcome of this case because he is pursuing a separate due process claim against the School District. In that claim, he seeks education to compensate for the School District\u2019s failure to provide him with a free appropriate public education (FAPE) as required by IDEA. Thus, he argues that the court\u2019s appointment ofMahoney is still a five issue.</p>\n<p id=\"AWgl\">\u00b615 Because this Cotut cannot address a moot question, mootness is a threshold issue that we must resolve before addressing the merits of a case. <em>Havre Daily News, LLC v. City of Havre, </em>2006 MT 215, \u00b6 31, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>333 Mont. 331, 142 P.2d 864. A moot question is a question that \u201cexisted once but because of an event or happening ... has ceased to exist and no longer presents an actual controversy.\u201d <em>Serena Vista, LLC v. State Dept. of Nat. Resources &amp; </em>Conserv., 2008 MT 65, \u00b6 14, 342 Mont. 73, 179 P.3d 510 (internal citation omitted). An appeal may become moot \u201cwhere by a change of circumstances prior to the appellate decision the case has lost any practical purpose for the parties, for instance where the grievance that gave rise to the case has been eliminated.\u201d <em>In re </em>T.J.F., 229 Mont. 473, 475, 747 P.2d 1356, 1357 (1987) (internal citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b318-4\">\u00b616 IDEA vests courts with broad authority to grant \u201csuch relief as the court determines is appropriate.\u201d 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415(i)(2)(C)(iii). One form of relief courts grant under IDEA is compensatory education, which requires a school district to compensate for its past failure to provide a FAPE. \u201cAppropriate relief is relief designed to ensure that the student is appropriately educated within the meaning of the IDEA.\u201d <em>Parents of Student W. v. Puyallup Sch. Dist., </em>31 F.3d 1489, 1497 (9th Cir. 1994). Such relief may be granted even to students who already have \u201caged out\u201d of school. <em>See Phil v. Mass. Dept. of Educ., </em>9 F.3d 184, 190 (1st Cir. 1993) (If the claimant could \u201cprove that the school district denied him his right to an appropriate education under the IDEA ... he could claim relief in the form of compensatory education, notwithstanding the fact that he is now twenty-seven years old.\u201d); <em>Ferren C. v. Sch. Dist. of Phila., </em>612 F.3d 712, 717-18, 720 (3d Cir. 2010) (Although IDEA limits a school district\u2019s obligation to provide a FAPE, individuals over the statutory age limit still may be eligible for compensatory education if the school district failed to provide a FAPE prior to the student aging out.).</p>\n<p id=\"b318-5\">\u00b617 Although C.S. no longer qualifies for special education services from the School District, he maintains an interest in the outcome of this proceeding. His due process complaint is still pending at the administrative level. If successful in that proceeding, C.S. may receive an award of education services and return to the School District. Because Mahoney\u2019s position as a surrogate parent vests her with broad authority to \u201crepresent [C.S.] in all decisionmaking processes concerning [his] education,\u201d her appointment impacts C.S.\u2019s future education possibilities. Section 20-7-462, MCA. This action has not \u201clost all practical purpose for the parties,\u201d and we conclude that the court\u2019s refusal to vacate its appointment of Mahoney has not been mooted.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-6\">\u00b618 <em>2. Whether the appointment of Mahoney violated C.S.\u2019s </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number><em>constitutional rights.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b319-5\">\u00b619 C.S. asserts that the School District\u2019s petition and the District Court\u2019s order appointing Mahoney without notice implicated his constitutional rights to due process, privacy, dignity, and education. The School District argues that C.S. failed to raise this issue below. In his motion to the District Court, C.S. did argue that the School District failed to serve its petition to appoint a surrogate parent, but he did not raise a constitutional argument until appeal. He now argues that we should exercise plain error review of these claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-6\">\u00b620 We generally do not review issues raised for the first time on appeal. <em>Stewart, </em>\u00b6 16. We may, however, review \u201ca claimed error not previously raised in the district court [that] affects fundamental constitutional rights where failing to review it may result in a manifest miscarriage of justice, leave unsettled the question of the fundamental fairness of the proceedings, or compromise the integrity of the judicial process.\u201d <em>Stewart, </em>\u00b6 16 (internal citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b319-7\">\u00b621 Although C.S. did not receive notice of the School District\u2019s petition or the District Court\u2019s appointment, the court allowed him to argue for the removal of Mahoney and issued a ruling on the merits of that issue. That issue is now before us on appeal. C.S. fails to demonstrate how the lack of notice below affected his substantial rights in such a way that our failure to review it would result in injustice. Given that we are reviewing the merits of his original claim, we disagree that failure to exercise plain error review of C.S.\u2019s constitutional argument would result in injustice. We therefore decline to consider his constitutional claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-8\">\u00b622 <em>3. Whether the District Court erred in denying C.S.\u2019s motion to vacate the appointment of Mahoney and substitute his foster parent as C.S.\u2019s surrogate parent.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b319-9\">\u00b623 Montana is bound by IDEA because of the State\u2019s receipt of federal funding under the law. 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415(a). The Montana Superintendent of Public Instruction is expressly charged with promulgating regulations that \u201censur[e] that the requirements of [IDEA] are met....\u201d Section 20-7-403(11), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-10\">\u00b624 IDEA requires states to appoint an available parent as a surrogate for an adult student with disabilities before turning to another individual. The law reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b319-11\">If, under State law, a child with a disability who [sic] has reached the age of majority under State law, who has not been determined to be incompetent, but who is determined not to have the ability to provide informed consent with respect to the educational <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>program of the child, the State shall establish procedures for appointing the parent of the child, or if the parent is not available, another appropriate individual, to represent the educational interest of the child throughout the period of eligibility of the child under this subchapter.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b320-4\">20 XJ.S.C. \u00a7 1415(m)(2). Montana law does not outline a procedure for appointing a surrogate for an adult student with disabilities, but \u00a7 20-7-461, MCA, directs a school district providing education to a child with a disability to \u201cadopt procedures to assign an individual to act as a surrogate parent for a child with a disability whenever the parents or guardian cannot be identified or, after reasonable efforts, the location of the parents cannot be discovered or if the child is a ward of the state.\u201d Both laws have a threshold requirement that a parent be unavailable before another individual is appointed.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-5\">\u00b625 IDEA\u2019S definition of a parent includes \u201ca natural, adoptive, or foster parent of a child (unless a foster parent is prohibited by State law from serving as a parent).\u201d 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1401(23)(A). The administrative rules adopted by OPI incorporate the federal law, stating, \u201cProcedures for the appointment of a surrogate parent shall comply with ... 34 CFR 300.30 ....\u201d Admin. R. M. 10.16.3504(1). That regulation allows a foster parent to act as a parent \u201cunless State law, regulations, or contractual obligations with a State or local entity prohibit a foster parent from acting as a parent.\u201d 34 C.F.R. 300.30. OPI\u2019s administrative rules permit a foster parent to \u201cact as a parent if the natural parents\u2019 authority to make educational decisions on the student\u2019s behalf has been extinguished under state law and the foster parent: (a) is willing to make the educational decisions required of parents under IDEA; and (b) has no interest that would conflict with the interests of the student.\u201d Admin. R. M. 10.16.3504(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b320-6\">\u00b626  The District Court did not look to these definitions or to the regulations, both of which allow a foster parent to act as a parent. Instead, the court relied solely on the language of statutes requiring the appointment of a surrogate parent. The court determined that \u201cthe language of both federal and state statute expressly required the School District to consider appointment of a \u2018parent\u2019 or a \u2018parent or guardian\u2019... the statutes make no mention of a \u2018foster parent.\u2019 \u201d The court erred by not applying the federal statutory definition and the applicable federal and state regulations that permit a foster parent to act as a parent under the surrogate parent statutes. These provisions make clear that a foster parent qualifies as a parent under IDEA and Montana\u2019s special education laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>\u00b627  The dispositive facts are uncontested between the parties. Both parties agree that the appointment of a surrogate parent is necessary because C.S. is unable to provide informed consent about his educational choices. The court found, and it remains undisputed, that C.S.\u2019s biological mother\u2019s rights were extinguished when he turned eighteen and that Foster Father is a licensed foster care provider charged with caring for C.S. The School District does not dispute Foster Father\u2019s willingness to \u201cmake the educational decisions required of parents under IDEA,\u201d nor does it assert that he has an \u201cinterest that would conflict with the interests of the student.\u201d Admin. R. M. 10.16.3504(2). Foster Father qualifies as a parent under the applicable state and federal law. Because IDEA requires an available parent to be appointed as the surrogate parent for an adult student, and there is no dispute that Foster Father qualifies, the court erred when it refused to remove Mahoney and appoint Foster Father. The District Court\u2019s order denying C.S.\u2019s motion to remove Mahoney and appoint Foster Father is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-5\">\u00b628 <em>4. Whether C.S. is entitled to attorney\u2019s fees.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b321-6\">\u00b629  C.S. asks that we direct the District Court to reconsider his request for attorney\u2019s fees. In its order denying C.S.\u2019s motion, the court denied his request for attorney\u2019s fees \u201con tibe basis that he was not the prevailing parly.\u201d IDEA authorizes courts, in their discretion, to award reasonable attorney\u2019s fees to a prevailing party \u201cin any action or proceeding brought under [IDEA].\u201d 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415(i)(3)(m). Because we are reversing the District Court\u2019s decision, C.S. is now the prevailing party. Accordingly, we remand for the court to determine whether an award of attorney's fees is appropriate in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-7\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b321-8\">\u00b630 The District Court\u2019s order denying C.S.\u2019s petition to remove Mahoney and appoint Foster Father as C.S.\u2019s surrogate parent is reversed. We remand the case for the court to enter an order appointing Foster Father as C.S.\u2019s surrogate parent and to consider C.S.\u2019s claim for attorney's fees.</p>\n<judges id=\"b321-9\">JUSTICES WHEAT, COTTER, RICE and McKINNON concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
