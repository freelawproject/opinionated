The issue on appeal is whether the District Court erred in denying Nickerson\u2019s motion. We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-24\">PROCEDURAL AND FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b380-25\">\u00b62 The Flathead County Attorney charged Nickerson with felony burglary by Information on August 9, 2007. The District Court in Flathead County issued a warrant for Nickerson\u2019s arrest that same <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>day. Shortly afterward, Nickerson was arrested on unrelated federal charges. A federal court sentenced him on September 27, 2007, and committed him to a federal correctional institution on November 27, 2007. He is currently in a federal prison in Oregon.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-5\">\u00b63 On August 20,2013, Nickerson filed a pro se motion to dismiss the Flathead County arrest warrant. Nickerson argued that the Flathead County Attorney\u2019s failure to take any action on his pending burglary charge for more than six years violated his Sixth Amendment right to a speedy trial. Nickerson\u2019s motion only explicitly requested dismissal of the warrant, but the record does not confirm whether Nickerson received notice of the Information filed against him. Regardless, it is clear that he also seeks dismissal of the underlying charge that compelled the arrest warrant. <em>First Bank (N.A.)-Billings v. Heidema, </em>219 Mont. 373, 711 P.2d 1384 (1986) (pro se litigants are permitted considerable latitude in proceedings, so long as that latitude does not prejudice the other party).</p>\n<p id=\"b381-6\">\u00b64 He attached to his motion a letter issued by the Federal Bureau of Prisons on September 2,2011. The letter, entitled \u201cDetainer Action Letter,\u201d was addressed to the \u201cKalispell County Sheriff.\u201d The letter indicated that the Bureau of Prisons had received a report of Nickerson\u2019s outstanding warrant and made the following request:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AFvN\">Will you please investigate this report, and advise what disposition, if any, has been made of the case. If subject is wanted by your department and you wish a detainer placed, it will be necessary for you to forward a certified copy of your warrant to us along with a cover letter stating your desire to have it lodged as a detainer. If you have no further interest in the subject, please forward a letter indicating so.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b381-7\">The record does not indicate whether the letter ever received a response. Other than this letter, and Nickerson\u2019s mention of it in his motion, no remarks pertaining to a detainer appear in the District Court record in any document offered by Nickerson. Nickerson\u2019s motion did not mention the Interstate Agreement on Detainers Act (IAD).</p>\n<p id=\"b381-8\">\u00b65 The Flathead County Attorney\u2019s response did not address Nickerson\u2019s Sixth Amendment arguments, but stated that Nickerson had moved for dismissal \u201con the grounds that the State has violated his right to a speedy trial under the provisions of the [IAD].\u201d The brief argued that Nickerson\u2019s motion must be denied because an inmate may invoke the provisions of the IAD only after a detainer is filed. The District Court denied Nickerson\u2019s motion by minute entry and without explanation on September 23,2013.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b382-5\">\u00b66 The denial of a motion to dismiss in a criminal case presents a question of law, which we review de novo. <em>State v. Passmore, </em>2010 MT 34, \u00b6 39, 355 Mont. 187, 225 P.3d 1229. Underlying findings of fact are reviewed under the clearly erroneous standard. <em>Passmore, </em>\u00b6 39.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b382-7\">\u00b67 The IAD was adopted in Montana in 1963, where it is now codified as \u00a7 46-31-101 through \u00a7 46-31-204, MCA. The IAD is a congressionally sanctioned interstate compact within the Compact Clause, U.S. Const., Art. I, \u00a7 10, cl. 3, and thus is a federal law subject to federal construction. <em>Carchman v. Nash, </em>473 U.S. 716, 719, 105 S. Ct. 3401, 3403, 87 L. Ed. 2d 516 (1985) (citing <em>Cuyler v. Adams, </em>449 U.S. 433, 438-42, 101 S. Ct. 703, 707 (1981)). The policy of the IAD is \u201cto encourage the expeditious and orderly disposition of such charges and determination of the proper status of any and all detainers based on untried indictments, informations, or complaints.\u201d Section 46-31-101, MCA; <em>State v. Seadin, </em>181 Mont. 294, 297, 593 P.2d 451, 453 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"ApE\">\u00b68 Article III, Section 1, of the IAD provides that once an inmate has been notified of any detainer, and the inmate has arrived at the designated institution, the inmate may request the timely disposition of the charges for which the detainer was issued. The 180-day \u201cspeedy trial\u201d provision specifically refers to \u201cany untried indictment, information, or complaint on the basis of which a detainer has been lodged against the prisoner....\u201d Section 46-31-101, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-8\">\u00b69 The State correctly argues on appeal that Nickerson cannot avail himself of this provision because the Flathead County Attorney has not filed a detainer against Nickerson. The provisions of the IAD bind the \u201creceiving\u201d state only after a detainer has been filed. <em>Seadin, </em>181 Mont. at 297, 593 P.2d at 453. \u201c[T]he provisions of the Agreement are triggered only when a \u2018detainer\u2019 is filed with the custodial (sending) State by another State (receiving) having untried charges pending against the prisoner.\u201d <em>U.S. v. Mauro, </em>436 U.S. 340, 343-44, 98 S. Ct. 1834, 1839, 56 L. Ed. 2d 329 (1978); <em>Seadin, </em>181 Mont. at 297, 593 P.2d at 453.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-9\">\u00b610 Nickerson\u2019s motion in the District Court, however, was premised on an alleged denial of his constitutional right to a speedy trial \u2014 not the IAD. He argues again on appeal that the State has unfairly delayed his prosecution for over six years, citing cases discussing the Sixth Amendment right to a speedy trial. He argues that his ability to defend against the burglary charge has been impeded \u201cby not bringing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>the Defendant to trial under the speedy trial laws of the State of Montana, the right to [a] speedy trial under the Constitution of the State of Montana, and the Sixth and Fourttenth [sic] Amendments of the United States.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b383-5\">\u00b611 It is clear that Nickerson never intended to invoke the IAD. He admits in his brief on appeal that he was \u201ctotally aware\u201d that the IAD does not apply until a detainer is filed with the federal prison where he is currently incarcerated. He refers to the State\u2019s assertion that he moved to have his charge dismissed based on a violation of the IAD as a \u201cblatant he.\u201d Yet the State\u2019s appellate response brief, like the Flathead County Attorney\u2019s response to the District Court, fails to acknowledge Nickerson\u2019s Sixth Amendment claim. The brief claims that Nickerson \u201cfiled a motion to dismiss the charge on speedy trial grounds under the [IAD].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b383-6\">\u00b612 A petitioner\u2019s confinement in a federal prison does not absolve the State\u2019s duty under the constitutional guarantee. <em>Smith v. Hooey, </em>393 U.S. 374, 377, 89 S. Ct. 575, 577, 21 L. Ed. 2d 60 (1969). The constitutional right to a speedy trial is distinct from the right to a speedy trial under the IAD. A holding that the IAD does not apply in a particular case does not \u201cclose the inquiry\u201d on speedy trial rights. <em>See Tinghitella v. Calif., </em>718 F.2d 308, 312 (9th Cir. 1983). Even where the IAD does not apply, a prisoner \u201chas a constitutional right under the Sixth Amendment and the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to have the ... prosecution completed by imposition of sentence within a reasonable time.\u201d <em>Tinghitella, </em>718 F.2d at 312 (citing <em>Smith, </em>393 U.S. 374, 89 S. Ct. 575). \u201cSome of [the speedy trial] factors may carry quite different weight where a defendant is incarcerated after conviction in another State, but no court should overlook the possible impact pending charges might have on his prospects for parole and meaningful rehabilitation.\u201d <em>Moore v. Ariz., </em>414 U.S. 25, 27, 94 S. Ct. 188, 190, 38 L. Ed. 2d 183 (1973) (citing <em>Strunk v. U.S., </em>412 U.S. 434, 439, 93 S. Ct. 2260, 2263, 37 L. Ed. 2d 56 (1973)).</p>\n<p id=\"b383-7\">\u00b613  We hold that the District Court improperly denied Nickerson\u2019s motion without addressing his speedy trial rights. We reverse and remand for consideration of Nickerson\u2019s constitutional speedy trial claim in accordance with the factors set forth in <em>State v. Ariegwe, </em>2007 MT 204, 338 Mont. 442, 167 P.3d 815.</p>\n<judges id=\"b383-8\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES WHEAT, McKINNON and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
