We reverse, and restate the issue raised by Macy as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"AlJ\">\u00b62 <em>Did the District Court err by ordering Macy to pay restitution to the State for expenses incurred in extraditing him from Idaho to Montana?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b35-4\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b35-5\">\u00b63 Macy was convicted of four felonies during2007 and 2008. During his incarceration for these offenses, Macy was transferred between multiple correctional facilities and pre-release centers. On October 1, 2010, Macy was sent to a pre-release center in Helena, but, within hours of arriving, he absconded and did not return.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-6\">\u00b64 Several months later, on February 7, 2011, law enforcement officers stopped a Jeep for speeding in Kootenai County, Idaho. The vehicle was driven by Macy, and Mac/s wife was a passenger. Fearing a return to prison, Macy led Idaho law enforcement on a high-speed chase, which ended when Macy collided with a Highway Patrol vehicle and law enforcement fired over a dozen shots into Maty\u2019s Jeep, wounding Macy and killing his wife. Macy was treated and taken into custody in Idaho, and subsequently extradited to Montana.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-7\">\u00b65 Macy was charged with escape, a felony pursuant to \u00a7 45-7-306(2), MCA. Maty pled guilty, admitting that he \u201cwalked away from prerelease without the proper authorization.\u201d The District Court sentenced Macy to ten years in the Montana State Prison, with two years suspended. The District Court also ordered Macy to pay restitution to the State in the amount of $694.50 for the costs incurred in extraditing him back to Montana from Idaho. The District Court based this figure on a document entitled \u201cMSP Trip Estimate for Interstate Transfer,\u201d which was included in the Presentence Investigation Report. On appeal, Macy challenges this restitution requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-8\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b35-9\">\u00b66 Pursuant to \u00a7 46-18-201(5), MCA, if a person has been found guilty of an offense, and the sentencing court finds that a \u201cvictim\u201d has sustained a \u201cpecuniary loss,\u201d as the terms are defined in \u00a7 46-18-243, MCA, the sentencing court shall require payment of frill restitution to the \u201cvictim.\u201d <em>State v. Brothers, </em>2013 MT 222, \u00b6 8, 371 Mont. 254, 307 P.3d 306 (citation omitted). This determination constitutes a mixed question of law and fact. <em>Brothers, </em>\u00b6 8. We will not disturb a court\u2019s factual findings unless they are clearly erroneous. We review de novo whether those facts satisfy the applicable legal standard and whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>the court has statutory authority to impose the sentence. <em>Brothers, </em>\u00b6 9 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b36-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b36-5\">\u00b67 <em>Did the District Court err hy ordering Macy to pay restitution to the State for expenses incurred in extraditing him from Idaho to </em>Montana?</p>\n<p id=\"b36-6\">\u00b68 For purposes of restitution, a \u201cvictim,\u201d as defined by Montana law, includes \u201ca governmental entity that suffers loss of property asa result of the commission of an offense in this state or that incurs costs or losses during the commission or investigation of an escape... or <em>during the apprehension or attempted apprehension of the escapee.\u201d </em>Section 46-18-243(2)(iii), MCA (emphasis added). This statute has been interpreted by this Court \u201cto include a governmental entity <em>only </em>when that entity suffers property damage in the commission of a crime, or <em>incurs costs in the investigation or apprehension of an escaped person.\u201d State v. Jay, </em>2013 MT 79, \u00b6 48, 369 Mont. 332, 298 P.3d 396 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b36-7\">\u00b69 Macy argues that the expense of extraditing him from Idaho to Montana was \u201cnot the result of property damage suffered during the commission of a crime or the investigation or apprehension of an escapee.\u201d He asserts that \u201cthe State of Idaho, not Montana, apprehended Macy,\u201d and, therefore, the State is not a \u201cvictim\u201d entitled to restitution as defined by the statute, and consistent with our decision in <em>Brothers. </em>The State answers that when Macy left the prerelease center, \u201che created a need for the State to incur expenses to return him to Montana.\u201d Therefore, according to the State, \u201cthe cost of apprehending [Macy] included the cost of extraditing him back to Montana.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b36-8\">\u00b610 In <em>Brothers, </em>Brothers was charged with several sexual crimes for which the district court issued a warrant for his arrest. Law enforcement subsequently apprehended Brothers in New Mexico and extradited him back to Montana. <em>Brothers, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 4-5. After he pled guilty to sexual assault, Brothers was ordered by the district court to pay restitution to the State for the costs incurred during his extradition. <em>Brothers, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 4,7. On appeal, we determined that \u201cthe [district [c]ourt lacked the authority to impose restitution because the State [was] not a \u2018victim\u2019 as required by \u00a7 46-18-201(5), MCA, and defined in \u00a7 46-18-243(2)(a), MCA <em>\"Brothers, </em>\u00b6 10. We reasoned that extradition costs are distinct from \u201cproperty damage suffered during the commission of a crime or of the investigation or apprehension of an escapee\u201d and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>therefore are not recoverable as restitution. <em>Brothers, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 12-13.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-5\">\u00b611 The State attempts to distinguish <em>Brothers </em>on the ground that \u201cthe defendant in that case was not an escapee.\u201d While the State is technically correct on this point, we agree with Macy that the relevant inquiry under \u00a7 46-18-243(2)(a)(iii), MCA, for this case is whether the State incurred costs during \u201cthe apprehension or attempted apprehension of the escapee.\u201d It is \u201cwell established that a district court\u2019s authority to impose sentences in criminal cases is defined and constrained by statute.... [Restitution is statutorily limited to the \u2018victim\u2019 of the crime for which a defendant is convicted.\u201d <em>State v. Setters, </em>2001 MT 101, \u00b6\u00b6 21-22, 305 Mont. 253, 25 P.3d 893 (citations omitted), <em>overruled on other grounds, State v. Herman, </em>2008 MT 187, \u00b6 12 n. 1, 343 Mont. 494, 188 P.3d 978. When interpreting a statute, \u201c[t]he statute\u2019s plain language controls our interpretation if we can discern the legislative intent from the plain meaning of the statute\u2019s words.\u201d <em>State v. Merry, </em>2008 MT 288, \u00b6 12, 345 Mont. 390, 191 P.3d 428. \u201c[W]e refuse to insert \u201cwhat has been omitted or to omit what has been inserted.\u2019 \u201d <em>Merry, </em>\u00b6 12 (citing \u00a7 1-2-101, MCA).</p>\n<p id=\"b37-6\">\u00b612  Black\u2019s Law Dictionary defines \u201capprehension\u201d as \u201c[t]he seizure, taking, or arrest of a person on a criminal charge.\u201d <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>101 (6th ed., West 1990). Consistent with the plain language of \u00a7 46-18-243(2)(a)(iii), MCA, it was the State of Idaho, not Montana, that \u201capprehended\u201d Macy following the high-speed chase in Kootenai County, Idaho, by seizing and arresting him. The statute does not include the separate cost of extraditing Macy back to the State of Montana as a recoverable item, and, consistent with our decision in <em>Brothers, </em>the District Court was without statutory authority to impose this cost as restitution. The Legislature may wish to revise \u00a7 46-18-243(2)(a)(iii), MCA, to permit recovery of this cost by the State, but we will not insert such language into the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-7\">\u00b613 Macy also argues that the order requiring repayment of the extradition costs was improper because it was not based on an affidavit or sworn testimony as required by \u00a7 46-18-242, MCA. Having already determined that the District Court lacked statutory authority to impose restitution for extradition costs, we decline to address this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-8\">\u00b614 Reversed and remanded for entry of an amended judgment consistent herewith.</p>\n<judges id=\"b37-9\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES COTTER, McKINNON and WHEAT concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
