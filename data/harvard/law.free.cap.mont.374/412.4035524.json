Did the District Court err by affirming the Municipal Courts determination that law enforcement properly withdrew Giacomini\u2019s blood against his will after obtaining a valid search warrant?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b439-6\">\u00b63 <em>2. Did the District Court err by affirming the Municipal Courts decision to deny Giacomini\u2019s \u201cRequest for Hearing\u201d as untimely?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b439-7\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b439-8\">\u00b64 On May 9, 2012, at 2:27 a.m., Officer Sean Weston (Officer Weston) of the Billings Police Department observed Giacomini driving westbound on an eastbound, one-way street. After initiating a traffic stop, Officer Weston noticed that Giacomini had watery, blood-shot eyes and smelled of alcohol. Officer Weston engaged him in a series of field sobriety tests, which indicated a likelihood of impairment. When Officer Weston asked Giacomini to provide a preliminary breath sample, he refused. Officer Weston then arrested Giacomini and transported him to the Yellowstone County Detention Facility (YCDF) for further testing.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-9\">\u00b65 At the YCDF, Giacomini again performed poorly on field sobriety tests and again refused to provide a breath sample. A search of his driving records revealed that he had previously refused to provide a breath sample on November 12,1990. Officer Weston contacted the Honorable Russell C. Fagg (Judge Fagg) via telephone in order to obtain a search warrant authorizing withdrawal of a sample of Giacomini\u2019s blood. The following conversation took place under oath:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ArF3\">[Officer Weston:] Judge, I have probable cause to believe that there is now in the body, blood or bodily fluid of Joseph Giacomini ... alcohol and, or drugs; that together with the evidence constitutes the crime of Driving Under the Influence of Alcohol or drugs .... Mr. Giacomini was observed driving westbound in the twenty seven hundred block of Montana, which is a one way street that travels eastbound. Ahm, the following observations of symptoms and, or impairment were made of Mr. Giacomini by myself. Ahm, he had watery bloodshot eyes. He had a faint odor of a-, ahm, alcoholic beverage on his person. Ahm, he, ahm, was often swaying or staggering and couldn\u2019t, had ahm, difficulty keeping his balance. Ahm, throughout the course of the, ahm, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>S.F.S.T.\u2019s, I observed six out of six possible clues on the H.G.N., four out of eight possible clues on the walk and turn. And, on the one leg stand I observed three clues and indicating impairment. Ahm, he refused a P.B.T. test, as well as an intoxilyzer test.... I believe there is an immediate need to obtain this evidence in a timely manner because, based on my training and experience, alcohol and, or drug concentration in the body change and are completely eliminated from the body simply with the passage of time. Therefore, the evidence is perishable in nature and a time delay would render it useless. Based on the preceding facts, I am seeking a Telephonic Search Warrant. This concludes my affidavit, Your Honor. Do I have your permission to sign you[r] name to this affidavit and search warrant and then execute the search warrant?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b440-4\">[Judge Fagg:] Yes you do. I believe you have, ahm, probable cause to execute the search warrant. So, you may do so.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b440-5\">Pursuant to the warrant, YCDF personnel attempted to draw a blood sample from Giacomini. He became argumentative and had to be placed in a restraint chair. Law enforcement videotaped the entire process. Eventually a blood sample was obtained and sent to the Montana State Crime Lab, where subsequent testing established that Giacomini\u2019s blood alcohol content (BAG) was 0.12. Accordingly, the State charged Giacomini with DUI under \u00a7 61-8-401(l)(a), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-6\">\u00b66 After an omnibus hearing, Giacomini moved to suppress the results of the blood test, arguing that the act of drawing his blood violated the Montana Constitution and was not supported by probable cause. The Municipal Court orally denied his motion on September 24, 2012, and issued its written Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law and Order on October 1,2012. The court determined that law enforcement did not violate Giacomini\u2019s constitutional right of privacy and acted pursuant to a valid search warrant. On November 7,2012, Giacomini filed a motion entitled \u201cRequest for Hearing,\u201d which asked the Municipal Court to reconsider the suppression issue in light of video evidence showing that YCDF personnel \u201ccontinually stuck\u201d him with needles. The court denied the motion as untimely. Giacomini then entered a plea of nolo contendere, reserving the suppression issues for appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-7\">\u00b67 Giacomini filed a notice of appeal with the Thirteenth Judicial District Court. After receiving the parties\u2019 briefing, the District Court affirmed the Municipal Court\u2019s rulings. Giacomini appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b441-5\">\u00b68 When reviewing a Municipal Court\u2019s decision, a district court functions as an intermediate appellate court. <em>City of Bozeman v. Cantu, </em>2013 MT 40, \u00b6 10, 369 Mont. 81, 296 P.3d 461 (citing \u00a7\u00a7 3-5-303, 3-6-110, MCA). In this capacity, a district court is limited to a \u201creview of the record and questions of law.\u201d Section 3-6-110(1), MCA. \u201cOur ultimate determination is whether the district court, in its review of the trial court\u2019s decision, reached the correct conclusions under the appropriate standards of review.\u201d <em>Stanley v. Lemire, </em>2006 MT 304, \u00b6 26, 334 Mont. 489, 148 P.3d 643. When evidence gathered pursuant to a search warrant is subject to a motion to suppress, \u201cthis Court\u2019s function as a reviewing court is to ensure that the court issuing the search warrant had a substantial basis to determine probable cause existed.\u201d <em>State v. St. Marks, </em>2002 MT 285, \u00b6 12, 312 Mont. 468, 59 P.3d 1113 (citations omitted). A trial court\u2019s determination that a motion to suppress is untimely is a conclusion of law that we review for correctness. <em>State v. Greywater, </em>282 Mont. 28, 36, 939 P.2d 975, 980 (1997) (citation omitted). We exercise plenary review over questions of constitutional law. <em>State v. Daniels, </em>2011 MT 278, \u00b6 11, 362 Mont. 426, 265 P.3d 623 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b441-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b441-7\">\u00b69 <em>1. Did the District Court err by affirming the Municipal Court\u2019s determination that law enforcement properly withdrew Giacomini\u2019s blood against his will after obtaining a valid search warrant?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b441-8\">\u00b610 Montana\u2019s implied consent statute provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b441-9\">(1) A person who operates or is in actual physical control of a vehicle upon ways of this state open to the public is considered to have given consent to a test or tests of the person\u2019s blood or breath for the purpose of determining any measured amount or detected presence of alcohol or drugs in the person\u2019s body.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b441-10\">(4) If an arrested person refuses to submit to one or more tests requested and designated by the officer as provided in subsection</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b441-11\">(2) , the refused test or tests may not be given except as provided in subsection (5)....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b441-12\"><em>(5) If the arrested person has refused to provide a breath, blood, or urine sample under 61-8-409 or this section in a prior investigation in this state </em>or under a substantially similar statute in another jurisdiction or the arrested person has a prior conviction or pending offense for a violation of45-5-104,45-5-106, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>45-5-205, 61-8-401, 61-8-406, or 61-8-411 or a similar statute in another jurisdiction, <em>the officer may apply for a search warrant to be issued pursuant to 46-5-224 to collect a sample of the person\u2019s blood for testing.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b442-4\">Section 61-8-402, MCA (emphasis added). Blood samples drawn in violation of \u00a7 61-8-402, MCA, are inadmissible to prove DUI. <em>State v. Thompson, </em>207 Mont. 433, 435, 674 P.2d 1094, 1095 (1984) (citation omitted). Prior to 2011, this statute did not permit law enforcement to apply for a search warrant in DUI cases if an arrested person refused to submit to BAC testing. <em>See </em>\u00a7 61-8-402, MCA (2009) (\u201cIf an arrested person refuses to submit to one or more tests requested and designated by the officer... the refused test or tests may not be given....\u201d). Ablood sample could be taken pursuant to a search warrant in cases where law enforcement had \u201cprobable cause to believe that an offense other than the underlying DUI ha[d] occurred.\u201d <em>Collins v. Dept. of Just., Div. of Hwy. Patrol, </em>232 Mont. 73, 78, 755 P.2d 1373, 1376 (1988); <em>see Thompson, </em>207 Mont. at 436-39, 674 P.2d at 1096-97 (holding that evidence obtained from a nonconsensual blood draw was admissible to prove negligent homicide). However, the statutory framework was revised in 2011 by the Legislature\u2019s passage of Senate Bill 42. Senate Bill 42 added subsection (5) to \u00a7 61-8-402, MCA, quoted above, which authorized law enforcement to apply for a search warrant for a blood draw in cases where an arrested person has previously refused to provide a BAC sample. Laws of Mont., 2011, ch. 283, \u00a7 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-5\">A. Probable Cause</p>\n<p id=\"b442-6\">\u00b611 Giacomini begins his argument by challenging the search warrant authorizing the blood draw as unsupported by probable cause. Montana law provides for issuance of a search warrant when a law enforcement officer, under oath or affirmation, and in writing or by telephone:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-7\">(1) states facts sufficient to support probable cause to believe that an offense has been committed;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-8\">(2) states facts sufficient to support probable cause to believe that evidence, contraband, or persons connected with the offense may be found;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-9\">(3) particularly describes the place, object, or persons to be searched; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-10\">(4) particularly describes who or what is to be seized.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b442-11\">Section 46-5-221, MCA. When evaluating whether probable cause exists to support the issuance of a search warrant, this Court applies the \u201ctotality of the circumstances\u201d test set forth in <em>Illinois v. Gates, </em>462 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>U.S. 213, 103 S. Ct. 2317, 76 L. Ed. 2d 527 (1983). <em>State v. Tucker, </em>2008 MT 273, \u00b6 16, 345 Mont. 237, 190 P.3d 1080. Under this test, \u201cthe issuing judicial officer must make a practical, common sense determination, given all the evidence contained in the application for a search warrant, whether a fair probability exists that contraband or evidence of a crime will be found in a particular place.\u201d <em>Tucker, </em>\u00b6 16 (citations omitted). Probable cause does not require facts sufficient to establish that criminal activity has occurred, only that there exists a probability of criminal activity. <em>State v. Barnaby, </em>2006 MT 203, \u00b6 30, 333 Mont. 220, 142 P.3d 809. We pay great deference to a magistrate\u2019s determination that probable cause exists to issue a search warrant, and we \u201cdraw all reasonable inferences possible to support the issuing magistrate\u2019s determination of probable cause.\u201d <em>State v. Cotterell, </em>2008 MT 409, \u00b6 59, 347 Mont. 231, 198 P.3d 254 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b443-4\">\u00b612 Giacomini argues that his prior refusal of a breath test is insufficient to establish probable cause to support a search warrant to draw his blood. Noting the change to \u00a7 61-8-402, MCA, in 2011, he argues that \u201c[t]he legislature did not and cannot establish probable cause,\u201d but that \u201cjudges in the state have taken that to mean that if there has been a prior conviction, or a prior breath test refusal that is probable cause to issue a search warrant.\u201d The State responds that Giacomini \u201cappears to conflate the statutory authority granted to law enforcement officers] to <em>apply </em>for a search warrant with the statutory requirements of a judge to <em>issue </em>a search warrant.\u201d (Emphasis in original.)</p>\n<p id=\"b443-5\">\u00b613 We agree with the State. The revisions made to \u00a7 61-8-402, MCA, by Senate Bill 42 merely removed the statutory prohibition on seeking a search warrant for a blood draw in those cases where the arrested person has previously refused a test.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>See </em>\u00a7 61-8-402(5), MCA (2011) (If the arrested person has previously refused to provide a sample, then \u201cthe officer <em>may apply </em>for a search warrant to be issued pursuant to 46-5-224 to collect a sample of the person\u2019s blood for testing\u201d) (emphasis added). An arrested person\u2019s prior refusal does not itself establish the necessary probable cause for a warrant, but merely permits police to apply for a warrant, for which they must demonstrate probable cause. Here, there was a substantial basis for Judge Fagg\u2019s determination that probable cause existed to authorize a draw of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>Giacomini\u2019s blood. Under oath, Officer Weston informed Judge Fagg that Giacomini: (1) had driven the wrong way down a one way-street, (2) had watery, bloodshot eyes, (3) smelled of alcohol, (4) swayed and staggered, and (5) performed poorly on standard field sobriety tests. Applying the totality of the circumstances test, Judge Fagg had an ample basis to believe that a probability existed that criminal activity (DUI) had occurred, and that evidence of the crime would be found in Giacomini\u2019s blood.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-4\">\u00b614 Giacomini cites the United States Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision in <em>Missouri v. </em>McNeely,_U.S._, 133 S. Ct. 1552, 185 L. Ed. 2d 696 (2013), which held that the natural dissipation of alcohol from the bloodstream does not constitute a per-se exigent circumstance justifying a warrantless blood draw in a DUI investigation. Giacomini argues that \u201c[i]f dissipation is insufficient for exigent circumstances, it is insufficient for probable cause\u201d and that, here, the warrant was based on \u201c[t]he mere fact of alcohol dissipation.\u201d However, the record clearly demonstrates that the probable cause determination was not based solely on alcohol dissipation in Giacomini\u2019s blood stream. Officer Weston\u2019s mention of potential alcohol dissipation conveyed the time-sensitive nature of the evidence collection process and was no doubt a motivation for seeking a telephonic warrant, but this did not negate the considerable evidence demonstrating probable cause that Giacomini had driven under the influence of alcohol. This case does not involve a warrantless blood draw based upon exigent circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-7\">B. Right of Privacy</p>\n<p id=\"b444-8\">\u00b615 \u201cThe right of individual privacy is essential to the well-being of a free society and shall not be infringed without the showing of a compelling state interest.\u201d Mont. Const, art. II, \u00a7 10. A compelling state interest can be found where the State enforces its criminal laws to protect other fundamental rights of its citizens. Even so, \u201cthe State may not invade an individual\u2019s privacy unless the procedural safeguards attached to the right to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures are met.\u201d <em>State v. Elison, </em>2000 MT 288, \u00b6 53, 302 Mont. 228, 14 P.3d 456.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-9\">\u00b616 Although Giacomini expressly states he is not challenging the constitutionality of the blood draw provisions of the statute, he argues that \u201cforced blood draws for a DUI without exceptional circumstances such as injuries or potential death from an accident violate the Montana Constitution.\u201d This argument appears to challenge the constitutionality of the revisions made by Senate Bill 42 that authorize applications for blood draw search warrants in certain cases not involving injury or death. His argument is premised on this Court\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>caution that \u201cwe will not hesitate to hold that a blood test taken without probable cause or exigent circumstances is unreasonable and an invasion of a person\u2019s right to individual privacy.\u201d <em>Collins, </em>232 Mont. at 83, 755 P.2d at 1379. However, as noted above, Giacomini\u2019s case does not involve a blood test taken without probable cause, so his argument fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-5\">\u00b617 Giacomini also argues that \u201c[a]llowing needles to be stuck in people without their permission simply for being suspected of being under the influence is going too far\u201d and violates the right of privacy. He further contends that allowing law enforcement to draw his blood based on \u201ca 22 year old breath test refusal\u201d is unreasonable and \u201ctoo close to the rack and pinion\u201d to pass constitutional muster. He states that \u201c[t]he central issue is sufficient probable cause to overcome our Right to Privacy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b445-6\">\u00b618  Giacomini\u2019s arguments do not allege that police exceeded the authority granted by the statute to seek a blood-draw warrant or that police exceeded the scope of the warrant in drawing his blood. Rather, Giacomini appears to be making an as-applied challenge to the authority granted by the statute as a violation of his right of privacy. As such, these arguments necessarily implicate a constitutional challenge, which Giacomini has not supported with proper briefing or relevant authority. Neither has he addressed our holding in <em>Collins </em>that \u201c[w]e do not believe that the taking of a blood sample by trained medical personnel is either harmful or offensive given the present state of medical technology and blood testing techniques. Millions of Americans submit to blood sampling every day without ill effect.\u201d 232 Mont. at 80-81, 755 P.2d at 1378. We decline to address these arguments further and they are denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-7\">\u00b619 <em>2.

He maintains that any delay on his part \u201cis understandable\u201d but makes no effort to establish that the video evidence was unavailable earlier or that there was other good cause for the delay that would justify relief from the deadline. Under the plain language of \u00a7 46-13-101, MCA, Giacomini\u2019s \u201cRequest for Hearing\u201d was untimely.
