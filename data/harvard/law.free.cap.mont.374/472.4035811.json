We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-8\">PROCEDURAL AND FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b499-9\">\u00b62 The Legislature established the Montana Board of Oil and Gas Conservation with broad authority to issue permits to drill for oil and gas and to regulate those activities. Section 82-11-111, <em>MCA; Montana Wildlife Federation v. Montana Board of Oil &amp; Gas </em>Conservation, 2012 MT 128, \u00b6 6, 365 Mont. 232, 280 P.3d 877. In December 2011 the Board published notice of its intent to \u201cestablish special statewide temporary spacing units for wells drilled to the Bakken/Three Forks Pool,\u201d including parts of Sheridan, Roosevelt and Richland Counties in Montana. The Board may establish spacing units after notice and hearing, \u00a7 82-11-201, MCA The Ostbys appeared at the meeting at which the Board considered the spacing unit proposal, and objected that they had received insufficient notice and that the Board had not followed proper procedures. The Board proceeded to consider and adopt the spacing unit proposal. On March 2,2012, the Board issued a written order adopting the spacing unit.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-10\">\u00b63 In April 2012 the Ostbys filed in District Court a \u201cPetition for Judicial Review of Order Adopted by the Board of Oil and Gas Conservation.\u201d The Petition stated that it was filed \u201cpursuant to sections 82-11-144 and 2-4-702, MCA.\u201d The Petition alleged that the Board\u2019s adoption of the spacing order was in excess of its statutory authority, and that it was arbitrary and an abuse of discretion. The Petition requested that the District Court hold the Board\u2019s action unlawful, set aside the Board\u2019s order, and grant such other relief as may seem proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-11\">\u00b64 The Board moved to dismiss the Petition and on September 10, 2013, the District Court entered a brief \u201cOrder Granting Motion to Dismiss.\u201d The District Court\u2019s stated rationale for dismissing Ostbys\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>proceeding was that the \u201csole remedy for a person aggrieved by an order of the MBOGC is a challenge under Section 82-11-144, MCA.\u201d Ostbys appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-4\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b500-5\">\u00b65 This Court reviews a decision on a motion to dismiss de novo, to determine whether it is correct. <em>Hartsoe v. Tucker, </em>2013 MT 256, \u00b6 6, 371 Mont. 539, 309 P.3d 39; <em>Grizzly Security v. The Armored Group, </em>2011 MT 128, \u00b6 12, 360 Mont. 517, 255 P.3d 143.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b500-7\">\u00b66 The issue on appeal is whether the District Court properly granted the Board\u2019s motion to dismiss Ostby\u2019s petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-8\">\u00b67  A district court considering a motion to dismiss an action should construe the complaint in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, deeming all factual allegations as true, and dismissal is warranted only if plaintiff is not entitled to relief under any set of facts. <em>Missoula YWCA v. Bard, </em>1999 MT 177, \u00b6 3, 295 Mont. 260, 983 P.2d 933; <em>Hauschulz v. Michael Law Firm, </em>2001 MT 160, \u00b6\u00b6 7-8, 306 Mont. 102, 30 P.3d 357; <em>Meagher v. Butte-Silver Bow County, </em>2007 MT 129, \u00b6 13, 337 Mont. 339, 160 P.3d 552.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-9\">\u00b68 The only rationale the District Court gave for granting the motion to dismiss was that the \u201csole remedy for a person aggrieved by an order of the MBOGC is a challenge under Section 82-11-144, MCA.\u201d That statute provides that a person adversely affected by an order of the Board may obtain court review and may seek relief by a suit for injunction against the Board. In <em>Montana Wildlife Federation </em>the Federation challenged permits issued by the Board on the ground that the Board\u2019s environmental assessments were inadequate under the Montana Environmental Policy Act, \u00a7 75-1-101, et seq., MCA. The Federation contended that since its challenge was based upon MEPA, judicial review was limited to the Board\u2019s administrative record and that it was improper to consider other evidence regarding the Board\u2019s action. This Court held that \u00a7 82-11-144, MCA, is the more specific statute and that it governs review of Board actions. Therefore, the district court was not limited to the Board\u2019s administrative record and could receive additional evidence when conducting a review of the Board\u2019s decisions. <em>Montana Wildlife Federation, </em>\u00b6 29.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-10\">\u00b69 Ostbys seek to distinguish <em>Montana Wildlife Federation </em>on the ground that they invoked the Montana Administrative Procedure Act (\u00a7 2-4-101, et seq., MCA) and not MEPA in their petition for judicial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>review. A judicial review proceeding under MAPA, is generally confined to the agency\u2019s record, \u00a7 2-4-704, MCA. Ostbys contend that they are entitled to limited judicial review under MAPA, citing \u00a7 82-11-141, MCA. That statute provides that <em>\u201c[ujnless otherwise provided, </em>the Montana Administrative Procedure Act applies\u201d to proceedings involving the Board. (Emphasis added.) Ostbys contend that unless MAPA governs judicial review of Board actions, \u00a7 82-11-141, MCA, will be \u201csuperfluous.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b501-3\">\u00b610 Section 82-11-141, MCA, carries the important caveat that MAPA applies to Board proceedings \u201cunless otherwise provided.\u201d It is clear that \u00a7 82-11-144, MCA, provides otherwise as to \u201ccourt review\u201d of actions of the Board. In <em>Montana Wildlife Federation </em>this Court determined that \u00a7 82-11-144, MCA, is a specific statute governing court review of Board actions, and that it should be applied instead of provisions generally applicable to a broad array of State activities. <em>Montana Wildlife Federation, </em>\u00b6 29. In addition, MAPA itself specifically provides that its judicial review provisions do not \u201climit use of or the scope of judicial review available under other means of review, redress, relief or trial de novo provided by statute.\u201d Section 2-4-702(l)(a), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-4\">\u00b611  We conclude that a proceeding seeking judicial review of an order of the Board of Oil and Gas Conservation must proceed as a de novo review in district court and not as a judicial review under MAPA. Sections2-4-702(1) and 82-11-144, MCA; <em>Montana Wildlife Federation, </em>\u00b6 29.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-5\">\u00b612 While \u00a7 82-11-144, MCA, governs the Ostbys\u2019 challenge to the Board\u2019s action, that does not determine whether the District Court properly dismissed their action. We conclude that the District Court erred in dismissing the action. Even though Ostbys argue that they are entitled to MAPA judicial review limited to the administrative record, they also clearly cited and relied upon \u00a7 82-11-144, MCA, as a legal basis for their petition. As noted, their petition was expressly filed \u201cpursuant to\u201d \u00a7 82-11-144, MCA. The Petition alleged, in language closely following that statute, that the Board failed to follow proper procedure and that its adoption of the spacing order was in excess of its statutory authority. The Petition alleged, also closely following the statute, that the Board\u2019s action was unwarranted by facts in the record, and that it was arbitrary and an abuse of discretion. The Petition alleged, again closely following that statute, that the Board\u2019s action interfered with Ostbys\u2019 contractual mineral interests, and requested that the District Court hold unlawful and set aside the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>Board\u2019s Order, and grant such other relief as may seem proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-4\">\u00b613 These allegations, coupled with the Ostbys\u2019 express reliance upon \u00a7 82-11-144, MCA, should have been sufficient to save their Petition from dismissal by the District Court on the ground that they had not pursued their \u201csole remedy\u201d of proceeding under that very statute. The District Court could have allowed the action to proceed under \u00a7 82-11-144, MCA, as pled in the Petition. To the extent that the Ostbys incorrectly relied upon MAPA judicial review, the District Court could have stricken the claim for judicial review under MAPA or it could have allowed Ostbys an opportunity to file an amended Petition. Outright dismissal of the Petition, however, was not warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-5\">\u00b614  The District Court should have allowed the Ostbys to proceed with their claims under \u00a7 82-11-144, MCA. The District Court\u2019s order dismissing the action is reversed and this matter is remanded for further proceedings.</p>\n<judges id=\"b502-6\">JUSTICES McKINNON, WHEAT, COTTER and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
