Scentry is the manufacturer of NoMate, a pest control product designed to protect <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>various agricultural crops from destructive insects by thwarting the insects\u2019 mating activities. Applewood Orchards, a Michigan corporation, purchased NoMate in 2006 from Wilbur-Ellis (W-E), a distributor of NoMate. Applewood used the product on its apple crop in spring and summer 2006 for protection against codling moths. It subsequently discovered significant moth damage and pursued a tort action against Scentry and W-E in a Michigan court. Scentry notified Mid-Continent and both Scentry and W-E requested that the insurer defend them under Scentry\u2019s policy. Mid-Continent initially refused but subsequently agreed to defend Scentry, reserving its right to determine its coverage obligations later. It persisted in its refusal to defend W-E and W-E subsequently settled with Applewood for $62,500.</p>\n<p id=\"A-A\">\u00b62 In the tort action, the Michigan court ruled against Scentry and in favor of Applewood, and entered a $544,325 award. A few months prior to the Michigan court\u2019s resolution, Scentry filed a declaratory judgment action against Mid-Continent in Montana\u2019s Thirteenth Judicial District Court seeking declaratory relief on coverage issues. W-E and Applewood intervened. FoUowingthe Michigan court\u2019s ruling, all parties in the Montana proceeding moved for summary judgment. The District Court granted Scentry, Applewood, and W-E\u2019s motions and denied Mid-Continent\u2019s motion. Based upon stipulated damages, the court awarded Applewood $595,000, Scentry $210,000, and W-E $460,000. Mid-Continent appeals the orders of summary judgment. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-4\">ISSUES</p>\n<p id=\"b46-5\">\u00b63 Mid-Continent presents the following issues on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b46-6\">\u00b64 Did the District Court err in granting Scentry\u2019s motion for summary judgment?</p>\n<p id=\"b46-7\">\u00b65 Did the District Court err in granting W-E\u2019s motion for summary judgment?</p>\n<p id=\"b46-8\">\u00b66 Did the District Court err in granting Applewood\u2019s motion for summary judgment?</p>\n<p id=\"b46-9\">\u00b67 Did the District Court err in denying Mid-Continent\u2019s motion for summary judgment?</p>\n<p id=\"b46-10\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b46-11\">\u00b68 Scentry is a pest control product manufacturer with its principal place of business in Billings, Montana. In 2006, Applewood Orchards purchased Scentry\u2019s product from W-E and applied it to portions of its Michigan apple orchard. It is undisputed that Applewood applied the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>product correctly and in accordance with the application instructions, and that it subsequently monitored the crop appropriately. However, Applewood suffered significant codling moth damage to those portions of its apple crop treated with Scentry\u2019s product.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-4\">\u00b69 During this time, from May 1,2006, through May 1,2007, Scentry carried $2 million in commercial general liability (CGL) insurance with Mid-Continent Casualty Company. Scentry claims it also carried $2 million in products-completed operations hazard coverage (PCOH) with Mid-Continent. Mid-Continent asserts it did not insure Scentxy for PCOH.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b47-5\">\n<em>Michigan litigation</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b47-6\">\u00b610 In 2008, Applewood brought an action in the Circuit Court for Lenawee County, Michigan, against Scentry\u2019s distributor, W-E. In 2009, Applewood filed an amended complaint adding Scentry as a defendant and claiming breach of warranty of merchantability, breach of warranty of fitness, breach of contract, negligence, misrepresentation, fraud in the inducement, and violation of the Michigan Consumer Protection Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-7\">\u00b611 Upon notice of Applewood\u2019s complaint, Scentry notified Mid-Continent and tendered the matter to the insurer for a defense. Mid-Continent refused, asserting that Applewood\u2019s claims did not fall within the CGL coverage of Scentry\u2019s policy. Scentry countered that its claims were covered under the PCOH coverage of the policy but Mid-Continent did not address this claim. After Scentry made additional demands for a defense under the policy, Mid-Continent subsequently assumed Scentry\u2019s defense under a reservation of rights with respect to coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-8\">\u00b612 W-E, asserting it was an additional insured on Scentry\u2019s policy, also sought a defense from Mid-Continent. Mid-Continent repeatedly refused and W-E assumed its own defense. Ultimately, it settled with Applewood for $62,500.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-9\">\u00b613 In April 2011, the Michigan court conducted a 4-day bench trial. At the conclusion, the court held that Scentry was liable to Applewood <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>for breach of the implied warranty of fitness, breach of the implied warranty of merchantability, and fraud in the inducement. The court issued judgment in May 2011 and awarded Applewood damages of $508,564.69 plus costs and pre-judgment interest for a total award of $544,325.03.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-4\">\n<em>Montana litigation</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b48-5\">\u00b614 In January 2011, as the Michigan case was proceeding toward trial, Scentry brought a declaratory action against Mid-Continent in the Thirteenth Judicial District Court of Montana, seeking a judgment declaring that Scentry was covered under its policy with Mid-Continent for Applewood\u2019s claims and that Mid-Continent was obligated to defend and indemnify Scentry.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-6\">\u00b615 In May 2011, W-E was granted leave to intervene in the Montana cause of action. It argued that as an additional insured under the Mid-Continent policy, it was entitled to indemnification for its settlement and expenses. In September 2011, Scentry moved for summary judgment. In December 2011, Applewood moved to intervene in order to assert a right to recover the Michigan judgment against Mid-Continent. Applewood\u2019s motion to intervene was granted by the District Court. Shortly thereafter Mid-Continent moved for summary judgment. In March 2012, Applewood moved for summary judgment and in November 2012, W-E filed a second motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-7\">\u00b616 On December 12,2012, the District Court issued its Decision on Summary Judgment Motions, addressing each party\u2019s motion individually.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-8\">\n<em>Scentry</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b48-9\">\u00b617 The court concluded that in addition to providing the undisputed CGL coverage, Scentry\u2019s polity with Mid-Continent also provided coverage for PCOH. The District Court held that Applewood\u2019s claims for breach of the implied warranties of merchantability and fitness fell within the PCOH coverage and entitled Scentry to summary judgment on its claim against Mid-Continent for coverage and indemnification.</p>\n<p id=\"AWm\">\u00b618 Mid-Continent argued that any award to Scentry must be proportionately reduced in light of the Michigan court\u2019s finding of fraud, as fraud is considered an uninsured intentional act. The court declined to apportion the award, explaining that either Mid-Continent did not seek apportionment in the Michigan case or sought apportionment there but was unsuccessftd. Moreover, Mid-Continent did not \u201cproduce[ ] a colorable argument for apportionment\u201d before the District Court. The court held that \u201cliability and damages which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>Applewood sustained are covered by the [PCOH] portion of the policy, and therefore Mid-Continent must indemnify Scentry for the Applewood judgment.\u201d The court therefore granted Scentry\u2019s motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-4\">\n<em>Applewood</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b49-5\">\u00b619 As to Applewood, the District Court merely noted that Applewood moved for summary judgment based upon Scentry\u2019s arguments; therefore, having granted Scentry\u2019s motion, the court granted Applewood\u2019s as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-6\">\n<em>Wilbur-Ellis</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b49-7\">\u00b620 W-E moved for partial summary judgment seeking a declaration that it was an additional insured under Scentry\u2019s policy and, as such, Mid-Continent should have defended it upon W-E\u2019s requests. The District Court rejected Mid-Continent\u2019s argument that it did not insure W-E, finding that \u201cMid-Continent accepted an additional premium for Wilbur-Ellis, as well as issued a certificate of insurance.\u201d The court concluded that having</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b49-8\">previously held that Mid-Continent must indemnify Scentry ... Mid-Continent must also indemnify Wilbur-Ellis for the defense costs which [W-E] bore as well as the settlement amount. Mid-Continent had a duty to either defend the case, or prove with the evidence available that defense was not available because of exclusions, or defend under a reservation of rights ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b49-9\">Based upon these findings and conclusions, the District Court granted W-E\u2019s motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-10\">\n<em>Mid-Continent</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b49-11\">\u00b621 Mid-Continent also sought summary judgment, asserting that it had neither a \u201cduty to defend nor duty to indemnify\u201d W-E in the underlying Michigan action. Noting that it had granted W-E\u2019s summary judgment motion on the same grounds, the District Court denied Mid-Continent\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-12\">\u00b622 Mid-Continent appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-13\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b49-14\">\u00b623 We review a district court\u2019s ruling on a motion for summary judgment de novo, applying the same criteria of M. R. Civ. P. 56 as did the district court. Summary judgment \u201cshould be rendered if the pleadings, the discovery and disclosure materials on file, and any affidavits show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d M. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(3); <em>Newman v. Scottsdale Ins.

We review a district court\u2019s conclusions of law de novo to determine whether they are correct. <em>Newman, </em>\u00b6 22 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b50-6\">\u00b626 Lastly, we will uphold a correct result regardless of the reasons given by the district court. <em>Stansbury v. Lin, </em>257 Mont. 245, 248, 848 P.2d 509, 511 (1993) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b50-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b50-8\">\u00b627 <em>Did the District Court err in granting Scentry\u2019s motion for summary judgment?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b50-9\">\u00b628 Mid-Continent argues on appeal that because Scentry did not meet its summary judgment burden establishing the existence of PCOH coverage in the District Court, the court erred by concluding that Scentry\u2019s policy provided such coverage. Mid-Continent relies upon the first page of its 2-page policy declaration which indicates that Scentry paid no separate premium for PCOH coverage. <em>(See </em>\u00b6 30 below.) Mid-Continent therefore maintains that Scentry had no coverage for completed products hazards.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-10\">\u00b629 Scentry counters that the second page of the policy declarations pages expressly indicates a $2 million limit of insurance for \u201cproducts-completed operations aggregate,\u201d a/k/a PCOH. It also asserts that Mid-Continent conceded on multiple occasions throughout this proceeding that Scentry had PCOH coverage. The District Court found that Scentry\u2019s policy from Mid-Continent provided $2 million in both CGL and PCOH.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-11\">\u00b630 Scentry\u2019s insurance policy contains several references to PCOH coverage. Initially, page one of the declarations pages of the policy provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b50-12\">This policy consists of the following coverage parts for which a premium is indicated.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b50-14\">Commercial General Liability Coverage Part $12.284</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b50-15\">Owners and Contractors Protective Liability Coverage Part $_</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b50-17\">Products/Completed Operations Liability Coverage Part $_</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b50-19\">Railroad Protective Liability Coverage Part $_</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b50-20\">TOTAL $12.284</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b51-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>Page two of the declarations pages provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b51-4\">LIMITS OF INSURANCE</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A5Q\">General Aggregate Limit (Other than Products-$2.000.000 Completed Operations)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b51-6\">$2.000.000 Products-Completed Operations Aggregate Limit</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aqt\">$1.000.000 Personal and Advertising Injury Limit</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b51-8\">$1.000.000 Each Occurrence Limit</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b51-9\">$ 100.000 Damage to Premises Rented To You (Any One Premises)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b51-10\">EXCLUDED Medical Expense Limit (Any One Person)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b51-15\">\u00b631 Section III of the policy also addresses limits of insurance. Subsections 2 and 3 of Section 111 state:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b51-16\">2. The General Aggregate Limit is the most we will pay for the sum of:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b51-17\">a. Medical Expenses under Coverage C;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b51-18\">b. Damages under Coverage A, except damages because of \u201cbodily injury\u201d or \u201cproperty damage\u201d included in the \u201cproducts-completed operations hazard\u201d; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b51-19\">c. Damages under Coverage B.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b51-20\">3. The Products-Completed Operations Aggregate Limit [PCOH] is the most we will pay under Coverage A for damages because of \u201cbodily injury\u201d and \u201cproperty damage\u201d included in the \u201cproducts-completed operations hazard.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b51-21\">\u00b632 Section V of the policy provides relevant definitions and includes a definition for \u201cproducts-completed operations hazard.\u201d As defined in the policy, PCOH provides protection to the insured for \u201call... \u2018properly damage\u2019 occurring away irom premises [the insured] own[s] or rent[s] and arising out of [the insured\u2019s] product....\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b51-22\">\u00b633 In addition to being bound by the foregoing terms and conditions of the policy, Mid-Continent stated in its Answer to Scentry\u2019s Complaint for Declaratory Judgment \u201cthat a portion of the Mid-Continent policy could provide coverage for products-completed operations coverage.\u201d Also, in a 2011 letter, Mid-Continent\u2019s attorney stated \u201cif the jmy [in the Michigan case] found that Scentay Biologicals\u2019 product did not perform as warranted and caused damage to Applewood Orchards\u2019 crop, the PCOH coverage would apply.\u201d Lastly, in Mid-Continent\u2019s answer to the amended complaint, the insurer stated that the policy \u201cis a commercial general liability... policy that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>included products-completed operations coverage.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b52-4\">\u00b634  We agree with the District Court\u2019s conclusion that the Mid-Continent policy provided PCOH coverage to Scentry. Although page one of the Mid-Continent policy does not reflect the payment of a premium for PCOH coverage, page two of the declarations specifically provides limits of insurance in the sum of $2 million for \u201cProducts-Completed Operations Aggregate Limit.\u201d It is well-established that ambiguities in an insurance policy are construed against the insurer. <em>Newman, </em>\u00b6 41. Moreover, Mid-Continent\u2019s admissions in its correspondence and pleadings significantly buttress the court\u2019s conclusion that this coverage was provided to Scentry.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-5\">\u00b635 Having determined that Scentry\u2019s policy provided PCOH coverage, we next address whether Scentry\u2019s claims obligated Mid-Continent to indemnify it under the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-6\">\u00b636 Mid-Continent argued to the District Court and on appeal that the insurance policy applies to property damage only if the property damage is caused by an \u201coccurrence.\u201d An \u201coccurrence\u201d is defined as \u201can accident, including continuous or repeated exposure to substantially the same general harmful conditions.\u201d Mid-Continent posits that Scentry\u2019s claim does not constitute an \u201coccurrence\u201d because the claim arises from a fraudulent, intentional act, and not an accident. Relying upon the Michigan court\u2019s determination that Scentry was liable for breach of the implied warranties of fitness and merchantability and fraud in the inducement, Mid-Continent maintains that because Scentry fraudulently induced Applewood to purchase its defective product, all of Applewood\u2019s damages stem from this non-accidental conduct and therefore are not protected by the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-7\">\u00b637 Scentry counters with multiple alternative arguments, one of which is that the property damage suffered by Applewood was caused by an occurrence because it (Scentry) did not intend the damage to occur. It argues that the policy definition of \u201coccurrence\u201d turns on whether the underlying conduct is intentional or accidental. Quoting <em>Landa v. Assurance Co., </em>2013 MT 217, \u00b6 20, 371 Mont. 202, 307 P.3d 284, Scentry submits that \u201c[generally, the term \u2018accident\u2019 from the standpoint of the insured reasonably refers to any unexpected happening that occurs without intention or design on the part of the insured.\u201d Scentry recites portions of Applewood\u2019s first amended complaint filed in the Michigan court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b52-8\">Misrepresentation by Defendants [Scentry and W-E]:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b52-9\">39. Defendants represented to [Applewood] that the product sold to [Applewood] was a tested, proven or otherwise effective product <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>that met applicable standards and would protect [Applewood\u2019s] orchards from moth damage.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b53-4\">40. Defendants\u2019 representations were untrue.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b53-5\">41. Defendants knew or should have known, or were negligent in not knowing, that the representations were not true.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b53-6\">\u00b638 Scentry asserts that it was upon these allegations that the Michigan court based its fraudulent inducement ruling and that because the court could have premised its determination on the allegation that Scentry \u201cshould have known, or were negligent in not knowing,\u201d the court\u2019s ruling did not necessarily mean that the ostensible fraud was intentional rather than negligent or accidental. Moreover, as Applewood points out in its brief</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b53-7\">Under Michigan law, the conduct which forms the basis of a fraudulent inducement claim may be intentional, reckless or negligent. In Michigan, negligent fraudulent inducement is referred to as \u201cinnocent misrepresentation.\u201d U.S. Fidelity &amp; Guaranty Co. v. Black. 313 N.W.2d 77, 84 (Mich. 1981).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b53-8\">Given the anomalies of Michigan law, it was incumbent upon Mid-Continent to seek clarification of the Michigan court\u2019s ruling if it intended to rely upon it to avoid coverage. Mid-Continent did not do so.</p>\n<p id=\"Ao\">\u00b639  It also bears repeating that fraud in the inducement was one of three grounds for the Michigan judgment, the others being breach of the implied warranties of fitness and merchantability. As noted, fraud in the inducement may be premised upon an innocent misrepresentation, and as such would not be considered an intentional act. Furthermore, an \u201coccurrence\u201d under the policy includes \u201ccontinuous or repeated exposure to substantially the same general harmful conditions,\u201d which is exactly what occasioned the damage to the Applewood crop. Thus, the threshold requirement of an \u201coccurrence\u201d as defined in the Mid-Century policy has clearly been satisfied. We therefore conclude the District Court did not err in granting Scentry\u2019s motion for summary judgment</p>\n<p id=\"AXn\">\u00b640 <em>Did the District Court err in granting W-E\u2019s motion for summary judgment?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b53-9\">\u00b641 Mid-Continent argues that under the express terms of the relevant endorsement to its policy, it owed no duty to defend or indemnify W-E because Scentry had not executed a \u201cwritten \u2018insured contract\u2019 \u201d to designate W-E as an additional insured. Additionally, it asserts that \u201cpayment of a premium and the issuance of a certificate of liability insurance was not a proper basis for [the District Court] to conclude that Mid-Continent owed [W-E] a duty to defend.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b54-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>\u00b642 The endorsement page of Scentry\u2019s Mid-Continent policy naming W-E as an additional insured states that \u201c[t]his amendment applies only when you have agreed by written \u2018insured contract\u2019 to designate the person or organization listed above as an additional insured subject to all provisions and limitations of this policy.\u201d W-E acknowledges that there is no single document reflecting the agreement between Scentry and W-E that Scentry would provide it with coverage under Scentry\u2019s Mid-Continent policy. It argues, however, that nothing in the policy requires such a single document. As proof of the existence of such agreement, W-E points to the affidavit of Deborah Wagner who worked for a Montana insurance company and who was responsible for procuring insurance for Scentry dining the time at issue. She stated that W-E was an additional insured on Scentry\u2019s policy beginning in 2001 and continuing through at least May 1, 2007. She explained that the procedure for adding an additional insured to Scentry\u2019s policy required that W-E submit a written request to Scentry, Scentry would then notify her of the request, and she, in turn, would send a written request to Mid-Continent. She stated that Scentry paid the premium for adding W-E to its policy and in accordance with procedure Wagner\u2019s company issued a certificate of liability insurance.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-4\">\u00b643 W-E also refers to the affidavit of Mike Whalen, Scentry\u2019s president. Whalen states in his affidavit that W-E sent a letter to Scentry stating that as a condition for selling Scentry\u2019s product, W-E required that Scentry add W-E to its liability policy as an additional insured. Whalen stated he recalled receiving the letter and notifying Deborah Wagner of the request and subsequently completing the necessary steps to add W-E. Lastly, W-E summarized an affidavit submitted by a now-retired W-E District Manager, Herald Peeples. Peeples\u2019 affidavit supported the recollections of both Wagner and Whalen. We therefore conclude there were sufficient writings to satisfy the \u201cwritten \u2018insured contract\u2019 \u201d provision of Scentry\u2019s policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-5\">\u00b644 Turning to Mid-Continent\u2019s refusal to defend and indemnify W-E, it is well-established that the duty to defend is broader than the duty to indemnify. <em>Farmers Union Mut. Ins. Co. v. Staples, </em>2004 MT 108, \u00b6 21, 321 Mont. 99, 90 P.3d 381 (citations omitted). In <em>Staples, </em>we put insurers on notice that \u201c[u]nless there exists an unequivocal demonstration that the claim against an insured does not fall within the insurance policy\u2019s coverage, an insurer has a duty to defend.\u201d <em>Staples, </em>\u00b6 22. Moreover, we repeatedly explained that had Farmers Union believed there was \u201ca legitimate basis for contesting coverage, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>it could have tendered the defense under a reservation of rights and filed a declaratory judgment action.\u201d <em>Staples, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 26,28. It is apparent that Mid-Continent understands the concept of \u201cdefending with a reservation of rights\u201d as that is what it did with respect to Scentry\u2019s claims for coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-4\">\u00b645  The record unequivocally establishes that Mid-Continent charged Scentry a premium of $150 to add W-E as an additional insured to its policy. The District Court also found that Mid-Continent agreed to the issuance of a certificate of insurance naming W-E as an additional insured and identified W-E as an additional insured in the Scentiy policy endorsements schedule. This evidence convinced the District Court that Mid-Continent should have, at the least, defended W-E in the Michigan action. Moreover, we conclude, based upon the affidavit testimony described above, that there existed a written agreement between W-E and Scentry that Scentry would provide liability insurance to W-E as an added insured. For these reasons, we agree with the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-5\">\u00b646  Because Mid-Continent persisted in its refusal to defend W-E, it did not raise any coverage defenses to W-E\u2019s claims for indemnification. As we have determined that Mid-Continent erred in refusing to defend W-E in the underlying case, Mid-Continent is estopped from now denying indemnification for W-E\u2019s damages, including the settlement amount and the amounts it expended for attorney fees. <em>Staples, </em>\u00b6 28 (If insurer unjustifiably refused to defend, it is estopped from denying coverage.); <em>Newman, </em>passim. Though unnecessary to our conclusion, we further note that the rationale that supports the existence of coverage for Scentry applies with equal force to W-E, as it was a co-insured under the Mid-Continent policy with Scentry, and thus received the same coverage as Scentry received. We therefore conclude that the District Court did not err in granting W-E\u2019s motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-6\">\u00b647 <em>Did the District Court err in granting Applewood\u2019s motion for summary judgment?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b55-7\">\u00b648 Mid-Continent argues that Applewood failed to establish it was legally entitled to recover \u2014 directly from Mid-Continent \u2014 the settlement amount agreed upon by W-E in the Michigan litigation. As noted above, W-E settled Applewood\u2019s claim against it prior to the Michigan court trial for $62,500. Applewood counters that it is so entitled under the express terms of the Mid-Continent poli&lt;y. Section IV, subsection (3)(b) of the policy provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b55-8\">A person or organization may sue us to recover on an agreed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>settlement or on a final judgment against an insured; but we will not be liable for damages that are not payable under the terms of this Coverage Part or that are in excess of the applicable limit of insurance.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b56-4\">\u00b649  The District Court granted Applewood\u2019s motion for summary judgment noting that Applewood moved for summary judgment \u201cbased on the briefing of Scentry\u201d and it had granted Scentry\u2019s motion. Applewood likewise adopted by reference Scentry\u2019s arguments in its brief on appeal before this Court. We reject Mid-Continent\u2019s argument that Applewood was obligated to posit additional or different legal arguments; Applewood is, after all, simply seeking recovery of the agreed judgments entered against Mid-Continent\u2019s insureds. In light of our foregoing determinations, and there being no objection by either Scentry or W-E, we conclude the District Court did not err in granting Applewood\u2019s motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-5\">\u00b650 <em>Did the District Court err in denying Mid-Continent\u2019s motion for summary judgment?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b56-6\">\u00b651 Having affirmed the District Court\u2019s rulings granting Scentry, Applewood, and W-E\u2019s motions for summary judgment, we have effectively affirmed the court\u2019s decision denying Mid-Continent\u2019s motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-7\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b56-8\">\u00b652 For the foregoing reasons, we conclude the District Court did not err in granting the summary judgment motions filed by Scentry, W-E, and Applewood. The judgment of the District Court is affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"AiR\">JUSTICES McKINNON, BAKER, WHEAT and RICE concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b47-10\"> \u201cThe distinct risk of loss occasioned by a defect in the insured\u2019s product, which manifests itself only after the insured has relinquished control of the product and at a location away from the insured\u2019s normal business premises, is covered by the purchase of separate \u201cproducts hazard\u2019 coverage.
