The Combined Petition was filed on March 10,2014, and the Attorney General responded within the time allowed by law. The Petition challenges the legal sufficiency of Initiative No. 171 (I-171) and seeks an order enjoining the Secretary of State from approving petitions for circulation to the electorate for signatures or otherwise submitting the measure for approval by the voters. The Petition further seeks a declaration that 1-171 is unconstitutional and void and may not appear on the ballot. For the reasons explained below, the Court denies the Petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-6\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b432-7\">\u00b62 The proposed ballot measure was submitted to the Montana Secretary of State on December 18,2013. It would prohibit the State of Montana and its political subdivisions from using funds, resources or personnel to administer or enforce the federal Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, Public Law No. 111-148 (\u201cAffordable Care Act\u201d). The measure also would prohibit expansion of the Montana Medicaid Program as provided for by the Affordable Care Act and would prohibit the state and its political subdivisions from planning, creating or participating in a health insurance exchange.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-8\">\u00b63 The Secretary of State submitted the proposed ballot measure to the Attorney General pursuant to \u00a7 13-27-202, MCA, for review and preparation of ballot statements in accordance with \u00a7 13-27-312, MCA. The Attorney General obtained a fiscal note from the Governor\u2019s Budget Office and solicited public comment on proposed ballot statements. On Februaiy 27,2014, the Attorney General approved the measure for legal sufficiency and returned it to the Secretary of State with a statement of purpose and a fiscal statement, to be placed on the petitions for circulation and on the ballot if the measure qualifies. In accordance with \u00a7 13-27-312(7), MCA, the Attorney General notified the Secretary of State that the proposed measure conflicts with another measure that is proposed for the ballot at the November 2014 general election. The Secretary of State approved the initiative petition for signature gathering on March 10,2014.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-9\">\u00b64 Petitioners raise four grounds in support of their argument that 1-171 is not legally sufficient. First, they challenge the adequacy of the ballot statements approved by the Attorney General. Second, they assert that the measure addresses a matter concerning an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>appropriation of money and therefore is outside the initiative power prescribed by Article HI, Section 4(1) of the Montana Constitution. Third, they argue that the measure contains more than one subject, in violation of Article V, Section 11(3) of the Montana Constitution. Fourth, they contend that the measure is unconstitutional under the Supremacy Clause of the United States Constitution, U.S. Const. Art. VI, cl. 2, because it proposes a state law that is completely preempted \u201cas an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of\u201d the ACA. <em>English v. Gen. Elec. Co., </em>496 U.S. 72, 79, 110 S. Ct. 2270, 2275(1990). \u00b65 The Attorney General responds that the ballot statements fairly and impartially explain the proposed ballot measure in plain language within the word limits provided by statute and that the Petitioners\u2019 remaining challenges exceed the scope of his legal sufficiency review of a proposed ballot measure. In the alternative, the Attorney General submits that the proposed ballot measure meets minimum constitutional requirements to proceed with signature-gathering and qualification for the ballot.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b433-6\">\u00b66 <em>1. Did the Attorney General correctly determine that 1-171 is legally </em>sufficient?</p>\n<p id=\"b433-7\">\u00b67 The Attorney General is required by \u00a7 13-27-312(1), MCA, to examine a proposed ballot issue for legal sufficiency and determine whether the ballot statements comply with statutory requirements. \u201cLegal sufficiency\u201d means \u201cthat the petition complies with statutory and constitutional requirements governing submission of the proposed issue to the electors.\u201d Section 13-27-312(7), MCA. The Attorney General\u2019s legal sufficiency review \u201cdoes not include consideration of the substantive legality of the issue if approved by the voters.\u201d Section 13-27-312(7), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-8\">\u00b68  We have made clear in several recent opinions that the Attorney General\u2019s legal sufficiency review does not authorize him to withhold a proposed ballot measure from the ballot for an alleged substantive constitutional infirmity. <em>MEA-MFT v. State of Montana, </em>2014 MT 33, \u00b6 11, 374 Mont. 1, 318 P.3d 702; <em>Montanans Opposed to I-166 v. State of Montana, </em>2012 MT 168, \u00b6 6, 365 Mont. 520, 285 P.3d 435; <em>see also Mont. Consumer Fin. Ass\u2019n v. State, </em>2010 MT 185, \u00b6 9, 357 Mont. 237, 238 P.3d 765. Our most recent opinion on the subject determined a ballot measure to be legally deficient because it did not meet the statutory requirements governing submission of a legislative referendum to the electors. <em>MEA-MFT v. State of Montana, </em>2014 MT <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>76, 374 Mont. 296, 323 P.3d 198.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-4\">\u00b69  As an executive officer of the State of Montana, the Attorney General does not have the authority to make a declaration regarding the constitutionality of 1-171. \u201cConstitutional questions are properly decided by a judicial body, not an administrative official, under the constitutional principle of separation of powers.\u201d <em>Mitchell v. Town of </em>W. <em>Yellowstone, </em>235 Mont. 104, 109, 765 P.2d 745, 748 (1988) (quoting <em>Jarussi v. Bd. of Trustees, </em>204 Mont. 131, 135-36, 664 P.2d 316, 318 (1983)). If a law is repugnant to the Constitution, it is the courts that \u201chave the power, and it is their duty, so to declare.\u201d <em>In re Clark\u2019s Estate, </em>105 Mont. 401, 411, 74 P.2d 401, 406 (1937); <em>see also Stuart v. Dept. of Soc. &amp; Rehab. Servs., </em>247 Mont. 433, 438, 807 P.2d 710, 713 (1991) (\u201cWhen ... a bona fide constitutional issue is reused, a plaintiff has a right to resort to the declaratoxy judgment act for a determination of his rights[.]\u201d) (quoting <em>Mitchell, </em>235 Mont. at 109-10, 765 P.2d at 748).</p>\n<p id=\"b434-5\">\u00b610 The statutes governing the process for submission of initiatives and referenda emd legal challenges thereto were substemtieilly amended in 2007. 2007 Mont. Laws ch. 481. Under the laws as amended, this Court may exercise original jurisdiction only to review the proposed ballot statements for initiatives and referenda and to review the Attorney General\u2019s legal sufficiency determination. The statute does not confer original jurisdiction for any other purposes. Section 3-2-202(3)(a), MCA. Prior to the 2007 amendments, the statute provided for this Court\u2019s consideration of a \u201cconstitutional defect in the substance of a proposed ballot issue[.]\u201d Section 3-2-202(3)(a)(ii), MCA (2005). That provision was removed. 2007 Mont. Laws ch. 481, \u00a7 1. The two recent cases in which ballot measures were stricken from the ballot for substantive constitutional infirmity were not original proceedings, but cases that originated in the district courts and were decided by this Court in the ordinary course of appeal. <em>MEA-MFT v. McCulloch, </em>2012 MT 211, 366 Mont. 266, 291 P.3d 1075; <em>Reichert v. State, </em>2012 MT 111, 365 Mont. 92, 278 P.3d 455. Further, the Legislature has expressly preserved \u201cthe right to challenge a constitutional defect in the substance of an issue <em>approved by a vote of the </em>people.\u201d Section 13-27-316(6), MCA (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b434-6\">\u00b611 Petitioners\u2019 legal sufficiency claims are grounded in three distinct constitutional challenges to 1-171. They first argue that 1-171 violates Article V, Section 11(3) of the Montana Constitution because it contains more than one subject. Petitioners claim that at least three distinct subjects are included in the measure: (1) prohibiting the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>enforcement of the ACA, \u201cwhich itself addresses at least 28 different subjects\u201d; (2) prohibiting Medicaid expansion; and (3) prohibiting health care exchanges. Petitioners next claim that 1-171 is unconstitutional under the Supremacy Clause of the United States Constitution, Art. VI, cl. 2, because the proposed ballot measure is completely preempted by the ACA. Finally, Petitioners claim that I-171 \u201cattempt[s] to enact a law by initiative that addresses a matter concerning the appropriation of money\u201d and therefore is unconstitutional under Article HI, section 4(1) of the Montana Constitution. That section provides: \u201cThe people may enact laws by initiative on all matters except appropriations of money and local or special laws.\u201d Petitioners acknowledge that 1-171 does not appropriate money; they argue, however, that it interferes with funds the Legislature already has appropriated for the 2013 biennium and therefore runs afoul of this constitutional provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-4\">\u00b612 We conclude that none of these constitutional claims meets the definition of a legal deficiency within the scope of the Attorney General\u2019s authority on review of a proposed ballot measure. We conclude further that none of the claims presents an appropriate basis on which to invoke this Court\u2019s original jurisdiction under \u00a7 13-27-316(2), MCA. When the Legislature has prescribed the process by which a ballot measure may be challenged in court, we have required compliance with that process. <em>State ex rel. Mont. Citizens for the Preservation of Citizens' Rights v. Waltermire, </em>224 Mont. 273, 278, 729 P.2d 1283, 1286 (1986). We express no opinion on the merits of any of Petitioners\u2019 constitutional claims or whether any such claims would be appropriate for pre-election review. As no other challenge is raised to the Attorney General\u2019s determination of legal sufficiency, we find no basis to disturb that determination in this proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-5\">\u00b613 <em>2. Do the ballot statements for 1-171 satisfy the requirements of law?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b435-6\">\u00b614 Petitioners allege that the statements of purpose and implication fail to identify the measure in a maimer that will allow a Montana voter to exercise his or her political judgment. They claim that the statements are faulty because they do not explain to voters that all twenty-eight substantive provisions of the ACA will be void in the State of Montana if 1-171 is passed. Petitioners posit that it is wholly unreasonable to expect a voter to decipher the numerous federal statutes that would be affected by the measure, and that the statements fail to explain its substantial and far-reaching consequences on existing Montana programs. Petitioners also claim that the Attorney General improperly has utilized the fiscal statement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>to explain some of the provisions of the initiative itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-4\">\u00b615 The Attorney General\u2019s explanatory statement provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A4T\">[Initiative No. 171] prohibits the State of Montana and its political subdivisions from using funds, personnel or other resources to administer or enforce the federal Affordable Care Act. [1-171] prohibits expansion of the Montana Medicaid program as provided under the Affordable Care Act. [1-171] further prohibits the state and its political subdivisions from pieinning, creating or participating in a health insurance exchange.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b436-5\">The fiscal statement provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b436-6\">The State would save approximately $1.92 billion in state revenues and lose $4.75 billion in federal revenues over five years based on an assumption that the federal government would end the state\u2019s Medicaid Plan, Children\u2019s Health Insurance Plan, and several other programs due to noncompliance with the Affordable Care Act.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b436-7\">\u00b616  As we noted in <em>MEA-MFT, </em>2014 MT 33, \u00b6 11, \u201cthe ballot language must \u2018identify the measure on the ballot so that a Montana voter, drawing on both official and unofficial sources of information and education, will [be able to] exercise his or her political judgment.\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>Harper v. Greely, </em>234 Mont. 259, 269, 763 P.2d 650, 657 (1988)). By statute, the Attorney General\u2019s statement of purpose and implication is limited to 135 words and the fiscal statement is limited to 50 words. Section 13-27-312(2)(a), (3), MCA. The Petitioners cite no authority for their argument that the fiscal statement must not contain any explanation of the initiative. They do not challenge the fiscal statement\u2019s explanation of I-171\u2019s effect \u201con the revenue, expenditures, or fiscal liability of the state[.]\u201d Section 13-27-312(3), MCA. The statement of purpose and implication mentions each of the three topics the Petitioners claim will be affected by the proposed initiative. Given the complexity of the ACA and the impacts of its non-enforcement in Montana, the Attorney General\u2019s statement captures its purpose, implication, and fiscal impacts in summary fashion and is sufficient to inform the voters of the implication of a vote for or against the measure. We conclude that the Attorney General\u2019s ballot statements satisfy the requirements of \u00a7 13-27-312, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-8\">\u00b6 17 IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED that the Petitioners\u2019 request that this Court, in the exercise of its original jurisdiction pursuant to \u00a7 13-27-316(2), MCA, declare 1-171 legally deficient and void and enjoin its circulation for signatures is DENIED.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-9\">\u00b618 The Court having determined that additional briefing on the Petition is unnecessary,</p>\n<p id=\"b437-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>\u00b619 IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the Petitioners\u2019 motion for leave to file a reply brief is DENIED.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-4\">\u00b620 The Clerk is directed to provide notice of this Order to all counsel of record and to the Montana Secretary of State.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-5\">DATED this 2nd day of April, 2014.</p>\n<judges id=\"b437-6\">/S/JUSTICE BAKER</judges>\n<judges id=\"AAN\">We concur:</judges>\n<judges id=\"b437-7\">/S/ CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH</judges>\n<judges id=\"b437-8\">/s/ justice McKinnon</judges>\n<judges id=\"Alj\">/S/JUSTICE COTTER</judges>\n<judges id=\"A2a\">/S/JUSTICE RICE</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
