We address the following issues on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b385-4\">\u00b62 <em>1. Whether the District Court\u2019s order is an appealable order.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b385-5\">\u00b63 <em>2. Whether the District Court erred in denying Seamster\u2019s motion for leave to amend and dismissing his complaint.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b385-6\">\u00b64 We reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-7\">PROCEDURAL AND FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b385-8\">\u00b65 This appeal arises from a constructive discharge claim filed by William Seamster on November 13, 2012. The complaint named the Musselshell County Sheriffs Office as the sole defendant. On January 11,2013, the Sheriffs Office filed a motion to dismiss the complaint.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> It argued that \u201cthe Musselshell County Sheriffs Office is not an independent legal entity subject to suit.\u201d Seamster moved for leave to amend the complaint on January 24, 2013 to \u201cadd[] as an additional Defendant... Musselshell County.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On May 6,2013, the District Court issued an order denying Seamster\u2019s motion to amend and granting the Sheriffs Office\u2019s motion to dismiss without prejudice. Seamster\u2019s proposal would have retained the Musselshell County Sheriffs Office as a defendant. Thus, the court concluded that allowing Seamster to amend would not cure the problem with his complaint. Seamster now appeals the court\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-9\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b385-10\">\u00b66 A district court\u2019s ruling on a motion for leave to amend is reviewed for an abuse of discretion. <em>Bitterroot Intl. Sys. v. </em>W. <em>Star Trucks, Inc., </em>2007 MT 48, \u00b6 48, 336 Mont. 145, 153 P.3d 627 (citing <em>Lindey\u2019s Inc. v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number><em>Prof. Consults., </em>244 Mont. 238, 242, 797 P.2d 920, 923 (1990)). We review de novo a court\u2019s order granting a motion to dismiss under M. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6). <em>Tally Bissell Neighbors, Inc. v. Eyrie Shotgun Ranch, </em>2010 MT 63, \u00b6 15, 355 Mont. 387, 228 P.3d 1134.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b386-5\">\u00b67 <em>1. Whether the District Court's order is an appealable order.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b386-6\">\u00b68 The Sheriffs Office requests that we dismiss the appeal because the District Court\u2019s order is a nonappealable order. Seamster argues that the order is appealable as a final judgment because the statute of limitations for his constructive discharge claim expired prior to the court\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-7\">\u00b69 M. R. App. P. 6 provides that a party may appeal from a final order. The rule lists orders appealable in a civil case, \u201cprovided that the order is the court\u2019s final decision on the referenced matter.\u201d M. R. App. P. 6(3). Neither order appealed by Seamster is listed. We have held, however, that an order dismissing a complaint without prejudice maybe appealable under special circumstances. <em>Farmers Union Mut. Ins. Co. v. Bodell, </em>2008 MT 363, \u00b6 18, 346 Mont. 414, 187 P.3d 913. Special circumstances include both the \u201crunning of a statute of limitations\u201d and when \u201cthe practical effect of the order of dismissal terminates the litigation.\u201d <em>Farmers Union, </em>\u00b6 18.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-8\">\u00b610 In determining whether the court\u2019s order is appealable, the dispositive question is whether Seamster would be barred by the statute of limitations from refiling his complaint. When Seamster filed his motion to amend the complaint to add Musselshell County, his amendment properly would have related back to the date he filed the initial complaint. \u201cThe expiration of the applicable statute of limitations does not bar an amended pleading when the amendment fits the requirements of M. R. Civ. P. 15(c).\u201d <em>H &amp; H Dev., LLC v. Ramlow, </em>2012 MT 51, \u00b6 17, 364 Mont. 283, 272 P.3d 657. Montana Rule of Civil Procedure 15(c) contemplates a situation in which a plaintiff mistakenly names the wrong defendant in its lawsuit and the statute of limitations expires before the proper party is substituted. It provides in part, \u201cAn amendment to a pleading relates back to the date of the original pleading when... the amendment changes the party or the naming of the party against whom a claim is asserted.\u201d M. R. Civ. P. 15(c)(1)(C). In this case, as Musselshell County had notice of the amended complaint within the time for service of the initial complaint, the amendment would have related back to the date of original filing. M. R. Civ. P. 15(c)(l)(C)(i) and (ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b387-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>\u00b611 Because the District Court denied leave to amend and dismissed Seamster\u2019s complaint, however, there is no pleading before the court that now could be amended to supply a relation-back date for filing. Seamster would have to file a new complaint under a new cause number. Ride 15(c) only provides for an amendment \u2014 not a new pleading \u2014 to relate back to the date of the original pleading. M. R. Civ. P. 15(c); <em>See also </em>Charles Alan Wright, Arthur R. Miller &amp; Mary Kay Kane, <em>Federal Practice and Procedure, </em>vol. 6A, \u00a7 1496 n.2 (3d ed., West 2010) (Relation back doctrine \u201chas application only in instances in which the original pleading is amended ... the amendment does not relate back to any prior proceeding.\u201d). Thus, this remedy is unavailable to him.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b387-4\">\u00b612 The Sheriffs Office claims that Seamster \u201carguably\u201d could assert equitable tolling in order to refile his claim. Equitable tolling extends the statute of limitations in situations when a party \u201creasonably and in good faith pursues one of several possible legal remedies....\u201d <em>Schoof v. Nesbit, </em>2014 MT 6, \u00b6 33, 373 Mont. 226, 316 P.3d 831 (internal citations omitted). Equitable tolling also may be applied in \u201crare and exceptional circumstances,\u201d such as when a \u201cdefendant is responsible for concealing the existence of [a] plaintiffs cause of action.\u201d <em>Schoof, </em>\u00b6 35 (internal citations omitted). We conclude that this remedy would not assist Seamster. A complaint against the Sheriff s Office, an entity immune from suit, would not constitute \u201cone of several possible legal remedies.\u201d Nor was Seamster prevented by Musselshell County or its Sheriffs Office from learning the identity of the proper party defendant. No other \u201crare and exceptional\u201d circumstances appear to apply. Because the statute of limitations prevents Seamster from refiling his complaint, the practical effect of the court\u2019s order acts as a final judgment. Accordingly, we conclude that the court\u2019s order is appealable.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-5\">\u00b613 <em>2. Whether the District Court erred in denying Seamster\u2019s motion for leave to amend and dismissing his </em>complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-6\">\u00b614 Seamster sought leave to amend his complaint in accordance with M. R. Civ. P. 15. Rule 15(aX2) provides that \u201c[t]he court should freely <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>give leave when justice so requires.\u201d Although district courts have discretion in granting leave to amend, we have held that Rule 15(a) \u201cfavors allowing amendments.\u201d <em>Bitterroot, </em>\u00b6 50. We have articulated circumstances justifying a court\u2019s denial of a motion to amend. Such situations include when the denial is \u201cfor an apparent reason such as undue delay, bad faith or dilatory motive on the part of the movant, repeated failure to cure deficiencies by amendments previously allowed, undue prejudice to the opposing party by allowance of the amendment, futility of the amendment, etc.\u201d <em>Bitterroot, </em>\u00b6 50 (internal citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b388-4\">\u00b615  We agree with the District Court that it is important to have the correct parties before the court and that Seamster should have dismissed the Sheriffs Office as a named defendant in his proposed amended complaint. The District Court\u2019s time would not have been taken with the procedural minutiae, and this appeal could have been avoided. Nevertheless, under the circumstances, the court\u2019s refusal to allow Seamster to substitute the correct party constituted an abuse of discretion. The court stated that the amendment would be \u201cfutile\u201d because it would not remove a party immune from suit. This ignores the effect of the amendment, which would have added the proper party. Such an amendment certainly is not meaningless. Because misjoinder of parties is not a ground for dismissing an action, the proper remedy would have been to dismiss the Sheriffs Office as a party and allow the amended complaint to proceed. M. R. Civ. P. 21 (\u201cOn motion or on its own, the court may at any time... add or drop a party.\u201d); <em>see also White v. Lobdell, </em>196 Mont. 156, 162, 638 P.2d 1057, 1060 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b388-5\">\u00b616 The facts under which we have upheld a court\u2019s denial of a party\u2019s motion to amend are not present in this case. The Sheriffs Office does not allege, nor does any evidence suggest, that Semester\u2019s request was made in bad faith. It is also clear that allowing the amendment would not prejudice the opposing party, who, as the political subdivision overseeing the Sheriffs Office and having been named in the amended complaint, was on notice that it was being sued.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-6\">\u00b617  Refusing to allow Seamster to amend his complaint, however, resulted in substantial prejudice. Due to the running of the statute of limitations, the court\u2019s denial prevented him from refiling his constructive discharge claim. Such a result is contrary to the purpose of Rule 15 \u2014 \u201cto provide maximum opportunity for each claim to be decided on its merits rather than on procedural technicalities.\u201d Wright, Miller &amp; Kane, <em>Federal Practice and Procedure, </em>\u00a7 1471; <em>see also H &amp; </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number><em>H </em>Dev., \u00b6 17 (Rule 15(c) \u201callows a court to render a dispositive decision on the merits of a party\u2019s argument, rather than on technicalities.\u201d). Under these circumstances, we conclude that justice required the court to allow Seamster leave to amend his complaint to name the proper party. Accordingly, we reverse its order dismissing Seamster\u2019s complaint and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<judges id=\"b389-4\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES COTTER, WHEAT and RICE concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b385-11\"> In Seamster\u2019s notice of appeal, he included Musselshell County as a DefendantAppellee. Because the District Court did not grant Seamster\u2019s motion to amend the complaint, Musselshell County is not a named defendant in this action. We have recaptioned the case to reflect this.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b385-12\"> Section 2-9-102, MCA, authorizes suits against \u201cgovernmental entities,\u201d which includes political subdivisions. Section 2-9-101(5), MCA, defines political subdivisions as \u201cany county, city, municipal corporation, school district, special improvement or taxing district, or other political subdivision or public corporation.\u201d At the trial court, Seamster argued that the Sheriffs Office may meet the applicable definition. On appeal, however, he appears to concede that the Sheriffs Office is not a proper defendant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b387-7\"> Neither party raises the \u201csavings statute,\" \u00a7 27-2-407, MCA, which allows for a one-year extension of the statute of limitations when a timely-filed complaint is dismissed. We therefore do not discuss its applicability here, but observe that we have disallowed the savings statute from renewing a complaint against a party not named in the original complaint. <em>Williams v.
