The School District cross-appeals the District Court\u2019s determination that it wrongfully discharged Cromwell. We affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-4\">\u00b62 We review the following issues on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b26-5\">\u00b63 Whether the District Court properly determined that the School District wrongfully discharged Cromwell.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-6\">\u00b64 Whether the District Court properly awarded Cromwell no damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-7\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b26-8\">\u00b65 The School District hired Cromwell as an administrative assistant in September of 1998. The School District categorized Cromwell as a \u201cclassified employee\u201d upon hiring and provided Cromwell with a classified employee handbook. The classified employee handbook stated that all \u201cemployees must satisfactorily complete a probationary period of six months after which the employee will attain permanent status.\u201d Cromwell\u2019s probationary period of employment ended in March of 1999.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-9\">\u00b66 The School District promoted Cromwell to the position of business manager effective July 1, 1999, but she remained a classified employee. Cromwell and the School District signed a document entitled \u201cBusiness Manager 1999-2000\u201d on September 16, 1999. The document stated that \u201cthe District has and does hereby employ the Business Manager on a full-time year-round basis, commencing on July 1, 1999.\u201d The document explained certain terms of Cromwell\u2019s employment such as salary, fringe benefits, and sick leave. The document did not explicitly state an end date for her term of employment. Cromwell signed similar documents each of the next three years.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-10\">\u00b67 The School District adopted a new classified employee policy on October 9, 2001. The new policy stated that each \u201cclassified employee hired on or after October 9, 2001 shall be employed under annual contracts of a specified term within the meaning of [S]ection 39-2-912, MCA.\u201d Section 39-2-912(2), MCA, exempts an employment agreement covered by a written contract for a specified term from the requirements of the Wrongful Discharge From Employment Act (WDEA), \u00a7\u00a7 39-2-901 to 915, MCA. An employee covered by the WDEA <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"3\">*3</page-number>may not be discharged after completing a probationary period except for good cause. <em>See </em>\u00a7 39-2-904(1)(b), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-4\">\u00b68 The School District notified Cromwell on June 12, 2003, that the school board voted not to renew her contract and terminated Cromwell from employment. The School District granted Cromwell a severance package that matched her salary through August 31, 2003. Cromwell earned an annual salary of $33,280 at the time of her termination.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-5\">\u00b69 Cromwell filed an action for wrongful termination on March 4, 2004. The District Court held a bench trial on April 4,2005. Cromwell provided the only testimony at trial. Cromwell testified that she worked for the School District as a permanent employee according to the terms of the classified employee handbook. Cromwell testified that she did not believe the business manager documents represented annual contracts for specified terms, but merely represented agreements concerning her salary.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-6\">\u00b610 The fifty-two year old Cromwell testified that she had difficulty finding new employment after being discharged by the School District. Cromwell attempted to find work by signing up with Montana Job Services, took various tests that evaluated her computer and typing proficiency, and sent out numerous resumes to positions advertised in local papers. She testified that these postings were for bookkeepers in the private sector and as land title examiners in Ravalli Comity. Cromwell did not keep records of her job search. The School District\u2019s counsel pressed Cromwell on cross-examination why she had not applied for a number of positions that had been recently posted in the paper, such as a position as a financial analyst, and questioned why she failed to visit certain websites while searching for employment. Cromwell responded that she had not been monitoring the paper since finding her new employment, that she did not possess the qualifications required for a financial analyst, and that she relied on newspapers and the job service to find local job postings rather than the internet. As a result, she claims that a limited number of jobs were available in her area.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-7\">\u00b611 Cromwell initially focused her job search in Ravalli County, but eventually widened her search to include Missoula, approximately 35 miles from her home in Victor. Cromwell eventually found a job in Missoula three weeks before her trial started with a construction company where her son also works. She earns $10 an hour and she works approximately 27 hours per week.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-8\">\u00b612 The School District conceded at trial that it did not terminate Cromwell\u2019s employment for cause. The School District contended <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>instead that Cromwell\u2019s employment agreement did not fall within the scope of the WDEA. It asserted that the business manager documents signed by Cromwell and the School District constituted written agreements for specified terms under \u00a7 39-2-912(2), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-4\">\u00b613 The District Court concluded that the School District had wrongfully discharged Cromwell as set forth in \u00a7 39-2-904(l)(b), MCA. The business manager documents that Cromwell signed after attaining permanent employee status did not represent written employment contracts for a specific term under \u00a7 39-2-912(2), MCA. The court found that according to the terms of the employment handbook Cromwell had become a permanent employee after successfully completing the six month probationary period. The School District could not discharge Cromwell without cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-5\">\u00b614 The District Court awarded Cromwell no damages, however, because it concluded that Cromwell did not exercise reasonable diligence in seeking new employment after being terminated by School District. The District Court reasoned that Cromwell neglected the Missoula job market, failed to keep records of her job search, and failed to use certain internet job search resources. The District Court also held that Cromwell failed to present sufficient evidence that reasonable employment opportunities were not available in the Hamilton-Missoula job market. It further determined that the School District had provided a relatively generous severance package that matched her salary for a period of 11 weeks, within which time Cromwell should have been able to find suitable work. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b28-7\">\u00b615 Whether the District Court improperly determined that the School District wrongfully discharged Cromwell.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-8\">\u00b616 The construction and interpretation of a contract constitutes a question of law for the court to decide. <em>Chase v. Bearpaw Ranch Ass\u2019n, </em>2006 MT 67, \u00b6 14, 331 Mont. 421, \u00b6 14, 133 P.3d 190, \u00b6 14. We review a district court\u2019s conclusions of law to determine whether the court\u2019s interpretation of the law is correct. <em>Chase, </em>\u00b6 14. We review any findings of fact made by a district court to support its legal conclusions to determine if they are clearly erroneous. <em>See Watson v. Dundas, </em>2006 MT 104, \u00b6 17, 332 Mont. 164, \u00b6 17, 136 P.3d 973, \u00b6 17.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-9\">\u00b617 The School District asserts that it could terminate Cromwell\u2019s employment without cause because Cromwell\u2019s employment agreement fell within the exemption to the WDEA provided by \u00a7 39-2-912(2), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>MCA. The School District maintains that the business manager documents signed by Cromwell constituted written contracts of employment for a specific term under \u00a7 39-2-912(2), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-4\">\u00b618 Cromwell responds that she worked for the School District as a permanent employee according to the terms of the classified employee handbook. Cromwell contends that the business manager documents represented mere agreements concerning her yearly salary. She points out that the business manager documents do not explicitly state an ending date for her term of employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-5\">\u00b619 We agree with Cromwell that \u00a7 39-2-912(2), MCA, does not apply. The School District\u2019s position contradicts the plain language of its own classified employee handbook. The classified employee handbook that the School District provided to Cromwell upon hiring states that after a six month probationary period \u201cthe employee will attain permanent status.\u201d According to the terms of the School District\u2019s own handbook, Cromwell had attained status as a permanent employee long before she signed the first business manager document on September 16, 1999. The new classified employment handbook does not explicitly address the status of employees such as Cromwell. The handbook does implicitly support the position that Cromwell worked as a permanent employee, however, as it states that only employees \u201chired on or after October 9, 2001 shall be employed under annual contracts of a specified term.\u201d The School District hired Cromwell in September of 1998.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-6\">\u00b620  The business manager documents remain ambiguous concerning the term of employment for Cromwell. We interpret a contract against the party who caused the uncertainty to exist. Watson, \u00b6 27. The School District drafted the documents that do not explicitly state a specified term of employment. Cromwell testified that she understood the business manager documents as mere agreements concerning her yearly salary. Cromwell already had attained status as a permanent employee and the accompanying protections of the WDEA. <em>See </em>\u00a7 39-2-904, MCA. We will not interpret the ambiguous provisions of the business manager documents to modify Cromwell\u2019s employment agreement and deprive her of the protections of the WDEA. We conclude that the business manager documents do not represent written contracts for a specified term under \u00a7 39-2-912(2), MCA. As a result, the District Court correctly determined that the School District wrongfully discharged Cromwell.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-7\">\u00b621 Whether the District Court improperly awarded Cromwell no damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>\u00b622 A court may award damages to a 'wrongfully discharged employee based on lost wages for a period not to exceed four years less any amount that the employee could have earned with reasonable diligence. Section 39-2-905(1), MCA. A district court possesses the discretion to determine the amount of damages recoverable under \u00a7 39-2-905, MCA. <em>Weber v. State </em>(1992), 253 Mont. 148, 153, 831 P.2d 1359, 1362. We review a district court\u2019s discretionary rulings for an abuse of discretion. <em>Jarvenpaa v. Glacier Elec. Co-op. Inc., </em>1998 MT 306, \u00b6 12, 292 Mont. 118, \u00b6 12, 970 P.2d 84, \u00b6 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-4\">\u00b623 The District Court made no finding of fact regarding Cromwell\u2019s diligence in finding new employment. The District Court instead based its award of no damages on its legal conclusion that Cromwell had \u201cfailed to present sufficient evidence that reasonable employment opportunities were not available to her in the Hamilton-Missoula job markets.\u201d We review legal conclusions for correctness. <em>In re Conservatorship of Kloss, </em>2005 MT 39, \u00b6 7, 326 Mont. 117, \u00b6 7, 109 P.3d 205, \u00b6 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-5\">\u00b624 Cromwell argues that the court improperly concluded that she failed to produce sufficient evidence that reasonable employment opportunities were not available in Ravalli County when she presented the only evidence regarding the availability of other jobs through her testimony at trial. Cromwell testified that she sought employment through the job service in Ravalli County, she signed up with a temporary employment agency, and she applied to numerous openings listed in the local paper. Cromwell\u2019s testimony represents the only evidence concerning the availability of job opportunities during her period of unemployment.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-6\">\u00b625 Once the District Court determined that Cromwell had been wrongfully discharged, the burden shifted to the School District to plead Cromwell\u2019s lack of reasonable diligence in finding new employment as an affirmative defense. <em>Martinell v. Montana Power Co. </em>(1994), 268 Mont. 292, 322-23, 886 P.2d 421, 440. As an affirmative defense, the School District, rather than Cromwell, had the burden of proving Cromwell\u2019s failure to mitigate. <em>Martinell, </em>268 Mont. at 322-23, 886 P.2d at 440; <em>E.C.A. Environ. Management v. Toenyes </em>(1984), 208 Mont. 336, 350, 679 P.2d 213, 220. In this case, however, the District Court appears to have reversed the burden as evidenced by its conclusion of law that Cromwell \u201cfailed to present sufficient evidence that reasonable employment opportunities were not available to her in the Hamilton-Missoula job markets.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b30-7\">\u00b626 The School District presented no witnesses to support its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>contention that Cromwell had failed to exercise reasonable diligence in failing to find replacement employment. The School District elected instead to attempt to impeach Cromwell on cross-examination through limited evidence of job opportunities listed in local newspapers that existed at the time of trial. These listings represented jobs available at the time of trial when Cromwell already had found a new job and had stopped looking for employment. The School District presented no evidence that these comparable jobs were available during the period when Cromwell actually was looking for work.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-4\">\u00b627 Cromwell further contends that the District Court improperly relied on the fact that she focused her job search primarily in Ravalli County and did not seek employment more diligently in Missoula, approximately 35 miles from her home in Victor. Cromwell\u2019s initial failure to explore the Missoula job market should not have foreclosed completely an award of damages. Even if Cromwell immediately had found comparable employment in Missoula, she still would be required to drive 70 miles round trip as a result of being wrongfully discharged from her job with the School District in Ravalli County. The law does not require a wrongfully terminated employee to move to another locality to find employment. <em>Martinell, </em>268 Mont. at 321, 886 P.2d at 439. The costs and time associated with a daily commute to a different locality could support an award of damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-5\">\u00b628 Cromwell did concede on cross-examination that she had failed to take advantage of certain internet resources in her job search. It is unclear once again, however, whether these internet resources contained job opportunities that were listed at the time that Cromwell should have been looking for a job. It further is unclear whether Cromwell failed to pursue any of the job prospects contained in those internet resources that may have been available at the time that Cromwell should have been looking for a job. Although Cromwell admittedly neglected to use these internet resources, this omission would serve to reduce any award of damages. This omission should not serve to preclude entirely an award of damages in fight of the uncertainty regarding what job opportunities might have been available through these internet resources and at what time.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-6\">\u00b629  Cromwell now works an average of 27 hours a week in Missoula for $10 an hour, a significant reduction from her full-time job with the School District that paid her an annual salary of $33, 280. The fact that Cromwell now works fewer hours for lower pay and must travel 35 miles from home in order to work would support an award of damages in the absence of evidence that she failed to exercise <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>reasonable diligence in seeking new employment. The District Court made no finding that Cromwell failed to exercise reasonable diligence. We agree with Cromwell that the District Court erred by concluding as a matter of law that she failed to exercise reasonable diligence based on the evidence at trial. The District Court correspondingly abused its discretion in awarding no damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-4\">\u00b630 We affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand this matter to the District Court for the limited purpose of having the court make findings of fact and enter conclusions of law regarding the appropriate amount of damages based on the record presented at the previous trial.</p>\n<judges id=\"b32-5\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES COTTER, NELSON, LEAPHART, WARNER and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
