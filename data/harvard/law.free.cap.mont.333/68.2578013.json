We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-8\">\u00b62 The sole issue raised by Delao on appeal is whether the District Court erred in denying his motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-9\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b93-10\">\u00b63 On October 30, 2004, Montana Highway Patrol Officer Scott Largent (Largent) conducted an investigative stop of Delao in response to a citizen complaint of a drunk driver. Neither side disputes the propriety of the stop.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-11\">\u00b64 Largent approached Delao\u2019s driver\u2019s side window. Delao rolled down his window and Largent introduced himself. Largent questioned Delao and asked for his license and registration. Delao could produce neither.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-12\">\u00b65 Largent returned to his vehicle to call in Delao\u2019s license plate number and to check for any outstanding warrants. While doing so, Delao emerged from his vehicle. Largent quickly exited his vehicle and told Delao to get back inside his car. Delao did not respond coherently and failed to comply with Largent\u2019s request. Concerned for his own safety, Largent took Delao into custody and placed him in the backseat of his cruiser.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-13\">\u00b66 Delao\u2019s vehicle remained unsecured with the doors unlocked and the windows rolled down. The Montana Highway Patrol has a policy to secure the vehicles of individuals taken into custody.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> This policy helps to ensure the protection of the individual\u2019s property and helps to shield the Highway Patrol and its officers from liability. Largent told Delao of his intention to secure Delao\u2019s vehicle. In order to operate the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>vehicle\u2019s power locks and windows, Largent needed the keys from Delao\u2019s ignition. He proceeded to Delao\u2019s vehicle to obtain the keys so as to secure Delao\u2019s vehicle in accordance with the Montana Highway Patrol\u2019s policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-4\">\u00b67 When Largent went to secure Delao\u2019s vehicle, he opened the door and leaned inside to locate the keys in the ignition. Largent did not find them there. As he pulled out of the vehicle, he noticed a clear glass bottle partially covered beneath the center armrest, and he immediately perceived the bottle as a bottle of liquor. Largent then seized the bottle which turned out to be a 375 milliliter bottle of vodka. Largent did not see the bottle of vodka from the outside of the vehicle when he first questioned Delao.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-5\">\u00b68 After seizing the bottle of vodka, Largent returned to his vehicle and asked Delao if the bottle belonged to him. Delao replied that it did not. Largent then asked Delao if he had the keys to his vehicle. At this point, we must clarify a factual discrepancy in the arguments presented to this Court. The State, Delao, and the District Court all misstated that Largent first asked Delao for his keys before he went to secure Delao\u2019s vehicle for the first time. The videotape from Largent\u2019s patrol car reveals that Largent did not ask Delao for his keys before he went to secure Delao\u2019s vehicle for the first time. However, we conclude this factual discrepancy is immaterial to our decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-6\">\u00b69 In any event, after apparently searching his shirt and pants pockets for his keys, Delao replied that he did not have his keys. Largent then returned to Delao\u2019s vehicle one more time, scanned the vehicle, but ultimately could not secure it.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-7\">\u00b610 The State charged Delao with Driving Under the Influence of Alcohol, a felony; Operating a Motor Vehicle Without Proof of Liability Insurance, a misdemeanor; and Driving While License Suspended or Revoked, a misdemeanor. Delao pled guilty to driving without insurance and driving without a license and not guilty to driving under the influence.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-8\">\u00b611 Delao filed a pretrial motion to suppress the bottle of vodka as evidence obtained by means of an illegal search and seizure. The District Court held a hearing on Delao\u2019s motion to suppress and subsequently denied the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-9\">\u00b612 The jury found Delao guilty of Driving Under the Influence of Alcohol. Delao appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-10\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b94-11\">\u00b613 We review a district court's denial of a motion to suppress to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>determine whether its findings of fact are clearly erroneous and whether its application and interpretation of the law is correct. <em>State v. Shaw, </em>2005 MT 141, \u00b6 5, 327 Mont. 281, \u00b6 5, 114 P.3d 198, \u00b6 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b95-5\">\u00b614 The District Court concluded that Largent properly seized the bottle of vodka under the \u201cplain view\u201d doctrine. Delao argues that Largent obtained the bottle of vodka by an illegal search of his vehicle not excepted by the plain view doctrine, and that the District Court erred in not granting his motion to suppress the use of the vodka bottle as evidence at trial. We disagree with Delao\u2019s contention and agree with the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-6\">\u00b615 The Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution and Article II, Section 11 of the Montana Constitution protect individuals against unreasonable searches and seizures. <em>Shaw, </em>\u00b6 7; <em>State v. Elison, </em>2000 MT 288, \u00b6 39, 302 Mont. 228, \u00b6 39, 14 P.3d 456, \u00b6 39. Warrantless searches and seizures are <em>per se </em>unreasonable absent a few carefully drawn exceptions. <em>Shaw, </em>\u00b6 7; <em>Elison, </em>\u00b6 39. One such exception is the plain view doctrine. If, while a police officer is lawfully present on an individual\u2019s property, and in the course of his or her lawful presence, the officer discovers evidence in plain view, and if its incriminating nature is \u201cimmediately apparent,\u201d that evidence may be seized and used against the defendant. <em>State v. DeWitt, </em>2004 MT 317, \u00b6 25, 324 Mont. 39, \u00b6 25, 101 P.3d 277, \u00b6 25. <em>See also State v. Loh </em>(1996), 275 Mont. 460, 473, 914 P.2d 592, 600; <em>State v. Weaselboy, </em>1999 MT 274, \u00b6 23, 296 Mont. 503, \u00b6 23, 989 P.2d 836, \u00b6 23; <em>State v. Bassett, </em>1999 MT 109, \u00b6 52, 294 Mont. 327, \u00b6 52, 982 P.2d 410, \u00b6 52.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-7\">\u00b616 Relying on our opinion in <em>State v. Sawyer </em>(1977), 174 Mont. 512, 518, 571 P.2d 1131, 1134, <em>overruled on other grounds by State v. Long </em>(1985), 216 Mont. 65, 67, 700 P.2d 153, 155, the District Court, in its order denying Delao\u2019s motion to suppress, concluded that Largent had an obligation to secure Delao\u2019s property and that this obligation gave Largent a lawful reason to lean inside Delao\u2019s vehicle to look for Delao\u2019s keys in the ignition. Thus, the District Court concluded, Largent was lawfully present inside the vehicle when he discovered the bottle of vodka in plain view.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-8\">\u00b617 Delao maintains otherwise, arguing that the District Court misapplied the plain view doctrine in his case by overstating Largent\u2019s obligation to him and by thus failing to show that Largent was legally present in his vehicle at the time Largent discovered the bottle of vodka. According to Delao, because Largent was not lawfully present <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>in his vehicle, Largent\u2019s discovery of the bottle of vodka was unlawful and the bottle should have been suppressed as evidence against him.</p>\n<p id=\"AqB\">\u00b618 In <em>Sawyer, </em>we concluded that the police could protect themselves from liability for lost or stolen property by taking an inventory of the items in plain view, locking the vehicle, and returning the keys to the owner. <em>Sawyer, </em>174 Mont. at 517, 571 P.2d at 1134; <em>State v. Hamilton, </em>2003 MT 71, \u00b6 35, 314 Mont. 507, \u00b6 35, 67 P.3d 871, \u00b6 35. In doing so, we recognized two justifications for an inventory search of an impounded vehicle: (1) protection of the contents of the vehicle for the owner's benefit; and (2) protection of the police from claims for lost property in their custody. <em>Sawyer, </em>174 Mont. at 517, 571 P.2d at 1134. Additionally, we held that, as a gratuitous bailee, the police are charged with a slight duty of care which is violated only by gross negligence. <em>Sawyer, </em>174 Mont. at 517, 571 P.2d at 1134.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-4\">\u00b619 <em>Sawyer </em>involved different factual circumstances than the instant case. In <em>Sawyer, </em>the officers impounded the defendant\u2019s vehicle and performed an inventory search. Here, Largent left Delao\u2019s vehicle on the side of the road temporarily and did not perform an inventory search. Nevertheless, we agree with the District Court that, although <em>Sawyer </em>presented different factual circumstances, Largent still had an obligation to secure Delao\u2019s vehicle. The concerns in <em>Sawyer </em>apply not only in the case where the police have impounded a vehicle, but also apply in the situation where, as here, the police have arrested an individual and have temporarily left his vehicle on the side of the road.</p>\n<p id=\"ARt\">\u00b620  Accordingly, we conclude that Largent\u2019s attempt to roll up Delao\u2019s windows and lock his doors fell within the ambit of the slight duty of care that Largent owed to Delao. In attempting to roll up Delao\u2019s windows and lock his doors, Largent made a reasonable effort to perform the duty of care set forth in <em>Sawyer.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b96-5\">\u00b621 Delao argues that Largent performed an illegal inventory search on his vehicle. Again, we disagree. Unlike <em>Sawyer </em>and contrary to Delao\u2019s contention, Largent did not perform an inventory search, or, indeed, any type of \u201csearch\u201d in the constitutional sense. The plain view doctrine simply recognizes that if an article is in plain view, neither its observation nor its seizure involves any invasion of privacy; rather, a seizure of the article involves an invasion only of the owner\u2019s possessory interest. <em>State v. Collard </em>(1997), 286 Mont. 185, 195, 951 P.2d 56, 62-63; <em>Loh, </em>275 Mont. at 468, 914 P.2d at 597 (citing <em>Horton v. California </em>(1990), 496 U.S. 128, 133-34, 110 S.Ct. 2301, 2306, 110 L.Ed.2d 112). Thus, the seizure of an object in plain view does not constitute a search. <em>State v. Carlson </em>(1982), 198 Mont. 113, 118-19, 644 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>P.2d 498, 501. <em>See also State v. Roper, </em>2001 MT 96, \u00b6 17, 305 Mont. 212, \u00b6 17, 26 P.3d 741, \u00b6 17 (holding that officers had a right to seize a black pouch once they were legally present in Roper\u2019s workplace after receiving information that Roper kept drugs in a black pouch); <em>State v. Romero </em>(1986), 224 Mont. 431, 437, 730 P.2d 1157, 1161 (holding that seizure of marijuana constituted a reasonably delayed plain view seizure rather than a search incident to arrest).</p>\n<p id=\"b97-4\">\u00b622 Here, Largent alerted Delao of his intention to go and secure the vehicle. Largent then proceeded to the vehicle and opened the door to look for the keys in the ignition. At this point, Largent concerned himself solely with locating the keys and not with taking an inventory of the vehicle\u2019s contents. During his attempt to locate the keys, Largent testified that the bottle of vodka was in plain view underneath the center armrest, and that he then seized the bottle.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"ACl\">\u00b623 Delao analogizes his case to <em>Elison </em>where we held the defendant had an expectation of privacy in items stored behind the front seat of his vehicle. However, <em>Elison </em>presented facts distinguishable from the present case. In that case, an officer pulled Elison over after a citizen riding along with the officer noticed Elison smoking out of a pipe which the citizen suspected to be a marijuana pipe. The officer asked Elison to exit the vehicle and asked him whether he had marijuana in the vehicle. Elison replied that he had marijuana tucked behind the front seat. The officer then entered the vehicle without a warrant and searched behind the front seat and found marijuana. We held that the State did not demonstrate articulable facts showing a necessity to search Elison\u2019s vehicle without a warrant, and that the officer\u2019s search of Elison\u2019s vehicle was unconstitutional under Article II, Sections 10 and 11 of the Montana Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-5\">\u00b624 Here, Delao did not place the bottle of vodka out of plain view, nor did Largent perform a search of the vehicle while specifically looking for the bottle of vodka as the officer in <em>Elison </em>specifically searched for the marijuana.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-6\">\u00b625 Delao further argues that Largent had to immediately perceive the bottle in plain view when Largent first questioned him and stood <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>outside his vehicle. Delao relies on language from <em>Sawyer </em>for this proposition. In <em>Sawyer, </em>we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b98-4\">We hold only that where the sole justification for an inventory search is the fact it is incident to the lawful custody of an impounded vehicle and pursuant to standard police procedure, such search must be limited in scope to articles in plain view from outside the vehicle.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b98-5\">\u00b626 First, as we previously noted, <em>Sawyer </em>involved different factual circumstances distinguishable from the present case. Unlike <em>Sawyer, </em>Largent neither impounded Delao\u2019s vehicle, nor did he perform an inventory search.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-6\">\u00b627 Second, in arguing that Largent needed to first perceive the bottle of vodka when he first stood outside the vehicle, Delao misconstrues our holding in <em>Sawyer </em>and the plain view doctrine. Delao overlooks the fact that, under the plain view doctrine, the lawful presence of the officer, in or on the property where the evidence is located, serves as the prerequisite to any seizure of the evidence. Accordingly, when Largent first stood outside Delao\u2019s vehicle, he had no lawfully sufficient reason to enter Delao\u2019s vehicle. However, once Largent placed Delao into custody, Largent had a legally sufficient reason to enter Delao\u2019s vehicle to obtain the keys from the ignition so that he could secure the vehicle. Having met the prerequisite of being lawfully in Delao\u2019s vehicle, the only issue was whether Largent could see the bottle of vodka in plain view from his vantage point inside the vehicle. Thus, whether Largent could see the bottle from outside the vehicle, before he had a lawfully sufficient reason to enter the vehicle, is irrelevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-7\">\u00b628 Similarly, in <em>Loh, </em>officers had a legally sufficient reason to enter Loh\u2019s burning home upon information that some of the occupants had not yet escaped. The question in that case was not whether the officer\u2019s could see Loh\u2019s marijuana plants from outside the house, but rather, whether the marijuana plants appeared in plain view once the officers were legally inside the house. <em>See Loh, </em>275 Mont. at 473, 914 P.2d at 601.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-8\">\u00b629  Largent testified that he leaned into the vehicle to look for the keys in the ignition, and on his way out, he saw a clear bottle partially covered beneath the center armrest. Delao does not dispute this characterization of the location of the bottle. We conclude, as did the trial court, that the bottle of vodka was in plain view once Largent leaned inside the vehicle to search for the keys.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-9\">\u00b630 Largent testified that he immediately perceived the bottle beneath <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>the armrest as one containing liquor. The District Court described the bottle as a \u201cpint flask-shaped bottle.\u201d Undoubtedly, in his training and experience as a highway patrolman, Largent knew that alcohol, unlike any other popular beverage, often comes in flask-shaped bottles. Again, as did the District Court, we defer to the common sense judgment of law enforcement officials in matters such as this. The incriminating nature of the bottle of vodka was immediately apparent.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-4\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b99-5\">\u00b631  In summary, we hold that Largent was lawfully present inside Delao\u2019s vehicle, that the bottle of vodka was in plain view, and that the incriminating nature of the bottle of vodka was immediately apparent. Therefore, the District Court did not err in denying Delao\u2019s motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-6\">\u00b632 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b99-7\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES COTTER, MORRIS and WARNER concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b93-14\"> Although no written policy was offered into evidence, Largent testified about the policy at the suppression hearing and his testimony was undisputed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b97-7\"> Officer Largent did testify that he performed a quick \u201cscan\u201d of the vehicle for items left in the vehicle. This scan did constitute an inventory search; however, the scan took place after the discovery of the bottle of vodka, bore no additional evidence and thus has no bearing on the issue of Delao\u2019s motion to suppress evidence. Additionally, even if Largent scanned the vehicle before finding the bottle, the quick search for valuable items in plain view would not have constituted an illegal search since Largent was lawfully present in Delao\u2019s vehicle and had a lawful reason to perform an inventory search.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
