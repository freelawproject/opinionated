Sampson and Cybulski offered to settle their respective bodily injury claims for the total sum of $125,000.00. NFU rejected the offer. Subsequently, Claimants retained an attorney. After Sampson and Cybulski had incurred approximately $43,500.00 in attorney fee and costs, NFU settled for the previously-demanded sum of $125,000.00. Sampson and Cybulski brought this action in the Thirteenth Judicial District of Yellowstone County, claiming that NFU\u2019s delayed settlement constituted a violation of the Montana Unfair Trade Practices Act (UTPA). They sought recovery of their attorney fees. The District Court granted NFU\u2019s motion for summary judgment. Claimants appeal. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-7\">ISSUE</p>\n<p id=\"b558-8\">\u00b62 The issue on appeal is whether attorney\u2019s fees are recoverable as damages in an action brought under Montana\u2019s Unfair Trade Practices Act, \u00a7\u00a7 33-18-201 and 33-18-242, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-9\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b558-10\">\u00b63 As this case involves a question of law only, a short factual summary is sufficient to provide a foundation for our analysis. In December 1996, Sampson and Cybulski were injured when the car in which they were traveling was struck by Milo Langberg, an insured of NFU. In 2001, an attorney, actingpro <em>bono, </em>presented Claimants\u2019 offer to NFU to settle their claims for $125,000.00. NFU rejected the offer. The <em>pro bono </em>attorney suggested that Sampson and Cybulski retain an attorney with personal injury expertise to represent them in their claim against NFU. Sampson and Cybulski did so. Approximately fourteen months later in May 2002, NFU settled the personal injury claim with the women for $125,000.00. By that time, Claimants had incurred approximately $43,500.00 in attorney fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-11\">\u00b64 In April 2003, Sampson and Cybulski brought this action under the UTPA to recover their attorney fees. Relying upon \u00a7 33-18-242, MCA, Claimants alleged that NFU violated \u00a7 33-18-201(6), MCA, by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>neglecting \u201cto attempt in good faith to effectuate a prompt, fair, and equitable settlement of [Sampson\u2019s and Cybulski\u2019s] claims on which [NFU\u2019s] Lability was reasonably clear.\u201d Sampson and Cybulski also claimed NFU failed to promptly settle Sampson\u2019s claim for property damage for which NFU\u2019s insured\u2019s liability also was reasonably clear, in order to influence settlement of the women\u2019s claim for personal injury damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-4\">\u00b65 NFU moved for summary judgment, arguing that attorney fees are not recoverable as \u201cdamages\u201d unless expressly provided by contract or statute, and that there was no such express provision in this case. In February 2005, the District Court agreed, holding that \u201cattorney fees are not recoverable as an element of damage under the [UTPA].\u201d The court granted NFU\u2019s motion for summary judgment and dismissed Sampson\u2019s and Cybulski\u2019s complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-5\">\u00b66 Sampson and Cybulski filed a timely appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-6\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b559-7\">\u00b67 We review a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment de novo, and apply the same criteria applied by the district court pursuant to Rule 56(c), M. R. Civ. P. A district court properly grants summary judgment only when no genuine issues of material fact exist, and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. <em>Oster v. Valley County, </em>2006 MT 180, \u00b6 9, 333 Mont. 76, \u00b6 9, 140 P.3d 1079, \u00b6 9 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b559-8\">RELEVANT STATUTES</p>\n<p id=\"b559-9\">\u00b68 Section 33-18-201, MCA, provides that unfair claim settlement practices are prohibited. In relevant part, it requires that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b559-10\">No person may, with such frequency as to indicate a general business practice, do any of the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b559-11\">(6) neglect to attempt in good faith to effectuate prompt, fair, and equitable settlements of claims in which liability has become reasonably clear;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b559-12\">(13) fail to promptly settle claims, if liability has become reasonably clear, under one portion of the insurance policy coverage in order to influence settlements under other portions of the insurance policy coverage; or</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b559-13\">\u00b69 Section 33-18-242, MCA, states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b559-14\">(1) An insured or a third-party claimant has an independent cause <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>of action against an insurer for actual damages caused by the insurer\u2019s violation of subsection (1), (4), (5), (6), (9), or (13) of 33-18-201.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b560-4\">(4) In an action under this section, the court or jury may award such damages as were proximately caused by the violation of subsection (1), (4), (5), (6), (9), or (13) of 33-18-201. Exemplary damages may also be assessed in accordance with 27-1-221.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b560-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b560-6\">\u00b610 <em>Are attorney\u2019s fees recoverable as damages in an action brought under Montana\u2019s Unfair Trade Practices Act, \u00a7\u00a7 33-18-201 and 33-18-242, MCA?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b560-7\">\u00b611 Sampson and Cybulski assert that NFU unreasonably rejected their reasonable settlement demand when NFU\u2019s liability was not in dispute. They maintain that such unreasonable action was done in bad faith and was a violation of the UTPA, and that as a result of NFU\u2019s action, NFU forced them to obtain counsel to resolve the matter. They argue that \u00a7 33-18-242, MCA, statutorily entitles them to damages proximately caused by NFU\u2019s bad faith refusal to resolve their claim in a timely, fair and reasonable manner in accordance with \u00a7 33-18-201, MCA. They assert that the sole damages they suffered as a result of NFU\u2019s bad faith actions were the attorney fees incurred during the fourteen months between their settlement demand of $125,000.00 and NFU\u2019s eventual agreement to settle for the same amount.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-8\">\u00b612 Sampson and Cybulski acknowledge that Montana generally follows the American Rule, under which each party to litigation pays his or her own attorney\u2019s fees, even if he or she prevails in the lawsuit. They assert, however, that the American Rule does not bar recovery of attorney fees as a damage for breach of \u00a7 33-18-201, MCA. They maintain that the Legislature did not limit the type of damages recoverable under \u00a7\u00a7 33-18-242(1) and (4), MCA; rather, it drafted an open definition of damages and provided that <em>all damages </em>proximately caused by violations of the Act are recoverable. As a result, Claimants argue that \u00a7 33-18-242, MCA, statutorily authorizes an award of attorney fees providing this Court determines that such fees constitute \u201cdamages.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b560-9\">\u00b613 NFU counters that the American Rule does apply and prohibits awarding attorney fees in this case. It argues generally that without express statutory or contractual authority or the application of one of the four recognized exceptions to the American Rule, none of which are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>present in this case, the Rule prohibits awards of attorney fees. Specifically, NFU contends that when the Legislature enacted \u00a7 33-18-242, MCA, in 1987, it did not mention or authorize attorney fees and that this Court should not add to the statute that which the Legislature omitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-4\">\u00b614 In granting summary judgment, the District Court provided the following analysis: 1) Montana follows the American Rule; therefore, unless there is a contractual provision or a statutory provision for attorney fees or a case falls within one of the four exceptions to the Rule, attorney fees will not be awarded <em>(Goodover v. Lindey\u2019s Inc., </em>255 Mont. 430, 445, 843 P.2d 765, 774 (1993)); 2) there is no contractual or statutory authority allowing attorney fees as an element of damages under the UTPA; 3) one of the exceptions to the American Rule is the \u201cequitable\u201d exception available in situations in which a party is forced into a frivolous lawsuit <em>(Goodover, </em>255 Mont. at 447, 843 P.2d at 775); 4) the Montana Supreme Court has refused to apply the equitable exception to malicious or bad faith claims <em>(Goodover, </em>255 Mont. at 448, 843 P.2d at 777) or to injured third-party beneficiaries of an insurance contract <em>(Mountain West v. Brewer, </em>2003 MT 98, \u00b6 40, 315 Mont. 231, \u00b6 40, 69 P.3d 652, \u00b6 40); 5) the Montana Supreme Court has allowed attorney fees to be awarded to third-party claimants in declaratory judgments under certain circumstances <em>(Brewer, </em>\u00b6 41); and 6) but the case before us is not a declaratory judgment. The District Court therefore determined that there was no authority under which it could award Claimants\u2019 attorney fees as damages under the UTPA.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-5\">\u00b615 As acknowledged by both parties, it is the general rule in Montana that a party is not entitled to attorneys fees absent a specific contractual provision or statutory grant. <em>Martin v. Crown Life Ins. Co., </em>202 Mont. 461, 469, 658 P.2d 1099, 1104, (1983). In the case before us, it is undisputed that no contractual arrangement existed between Sampson and Cybulski and NFU. NFU insured Langberg, not Claimants. We also need not address the four exceptions to the American Rule, as Claimants do not argue for the application of any of the established exceptions. Therefore, we turn our attention to Claimants\u2019 argument that \u00a7 33-18-242, MCA, authorizes an award of all damages proximately caused by an insurer that violates the UTPA, and that attorney fees constitute such damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-6\">\u00b616 Claimants rely in part upon our decision in <em>Morris v. Nationwide Ins. Co., </em>222 Mont. 399, 722 P.2d 628 (1986), contending it supports their contention that attorney fees qualify as damages in bad faith actions. However, it is important to note that this case and another <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>case upon which they rely-Tynes <em>v. Bankers Life Co., </em>224 Mont. 350, 730 P.2d 1115 (1986)-were decided prior to the Legislature\u2019s adoption in 1987 of \u00a7 33-18-242, MCA, which extended the right of recovery for unfair trade practices to third parties. As this is the statute under which Claimants seek the recovery of fees, we must be guided primarily by the provisions of that statute and the cases interpreting it. Moreover, to the limited extent that <em>Morris </em>and <em>Tynes </em>are authoritative, the cases do not aid the Claimants\u2019 position.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-4\">\u00b617 We decided <em>Morris </em>in 1986, the year before the Legislature enacted \u00a7 33-18-242, MCA. Morris sued the Sun River Electric Co-op and its insurer, Nationwide, after a Co-op high voltage line started a fire on Morris\u2019 land and destroyed Morris\u2019 property. Morris argued that Nationwide conducted settlement negotiations in a manner that violated \u00a733-18-201, MCA. The liability claim and bad faith claim were bifurcated. The jury entered a verdict for Morris in the liability case, and the bad faith claim then proceeded to trial. In the bad faith trial, the jury concluded that Nationwide had acted in bad faith and awarded Morris a specific amount in compensatory damages. Additionally, it determined that Morris should be awarded his attorney fees and costs, in an amount to be determined by the district court. The district court subsequently entered an order of fees, but Morris disagreed with the amount awarded, and appealed. Significantly, the issue before us on appeal was <em>not </em>whether Morris should have been awarded attorney fees, as Nationwide did not object to plaintiffs request for an award of fees. Rather, the issue was whether the district court had used an acceptable method for determining such fees. Addressing only the issue raised, we affirmed the fee method calculation used by the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-5\">\u00b618 Subsequently, in December 1986, we decided <em>Tynes. </em>Tynes sued his insurer for breach of contract and tortious breach of the implied covenant of good faith and tortious violation of Montana\u2019s Insurance Code. A jury awarded Tynes considerable damages including punitive damages and damages for emotional distress. After the verdict, Tynes moved for $30,000.00 in attorney\u2019s fees which was granted by the district court. On appeal, we affirmed the jury verdict but vacated the district court\u2019s award of attorney\u2019s fees to Tynes. In so doing, we expressly rejected the district court\u2019s reliance upon the California case of <em>Brandt v. Superior Court (Standard Ins. Co.), </em>693 P.2d 796 (Jan. 1985), for the proposition that, where an insurer\u2019s tortious conduct compels an insured to hire counsel to obtain policy benefits, the insurer should be liable in tort for the expense of retaining counsel. In vacating <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>the fee award, we said: \u201cWe have not adopted this policy in Montana and do not choose to do so today.\u201d <em>Tynes, </em>224 Mont. at 369, 730 P.2d at 1127.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-3\">\u00b619 Since <em>Tynes </em>was decided, we have held that an insured is entitled to recover attorney fees under the \u201cinsurance exception\u201d to the American Rule when the insurer forces the insured to commence legal action to obtain the full benefits of the insurance contract between them; however, we have declined to extend this exception to third party actions, where there is no privity of contract-no \u201cpreviously bargained for benefit\u201d-that the third party was forced into litigation to vindicate. <em>See Brewer, </em>\u00b6 38. We said in <em>Brewer </em>that were we to extend the insurance exception to a third-party claim for attorney fees, we would effectively \u201cdrive a stake into the heart of the American Rule.\u201d <em>Brewer, </em>\u00b6 40. Thus, neither <em>Morris </em>or <em>Tynes </em>as pre-\u00a7 33-18-242, MCA, cases, nor the cases decided since that time insofar as they address the question now before us, are helpful to Claimants\u2019 position</p>\n<p id=\"AF6\">\u00b620 The 1987 Montana legislative session in which the Legislature drafted and enacted \u00a7 33-18-242, MCA, began just after <em>Tynes </em>was decided. As we have stated on numerous occasions, it is presumed that the Legislature is acquainted with the law and is aware of how previous laws have been construed by the Court. <em>Baitis v. Department of Revenue of State, </em>2004 MT 17, \u00b6 24, 319 Mont. 292, \u00b6 24, 83 P.3d 1278, \u00b6 24. Therefore, as we presume the Legislature knew of our decisions in <em>Morris </em>and <em>Tynes </em>when it enacted \u00a7 33-18-242, MCA, it is logical to conclude that had the Legislature felt that <em>Tynes </em>had been wrongly decided, it would have expressly provided for recovery of attorney fees as an element of damages in the language of \u00a7 33-18-242, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-4\">\u00b621 The Legislature is capable of authoring and enacting statutes which clearly permit tort victims to recover attorney fees. <em>See </em>\u00a7 33-25-402(2), MCA (In a civil action based on \u00a7 33-25-401, MCA, and this section, the court may award to the prevailing party court costs plus reasonable attorney fees); \u00a7 25-9-404, MCA (A judgment must order payment of attorney fees and litigation expenses separately from an order for periodic payments of future damages); \u00a7 30-4A-305(5), MCA (Reasonable attorney fees are recoverable if demand for compensation under subsection (1) or (2) is made and refused before an action is brought on the claim); and \u00a7 22-1-1111, MCA (Reasonable attorney fees and the costs of bringing the action may be awarded to the prevailing party). This being so, we will not engage in a presumption that the Legislature intended fees as an element of damages but simply <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>neglected to so specify.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-4\">\u00b622  While we recognize the seeming unfairness of the Claimants\u2019 having to pay $43,500.00 for the privilege of recovering the same amount of money they were willing to accept in the first place, we are nonetheless constrained by the terms of the statute and our role in interpreting it. The Legislature did not construct the UTPA to provide for the recovery of attorney fees and therefore we cannot construe it to do so. Section 1-2-101, MCA (In the construction of a statute, the office of the judge is simply to ascertain and declare what is in terms or in substance contained therein, not to insert what has been omitted or to omit what has been inserted).</p>\n<p id=\"b564-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b564-6\">\u00b623 For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the District Court.</p>\n<judges id=\"b564-7\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES NELSON, WARNER, LEAPHART, RICE and MORRIS concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
