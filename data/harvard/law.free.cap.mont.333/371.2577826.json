The claim alleged civil rights violations stemming from the Officers\u2019 failure to knock and announce their presence before entering Cassady\u2019s home, and the Officers\u2019 alleged excessive use of force against Cassady. The Thirteenth Judicial District Court, Yellowstone County, determined as a matter of law that the Officers were entitled to qualified immunity. Cassady appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-11\">\u00b62 We consider the following issues on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b398-12\">\u00b63 1) Did the District Court commit error when it granted the Officers qualified immunity from Cassady\u2019s \u00a7 1983 claim based on the Officers\u2019 failure to knock and announce their presence?</p>\n<p id=\"b398-14\">\u00b64 2) Did the District Court commit error when it determined that the Officers did not use excessive force and, consequently, were entitled to qualified immunity from Cassady\u2019s \u00a7 1983 claim?</p>\n<p id=\"b398-16\">FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b398-17\">\u00b65 What began as a violent incident between father and son one evening in Broadview, Montana, ended the next morning with a SWAT team firing tear gas to remove a shooting victim from his own home.</p>\n<p id=\"AGL\">\u00b66 Cassady and his then seventeen-year old son, Robert Cassady (RJ), lived in the back portion of a building in which Cassady also operated the Broadview Bar, in Yellowstone County. Cassady and RJ initially argued on the evening of May 8, 2001, before the incident escalated into physical violence. RJ retreated to the house of his friend and neighbor, Robert Conover (Conover), after the fight. RJ told Conover that the altercation ended when he had hit his father repeatedly over the head with a baseball bat, and that he did not know whether Cassady was dead or alive. Cassady\u2019s blood soaked RJ\u2019s pants. Conover, a first responder, drove to Tim Hancock\u2019s (Hancock) house <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>and requested Hancock accompany him to the Broadview Bar to check on Cassady\u2019s welfare. Conover and Hancock entered the building and announced their presence. They found Cassady talking on the phone. Conover inquired whether Cassady was all right, and Cassady responded, \u201cFm walking, I\u2019m talking, that\u2019s all, does it look like I\u2019m all right?\u201d Cassady then ordered the men to leave the premises. They complied.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-3\">\u00b67 Conover returned home and called 911. He informed the police what he knew of the evening\u2019s events, including Hancock\u2019s observation that he saw a shotgun in Cassady\u2019s home. Deputy Skillen, Deputy Wegner, and Sergeant Wallis of the Yellowstone County Sheriffs Department arrived at Conover\u2019s home. The Officers interviewed Conover and RJ and learned that Cassady had sustained head injuries from a baseball bat and that he had been drinking alcohol. Dispatch also informed the Officers that Cassady had a \u201chistory of gunplay.\u201d The Officers stated that they proceeded to the Cassady residence to check on Cassady\u2019s medical status and investigate further the circumstances surrounding the incident with RJ.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-4\">\u00b68 Dispatch called Conover after the Officers left to ask if Conover had a key to the Cassady residence. RJ provided Conover a key to his home for the Officers\u2019 use. RJ told Conover to inform the Officers that they needed to announce themselves when they entered the bar or else his father would think that they were burglars. Lieutenant Schieno, also of the Yellowstone County Sherriffs Department, appeared at the Conover residence. Conover met him outside and gave him RJ\u2019s key. Officer Schieno asked Conover twice if the Officers had RJ\u2019s permission to enter the home. Conover confirmed that the Officers did have RJ\u2019s permission to enter his home. Conover neglected, however, to relay RJ\u2019s warning that the Officers needed to announce themselves.</p>\n<p id=\"AzE\">\u00b69 The Officers arrived at the Cassady residence and requested that dispatch call Cassady and ask him to come outside to discuss what had happened with his son. Dispatch called Cassady twice. He did not answer the phone. Conover\u2019s wife, Ann, testified later that Cassady was talking to her on the phone intermittently during these hours.</p>\n<p id=\"ADs\">\u00b610 The parties dispute what happened next. Three of the four Officers\u2019 affidavits state that they shined flashlights in the windows and announced themselves as law enforcement while they walked the building\u2019s perimeter. One of these Officer\u2019s taped statements, taken the morning after the incident, included this information. Cassady\u2019s affidavit contains no mention of flashlights or announcements coming from outside his home. Cassady\u2019s affidavit states that he had retired <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>to his residence when he \u201cheard intruders enter the bar.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b400-4\">\u00b611 The Officers had decided to enter the building through the front door with their weapons drawn. Officer Schieno used the front door key provided by Conover, discovered that turning the key had actually locked the door, and unlocked it again. The Officers did not knock or announce their presence as they entered through the front door. The Officers\u2019 taped statements and affidavits consistently relayed that the group entered the building \u201cvery quietly,\u201d and were making a conscious effort to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-5\">\u00b612 The room where the Officers entered was dark. Deputies Skillen and Wegner proceeded to the right, while Lieutenant Schieno and Sergeant Wallis moved to the left. Wallis and Schieno immediately noticed a laser light targeted on Schieno\u2019s face. The Officers knew the laser to be consistent with a gun sight device. What Officers described as \u201clots of verbalization\u201d occurred during the next few moments. The Officers announced repeatedly and loudly that they were the Sheriffs Department, and continually ordered Cassady to drop his weapon. Cassady ignored the Officers\u2019 demands and maintained the laser sight on Schieno. Wallis fired his gun in Cassady\u2019s direction.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-6\">\u00b613 The Officers then retreated from the building. When Cassady did not emerge, they established a perimeter and medical staging area outside the building. Law enforcement\u2019s attempts to communicate with Cassady and convince him to leave the building throughout the night were unsuccessful. The Yellowstone County SWAT team eventually shot tear gas into the residence around five o\u2019clock the next morning. Cassady emerged, and law enforcement transported him to a local hospital where he received treatment for a gunshot wound to his abdomen, for a bullet fragment in his upper right chest, and for multiple injuries he sustained from the encounter with his son. Law enforcement transferred Cassady again later in the day to the Yellowstone County Detention Facility. They charged him with felony assault on a peace officer and family partner member assault.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-7\">\u00b614 Cassady entered a plea of not guilty on both charges. He did not pay the $200,000 bail and remained in the county jail. Cassady moved the court to reduce his bail to $50,000 on August 27, 2001, after serving 110 days in jail. The court granted his motion. Cassady posted bail and the court set trial for January 22, 2002. The State dismissed the partner family member assault charge immediately preceding trial. The jury found Cassady not guilty of felony assault on a peace officer following a four-day trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-8\">\u00b615 Cassady then brought a civil action against Yellowstone County <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>and the Officers. The action included a \u00a7 1983 claim that stated generally that the defendants \u201cviolated plaintiffs civil rights and deprived him of his rights under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983.\u201d The District Court analyzed the \u00a7 1983 claim under both the United States Constitution and Montana case law. Cassady\u2019s complaint also claimed that the Officers committed various other torts against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-3\">\u00b616 The court granted the Officers\u2019 summary judgment motion to dismiss some of the tort claims, and granted the Officers qualified immunity for the \u00a7 1983 claim. Cassady\u2019s claims for negligence, assault, and negligent infliction of emotional distress proceeded to a four-day trial. The jury issued a defense verdict. Cassady now appeals the order granting qualified immunity to the Officers for the \u00a7 1983 claim based on the alleged constitutional violations arising from the Officers\u2019 failure to knock and announce and their alleged use of excessive force.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-4\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b401-5\">\u00b617 We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s decision to grant qualified immunity. <em>Losleben v. Oppedahl, </em>2004 MT 5, \u00b6 13, 319 Mont. 269, \u00b6 13, 83 P.3d 1271, \u00b6 13. We also review <em>de novo </em>the issue of whether exigent circumstances exist. <em>State v. Anyan, </em>2004 MT 395, \u00b6 18, 325 Mont. 245, \u00b6 18, 104 P.3d 511, \u00b6 18 (citing <em>United States v. Furrow </em>(9th Cir. 2001), 256 F.3d 805, 811).</p>\n<p id=\"b401-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b401-7\">\u00b618  Qualified immunity is \u201can <em>immunity from suit </em>rather than a mere defense to liability,\u201d and, consequently, \u201cit is effectively lost if a case is erroneously permitted to go to trial.\u201d <em>Saucier v. Katz </em>(2001), 533 U.S. 194, 200-01, 121 S.Ct. 2151, 2155-56, 150 L.Ed.2d 272. Qualified immunity seeks to \u201cavoid excessive disruption of government and permit the resolution of many insubstantial claims on summary judgment.\u201d <em>Saucier, </em>533 U.S. at 202, 121 S.Ct. at 2156. Thus, the court must engage in a two-part test to determine whether government officials are entitled to qualified immunity for a claim brought pursuant to \u00a7 1983, so that the issue of immunity can be resolved \u201cat the earliest possible stage in litigation.\u201d <em>Saucier, </em>533 U.S. at 201, 121 S.Ct. at 2156, (citing <em>Hunter v. Bryant </em>(1991), 502 U.S. 224, 112 S.Ct. 534, 116 L.Ed.2d 589.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-8\">\u00b619 The court must determine initially if, when viewed in the light most favorable to the party asserting the injury, the offending conduct violated a constitutional right. <em>Losleben, </em>\u00b6 14; <em>Saucier, </em>533 U.S. at 201, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>121 S.Ct. at 2156. Only when the conduct violated plaintiffs constitutional right should the court then proceed to ask whether the constitutional right was clearly established at the time of the violation in light of the specific context of the case. <em>Saucier, </em>533 U.S. at 201, 121 S.Ct. at 2156. If the officer\u2019s actions were objectively reasonable given the circumstances, summary judgment based on qualified immunity is appropriate. <em>Saucier, </em>533 U.S. at 205, 121 S.Ct. at 2158.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-4\">ISSUE ONE</p>\n<p id=\"b402-5\">\u00b620 Did the District Court commit error when it granted the Officers qualified immunity from Cassady\u2019s \u00a7 1983 claim based on the Officers\u2019 alleged failure to knock and announce their presence?</p>\n<p id=\"b402-6\">\u00b621 a) Did Officers violate Cassady\u2019s constitutional right to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures and his constitutional right to privacy when they failed to knock and announce their presence as they conducted a warrantless entry into his home with their weapons drawn?</p>\n<p id=\"b402-7\">\u00b622 The Officers claim that the presence of both exigent circumstances and consent obviated the knock and announce requirement and, consequently, they did not violate Cassady\u2019s constitutional rights when they entered his home unannounced. The Officers claim alternatively that if the law did in fact require them to knock and announce, they substantially complied with the rule before entering Cassady\u2019s home.</p>\n<p id=\"ADI\">\u00b623 We note initially that the District Court\u2019s order states that it is \u201cundisputed that the [Officers] failed to announce their presence prior to entry into [Cassady\u2019s] residence.\u201d The Officers\u2019 brief states, however, that they substantially complied with knock and announce when they \u201cshouted at Cassady from outside the bar, shined flashlights in the windows, knocked on the door and had dispatch telephone Cassady repeatedly.\u201d The Officers\u2019 motion for summary judgment does not include a substantial compliance argument. As such, the Officers failed to present this theory in the District Court, and we will not consider it for the first time on appeal. <em>Bekkedahl v. McKittrick, </em>2002 MT 250, \u00b6\u00b6 31-32, 312 Mont. 156, \u00b6\u00b6 31-32, 58 P.3d 175, \u00b6\u00b6 31-32.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-8\">\u00b624 In <em>Anyan, </em>we determined that law enforcement officers violated various defendants\u2019 constitutional rights to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures when the officers failed to knock and announce their presence when executing a warrant on a drug house. <em>Anyan, </em>\u00b6 2. The case represented the first time this Court considered the knock and announce rule\u2019s application in the context of criminal law. <em>Anyan, </em>\u00b6 20. We recognized that concerns for privacy, reduction in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>potential for violence, and preventing the destruction of private citizens\u2019 property as the underlying policies requiring law enforcement to knock and announce their presence. <em>Anyan, </em>\u00b6 22.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-3\">\u00b625 We consequently established the rule that \u201can officer serving a search warrant must comply with the knock and announce requirement unless there are exigent circumstances present ....\u201d <em>Anyan, </em>\u00b6 33. We noted that we rendered our decision pursuant to the Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution and federal authority, but that since Article II, Sections 10 and 11 of the Montana Constitution provide even greater privacy protections than the federal constitution, the Montana Constitution provided an independent basis for our holding that the forced entry and subsequent search were unreasonable. <em>Anyan, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 20, 61.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-4\">\u00b626 We must now address a situation where officers entered a private residence without a warrant and did not knock and announce their presence. In doing so, we deem the same policy considerations applicable whether law enforcement enter a home under an exception to the warrant requirement or whether officers enter armed with a warrant. We also recognize an additional policy reason for requiring law enforcement to knock and announce when they do not have a warrant that we did not articulate in <em>Anyan: </em>the occupant\u2019s opportunity to comply.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-5\">\u00b627  First, we deem the potential privacy violation greater where police enter a residence without a warrant because law enforcement\u2019s entry into the home is not inevitable as it is in situations where police hold a warrant. <em>See Richards v. Wisconsin </em>(1997) 520 U.S. 385, 393 n.5, 117 S.Ct. 1416, 1421 n. 5, 137 L.Ed.2d 615 (referring to the \u201cbrief interlude between announcement and entry with a warrant....\u201d); <em>Hudson v. Michigan </em>(2006), 126 S.Ct. 2159, 2006 WL 1640577 (stating that the interests protected by knock and announce \u201cdo not include the shielding of potential evidence from the government's eyes.\u201d). Further, when the police enter warrantless, the privacy interest protected by the knock and announce rule integrates with the interest in providing the occupant the opportunity to comply with the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-6\">\u00b628 In <em>Wilson, </em>514 U.S. 927, 115 S.Ct. 1914, the Court recognized that providing individuals the opportunity to comply represented one foundation of the knock and announce requirement at common law. Common law courts required law enforcement officers to identify themselves and \u201cmake request to open doors ... for perhaps he did not know of the process, of which, if he had notice, it is to be presumed that he would obey it....\u201d <em>Wilson, </em>514 U.S. at 931-32, 115 S.Ct. at 1917 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>(citing <em>Semayne\u2019s Case </em>(K.B. 1603), 5 Co. Rep. 91a, 91b, 77 Eng. Rep. 194, 195-96). <em>See also Richards, </em>520 U.S. at 393 n.5, 117 S.Ct. at 1421 n. 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-4\">\u00b629 The reduction in the potential for violence provides an additional policy reason that applies equally when officers enter a private residence unannounced either with or without a warrant. Expanding on the purpose of the knock and announce rule to diminish the potential for violence, we noted that unannounced breaking and entering into a home \u201ccould quite easily lead an individual to believe that his safety was in peril and cause him to take defensive measures which he otherwise would not have taken\u201d had he known that a warrant had been issued to search his home. <em>Anyan, </em>\u00b6 23 (citing <em>State v. Bamber, </em>(Fla. 1994), 630 So.2d 1048, 1050); <em>See also Hudson, </em>126 S.Ct. at 2165 (stating that one of the interests in the knock and announce rule \u201cis the protection of human life and limb, because an unannounced entry may provoke violence in supposed self-defense by the surprised resident.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b404-5\">\u00b630 The present case represents the consummate example of when officer compliance with the knock and announce rule would address privacy concerns, provide the opportunity for the homeowner to comply with law enforcement, and also reduce the potential for violence. Officer Wallis\u2019s affidavit stated that the purpose for entry into the residence \u201cwas two-fold: first, a welfare check was in order due to the reports of injury and our inability to communicate with Dan Cassady and, second, to further the investigation into the altercation.\u201d Officer compliance with knock and announce would have afforded Cassady the opportunity to answer the door, and simultaneously provided the Officers the opportunity to accomplish peacefully the purposes of their presence at his home. In fact, law enforcement may never have had to enter his home and invade his privacy at all.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-6\">\u00b631  In light of this reasoning, we conclude that an officer must comply with the knock and announce requirement when he or she enters a home without a warrant unless exigent circumstances exist that would present a threat of physical violence or the likelihood that evidence would be destroyed. <em>See Anyan, </em>\u00b6 33. Exigent circumstances to justify a warrantless entry, however, may not always obviate the knock and announce requirement. Law enforcement and courts still must evaluate the circumstances in each situation on a case by case basis, adhering to the \u201cflexible requirement of reasonableness\u201d implicated whenever law enforcement interests are present. <em>Wilson, </em>514 U.S. at 934, 115 S.Ct. at 1918.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>\u00b632 We turn now to the issue of whether exigent circumstances obviated the knock and announce requirement under the present circumstances. The government bears the burden of proving that exigent circumstances existed, and an \u201cunjustified yet sincere belief in exigent circumstances does not justify non-compliance with the knock and announce rule.\u201d <em>Anyan, </em>\u00b6 34. We have applied the same definition of exigent circumstances to warrantless entries as we have to exceptions to the knock and announce rule. <em>Compare Anyan, </em>\u00b6 34 (defining exigent circumstances serving as exceptions to the knock and announce rule), <em>with State v. Saxton, </em>2003 MT 105, \u00b6 26, 315 Mont. 315, \u00b6 26, 68 P.3d 721, \u00b6 26 (defining exigent circumstances serving as exceptions to the warrant requirement in addition to probable cause).</p>\n<p id=\"Ao3\">\u00b633 Exigent circumstances are those circumstances that \u201cwould cause a reasonable person to believe that entry (or other relevant prompt action) was necessary to prevent physical harm to the officers or other person, the destruction of relevant evidence, the escape of a suspect, or some other consequence improperly frustrating legitimate law enforcement efforts.\u201d <em>Anyan, </em>\u00b6 34. The Officers here never have asserted a concern that Cassady would escape, destroy relevant evidence, or otherwise frustrate their efforts. Officer safety then remains the sole potential exigent circumstance.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-3\">\u00b634  Although \u201cperil to officers may well demonstrate an exigency, mere unspecified fears about that possibility will not.\u201d <em>Anyan, </em>\u00b6 43. Even if the officers have actual knowledge that firearms are within a residence, such information standing alone is insufficient to create an exigency. <em>Anyan, </em>\u00b6 44. Nonetheless, a criminal record reflecting violent tendencies, or a verified reputation of a suspect\u2019s violent nature can be sufficient information to forego knock and announce procedures. <em>Anyan, </em>\u00b6 44. And most importantly, courts must consider the totality of the circumstances when analyzing a knock and announce case involving exigent circumstances. For example, in <em>Richards, </em>520 U.S. at 395, 117 S.Ct. at 1422, the Court rejected Wisconsin\u2019s blanket exception to the knock and announce requirement in felony drug cases, despite the fact that the cases customarily present exigent circumstances. The Court rendered it the courts\u2019 duty to \u201cdetermine whether the facts and circumstances of the particular entry justified dispensing with the knock-and-announce requirement.\u201d Richards, 520 U.S. at 395, 117 S.Ct. at 1422.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-4\">\u00b635 Thus, the knowledge that Cassady had a shotgun inside his home-standing alone-does not justify Officers\u2019 noncompliance with the knock and announce rule. <em>Anyan, </em>\u00b6 44. Dispatch had informed the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>Officers, however, that Cassady had a \u201chistory of gunplay.\u201d The Officers learned further details of Cassady\u2019s gunplay history when Conover told them that Cassady had shot at teenagers peering in the windows of his bar. On the other hand, Officers also knew that Cassady had not threatened Conover and Hancock when they had checked on him earlier in the evening, and that Cassady had no record of threatening law enforcement. Finally, the Officers reported that the purposes of their visit to Cassady\u2019s home were to conduct both a welfare check and to question him about the fight with his son. Neither task inherently triggers a concern for officer safety.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-4\">\u00b636  We must view the facts alleged in the light most favorable to Cassady. Taking the facts alleged and the law together, we must assess the situation faced by the Officers. In considering the totality of these circumstances, we conclude that any possibility of Cassady demonstrating violence against the Officers did not rise to the level of relieving the Officers of their constitutional duty to knock and announce their presence. The Officers failed to carry the burden that exigent circumstances obviated the necessity to knock and announce in the circumstances of the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-5\">\u00b637 The Officers also argue that the consent RJ granted them to enter the home rendered compliance with the knock and announce rule unnecessary. The Officers cite <em>U.S. v. Hatfield </em>(4th Cir. 2004), 365 F.3d 332, in support of this argument. We note initially that the Fourth Circuit applied the federal constitution in <em>Hatfield, </em>and that the Montana Constitution provides additional privacy protections not found in the federal constitution. <em>See </em>Article II, \u00a7\u00a7 10, 11, Mont. Const.; <em>Anyan, </em>\u00b6 61. Moreover, the circumstances in <em>Hatfield </em>are distinguishable from the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-6\">\u00b638 In <em>Hatfield, </em>the court reviewed an order suppressing evidence authorities gathered when they appeared at Hatfield\u2019s house to serve a state felony warrant for his arrest and knocked, but did not identify themselves as law enforcement. <em>Hatfield, 365 F.3d </em>at 334. Hatfield, from inside his home, voluntarily responded to the knock at the door with \u201c[t]he door is open; come on in.\u201d <em>Hatfield, </em>365 F.3d at 340. The reviewing court concluded that Hatfield\u2019s consent eliminated any Fourth Amendment violations with regard to the officers\u2019 entry into his home. <em>Hatfield, </em>365 F.3d at 340-41.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-7\">\u00b639 We consider the fact that RJ had provided his consent, indirectly through Conover, while he was at Conover\u2019s house down the road, rather than from inside the home, as significant in the instant case. Consent granted from a person not physically present in the home that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>law enforcement seek to enter does not fulfill the purposes of the knock and announce requirement. RJ\u2019s consent did not render Cassady aware that law enforcement was on his property, that he was not in peril, and that he did not need to take defensive measures that he otherwise may not have taken. <em>SeeAnyan, </em>\u00b6 23. This Court has never held-nor do we now-that consent given that may serve as an exception to the warrant requirement automatically renders compliance with the knock and announce rule unnecessary. Thus, the Officers\u2019 \u201cdamned if they did [enter], damned if they didn\u2019t [enter]\u201d argument promulgated during oral argument confuses the method of entry with the legality of the entry.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-3\">\u00b640 Moreover, RJ qualified any consent he gave, indirectly through Conover, with his advice that Conover warn any of the Officers entering the home to \u201cmake sure that you announce yourself when you go in the door ... or dad will think it\u2019s a burglar.\u201d RJ did not consent to the activity here-law enforcement\u2019s stealth entry into Cassady\u2019s home without informing Cassady of their identity and purpose. We reject the Officers\u2019 argument that the indirect consent that they received from RJ before entering the home alleviated the Officers\u2019 duty to knock and announce under the present circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-4\">\u00b641  The Officers here had every opportunity to identify themselves and request entry. In light of our decision in <em>Any an, </em>the enhanced privacy rights in Sections 10 and 11 of the Montana Constitution, the lack of exigent circumstances, lack of a warrant, and the Officers\u2019 failed consent argument, we conclude that the Officers violated Cassady\u2019s constitutional rights under the Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution when they entered his home without announcing their presence. As we noted in Any cm, however, Article II, Sections 10 and 11 of the Montana Constitution provide even greater privacy protections than the federal constitution, and consequently, the Montana Constitution serves as an independent basis for our holding. <em>SeeAnyan, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 20, 61. This conclusion, however, does not end our analysis. We now turn to the issue of whether the Officers\u2019 failure to knock and announce was reasonable for purposes of determining qualified immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-5\">\u00b642 b) Was the knock and announce rule clearly established in the context of the situation the Officers confronted when entering Cassady\u2019s home?</p>\n<p id=\"b407-6\">\u00b643  A constitutional right is clearly established if it would be clear to a reasonable officer that his or her conduct was unlawful in the situation he or she confronted. <em>Saucier, </em>533 U.S. at 202, 121 S.Ct. at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>2156. The Officers conceded at oral argument that the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Wilson, </em>514 U.S. 927, 115 S.Ct. 1914, had clearly established knock and announce. We must examine the Officers\u2019 conduct in light of the circumstances the Officers confronted specifically in Broadview on May 8,2001, however, and not \u201cas a broad general proposition.\u201d <em>Saucier, </em>533 U.S. at 201, 121 S.Ct. at 2156. And although an \u201cunjustified yet sincere belief in exigent circumstances does not justify non-compliance with the knock and announce rule,\u201d <em>Anyan, </em>\u00b6 44, the same principle does not apply for the purpose of analyzing the second prong of qualified immunity. A sincere but unjustified belief would entitle officers to qualified immunity in light of the fact that law enforcement may make \u201creasonable mistakes as to the legality of their actions\u201d and still enjoy qualified immunity. <em>Saucier, </em>533 U.S. at 206, 121 S.Ct. at 2159.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-4\">\u00b644 An array of factors culminated in Broadview that evening that could have led reasonable officers to mistakenly believe that compliance with the knock and announce rale was unnecessary. These factors include Cassady\u2019s unresponsiveness when the Officers attempted to contact him, and RJ\u2019s indirect permission to enter the home.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-5\">\u00b645 The Officers did not know Cassady\u2019s exact medical status by the time they arrived at his home, but they did know that he had sustained significant blood loss from the blows RJ had inflicted with the baseball bat. Cassady failed to answer phone calls that dispatch placed to his home, and he did not emerge from the residence when the Officers shined lights in the windows. Thus, it was reasonable for the Officers to interpret Cassady\u2019s unresponsiveness as signifying that Cassady was physically unable to respond, either because he was unconscious or dead. The Officers reasonably believed that knocking and announcing their presence was unnecessary in the situation they confronted.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-6\">\u00b646  It was equally reasonable for the Officers to interpret Cassady\u2019s unresponsiveness to mean that Cassady was \u201clying in wait\u201d for them. The Officers knew that Cassady was very angry, had sustained head injuries, and that he had been drinking alcohol. Dispatch had also informed them that Cassady had once shot at people on his property. Coupled with his perceived unresponsiveness at the Officers\u2019 attempts <em>to contact him, we deem the </em>Officers\u2019 determination that Cassady was on the offensive that evening as reasonable. The Officers held the reasonable belief that entering the home in stealth mode would increase officer safety in the circumstances presented, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>thereby serving as an exigent exception to the knock and announce requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-3\">\u00b647 Finally, RJ\u2019s indirect consent could have led a reasonable officer to mistakenly believe that they did not need to comply with the knock and announce rule. The fact that the Officers held a key to the front door could have led them to conclude that they had received not only the authority to enter, but also the authority to do so unannounced. The better practice would have been for the Officers to have obtained consent from an authorized person on the premises that the Officers want to search, or at least directly from RJ. Nevertheless, we cannot attribute fault to the Officers for Conover\u2019s failure to inform them that RJ premised his consent, given through Conover, on the condition that the Officers identify themselves before entry. <em>See also </em>discussion at \u00b6 39, above.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-4\">\u00b648 We are mindful of our duty to analyze the second prong of the <em>Saucier </em>test by examining the specific context of the situation confronting the Officers in Broadview that evening, and not as a mere theoretical exercise. <em>See Saucier, </em>533 U.S. at 201-02, 121 S.Ct. at 2156. The Supreme Court recently reiterated this point in <em>Brosseau v. Haugen </em>(2004), 543 U.S. 194, 199, 125 S.Ct. 596, 599, 160 L.Ed.2d 583, when it deemed it error for the Ninth Circuit to apply the general tests for excessive use of force from <em>Tennessee v. Garner </em>(1985), 471 U.S. 1, 105 S.Ct. 1694, 85 L.Ed.2d 1, and <em>Graham v. Connor </em>(1989), 490 U.S. 386, 109 S.Ct. 1865, 104 L.Ed.2d 443, to conclude that an officer was not entitled to qualified immunity from a plaintiffs \u00a7 1983 claim. Instead, the Court remanded to consider whether the law was clearly established in a more \u2018\u201cparticularized sense\u2019\u201d to answer the question of qualified immunity. <em>Brosseau, </em>543 U.S. at 199, 125 S.Ct. at 599. <em>See also United States v. Banks </em>(2003), 540 U.S. 31, 41-42, 124 S.Ct. 521, 528, 157 L.Ed.2d 343 (criticizing the Ninth Circuit for distorting the totality of the circumstances principle and replacing it with a \u201cfour-part scheme\u201d for analyzing whether exigent circumstances presented an exception to the knock and announce rule).</p>\n<p id=\"b409-5\">\u00b649  In light of this direction, we conclude that it was reasonable for the Officers to believe that their conduct was lawful in the particular circumstances that they confronted in Broadview that evening. <em>Brosseau, </em>543 U.S. at 199, 125 S.Ct. at 599. These circumstances included Cassady\u2019s perceived unresponsiveness, and the apparent, but nonetheless insufficient, consent that the Officers had received from one of the home\u2019s residents. See \u00b6 39, above. The Officers are consequently entitled to qualified immunity from Cassady\u2019s \u00a7 1983 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>claim. <em>Saucier, </em>533 U.S. at 202, 121 S.Ct. at 2156.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-4\">ISSUE TWO</p>\n<p id=\"b410-5\">\u00b650 Did the District Court commit error when it determined that the Officers did not use excessive force and, consequently, were entitled to qualified immunity from Cassady\u2019s \u00a7 1983 claim?</p>\n<p id=\"b410-6\">\u00b651 Cassady premised a portion of his \u00a7 1983 claim on allegations that the Officers used excessive force against him when Wallis shot Cassady. Cassady argues on appeal that the Officers\u2019 alleged unlawful entry cannot be divorced from the excessive force claim. Cassady asserts that the Officers\u2019 failure to knock and announce transformed the Officers\u2019 subsequent force into an automatic violation of his constitutional rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-7\">\u00b652 Cassady fails to cite any authority, however, in support of this argument. Further, the Supreme Court has demonstrated a recent tendency to analyze the method of entry separate from subsequent events. For example, in <em>Hudson, </em>126 S.Ct. at 2159, the Court concluded that the exclusionary rule did not apply to evidence obtained from officers\u2019 illegal entry into defendant\u2019s home when the officers violated the knock and announce rule. The Court\u2019s analysis included the reasoning, <em>inter alia, </em>that <em>\u201cmanner </em>of entry was <em>not </em>a but-for cause of obtaining the evidence.\u201d <em>Hudson, </em>126 S.Ct. at 2164. We reject Cassady\u2019s contention that the method of entry somehow affects the manner in which we analyze the Officers\u2019 actions after entry. We turn then to the Officers\u2019 actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-8\">\u00b653  The Fourth Amendment permits a police officer to use only such force as is objectively reasonable under the circumstances. <em>Graham, </em>490 U.S. at 395, 109 S.Ct. at 1871. An officer\u2019s use of deadly force is reasonable if the officer has probable cause to believe that the suspect posed a significant threat of death or serious physical injury to the officer or others. <em>Garner, </em>471 U.S. at 11-12, 105 S.Ct. 1694 at 1701; <em>see also </em>\u00a7 45-3-102, MCA (providing that a person \u201cis justified in the use of force likely to cause death or serious bodily harm only if he reasonably believes that such force is necessary to prevent imminent death or serious bodily harm to himself or another ...\u201d). Courts should determine the reasonableness of a particular use of force from a reasonable officer on the scene\u2019s perspective, and not with the 20/20 vision of hindsight. <em>Any an, </em>\u00b6 47 (citing <em>Banks, </em>540 U.S. at 39, 124 S.Ct. at 527).</p>\n<p id=\"b410-9\">\u00b654  Wallis observed a laser sight on Schieno\u2019s face immediately upon the Officers\u2019 entry into the home. Wallis knew that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>the laser likely originated from a gun aimed at his partner. The Officers identified themselves as law enforcement and ordered Cassady repeatedly to drop his weapon. Cassady nonetheless maintained the laser on Schieno. Wallis then shot at Cassady. Wallis had probable cause to believe that Cassady posed a significant threat of injuring Schieno, and Wallis shot at Cassady to prevent serious bodily harm to his partner. <em>Garner, </em>471 U.S. at 11, 105 S.Ct. at 1701; \u00a7 45-3-102, MCA. We 6conclude that the Officers did not use excessive force against Cassady and, consequently, did not violate Cassadys constitutional rights. Cassady has failed to establish the first prong of the <em>Saucier </em>test in that the Officers did not violate his constitutional rights. Thus, the District Court did not err when it granted the Officers qualified immunity for Cassadys \u00a7 1983 claim premised on the Officers\u2019 alleged use of excessive force. <em>See Saucier, </em>533 U.S. at 200-01, 121 S.Ct. at 2155-56.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-3\">\u00b655 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b411-4\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES WARNER, COTTER and LEAPHART concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b411-5\">JUSTICE RICE</author>\n<p id=\"AOC\">concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-6\">\u00b656 I disagree with the Court\u2019s assessment of the circumstances leading to the covert entry. The circumstances presented a sufficient threat to the officers\u2019 safety to justify their determination to make a no-knock entry. <em>In Any an, </em>we said the following about whether safety concerns amount to \u201cexigent circumstances\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b411-7\">\u201c[T]he presence of a weapon creates an exigent circumstance, provided the government is able to prove they possessed information that the suspect was armed and likely to use a weapon or become violent. Evidence that firearms are within a residence, by itself, is not sufficient to create an exigency to officers when executing a warrant. However, threats to an officer\u2019s safety, a criminal record reflecting violent tendencies, or a verified reputation of a suspect\u2019s violent nature can be enough to provide law enforcement officers with justification to forego the necessity of knocking and announcing their presence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b411-8\"><em>Bates, </em>84 F.3d at 795 (internal citations omitted). \u201cA concern for police safety must be based upon prior knowledge or direct observation that the subject of the search keeps weapons and that such person has a known propensity to use them.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b411-9\"><em>Anyan, </em>\u00b6 44. In <em>State v. Ochadleus, </em>2005 MT 88, 326 Mont. 441, 110 P.3d 448, we instructed that officers may make a no-knock entry when <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>they had a \u201creasonable suspicion of exigency.\u201d <em>Ochadleus, </em>\u00b6 56.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-4\">\u00b657 Here, it was known that Cassady had a weapon, had a \u201chistory of gunplay,\u201d had fired at others before, had earlier been in a violent fight with his son, had taken blows to the head that evening, and may have been intoxicated. One can quibble with whether the decision to proceed covertly was the <em>best </em>exercise of judgment, but given these conditions, it was certainly <em>reasonable </em>\u201cto believe that entry ... was necessary to prevent physical harm to the officers <em>...\u201d Anyan, </em>\u00b6 34.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-5\">\u00b658 Thus, the officers judgment to proceed covertly was justified by circumstances giving rise to a reasonable suspicion of exigency that threatened their safety. Therefore, I concur in the Court\u2019s decision but disagree with its rationale, and I would not reach the second prong of the qualified immunity inquiry. On Issue Two, I agree with the Court\u2019s analysis of the excessive force claim.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b412-6\">JUSTICE NELSON</author>\n<p id=\"ARX\">specially concurs.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-7\">\u00b659 I concur in the result we reach today, but not in all of the Court\u2019s reasoning.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-8\">\u00b660 First, with respect to Cassady\u2019s knock-and-announce claim, I agree with the Court that the Officers\u2019 failure to knock and announce their presence prior to entering Cassady\u2019s home violated his constitutional right to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures. As we explained in <em>State v. Anyan, </em>2004 MT 395, 325 Mont. 245, 104 P.3d 511,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-9\">a mere suspicion that weapons would be at a residence does not provide an exigency for the officers\u2019 failure to properly knock and announce their presence. \u201cOur cases have made it clear that generalized fears about how drug dealers usually act or the weapons that they usually keep is not enough to establish exigency.\u201d <em>United States v. Granville </em>(9th Cir. 2000), 222 F.3d 1214, 1219. Evidence that firearms are within the residence or that a particular defendant is armed is not by itself sufficient to create an exigency. <em>[United States v. Becker </em>(9th Cir. 1994), 23 F.3d 1537, 1541]; <em>United States v. Marts </em>(8th Cir. 1993), 986 F.2d 1216, 1218. There must be specific information to lead the officers to a reasonable conclusion that the presence of firearms raises concerns for the officers\u2019 safety. <em>[United States v. Moore </em>(10th Cir. 1996), 91 F.3d 96, 98].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b412-10\"><em>Anyan, </em>\u00b6 44. Here, as the Court observes, any possibility of Cassady\u2019s demonstrating violence against the Officers did not rise to the level of relieving them of their constitutional duty to knock and announce their presence. \u00b6 36.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>\u00b661 I further agree with the Court that the Officers are entitled to qualified immunity on the knock-and-announce violation, though it is not clear from the Court\u2019s Opinion on what authority the Court is relying for our conclusion that the Officers\u2019 mistakes as to the legality of their actions were objectively \u201creasonable.\u201d <em>See Saucier v. Katz </em>(2001), 533 U.S. 194, 205, 121 S.Ct. 2151, 2158 (\u201cIf the officer\u2019s mistake as to what the law requires is <em>reasonable </em>... , the officer is entitled to the immunity defense.\u201d (emphasis added)). I also question whether it was \u201creasonable\u201d for the Officers to forego knocking and announcing their presence based on the belief that doing so was \u201cunnecessary,\u201d \u00b6 45, given that the exceptions to the knock-and-announce requirement are based on exigencies, not lack of necessity, \u00b6 31.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-3\">\u00b662 Lastly, with respect to Cassady\u2019s excessive force claim, I agree with the Court that the Officers\u2019 use of force following their entry into Cassady\u2019s home was not excessive and, therefore, did not constitute a constitutional violation. As the Court states, Sergeant Wallis observed a laser sight on Lieutenant Schieno\u2019s face immediately upon their entry into Cassady\u2019s home; Wallis knew that the laser likely originated from a gun aimed at Schieno; the Officers identified themselves as law enforcement and repeatedly ordered Cassady to drop his weapon; and Cassady did not comply. Given these circumstances, Wallis had probable cause to believe that Cassady posed a significant threat of death or serious physical harm to the officers-Schieno in particular. <em>Cf. Tennessee v. Garner </em>(1985), 471 U.S. 1, 11-12, 105 S.Ct. 1694, 1701 (\u201c[I]f the suspect threatens the officer with a weapon ..., deadly force may be used if necessary to prevent escape, and if, where feasible, some warning has been given.\u201d). Accordingly, Wallis\u2019s shooting at Cassady was objectively reasonable under the circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-4\">With these caveats, I concur in the decision of the Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
