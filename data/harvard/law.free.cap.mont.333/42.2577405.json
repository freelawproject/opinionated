The basic effect of the initiative is to amend Article VIII, Section 9 of the Montana Constitution to include an additional limit on appropriations by the Legislature to an amount that is determined by applying a formula based on the growth rate of the population and inflation unless the increase is approved by the electorate.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-7\">\u00b62 The material facts in this litigation are not disputed. Proponents\u2019 petition to place CI-97 on the ballot was approved by the Secretary of State, as required by Title 13, Chapter 27, Parts 2 and 3, MCA. It then was transmitted to the Attorney General as required by \u00a7 13-27-312, MCA. The Attorney General, after approving the petition as to form, sought and obtained the advice of parties on both sides of the issue as well as unsolicited comments from others. In addition, as CI-97 has a fiscal impact, it was submitted to the budget director for preparation of a fiscal note.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-8\">\u00b63 In compliance with \u00a7\u00a7 13-27-312(2)-(3), MCA, the Attorney General prepared separate statements explaining the purpose of the measure, the implications of a vote for and a vote against the measure, and a fiscal statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-9\">\u00b64 Proponents were dissatisfied with the statements prepared by the Attorney General. They timely filed a complaint in the District Court for the First Judicial District, Lewis &amp; Clark County, requesting the Court to alter all three of the Attorney General\u2019s statements; that is, the statement explaining the purpose of the measure, the statements of the implications of a vote for and a vote against the measure, and the fiscal statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-10\">\u00b65 The Attorney General was served with the complaint. He did not immediately answer. Proponents did not move the District Court to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>expedite the court action.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Proponents immediately proceeded to print petitions calling for the adoption of CI-97 and started collecting signatures. The petitions which registered voters have signed contain the statements prepared by the Attorney General.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-4\">\u00b66 After a hearing, the District Court promptly considered the questions presented and entered its Decision and Order on June 14, 2006. The District Court determined that the statement of the purpose of CI-97 drafted by the Attorney General was not true and accurate, the statements of implication drafted by the Attorney General were not true and, likewise, the fiscal statement drafted by the Attorney General was inaccurate and, consequently, untrue. The District Court rewrote all of the statements, and ordered that its amended statements be placed on the ballot concerning CI-97, should the measure become qualified for submission to the electorate.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-5\">\u00b67 The District Court also rejected the Attorney General\u2019s argument that \u00a7 13-27-312, MCA, requires that the statements on the petitions that are circulated and those on the ballot be the same. As a result, it declined to invalidate the signatures already gathered on petitions which do not contain the court\u2019s revised statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-6\">\u00b68 The Attorney General appealed the District Court order. This Court ordered expedited briefing, and has advanced this case on its calendar.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-7\">\u00b69 The order of the District Court is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-8\">\u00b610 Mixed questions of law and fact are presented to this Court when the historical facts of a case are admitted or established, the applicable law is undisputed, and the issue is whether the facts satisfy the statutory standard. <em>State v. Warclub, </em>2005 MT 149, \u00b6 21, 327 Mont. 352, \u00b6 21, 114 P.3d 254, \u00b6 21 (citing <em>Lambert v. Blodgett </em>(9th Cir. 2004), 393 F.3d 943, 965 <em>(citing Pullman-Standard v. Swint </em>(1982), 456 U.S. 273, 289 n. 19, 102 S.Ct. 1781, 1790, 72 L.Ed.2d 66, 80)). The statements prepared by the Attorney General are before the Court, and there is no dispute which statutes apply. The issues in this case present mixed questions of law and fact. This Court reviews mixed questions of law and fact <em>de novo. Duffy v. State, </em>2005 MT 228, \u00b6 10, 328 Mont. 369, \u00b6 10, 120 P.3d 398, \u00b6 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-9\">\u00b611 Section 13-27-312(4), MCA, contains the requirements for drafting statements of purpose and implication:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b71-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>The statement of purpose and the statements of implication must express the true and impartial explanation of the proposed ballot issue in plain, easily understood language and may not be arguments or written so as to create prejudice for or against the measure. Statements of implication must be written so that a positive vote indicates support for the measure and a negative vote indicates opposition to the measure.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b71-4\">\u00b612  The Attorney General has been designated by the Legislature as the public official who is to prepare the statements at issue. As long as the Attorney General\u2019s explanatory statement uses ordinary plain language, explains the general purpose of the issues submitted in language that is true and impartial, and not argumentative or likely to create prejudice either for or against the issue, the requirements of the law are met. <em>State ex rel. Wenzel v. Murray </em>(1978), 178 Mont. 441, 448, 585 P.2d 633, 637. If the proponents of a ballot measure believe that the statements prepared by the Attorney General do not satisfy the requirements of \u00a7 13-27-312, MCA, they may challenge the adequacy of the statements in the First Judicial District Court, Lewis &amp; Clark County. Section 13-27-316(1), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-5\">\u00b613 The statement of purpose prepared by the Attorney General reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b71-6\">The Montana Constitution currently prohibits appropriations by the legislature that exceed anticipated revenue. This measure adds a constitutional spending limit that would prohibit increases in appropriations greater than the combined growth rate of population and inflation. It allows appropriations up to the largest spending limit for any previous biennium. Emergencies, debt payments, pro-rata tax rebates, various appropriations expressly provided by the Montana Constitution, and expenditures from funding sources including the federal government, constitutionally created trusts, and certain user fees are not included in the spending limit. The legislature may exceed the spending limit only with voter approval.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b71-7\">\u00b614 The District Court did not determine that the Attorney General failed to use easily understood language in the statement of purpose or that it was written so as to create prejudice for or against the measure. The District Court determined that the Attorney General\u2019s statement is inaccurate in referring to the growth rate of population and inflation, rather than a change in those factors, as reflected in the text of the measure. It also determined the Attorney General\u2019s statement omitted salient provisions of the measure and, consequently, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>was not a true explanation of the measure. The District Court then rewrote the statement of purpose and certified its statement to the Secretary of State.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-4\">\u00b615  The District Court was incorrect when it determined that the Attorney General\u2019s statement of purpose is inaccurate in referring to the growth rate of population and inflation rather than a change in these factors. It is the purpose of the initiative to limit the ability of the Legislature to increase appropriations greater than an amount that is to be determined by considering any growth in Montana\u2019s population, and also considering inflation, a factor that takes into account any increase in the costs of goods and services. The measure does not provide that the legislature must decrease appropriations in the event Montana\u2019s population decreases or deflation occurs. Thus, the statement of purpose drafted by the Attorney General is not inaccurate.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-5\">\u00b616 The District Court also determined that the Attorney General\u2019s statement of purpose omits \u201csalient provisions\u201d of the measure and, therefore, is not a true explanation of it. The District Court\u2019s rewritten statement, similar to that drafted by the Attorney General, refers to items that are not included in the limit. What the District Court added to the statement of purpose were statements that any Montana resident or business could sue to enforce the new measure, could recover costs and fees if the suit is successful, and that the new limit would apply to the next Legislature. In order to add these statements and remain within the statutorily-mandated 100-word limit, the District Court changed the first sentence of the Attorney General\u2019s statement and shortened the statement of items exempted from calculating the limit that is imposed on new appropriations.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-6\">\u00b617  We decline to hold, in this instance, that the statement of the Attorney General is untrue and biased because it does not say a lawsuit may be brought to enforce it, and that it will, if adopted, be binding on the next Legislature. Section 13-27-312(2)(a), MCA, requires the Attorney General, after seeking comments, to prepare a statement of the purpose of the measure containing not more than 100 words. Necessarily, a complete description of every part of the measure cannot be included. There are numerous portions of the initiative, which is lengthy and complicated, that could be deemed salient to voters. They cannot all be truthfully described in 100 words. The statement of purpose prepared by the Attorney General does state the purpose of CI-97; that is, what it will do. The Attorney General\u2019s statement of purpose then briefly describes some elements of how the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>measure\u2019s purpose will be accomplished, if it is adopted, and closes by stating that the limit on appropriations can be exceeded if approved by the electorate. It is not for a court to add to the requirements of \u00a7 13-27-312, MCA, that to be adequate, a statement of the purpose of an initiative must include a description of how it can be enforced, or a statement of when it will become effective. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1-2-101, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-4\">\u00b618  By our ruling here, we do not determine that the corrections and additions ordered by the District Court are patently wrong, or even that this Court would not prefer the District Court\u2019s rendition of the statement over that of the Attorney General. Nor do we conclude that the Court or individual Justices could not do a better job of drafting a statement of purpose.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> What we do hold is that the statement of purpose prepared by the Attorney General adequately meets the statutory obligation to provide a true and impartial explanation of the proposed ballot issue in plain, easily understood language that is not drafted so as to create prejudice for or against the measure. To foreclose the prospect of endless and subjective challenges, as long as the statement of purpose prepared by the Attorney General meets all the requirements of \u00a7 13-27-312(4), MCA, we will defer to his decision. Because the statement of purpose prepared by the Attorney General is adequate to meet the requirements of the law, we decline to engage in an unnecessary comparison of such statements with those written by the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-5\">\u00b619 The statements of implication prepared by the Attorney General are:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b73-6\">FOR limiting the increase in appropriations to the combined growth rate of population and inflation, or the largest spending limit for any previous biennium.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b73-7\">AGAINST limiting the increase in appropriations to the combined growth rate of population and inflation, or the largest spending limit for any previous biennium.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b73-8\">\u00b620 Similar to its determination regarding the statement of purpose, the District Court determined that the Attorney General\u2019s statements of implication were not a true and impartial explanation of the measure because of the inaccurate references to \u201cgrowth rate\u201d rather than the \u201cchange\u201d in population and inflation. It rewrote those <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>statements, again substituting \u201cchange\u201d for \u201cgrowth,\u201d and added to the statements that the voters can approve a higher spending limit. In order to do this and remain within the fifty word limit imposed by \u00a7 13-27-312(2)(b), MCA,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the District Court deleted from the statements that appropriations could remain at the largest spending limit for any previous biennium.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-4\">\u00b621 For the same reasons stated in our consideration of the Attorney General\u2019s statement of purpose above at \u00b6 15, we conclude that the use of the term growth, rather than change, does not render the statements of implication prepared by the Attorney General untruthful or biased.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-5\">\u00b622  CI-97 provides that appropriations may remain at the largest spending limit for any previous biennium, and that the voters can approve a higher spending limit. The District Court seems to agree with the Attorney General that the information that a cap on appropriations based on the factors of population and inflation is fairly included in the statements of implication. The District Court did not give an explanation of why it determined that the ability of voters to approve a higher spending limit is of greater importance than that the measure allows appropriations to remain at the same level even if Montana\u2019s population decreases or deflation occurs. Both are important parts of the measure. However, this Court can discern no reason why one of these provisions of CI-97 is of greater import than the other. Both are clearly set forth in the statement of purpose, and thus both will be before the voters when they cast their ballots. We conclude that the statements of implication prepared by the Attorney General satisfy the statutory requirements of \u00a7 13-27-312(4), MCA, and, consequently, that the District Court erred in rewriting them.</p>\n<p id=\"AX\">\u00b623 The fiscal statement prepared by the Attorney General reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AZ\">This measure may require reduced future expenditures in several areas of government services where caseloads historically have grown at a rate exceeding combined growth in population and inflation, such as correctional population and Medicaid recipients, or may require reduced future expenditures in other areas to offset those increasing caseload costs.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b74-6\">\u00b624  Contrary to the argument of the Attorney General, we conclude that \u00a7 13-27-316, MCA, provides for court review of the fiscal statement attached to a proposed ballot measure where the proponents <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>of the measure believe the statement does not satisfy the requirements of \u00a7 13-27-312, MCA. In <em>State v. Waltermire </em>(1986), 224 Mont. 230, 232, 730 P.2d 375, 376, this Court held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b75-4\">The legislative history of \u00a7 13-27-316, MCA, indicates that the legislature intended a clear and speedy means by which both proponents and opponents could attack the sufficiency of statements of purpose and implication and fiscal notes. The statutory procedure allows district court and Supreme Court review for correction of any deficiencies so that the initiative might still be presented to the voters at the general election.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b75-5\">\u00b625  Because CI-97 has an effect on state expenditures, \u00a7 13-27-312(1), MCA, requires the Attorney General to order a fiscal note incorporating such effect, the substance of which must substantially comply with the provisions of \u00a7 5-4-205, MCA. Section 5-4-205, MCA, provides for the contents of fiscal notes presented to the Legislature dining its consideration of introduced bills having a fiscal impact. It reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b75-6\">Fiscal notes shall, where possible, show in dollar amounts the estimated increase or decrease in revenues or expenditures, costs which may be absorbed without additional funds, and long-range financial implications. No comment or opinion relative to merits of the bill shall be included; however, technical or mechanical defects may be noted.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b75-7\">Section 5-4-205, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-8\">\u00b626 The fiscal note requested by the Attorney General was prepared by the Governor\u2019s Office of Budget and Program Planning. It consists of a three-page letter, containing some history of population growth and inflation in Montana, and noting that over the long term it is likely that the level of services offered by state government will be reduced as policymakers choose to reduce services rather than put additional measures on the ballot. The fiscal note says that the fiscal impact of the measure is unknown. As required by \u00a7 13-27-312(3), MCA, the Attorney General prepared the above fiscal statement of no more than fifty words.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-9\">\u00b627 The District Court determined that the fiscal statement prepared by the Attorney General contained the same inaccuracy as the previous statements because it referred to growth rate, rather than change. Again, this Court disagrees with the District Court, for the same reasons stated in \u00b6 15. Then, without stating why, the District Court also determined that the fiscal statement was confusing and misleading upon a cursory reading, and rewrote it.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>\u00b628 Proponents argue that the Attorney General\u2019s fiscal statement is insufficient because it does not contain estimated dollar amounts of any anticipated increase or decrease in revenues or expenditures.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-4\">\u00b629  Upon review, the Court concludes that the fiscal statement prepared by the Attorney General is satisfactory, if not perfect, and satisfies the requirements of both \u00a7\u00a7 13-27-312, and 5-4-205, MCA. Section 5-4-205, MCA, only requires that a fiscal note show dollar amounts when such is possible. The Office of Budget and Program Planning did not deem it possible to show its conclusions in dollar amounts. The record does not contradict such determination. Some possible long-range financial implications are mentioned in the Attorney General\u2019s fiscal statement but it does not appear from the record that such are untrue. The fiscal statement does not contain a comment or an opinion concerning CI-97, and it does not note any technical or mechanical defects in the measure. Also, upon review, the Court concludes that the Attorney General\u2019s fiscal statement is not confusing or misleading.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-5\">\u00b630 The Attorney General, as an alternative prayer, asks this Court to reverse the District Court\u2019s determination that signatures on petitions, which do not contain the same statements as those appearing on the ballot, are nevertheless valid. However, as we determine that the statements prepared by the Attorney General are sufficient, we need not reach this question.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-6\">\u00b631  This Court concludes that the statements of the Attorney General are sufficient to meet the applicable statutory requirements. The June 14, 2006, Decision and Order of the District Court is reversed. Proponents shall have no relief by their complaint. CI-97 having qualified to be placed on the ballot<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> for the November 7, 2006, general election, shall be submitted to the electorate containing the statement of purpose, the statements of implication, and the fiscal statement as prepared by the Attorney General.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-7\">\u00b632 Remittitur shall issue forthwith.</p>\n<judges id=\"b76-8\">JUSTICES COTTER, LEAPHART, RICE and MORRIS concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b70-10\"> Section 13-27-316(3)(a), MCA, provides that the district court \u201cshall examine the proposed measure and the challenged statement... and shall as soon as possible render a decision^]\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b73-9\"> Amicus Curiae argue that this Court should again alter the statement which was rewritten by the District Court, so as to provide what they deem to be an even better statement of purpose.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b74-7\"> Each statement of implication must contain no more than twenty-five words.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b76-13\"><em> </em>The Court is advised that the Secretary of State has certified that CI-97 has qualified to be placed on the ballot.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b76-9\">JUSTICE NELSON</author>\n<p id=\"Aj\">dissents.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-10\">\u00b633 I am not able to join the Court\u2019s Opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-11\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-12\">\u00b634 <em>Should the District Court\u2019s determination to revise the Attorney </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number><em>General\u2019s statements be reversed?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b77-4\">\u00b635 Before getting to the merits of the Court\u2019s decision, I note that the Court appears to fault the Attorney General for not \u201cimmediately\u201d answering the Proponents\u2019 complaint. <em>See </em>\u00b6 5. There is nothing in the law that requires the Attorney General to answer the Proponents\u2019 complaint \u201cimmediately.\u201d The record discloses that the Attorney General answered the Proponents complaint in a timely manner. Rule 12(a), M.R.Civ.P. Under this same rule, the Proponents could have moved to shorten the time for filing the Attorney General\u2019s answer, but they did not do so. Indeed, the District Court, <em>sua sponte, </em>could have shortened the time for filing the State\u2019s answer and, thus, further expedited the hearing and ruling on the Proponents\u2019 challenge. <em>See </em>\u00a7 13-27-316(3)(a), MCA (mandating that \u201c[t]he action [challenging the attorney general\u2019s statement of purpose, implication of vote and fiscal statement] takes precedence over other cases and matters in the district court\u201d). Yet, this matter proceeded through the court at the pace it did without any apparent objection from the Proponents. While the times for accomplishing court challenges under \u00a7 13-27-316, MCA, are extremely tight, given other provisions of Title 13, Chapters 2 and 3,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the finger of fault for any claimed delay should not be pointed at the Attorney General.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-5\">\u00b636 Turning now to this Court\u2019s Opinion, the rationale and result of this Opinion is to disagree with the statements of purpose, the statements of implication, and the fiscal statement (hereinafter collectively referred to, where appropriate, as \u201cthe statements\u201d) as redrafted by the District Court, and to agree with and to reinstate the statements drafted by the Attorney General. Aside from my disagreement with the Court\u2019s decision in this regard, I note that in \u00b6\u00b6 1 and 15 of this Court\u2019s Opinion we provide our own statements of purpose and effect of Cl 97. Since our decision here becomes the law <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>of this case,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> one is left to wonder whether this Court has, as a matter of law, now altered the statement of purpose of the Attorney General. If this Court is approving a statement of the Attorney General over that of the District Court, we ought not to insert yet a third statement, our own, into this mix-especially where this Court\u2019s statement likely trumps the other two.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-4\">\u00b637 Turning next to the statutes at issue here, \u00a7\u00a7 13-27-310 through -316, MCA, may be summarized in the following fashion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b78-5\">(a) The Attorney General is charged with the responsibility for drafting the statements which are to be placed on the circulation petition and on the official ballot. Sections 13-27-312 and - 316(3)(b), MCA.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b78-6\">(b) If either the proponents or opponents of the petition disagree with the Attorney General\u2019s statements, they may file a challenge in the Lewis and Clark County District Court requesting that the court \u201calter the statement or modify the attorney general\u2019s determination.\u201d Section 13-27-316(1), MCA.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b78-7\">(c) The statement certified by the court must be placed on the petition which will be circulated and on the official ballot. Section 13-27-316(3)(b), MCA.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b78-8\">\u00b638 With this statutory scheme in mind, we state in \u00b6 10 that \u201cmixed questions of law and fact\u201d are presented to this Court. I am not clear from the Court\u2019s Opinion what \u201cfacts\u201d are at issue here or are even relevant. While the District Court held a hearing before making its decision,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> it appears from the Clerk of Court\u2019s docket entries that the hearing was not held to receive factual evidence, but rather, was held simply to receive oral argument on the parties\u2019 respective legal positions and on the trial court\u2019s statutory authority to review and alter the Attorney General\u2019s statement. The record does not disclose any \u201cfact-finding\u201d by the trial judge. And, not surprisingly, this Court\u2019s Opinion does not refer to any material \u201cfacts\u201d which are implicated in its decision. The language of the statements of the Attorney General and that of the District Court are undisputed. They are what they are.</p>\n<p id=\"A61\">\u00b639 In this regard, the Court\u2019s error in articulating and applying the mixed law and fact standard of review is two-fold.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>\u00b640 First, as noted above, no \u201cfacts\u201d are being reviewed as the trial court did not find any facts. The District Court\u2019s decision was purely a legal assessment of the Attorney General\u2019s statements, which language is not in dispute. As is with the review of any legal error, the proper standard is <em>de novo </em>or plenary. <em>In re Marriage of Robison, </em>2002 MT 207, \u00b6 15, 311 Mont. 246, \u00b6 15, 53 P.3d 1279, \u00b6 15. The District Court\u2019s task was simply to determine whether the Attorney General\u2019s statements met the statutory requirements of \u00a7 13-27-312, MCA. The trial judge has no discretion to simply insert her language in place of the Attorney General\u2019s because she thinks it might read better or make more sense. Under \u00a7 13-27-316(3)(a), MCA, the courtis to \u201cexamine the proposed measure and the challenged statement or determination of the attorney general and... certify to the secretary of state a statement which the court determines will meet the requirements of 13-27-312 or an opinion as to the correctness of the attorney general\u2019s determination.\u201d This determination must, of necessity, be made by examination of the language of the measure itself and the information provided by the budget director pursuant to \u00a7 13-27-312(1), MCA. It is a legal determination, not a factual one.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-4\">\u00b641 Second, it is the District Court\u2019s legal conclusions about <em>why </em>the Attorney General\u2019s statements do not pass statutory muster that is critical to its decision and to our review. If the District Court\u2019s legal conclusions in this regard are correct, then the language that the trial court substituted for that language used by the Attorney General must be reviewed to insure that the court\u2019s language is legally correct. Both of these inquiries are legal determinations, not factual ones.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-5\">\u00b642 Section 13-27-312, MCA, offers scant guidance to an attorney general attempting to comply with its provisions. With the advice of the parties, \u00a7 13-27-312(2), MCA,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> requires a statement explaining the purpose of the measure and statements explaining the implications of a vote for or against the measure, and \u00a7 13-27-312(3), MCA, requires a fiscal statement prepared from information furnished by the budget director under \u00a7 13-27-312(1), MCA. Section 13-27-312(4), MCA, imposes the obligation on the attorney general that the statements be <em>truthful and impartial, </em>easily understood, not argumentative, and not prejudicial for or against the measure.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-6\">\u00b643 At this point, it is useful to compare the two statements of purpose at issue. The Attorney General\u2019s statement of purpose reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b80-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>The Montana Constitution currently prohibits appropriations by the legislature that exceed anticipated revenue. This measure adds a constitutional spending limit that would prohibit increases in appropriations greater than the combined growth rate of population and inflation. It allows appropriations up to the largest spending limit for any previous biennium. Emergencies, debt payments, pro-rata tax rebates, various appropriations expressly provided by the Montana Constitution, and expenditures from funding sources including the federal government, constitutionally created trusts, and certain user fees are not included in the spending limit. The legislature may exceed the spending limit only with voter approval.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b80-4\">Conversely, the District Court\u2019s reiteration of the Attorney General\u2019s statement of purpose states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b80-5\">This measure restricts increases in state government spending by adding a spending limit to the Montana Constitution. Total increases in appropriations by the legislature would be limited to the combined change in population and inflation, unless the spending limit for any previous biennium would be higher. The legislature could not exceed this limit without voter approval. Exceptions include, generally, federal monies, constitutionally created trusts, emergencies, debt payments, highway revenues, and some user fees. Any Montana resident or business could sue to enforce the measure and, if successful, receive costs and attorney fees. The measure would apply to the next legislature.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AaA\">\u00b644 At \u00b6 14 of this Court\u2019s Opinion, we fault the District Court for concluding that the Attorney General\u2019s statement of purpose was untrue. That, of course, is one of the determinations under the statute, the District Court Judge was obligated to make. So <em>why </em>is the trial court\u2019s conclusion incorrect as a matter of law? Our answer, found at \u00b6\u00b6 15 and 16, is in this Court\u2019s substituted determination of the purpose of the initiative and the appropriate language that should be included in the statement-which as noted before, is different than either the Attorney General\u2019s or the District Court\u2019s. The mere fact that this Court disagrees with the legal conclusions of the District Court does not explain <em>why </em>the latter court\u2019s conclusions are wrong as a matter of law. There is a complete lack of analysis in the Court\u2019s Opinion on this point.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-6\">\u00b645 The District Court grounded its decision in its comparison of the actual text of the measure with the Attorney General\u2019s use of \u201cgrowth rate\u201d of population and inflation not found in the text. For that reason, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>the District Court substituted the word \u201cchange\u201d which is actually found in the text of the measure. Moreover, pursuing that same approach, the District Court Judge observed that the Attorney General omitted salient provisions of the measure needed to make the statement of purpose true-as \u00a7 13-27-312(4), MCA, plainly requires. In the context of the statutory scheme, a \u201ctrue\u201d statement is not one that is simply not false. A partial statement, while containing no false information itself, may not be \u201ctrue\u201d without the inclusion of other information that accurately represents the language of the measure. While \u201ctruth\u201d may be a somewhat subject concept, we, at least, owe the parties and the trial court some definition of what constitutes a true statement under the statutory scheme.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-4\">\u00b646 However, as noted, this Court\u2019s Opinion offers no legal analysis or rationale explaining <em>why </em>the District Court\u2019s conclusions and language are legally incorrect. This Court simply spins its decision with its own reiteration of what it thinks is the initiative\u2019s purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-5\">\u00b647 Indeed, this Court concedes at \u00b6 18 that the District Court\u2019s conclusions are not \u201cpatently wrong\u201d and suggests that the trial judge\u2019s statement might even be \u201cpreferable\u201d to the Attorney General\u2019s statement.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> That begs the obvious question, if the District Court Judge is not \u201cpatently wrong\u201d and if her statement of purpose might even be \u201cpreferable\u201d to the Attorney General\u2019s, then why are we reversing the trial court? How wrong, exactly, or right does she have to be? The statutory scheme requires the statements to be \u201ctrue,\u201d \u201ceasily understood,\u201d not argumentative, and not prejudicial. Section 13-27-312(4), MCA. <em>Why </em>the District Court\u2019s statements failed to meet these statutory criteria and <em>why </em>the Attorney General\u2019s do, is not explained in the Court\u2019s Opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-6\">\u00b648 However, the reason for this lapse is likely in this Court\u2019s preference for its own reiteration of the statement of purpose-see \u00b6\u00b6 1 and 15-and its preference for this statement of purpose as being more in line with the Attorney General\u2019s. Indeed, the Court\u2019s insertion of its own view into this matter, at the expense of its review of the District Court\u2019s decision for actual legal error, is manifest in the Court\u2019s further holding that the Attorney General\u2019s statement of purpose is also in \u201cplain, easily understood language that is not drafted so as to create prejudice for or against the measure,\u201d <em>see </em>\u00b6 18-grounds <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>that were not even addressed by the District Court, <em>see </em>\u00b6 14. The trial court ruled only that the Attorney General\u2019s statements were not true.</p>\n<p id=\"A83h\">\u00b649 Our enthusiasm for reversing the District Court and reinstating the Attorney General\u2019s language in the statement of purpose has, unfortunately, led to this Court substituting its judgment for that of the trial court. What is lacking in this Court\u2019s Opinion is any analysis and discussion of the actual language of the measure and how that language is best summarized so as to fulfill the statutory requirements of \u00a7 13-27-312(4), MCA-i.e., so that, within the context of the measure, the statement of purpose is \u201ctrue,\u201d \u201cimpartial,\u201d written in \u201cplain, easily understood language,\u201d and not argumentative or so as to \u201ccreate prejudice for or against the measure.\u201d We owe it to the Attorney General and the District Court Judge to perform this analysis, and our failure to do so leaves the Court\u2019s decision as little more than the majority\u2019s gut reaction that the Attorney General\u2019s language is good enough for government purposes. That really is no decision at all; we establish no legal precedent as to how these sorts of disputes should be resolved in future challenges, leaving, instead, each to be decided on the sort of shoot from the hip approach used here.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-4\">\u00b650 As to this Court\u2019s discussion of the statements of implication of vote and the fiscal statement, but without going into the detail of those, I, likewise, reach the same conclusions as to this Court\u2019s failure to properly analyze the trial court\u2019s language vis-a-vis the Attorney General\u2019s language given the requirements of \u00a7 13-27-312(4), MCA, the information provided by the budget director, and the language of the measure. Without more, I conclude that the District Court properly exercised its statutory authority and obligation under \u00a7 13-27-312(4), MCA, to render the statements truthful-again, grounded in its conclusion that the Attorney General\u2019s statements did not track the textual language or the effect of the measure itself. Indeed, I agree with the District Court that the Attorney General\u2019s fiscal statement, <em>see </em>\u00b6 23, would be misleading and confusing to the ordinary lay petition-signer and voter. Again, as with its holding in \u00b6 18, the Court concludes that the Attorney General\u2019s statement is good enough-it is \u201csatisfactory, if not perfect,\u201d <em>see </em>\u00b6 29-and thus suffices to pass statutory muster. <em>Why </em>the trial court\u2019s determination to rewrite the fiscal statement based on the text of the measure is legally incorrect is not explained in the Court\u2019s Opinion, however.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-5\">\u00b651 Summarizing my dissent with respect to this Court\u2019s reversal of the District Court\u2019s determination to rewrite the Attorney General\u2019s statement, this Court\u2019s Opinion at once concedes that the trial judge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>was not \u201cpatently wrong\u201d; that her reiteration of the statements might even be preferable; that the Attorney General\u2019s statements were only satisfactory and adequate, though not perfect; and that the Attorney General\u2019s statements are correct (because this Court\u2019s own restatement of the purpose, implication and fiscal implications of the measure are closer to those of the Attorney General\u2019s). There is no explanation of <em>why </em>the District Court\u2019s determinations-grounded in the actual text of the measure itself and information provided by the budget director-are incorrect, as a matter of law. We have failed in our obligation to conduct a <em>de novo </em>review of the trial court\u2019s legal conclusions. Rather, we have simply substituted our judgment-and our re-iteration of the statements-for those of the trial judge. We give no legal guidance to the district courts or to the Attorney General, and we establish no parameters for future similar challenges.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-4\">\u00b652 Accordingly, I dissent from the Court\u2019s decision. I would affirm the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-6\">\u00b653 <em>Should signatures collected on illegal circulation petitions he declared invalid?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b83-7\">\u00b654 Since I would affirm the District Court on the first issue, that leads me to the place where I must part company with the District Court on the second issue. The Attorney General argues that if his statements are held not to satisfy \u00a7 13-27-312, MCA,-i.e., if the District Court is affirmed-then the signatures collected by the Proponents on petitions using the Attorney General\u2019s statements may not be counted in qualifying the constitutional initiative to appear on the ballot. Primarily, the Attorney General relies on \u00a7 13-27-316(3)(b), MCA, contending that the statutory scheme requires that Proponents\u2019 ballot statement disputes be resolved before signature gathering so that no signatures are obtained by means of an illegal petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-8\">\u00b655 The trial judge ruled that the statements on the petition and the statements on the official ballot could be different because the \u201cstatements contained on the circulating petitions are [not] so inaccurate or misleading as to warrant invalidating signatures already gathered.\u201d The District Court relied on <em>State ex. rel. Boese v. Waltermire </em>(1986), 224 Mont. 230, 730 P.2d 375. However, as the Attorney General points out, that decision is inapposite because there the proponents\u2019 challenge to the Attorney General\u2019s ballot statements was resolved before the petition was circulated to the voters. The statements on the petition for circulation and on the official ballot <em>were </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>the same. <em>Boese, </em>224 Mont. at 231, 730 P.2d at 376.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-4\">\u00b656 Moreover, the District Court Judge reasoned here that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b84-5\">the accuracy of the statements is more critical to the voter in the voting booth than to voters signing the petition. The ballot does not contain the actual text of the initiative, so these statements are the only information presented to voters at the time of choosing how to vote on the measure. Signers of the petition, however, have available to them the full text of the initiative and, in addition are deciding whether to place the measure on the ballot, not whether they actually wish to enact it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b84-6\">\u00b657 The Proponents advance a similar line of reasoning as the District Court\u2019s, quoting the foregoing paragraph. Additionally, the Proponents state that \u201c[s]igners of the petition also have the benefit of being able to ask questions about the measure from the people gathering the signatures.\u201d Finally, Proponents argue that invalidating the signatures violates their constitutional right to seek full legal redress from the courts. As to this last argument, Proponents reason that if they cannot collect signatures until the District Court and the Supreme Court finally rule on their challenges, they are not provided sufficient time and opportunity to obtain enough signatures under the rewritten statement of purpose, thereby preventing them from placing the measure on the November ballot. This situation, according to Proponents, forces citizens to choose between pursuing their right under \u00a7 13-27-316(1), MCA, to petition the district court for redress, or to not seek redress so that signatures can be collected without being invalidated. Proponents also argue that there is no statutory provision that requires them to obtain a final decision from the District Court and from this Court before beginning to gather signatures.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-7\">\u00b658 Neither the District Court nor the Proponents are correct. The trial court\u2019s conclusion that the \u201cstatements contained on the circulating petitions are [not] so inaccurate or misleading as to warrant invalidating signatures already gathered\u201d begs the fundamental question. If, in fact, the trial judge\u2019s reasoning is correct, then why did the court invalidate the statements of the Attorney General in the first place? The statements cannot on the one hand be so untruthful, inaccurate and misleading as to prevent them from being on the ballot, yet, at the same time, be not so untruthful, not so inaccurate and not so misleading so as to prevent them from appearing on the petition for circulation. Either the statements are true, accurate and not misleading or they are not. If, indeed, there is no material or substantive difference in the language substituted by the court for that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>of the Attorney General\u2019s, then this entire litigation and appeal simply exalts form over substance in violation of \u00a7 1-3-219, MCA; it is nothing more than an exercise in elevating the sublime over the ridiculous.</p>\n<p id=\"AlR\">\u00b659 The statutory scheme enacted by the Legislature clearly and unambiguously requires: (a) that the statements be \u201ctrue,\u201d \u201cimpartial,\u201d written in \u201cplain, easily understood language,\u201d and not argumentative or so as to \u201ccreate prejudice for or against the measure,\u201d \u00a7 13-27-312(4), MCA, and (b) that the statements certified by the court-here, this Court\u2019s own statement or the Attorney General\u2019s (I am unsure)-\u201crausi <em>be placed on the petition for circulation and on the official ballot.\u201d </em>Section 13-27-316(3)(b), MCA (emphasis added). There is nothing in the statutory scheme that allows the statements on the petition for circulation and on the official ballot to be different. Indeed, \u00a7 13-27-316(3)(b), MCA, clearly and unambiguously requires precisely the opposite.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-4\">\u00b660 The District Court\u2019s and Proponents\u2019 reasoning that the accuracy of the statements is more critical to the voter in the voting booth than to voters signing the petition is fallacious. As noted, the trial court and Proponents observe that because the ballot does not contain the actual text of the initiative, the statements are the only information presented to the voters at the time of choosing how to vote on the measure. According to the District Court and the Proponents, signers of the petition, on the other hand, have available to them the full text of the initiative and, in addition, are deciding whether to place the measure on the ballot, not whether they actually wish to enact it.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-5\">\u00b661 As noted above, the flaw in this line of reasoning is that it ignores the plain and unambiguous requirement of the statutory scheme that the statements on the circulation petition be \u201ctrue,\u201d \u201cimpartial,\u201d written in \u201cplain, easily understood language,\u201d and not argumentative or so as to \u201ccreate prejudice for or against the measure\u201d and that the statements be the same on both the petition for circulation and on the official ballot. Sections 13-27-312(4) and -316(3)(b), MCA. The trial court\u2019s and Proponents\u2019 rationale is that untruthful, partial, argumentative, not easily understood, and prejudicial statements can be on either the circulation petition or the ballot; it does not matter. That is not what the black-letter law allows, however.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-6\">\u00b662 It is also black-letter law-so often cited that the cases are legion-that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b85-7\">[i]n the construction of a statute, the office of the judge is simply to ascertain and declare what is in terms or in substance contained therein, not to insert what has been omitted or to omit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>what has been inserted.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b86-4\">Section 1-2-101, MCA. It is this Court\u2019s and every court\u2019s \u201cduty ... to construe the law as it is written.\u201d <em>In re Estate of Magelssen </em>(1979), 182 Mont. 372, 378, 597 P.2d 90, 94 (citing \u00a7 1-2-101, MCA). Moreover, \u201c[i]n the construction of a statute, the intention of the legislature is to be pursued if possible.\u201d Section 1-2-102, MCA. In ascertaining the Legislature\u2019s intent, \u201cit is beyond dispute that... we are bound by [the] plain and unambiguous language used in a statute and may not consider legislative history or any other means of statutory construction,\u201d <em>McKirdy v. Vielleux, </em>2000 MT 264, \u00b6 22, 302 Mont. 18, \u00b6 22, 19 P.3d 207, \u00b6 22 (citing <em>MacMillan v. State Compensation Ins. Fund </em>(1997), 285 Mont. 202, 208, 947 P.2d 75, 78), absent there being an ambiguity in the statute. \u201cIf no ambiguity exists in a statute, the letter of the law will not be disregarded under the pretext of pursuing its spirit.\u201d <em>Magelssen, </em>182 Mont. at 378, 597 P.2d at 94 (citing <em>Vaughn &amp; Ragsdale v. State Board of Equalization </em>(1939), 109 Mont. 52, 60, 96 P.2d 420, 424).</p>\n<p id=\"b86-5\">\u00b663 On the one hand, Proponents demand that the courts follow the law when it is to their benefit, but they demand that the courts ignore the law when it is not to their advantage. Such an argument is disingenuous; Proponents cannot have it both ways. Indeed, in ignoring the fundamental rules of statutory construction, the Proponents urge a judicially-activist, result-oriented approach upon the courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-6\">\u00b664 Similarly, Proponents\u2019 argument that \u201c[s]igners of the petition also have the benefit of being able to ask questions about the measure from the people gathering the signatures\u201d is even more untenable. In the first place, nothing in the statutory scheme even remotely suggests that petition signers are to obtain information about the measure from the signature gatherers. The statutes enacted by the Legislature require that petition signers and voters alike, be informed about the measure from the approved and identical statements on, respectively, the petition for circulation and the official ballot. Sections 13-27-312 and -316(3)(b), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-7\">\u00b665 In the second place, the implicit argument that signature gatherers are competent to truthfully and impartially explain to potential petition signers the purpose, fiscal impact, and vote implications of a complex, proposed constitutional amendment such as the one at issue here (it covers three pages, single spaced, and is written in legalese) is patently ludicrous. Signature gatherers typically are not attorneys. Many are volunteer lay persons and some are hired, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>often from out of state, to obtain signatures for pay. Collective common experience is that most professional signature gatherers do not have a clue about what they are asking people to sign. The simplistic explanations of a measure given by such persons, in a legal sense, are typically neither true nor impartial, but rather, are prejudicial and misleading-all contrary to the legislative scheme discussed above. Signature gatherers, by definition, volunteer or are hired and paid to promote the petition, argue for it and encourage people to sign it. <em>A fortiori, </em>signature gatherers\u2019 statements are prejudiced in favor of the measure-contrary to what \u00a7 13-27-312(4), MCA, specifically requires.</p>\n<p id=\"Azx\">\u00b666 Indeed, when such persons give legal interpretations of the purpose, voting implications and fiscal effects of a measure, it is likely that they are engaged in the unauthorized practice of law in even giving such advice. <em>See </em>\u00a7 37-61-201, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-4\">\u00b667 Common experience is also that neither typical petition signers nor voters have read, much less understand, the entirety of a proposed constitutional amendment as lengthy and as complex as the one at issue here. It is precisely for this reason that the peoples\u2019 representatives in the Legislature enacted a statutory scheme requiring identical statements on both the petition for circulation and official ballot that me \u201ctrue,\u201d \u201cimpartial,\u201d written in \u201cplain, easily understood language\u201d and not argumentative or so as to \u201ccreate prejudice for or against the measure.\u201d Sections 13-27-312(4) and - 316(3)(b), MCA. Proponents\u2019 arguments to the contrary, this legislative scheme does not envision that petition signers will be fairly or intelligently informed about the measure from the very people who, voluntarily or for pay, are promoting the measure. The Legislature determined that both petition signers and voters be informed about the measure from the same source-the identical, approved statements authorized by \u00a7\u00a7 13-27-312 and -316(3)(b), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-5\">\u00b668 Again, Proponents\u2019 argument urges the courts to ignore the plain language of the statutes and to adopt an activist, result-oriented approach that works to their advantage.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-6\">\u00b669 The statutes at issue may not be simply ignored because the District Court believes the statements it rejected are \u201ctrue enough\u201d for the petition but \u201cnot true enough\u201d for the ballot. The legislative scheme does not permit this result, but rather, requires precisely that the statements on the petition for circulation and on the official ballot be the same. Section 13-27-316(3)(b), MCA. Nor may Proponents demand that the courts ignore the law because, having won their challenge in the District Court, they must now live with the adverse consequences <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>that flow from their victory. The law cannot be applied in such a Pharisaical manner.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-4\">\u00b670 Finally, Proponents\u2019 argument that enforcing the law deprives them of their right of access to the courts is equally without merit. In point of fact, Proponents have had full access to the courts in this case. If the legislative scheme requires time frames that are difficult to negotiate and which are unrealistic (and as I have noted above, that may be the case) then Proponents\u2019 remedy is to challenge the constitutionality of the statutory scheme or to seek legislative amendment of the offending statutes. Proponents may not seek to have the District Court or this Court simply legislate from the bench and ignore statutes not to the Proponents benefit or liking. As stated above, this approach simply urges courts to be activist and result-oriented.</p>\n<p id=\"A4\">\u00b671 On this issue, I would reverse the District Court, and I would invalidate petitions which contain the untrue, misleading and inaccurate language that the District Court revised.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-5\">\u00b672 On the basis of the foregoing, I dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b77-6\"> With due respect, the Legislature should comprehensively review the statutory time frames for the whole initiative process. These time frames are unrealistic given the time it takes to formulate and obtain review of the proposed language for the petition, file and conclude court challenges and appeal, if any, and then circulate a petition with the approved statements so that both the statements on the petition and the ballot willbe the same. <em>See </em>\u00a7 13-27-316(b), MCA. Moreover, the statutorily-imposed word limitations in \u00a7 13-27-312(2), MCA, for the various statements-100 words for the statement of purpose; 25 words each for the statements of implication; and 50 words for the fiscal statement-are equally unrealistic given the complexity of citizen initiatives-CI 97 being only one recent example. If the statements on the petition and ballot are truly intended to inform petition signers and voters in making an intelligent choice, then such statements must be sufficiently complete and understandable to accomplish that goal. The arbitrarily short word limitations imposed in the statutes frustrate that goal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b78-9\"> See <em>Moody v. Northland Royalty, Co. (1997), 286 </em>Mont. 89, 92-93, 951 P.2d 18, 21-22 (whether right or wrong, the Supreme Court\u2019s decision is the law of the case, is a final determination, will not be reopened, and is binding upon the parties).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b78-10\"> No transcript of that hearing has been presented to this Court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b79-7\"> I do not reiterate here the matter of the word limitations set forth in these statutes, which, as noted above, I suggest are wholly unrealistic.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b81-7\"> Ironically, the Court then goes on to suggest that this Court or individual Justices might even do a better job of drafting.

I join the portions of Justice Nelson\u2019s dissent that relate directly to the legal merits on that issue, and would affirm the District Court. Consequently, like Justice Nelson, I must address the District Court\u2019s determination that the signatures gathered on petitions containing the Attorney General\u2019s flawed statements are not invalid. Unlike Justice Nelson, I would affirm the District Court on that issue as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-8\">\u00b674 Section 13-27-316(3)(b), MCA, provides that \u201c[a] statement certified by the court must be placed on the petition for circulation and on the official ballot.\u201d The State of Montana argued in the District Court-as it does here-that if a court certifies a statement, it must then invalidate petitions and signatures thereon which contain the Attorney General\u2019s flawed statements. The District Court relied on <em>State ex rel. Boese v. Waltermire </em>(1986), 224 Mont. 230, 730 P.2d 375, in finding the State\u2019s argument \u201cunpersuasive.\u201d There, this Court addressed \u00a7 13-27-316(2), MCA, in the initiative statutes, which gives opponents of a ballot measure a 10-day period to institute a legal challenge to the Attorney General\u2019s statements about the measure; that subsection, of course, is the \u201cflip side\u201d of \u00a7 13-27-316(1), MCA, the same 10-day period utilized by Proponents of the ballot measure before us in the present case. We concluded that the Legislature\u2019s intent was to provide \u201ca clear and speedy means by which both proponents and opponents <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>could attack the sufficiency\u201d of an attorney general\u2019s statements, and to allow trial court and Supreme Court review \u201cfor correction of any deficiencies so that the initiative might still be presented to the voters at the general election.\u201d <em>Boese, </em>224 Mont. at 232, 730 P.2d at 376. Here, the District Court reasoned that invalidating the previously gathered signatures would contravene these purposes. The District Court also stated that, while the Attorney General\u2019s statements were insufficient and warranted correction, they were not \u201cso inaccurate or misleading as to warrant invalidating signatures already gathered.\u201d I agree entirely with the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-4\">\u00b675 The State attempts to distinguish <em>Boese </em>on grounds that an opponent\u2019s challenge pursuant to \u00a7 13-27-316(2), MCA-rather than a proponent\u2019s challenge pursuant to \u00a7 13-27-316(1), MCA-was at issue in that case, and the challenge in <em>Boese </em>took place before the petition was circulated, unlike the challenge in this case. These factual distinctions do, of course, exist. They do not impact in any way, however, on the gravity and weight of our statements in <em>Boese, </em>or on the importance of the constitutional right of the people of Montana to amend law or the Constitution itself via the initiative process. <em>See </em>Art. Ill, Sec. 4, and Art. XIV, Sec. 9, Mont. Const.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-5\">\u00b676 The State also contends the purposes stated in <em>Boese </em>are frustrated here because \u00a7 13-27-316(1), MCA, and other statutes are designed to prevent proponents of ballot measures from \u201clying in wait in the weeds\u201d so they may collect signatures under one set of statements and seek votes under another. Given the State\u2019s conduct and arguments in the matter now before us, this contention should offend every citizen of Montana regardless of his or her views on this ballot measure. It certainly offends me.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-6\">\u00b677 It is undisputed in this case that Proponents timely filed their complaint pursuant to \u00a7 13-27-316(1), MCA, on March 13, 2006. Summons issued that day and was served on the Attorney General the following day, March 14, 2006. Proponents filed an amended complaint, containing relatively minor changes, on March 22 and served it on the Attorney General the same day. The State\u2019s answer was not filed until April 21, 2006. It is fair to inquire which party was \u201clying in wait in the weeds\u201d with regard to moving this litigation forward.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-7\">\u00b678 Moreover, it is my view that any notion by the State that <em>Proponents </em>desired to seek signatures under one set of statements and votes under another is ludicrous in light of the fact that the timing of the petition and signature gathering processes-pursuant to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>statutory requirements-essentially forced them to collect signatures on petitions containing the very statements by the Attorney General which they timely challenged in the District Court and on which they prevailed there and should prevail here. Indeed, some of the State\u2019s contentions in this appeal cause me concern about its commitment to the initiative process.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-4\">\u00b679 Returning to the State\u2019s reliance on \u00a7 13-27-316(3)(b), MCA, the State argues that, because the court\u2019s certified statements must be placed on the petition for circulation thereunder, and in this case were not, the signatures on Proponents\u2019 petitions must be invalidated (thereby, of course, prohibiting the initiative from being placed on the ballot for a vote). In interpreting statutes, courts employ principles designed to give effect to the legislative will, to avoid an absurd result, to view the statute as a part of a whole statutory scheme and to forward the purpose of that scheme. <em>Orr v. State, </em>2004 MT 354, \u00b6 25, 324 Mont. 391, \u00b6 25, 106 P.3d 100, \u00b6 25 (citation omitted). Here, the plain language of \u00a7 13-27-316(3)(b), MCA, states that any statement certified by the court must be placed both on the petition for circulation and on the official ballot, and supports the State\u2019s argument. It is my view, however, that application of that language in these circumstances would frustrate the overall purpose of \u00a7 13-27-316, MCA, which is intended, ultimately, to afford Montana voters the opportunity to vote on an initiative \u2014 with statements which meet statutory requirements to assist in their understanding. In this respect, I agree with the District Court\u2019s implicit characterization of its corrections in this case as clarifications, rather than major alterations calling into question the validity of the signatures.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-5\">\u00b680 In addition, I believe a literal construction of \u00a7 13-27-316(3)(b), MCA, leads to an \u201cabsurd result,\u201d in that it penalizes the proponents of a proposed initiative-whether they be the Governor, labor unions or Proponents here-for successfully challenging an attorney general\u2019s statements and ensuring that legally appropriate language is placed before Montana voters. Indeed, a future -unscrupulous attorney general could intentionally write biased and inaccurate statements of purpose and implication and then, when those statements were rejected by a court, play the final \u201ctrump card\u201d by successfully urging application of the language in \u00a7 13-27-316(3)(b), MCA. I cannot believe the Legislature intended to vest such power in an attorney general. I also am concerned that future initiative proponents might face the \u201cHobson\u2019s choice\u201d of accepting an attorney general\u2019s insufficient-even <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>biased and inaccurate-statements or risking the loss of previously gathered signatures after a successful court challenge.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-4\">\u00b681 Finally, heeding <em>Orr\u2019s </em>reminder of the importance of viewing a statute as part of an entire statutory \u201cscheme,\u201d I observe \u00a7 13-27-312(5), MCA, provides that \u201c[t]he statement of purpose, <em>unless altered by a court under 13-27-316, </em>is the petition title for the measure circulated by the petition and the ballot title if the measure is placed on the ballot.\u201d (Emphasis added.) I interpret this language to mean that-if a court alters the statement of purpose pursuant to \u00a7 13-27-316, MCA, between the gathering of signatures and the finalizing of the ballot-the petition title and ballot title necessarily cannot be the same and, therefore, the signatures on a petition with a statement of purpose differing from that on the ballot are valid. Indeed, I believe the \u201cunless altered\u201d language in \u00a7 13-27-312(5), MCA, reflects legislative anticipation of the very circumstance presented here-a court\u2019s alteration of a statement of purpose between the time allowed for gathering signatures via petition and finalizing the ballot.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-5\">\u00b682 I dissent from the Court\u2019s opinion reversing the District Court\u2019s determination that the Attorney General\u2019s statements were not sufficient, and from its resulting failure to address whether the District Court correctly refused to invalidate the signatures. I would affirm the District Court in both respects.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
