We reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-10\">\u00b62 We consider the following issue on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b390-11\">\u00b63 Did the District Court err in granting Waite\u2019s motion to suppress based on its determination that the officer lacked particularized suspicion to justify an investigatory stop?</p>\n<p id=\"b390-12\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b390-13\">\u00b64 On October 19, 2003, at approximately 2:30 a.m., Montana <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>Highway Patrol Officer James Kitchin (Kitchin) patrolled north on U.S. Highway 93. He observed a passenger vehicle, later determined to be driven by Waite, following a pickup truck traveling south. Kitchin saw Waite\u2019s car swerve across the center line of the two southbound lanes. He turned his video camera on, and followed her for several miles. Waite\u2019s vehicle drifted across the center line of the two southbound lanes, crossed the fog line, and followed the pickup truck in front of her too closely. Based on his observations, Kitchin activated his lights and began an investigatory traffic stop near Chief Looking Glass Road and U.S. Highway 93. The pickup truck and passenger vehicle both stopped.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-4\">\u00b65 Kitchin approached the driver\u2019s door and informed Waite of the reason for the stop. Kitchin noticed that Waite\u2019s eyes were bloodshot and her speech was slurred. Kitchin asked Waite for her license, registration, and proof of insurance. Waite handed him proof of insurance, but was unable to locate her driver\u2019s license or registration. When Kitchin asked Waite to step from her vehicle, she told him that the driver\u2019s side door did not open. Kitchin instructed Waite to exit from the passenger side door, which she also said did not open. Waite then opened the driver\u2019s side door and exited the vehicle. As Waite stepped out, Kitchin noticed the odor of alcohol coming from her. Waite had to lean on her car for balance, and stated that she could not stand due to two broken feet. Kitchin conducted a Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus (HGN) test on Waite and observed lack of smooth pursuit and nystagmus at maximum deviation. Kitchin placed Waite in his patrol car, and found that her license was revoked and that she had two prior DUI convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-5\">\u00b66 The State charged Waite with driving a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol (DUI), in violation of \u00a7 61-8-401, MCA (2003), and driving while license suspended or revoked, in violation of \u00a7 61-5-212, MCA (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b391-6\">\u00b67 Waite appeared in Justice Court with counsel and moved to suppress the evidence, asserting there were insufficient facts to support a particularized suspicion she was committing an offense, and therefore, Kitchin\u2019s stop was invalid. The Justice of the Peace denied Waite\u2019s motion based on Kitchin\u2019s sworn testimony that Waite was continuously swerving, crossing the center line and fog line, and following too closely. In a Justice Court trial, a jury found Waite guilty of DUI. She appealed to the Fourth Judicial District Court, and again filed a motion to suppress based on the officer\u2019s lack of particularized suspicion.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-7\">\u00b68 The District Court noted that, from its review of Kitchin\u2019s video, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>Waite was driving erratically and following the pickup truck too closely, in violation of \u00a7 61-8-329, MCA (2003). However, the court granted the motion to suppress, concluding that Waite\u2019s swerving within a lane and touching the fog line was insufficient to establish particularized suspicion, and that her action of following too closely could not be considered in the particularized suspicion analysis because Kitchin did not cite Waite with that traffic violation or note it in his report. The State appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-4\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b392-5\">\u00b69 We review a District Court\u2019s grant of a motion to suppress based on a finding of no particularized suspicion to determine whether the court\u2019s findings of fact are clearly erroneous and whether its conclusions of law are correct. <em>State v. </em>Schulke, 2005 MT 77, \u00b6 10, 326 Mont. 390, \u00b6 10, 109 P.3d 744, \u00b6 10 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b392-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b392-7\">\u00b610 The State contends that the District Court erred when it granted Waite\u2019s motion to suppress based on its conclusion there was not particularized suspicion for the stop. The State argues that Waite\u2019s erratic driving was sufficient to establish particularized suspicion, and, further, that the District Court erred in concluding that Kitchin\u2019s failure to cite Waite for following too closely, or note the infraction in his report, precludes consideration of this evidence in the particularized suspicion analysis. In response, Waite contends that simply swerving within a lane and touching the fog line, without a citation for some other driving offense, is insufficient to support a finding of particularized suspicion for a traffic stop.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-8\">\u00b611 Pursuant to \u00a7 46-5-401(1), MCA, \u201ca peace officer may stop any person or vehicle that is observed in circumstances that create a particularized suspicion that the person or occupant of the vehicle has committed, is committing, or is about to commit an offense.\u201d In <em>State v. Gopher, </em>193 Mont. 189, 631 P.2d 293 (1981), we adopted the two-part test enunciated by the United2 States Supreme Court in <em>United States v. Cortez, </em>449 U.S. 411, 101 S. Ct. 690 (1981), to evaluate whether a police officer had a particularized suspicion to make an investigatory stop. Under <em>Gopher, </em>the State has the burden to show: (1) objective data from which an experienced officer can make certain inferences; and (2) a resulting suspicion that the occupant of a certain vehicle is or has been engaged in wrongdoing or was a witness to criminal activity. <em>Gopher, </em>193 Mont. at 194, 631 P.2d at 296. Whether particularized suspicion exists is a question of fact that depends on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>totality of the circumstances. <em>State v. Otto, </em>2004 MT 338, \u00b6 15, 324 Mont. 217, \u00b6 15, 102 P.3d 522, \u00b6 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-4\">\u00b612 The District Court reviewed the video of Waite\u2019s vehicle and stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-5\">[I]t is notable that Defendant\u2019s driving is visibly erratic, the car swerving repeatedly within the lane of traffic, appearing to touch or cross the center line on at least three occasions, as well as touching the fog line within the right lane. The video also shows that Defendant is following her companion\u2019s vehicle, a pickup truck, extremely closely for nearly the entire duration of the video .... It certainly appears from the camera\u2019s view that Defendant is following too closely, in violation of \u00a7 61-8-329, MCA.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b393-6\">\u00b613 The State correctly argues that under <em>Hulse v. State, </em>1998 MT 108, \u00b6 39, 289 Mont. 1, \u00b6 39, 961 P.2d 75, \u00b6 39, \u201cerratic driving\u201d can constitute the basis for a particularized suspicion to stop a vehicle. In <em>Hulse, </em>we discussed erratic driving as including \u201cdriving all over the road, crossing the center line and the fog line, weaving in and out of traffic, or braking for green lights ....\u201d <em>Hulse, </em>\u00b6 39.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-7\">\u00b614  Kitchin\u2019s failure to cite Waite for traffic violations other than DUI and driving while license suspended or revoked does not prohibit consideration of such violations or conduct in determining the existence of particularized suspicion. We note that it is not necessary for an officer to observe a moving violation to establish particularized suspicion to justify a traffic stop. <em>State v. Brander, </em>2004 MT 150, \u00b6 6, 321 Mont. 484, \u00b6 6, 92 P.3d 1173, \u00b6 6. Further, \u201cwe do not require an investigating officer to identify a particular statutory violation and/or cite a defendant for a moving violation to establish a particularized suspicion.\u201d <em>Schulke, </em>\u00b6 18. In <em>Schulke, </em>we found that particularized suspicion existed when the defendant drove at 2:30 a.m., crossed the center line of the fast and slow lanes of traffic, and briefly drove, in part, in a lane reserved for oncoming traffic. <em>Schulke, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 14-15. We determined that the fact the defendant was not cited for improper lane travel, in violation of \u00a7 61-8-328, MCA, did not eliminate that evidence for purposes of determining the existence of particularized suspicion for the traffic stop. <em>Schulke, </em>\u00b6 18.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-8\">\u00b615  The District Court erred by concluding that, because Waite was not cited for the offense, her actions of following too closely could not be considered in determining the existence of particularized suspicion. Waite\u2019s following too closely, in violation of \u00a7 61-8-329, MCA (2003), contributed to the officer\u2019s objective observations even though no citation was issued.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-9\">\u00b616  Similarly, the court erred in concluding that Waite\u2019s actions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>could not be considered because Kitchin failed to note them in his report. Kitchin testified about his observation of Waite\u2019s following too closely, and his failure to include this observation in his report bears solely upon the credibility of his testimony, not to the availability, as a matter of law, of this evidence for purposes of a particularized suspicion determination. Here, of course, the District Court itself observed Waite\u2019s actions on the videotape, and the officer\u2019s credibility was not an issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-4\">\u00b617  Waite contends that the facts of this case are analogous to several cases in which this Court held that questionable driving behaviors observed by police officers were insufficient to allow for particularized suspicion to justify a traffic stop. <em>See State v. Lafferty, </em>1998 MT 247, 291 Mont. 157, 967 P.2d 363 (crossing the fog line twice and driving on it once was insufficient, without other relevant circumstances, for particularized suspicion); <em>Morris v. State, </em>2001 MT 13, 304 Mont. 114, 18 P.3d 1003 (merely \u201cdrifting\u201d over the fog line with no other evidence of speeding or erratic driving insufficient for particularized suspicion); <em>State v. Reynolds, </em>272 Mont. 46, 899 P.2d 540 (1995) (driving which was \u201cbordering on traveling too fast\u201d and waiting too long at an intersection with no traffic laws broken insufficient for particularized suspicion). However, there are additional facts in this case which distinguish it from the above cases. Here, Waite\u2019s crossing of the fog line was only one of several facts giving rise to the officer\u2019s particularized suspicion. Kitchin also observed Waite\u2019s vehicle continuously swerving within the lane, crossing over the center line twice, crossing over the fog line numerous times, and following too closely, all of this occurring late at night. Under the totality of the circumstances, these facts are sufficient to establish a particularized suspicion.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b394-6\">\u00b618  The District Court erroneously concluded that, while sufficient evidence existed for the officer to cite Waite with following too closely, the fact that the officer did not issue a citation or note the infraction in his report precluded that evidence from the particularized suspicion analysis. Waite\u2019s erratic driving, including her following too closely, was sufficient to establish particularized suspicion for the stop.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-7\">\u00b619 Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b394-8\">JUSTICE COTTER, NELSON, LEAPHART and MORRIS concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
