Wise filed a complaint on November 9, 2004, alleging that negligence on the part of LHC caused his accident. Wise also alleged various claims against CNH America, LLC, the manufacturer of the equipment.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-13\">\u00b64 Wise claimed that LHC negligently failed to provide safe working conditions, negligently failed to comply with \u00a7 50-71-201, MCA, requiring certain safety measures, and negligently failed to comply with certain federal regulations concerning equipment safety. Wise asserted at the end of his negligence claim that LHC\u2019s actions and inactions constituted \u201cintentional and deliberate conduct as defined by Section 39-71-413, MCA.\u201d Section 39-71-413(1), MCA, states that an employee who is intentionally injured by an intentional and deliberate act of an employer may bring a cause of action for damages in addition to receiving benefits under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-14\">\u00b65 LHC filed a motion to dismiss Wise\u2019s negligence claim pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6), M.R.Civ.P. LHC argued that the exclusive remedy provision of \u00a7 39-71-411, MCA, barred Wise from bringing his action for damages. LHC contended that Wise\u2019s failure to allege that it committed any \u201cintentional and deliberate\u201d act with the intent to cause Wise an injury under \u00a7 39-71-413, MCA, resulted in exclusion of Wise\u2019s negligence claim by the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act. The District Court agreed and granted LHC\u2019s motion to dismiss. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b207-4\">\u00b66 We review de novo a district court\u2019s ruling on a motion to dismiss pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6), M.R.Civ.P. <em>Hall v. State, </em>2006 MT 37, \u00b6 10, 331 Mont. 171, \u00b6 10, 130 P.3d 601, \u00b6 10. A motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6), M.R.Civ.P., has the effect of admitting all well-pleaded allegations in the complaint. <em>Hall, </em>\u00b6 10. In considering the motion, we construe the complaint in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, and all allegations of fact contained therein are taken as true. <em>Hall, </em>\u00b6 10. A complaint should not be dismissed for failure to state a claim unless it appears beyond doubt that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of a claim that would entitle the plaintiff to relief. <em>Reidelbach v. Burlington Northern Ry. Co., </em>2002 MT 289, \u00b6 14, 312 Mont. 498, \u00b6 14, 60 P.3d 418, \u00b6 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b207-6\">\u00b67 The Workers\u2019 Compensation Act generally provides the exclusive remedy for an employee who suffers an injury in the scope of his or her employment. Section 39-71-411, MCA. An employee may bring an action against an employer or fellow employee, however, \u201c[i]f an employee is intentionally injured by an intentional and deliberate act of the employee\u2019s employer or by the intentional and deliberate act of a fellow employee.\u201d Section 39-71-413(1), MCA. The statute defines intentional injury as \u201can injury caused by an intentional and deliberate act that is specifically and actually intended to cause injury to the employee.\u201d Section 39-71-413(3), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-7\">\u00b68 Wise contends that the general allegation in his complaint that LHC\u2019s negligent actions and inactions constituted \u201cintentional and deliberate\u201d conduct, when viewed in a light most favorable to Wise, satisfied the notice pleading requirements of Rule 8(a), M.R.Civ.P. Pursuant to Rule 8(a), M.R.Civ.P., a complaint must put a defendant on notice of the facts that the plaintiff intends to prove; the facts must disclose the elements necessary to make the claim; and the complaint must demand judgment for the relief sought by the plaintiff. <em>Kunst v. Pass, </em>1998 MT 71, \u00b6 35, 288 Mont. 264, \u00b6 35, 957 P.2d 1, \u00b6 35.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-8\">\u00b69 Wise argues that in order to state a claim under \u00a7 39-71-413, MCA, he only must allege actions that would have constituted \u201cintentional and malicious\u201d conduct as described in <em>Sherner v. Conoco, </em>2000 MT 50, 298 Mont. 401, 995 P.2d 990. In <em>Sherner, </em>we interpreted \u00a7 39-71-413, MCA (1999), to determine that an employer acted with \u201cmalice\u201d if they proceeded with an intentional disregard or indifference to a high probability of injury to the employee. <em>Sherner, </em>\u00b6 37. Wise asserts that no legal distinction exists between the \u201cintentional and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>deliberate\u201d standard of \u00a7 39-71-413, MCA, and the \u201cintentional and malicious\u201d standard discussed in <em>Shemer. </em>Wise maintains that his general allegation that LHC\u2019s conduct constituted \u201cintentional and deliberate\u201d acts properly disclosed the elements of his claim that LHC acted \u201cintentionally and deliberately\u201d by engaging in negligent conduct with an intentional disregard or indifference to a high probability that Wise would suffer an injury. <em>See Kunst, </em>\u00b6 35.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-4\">\u00b610 Wise fails to recognize that the Legislature amended \u00a7 39-71-413, MCA, in 2001 in reaction to our decision in <em>Shemer. </em>The preamble to the amendment refers specifically to <em>Shemer </em>and states that the Legislature intended to modify the standard so that \u201can injured employee has a cause of action for damages against an employer or the employer\u2019s employee only if the employer or fellow employee causes an intentional injury.\u201d 2001 Mont. Laws Ch. 229 (Preamble).</p>\n<p id=\"b208-5\">\u00b611  The amended version of \u00a7 39-71-413, MCA, contains significantly different language than the version we interpreted in <em>Shemer. </em>The Legislature removed the term \u201cmalicious\u201d that the <em>Shemer </em>decision relied upon and replaced it with \u201cdeliberate.\u201d <em>See </em>\u00a7 39-71-413, MCA; \u00a7 39-71-413, MCA (1999). The Legislature also defined an \u201cintentional injury\u201d as an injury caused by a deliberate act with the specific intent of causing an injury. Section 39-71-413(3), MCA. As a result, <em>Shemer </em>no longer represents the standard for determining whether the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act preempts a claim against an employer or fellow employee. In order to state a claim under \u00a7 39-71-413, MCA, an employee now must allege that he or she has been intentionally injured by the intentional act of an employer or fellow employee in order to avoid the exclusivity provision of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-6\">\u00b612  Wise fails to disclose the elements necessary to make a claim against LHC by alleging nothing more than ordinary negligence. <em>See Kunst, </em>\u00b6 35. Wise alleged that LHC negligently failed to provide safe working conditions and negligently failed to comply with state laws and federal regulations. Wise alleged no conduct that could be construed as \u201cintentional and deliberate\u201d acts, other than the general allegation near the end of his complaint. Wise\u2019s attempt to characterize negligent conduct as \u201cintentional and deliberate\u201d fails to bring his claim within the ambit of \u00a7 39-71-413, MCA. LHC\u2019s alleged negligent conduct, viewed in a light most favorable to Wise, remains negligent conduct, and does not rise to the level of an intentional act specifically designed to cause an injury to Wise. <em>See </em>\u00a7 39-71-413, MCA. We agree with the District Court that Wise could not prove any set of facts that would entitle him to relief from LHC beyond the Workers\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>Compensation Act for ordinary negligence. <em>See Reidelbach, </em>\u00b6 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-4\">\u00b613 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b209-5\">JUSTICES WARNER, LEAPHART, NELSON and RICE concur. JUSTICE NELSON concurs.</judges>\n<p id=\"b209-6\">\u00b614 I concur in the Court\u2019s Opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-7\">\u00b615 Section 39-71-413, MCA, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b209-8\">Liability of employer or fellow employee for intentional and deliberate acts-additional cause of action-intentional injury defined. (1) If an employee is intentionally injured by an intentional and deliberate act of the employee\u2019s employer or by the intentional and deliberate act of a fellow employee while performing the duties of employment, the employee or in case of death the employee\u2019s heirs or personal representatives, in addition to the right to receive compensation under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, have a cause of action for damages against the person whose intentional and deliberate act caused the intentional injury.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b209-9\">(2) An employer is not vicariously liable under this section for the intentional and deliberate acts of an employee.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b209-10\">(3) As used in this section, \u201cintentional injury\u201d means an injury caused by an intentional and deliberate act that is specifically and actually intended to cause injury to the employee injured and there is actual knowledge that an injury is certain to occur.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b209-11\">\u00b616 Injured workers or their estates seeking to take advantage of \u00a7 39-71-413, MCA, would be well advised to make their first stop at the Country Attorney\u2019s office in the county where the injury or death occurred. It is obvious that any employer or fellow employee who intentionally and deliberately injures or kills the worker by a deliberate act \u201cthat is specifically and actually intended to cause injury\u201d with \u201cactual knowledge that an injury is certain to occur\u201d (\u00a739-71-413(3), MCA), is guilty of assault, a misdemeanor, in violation of \u00a7 45-5-201, MCA; aggravated assault, a felony, in violation of \u00a7 45-5-202, MCA; or, if the worker is killed, deliberate homicide, a felony, in violation of \u00a7 45-5-102, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-12\">\u00b617 In amending \u00a7 39-71-413, MCA, the Legislature has set a criminal standard for conduct of employers and fellow employees whose knowing, intentional and deliberate conduct injures or kills the worker.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-13\">\u00b618 With that observation, I concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
