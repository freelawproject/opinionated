The District Court granted summary judgment in favor of Oster. County appeals. We affirm in part and reverse in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-9\">ISSUES</p>\n<p id=\"b101-10\">\u00b62 The restated issues on appeal are:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b101-11\">1. Whether Oster is estopped from bringing a claim for unpaid wages against the County.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b101-12\">2. Whether the District Court erred in ruling that County Attorney Oster is entitled to payment of his salary increase by the County.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b101-13\">3. Whether the District Court erred in ruling that Oster is a County employee.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b101-14\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b101-15\">\u00b63 Oster, the elected County Attorney in Valley County, brought suit against the County for underpayment of his salary. Oster filed his claim after the County thrice denied his requests to increase his paychecks to reflect his County-approved pay raise scheduled to take effect on July 1, 2003.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-16\">\u00b64 As part of the County\u2019s annual budgeting process, the three County Commissioners appointed a County Compensation Board (Board), comprised of themselves and Oster in his capacity as County Attorney. On July 28, 2003, in accordance with \u00a7 7-4-2305, MCA, the Board prepared a compensation schedule of salaries for the County\u2019s elected officials, including Oster. The Board recommended to the Commissioners that Oster\u2019s salary be increased by 7%, from $64,843.00 to $69,382.00 for fiscal year 2004, which commenced on July 1, 2003.</p>\n<p id=\"AKu\">\u00b65 During their budget deliberations, members of the Board <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>discussed whether the County or the State Department of Justice (DOJ) would be responsible for funding Oster\u2019s raise. The Board was informed both by their experience in years past and by Oster that the salary of the County Attorney is generally paid half by the County and half by the State. However, each member of the Board had received a memo from the Attorney General\u2019s (AG) office, dated June 4, 2003, explaining that as a result of budget decisions made by the 2003 Legislature, state funds appropriated for State contributions to county attorneys\u2019 salaries for fiscal years 2004 and 2005 would be limited to \u201cfifty percent of the legislature\u2019s understanding of the actual salaries in fiscal year 2003.\u201d The AG advised that the County was not limited by the State\u2019s contribution, but would be responsible for any balance above that budgeted and appropriated by the State. Subsequently, on June 6, 2003, DOJ sent a letter to the Commissioners, Oster, and others with an attached schedule specifying the total amount the State would contribute to Oster\u2019s salary in fiscal year 2004. The letter clarified that $32,422.00 was the \u201cmaximum the state can pay for its share, and is the portion included in the total legislative appropriation for county attorneys.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b102-4\">\u00b66 On July 28, 2003, the Commissioners accepted the Board\u2019s recommendation regarding salaries for the County Attorney and other County officers by Resolution No. 30-2003, and established Oster\u2019s salary at $69,382.00. The Commissioners approved Oster\u2019s raise despite having received information that the State\u2019s contribution would be limited to half of $64,843.00, or $32,422.00.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-5\">\u00b67 Oster\u2019s raise went into effect on July 1,2003. Oster then received bi-weekly paychecks from the County in the amount of $2,571.75, an $87.27 per paycheck shortfall from the County-approved salary he should have received. Oster\u2019s requests that the County make up the shortfall were rejected.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-6\">\u00b68 After the County refused to make up the deficiency, Oster filed suit. The District Court granted Oster\u2019s Motion for Summary Judgment and ordered the County to pay him $3,411.00, representing Oster\u2019s salary shortfall for fiscal year 2004 and a portion of fiscal year 2005, plus statutory penalties, costs and attorney fees. The County appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-7\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b102-8\">\u00b69 We review a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment <em>de novo, </em>and apply the same criteria applied by the district court pursuant to Rule 56(c), M.R.Civ.P. <em>Hanson v. Water Ski Mania Estates, </em>2005 MT 47, \u00b6 11, 326 Mont. 154, \u00b6 11, 108 P.3d 481, \u00b6 11. A district court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>properly grants summary judgment only when no genuine issues of material fact exist, and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. <em>Oberson v. Federated Mut. Ins. Co., </em>2005 MT 329, \u00b6 8, 330 Mont. 1, \u00b6 8, 126 P.3d 459, \u00b6 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-4\">DISCUSSION ISSUE ONE</p>\n<p id=\"b103-5\">\u00b610 <em>1. Whether Oster is estopped from bringing a claim for unpaid wages against the County.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b103-6\">\u00b611 The County argues that Oster\u2019s wage claim against the County should be estopped because Oster knew and actively concealed the fact that the State would contribute only $32,422.00 towards his salary. The County further alleges that Oster misled the Board to its detriment into believing that the State would pay half of his salary increase.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-7\">\u00b612 \u201cEquitable estoppel is not favored and will be sustained only upon clear and convincing evidence.\u201d <em>In re Estate of Hill </em>(1997), 281 Mont. 142, 151, 931 P.2d 1320, 1326 (citation omitted). The defense of equitable estoppel and waiver requires the party invoking its protections to prove each of six elements. The party must show:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b103-8\">1. Conduct, acts, language or silence by the estopped party amounting to a representation or concealment of material facts;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b103-9\">2. These facts were known to the estopped party at the time of the conduct, or at least the circumstances were such that knowledge of them is necessarily imputed to the estopped party;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b103-10\">3. The truth concerning these facts was unknown to the party claiming the benefit of the estoppel at the time they were acted upon;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b103-11\">4. The conduct was done with the intention, or at least the expectation, that it would be acted upon by the other party, or under circumstances that it is both natural and probable that it would be acted upon;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b103-12\">5. The conduct was relied upon by the other party; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b103-13\">6. The other party acted upon it in such a manner as to change the other party\u2019s position for the worse.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b103-14\"><em>In re Estate of Hill, </em>281 Mont. at 150-51, 931 P.2d at 1326 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b103-15\">\u00b613  Equitable estoppel is inapplicable here because the County failed to prove the third element of the defense. It is undisputed that the County received the AG\u2019s June 4, 2003 memorandum as well as DOJ\u2019s June 6, 2003 letter specifying that the State\u2019s contribution to Oster\u2019s salary would be limited to $32,422.00 in fiscal year 2004. Even <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>if we take as true the County\u2019s allegations of misrepresentation by Oster, the fact remains that by virtue of the communications from the State directly to the Board and Commissioners, the County knew the truth of the facts which Oster allegedly misrepresented at the time it approved Oster\u2019s pay raise. We conclude, therefore, that the County cannot prove the necessary elements of estoppel, and its defense fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-4\">ISSUE TWO</p>\n<p id=\"b104-5\">\u00b614 <em>Whether the District Court erred in ruling that County Attorney Oster is entitled to payment of his salary increase by the County.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b104-6\">\u00b615 Resolution of this issue requires reconciliation of three statutes which collectively direct how payment of county attorneys\u2019 salaries is apportioned between the State and Montana\u2019s counties. Section 7-4-2502(2)(a), MCA, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b104-7\">The salary of the county attorney is payable one-half from the general fund of the county and, if the county has supplied the information to the department of justice for inclusion in its budget, the other one-half from the state treasury upon the warrant of the state treasurer. If the county has not supplied information concerning any scheduled or proposed increase in salary for the county attorney to the department of justice for inclusion in material submitted to the budget director under Title 17, chapter 7, part 1, the county is responsible for any increased salary. The state\u2019s share of the county attorney\u2019s salary is payable every 2 weeks.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b104-8\">The general precept that the State and the counties each pay one-half of county attorneys\u2019 salaries is reiterated in \u00a7 7-6-2426(l)(b), MCA, which lists \u201cone-half of the salary of the county attorney\u201d as an enumerated county charge. However, \u00a7 17-7-112(2)(b), MCA, provides that only those funds which DOJ appropriates will account for the State\u2019s contribution to county attorneys\u2019 salaries:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b104-9\">As provided in 7-4-2502(2)(a), the department of justice is not obligated to provide more than one-half of the salary of a county attorney based on the amount included in the department\u2019s budget and appropriated for that purpose.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b104-10\">\u00b616 These statutes appear to conflict when, as here, DOJ\u2019s budgeted and appropriated funds for a county attorney\u2019s salary are less than one-half the salary a county awards its county attorney. As such, County urges this Court to limit the scope of our statutory application to \u00a7\u00a7 7-4-2502 and 7-4-2426, MCA, which, in the County\u2019s view, would relieve it of any obligation to make up the shortfall in Oster\u2019s wages. The County argues that \u00a7 17-7-112(2)(b), MCA, is irrelevant because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>the State is not being asked to pay \u201cmore than one-half\u2019 of Oster\u2019s salary, but rather is being asked to pay one-half of Oster\u2019s <em>actual </em>salary instead of one-half of what DOJ appropriated for Oster\u2019s salary. In so arguing, however, County ignores the operative language contained in the statute which clarifies the State will only pay \u201cone-half of the salary of a county attorney <em>based on the amount included in the department\u2019s budget and appropriated for that purpose.\u201d </em>Section 17-7-112(2)(b), MCA (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b105-4\">\u00b617 This Court\u2019s rules of statutory construction require consideration and application of all three statutes. A presumption exists that the Legislature does not pass meaningless legislation, and accordingly, this Court must harmonize statutes relating to the same subject, as much as possible, giving effect to each. <em>Chain v. Montana Dept, of Motor Vehicles, </em>2001 MT 224, \u00b6 15, 306 Mont. 491, \u00b6 15, 36 P.3d 358, \u00b6 15 (citation omitted). Further, more specific statutes prevail over general provisions of law. <em>Meyer v. Montana Power Co., L.L.C., </em>2005 MT 66, \u00b6 14, 326 Mont. 283, \u00b6 14, 109 P.3d 269, \u00b6 14 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"A4E\">\u00b618 The District Court reconciled the seemingly contradictory provisions of the statutes by interpreting the specific directive set out in \u00a7 17-7-112(2)(b), MCA, as a limitation on the \u201cone-half\u2019 provisions set out in \u00a7\u00a7 7-4-2502 and 7-4-2426, MCA. In so doing, the District Court concluded the State was only obligated to contribute to Oster\u2019s salary the amount budgeted and appropriated for that purpose. If the County had set Oster\u2019s salary at twice the amount budgeted by DOJ, the State\u2019s obligation to pay one-half would have been fully effective. However, the County awarded Oster a salary in excess of twice the amount DOJ appropriated for fiscal year 2004. The District Court further concluded that the County could have avoided this situation by setting its budget for 2004 and 2005 in advance of the 2003 Legislative budget deadlines as provided by \u00a7 7-4-2502, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-5\">\u00b619 It is undisputed that County provided information about Oster\u2019s salary to DOJ prior to DOJ\u2019s reporting deadline. The record does not, however, reflect what specific information the County provided to the State regarding Oster\u2019s scheduled <em>pay raise, </em>or when such information was provided. We cannot therefore determine whether DOJ had the information it needed in time to include Oster\u2019s salary increase in its budget proposal to the 2003 Legislature. Regardless, the record shows that the County was on notice that the State\u2019s contribution to Oster\u2019s salary in fiscal year 2004 would be limited to $32,422.00 (half of $64,843.00) as a consequence of legislative budget decisions made by the 2003 Legislature. This is evidenced by both the AG\u2019s June 4, 2003 memo and the DOJ\u2019s June 6, 2003 letter. Despite this knowledge, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>County on July 28, 2003, by Resolution No. 30-2003, authorized a <em>7% </em>raise for Oster setting his salary at $69,382.00.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-4\">\u00b620  As we concur with the District Court\u2019s interpretation of the three statutes which determine how county attorneys\u2019 salaries are to be paid-namely \u00a7\u00a7 7-4-2502 and 7-4-2426, and 17-7-112(2)(b), MCA-we must conclude that the counties are responsible for any increases in county attorneys\u2019 salaries which are not taken into account and included in DO J\u2019s appropriations for that purpose. We therefore affirm the District Court\u2019s Order requiring the County to pay Oster\u2019s wage shortfall from July 1, 2003, to December 25, 2004, in the amount of $3,411.00.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-5\">ISSUE THREE</p>\n<p id=\"b106-6\">\u00b621 <em>3. Whether the District Court erred in ruling that Oster is a County employee.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b106-7\">\u00b622 In addition to seeking recovery of his salary deficiency, Oster sought relief in the District Court for violation by the County of \u00a7 39-3-206, MCA, which mandates a penalty against employers who fail to pay employees. The County admits it is an \u201cemployer\u201d as defined by the statute, but contends Oster is not the County\u2019s \u201cemployee.\u201d For the purposes of \u00a7 39-3-206, MCA, wage claims, an \u201cemployee\u201d includes \u201cany person who works for another for hire.\u201d Section 39-3-201(4), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"AXl\">\u00b623 In its Order, the District Court determined Oster was an \u201cemployee\u201d of the County as defined by \u00a7 39-3-206, MCA. Further, the District Court found that because the County failed to pay Oster\u2019s wages, Oster was entitled not only to full payment of his wages, but also to a damages penalty in the amount of 110% of his wages, plus costs and attorney fees. For the reasons set forth below, we conclude that Oster is not an \u201cemployee\u201d of the County as defined for purposes of applying \u00a7 39-3-206, MCA, and therefore we reverse the District Court\u2019s Order for a penalty, costs, and attorney fees to be paid by the County.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-8\">\u00b624 Elected county officials are employees of counties for liability purposes. Section 2-9-101(2), MCA; <em>Kenyon v. Stillwater County </em>(1992), 254 Mont. 142, 146, 835 P.2d 742, 745. The question here, however, is whether the County has the authority to hire and fire Oster sufficiently to bring him within the definition of \u201cemployee\u201d as set forth by \u00a7 39-3-201(4), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-9\">\u00b625 Oster was elected to the office of County Attorney by the citizens of Valley County. In <em>Geiger v. Department of Revenue, </em>we evaluated the employment status of an elected county assessor and determined that the county assessor was \u201cemployed\u201d by her constituents, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>served at the pleasure of the voters who elected her. <em>Geiger </em>(1993), 260 Mont. 294, 299, 858 P.2d 1250, 1253. We further concluded that the statutorily-mandated supervisory relationship between the county assessor and the Department of Revenue (DOR) did \u201cnot rise to the level of an employer and employee.\u201d <em>Geiger, </em>260 Mont. at 299, 858 P.2d at 1253. We said that while county assessors are agents of the DOR for some specific purposes, the assessor could be removed from her office only \u201cif the electorate chose to recall her or if she was convicted of official misconduct.\u201d <em>Geiger, </em>260 Mont. at 299, 858 P.2d at 1253. In essence, the county voters hired and employed the county assessor.</p>\n<p id=\"AoM\">\u00b626 Similarly, Oster serves as the County Attorney at the pleasure of the voting citizens of the County. Neither the Commissioners nor any other agent of the County hired Oster or control whether Oster retains his position. Though the Commissioners may appoint a replacement county attorney when the office is vacated between elections as provided by \u00a7 7-4-2702, MCA, the Commissioners may neither hire nor fire the county attorney once the voters have elected him.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-4\">\u00b627 In support of his contention that he is in fact an \u201cemployee\u201d of the County, Oster offers admissions from the County that it \u201cprovides office, staff, and overhead and Oster is the County\u2019s legal counsel.\u201d Additionally, the County\u2019s payroll roster lists Oster as an employee, and a February 2004 Employee Listing shows Oster as an employee and references his employee number and date of employment, among other factors reflecting his relationship with the County. Notwithstanding, we find these factors indeterminate in light of our holding in <em>Geiger, </em>as none of the factors argued by Oster establish the County\u2019s ability to hire, fire, or affirmatively direct Oster\u2019s work as the County Attorney. Quite simply, Oster does not work for the County \u201cfor hire.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b107-5\">\u00b628  Therefore, in keeping with the clear language of \u00a7 39-3-201(4), MCA, and our analysis in <em>Geiger, </em>we conclude that though Oster certainly acts as an agent of the County, in fight of his election and ultimate accountability to the people of Valley County, Oster is not a County \u201cemployee\u201d within the meaning of the above referenced statute. Accordingly, we reverse the District Court\u2019s Order of penalty, costs and attorney fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-6\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b107-7\">\u00b629 For the foregoing reasons, we affirm in part and reverse in part.</p>\n<judges id=\"As2\">JUSTICES NELSON, LEAPHART and MORRIS concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
