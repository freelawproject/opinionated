Copelton (Copelton) appeals from the judgment entered by the Eighteenth Judicial District Court, Gallatin County, on his conviction and sentence for the offense of criminal possession of dangerous drugs with intent to distribute. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-13\">\u00b62 The issue on appeal is whether the District Court erred in denying Copelton\u2019s motion to suppress evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b117-4\">\u00b63 On August 24, 2004, Belgrade City Police Officer Mike Dixon (Dixon) was dispatched to JR\u2019s Lounge in Belgrade, Montana, to investigate a report of suspicious activity involving several persons who appeared to be \u201ccasing\u201d the bar and moving back and forth between the bar and a red vehicle located in the parking lot. Upon arriving at JR\u2019s Lounge, Dixon observed a red vehicle in the parking lot matching the description given in the report. Montana Highway Patrol Officer Jason Hoppert (Hoppert) also responded to JR\u2019s Lounge to provide assistance to Dixon. Hoppert arrived at the location at approximately the same time as Dixon.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-5\">\u00b64 The officers found Copelton sitting inside the red vehicle. Hoppert remained with Copelton while Dixon went to the bar to investigate the report. Dixon made contact inside with Ruben Garcia (Garcia). Garcia stated that he was responsible for the red vehicle, which he had borrowed from a friend in Oregon, and that he, Copelton and another person had traveled from Oregon to Montana in it. Dixon asked Garcia to produce registration for the vehicle. Garcia agreed and accompanied Dixon outside. Garcia walked to the passenger side of the vehicle, reached into the glove box and produced some papers, which he handed to Dixon.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-6\">\u00b65 Dixon then asked Garcia if the officers could search the vehicle. Garcia responded by shrugging his shoulders and making a gesture which the officers interpreted as his consent to the search. The officers began to search the vehicle and discovered methamphetamine. They stopped the search and later obtained a search warrant authorizing a further search of the vehicle during which more methamphetamine was discovered.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-7\">\u00b66 The State of Montana (State) subsequently charged Copelton by information with the felony offense of criminal possession of dangerous drugs with intent to distribute, based on its allegation that Copelton possessed nearly a pound of methamphetamine with the intention of selling it. Copelton moved the District Court to suppress the evidence obtained during the search of the vehicle, arguing that Garcia\u2019s consent to the initial search of the vehicle was not voluntary and there were no other applicable exceptions to the search warrant requirement which authorized the initial search. The District Court held an evidentiary hearing on the motion at which Dixon, Hoppert, Garcia and Copelton testified, and subsequently entered its findings of fact, conclusions of law and order denying Copelton\u2019s motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"ApQ\">\u00b67 Copelton subsequently pled guilty to the charged offense, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>expressly reserving his right to appeal the District Court\u2019s denial of his motion to suppress. The District Court sentenced Copelton to twenty years at the Montana State Prison and entered judgment. Copelton appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-4\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b118-5\">\u00b68 We review a district court\u2019s ruling on a criminal defendant\u2019s motion to suppress evidence to determine whether the court\u2019s findings of fact are clearly erroneous and its interpretation and application of the law correct. <em>State v. Wetzel, </em>2005 MT 154, \u00b6 10, 327 Mont. 413, \u00b6 10, 114 P.3d 269, \u00b6 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b118-7\">\u00b69 <em>Did the District Court err in denying Copelton\u2019s motion to suppress evidence?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b118-8\">\u00b610 The Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution and Article II, Section 11 of the Montana Constitution protect individuals from unreasonable searches and seizures. <em>State v. Snell, </em>2004 MT 269, \u00b6 9, 323 Mont. 157, \u00b6 9, 99 P.3d 191, \u00b6 9. A search or seizure conducted in the absence of a valid warrant is <em>per se </em>unreasonable unless justified by a recognized exception to the warrant requirement. <em>Snell, </em>\u00b6 9. Knowing and voluntary consent to a search is a recognized exception to the warrant requirement. <em>Snell, </em>\u00b6 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-9\">\u00b611 It is undisputed here that the officers did not have a search warrant authorizing the initial search of the vehicle. Based on the testimony presented at the suppression hearing, however, the District Court determined that Garcia gave the officers his knowing and voluntary consent to search the vehicle. Consequently, the court concluded the initial search was justified by the consent exception to the warrant requirement and denied Copelton\u2019s motion to suppress the evidence obtained as a result of the search. Copelton asserts error.</p>\n<p id=\"Agp\">\u00b612 Copelton first contends that the State must establish probable cause for the search in addition to a knowing and voluntary consent to the search, relying on <em>State v. Shaw, </em>2005 MT 141, 327 Mont. 281, 114 P.3d 198. He asserts the State presented no evidence at the suppression hearing establishing the existence of probable cause to search the vehicle. He also points out that the District Court\u2019s order denying his motion to suppress included no findings of fact or conclusions of law regarding the existence of probable cause to search. On that basis, he argues the District Court incorrectly applied the law and, therefore, erred in denying his motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>\u00b613 The State responds that there is no probable cause requirement for a search where the investigating officers obtain knowing and voluntary consent prior to conducting the search. The State contends we previously addressed and rejected an identical probable cause argument in <em>Snell. </em>We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-4\">\u00b614 In <em>Snell, </em>a highway patrol officer stopped the defendant for speeding. After issuing the defendant a citation for failure to carry proof of insurance, the officer asked if he could search the defendant\u2019s vehicle. The defendant consented and the officer found marijuana and drug paraphernalia in the vehicle. The defendant subsequently moved the district court to suppress the drug evidence obtained during the search. He conceded he voluntarily consented to the search and the State conceded the officer did not have probable cause for the search. <em>Snell, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 3-6. The district court relied on <em>State v. Parker, </em>1998 MT 6, 287 Mont. 151, 953 P.2d 692, in concluding that an officer need not have probable cause where there is voluntary consent to a search, and denied the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress. <em>Snell, </em>\u00b6 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-5\">\u00b615 On appeal, the defendant argued that the rule stated in <em>Parker </em>conflicted with our subsequent decision in <em>State v. Elison, </em>2000 MT 288, \u00b6 54, 302 Mont. 228, \u00b6 54, 14 P.3d 456, \u00b6 54, in which we stated that a warrantless vehicle search requires both probable cause and a recognized exception to the warrant requirement such as plain view, search incident to arrest or exigent circumstances. The defendant asserted that, although he voluntarily consented to the search of his vehicle, the officer did not have the requisite probable cause for the search and, therefore, the search was unlawful pursuant to <em>Elison. Snell, </em>\u00b6 11. We concluded, however, that the two cases were not in conflict because <em>Parker </em>directly addressed the consent exception to the warrant requirement without requiring a finding of probable cause, while <em>Elison </em>addressed the exigent circumstances exception and did not impose a probable cause requirement on consensual searches. <em>Snell, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 12-15. Consequently, we affirmed the district court\u2019s conclusion that the defendant\u2019s voluntary consent was sufficient, in and of itself, to justify the warrantless search of his vehicle. <em>Snell, </em>\u00b6 17.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-6\">\u00b616 Less than a year after <em>Snell, </em>we decided <em>Shaw. </em>There, a deputy sheriff stopped the defendant for speeding. During the course of the stop, the deputy asked the defendant whether he could search her car and the defendant consented. The deputy discovered an open container of alcohol and drug paraphernalia in the vehicle. The State subsequently charged the defendant with several drug-, alcohol- and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>driving-related offenses. The defendant moved to suppress the evidence obtained during the search of her vehicle, arguing that the deputy had coerced her consent to the search by using threats. The district court denied the motion. <em>Shaw, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 3-4.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-4\">\u00b617 In addressing the consent to search issue on appeal, we cited <em>Elison </em>for the proposition that \u201c[a] warrantless search of a vehicle in Montana requires both the existence of probable cause and a generally recognized exception to the warrant requirement.\u201d <em>Shaw, </em>\u00b6 7. We then concluded, based on the facts and circumstances of the case, that the deputy possessed the requisite probable cause and the defendant knowingly and voluntarily consented to the search of her vehicle. <em>Shaw, </em>\u00b6 12. Nowhere in <em>Shaw </em>did we reference <em>Snell </em>and our holding therein that there is no probable cause requirement for a warrantless search of an automobile based on a knowing and voluntary consent to the search.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-5\">\u00b618  We take this opportunity to reaffirm our holding in <em>Snell. </em>A knowing and voluntary consent, in and of itself, is sufficient to justify a warrantless search of an automobile. Therefore, we reverse that portion of <em>Shaw </em>which requires a finding of probable cause in conjunction with the consent exception to the search warrant requirement. As a result, we need address only Copelton\u2019s arguments regarding the knowing and voluntary nature of Garcia\u2019s consent to the vehicle search.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-6\">\u00b619  Courts apply the totality of the circumstances test in determining whether consent has been voluntarily given and is uncontaminated by coercion or duress. <em>Wetzel, </em>\u00b6 16. Thus, the determination of voluntariness of consent is dependent on the facts of each case, with no single fact being dispositive. <em>State v. Dawson </em>(1988), 233 Mont. 345, 352, 761 P.2d 352, 356.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-7\">\u00b620 Garcia, Dixon, Hoppert and Copelton testified at the hearing on Copelton\u2019s motion to suppress. The following facts, supported by testimony at the hearing and found by the District Court, are essentially undisputed. Garcia was born in Mexico and has lived in the United States since 1993. He received six years of education while growing up in Mexico. At the time of the vehicle search at issue here, Garcia was 29 years old and had only a limited understanding of the English language. Garcia testified, however, that he had prior experiences with law enforcement officers and has had his vehicle searched on other occasions. He further stated that, notwithstanding his limited knowledge of English, he clearly understood what Dixon was asking when the officer requested his consent to search the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>vehicle. In response to Dixon\u2019s request, Garcia shrugged his shoulders and gestured with his hands in an affirmative manner. Garcia testified that he consented to the search and did not care whether the officers searched the vehicle because he did not have anything to hide.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-4\">\u00b621 Dixon and Hoppert both testified that, upon being asked to consent to a search of the vehicle, Garcia responded by shrugging his shoulders, nodding his head affirmatively and saying \u201cyeah\u201d or \u201cyeah, sure.\u201d Dixon conceded that he did not inform Garcia of his right to refuse to consent to the search. Copelton also testified that, after Dixon requested permission to search the vehicle, Garcia shrugged his shoulders, gestured and looked at Copelton. Copelton interpreted Garcia\u2019s movements as asking Copelton for advice on how to respond to Dixon.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-5\">\u00b622 Based on the above facts, the District Court concluded that \u201c[u]nder the totality of the circumstances Garcia\u2019s consent was freely and voluntarily given and uncontaminated by any express or implied duress or coercion.\u201d Copelton asserts that this conclusion is erroneous. He contends that three factors exist which establish that Garcia\u2019s consent to the vehicle search was not knowingly and voluntarily given.</p>\n<p id=\"A_8\">\u00b623  First, Copelton argues that Garcia\u2019s limited education with no instruction regarding the American legal system weighs heavily against his ability to voluntarily consent to a search. However, Copelton provides no authority for the proposition that an American education or instruction on the American legal system is required for a person to be able to knowingly and voluntarily consent to a search. Moreover, Garcia testified that he had prior experiences with law enforcement while in the United States, including prior vehicle searches, and he understood what Dixon was asking when the officer requested to search the vehicle. Garcia stated that he consented to the search because he had nothing to hide and did not care whether the officers looked through the vehicle. We conclude that Garcia\u2019s limited foreign education did not impede his ability to knowingly and voluntarily consent to the vehicle search.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-6\">\u00b624  Second, Copelton asserts that Garcia\u2019s limited understanding of the English language at the time of the search indicates he could not knowingly consent to the search and that \u201c[i]t is unclear that Garcia fully understood what he was being asked to do.\u201d As discussed above, however, this assertion directly contradicts Garcia\u2019s testimony at the suppression hearing. We conclude Garcia\u2019s limited abilities to speak and understand English did not impede his ability to knowingly and voluntarily consent to the search.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>\u00b625  Third, Copelton contends that the fact that the officers did not inform Garcia he had the right to refuse to consent to the vehicle search weighs in favor of a determination that the consent was not knowing and voluntary. Copelton concedes, however, that lack of knowledge of the right to refuse consent is not determinative that the consent was not voluntary in and of itself. <em>See Wetzel, </em>\u00b6 19. In light of Garcia\u2019s statement that he did not care whether the officers searched the vehicle, we conclude the officers\u2019 failure to inform him of his right to refuse to consent does not render his consent unknowing or involuntary under the totality of the circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-4\">\u00b626 Finally, Copelton makes a passing assertion that <em>\u201ca </em>mere shrug of the shoulders was not enough to indicate to the officers that Garcia was giving consent to search.\u201d We have held, however, that nonverbal consent can be effective where the conduct indicates unequivocal consent to the search. In <em>Dawson, </em>we concluded that, where a law enforcement officer requested permission to enter the defendant\u2019s motel room, the defendant\u2019s actions of stepping back, opening the door wider and not objecting by words or action to the officer\u2019s entry into the room indicated unequivocal, voluntary consent. <em>Dawson, </em>233 Mont. at 352-53, 761 P.2d at 357. Here, Garcia, Dixon and Hoppert all testified that Garcia responded to Dixon\u2019s request to search the vehicle by shrugging his shoulders, nodding his head and making an affirmative gesture with his hands. All three further testified that Garcia\u2019s affirmative gestures clearly indicated his consent to the vehicle search. Copelton\u2019s argument in this regard is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"A6B\">\u00b627  We conclude the District Court did not err in determining that, under the totality of the circumstances, Garcia\u2019s consent to the vehicle search was freely and voluntarily given. We hold, therefore, that the District Court did not err in denying Copelton\u2019s motion to suppress evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-5\">\u00b628 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b122-6\">JUSTICES COTTER, LEAPHART, WARNER and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
