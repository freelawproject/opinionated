On appeal, LaRue objects to the modification on four independent grounds related to the circumstances and manner in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>which the District Court adopted the new plan. Because we find her second assignment of error dispositive, we do not consider the other three.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-4\">\u00b62 The sole issue under review, therefore, is whether the District Court erred when it modified the parenting plan without taking testimony, hearing evidence, and entering findings of fact and conclusions of law regarding a change in circumstances or the statutory criteria set forth in \u00a7\u00a7 40-4-212 and -219, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-5\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b348-6\">\u00b63 The parenting plan at issue in this case has been the subject of protracted litigation in the District Court, as well as a previous appeal to this Court (see <em>Jacobsen v. Thomas, </em>2004 MT 273, 323 Mont. 183, 100 P.3d 106). On May 14, 2001, the District Court entered a decree dissolving LaRue\u2019s marriage to Arne John Jacobsen (\u201cArne\u201d). Incorporated into the decree was a stipulated parenting plan for the parties\u2019 two children (Jonah, born March 1997, and Savannah, born August 1998), pursuant to which LaRue and Arne were to share parenting of the children equally on an alternating week schedule.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-7\">\u00b64 Following contempt motions filed by Arne in May and July 2001, the District Court appointed a guardian ad litem (\u201cGAL\u201d) for the children. In due course, the GAL recommended that Arne be made the primary residential parent of the children at the location of his choice. The court held hearings in October and November 2001, after which it vacated the stipulated parenting plan, issued a holiday season parenting schedule, and granted Arne\u2019s request to relocate with the children to Park City, Utah.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-8\">\u00b65 Eleven months later, in October 2002, following numerous proceedings in the District Court, the submission of a final report by the GAL, and a final hearing held August 20, 2002, the District Court issued an order naming Arne as the primary caregiver and adopting a parenting plan proposed by Arne.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Pursuant to this plan, the children were to reside with Arne during the school year and with LaRue during the summer months, with additional visitation dates by the non-residential parent (LaRue during the school year and Arne during the summer months) specified in the plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-9\">\u00b66 LaRue appealed the District Court\u2019s order. Among other things, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>she claimed that modification of the stipulated parenting plan was improper because the District Court had not found that there was a change in circumstances warranting a modification and because the District Court had failed to properly assess the best interests of the children. <em>See Jacobsen, </em>\u00b6 41. We affirmed on September 28, 2004, holding (with respect to this particular claim) that while the District Court had not used the \u201cchange of circumstances\u201d language, the reality that a change in circumstances had occurred was implicit in the court\u2019s findings, <em>see Jacobsen, </em>\u00b6 44, as was the court\u2019s assessment of the best interests of the children, <em>see Jacobsen, </em>\u00b6 45.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-4\">\u00b67 Meanwhile, LaRue filed a motion to appoint a special master to assist her and Arne in resolving their ongoing co-parenting conflicts. On June 18,2004, the District Court appointed Liz Dalton, with whom the parties had contracted on another occasion. The court specified that Ms. Dalton\u2019s authority and responsibilities were limited to the terms of the Special Master Agreement which, with respect to a parenting plan, provided that \u201c[djuring the contract term, Ms. Dalton will assist us design a Parenting Plan that will guide our long-term success as co-parents.\u201d The Agreement also stated, however, that Ms. Dalton \u201cwill honor all prior court orders and will not redesign any provision of a parenting plan unless [LaRue and Ame] agree to a modification.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b349-5\">\u00b68 The events giving rise to the present appeal took place in November and December 2004. On November 17, Ms. Dalton emailed the GAL concerning two recent incidents involving LaRue and a dispute over her midweek visitations. Specifically, Ms. Dalton alleged that two days earlier, LaRue had \u201crefused to leave my home-office following her 4 p.m. appointment ... until I had written or faxed a \u2018decision\u2019 in her favor.\u201d The situation apparently was resolved approximately five hours later when LaRue\u2019s boyfriend arrived at Dalton\u2019s home and persuaded LaRue to leave. In addition, Ms. Dalton related an incident wherein LaRue allegedly attempted to take the children from school at an unscheduled time and, in the process, injured the school principal. Ms. Dalton indicated that she was \u201cconsidering suspending LaRue\u2019s parenting time until we can clearly draft an order (as a team effort) that spells out her parenting time in such a manner that she will agree to.\u201d Ms. Dalton requested a conference call to discuss the matter further.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-6\">\u00b69 The next day (November 18, 2004), based on Ms. Dalton\u2019s email, the GAL filed in the District Court a motion captioned \u201cEmergency Ex Parte Motion for Order Suspending Parenting Time for Mother.\u201d Given <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>\u201cthe severity of the incidents\u201d described above and the fact that LaRue\u2019s next scheduled parenting time began that same day (November 18), the GAL requested that \u201cLaRue\u2019s parenting time be suspended by this Court immediately until a team conference call can be held which can further delineate and clarify LaRue\u2019s responsibilities, and that plan agreed to by the parties or ordered by this Court.\u201d The District Court granted the GAL\u2019s motion on November 18 and further ordered that LaRue appear before the court on December 13,2004, \u201cto show Cause why this Order should not be made permanent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b350-4\">\u00b610 At the December 13 hearing, however, the District Court did not address the show cause issue. Rather, the court focused on a report and proposed parenting plan (dated December 13, 2004) that Ms. Dalton had faxed to the parties and the court earlier that day. Both Arne and the GAL were in agreement with Ms. Dalton\u2019s recommendations (which included making Arne\u2019s residence the children\u2019s \u201cprimary residence\u201d and restricting LaRue\u2019s summer time to \u201cup to 4 weeks\u201d with the children); however, LaRue\u2019s counsel raised a number of matters requiring clarification. Thus, the judge referred the parties and their respective counsel to his chambers to contact Ms. Dalton by telephone and work on the unresolved issues. The court also stated that it intended to adopt the elements of Ms. Dalton\u2019s report, though it was not adopting the report \u201cas evidence,\u201d and that \u201c[i]f [the parties] need to submit written amendments later or something comes to mind that you now see or hear or [the GAL] sees or hears, you\u2019ll all have the same time frame to respond, and then I can enter the final order.\u201d Lastly, the court stated that it would be entering a temporary order that day incorporating Ms. Dalton\u2019s report with any modifications agreed upon by the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-5\">\u00b611 The record does not disclose whether the parties in fact conferred with Ms. Dalton in the District Judge\u2019s chambers and, if so, what the outcome of that conference was. LaRue indicates in her briefs that the parties did not reach an agreement, that they returned home, and that they did not go back before the court for a hearing. In any event, the next action taken by the District Court was the entry on December 29, 2004, of an order stating only that the December 13, 2004, parenting plan developed by Ms. Dalton \u201cis hereby adopted and made final.\u201d The next day, however, the court issued a second order vacating the court\u2019s November 18, 2004, order (which had suspended LaRue\u2019s parenting time) and stating that Ms. Dalton\u2019s December 13,2004, parenting plan would govern \u201cuntil otherwise determined by the court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"Arm\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>\u00b612 Given the apparent conflict between these two orders, the GAL filed a Request for Clarification. On March 3,2005, the court issued an order clarifying that the December 30,2004, order \u201cis an interim order documenting the oral order of the Court as of the December 13, 2004 hearing\u201d and that the December 29,2004, order adopting Ms. Dalton\u2019s parenting plan \u201cis the final order of the Court.\u201d LaRue filed a timely notice of appeal from the court\u2019s December 29, 2004, order.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-4\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b351-5\">\u00b613 Our usual standard of review with respect to parenting plan modifications is as follows: we review the findings underlying a district court\u2019s decision to modify a parenting plan to determine whether those findings are clearly erroneous; and when the findings upon which the modification decision is predicated are not clearly erroneous, we will reverse the district court\u2019s decision only where an abuse of discretion is clearly demonstrated. <em>In re Marriage of Oehlke, </em>2002 MT 79, \u00b6 9, 309 Mont. 254, \u00b6 9, 46 P.3d 49, \u00b6 9. In a case such as this, however, where the allegation is that the district court made no such findings in the first place and the issue is whether the court\u2019s action conforms to statutory requirements, we are presented with a question of law, which we review <em>de novo. See In re </em>T.H., 2005 MT 237, \u00b6 35, 328 Mont. 428, \u00b6 35, 121 P.3d 541, \u00b6 35 (\u201cWe review a district court\u2019s interpretation and application of statutes for correctness.\u201d); <em>Wombold v. Assoc. Financial Services Co., </em>2004 MT 397, \u00b6 30, 325 Mont. 290, \u00b6 30, 104 P.3d 1080, \u00b6 30 (\u201cIssues of statutory interpretation are reviewed <em>de novo.\u201d); cf. State v. Williams, </em>2003 MT 136, \u00b6 8, 316 Mont. 140, \u00b6 8, 69 P.3d 222, \u00b6 8 (\u2018Where . . . the issue on appeal is whether the trial court followed the statutory requirements for a sentence revocation, the question is a matter of law, and our review is plenary.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b351-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b351-7\">\u00b614 <em>Did the District Court err when it modified the parties\u2019 parenting plan without taking testimony, hearing evidence, and entering findings of fact and conclusions of law regarding a change in circumstances or the statutory criteria set forth in \u00a7\u00a7 40-4-212 and -219, MCA ?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b351-8\">\u00b615 LaRue argues that that the District Court did not comply with the statutory criteria governing modifications to parenting plans. She points out that the court did not take any testimony, receive any evidence, or hear any arguments at the December 13, 2004, hearing. As noted above, the District Court stated at that hearing that it was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number><em>\u201cnot </em>adopting [Ms. Dalton\u2019s] report as evidence\u201d (emphasis added). Nor did the court enter any findings of fact and conclusions of law in conjunction with its December 29, 2004, order adopting Ms. Dalton\u2019s parenting plan. The court\u2019s failure to do so, LaRue concludes, is error. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-4\">\u00b616 Section 40-4-219(1), MCA, provides, in relevant part, that a District Court</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b352-5\">may in its discretion amend a prior parenting plan <em>if it finds, upon the basis of facts </em>that have arisen since the prior plan or that were unknown to the court at the time of entry of the prior plan, that a change has occurred in the circumstances of the child and that the amendment is necessary to serve the best interest of the child. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b352-6\">As this language makes clear, in order to modify the parties\u2019 existing parenting plan the District Court was required <em>first </em>to find (1) that a change had occurred in Jonah\u2019s and/or Savannah\u2019s circumstances and (2) that an amendment to the parenting plan was necessary to serve the children\u2019s best interests. (Section 40-4-212(1), MCA, sets forth a number of factors that a court shall consider in determining \u201cthe best interest of the child.\u201d) These two findings, in turn, were required to be based on facts that had arisen since the prior plan was entered or that were unknown to the court at the time the prior plan was entered.</p>\n<p id=\"AHU\">\u00b617 Arne observes that \u201cLaRue did not file any motions or notices requesting a hearing so that she could present testimony and evidence. Nor did she file any written amendments or specific objections to the December 13 parenting plan [proposed by Ms. Dalton]. LaRue did not request that the district court schedule another hearing so that she could present testimony and evidence.\u201d The GAL similarly points out that \u201cneither party filed any objection or amendment in the twelve days before the court adopted [Ms. Dalton\u2019s] parenting plan as its final order.\u201d However, this overlooks the requirements of the statute. In <em>In re Marriage of Oehlke, </em>2002 MT 79, 309 Mont. 254, 46 P.3d 49, we characterized the statutory finding of changed circumstances as a \u201cprerequisite\u201d to amending a prior parenting plan and stated that \u201ca district court may not modify an existing custody arrangement\u201d without such a finding. <em>Oehlke, </em>\u00b6 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-7\">\u00b618 As far as we can discern from the record, the District Court did not abide by the foregoing requirements of <em>Oehlke </em>and \u00a7 40-4-219(1), MCA. There is no explicit indication that the court found, based on new or previously unknown facts, a change in circumstances and then determined, in conformance with \u00a7 40-4-212(1), MCA, that adoption of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>the new plan was necessary to serve the best interests of the children. In contrast to its order of October 29, 2002 <em>(see </em>note 1, <em>supra), </em>the court\u2019s December 29, 2004, order consisted of a single sentence: \u201cIT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the attached Parenting Plan developed by Elizabeth A. Dalton, Esq., is hereby adopted and made final.\u201d This is insufficient to satisfy the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-4\">\u00b6 19 \u201cAdequate findings and conclusions are essential for without them this Court is forced to speculate as to the reasons for the District Court\u2019s decision. Such a situation is not a healthy basis for review.\u201d <em>Jones v. Jones </em>(1980), 190 Mont. 221, 224, 620 P.2d 850, 852. <em>In re Marriage of Converse </em>(1992), 252 Mont. 67, 826 P.2d 937, illustrates this point. There was nothing in the record in <em>Converse </em>demonstrating that the statutory criteria for making custody determinations had been considered by the district court. We observed that \u201c[i]f some or all of the factors were considered during the off the record conference between the trial judge and counsel for the parties, this is not reflected in the record. Even if the relevant factors had been considered, there was nothing in the trial court\u2019s findings indicating the basis for the custody decision in relation to the factors.\u201d <em>Converse, </em>252 Mont. at 71, 826 P.2d at 940. Given that a district court\u2019s findings should, \u201cat a minimum, set forth the essential and determining facts upon which the [court] rested its conclusion on the custody issue,\u201d <em>Converse, </em>252 Mont. at 71, 826 P.2d at 939 (internal quotation marks omitted), we remanded the case to the district court \u201cto receive evidence relative to the statutory factors necessary for a determination of custody and for <em>explicit </em>findings setting forth at least the essential and determining facts upon which the District Court rests its conclusion on custody,\u201d <em>Converse, </em>252 Mont. at 72, 826 P.2d at 940 (emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted). <em>See also In re Marriage of Keating </em>(1984), 212 Mont. 462, 467, 689 P.2d 249, 252 (observing that an award of custody cannot be upheld \u201c[ajbsent an indication that the trial court considered all of the statutorily mandated factors\u201d and remanding the case to the district court \u201cfor appropriate findings . . . .\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b353-5\">\u00b620  Our holding in <em>Converse </em>mandates the same result here. Given the absence in the record of <em>any </em>findings by the District Court-let alone the prerequisite finding of a change in circumstances-supporting its December 29,2004, order, the court\u2019s purported modification of the parties\u2019 parenting plan is invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-6\">\u00b621 Lastly, we would simply note that the District Court\u2019s \u201cclarification\u201d order of March 3,2005 (subsequent to the order at issue in this case), purported to grant LaRue\u2019s July 30, 2004, motion to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>\u201ctransfer jurisdiction\u201d of the action to the courts of Utah. However, no argument has been made with regard to this issue, and we decline to address it.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-4\">\u00b622 We therefore remand this case to the District Court to receive evidence relative to the statutory requirements necessary to modify an existing parenting plan and to enter findings setting forth the facts upon which the court rests its final determination, and for further proceedings as may be required.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-5\">\u00b623 Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b354-6\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES NELSON, WARNER and MORRIS concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b348-10\"> The court\u2019s twenty-four-page order was supported by extensive findings of fact, a comprehensive assessment of most of the \u201cbest interest of the child\u201d and \u201cparenting\u201d factors <em>(see </em>\u00a7 40-4-212(1), MCA), and conclusions of law.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
