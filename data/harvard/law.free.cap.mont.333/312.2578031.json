We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-11\">\u00b62 On November 17, 2004, pursuant to a plea agreement, Zito pled guilty to several drug related felonies and a misdemeanor, reserving his right to appeal the denial of his motions to suppress and dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"AhU\">\u00b63 Zito moved to suppress all evidence obtained by virtue of a search of his property on October 23, 2003, pursuant to a search warrant issued the previous day. He also moved to suppress statements he made to law enforcement at the time of his arrest. The motion was heard, and on April 9, 2004, the District Court entered its findings of fact and conclusions of law and order denying Zito\u2019s motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-12\">\u00b64 Ravalli County Sheriffs Detective Jase Basnaw applied for and was granted a search warrant for Zito\u2019s property on October 22, 2003, the same day a confidential informant had reported seeing marijuana plants at Zito\u2019s residence. The warrant was issued by the Ravalli County Justice Court. On October 23, 2003, several members of the Ravalli County Sheriffs Office, including Detective Basnaw, and officers from the Montana State Division of Criminal Investigation executed the search warrant. The search resulted in the confiscation of approximately fifty marijuana plants located in an abandoned basement, under a canopy, and in several other places unobservable from the air. The marijuana plants were in the process of being harvested and dried. The search also produced paraphernalia related <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>to the production and use of marijuana, as well as a number of guns. Zito was found hiding in a gully approximately two hours after the search commenced.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-4\">\u00b65 Upon consideration of the affidavit in support of the search warrant, the reviewing District Court found the facts supporting the warrant to be as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b338-5\">(1) On September 18, 2003, a concerned citizen informed Detective Basnaw that Mr. Zito was growing marijuana at his place. This tip was not based on personal observation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b338-6\">(2) On September 29,2003, Cl [Confidential Informant] met \u2022with Detective Basnaw and informed him that Mr. Zito currently had a grow operation at his place, under a yellow tarp in front of his residence and in a pump house. Cl said that plants were budding and ready for harvest. Cl, by virtue of the absence of a sworn statement attesting to Cl\u2019s veracity, is not deemed a reliable informant. Cl\u2019s tip was not based on Cl\u2019s personal observation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b338-7\">(3) On October 1, 2003, Detective Basnaw flew over the property and took photographs of planter boxes, several pots, and a yellow tarp in front of Mr. Zito\u2019s residence. The cultivation indicia were obscured from view on the ground by natural barriers and junk vehicles.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b338-8\">(4) On October 1,2003, following the flight, Detective Basnaw met with Cl and showed Cl the photographs. Cl confirmed the area in the photos where the marijuana was grown, identified the planter boxes as the site where marijuana was grown during the summer of2002, gave the reason for the use of the tarp as provided by Mr. Zito\u2019s sons, and identified an unfinished, covered basement in the photos as the location for hanging the plants to dry. Except for identifying the planter boxes, Cl\u2019s information was not based on personal observation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b338-9\">(5) On October 4, 2003, Cl informed Detective Basnaw that Cl had been to Mr. Zito\u2019s residence, and although Cl was not in a position to see the marijuana plants, Cl smelled them.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b338-10\">(6) On October 22, 2003, Cl informed Detective Basnaw that Cl had been to Mr. Zito\u2019s residence and had seen approximately 30[,] four to five foot long marijuana plants hanging on the south wall of the unfinished basement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b338-11\">(7) Mr. Zito has a prior drug-related criminal conviction.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b338-12\">(8) Viewing all these facts through the lens of his significant training and experience, Detective Basnaw concludes that Mr.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b339-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>Zito is growing marijuana.!<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b339-4\">\u00b66 We review a district court\u2019s denial of a motion to suppress to determine whether the court\u2019s findings of fact are clearly erroneous and whether its interpretation and application of the law are correct. <em>State v. Meyer, </em>2004 MT 272, \u00b6 11, 323 Mont. 173, \u00b6 11, 99 P.3d 185, \u00b6 11; <em>State v. Martinez, </em>2003 MT 65, \u00b6 19, 314 Mont. 434, \u00b6 19, 67 P.3d 207, \u00b6 19. Zito does not challenge the factual findings relevant to the search warrant, thus we address whether the District Court properly applied the law in concluding that the affidavit in support of the warrant was sufficient to establish probable cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-5\">\u00b67  We have adopted the \u201ctotality of the circumstances\u201d test set forth in <em>Illinois v. Gates </em>(1983), 462 U.S. 213, 103 S.Ct. 2317, 76 L.Ed.2d 527, to evaluate whether probable cause supported the issuance of a warrant. <em>State v. Barnaby, </em>2006 MT 203, \u00b6 29, 333 Mont. 220, \u00b6 29, 142 P.3d 809, \u00b6 29; <em>State v. Reesman, </em>2000 MT 243, \u00b6 24, 301 Mont. 408, \u00b6 24, 10 P.3d 83, \u00b6 24. Under the totality of the circumstances test, the issuing judicial officer must make a practical, common sense determination, given all the evidence contained in the application for a search warrant, whether a fair probability exists that contraband or evidence of a crime will be found in a particular place. <em>Barnaby, </em>\u00b6 29; <em>Reesman, </em>\u00b6 24; <em>Gates, </em>462 U.S. at 238, 103 S.Ct. at 2332, 76 L.Ed.2d at 548.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-6\">\u00b68 Our function as a reviewing court is to ensure ultimately that the issuing judicial officer had a \u201csubstantial basis\u201d to determine probable cause existed before issuing the search warrant. <em>Barnaby, </em>\u00b6 30. However, it is critical in our review that a judicial officer\u2019s determination that probable cause exists be paid great deference and every reasonable inference possible be drawn to support that determination. <em>Reesman, </em>\u00b6 19; <em>Gates, </em>462 U.S. at 236, 103 S.Ct at 2331, 76 L.Ed.2d at 547 (\u201cmagistrate\u2019s determination of probable cause should be paid great deference by reviewing courts.\u201d) (internal quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b339-7\">\u00b69  An application for a search warrant must state facts sufficient to show probable cause to issue a warrant. <em>Barnaby, </em>\u00b6 30. A determination of probable cause does not require facts sufficient to make a showing of criminal activity; rather, the issuing judicial officer must only determine that there exists a probability of criminal activity. <em>Barnaby, </em>\u00b6 30; <em>State v. Rinehart </em>(1993), 262 Mont. 204, 210, 864 P.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>1219, 1222. Probable cause must be determined solely from the information contained within the search warrant application. <em>Barnaby, </em>\u00b6 30; <em>Rinehart, </em>262 Mont. at 211, 864 P.2d at 1223.</p>\n<p id=\"AX1\">\u00b610 The affidavit in support of the warrant in this case stated the informant had told Detective Basnaw that he had been to Zito\u2019s property about eighteen days prior, and he had smelled marijuana plants there. Further, this same informant told Detective Basnaw that he had been on the subject property the same day the affidavit was presented, and had seen over thirty marijuana plants. The informant was not anonymous, and the information he provided was not hearsay. Thus, if the informant could be shown to be reliable, there was probable cause to issue the search warrant. <em>Reesman, </em>\u00b6 31.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-5\">\u00b611 Detective Basnaw\u2019s affidavit in support of the warrant stated that the informant had a documented history with marijuana, and that Detective Basnaw knew from experience that the informant would recognize marijuana. The affidavit also detailed the relevant information provided by the informant as noted above in \u00b6\u00b6 5 and 10. However, the affidavit did not expressly state that the informant had provided reliable information in the past, was making a statement against his interest, or was acting as a concerned citizen. <em>See Reesman, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 32-35. Where such a statement is lacking, a confidential informant\u2019s information regarding criminal activity requires further corroboration in order to supply a judicial officer with a sufficient substantial basis for a probable cause determination. <em>State v. St. Marks, </em>2002 MT 285, \u00b6 25, 312 Mont. 468, \u00b6 25, 59 P.3d 1113, \u00b6 25.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-6\">\u00b612 The corroboration must reveal indicia of human conduct that becomes suspicious when viewed in conjunction with the incriminating information received from the informant. <em>State v. Griggs, </em>2001 MT 211, \u00b6 50, 306 Mont. 366, \u00b6 50, 34 P.3d 101, \u00b6 50. In order to reveal this indicia of suspicious conduct, officers may investigate and corroborate otherwise innocent and non-criminal activity with further observations and evidence of otherwise innocent and non-criminal activity. <em>Griggs, </em>\u00b6 50. Here, the police flew over Zito\u2019s property and confirmed the informant\u2019s description of the suspect areas, including the yellow tarp and junk cars that obscured areas of the premises where the marijuana was said to be grown. The informant\u2019s statements describing planter boxes and pots, and their placement and location, were also confirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-7\">\u00b613 The flyover corroborated the reliability of the informant\u2019s information in two ways. First, it showed that he knew, in detail, the layout of Zito\u2019s property, which confirmed that he had been there as he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>had told Detective Basnaw. Second, it provided confirmation of information that, although innocent by itself, was consistent with a marijuana grow operation, when considered in conjunction with the prior tip that such activity was taking place there and the subsequent tip that there were over thirty marijuana plants located on Zito\u2019s property.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-4\">\u00b614 The fact that the confidential informant\u2019s tip that he had seen marijuana on Zito\u2019s property came after the flyover does not negate the corroborative value of this information. Information that over thirty marijuana plants were seen drying in the basement was entirely consistent with the earlier report made before the flyover that the plants were \u201cbudding and ready for harvest.\u201d Further, the fact that information in the earlier report was not based on personal observation, does not preclude a finding of reliability through independent corroboration. <em>See State v. Gray, </em>2001 MT 250, \u00b6\u00b6 4, 21, 307 Mont. 124, \u00b6\u00b6 4, 21, 38 P.3d 775, \u00b6\u00b6 4, 21 (innocent facts were sufficient to corroborate information from a confidential informant who had not personally observed any criminal activity).</p>\n<p id=\"b341-5\">\u00b615 Further, Detective Basnaw stated in his affidavit that he knew from training and experience that the strategic placement of the junk vehicles and tarps was indicative of secluding an area for illegal activity. A district court may consider the judgment and experience of a law enforcement officer in its determination of the significance of innocent facts and their consistency with the reported criminal activity. <em>Gray, \u00b6 </em>32 (citing <em>Gates, </em>462 U.S. at 231-232); <em>see also St. Marks, </em>\u00b6 36 (\u201cWe conclude we should lend credence to [investigating officer\u2019s] judgment. His experience and training provided a reasonable basis for his conclusions concerning [defendant\u2019s] behavior.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b341-6\">\u00b616 Another routine piece of information indicating police corroboration is criminal background checks. <em>Reesman, </em>\u00b6 45. Law enforcement investigated and found that Zito had a prior drug-related criminal conviction. This court has held that one\u2019s criminal history is \u201cone of the many factors to be considered under the totality of the circumstances test.\u201d <em>State v. Johnson </em>(1995), 271 Mont. 385, 390, 897 P.2d 1073, 1076-1077 (quoting <em>State v. Hook </em>(1992), 255 Mont. 2, 6, 839 P.2d 1274, 1277); <em>State v. Morse, </em>2006 MT 54, \u00b6 18, 331 Mont. 300, \u00b6 18, 132 P.3d 528, \u00b6 18; <em>State v. Anderson, </em>1999 MT 60, \u00b6\u00b6 12-14, 293 Mont. 490, \u00b6\u00b6 12-14, 977 P.2d 983, \u00b6\u00b6 12-14; <em>see also Gray, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 20-21 (criminal history of accomplice, involving dangerous drugs, supported corroboration and probable cause).</p>\n<p id=\"b341-7\">\u00b617 Finally, at least one concerned citizen had informed Detective <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>Basnaw that Zito was growing marijuana, albeit such information was not based on personal observation. While this tip from a concerned citizen would not be adequate to support probable cause without further investigation, it still had some probative value in determining probable cause, under the totality of the circumstances test. <em>St. Marks, </em>\u00b6 41; <em>see also State v. Holstine </em>(1993), 260 Mont. 310, 315, 860 P.2d 110, 113 (\u201cFactors which are of little probative value alone, however, when taken together under the <em>Gates </em>\u2018totality of the circumstances\u2019 test, provide the basis for a determination of substantial evidence to conclude probable cause existed to issue the search warrant.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b342-4\">\u00b618 The facts garnered from the flyover are indicia of human conduct that legitimately became suspicious to the issuing judicial officer when considered along with the personal observations of the informant, the drug-related criminal history of the property\u2019s occupant, the tip from a concerned citizen, and the opinion of a detective with substantial experience and training in dangerous drug related activities. <em>See Gray, </em>\u00b6 21 (innocent facts that defendant\u2019s home had four new air vents, which based on detective\u2019s experience were required for a grow operation; his utility records evidenced a surge in power usage; his alleged accomplice had a criminal history; and his brother, a known drug user, frequented the residence, were sufficient to corroborate information from a confidential informant who had not personally observed any criminal activity); <em>St. Marks, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 34-37 (\u201cindependent corroboration of [defendant\u2019s] motel room number, together with his method of payment [cash] and the fact that he had a local address, added to [his] suspicious character ... when taken as a whole with the ... three anonymous phone calls and [alleged partner\u2019s] arrest and possession of ... cocaine.\u201d); <em>see also Morse, </em>\u00b6 17 (innocent fact of possessing an empty digital scale box, considered in the context of the search warrant, sufficiently corroborated information from anonymous informants that defendant was selling drugs); <em>State v. Palmer, </em>2003 MT 129, \u00b6\u00b6 21-23, 316 Mont. 46, \u00b6\u00b6 21-23, 68 P.3d 809, \u00b6\u00b6 21-23 (video surveillance revealed no actual criminal activity, but when coupled with training and experience of narcotics officer, sufficiently corroborated incriminating information received from informant); <em>Hauge v. District Court, </em>2001 MT 255, \u00b6 25, 307 Mont. 195, \u00b6 25, 36 P.3d 947, \u00b6 25 (\u201cOfficer ... sufficiently corroborated the Cl\u2019s information by verifying the identities of the occupants of the trailers and the ownership of the vehicles; ... by personally observing the mobile homes on three separate occasions and finding the traffic patterns to be just as the Cl described; and by contacting a neighbor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>who had previously complained of drug activity and heavy traffic in the area and confirming that the traffic patterns still continued.\u201d).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"APD\">\u00b619  Considering the totality of the circumstances, we conclude that the District Court did not err in denying Zito\u2019s motion to suppress the evidence secured by execution of the search warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-4\">\u00b620 We next consider Zito\u2019s argument that all statements he made to law enforcement must be suppressed pursuant to \u00a7 46-6-107, MCA, <em>and Miranda v. Arizona </em>(1966), 384 U.S. 436, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694, which require that before being questioned, a person in custody must be advised that his statements may be used against him and that he has the right to consult with an attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-5\">\u00b621 Zito was not questioned by the first deputy who took him into custody or any other law enforcement officer when he was first apprehended. Then, moments after Zito had been taken into physical custody, Detective Basnaw identified himself to Zito and told him that the sheriffs office was executing a search warrant for a \u201cmarijuana grow operation.\u201d Zito responded with the gratuitous statement that he had a \u201cmedical grow.\u201d Detective Basnaw did not question Zito about this statement at that time, but only asked Zito if he had any weapons on his person. Zito responded that he had a back injury. He was then escorted to a police vehicle were he was read his <em>Miranda </em>rights and questioned by Detective Basnaw, who recorded the conversation. Zito contends that because his statement regarding the medical grow was made while he was in custody and prior to being Mirandized, the statement could not later be used to elicit further statements, after he had been given his rights.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b344-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>\u00b622  The <em>Miranda </em>warnings are not required to be given by law enforcement unless one is subject to a custodial interrogation. <em>State v. Reavley, </em>2003 MT 298, \u00b6 18, 318 Mont. 150, \u00b6 18, 79 P.3d 270, \u00b6 18; \u00a7 46-6-107, MCA. A custodial interrogation is defined as, \u201cquestioning initiated by law enforcement officers after a person has been taken into custody or otherwise deprived of his freedom of action in any significant way[.]\u201d <em>Reavley, </em>\u00b6 18 <em>(quoting Miranda, </em>384 U.S. at 444, 86 S.Ct. at 1612, 16 L.Ed.2d at 706). There is no dispute that Zito was in custody at the time he made the statement to Detective Basnaw that he had a \u201cmedical grow.\u201d However, the record is clear that Zito was not questioned by any law enforcement officer, or otherwise coerced or induced to make the statement in question. Since there was no interrogation, the statement does not fall under the auspices of <em>Miranda. See State v. Thompson </em>(1989), 237 Mont. 384, 387, 773 P.2d 722, 724; <em>State v. DePue </em>(1989), 237 Mont. 428, 430-432, 774 P.2d 386, 388-389. Because the initial statement was not elicited in violation of Zito\u2019s constitutional rights, we need not consider the argument that it somehow tainted subsequent statements. Thus, the District Court did not err in denying Zito\u2019s motion to suppress his statements.</p>\n<p id=\"ASW\">\u00b623 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b344-5\">JUSTICE COTTER, LEAPHART, MORRIS and RICE concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b339-8\"> The remainder of the search warrant application was excised by the reviewing District Court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b343-6\"> The present cases is unlike <em>Griggs, </em>where the \u201cinnocent facts\u201d corroborated by law enforcement were totally unrelated to the suspected criminal activity. In <em>Griggs, </em>the corroboration of the defendant\u2019s address, the fact that he used to be in the military, he drove a Ford truck, and that his trailer home had new trim, failed \u201cto supply the magistrate with any indicia of human conduct even remotely associated with the criminal activity alleged by the anonymous informant-that [defendant] was cultivating psilocybin mushrooms in his private residence for the purpose of distribution in some manner.\u201d <em>Griggs, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 7, 51. As discussed above, the corroborated facts relating to Zito were clearly pertinent to the harvesting of marijuana, and confirmed as such by an experienced narcotics detective.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b343-7\"> The relevant portion of the taped interview, in which Zito claims Basnaw elicited further information in violation of <em>Miranda, </em>immediately followed his <em>Miranda </em>warning, and reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-8\">Detective Basnaw:...

Gates </em>(1983), 462 U.S. 213, 238-39, 103 S.Ct. 2317, 2332 (\u201c[T]he duty of a reviewing court is simply to ensure that the magistrate had a \u2018substantial basis for ... concluding]\u2019 that probable cause existed.\u201d (ellipsis and second alteration in original)). However, the Court goes on to state, without qualification, that \u201cit is critical in our review that a judicial officer\u2019s determination that probable cause exists be paid great deference and every reasonable inference possible be drawn to support that determination.\u201d \u00b6 8 (citing <em>State v. Reesman, </em>2000 MT 243, \u00b6 19, 301 Mont. 408, \u00b6 19, 10 P.3d 83, \u00b6 19, and <em>Gates, </em>462 U.S. at 236, 103 S.Ct. at 2331). While I do not dispute this statement as a general standard guiding our review, it is essential to clarify that such deference is not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>boundless:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-4\">It is clear, first, that the deference accorded to a magistrate\u2019s finding of probable cause does not preclude inquiry into the knowing or reckless falsity of the affidavit on which that determination was based. Second, the courts must also insist that the magistrate purport to \u201cperform his \u2018neutral and detached\u2019 function and not serve merely as a rubber stamp for the police.\u201d A magistrate failing to \u201cmanifest that neutrality and detachment demanded of a judicial officer when presented with a warrant application\u201d and who acts instead as \u201can adjunct law enforcement officer\u201d cannot provide valid authorization for an otherwise unconstitutional search.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-5\">Third, reviewing courts will not defer to a warrant based on an affidavit that does not \u201cprovide the magistrate with a substantial basis for determining the existence of probable cause.\u201d \u201cSufficient information must be presented to the magistrate to allow that official to determine probable cause; his action cannot be a mere ratification of the bare conclusions of others.\u201d Even if the warrant application was supported by more than a \u201cbare bones\u201d affidavit, a reviewing court may properly conclude that, notwithstanding the deference that magistrates deserve, the warrant was invalid because the magistrate\u2019s probable-cause determination reflected an improper analysis of the totality of the circumstances, or because the form of the warrant was improper in some respect.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ass\"><em>United States v. Leon </em>(1984), 468 U.S. 897, 914-15, 104 S.Ct. 3405, 3416-17 (citations and footnotes omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b345-6\">\u00b626 Thus, we must <em>review </em>\u2014 and not simply defer to-the judicial officer\u2019s determination of probable cause. In the case at hand, we must determine whether Detective Basnaw provided the Ravalli County Justice Court with sufficient information to allow the reviewing judicial officer to determine probable cause and whether the judicial officer\u2019s probable-cause determination reflected a proper analysis of the totality of the circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-7\">\u00b627 With these principles in mind, the application for search warrant at issue here is not a model of clarity. As demonstrated by the District Court\u2019s distillation of the numerous statements in Detective Basnaw\u2019s application to a few salient probable cause facts, the application contains entirely too much irrelevant \u201cfiller,\u201d not to mention the copious conclusory, speculative, and unsupported assertions.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-8\">\u00b628 Nevertheless, the application involves a much closer call than did the search warrant application that this Court recently approved in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number><em>State v. Barnaby, </em>2006 MT 203, 333 Mont. 220, 142 P.3d 809, <em>see Barnaby, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 72-191 (Nelson, J., dissenting); and at least here-unlike in <em>Barnaby-there </em>was a reasonable attempt to apply the framework set forth in <em>Reesman. </em>Viewing Detective Basnaw\u2019s application under the totality-of-the-circumstances approach, I agree with the Court that the District Court properly interpreted and applied the law in concluding that the reviewing judicial officer had a substantial basis for determining that probable cause existed. <em>See Reesman, </em>\u00b6 18 (\u201c[T]he standard of review of a district court\u2019s denial of a motion to suppress is whether the court\u2019s interpretation and application of the law is correct.\u201d (citing <em>State v. Hubbel </em>(1997), 286 Mont. 200, 207, 951 P.2d 971, 975)). Accordingly, the District Court did not err in denying Zito\u2019s motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-4\">\u00b629 That said, Zito\u2019s having \u201ca prior drug-related criminal conviction\u201d five years earlier<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> is, in my view, of negligible value in assessing probable cause to issue a warrant to search his property. <em>See State v. Tackitt, </em>2003 MT 81, \u00b6 41, 315 Mont. 59, \u00b6 41, 67 P.3d 295, \u00b6 41. I therefore do not agree with the Court\u2019s reliance on this information in \u00b6 16.1 also do not agree with the Court\u2019s suggestion in \u00b6 11 that an applicant\u2019s bare assertion that he \u201ckn[ows] from experience that [an] informant would recognize marijuana\u201d (by sight? by smell?) is a sufficient basis on which to credit that informant\u2019s identification of something observed or smelled as marijuana. Some background information substantiating the applicant\u2019s knowledge of the informant\u2019s ability should be included. As it turns out, Detective Basnaw did include such background information, which the Court oddly has omitted from its Opinion: \u201cCl . . . admits to having used marijuana in the past.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b346-5\">\u00b630 Lastly, for the reasons set forth at length in my dissent in <em>Barnaby, see Barnaby, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 72-191 (Nelson, J., dissenting), I cannot join any part of today\u2019s Opinion that relies on that case. I am satisfied that the <em>Reesman </em>standards-or whatever is left of them-were met here. F or this reason only, and with the foregoing caveats, I concur.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b346-8\"> Detective Basnaw discloses in the application, dated October 22, 2003, that \u201cZito\u2019s criminal history shows that he was arrested in September of1997 and eventually convicted for criminal possession of dangerous drug paraphernalia.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b346-6\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY,</author>\n<p id=\"AIF\">specially concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-7\">\u00b631 I join in the substance of Justice Nelson\u2019s special concurrence insofar as it relates solely to this case.
