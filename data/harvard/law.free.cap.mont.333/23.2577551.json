The following events took place on the evening of May 2, 2002, and the early morning of May 3, 2002.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-17\">\u00b612 Between 4:00 p.m. and 5:00 p.m., Benjamin Nielsen (Ben) dropped off his wife, Wilma Nielsen (Wilma), in downtown Billings so that she could go see some friends. Around 7:00 p.m. or 7:15 p.m., Ben received a call from someone named Karen at the Empire Lounge telling him that he needed to pick up Wilma because she was intoxicated. Ben waited about twenty minutes, and then drove his van downtown to find Wilma.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-18\">\u00b613 At the Empire Lounge, Ben collected a bag of clothing Wilma had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>left for him, but he did not see her there. After twenty to thirty minutes of looking for her at several other bars, Ben returned at a little after 8:00 p.m. to the Empire Lounge and found Wilma standing outside with a man. They were drinking whiskey straight from the bottle. Ben, Wilma, and the other man went to the Rainbow Club, about a five minute walk from the Empire Lounge, and ordered more drinks.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-4\">\u00b614 After they finished their drinks, Ben was going to order another round when Wilma seemed to become upset about something and went to the bathroom. She stayed in the bathroom weeping for about ten minutes, after which the three companions left the bar and started walking back toward the Empire Lounge. They only went about thirty to forty feet before Wilma angrily told the other man to get away from her. Ben and Wilma argued about taking her home, but she said she was going to go partying. She stepped to the curb and stuck out her thumb. A van pulled up.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-5\">\u00b615 Wilma opened the side door of the van and got in, telling the driver that she wanted to go to the airport or bus station. Ben got in the front passenger seat, and they all introduced themselves. Ben told the driver, who was the Defendant, James English, that he needed to get Wilma home. English and Ben got out of the van, briefly went into the Rainbow Club, then came out again and got back into the van. Ben and Wilma argued about whether she should go home, and English said, \u201cI ain\u2019t got time for this ....\u201d English asked Ben to step out of the van, saying \u201cGo down and get your van and I\u2019ll help you get your wife home.\u201d Ben got out, leaving Wilma lying on a mattress in the back of the van. That was at about 8:45 p.m. The next time Ben would see his wife would be the following morning in the intensive care unit of the hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-6\">\u00b616 After exiting English\u2019s vehicle, Ben ran to get into his van to follow English and Wilma because he suspected that they might be going off to have sex. He drove for about two hours, went home for about forty-five minutes, and then searched for another two hours, but he did not find them.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-7\">\u00b617 About an hour after Ben parted company with Wilma and English, Toby and Brenda Kline were driving by their business located near the Reporter Office Products parking lot in an industrial area of Billings. They noticed a van parked in the lot at a strange angle with its wheels turned sharply to the left. A man, later identified as English, was standing outside the van looking down at someone, later identified as Wilma, lying on the ground. The Klines drove around the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>block once or twice to get a look at the scene, then parked about 125-135 yards away and watched the two strangers with binoculars. Wilma was lying on her back about ten to fourteen feet from the open side door of the van, not moving at all. Though English is a large man, he struggled to pull Wilma-who was quite large as well-toward the van, dragging her head on the ground and dropping her in the process. English ultimately succeeded in getting her to within two or three feet of the van.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-4\">\u00b618 As they observed this odd behavior, the Klines called 911; records indicate the time was 9:59 p.m. During and after the call to the police, the Klines saw English walk around and step over Wilma several times. He appeared to be talking to her. At one point, English walked to the driver side and got in the van, sat there for roughly twenty seconds, got back out, and resumed stepping over and walking around Wilma. Between four and six minutes after the Klines called 911, a police patrol car arrived at the scene, followed by other patrol cars and an ambulance.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-5\">\u00b619 Officers Steve Swanson and David Dierenfield were the first officers on the scene. After evaluating the situation, they directed English to sit on a parking block a short distance away from Wilma and the van. The officers repeatedly asked English what had happened to Wilma, but he refused to answer, saying that he knew what happened but was not involved. Officer Dierenfield then arrested English and put him in one of the patrol cars. When the police commander, Sergeant Thomas Vladic, arrived five to ten minutes later, he asked English what had happened to Wilma, but he said he would only talk if Sergeant Vladic would give him a cigarette, which the officer declined to do. At 3:52 a.m., almost six hours after English\u2019s arrest, the police conducted a blood alcohol test on him pursuant to a search warrant. His blood alcohol content at that time was .06.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-6\">\u00b620 Paramedic Eric Fisher performed the initial assessment of Wilma in the parking lot, noting that she had abrasions all over her body, had several broken ribs, and had a broken bone in her leg that was protruding through her skin. Wilma was taken to Deaconess Hospital, treated by a trauma team, and subsequently placed in the intensive care unit. She died nineteen days later of complications resulting from being run over by a motor vehicle. The autopsy revealed that Wilma had roughly twenty broken ribs, a fractured pelvis, and severe sepsis.</p>\n<p id=\"AWH\">\u00b621 English was charged with negligent homicide, a felony. A jury convicted English of the charge, and he was sentenced to twenty years imprisonment with ten years suspended. English appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b52-4\">\u00b622 Did the District Court abuse its discretion by denying the Defendant\u2019s motion for a directed verdict?</p>\n<p id=\"b52-5\">\u00b623 In <em>State v. DeWitt, </em>2004 MT 317, \u00b6 34, 324 Mont. 39, \u00b6 34, 101 P.3d 277, \u00b6 34 (citation omitted), we recited the standard of review for a denial of a motion for directed verdict:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b52-6\">We review a district court\u2019s denial of a motion for a directed verdict to determine whether the court abused its discretion. In doing so, we determine whether, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the elements of the offense beyond a reasonable doubt. Abuse of discretion occurs only when the district court acted arbitrarily without the employment of conscientious judgment or exceeded the bounds of reason resulting in substantial injustice.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AI\">\u00b624 Section 45-5-104(1), MCA, defines negligent homicide: \u201cA person commits the offense of negligent homicide if the person negligently causes the death of another human being.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b52-7\">\u00b625 Section 45-2-101(42), MCA (2001), defines the mental state \u201cnegligently\u201d as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b52-8\">\u201cNegligently\u201d-a person acts negligently with respect to a result or to a circumstance described by a statute defining an offense when the person consciously disregards a risk that the result will occur or that the circumstance exists or when the person disregards a risk of which the person should be aware that the result will occur or that the circumstance exists. The risk must be of a nature and degree that to disregard it involves a gross deviation from the standard of conduct that a reasonable person would observe in the actor\u2019s situation. \u201cGross deviation\u201d means a deviation that is considerably greater than lack of ordinary care.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AF\">\u00b626 English argues that the State failed to produce sufficient evidence to permit a jury to convict him. He focuses on the fact that the amended information charged him with negligently causing Wilma\u2019s death by driving and contends that the State inappropriately expanded its theory at trial to allege he was negligent \u2018\u201cbefore, during and after\u2019 the incident where Wilma was struck by the van.\u201d According to English, the only possibly relevant negligence was in the actual driving of the van, so he directs our attention to the State\u2019s own accident reconstruction expert, Dr. John Jurist. English states that Dr. Jurist testified that English \u201cmost likely would not have perceived the collision until after the collision happened\u201d and that \u201cit was most likely the defendant could not see Wilma prior to hitting her with his van.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>English further asserts that the State established no causal link between his alcohol consumption and the van\u2019s impact with Wilma because, according to Dr. Jurist\u2019s testimony, English could not see Wilma before the van hit her, making impaired reaction time or judgment irrelevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-4\">\u00b627 English misrepresents Dr. Jurist\u2019s testimony. Dr. Jurist explained that, <em>given certain </em>assumptions-i.e., that Wilma was within twenty-eight to thirty-three inches of the vehicle, that the driver was of a particular height, that Wilma was lying prone on the ground, and that Wilma\u2019s body reached sixteen to nineteen inches of height when in that position-the driver may not have been able to see Wilma before running over her. However, Dr. Jurist makes it clear in other parts of his testimony that it may have been possible for English to see Wilma before impact because it was not known how far away Wilma was from the van when it began moving toward her. Whether English did in fact see Wilma before driving over her was not part of Dr. Jurist\u2019s testimony. Rather, this was a question of fact left to the jury to determine.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-5\">\u00b628 In addition, the evidence showing that Wilma was last seen as a passenger in English\u2019s van, that she was intoxicated but uninjured at the time she was last seen, and that her injuries were caused by being run over by English\u2019s vehicle is sufficient to permit a rational jury to infer that Enghsh neghgently caused Wilma\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-6\">\u00b629  Accordingly, Enghsh has failed to establish that no rational trier of fact could have found the elements of the offense beyond a reasonable doubt, nor has he demonstrated that the District Court acted arbitrarily or exceeded the bounds of reason. Therefore, we conclude that the District Court did not abuse its discretion by denying English\u2019s motion for a directed verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-7\">\u00b630 Did the District Court abuse its discretion by admitting the results of the Defendant\u2019s blood alcohol test?</p>\n<p id=\"b53-8\">\u00b631 In <em>State v. Larson, </em>2004 MT 345, \u00b6 29, 324 Mont. 310, \u00b6 29, 103 P.3d 524, \u00b6 29 (internal quotation marks and citations omitted), we recited the standard of review for evidentiary rulings:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b53-9\">Issues concerning the admissibility of evidence are within the discretion of the district court. The trial court is vested with great latitude in ruling on the admissibility of expert testimony. A district court has broad discretion to determine whether evidence is relevant and admissible, and absent an abuse of discretion, this Court will not overturn that court\u2019s ruling. The test for abuse of discretion is whether the trial court acted arbitrarily without <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>employment of conscientious judgment or exceeded the bounds of reason resulting in substantial injustice.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b54-4\">\u00b632 English submitted a motion <em>in limine </em>to exclude the admission of evidence regarding his blood alcohol test. The District Court denied the motion in part because the State assured the court that it would present evidence linking English\u2019s impaired state to his negligent conduct. At trial, the State presented evidence regarding the alcohol test, English\u2019s probable alcohol impairment at the time that he ran over Wilma, and the effect that impairment would have had on his driving.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-5\">\u00b633 English argues on appeal that admitting the blood alcohol evidence was an abuse of discretion because there was no causal connection between English\u2019s impaired state and his alleged negligence. Moreover, English contends that the admission of the evidence was highly prejudicial. In support of his argument, English cites <em>Havens v. State </em>(1997), 285 Mont. 195, 945 P.2d 941, a civil case in which this Court held that, in the absence of evidence connecting the traffic accident at issue with the plaintiff\u2019s alcohol consumption, the trial court erred in failing to grant a motion for a new trial because evidence of the plaintiffs alcohol consumption was irrelevant, prejudicial, and likely to confuse the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-6\">\u00b634 English\u2019s reliance on <em>Havens </em>is misplaced. In <em>Havens, </em>the State\u2019s own expert testified that the plaintiff was not negligent, and other evidence was presented that Havens could not have avoided the accident. <em>Havens, </em>285 Mont. at 198, 945 P.2d at 942. Thus, the presence of alcohol in Havens\u2019 blood was irrelevant absent a causal connection to the accident. <em>Havens, </em>285 Mont. at 200, 945 P.2d at 944.</p>\n<p id=\"A_4\">\u00b635  The present case is distinguishable. Here, the State presented evidence from Dr. Jurist that English may have been able to see Wilma before running over her. Likewise, the State presented evidence that English\u2019s driving abilities were likely impaired by the alcohol content of his blood. Given the circumstances, the evidence of his impaired mental state was a relevant factor for the jury to consider in determining English\u2019s negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-7\">\u00b636 We came to a similar conclusion in <em>State v. Davis, </em>2000 MT 199, 300 Mont. 458, 5 P.3d 547. In <em>Davis, </em>there was evidence that the defendant, Davis, had consumed at least five brandies and four beers in few hours prior to getting in his Jeep to drive home. While driving home, Davis struck a woman with his car as she walked on the side of the road, killing her. Though the police did not arrest the defendant until the next day-making blood alcohol tests useless-we concluded <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>that the</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b55-4\">jury could reasonably have found from the evidence presented that Davis consciously disregarded the risk posed by his driving under the influence of alcohol, and that his conduct immediately before, during, and after the accident reveals a gross deviation from the standard of conduct that a reasonable person, not under the influence of alcohol, would have observed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b55-5\"><em>Davis, </em>\u00b6 33.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-6\">\u00b637  Therefore, we conclude that the District Court did not act arbitrarily or exceed the bounds of reason, and thus it did not abuse its discretion by admitting the blood alcohol evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-7\">\u00b638 Was the intoxication instruction given to the jury an incorrect statement of the law and reversible error?</p>\n<p id=\"b55-8\">\u00b639 We stated the applicable standard of review for jury instructions in <em>State v. Pittman, </em>2005 MT 70, \u00b6 30, 326 Mont. 324, \u00b6 30, 109 P.3d 237, \u00b6 30:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b55-9\">We review jury instructions to determine whether the instructions as a whole fully and fairly instruct the jury on the applicable law. A district court has broad discretion in formulating jury instructions, and our standard of review is whether the court abused that discretion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b55-10\">\u00b640 Jury Instruction Number 7 reads as follows: \u201cIntoxication is not an essential element of negligent homicide. Intoxication is merely one of the factors to be considered in determining whether the death of Wilma Nielsen was caused by the negligent actions of James English.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AS\">\u00b641 English argues that this instruction, particularly the last phrase \u201cnegligent actions of James English,\u201d directs the jury to assume he was negligent. As a result, English maintains that the instruction was an incorrect statement of the law and was \u201cextremely prejudicial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b55-11\">\u00b642 We disagree and conclude that the jury instruction was a correct statement of the law. Intoxication is not an element of negligent homicide under the applicable law. Sections 45-5-104(1), MCA, 45-2-101(42), MCA (2001); <em>see State v. Arrington </em>(1993), 260 Mont. 1, 11, 858 P.2d 343, 349; <em>but cf. Larson, </em>\u00b6 46 (\u201ccriminal negligence can arise as a result of intoxication\u201d). Moreover, in the context of the other instructions, Instruction Number 7 does not direct the jury to assume English was negligent. Indeed, Instruction Number 6 states quite clearly that one of the two elements the jury must find in order to convict is that \u201cthe Defendant acted negligently.\u201d Instruction Number 8 goes on to define the term \u201cnegligently\u201d without reference to intoxication. Given Instructions 6 and 8, it appears that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>proper-and natural-reading of Instruction Number 7 is that the conjunction \u201cwhether\u201d introduces an indirect question asking the jury to determine that English either acted negligently or did not act negligently. The purpose of the preceding clause was to explain that intoxication alone is not determinative on this point.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-4\">\u00b643  Consequently, we hold that the District Court did not abuse its discretion in giving the jury the intoxication instruction and that the instruction was a correct statement of the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-5\">\u00b644 Did the District Court abuse its discretion by admitting statements made by the victim?</p>\n<p id=\"b56-6\">\u00b645 Once more, we review evidentiary rulings for abuse of discretion. <em>See </em>\u00b6 31.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-7\">\u00b646 English contends that the District Court erred by admitting several statements that Wilma made to medical personnel. He argues that the District Court incorrectly admitted the statements pursuant to Rules 803(2) (excited utterance) and 803(4) (medical diagnosis), M.R.Evid.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-8\">\u00b647 However, the District Court admitted the statements on other grounds as well-namely, Rule 803(1) (present sense impression), Rule 803(3) (mental or physical condition), and Rule 804(b)(5) (circumstantial guarantees of trustworthiness), M.R.Evid. Because English offers no argument regarding the additional bases for the District Court\u2019s admission of these statements, we cannot conclude that the District Court acted arbitrarily or beyond the bounds of reason, and we need not decide whether the court erred by admitting the statements pursuant to Rules 803(2) and 803(4). Failure to challenge each of the alternative bases for a district court\u2019s ruling results in affirmance. <em>See Skinner v. Allstate Ins. Co., </em>2005 MT 323, \u00b6 9, 329 Mont. 511, \u00b6 9, 127 P.3d 359, \u00b6 9 (failure to argue results in abandonment of issue); Rule 23(a)(4), M.R.App.P. (appellant must present arguments).</p>\n<p id=\"b56-9\">\u00b648  Thus, we hold that the District Court did not abuse its discretion in admitting Wilma\u2019s statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-10\">\u00b649 Did the District Court abuse its discretion by admitting photographs of the victim?</p>\n<p id=\"b56-11\">\u00b650 In <em>State v. Dunfee, </em>2005 MT 147, \u00b6 26, 327 Mont. 335, \u00b6 26, 114 P.3d 217, \u00b6 26 (citations omitted), we addressed the standard for reviewing the admission of photographs:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b56-12\">A district court\u2019s decision regarding the admissibility of evidence should not be set aside unless there is an abuse of discretion. In considering whether photographs should be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>admitted, a district court must determine whether the probative value of the photos outweighs any prejudicial effect. This Court has consistently held that photographs possessing instructive value are relevant and admissible provided their probative value is not substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Att\">\u201cThe test for abuse of discretion is whether the trial court acted arbitrarily or exceeded the bounds of reason resulting in substantial injustice.\u201d <em>State v. Kearney, </em>2005 MT 171, \u00b6 12, 327 Mont. 485, \u00b6 12, 115 P.3d 214, \u00b6 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-4\">\u00b651 English argues that certain photographs taken of Wilma in the emergency room were improperly admitted because they were inflammatory, irrelevant to the question of English\u2019s negligence, and far more prejudicial than probative. In support of his argument, English cites <em>State v. Bristow </em>(1994), 267 Mont. 170, 882 P.2d 1041, in which this Court held that, where bodily injury was not in dispute, four enlarged color photographs showing the victim\u2019s severe injuries were of little or no probative value in establishing accountability for an aggravated kidnapping. English contends that the instant case is analogous to the situation in <em>Bristow, </em>arguing that Wilma\u2019s death was not in dispute here.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-5\">\u00b652  We disagree and hold that the photographs were relevant to show the type of injury and to aid in understanding trial testimony. Although Wilma\u2019s death was not in dispute, her particular injuries, as documented in the photographs at issue here, may have been useful to the jury in understanding the manner by which Wilma was injured, and when considered in light of the bizarre circumstances of the case-including English\u2019s odd behavior in the Reporter Office Products parking lot-they may have enabled the jury to make inferences about English\u2019s intent and state of mind when he drove the vehicle over Wilma. Thus, the visual evidence of the injuries to Wilma was relevant because the type of injuries she sustained could have been a factor in determining English\u2019s negligence. <em>See State v. Mergenthaler </em>(1994), 263 Mont. 198, 205, 868 P.2d 560, 564 (\u201cPhotographs are admissible for the purpose of explaining and applying the evidence and for assisting the court and the jury in understanding the case.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b57-6\">\u00b653  Therefore, we conclude that the District Court\u2019s decision did not result in substantial injustice and, accordingly, that the District Court did not abuse its discretion by admitting the photographs.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-7\">\u00b654 Did the District Court penalize the Defendant for taking his case to trial, thereby violating his due process rights?</p>\n<p id=\"b57-8\">\u00b655 \u201cThis Court reviews a district court\u2019s sentence for legality only, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>confining its review to whether the sentence falls within the parameters set by statute.\u201d <em>Dunfee, </em>\u00b6 46. Section 45-5-104(3), MCA, sets the maximum penalty for negligent homicide at twenty years in prison and a $50,000 fine.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-4\">\u00b656 English, relying on <em>State v. Baldwin </em>(1981), 192 Mont. 521, 629 P.2d 222, and <em>State v. Tate </em>(1982), 196 Mont. 248, 639 P.2d 1149, contends that in sentencing him to twenty years imprisonment with ten years suspended the District Court imposed a \u201ctrial tax\u201d on him for taking his case to trial instead of pleading guilty. English directs our attention to comments the trial judge made at the sentencing hearing, and he contends that the \u201cdistrict court\u2019s comments, especially in view of the disparity between sentences in the cases reviewed by the district court-cases the district court specifically noted the defendants had pled guilty or nolo contendere-establish a clear due process violation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AK\">\u00b657 English\u2019s argument is unpersuasive. The District Court focused on the aggravating circumstances in English\u2019s case-i.e., the influence of alcohol on both English and Wilma, English\u2019s statements in the presentence investigation report, the violence involved, and English\u2019s failure to call for help-not on the sentences imposed in prior negligent homicide cases. The District Court\u2019s review of sentences in prior negligent homicide cases was at the prompting of the parties and in compliance with \u00a7 46-18-101(3)(b), MCA, requiring sentences to be commensurate with the punishment imposed on others committing the same crime. There is no indication from the record that the District Court imposed a \u201ctrial tax\u201d on the defendant for proceeding to trial. To the contrary, the District Court merely acknowledged that there is a distinction between sentences imposed on those who plead guilty or <em>nolo contendere </em>and on those who plead not guilty but are convicted by a jury. Specifically, the District Court stated the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b58-5\">I have reviewed all of the Yellowstone County cases from-for negligent homicide from 1995, actually 1994 to the present.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b58-6\">[T]he one constant that I have found in all of them is that every defendant pled guilty. One of them I believe entered a nolo contendere plea. The defense labels the State and the PSI [presentence investigation] author as imposing a trial tax. The sentence I impose is not imposed because Mr. English chose to exercise his right to go to trial, but there is a distinction with one pleading guilty before trial, admitting responsibility and someone after the fact expressing remorse and foxhole religion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b58-7\">The District Court\u2019s assessment is correct. <em>See Baldwin, </em>192 Mont. at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>525, 629 P.2d at 225 (\u201cA policy of leniency following a plea is proper ....\u201d); <em>cf. State v. Allen </em>(1996), 278 Mont. 326, 335, 925 P.2d 470, 475 (\u201ca mere disparity between the sentence offered during plea bargaining and that ultimately imposed is not, of itself, improper\u201d) (citing Baldwin, 629 P.2d at 225).</p>\n<p id=\"b59-4\">\u00b658 In <em>Baldwin, </em>the trial judge was involved in the plea bargaining process, offering a lenient sentence of forty-five days of jail time if the defendant pled guilty. However, the defendant chose to enter a plea of not guilty and to proceed to trial. He was convicted and subsequently sentenced to ten years in prison. We held in that case that <em>\u201ca </em>sentencing court which becomes involved in the plea bargaining process, and which imposes a harsher sentence after trial than was offered in exchange for a guilty plea, must specifically point out the factors thatjustify the increased sentence.\u201d Baldwin, 192 Mont. at 527-28, 629 P.2d at 226. Because there was no indication in the record explaining the disparity, we vacated the sentence and remanded the cause for resentencing. Our decision in Taie-which involved similar circumstances-mer ely vacated the defendant\u2019s sentence and remanded the cause for resentencing in conformity with <em>Baldwin. Tate, </em>196 Mont. at 250-51, 639 P.2d at 1150.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-5\">\u00b659  As noted, at issue in <em>Baldwin </em>was the disparity between the sentence offered in the plea bargaining process and the final sentence imposed after trial and conviction. In the instant case, the District Court was not involved in any plea bargaining process at all, and English acknowledges as much. However, English cites <em>Baldwin </em>and its successor, <em>Tate, </em>as support for his argument that the disparity between <em>his </em>sentence and the sentence imposed on <em>others </em>who committed the same crime-but who pled guilty or <em>nolo </em>contendere-amounts to a due process violation. We discern no indispensable logical connection between the holding in <em>Baldwin </em>and the proposition that English sets forth here. In fact, <em>Baldwin </em>supports the contrary idea that there may be appropriate differences between sentences imposed upon defendants who have pled guilty and those that have proceeded to trial. <em>See </em>\u00b6 57. Therefore, we conclude that the twenty-year sentence (ten suspended) imposed by the District Court was within the statutory parameters and did not violate English\u2019s due process rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-6\">\u00b660 Did the District Court err in ruling that the homicide was a crime of violence and thereby failing to consider sentencing alternatives to prison?</p>\n<p id=\"b59-7\">\u00b661 \u201cThe interpretation of a statute is a question of law that we review <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>to determine whether the interpretation is correct.\u201d <em>State v. Allum, </em>2005 MT 150, \u00b6 14, 327 Mont. 363, \u00b6 14, 114 P.3d 233, \u00b6 14. Moreover,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AWc\">in construing statutes, the function of the court is simply to ascertain and declare what is in terms or in substance contained therein, not to insert what has been omitted or to omit what has been inserted. Where the plain language of the statute is clear and unambiguous, no further interpretation is required.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b60-4\"><em>State v. Kroll, </em>2004 MT 203, \u00b6 17, 322 Mont. 294, \u00b6 17, 95 P.3d 717, \u00b6 17 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b60-5\">\u00b662 Section 46-18-104(2)(a)(ii), MCA, states that unless the context requires otherwise, \u201ca crime in which the offender causes serious bodily injury or death to a person other than the offender\u201d is a crime of violence. Section 46-18-101(f), MCA (2001), states, \u201cSentencing practices must provide alternatives to imprisonment for the punishment of those nonviolent felony offenders who do not have serious criminal records.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b60-6\">\u00b663 English argues that the homicide he committed was not a crime of violence, and, further, that to literally interpret \u00a7 46-18-104(2)(a)(ii), MCA, to include negligent homicide as a crime of violence leads to absurd results. Thus, he contends that, pursuant to \u00a7 46-18-101(0, MCA, he was entitled to have the District Court consider alternatives to imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-7\">\u00b664  English\u2019s argument is unpersuasive. He caused Wilma Nielsen\u2019s death through his negligence. Section 46-18-104(2)(a)(ii), MCA, is clear, and the District Court correctly interpreted it. Additionally, we do not perceive that the literal application of the statute leads to any \u201cabsurd results\u201d in the present circumstances. Therefore, we conclude the District Court did not err in ruling that the homicide was a crime of violence or by failing to consider sentencing alternatives to prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-8\">\u00b665 Should this Court exercise plain error review to examine whether comments made at trial regarding the Defendant\u2019s silence violated his Fifth Amendment and state constitutional rights?</p>\n<p id=\"b60-9\">\u00b666 We articulated the standards for applying plain error review in <em>State v. Finley </em>(1996), 276 Mont. 126, 137-38, 915 P.2d 208, 215, <em>overruled on other grounds by State v. Gallagher, </em>2001 MT 39, 304 Mont. 215, 19 P.3d 817:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b60-10\">[Tjhis Court may discretionarily review claimed errors that implicate a criminal defendant\u2019s fundamental constitutional rights, even if no contemporaneous objection is made ... where <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>failing to review the claimed error at issue may result in a manifest miscarriage of justice, may leave unsettled the question of the fundamental fairness of the trial or proceedings, or may compromise the integrity of the judicial process.... [W]e will henceforth use our inherent power of common law plain error review sparingly, on a case-by-case basis ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b61-4\">\u00b667 English contends that the District Court committed plain error by admitting the testimony of several officers and paramedic Fisher. The admission of this testimony, English argues, violated his right to remain silent guaranteed by the Fifth Amendment and Article II, Section 25 of the Montana Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-5\">\u00b668 At the outset, English concedes that his trial counsel failed to object to the testimony or to request a mistrial. In addition, though it is not entirely clear which specific portions of testimony English now finds objectionable, it appears that at least one of the claimed inappropriate references to English\u2019s silence was elicited by his own attorney on cross-examination. Nevertheless, he calls the admission of the testimony \u201cegregious\u201d and \u201cplain error.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b61-6\">\u00b669 English does clearly direct our attention to two portions of testimony, which he labels as the \u201cmost offensive\u201d to him. One occurred during Officer Swanson\u2019s testimony, the first police officer called as a witness in the trial:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b61-7\">Q. [by the State] What did you ask the defendant about whether he wanted a lawyer?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b61-8\">A. [by Officer Swanson] I never did ask the defendant if he wanted a lawyer. I really didn\u2019t question him that much at all.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b61-9\">Q. What information did he provide you regarding whether he wanted a lawyer?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b61-10\">A. I had never heard the defendant ask for a lawyer. First I had heard was Sergeant Vladic had told me that he had, what we say, lawyered up, he requested a lawyer.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b61-11\">The second \u201cmost offensive\u201d piece of testimony came during redirect examination of the next witness, Officer Dierenfield:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b61-12\">Q. [by the State] Now, you testified on cross-examination that it\u2019s very rare that someone doesn\u2019t tell you what happened if it was an accident.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b61-13\">A. [by Officer Dierenfield] In my experience, the only time they don\u2019t want to tell me something is when they\u2019re hiding something. Accidents, they\u2019re drunk, they\u2019re DUI, they don\u2019t want to talk to me, they don\u2019t want me to smell their alcohol. Give a gazillion examples, but I would say very, very, very rare that they just say <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>I\u2019m not going to tell you what happened, very, very rare. They\u2019ll tell you something, whether or not it\u2019s the truth or if it\u2019s false, they\u2019ll tell you something usually. To just tell you absolutely nothing, extremely rare.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b62-4\">Officer Dierenfield went on to testify that he did not hear English request a lawyer.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-5\">\u00b670 After Officer Dierenfield completed his testimony, the parties had an in-chambers discussion with the judge. During that meeting, English\u2019s counsel, alluding to the witness\u2019 references to whether English had requested a lawyer, said the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b62-6\">We are simply saying that we do believe it\u2019s impermissible comment, and we would ask that the prosecution refrain from illiciting [sic] any further testimony about whether he is hiding something, whether he has requested an attorney. Because at some point, I think that we will move for a mistrial if there\u2019s further comment on the exercise of his constitutional rights.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b62-7\">The District Court responded, \u201cI\u2019m not being asked to rule on any motions now.\u201d English\u2019s counsel said, \u201cAbsolutely not.\u201d No motion for mistrial was ever made.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-8\">\u00b671 What is clear from the above exchanges is that English\u2019s counsel consciously chose not to object to the \u201coffensive\u201d testimony or to move for a mistrial on the grounds that the defendant\u2019s right to remain silent was offended by the officers\u2019 testimony. Together with the principle that we invoke plain error doctrine sparingly, <em>Finley, </em>276 Mont. at 138, 915 P.2d at 215, we have repeatedly emphasized the need for counsel to make contemporaneous objections at trial. <em>State v. Sullivan </em>(1996), 280 Mont. 25, 33, 927 P.2d 1033, 1038; <em>Finley, </em>276 Mont. at 138, 915 P.2d at 215. In addition, we have said that we will not overturn a district court for an error it did not have the opportunity to address:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b62-9\">It has long been the rule of this Court that on appeal we will not put a District Court in error for a ruling or procedure in which the appellant acquiesced, participated, or to which appellant made no objection. Acquiescence in error takes away the right of objecting to it. This Court will not hold a district court in error when it has not been given an opportunity to correct itself.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b62-10\"><em>State v. Gardner, </em>2003 MT 338, \u00b6 44, 318 Mont. 436, \u00b6 44, 80 P.3d 1262, \u00b6 44 (internal citations and quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b62-11\">\u00b672 Without further elucidation from English about how the admission of the less offensive testimony was plainly erroneous, or even about which pieces of testimony English places in this category, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>we cannot conclude that a manifest miscarriage of justice has occurred. As for the two \u201cmost offensive\u201d pieces of testimony, it is not plain or obvious that they constitute an affront to English\u2019s constitutional rights, or if they do, that they produced a miscarriage of justice or left unsettled the fairness of the trial. Indeed, English discusses at great length the law regarding the right to remain silent, but he does not clarify how the testimony was instrumental to the State\u2019s case or how it sullied the entire trial. English\u2019s raw assertion on appeal that the offensive testimony \u201cpervaded the entire trial\u201d is left ultimately undeveloped, leaving us to wonder why, if the assertion is true, his trial counsel did not move for a mistrial or otherwise object to the testimony, especially when counsel had raised that very prospect to the trial judge. It is entirely possible that the absence of such action by his counsel was the result of purposeful trial strategy or tactic. Either way, the question betrays the assertion and suggests that if there was an error here, it was certainly not plain. See <em>State v. Godfrey, </em>2004 MT 197, \u00b6 38, 322 Mont. 254, \u00b6 38, 95 P.3d 166, \u00b6 38 (\u201cA fundamental aspect of \u2018plain error,\u2019 is that the alleged error indeed must be \u2018plain.\u2019 \u201d). Accordingly, we decline to invoke the plain error doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-4\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b63-5\">\u00b673 For the foregoing reasons, the judgment and sentence of the District Court are affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b63-6\">JUSTICES WARNER, COTTER, LEAPHART and MORRIS concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b63-7\">JUSTICE NELSON</author>\n<p id=\"Au\">dissents.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-8\">\u00b674 I dissent from the Court\u2019s decision on Issue 3-the jury instruction issue-and would reverse and remand for a new trial. Therefore, I do not reach the Court\u2019s analysis or resolution of any of the other issues in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-9\">\n<em>Instruction Issue-Issue No. 3</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AR\">\u00b675 The instruction at issue, No. 7, states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b63-10\">Intoxication is not an essential element of negligent homicide. Intoxication is merely one of the factors to be considered in determining whether the death of Wilma Nielsen was caused by the negligent actions of James English.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b63-11\">This instruction, as noted by the Court at \u00b6 42, was given in conjunction with Instructions 6 and 8. Instruction 6 requires the jury to find that English \u201cacted negligently\u201d in causing the death of Wilma Nielsen if it is to find him guilty of negligent homicide.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-12\">\u00b676 Instruction 8 defines the term \u201cnegligently\u201d as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b64-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>A person acts negligently with respect to a result or to a circumstance described by a statute defining an offense when the person consciously disregards a risk that the result will occur or that the circumstance exists or when the person disregards a risk of which the person should be aware that the result will occur or that the circumstance exists. The risk must be of a nature and degree that to disregard it involves a gross deviation from the standard of conduct that a reasonable person would observe in the actor\u2019s situation. \u201cGross deviation\u201d means a deviation that is considerably greater than lack of ordinary care. Relevant terms, such as \u201cnegligent\u201d and \u201cwith negligence\u201d, have the same meaning.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b64-4\">\u00b677 The jury\u2019s charge in this case was to determine if English (a) caused Wilma Nielsen\u2019s death and, if yes, (b) whether he did so \u201cnegligently\u201d and, if yes, (c) whether his conduct disregarded a risk in light of the circumstances and, if yes, (d) whether that risk constituted a \u201cgross deviation\u201d from the reasonable or ordinary standard of care. In other words, in order to convict English of negligent homicide under the law of this case, the jury had to make four independent, but coordinate, factual determinations: (a) and (b) (from Instruction 6) and (c) and (d) (from Instruction 8). If the jury reached a negative answer on any one of these four determinations, then it was obligated to find English not guilty (see Instruction 6).</p>\n<p id=\"b64-5\">\u00b678 However, here, the court took from the jury the necessity to make three out of four of those factual determinations. With Instruction 7, the court pre-determined for the jury that English\u2019s actions were negligent. Contrary to the Court\u2019s statement in \u00b6 42, the use of \u201cwhether\u201d in the context of the passive voice phrase, refers only to \u201cwhether\u201d English caused Wilma Nielsen\u2019s death; having answered \u201cyes\u201d to that question, the next question is answered for the jury by the court-the cause was the \u201cnegligent actions\u201d of English. The jury did not have to determine <em>whether </em>English\u2019s actions <em>were </em>negligent; the court told the jury they <em>were-\u201cthe negligent actions\u201d </em>of English.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-6\">\u00b679 The court could have used the word \u201cconduct\u201d in place of \u201cnegligent actions,\u201d thereby leaving it to the fact-finder to determine whether such conduct was, as a matter of fact, \u201cnegligent\u201d under the law. Rather, the court chose to characterize that conduct as negligent in Instruction 7-i.e., it chose to use language in that instruction that told the jury what its decision was supposed to be on the very elemental fact that the jury, itself, was charged with deciding under Instructions 6 and 8. Thus, the court\u2019s faulty Instruction 7 obviated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>any need for the jury to make determinations on the material elements of the charge filed against English-i.e., (b), (c) and (d) referred to in \u00b6 77 above.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-4\">\u00b680 As such, Instructions 6, 7, and 8 were hopelessly confusing and internally inconsistent. While instructions are to be read as a whole, it is also a well-established and long-standing rule of Montana law that giving conflicting instructions upon a material issue is reversible error. <em>Bohrer v. Clark </em>(1979), 180 Mont. 233, 246, 590 P.2d 117, 124 (citing <em>Skeleton v. Great Northern Ry. Co. </em>(1940), 110 Mont. 257, 100 P.2d 929).</p>\n<p id=\"b65-5\">\u00b681 English did not get a fair trial because of the trial court\u2019s internally inconsistent jury instructions on the material elements of the charge. The court abused its discretion by not fairly instructing the jury on the applicable law.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-6\">\u00b682 I would reverse and remand for a new trial. I dissent from our failure to do so.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b65-7\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY,</author>\n<p id=\"Arn\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-8\">\u00b683 I, too, respectfully dissent from the Court\u2019s determination on the jury instruction issue. Consequently, I would reverse and remand for a new trial and not reach the other issues raised in this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-9\">\u00b684 My rationale with regard to the instructional error is more direct than Justice Nelson\u2019s. Reading Instructions 6 through 8 together, I conclude that the error in Instruction 7 is the inclusion of the word \u201cthe\u201d in front of the words \u201cnegligent actions.\u201d That one small word, in my view, constitutes sufficient prejudice to entitle English to a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-10\">\u00b685 As the Court discusses, Instruction 6 advises the jury that a necessary element of the offense is that the defendant acted negligently. Instruction 8 defines \u201cnegligently.\u201d Instruction 7 advises that intoxication is not a necessary element of the offense of negligent homicide, but can be considered by the jury. Had Instruction 7 said \u201c[ijntoxication is a factor to be considered in determining whether the death of Wilma Nielsen was caused by negligent actions of James English[,]\u201d followed by Instruction 8, defining negligently, the instructions would not have been erroneous. While I agree with the Court that the instructions-taken as a whole-did not expressly direct the jury to assume English was negligent, it is my view that Instruction 6 at least likely caused substantial confusion to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"AL\">\u00b686 I would reverse on the instruction issue and remand for a new trial on the negligent homicide offense. I dissent from the Court\u2019s failure to do so.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
