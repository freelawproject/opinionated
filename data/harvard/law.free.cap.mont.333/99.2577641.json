Their stipulation asks us to remand this case to the Eighteenth Judicial District Court \u201cwith instructions to dismiss the case with prejudice[.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b123-14\">\u00b62 Rule 36, M.R.App.P., allows for the voluntary dismissal of an appeal upon stipulation of the parties. Neither Rule 36 nor any other rule of appellate procedure contemplates this Court\u2019s remand of a case, upon the parties\u2019 stipulation, with instructions for the trial court to dismiss, as was requested here, or with instructions for the trial court to approve the parties\u2019 stipulation, as we sometimes have been asked to do in the past. <em>See, e.g., Peterson v. Montana Schools Group Insurance Authority, </em>Cause No. DA 06-0363 <em>dismissal order </em>(July 26, 2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b123-15\">\u00b63 We have, in the past, remanded cases upon stipulation of the parties for the trial court\u2019s consideration of whether to approve a settlement agreement. We will continue to do so. The stipulation presently before us, however, appears to condition our dismissal upon a remand to the District Court with instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-16\">\u00b64 THEREFORE, IT IS ORDERED that the stipulation for dismissal is DENIED, without prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-17\">The Clerk is directed to mail true copies of this order to all counsel of record.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-18\">DATED this 9th day of August, 2006.</p>\n<judges id=\"b123-19\">/s/ Karla M.
