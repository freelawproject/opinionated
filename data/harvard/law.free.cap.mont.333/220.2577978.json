Officer Louis Fiddler (Officer Fiddler), a Flathead Tribal Police Narcotics Investigator, applied for a warrant to search Barnaby\u2019s residence on February 11, 2002.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-5\">\u00b67 The application for a warrant begins with information pertaining to Sheridan\u2019s knowledge of how to manufacture methamphetamines. A confidential informant reported in February of 2000 that he and Corey Minez (Minez) had been taught to make methamphetamines by Ferren Galpin (Galpin). The police arrested Minez for the production of methamphetamines on March 10,2000. Minez confessed that he had been taught how to manufacture methamphetamines by Galpin and informed the police that Galpin also had taught Sheridan how to produce methamphetamines.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-6\">\u00b68 A concerned citizen contacted investigators \u201cin reference\u201d to Sheridan manufacturing methamphetamines in July of 2000. The warrant application uses the terms \u201cconcerned citizen\u201d and \u201ccitizen informant\u201d interchangeably. We, too, use the terms interchangeably for the purposes of this opinion. The citizen reported from first-hand knowledge and personal observations that Galpin had taught Sheridan how to produce methamphetamines. The application stated that Galpin is now serving a lengthy sentence after being convicted for the production of methamphetamines.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-7\">\u00b69 The application contains several reports that detail Sheridan\u2019s efforts to obtain the ingredients used in the production of methamphetamines. Employees at a Target store in Missoula detained Sheridan for the attempted shoplifting of five boxes of suphedrine tablets on May 18, 2001. Sheridan confessed to a police officer and Target employee that she had attempted to steal the tablets. Sheridan admitted that she had stolen several boxes of suphedrine tablets from Target in the past.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-8\">\u00b610 Officer Fiddler spoke with a citizen informant on July 18, 2001, who had been involved with Sheridan. The citizen reported to Officer Fiddler that Sheridan had lived on his property for some period of time. The citizen had found a box labeled \u201cJune\u2019s Stuff\u2019 on his property that contained acetone, red devil lye, toluene, coffee filters, and several \u201chot plates.\u201d Officer Fiddler stated in the application that he knew from his training and experience that those items are used in the production of methamphetamines. The citizen also reported that his closet had been stained brown during the time that Sheridan had lived <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>on his property. Officer Fiddler stated in the application that materials are commonly stained brown during the production of methamphetamines. The citizen informed Officer Fiddler that he found empty suphedrine boxes in Sheridan\u2019s vehicle and that he believed that Sheridan concealed the items used to produce methamphetamines in the trunk of her car because Sheridan would never allow him to be close to it.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-4\">\u00b611 A drug force agent observed Sheridan purchasing two cans of toluol from a hardware store in Ronan on October 17, 2001. The application stated that toluol constitutes a known ingredient in the production of methamphetamines.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-5\">\u00b612 A tribal police officer advised Officer Fiddler on November 5, 2001, of information concerning the home of Sheridan\u2019s parents. The officer stated that Sheridan had been responsible for watching her parent\u2019s house for two weeks while they were out of town. Sheridan\u2019s parents became ill with sinus problems shortly after they returned home. Officer Fiddler stated in the application that based on his experience he knows that it is common for people to have sinus problems when they are exposed to a location where the production of methamphetamines has taken place.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-6\">\u00b613 The application contains the reports of two concerned citizens who reported that Sheridan operated a methamphetamine laboratory at Barnaby\u2019s residence. A concerned citizen contacted Officer Fiddler on November 7, 2001, to report that Sheridan lived with a \u201cPeter or Joe\u201d Bamaby at Bamaby\u2019s house near Coldwater Lane. The concerned citizen believed that Sheridan operated a methamphetamine lab at Bamaby\u2019s residence. The application did not state the source of the citizen\u2019s information. Another citizen informant contacted Officer Fiddler on November 28, 2001, to report that Sheridan operated a methamphetamine lab at Barnaby\u2019s house. The application again failed to state the source of the citizen\u2019s information.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-7\">\u00b614 An agent with the drag task force contacted a local pharmacist in January of 2002 to determine whether the pharmacist knew of any people who had been purchasing large amounts of pseudoephedrine or ephedrine products. The application stated that pseudoephedrine and ephedrine are known to be essential ingredients in the production of methamphetamines. The employee reported that Sheridan visited the store at least once a week to purchase ephedrine products. The pharmacist also reported that she suspected Sheridan of the illicit use of ephedrine products due to certain indicators. The pharmacist reported that Sheridan appeared \u201cjittery,\u201d had bags under her eyes, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>and always paid in cash. The pharmacist knew these indicators of methamphetamine use as the result of speaking with a drug task force agent on a previous case.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-4\">\u00b615 The application stated that Officer Fiddler made contact with a concerned citizen on January 17,2002, who personally viewed a series of odd events at Barnaby\u2019s residence after Sheridan\u2019s arrival. The citizen reported that he knew of Sheridan\u2019s arrival at Barnaby\u2019s house by the presence of Sheridan\u2019s car, a gray 1987 Cougar. The citizen reported that he knew Sheridan from living in the Arlee area and also knew that the vehicle belonged to her. The citizen reported that Sheridan\u2019s vehicle had spent a lot of time at the Barnaby residence over the previous two months.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-5\">\u00b616 The concerned citizen reported that unusual activities had been occurring at the Barnaby residence since the arrival of Sheridan\u2019s vehicle. The citizen reported heavy traffic to and from the Barnaby residence at all hours of the day and night, with visitors staying only for a short amount of time. The concerned citizen observed someone back Sheridan\u2019s vehicle up to the door of Bamaby\u2019s house and then unload various items from the trunk. The citizen further stated that Barnaby had built a makeshift barrier out of tarps and plastic to prevent neighbors from seeing Barnaby and Sheridan unloading items from Sheridan\u2019s car. The barrier also prevented the citizen from viewing some movement around the property. The citizen reported that before Sheridan\u2019s arrival, Barnaby burned a fire outside his home only once or twice a year for the purposes of heating a sweat lodge, but now a fire burned almost constantly. The fire always burned during periods of strange activity at the house.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-6\">\u00b617 The warrant application stated that all of the persons mentioned in the application had given reliable information in the past. They had all been proven reliable with corroborating information that resulted in arrests from the information they provided. The application further stated that all of the above informants operated separate and apart from each other, and were not aware of the other\u2019s participation. The application for a warrant did not distinguish between confidential informants, citizen informants, and concerned citizens.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-7\">\u00b618 Judge McNeil apparently signed the warrant on February 11, 2002, although the warrant was dated February <em>11,2001. </em>The warrant authorized officers to search a residence identified as 21 Coldwater Drive. Officers conducted a search of Bamaby\u2019s residence pursuant to the warrant two days later. The search revealed various items used in the production of methamphetamines and other drug paraphernalia. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>The State charged Barnaby and Sheridan with operating a clandestine laboratory in violation of \u00a7 45-9-132, MCA, on September 19, 2002. \u00b619 Barnaby and Sheridan moved separately to suppress the evidence discovered during the search before trial based upon a lack of probable cause to search Bamaby\u2019s residence. Both argued that the search was invalid due to the fact that Judge McNeil signed the warrant in 2001 and the officers conducted the search in 2002. The District Court agreed with the State that Judge McNeil likely had made a typographical error and actually had signed the warrant on February 11, 2002. Both also challenged the warrant\u2019s validity on the grounds that it authorized the officers to search a residence located at 21 Coldwater Drive, while Barnaby\u2019s house is located at 1-12 Coldwater Lane.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-4\">\u00b620 Officer Fiddler testified at the suppression hearing as to how he had determined Bamaby\u2019s address using a police database compiled through emergency responses. Officer Fiddler further testified that he had grown up in the area and he had known the location of Barnaby\u2019s house since he was a child. Officer Fiddler also attached a map of the area and a photograph of the house to the warrant application that described how to reach the house. Finally, Officer Fiddler testified that the low density of housing in the area, \u201cmaybe five, six\u201d per square mile, made misidentification of the house unlikely. This evidence satisfied the District Court that the warrant correctly described the house to search.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-5\">\u00b621 Barnaby\u2019s motion also argued that much of the information contained in the application for a warrant pertained solely to Sheridan, and that such information did not provide probable cause to search his residence. Barnaby further contended that the information that did concern his residence did not amount to sufficient evidence to establish probable cause. Sheridan\u2019s motion also challenged the factual predicates used to establish probable cause to support the issuance of the warrant. She alleged that the police had failed to corroborate adequately information received from informants. The State\u2019s response brief asserted that Officer Fiddler had stated in the warrant application that each person listed in the warrant application had provided reliable information in the past. Neither Barnaby nor Sheridan filed a reply brief to challenge this assertion.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-6\">\u00b622 At Bamaby\u2019s request, the District Court combined his suppression hearing with Sheridan\u2019s after he attested that \u201cat least exactly the same witnesses, if not exactly the same evidence\u201d would be presented. Counsel for Sheridan and Barnaby relied on the arguments made in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>Sheridan\u2019s brief in support of her motion to suppress regarding the State\u2019s lack of corroboration. Barnaby explicitly joined in the arguments made in Sheridan\u2019s brief. Their questioning of Officer Fiddler at the suppression hearing centered on the address listed in the warrant application. The District Court denied Barnaby\u2019s motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-4\">\u00b623 The case then proceeded to jury selection. The State exercised two peremptory challenges to remove tribal members, Mary Lefthand (Lefthand) and Ronda Michell (Michell). Lefthand had stated during voir dire that Bamaby\u2019s father was her adopted brother. Michell stated that she considered Barnaby\u2019s counsel, Joey Jayne (Jayne), a good friend. Barnaby also used a peremptory challenge to remove a tribal member from the jury, Steven DuPuis (DuPuis).</p>\n<p id=\"b250-5\">\u00b624 Barnaby then objected to the State\u2019s use of peremptory challenges in chambers. Defense counsel argued that the State improperly removed Lefthand and Michell from the venire based solely upon their race in violation of the rule set forth in <em>Batson v. Kentucky </em>(1986), 476 U.S. 79, 106 S.Ct. 1712, 90 L.Ed.2d 69. The State responded by explaining that it had stmck Lefthand because of her relationship to the defendant, and Michell because she was a close friend of Barnaby\u2019s attorney. The District Court also noted that Barnaby\u2019s counsel had stmck DuPuis from the venire. The District Court overruled Bamaby\u2019s <em>Batson </em>objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-6\">\u00b625 The jury convicted Barnaby of operating a clandestine laboratory. Barnaby filed a motion for a new trial contending that the District Court had improperly denied his <em>Batson </em>objection. The District Court denied Bamaby\u2019s motion in a written order. The court explained that the record clearly indicated that of the two tribal members challenged by the State, one considered herself a good friend of Barnaby\u2019s attorney, and the other was related to Barnaby. The District Court further explained its rationale for denying the motion by noting that the State did not challenge another tribal member, DuPuis.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-7\">\u00b626 The District Court held a sentencing hearing on October 21,2004. Defense argued for alternatives to imprisonment in light of the fact that Barnaby was a nonviolent first time offender according to \u00a7 46-18-225, MCA. Defense counsel recommended that Barnaby receive a term at the Department of Corrections. The State recommended a sentence of ten years at the Montana State Prison, with five suspended. The District Court sentenced Barnaby to eight years at the Montana State Prison, with three suspended.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>\u00b627 Barnaby objected to the sentence on the basis that the District Court did not adequately consider alternatives as required by \u00a7 46-18-225, MCA. The District Court responded that it had adequately considered the alternatives to imprisonment. The written sentencing order issued by the District Court stated the court had taken into account the nature of the offense in this matter for which the court has significant concerns and Barnaby\u2019s lack of any prior felony record. The District Court also stated that it imposed a prison sentence to provide punishment to Barnaby with an opportunity for his rehabilitation. The order did not mention any of the criteria contained in \u00a7 46-18-225, MCA. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b251-5\">\u00b628 Barnaby contends that the District Court improperly denied his motion to suppress evidence as the search of his residence was not supported by probable cause. He also argues that the District Court improperly denied his <em>Batson </em>objection. Finally, Barnaby maintains that the District Court failed to consider adequately alternatives to imprisonment when imposing his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-6\">Motion to Suppress</p>\n<p id=\"b251-7\">\u00b629 We have adopted the \u201ctotality of the circumstances\u201d test set forth in <em>Illinois v. Gates </em>(1983), 462 U.S. 213, 103 S.Ct. 2317, 76 L.Ed.2d 527, to evaluate whether probable cause supported the issuance of a warrant. <em>State v. Reesman, </em>2000 MT 243, \u00b6 24, 301 Mont. 408, \u00b6 24, 10 P.3d 83, \u00b6 24. Under the totality of the circumstances test, the issuing judicial officer must make a practical, common sense determination, given all the evidence contained in the application for a search warrant, whether a fair probability exists that contraband or evidence of a crime will be found in a particular place. <em>Gates, </em>462 U.S. at 238, 103 S.Ct. at 2332.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-8\">\u00b630  An application for a search warrant must state facts sufficient to show probable cause for the issuance of a warrant. A determination of probable cause does not require facts sufficient to make a showing of criminal activity, rather, the issuing judicial officer must only determine that there exists a probability of criminal activity. <em>State v. Rinehart </em>(1993), 262 Mont. 204, 210, 864 P.2d 1219, 1222. Probable cause must be determined solely from the information contained within the four corners of the search warrant application. <em>Rinehart, </em>262 Mont. at 211, 864 P.2d at 1223. Our function as a reviewing court is to ensure ultimately that the issuing judicial officer had a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>\u201csubstantial basis\u201d to determine that probable cause existed. <em>Reesman, </em>\u00b6 19.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-4\">\u00b631 The application for a search warrant begins with credible information of Sheridan\u2019s involvement in the production of methamphetamines. A concerned citizen reported from first-hand knowledge and personal observations that Galpin, a well-known methamphetamine manufacturer, taught Sheridan how to produce methamphetamines. The first-hand report of a concerned citizen generally represents reliable information. <em>State v. Oleson, </em>1998 MT 130, \u00b6 14, 289 Mont. 139, \u00b6 14, 959 P.2d 503, \u00b6 14 <em>(overruled in part on other grounds by State v. Kuneff, </em>1998 MT 287, \u00b6 19, 291 Mont. 474, \u00b6 19, 970 P.2d 556, \u00b6 19). Minez also reported that Galpin taught Sheridan how to manufacture methamphetamines.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-5\">\u00b632 The application then charts a continuing course of action by Sheridan to gather and possess the materials used to manufacture methamphetamines through the first-hand reports of several reliable sources. Sheridan had been arrested shoplifting several boxes of suphedrine tablets from a Target store and admitted to a police officer and Target employee that she had successfully shoplifted several boxes of tablets on previous occasions. A citizen informant reported finding a box labeled \u201cJune\u2019s Stuff\u2019 that contained several items used in the production of methamphetamines. A narcotics officer witnessed Sheridan purchasing two cans of toluol from a hardware store. A local pharmacist observed that Sheridan purchased ephedrine tablets at least once a week and reported that Sheridan had the physical appearance of a person using methamphetamines.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-6\">\u00b633 Bamaby contends that evidence of Sheridan\u2019s involvement in the production of methamphetamines does not establish probable cause to search his residence. We agree that it does not follow in all cases, \u201csimply from the existence of probable cause to believe a suspect guilty, there is also probable cause to search his residence.\u201d <em>State v. Kaluza </em>(1993), 262 Mont. 360, 362, 865 P.2d 263, 264 <em>(citing United States v. Valenzuela </em>(9th Cir. 1979), 596 F.2d 824, 828). \u201cBut it is also clear that interpreting a search warrant in the proper \u2018commonsense and realistic fashion\u2019 may result in the inference of probable cause to believe that criminal objects are located in a particular place.\u201d <em>Valenzuela, </em>596 F.2d at 828 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b252-7\">\u00b634 The evidence of Sheridan\u2019s involvement with methamphetamines must be considered along with the other information contained in the application. <em>See State v. St. Marks, </em>2002 MT 285, \u00b6 23, 312 Mont. 468, \u00b6 23, 59 P.3d 1113, \u00b6 23; <em>State v. Gray, </em>2001 MT 250, \u00b6 11, 307 Mont. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>124, \u00b6 11, 38 P.3d 775, \u00b6 11. A concerned citizen contacted Officer Fiddler on January 17, 2002, to report that he personally viewed Sheridan\u2019s car spending a lot of time at the Bamaby residence over the previous two months. The citizen stated that he knew Sheridan from the Arlee area and knew the car that she drove. That report constitutes rehable information of Sheridan\u2019s frequent presence at Barnaby\u2019s residence. <em>Oleson, </em>\u00b6 14. The report of a separate concerned citizen who contacted Officer Fiddler on November 7, 2001, also contained information that Sheridan resided at least part-time at Bamaby\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-4\">\u00b635 The information pertaining to Sheridan possesses probative value when determining whether a fair probability exists that the items used in the manufacturing of methamphetamines may be found at Barnaby\u2019s residence. \u201cThe critical element in a reasonable search is not that the owner of the property is suspected of crime but that there is reasonable cause to believe that the specific \u2018things\u2019 to be searched for and seized are located on the property to which entry is sought.\u201d <em>Zurcher v. Stanford Daily </em>(1978), 436 U.S. 547, 556, 98 S.Ct. 1970, 1976-77, 56 L.Ed.2d. 525. We deemed it appropriate in <em>Gray, </em>\u00b6 21, to impute to Gray suspicious activity engaged in by his companion, Wallace, in assessing probable cause. Similarly in <em>St. Marks, </em>\u00b6 38, we determined that corroboration of criminal conduct by St. Mark\u2019s companion, Torres, could be imputed to St. Marks. The same holds trae for corroboration of Sheridan\u2019s conduct in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-5\">\u00b636 We emphasize that Sheridan\u2019s mere presence at the house does not amount to sufficient probable cause to search Barnaby\u2019s residence. <em>See Kaluza, </em>262 Mont. at 362, 865 P.2d at 264. The information relating to Sheridan\u2019s involvement with methamphetamines and presence at Bamaby\u2019s is not so compelling that it establishes probable cause of Barnaby\u2019s own involvement in manufacturing methamphetamines. The information may support a conclusion that the instruments used to manufacture methamphetamines may be found at Bamaby\u2019s residence, however, when considered in combination with other information under the totality of the circumstances test. <em>See State v. Holstine </em>(1993), 260 Mont. 310, 315, 860 P.2d 110, 113.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-6\">\u00b637 The information pertaining to Sheridan must be evaluated in conjunction with the information specifically related to suspicious and illegal activities at Barnaby\u2019s residence. A concerned citizen contacted Officer Fiddler on November 7,2001, to report that they believed that Sheridan operated a methamphetamine laboratory at Bamaby\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>residence. A separate citizen informant contacted Officer Fiddler on November 28, 2001, to report that Sheridan operated a methamphetamine laboratory at Barnaby\u2019s residence. The January 17, 2002, report of the concerned citizen who reported Sheridan\u2019s presence at Barnaby\u2019s house also reported personally viewing a series of suspicious activities since Sheridan\u2019s arrival. The citizen reported that he observed, among other things, heavy traffic to and from the Barnaby residence at all hours of the day and night with visitors staying only for a short amount of time; that someone backed Sheridan\u2019s car all the way to the door of the house to unload items from the trunk; and a barrier had been built on the residence to hide movement on the property and block anyone from further viewing items being unloaded from the trunk.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-4\">\u00b638 Barnaby uses a \u201cdivide and conquer\u201d approach for evaluating the sufficiency of the application for a warrant. After dismissing the information concerning Sheridan as an insufficient basis for probable cause, Barnaby engages in a mechanical application of <em>Reesman </em>to evaluate separately the reports of the three concerned citizens. Barnaby argues that the reports of the concerned citizens who contacted Officer Fiddler on November 7, 2002, and November 28, 2002, provide no support in a probable cause analysis as the warrant application fails to state whether the citizens based the information on their own personal observations. <em>See Reesman, </em>\u00b6 29. Barnaby maintains that the report of the concerned citizen on January 17,2002, required independent corroboration because the warrant application failed to describe the circumstances under which the information became known, despite the application explicitly stating that the concerned citizen personally observed the events described in the warrant. <em>Oleson, </em>\u00b6 14.

Factors that possess little probative value on their own, when considered under the totality of the circumstances test, can provide support for a determination of substantial evidence to conclude probable cause existed when considered in combination with other information. <em>Holstine, </em>260 Mont. at 315, 860 P.2d at 113.

See Aguilar v. Texas </em>(1964), 378 U.S. 108, 84 S.Ct. 1509, 12 L.Ed.2d 723; <em>Spinelli v. United States </em>(1969), 393 U.S. 410, 89 S.Ct. 584, 21 L.Ed.2d 637. In <em>Gates, </em>the Court rejected the two-prong test of \u201creliability\u201d and \u201cbasis of knowledge\u201d holding that the elements should not \u201cbe understood as entirely separate and independent requirements to be rigidly exacted in every case.\u201d <em>Gates, </em>462 U.S. at 230, 103 S.Ct. at 2328. Bamaby\u2019s approach rigidly evaluates the \u201creliability\u201d and \u201cbasis of knowledge\u201d of an individual informant and then mandates whether independent corroboration is required, without regard to any other information that might be contained in the application. This method conflicts with the totality of the circumstances approach by forcing a judicial officer to apply a strict test to evaluate each element in a warrant separately rather than allowing the judicial officer to consider the information as a whole when determine probable cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-5\">\u00b641 The first Dissent argues that our holding undermines <em>Reesman. </em>Dissent, \u00b6\u00b6 61-71. We concede that this case deviates slightly from our decision in <em>Reesman </em>as we cannot easily reconcile <em>Reesman\u2019s </em>strict rules requiring independent police corroboration with the flexibility of the totality of the circumstances test. Probable cause poses a fluid concept turning on the assessment of probabilities in a particular factual context, \u201cnot readily, or even usefully, reduced to a neat set of legal rules.\u201d <em>Gates, </em>462 U.S. at 232, 103 S.Ct. at 2329. <em>Reesman </em>still provides useful guidelines to evaluate a warrant application, however, the guidelines become impractical in cases such as this, where the police receive rehable reports from several concerned citizens yet no single report satisfies all the <em>Reesman </em>criteria.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-6\">\u00b642 We do not disturb the principle that independent police corroboration represents a key element in determining whether probable cause exists to issue a warrant. We also admonish police officers to corroborate independently information from sources of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>questionable reliability. <em>See Gates, </em>462 U.S. at 241-42, 103 S.Ct. at 2334. We simply determine that the proposition set forth in <em>Reesman </em>that independent police work represents the only method of corroboration under the totality of the circumstances test is wrong as a matter of law. Two justices specially concurred and one dissented from the majority\u2019s opinion in <em>Reesman </em>because of this very issue. <em>Reesman, </em>\u00b6 49, \u00b6 80.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-4\">\u00b643 Justice Regnier joined the Court in determining that no probable cause existed to support the decision of the judicial officer to issue a warrant. <em>Reesman, </em>\u00b6 49. Justice Regnier in his concurring opinion rejected as \u201ctoo restrictive,\u201d however, the Court\u2019s notion that corroboration must be accomplished through police investigation. <em>Reesman, </em>\u00b6 49 (Regnier, J., concurring). He emphasized that \u201ccorroboration could be accomplished by other means\u201d than police investigation. <em>Reesman, </em>\u00b6 58 (Regnier, J., concurring). Justice Regnier recognized that the Court\u2019s myopic focus on \u201cpolice investigation\u201d diverts the judicial officer\u2019s attention from the more important question of whether the warrant application establishes probable cause for the search. <em>Reesman, </em>\u00b6 58 (Regnier, J., concurring).</p>\n<p id=\"b256-5\">\u00b644 The second Dissent, \u00b6\u00b6 72-191, mischaracterizes our holding as overruling or calling into doubt an array of precedents that relate to this decision only in that each affirms a finding of probable cause to issue a search warrant. For example, <em>State v. Meyer, </em>2004 MT 272, \u00b6\u00b6 25, 31, 323 Mont. 173, \u00b6\u00b6 25, 31, 99 P.3d 185, \u00b6\u00b6 25, 31, is the first in a string of cases cited by the Dissent as being overruled or called into doubt. We strike not even a glancing blow upon the continued vitality of <em>Meyer. </em>The Dissent cites two paragraphs in <em>Meyer </em>that discuss issues that we do not even tangentially address: the timeliness of a warrant application and the proposition that we deem as reliable an informant that makes a statement against their interest. <em>Meyer, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 25, 31.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-6\">\u00b645 Our decision similarly strikes no blow on the continued vitality of other cases that cite <em>Reesman. See, e.g., State v. Bowman, </em>2004 MT 119, \u00b6 30, 321 Mont. 176, \u00b6 30, 89 P.3d 986, \u00b6 30 (using <em>Reesman </em>guidelines to determine that game warden corroborated anonymous tip by learning from taxidermist that bullet had pierced cape from bull elk); <em>State v. Olson, </em>2003 MT 61, \u00b6\u00b6 25-27, 314 Mont. 402, \u00b6\u00b6 25-27, 66 P.3d 297, \u00b6\u00b6 25-27 <em>(usingReesman </em>guidelines to determine that report of non-anonymous, concerned citizen who witnessed meth lab provided sufficient probable cause to support warrant); <em>State v. Grams, </em>2002 MT 188, \u00b6\u00b6 17-19, 311 Mont. 102, \u00b6\u00b6 17-19, 53 P.3d 897, \u00b6\u00b6 17-19 (using <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number><em>Reesman </em>to conclude that five informants\u2019 reports based on personal observations against their interest provided adequate basis for warrant). We fully agree that the reliable reports in those cases constituted sufficient probable cause to support a search warrant. We simply overrule an unduly restrictive rule that never should have been imposed under the long-established and flexible totality of the circumstances test. <em>Gates, </em>426 U.S. at 230-231, 103 S.Ct at 2328 (defining probable cause as a practical nontechnical concept more appropriately defined by the totality of circumstances approach than any rigid demand that specific tests be satisfied for every informant\u2019s tip).</p>\n<p id=\"b257-4\">\u00b646  We conclude that the District Court properly denied Bamaby\u2019s motion to suppress. The issuing judicial officer had a substantial basis for determining that probable cause existed to search Bamaby\u2019s residence considering together all the information provided in the warrant under the totality of the circumstances test. The warrant contained highly credible evidence of Sheridan\u2019s involvement in the production of methamphetamines and her presence at Bamaby\u2019s residence. Two separate concerned citizens contacted Officer Fiddler to report that Sheridan operated a methamphetamine laboratory at Bamaby\u2019s residence. Another concerned citizen personally viewed a series of suspicious activities at Bamaby\u2019s residence following Sheridan\u2019s arrival. The fact that the application for a warrant did not include a specific account of the circumstances under which some informants viewed the events, or whether the two citizens based their reports on personal observations, does not preclude a court from finding probable cause. The information relating to Sheridan and the reports of concerned citizens provide a basis for finding probable cause in this case, although none of the reports, on its own, satisfy the <em>Reesman </em>criteria.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-5\"><em>Batson </em>Challenge</p>\n<p id=\"b257-6\">\u00b647 Barnaby next contends that the District Court improperly denied his <em>Batson </em>challenge. We will defer to the trial court\u2019s findings of fact unless clearly erroneous, when considering a trial court\u2019s ruling on a challenge that a litigant has exercised its use of peremptory challenges in a discriminating manner, and will review the trial court\u2019s application of law de novo. <em>State v. Ford, </em>2001 MT 230, \u00b6 7, 306 Mont. 517, \u00b6 7, 39 P.3d 108, \u00b6 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-7\">\u00b648  <em>Batson </em>set out a three-prong test to determine whether the State exercised its peremptory challenges in a discriminatory manner. First, the defendant must make out a prima facie case of purposeful <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>discrimination. <em>Ford, </em>\u00b6 16. To make a prima facie case, the defendant must show that he or she belongs to a cognizable racial group. <em>Batson, </em>476 U.S. at 96, 106 S.Ct. at 1723. The defendant may then rely on the fact that peremptory challenges constitute a jury selection practice that allows those to discriminate who are of a mind to discriminate. <em>Batson, </em>476 U.S. at 96, 106 S.Ct. at 1723. The defendant must then show that these facts, and any other relevant circumstances, raise an inference that the State used that practice to exclude members of the venire from the petit jury on account of their race. <em>Batson, </em>476 U.S. at 96, 106 S.Ct. at 1723.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-4\">\u00b649 Once the defendant makes a prima facie case for discrimination, we proceed to the second step, where the State must provide a race-neutral explanation for its use of peremptory strikes. <em>Ford, </em>\u00b6 16. Finally, the trial court then will determine if the defendant has established purposeful discrimination. <em>Ford, </em>\u00b6 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-5\">\u00b650 Barnaby objected immediately after the State removed Lefthand and Michell from the venire. The District Court did not rule whether Barnaby had presented a prima facie case for discrimination. Nevertheless, the State provided its explanations for striking the jurors. The District Court did not rule on the sufficiency of the State\u2019s justifications, but noted for the record that the State did not strike DuPuis, a tribal member, from the venire and overruled Barnaby\u2019s objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-6\">\u00b651 Barnaby contends that the District Court improperly applied the third step of the <em>Batson </em>test. Barnaby characterized the District Court\u2019s denial of his challenge as based upon the court\u2019s finding that the State did not strike DuPuis from the venire. Barnaby correctly points out that a court may not deny relief simply because the State did not strike all members of a particular race from the jury under <em>Batson. See United States v. Harris </em>(6th Cir. 1999), 192 F.3d 580.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-7\">\u00b652  Whether a party presented a case of purposeful discrimination represents a factual question, thus we will defer to the trial court\u2019s findings of fact unless clearly erroneous. <em>See Ford, </em>\u00b6 18 (holding that an appellate court will defer to the trial court\u2019s findings unless clearly erroneous). Therefore, the trial court must develop fully a record for review - a record that includes all relevant facts and information relied upon by the trial court to render its decision, as well as a full explanation of the court\u2019s rationale. <em>Ford, </em>\u00b6 18.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-8\">\u00b653 Our review of the record demonstrates that the District Court properly overruled Barnaby\u2019s objection based, in large part, on the race neutral explanations provided by the prosecutor. The State provided <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>race neutral explanations for both Lefthand and Michell according to the second step of <em>Batson. See Ford, </em>\u00b6 16. It explained that it used a peremptory challenge on Michell because she considered Barnaby\u2019s trial attorney a good friend. The State removed Lefthand because Barnaby\u2019s father is her adopted brother. The District Court admitted into evidence notes taken by the State during voir dire to support its race-neutral explanations. The District Court then noted that Bamaby\u2019s counsel removed DuPuis. Thus, the fact that the State did not strike DuPuis represents only one of several relevant facts that the District Court considered in overruling Barnaby\u2019s objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-4\">\u00b654 Although the District Court developed a record at the time of Barnaby\u2019s objection that included all relevant facts, the court failed to provide a full explanation of its rationale for overruling the <em>Batson </em>objection as required by <em>State v. Parrish, </em>2005 MT 112, \u00b6 19, 327 Mont. 88, \u00b6 19, 111 P.3d 671, \u00b6 19. The District Court simply overruled Bamaby\u2019s objection after hearing the State\u2019s explanations and noting that the State did not strike DuPuis. This full explanation proves necessary to our review of the merits of any <em>Batson-type </em>challenge. <em>Parrish, </em>\u00b6 19.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-5\">\u00b655 We admonish the District Court to provide more detailed reasoning for the basis of denying a <em>Batson </em>challenge, even in cases where the defendant simply objects to the State\u2019s use of peremptory challenges instead of specifically invoking the <em>Batson </em>language. We uphold the District Court\u2019s decision, however, because the court overruled Bamaby\u2019s <em>Batson </em>objection before our ruling in <em>Parrish. </em>Furthermore, the record demonstrates that the State provided highly credible race-neutral explanations. We remind district courts to follow the procedural mandate of <em>Ford </em>and <em>Parrish </em>to build a record and provide a full explanation for the denial of <em>a Batson </em>challenge in future cases to permit this Court to review adequately the denial of such a challenge on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-6\">Sentence</p>\n<p id=\"b259-7\">\u00b656 Bamaby finally contends that the District Court failed to consider adequately alternatives to imprisonment under \u00a7 46-18-225, MCA. We review a district court\u2019s imposition of a criminal sentence for legality. We review the trial court\u2019s interpretation on sentencing questions regarding statutory interpretation to determine whether it is correct. <em>State v. McDanold, </em>2004 MT 167, \u00b6 12, 322 Mont. 31, \u00b6 12, 97 P.3d 1076, \u00b6 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-8\">\u00b657 Barnaby is a nonviolent first time felony offender. A \u201cnonviolent felony offender\u201d is a person who has committed a felony other than a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>\u201ccrime of violence\u201d as defined by \u00a7 46-18-104(2), MCA. The operation of a clandestine laboratory in violation of \u00a7 45-9-132, MCA, does not fall within any of the definitions of a \u201ccrime of violence.\u201d <em>See </em>\u00a7 46-18-104(2), MCA. We recognize that operation of a clandestine laboratory constitutes a \u201cviolent offense\u201d under the Sexual or Violent Offender Registration Act. Section 46-23-502(9)(a), MCA. That act\u2019s inclusion of operation of a clandestine laboratory as one of the specifically enumerated \u201cviolent offenses\u201d does not affect the classification of Bamaby as a \u201cnonviolent felony offender.\u201d The terms \u201ccrime of violence\u201d and \u201cviolent offense\u201d relate to separate statutes that serve different purposes and as a consequence, do not encompass the identical set of crimes.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-4\">\u00b658 Section 46-18-225(1), MCA, requires a district court first to consider alternatives to imprisonment when sentencing a \u201cnonviolent felony offender.\u201d A district court must examine the sentencing criteria in \u00a7 46-18-225(2), MCA, in considering alternatives to imprisonment. <em>See State v. Pence </em>(1995), 273 Mont. 223, 231, 902 P.2d 41, 46. The statute further requires that if a district court sentences such an offender to prison, the judge shall state the reasons why it did not select an alternative to imprisonment, based on the criteria of \u00a7 46-18-225(2), MCA. Section 46-18-225(3), MCA; <em>Pence, </em>273 Mont. at 231, 902 P.2d at 46.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-5\">\u00b659 The District Court stated that it imposed a prison sentence because of the nature of the offense, Barnaby\u2019s lack of any prior felony record, and to provide punishment with an opportunity for rehabilitation. The District Court failed to mention, however, any of the criteria set forth in \u00a7 46-18-225(2), MCA, and fails to discuss why, when considering those factors, it deemed inappropriate an alternative to imprisonment. Thus, we vacate that portion of Barnaby\u2019s sentence and remand for further consideration of his sentence in light of the criteria set forth in \u00a7 46-18-225, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-6\">\u00b660 Affirmed in part and remanded in part for further proceedings.</p>\n<judges id=\"b260-7\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES WARNER, LEAPHART and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b260-8\">JUSTICE COTTER</author>\n<p id=\"AjxC\">dissents.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-9\">\u00b661 I dissent from the Court\u2019s disposition of Issue 1. Because I would reverse the District Court\u2019s denial of Barnaby\u2019s motion to suppress the evidence discovered during the search of his home, I would not reach Issues 2 and 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-10\">\u00b662 There was a multitude of miscellaneous information cited in the Application for Search Warrant to suggest that Sheridan knew how to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>cook methamphetamine, and that she had been observed purchasing or in possession of the precursors to methamphetamine on more than one occasion. However, assuming the Application contained all relevant information, at no time during the nearly two years of investigation leading up to the search of Barnaby\u2019s home were the tribal police alerted that Sheridan was engaged somewhere in the actual manufacture of methamphetamine. And I submit that, given the sparse and unreliable information these officers possessed concerning Barnaby, there was no probable cause to support the conclusion that a lab was located in his home.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-4\">\u00b663 The Application reflects that a concerned citizen \u201creported\u201d that Sheridan was \u201cliving with a Barnaby,\u201d and that he/she \u201cbelieved\u201d that Sheridan was operating a methamphetamine lab at his residence. Then, a \u201ccitizen informant\u201d reported that Sheridan was operating a methamphetamine lab at the Barnaby residence. As the Court concedes at \u00b6 13, the Application did not state the source of either citizen\u2019s information, nor did it indicate whether either person had personally observed the lab operation.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-5\">\u00b664 The sole remaining allegations involving Barnaby, as detailed in \u00b6\u00b6 15-16 of the Court\u2019s Opinion, summarize activities ostensibly observed on Bamaby\u2019s property that, standing alone, were neither unlawful nor illegal. The Court cites as persuasive the fact that Barnaby apparently took steps to prevent neighbors from observing his activities. Ironically, we have held that the steps taken by a person to prevent observation of his or her activities constitutes evidence of an actual expectation of privacy, a reasonable and lawful goal. See <em>State v. Bullock </em>(1995), 272 Mont. 361, 384, 901 P.2d 61, 74-75, and <em>State v. Siegal </em>(1997), 281 Mont. 250, 274-75, 934 P.2d 176, 190, <em>overruled in part and on other grounds by State v. Kuneff, </em>1998 MT 287, 291 Mont. 474, 970 P.2d 556. Here, however, we conclude that such conduct contributes to a finding of probable cause to search his home.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-6\">\u00b665 In <em>Reesman, </em>this Court analyzed the several possible sources of an informant\u2019s information. From this analysis emerged a three-prong test that has repeatedly been used by this Court to determine whether probable cause exists for the issuance of a search warrant:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b261-7\">1) Was the informant anonymous or was the information provided hearsay? If so, independent corroboration of his or her information is required;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b261-10\">2) If the informant was not anonymous, was the information provided based on personal observation of criminal activity or was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>the information hearsay? If hearsay, independent corroboration is required; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b262-4\">3) If the information from a non-anonymous informant was gathered by personal observation of criminal activity, was the informant reliable?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b262-5\"><em>Reesman, \u00b6\u00b6 </em>28-31. Here, the Application does not tell us whether the \u201cconcerned citizen\u201d was anonymous, nor does it relate that the information provided by <em>either </em>citizen was based on personal knowledge. Thus, under <em>Reesman </em>and its considerable progeny, independent corroboration of their information was required. No such corroboration was sought or obtained in this case, yet we find no fault. To the contrary, we conclude that \u201cthe fact that the application for a warrant did not include a specific account of the circumstances under which some informants viewed the events, or whether the two citizens based their reports on personal observations, does not preclude a court from finding probable cause.\u201d See \u00b6 46. We then proceed to conclude that <em>Reesman\u2019s </em>\u201cstrict rules\u201d cannot be reconciled with the flexibility of the \u201ctotality of the circumstances\u201d test that the United States Supreme Court espoused in <em>Illinois v. Gates. </em>See \u00b6 41.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-6\">\u00b666 In justifying its result, the Court both exaggerates the complexity of <em>Reesman </em>and oversimplifies <em>Gates. </em>Most importantly, the Court refuses to acknowledge that Gaies-like Aeesmcm \u2014 requires the magistrate to consider, among the totality of the circumstances, the \u201cveracity\u201d and \u201cbasis of knowledge\u201d of persons supplying hearsay information. <em>Gates, </em>462 U.S. at 238, 103 S. Ct. at 2332. The Court reaffirmed in <em>Gates </em>that \u201cwholly conclusory statements,\u201d or statements that an informant \u201cbelieves\u201d that a crime is being committed, will not do. The Court said that a magistrate\u2019s determination of probable cause \u201ccannot be a mere ratification of the bare conclusions of others.\u201d <em>Gates, </em>462 U.S. at 239, 103 S. Ct. at 2333. In <em>Gates, </em>the police conducted significant independent police work to corroborate the informant\u2019s tip. In fact, it was <em>because </em>of the independent corroboration provided by the police in <em>Gates </em>that the Court concluded that there was a substantial basis for the issuance of the warrant. <em>Gates, </em>462 U.S at 246, 103 S. Ct. at 2336.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-7\">\u00b667 Similarly, in <em>Rinehart, </em>we analyzed an application for search warrant that relied in part upon an anonymous Crimestoppers\u2019 tip. The Court concluded that the Crimestoppers\u2019 tip, by itself, was inadequate to support probable cause without further investigation to corroborate the information, but agreed that it merited consideration under the \u201ctotality of the circumstances\u201d test. <em>Rinehart, </em>262 Mont. at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>212-13, 864 P.2d at 1223. Notably, the totality of the circumstances in <em>Rinehart </em>included information from a reliable, non-anonymous informant who had seen the marijuana operation first-hand, and had described to the police, in great detail, its location and operation. <em>Rinehart, </em>262 Mont. at 212, 864 P.2d at 1224. In essence, the <em>Rinehart </em>magistrate used the Crimestopper tip to corroborate the known informant\u2019s first-hand information. <em>Rinehart, </em>262 Mont. at 211, 864 P.2d at 1223.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-4\">\u00b668 Here, by contrast, there was no known first-hand informant and no independent police investigation. In fact, there was no independent corroboration of criminal activity at Bamaby\u2019s home-from <em>any </em>source-police or otherwise. Ignoring this glaring deficiency, we stretch the \u201cflexible\u201d totality of the circumstances test beyond its intended limit, concluding in essence that one \u201cwholly conclusory statement\u201d from an unreliable source <em>(see Gates, infra) </em>magically becomes reliable by virtue of its pairing with a similar statement from a second unreliable source. Respectfully, all the discussion in the world cannot disguise the fact that we have taken two unreliable and uncorroborated allegations of criminal doings, added in a report detailing indisputably lawful front-yard activities, and, because of Sheridan\u2019s association with the occupant of the home, arrived at a sum finding of probable cause to search Barnaby\u2019s home, when in reality the sum is still zero. Without question, the \u201ctotality of the circumstances\u201d which we conclude supports the search of Barnaby\u2019s home is not nearly as substantial or reliable as were the circumstances in <em>either Rinehart </em>or <em>Gates.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b263-5\">\u00b669 The most troubling aspect of the Court\u2019s Opinion is its pronouncements regarding <em>Reesman. </em>Whereas <em>Reesman </em>was once the law, relied upon by district courts and this Court in dozens of rulings and opinions, and by law enforcement in countless analyses, its \u201cneat set of legal rules\u201d no longer apply; now, its guidelines are merely \u201cuseful.\u201d \u00b6 41.1 cannot understand why we would choose to abandon a clear guideline against which police officers evaluate the sufficiency of their evidence to justify the issuance of a warrant, in favor of no guidelines at all. We have effectively replaced a level of predictability with one of uncertainty and randomness.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-6\">\u00b670 Montana homes have long enjoyed special protection under our search and seizure jurisprudence.

Today, however, we have relaxed the requirements for a search warrant for a man\u2019s home, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>finding that vague uncorroborated accusations, coupled with guilt by association, is enough to justify the issuance of a warrant.

Specifically, the three tips that were essential to a finding of probable cause to search Barnaby\u2019s residence consist of little more than innuendo and bare suspicions reported by informants of unknown veracity. Nevertheless, the Court accepts these unsubstantiated tips as \u201creliable reports\u201d and \u201chighly credible evidence\u201d of unlawful activities being conducted at Barnaby\u2019s residence. <em>See </em>\u00b6\u00b6 34,37,41,46. Notably, we are never told why these reports are \u201creliable\u201d and \u201chighly credible.\u201d Perhaps the Court is deferring to the \u201cconcerned citizen\u201d and \u201ccitizen informant\u201d labels used by the search warrant applicant in reference to the persons who provided the three tips. Yet, the application contains no factual support whatsoever for the applicant\u2019s use of these labels. Moreover, the application does not support the conclusion that the unlawful activities alleged by these persons were probably occurring on or about the date of the application. Accordingly, there is no factual basis for presuming, as the Court has done, the reliability and timeliness of these essential tips.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>\u00b674 Its reasoning aside, the Court\u2019s Opinion effects, as Justice Cotter points out in her dissenting opinion, an astonishing (and, notably, unsolicited<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>) sea change in the law of search and seizure in Montana. Under the guise of avoiding \u201cmechanical application[s]\u201d of our case law and a \u201cdivide and conquer\u201d approach to evaluating search warrant applications, \u00b6 38, the Court not only ignores the broad individual privacy protections afforded Montanans by Article II, Sections 10 and 11, of the Montana Constitution, <em>see State v. Bullock </em>(1995), 272 Mont. 361, 383-84, 901 P.2d 61, 75; <em>State v. Siegal </em>(1997), 281 Mont. 250, 263, 264, 934 P.2d 176, 183, 184, <em>overruled in part on other grounds by State v. Kuneff, </em>1998 MT 287, \u00b6 19, 291 Mont. 474, \u00b6 19, 970 P.2d 556, \u00b6 19, but also calls into question a multitude of well-established precedents handed down by this Court since the adoption of these constitutional guarantees 34 years ago. Tellingly, the analysis sustaining these actions by the Court is \u201cas thin as the homeopathic soup that was made by boiling the shadow of a pigeon that had been starved to death.\u201d Abraham Lincoln, Sixth Debate with Stephen A. Douglas, at Quincy, Illinois (Oct. 13, 1858), in <em>The Collected Works of Abraham Lincoln </em>vol. 3, 245, 279 (Roy P. Basler ed., Rutgers University Press 1953).</p>\n<p id=\"b265-4\">\u00b675 Indeed, the Court\u2019s approach here seems to be one of emasculating the rules to accommodate the inability of some in law enforcement and the criminal justice system to comply with them. For instance, some have been chafing under our decision in <em>State v. Reesman, </em>2000 MT 243, 301 Mont. 408, 10 P.3d 83, since it was handed down-but no longer. Although the Court claims that its new approach for assessing search warrant applications only \u201cdeviates slightly\u201d from <em>Reesman, see </em>\u00b6 41, the simple fact is that <em>nothing </em>in the Court\u2019s approach to the search warrant application at issue here conforms to-or even resembles-the step-by-step framework we set forth in <em>Reesman. Compare </em>\u00b6\u00b6 31-37 &amp; 46 of the Court\u2019s Opinion <em>with Reesman, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 28-35. Indeed, the Court\u2019s <em>contra-Reesman </em>approach reflects an outright rejection of that framework, the Court\u2019s assurances notwithstanding.</p>\n<p id=\"AKG\">\u00b676 Likewise, under the Court\u2019s Opinion we now accept a search warrant applicant\u2019s characterization of an informant as a \u201cconcerned <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>citizen\u201d or \u201ccitizen informant\u201d at face value, <em>see </em>\u00b6\u00b6 31, 34, 37, 38, 41, 46. In other words, it no longer is necessary to substantiate such labeling with supporting facts, which is significant given that incriminating information provided by a person who was motivated by good citizenship to report a chance encounter with crime is <em>presumed </em>reliable, <em>see </em>\u00b6 31 of the Court\u2019s Opinion; <em>State v. Valley </em>(1992), 252 Mont. 489, 493, 830 P.2d 1255, 1258; <em>State v. Oleson, </em>1998 MT 130, \u00b6 14, 289 Mont. 139, \u00b6 14, 959 P.2d 503, \u00b6 14, <em>overruled in part on other grounds by Kuneff, </em>\u00b6 19. A similarly helpful outcome of today\u2019s Opinion is that the Court sanctions the use of a blanket, generalized assertion at the end of a search warrant application concerning the reliability of all of the informants mentioned in the application. In the future, all an applicant need do is assure the reviewing magistrate: \u201cThe informants mentioned in this application have given reliable information in the past. All have been proven reliable with corroborating information that resulted in arrests from the information they provided. All of the above informants are separate and apart from each other, and are not aware of the others\u2019 participation.\u201d The tedious task of specifying the particulars supporting such an assurance is no longer required. To be sure, the Court \u201cadmonish[es]\u201d police officers to corroborate independently information from sources of \u201cquestionable reliability,\u201d \u00b6 42; yet, the Court\u2019s resolution of the case at hand makes it clear that in reality, no consequences flow from an officer\u2019s failure to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-4\">\u00b677 While I am not indifferent to the challenges faced by officers engaged in \u201cthe often competitive enterprise of ferreting out crime,\u201d <em>Johnson v. United States </em>(1948), 333 U.S. 10, 14, 68 S.Ct. 367, 369, the simple fact is that we may not vitiate constitutional guarantees simply because they burden evidence gathering practices. <em>See Davis v. Washington </em>(2006), 126 S.Ct. 2266, 2280 (\u201cWe may not . . . vitiate constitutional guarantees when they have the effect of allowing the guilty to go free.\u201d); <em>Mapp v. Ohio </em>(1961), 367 U.S. 643, 648, 81 S.Ct. 1684, 1688 (\u201c \u2018The efforts of the courts and their officials to bring the guilty to punishment, praiseworthy as they are, are not to be aided by the sacrifice of those great principles established by years of endeavor and suffering which have resulted in their embodiment in the fundamental law of the land.\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>Weeks v. United States </em>(1914), 232 U.S. 383, 393, 34 S.Ct. 341, 344)). As a matter of fact, it is precisely to restrain the State\u2019s ability to enter our homes that the constitutional protections against unreasonable searches and seizures exist in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>first place. As Justice Kennedy recently observed in an analogous context,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b267-4\">privacy and security in the home are central to the Fourth Amendment\u2019s guarantees as explained in our decisions and as understood since the beginnings of the Republic. This common understanding ensures respect for the law and allegiance to our institutions, and it is an instrument for transmitting our Constitution to later generations undiminished in meaning and force. It bears repeating that it is a serious matter if law enforcement officers violate the sanctity of the home by ignoring the requisites of lawful entry. Security must not be subject to erosion by indifference or contempt.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b267-5\"><em>Hudson v. Michigan </em>(2006), 126 S.Ct. 2159, 2170 (Kennedy, J., concurring in part and concurring in the judgment).</p>\n<p id=\"b267-6\">\u00b678 Notwithstanding this admonition, the Court today substantially weakens our citizens\u2019 privacy and security in their homes by virtue of the remarkable and extensive transformation in Montana search and seizure law effected by this decision. No longer may we proclaim that Article II, Sections 10 and 11, of the Montana Constitution provide <em>greater </em>protections of individual privacy than are provided by the federal constitution. Rather, the determination of probable cause to issue a search warrant is now completely dependent on the whim of whatever trial and appellate judges happen to be reviewing the application.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-7\">\u00b679 While I agree with Justice Cotter\u2019s well-reasoned and well-written dissenting opinion, I write separately to underscore the cursory nature of the Court\u2019s analysis and the alarming implications of its disposition of Barnaby\u2019s unlawful search claim. Reduced to its essentials, so long as a search warrant application is buoyed by the usual mantra of general platitudes, pretty much anything will hereafter suffice to issue the warrant-stale information, hearsay, informant suspicion, innuendo, guilt by association, and sloppy police work, in complete disregard of this Court\u2019s long-established precedents and proper judicial oversight. This case has it all-and, unfortunately, little else. It is therefore instructive to carefully walk through each of the assertions set forth in the application at issue. Before doing so, however, it is necessary to review fully the law applicable to the assessment of search warrant applications.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-8\">I. The Law of Assessing Search Warrant Applications A. Probable Cause</p>\n<p id=\"b268-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>\u00b680 The Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution provides that \u201cno Warrants shall issue, but upon <em>probable cause, </em>supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.\u201d U.S. Const, amend. IV (emphasis added). Similarly, Article II, Section 11, of the Montana Constitution provides that \u201c[n]o warrant to search any place, or seize any person or thing shall issue without describing the place to be searched or the person or thing to be seized, or without <em>probable cause, </em>supported by oath or affirmation reduced to writing.\u201d Mont.

In other words, \u201cprobable cause is a fluid concept-turning on the assessment of probabilities in particular factual contexts-not readily, or even usefully, reduced to a neat set of legal rules.\u201d <em>Illinois v.

Thus, probable cause exists where the facts and circumstances within the reviewing judicial officer\u2019s knowledge and of which he or she has reasonably trustworthy information are sufficient in themselves to warrant a person of reasonable caution in the belief that an offense has been or is being committed and evidence thereof will be found in the suspected place. <em>Brinegar, </em>338 U.S. at 175-76, 69 S.Ct. at 1311; <em>see also State v.

Its protection consists in requiring that those inferences be drawn by a neutral and detached magistrate instead of being judged by the officer engaged in the often competitive enterprise of ferreting out crime. Any assumption that evidence sufficient to support a magistrate\u2019s disinterested determination to issue a search warrant will justify the officers in making a search without a warrant would reduce the Amendment to a nullity and leave the people\u2019s homes secure only in the discretion of police officers. Crime, even in the privacy of one\u2019s own quarters, is, of course, of grave concern to society, and the law allows such crime to be reached on proper showing. The right of officers to thrust <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>themselves into a home is also a grave concern, not only to the individual but to a society which chooses to dwell in reasonable security and freedom from surveillance. When the right of privacy must reasonably yield to the right of search is, as a rule, to be decided by a judicial officer, not by a policeman or Government enforcement agent.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b270-4\"><em>Johnson, </em>333 U.S. at 13-14, 68 S.Ct. at 369 (footnotes omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b270-5\">B.

Bullock </em>(1995), 272 Mont. 361, 383, 901 P.2d 61, 75. Indeed, our Constitution, unlike its federal counterpart, explicitly ensures Montanans the right to privacy. Specifically, Article II, Section 10, states that \u201c[t]he right of individual privacy is essential to the well-being of a free society and shall not be infringed without the showing of a compelling state interest.\u201d This unique constitutional language affords Montanans a greater right to privacy and, therefore, broader protection than does the Fourth Amendment in cases involving searches of, or seizures from, private property. <em>Bullock, </em>272 Mont. at 384, 901 P.2d at 75; <em>see also State v. Sawyer </em>(1977), 174 Mont. 512, 515, 571 P.2d 1131, 1133, <em>overruled in part on other grounds by State v.

Rather, application of that approach in Montana necessarily involves a more rigorous standard for reviewing an application for search warrant. Although we have not explicitly defined this standard (relative to the federal standard), it is clear from the principles set forth above that the totahty-of-the-circumstances approach under Article II, Sections 10 and 11, incorporates a greater deference to individual privacy interests than does its counterpart under the Fourth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-5\">\u00b689 This greater deference, in turn, influences the balancing of interests that the probable cause concept represents. As explained above, \u201cprobable cause\u201d reflects a compromise between two concededly important, yet often opposing, interests: the individual\u2019s interest in privacy and the community\u2019s interest in the investigation of crime by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>law enforcement. The point at which the former must yield to the latter is the crucial distinction between assessing the totality-of-the-circumstances under Article II, Sections 10 and 11, versus the Fourth Amendment. Under the Fourth Amendment, that point is reached where there is a \u201cfair probability,\u201d based on all of the circumstances set forth in the application, that contraband or evidence of a crime will be found in the place to be searched. <em>Gates, </em>462 U.S. at 238,103 S.Ct. at 2332.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-4\">\u00b690 In adopting the <em>Gates </em>formulation of the totality-of-the-circumstances approach, we also adopted <em>Gates\u2019s </em>\u201cfair probability\u201d standard, <em>see State v. O\u2019Neill </em>(1984), 208 Mont. 386, 394-95, 679 P.2d 760, 764-65; <em>State v. Pierre </em>(1984), 208 Mont. 430, 435, 678 P.2d 650, 653, and we have continued to cite this standard in our totality-of-the-circumstances analyses, <em>see State v. Walston </em>(1989), 236 Mont. 218, 221, 768 P.2d 1387, 1389; <em>State v. Sarbaum </em>(1995), 270 Mont. 176, 184-85, 890 P.2d 1284, 1289-90; <em>State v. Kaluza </em>(1995), 272 Mont. 404, 411, 901 P.2d 107, 112; <em>State v. Marks, </em>2002 MT 255, \u00b6\u00b6 17, 19, 312 Mont. 169, \u00b6\u00b6 17, 19, 59 P.3d 369, \u00b6\u00b6 17, 19; <em>State v.

However, given that Article II, Section 10, provides for a broader right to privacy than does the Fourth Amendment, a heightened level of persuasion is implicit in our applications of the \u201cfair probability\u201d standard. In other words, before the fundamental right of individual privacy<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> will give way to the interest in investigation of criminal activity, the factual assertions set forth in the warrant application must be more stringently buttressed (in the manner explained below in Part I-C) than the Fourth Amendment requires, such that the reviewing judicial officer has a concrete and independent sense that contraband or evidence of a crime will be found in the place to be searched.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-5\">C. The Role of Veracity, Reliability, Basis of Knowledge, and Independent Corroboration in the Totality-of-the-Circumstances Approach</p>\n<p id=\"b272-6\">\u00b691 Significantly, the \u201ctwo-pronged test\u201d set forth in <em>Aguilar v. Texas, supra, </em>and later refined in <em>Spinelli v. United States, supra, </em>was originally \u201cintended simply as guides to a magistrate\u2019s determination of probable cause, not as inflexible, independent requirements <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>applicable in every case.\u201d <em>Gates, </em>462 U.S. at 230 n.6, 103 S.Ct. at 2328 n.6. As the Court explained,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b273-4\">[i]n <em>Aguilar, </em>we required only that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b273-5\">\u201cthe magistrate must be informed of <em>some of the underlying circumstances </em>from which the informant concluded that . . . narcotics were where he claimed they were, and <em>some of the underlying circumstances </em>from which the officer concluded that the informant . . . was \u2018credible\u2019 or his information \u2018reliable.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b273-6\">As our language indicates, we intended neither a rigid compartmentalization of the inquiries into an informant\u2019s \u201cveracity,\u201d \u201creliability,\u201d and \u201cbasis of knowledge,\u201d nor that these inquiries be elaborate exegeses of an informant\u2019s tip. Rather, we required only that <em>some </em>facts bearing on two particular issues be provided to the magistrate.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b273-7\"><em>Gates, </em>462 U.S. at 230 n.6, 103 S.Ct. at 2328 n.6 (ellipses in original, citation omitted). This requirement still exists under the totality-of-the-circumstances approach as defined in <em>Gates.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b273-8\">\u00b692 Indeed, although the Supreme Court rejected <em>Aguilar-SpinellVs </em>\u201ctwo-pronged test,\u201d it did not reject the requirement set forth in those cases that a judicial officer, in assessing an application for a search warrant, be able to evaluate (from the information provided in the application) an informant\u2019s veracity, reliability, and basis of knowledge. <em>Gates, </em>462 U.S. at 238-39, 103 S.Ct. at 2332-33. To the contrary, the Court stated that \u201can informant\u2019s \u2018veracity,\u2019 \u2018reliability,\u2019 and \u2018basis of knowledge\u2019 are all highly relevant in determining the value of his report.\u201d <em>Gates, </em>462 U.S. at 230, 103 S.Ct. at 2328. Accordingly, the totality-of-the-circumstances approach itself incorporates this requirement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b273-9\">The task of the issuing magistrate is simply to make a practical, common-sense decision whether, given all the circumstances set forth in the affidavit before him, <em>including the \u201cveracity\u201d and \u201cbasis of knowledge\u201d of persons supplying hearsay information, </em>there is a fair probability that contraband or evidence of a crime will be found in a particular place.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b273-10\"><em>Gates, </em>462 U.S. at 238, 103 S.Ct. at 2332 (emphasis added); <em>see also State v.

Likewise, if an unquestionably honest citizen comes forward with a report of criminal activity-which if fabricated would subj ect him to criminal liability-we have found rigorous scrutiny of the basis of his knowledge unnecessary. Conversely, even if we entertain some doubt as to an informant\u2019s motives, his explicit and detailed description of alleged wrongdoing, along with a statement that the event was observed firsthand, entitles his tip to <em>greater weight </em>than might otherwise be the case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b274-6\"><em>Gates, </em>462 U.S. at 233-34, 103 S.Ct. at 2329-30 (emphases added, citations and footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b274-7\">\u00b694 Furthermore, in addition to the informant\u2019s veracity and basis of knowledge, the reliability of his information may be demonstrated through independent corroboration. Indeed, the Court noted that its decisions applying the totality-of-the-circumstances approach \u201chave <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>consistently recognized the value of corroboration of details of an informant\u2019s tip by independent police work.\u201d <em>Gates, </em>462 U.S. at 241, 103 S.Ct. at 2334. Independent corroboration may even resurrect a tip that otherwise could not be afforded any weight in the totality-of-the-circumstances analysis. <em>See Gates, </em>462 U.S. at 242-43 &amp; n.12, 103 S.Ct. at 2334 &amp; n.12 (discussing the corroborative efforts of police officers in <em>Draper v. United States </em>(1959), 358 U.S. 307, 79 S.Ct. 329). Thus, while the anonymous letter sent to the police department in Gates<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> was, standing alone, insufficient to establish probable cause to believe that contraband would be found in the Gateses\u2019 car and home, <em>Gates, </em>462 U.S. at 227, 103 S.Ct. at 2326, the independent investigation conducted by the police-which itself suggested that the Gateses were involved in drug trafficking, <em>Gates, </em>462 U.S. at 243, 103 S.Ct. at 2335-enabled the reviewing judge to rely on the letter in making the probable cause determination, <em>Gates, </em>462 U.S. at 243-44, 103 S.Ct. at 2335.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-4\">\u00b695 In sum, what the Supreme Court modified in <em>Gates </em>was not the requirement that an informant\u2019s tip be accompanied by some indicia of reliability (e.g., facts bearing on the informant\u2019s veracity and basis of knowledge, and/or details of independent investigative or corroborative efforts); rather, it was the <em>manner </em>in which a magistrate assesses that tip. No longer does the magistrate conduct \u201can excessively technical dissection of informants\u2019 tips, with undue attention . . . focused on isolated issues that cannot sensibly be divorced from the other facts presented.\u201d <em>Gates, </em>462 U.S. at 234-35, 103 S.Ct. at 2330 (footnote omitted). Instead, the magistrate carries <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>out \u201ca balanced assessment of the relative weights of <em>all </em>the various indicia of reliability (and unreliability) attending an informant\u2019s tip.\u201d <em>Gates, </em>462 U.S. at 234, 103 S.Ct. at 2330 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b276-4\">\u00b696 This distinction \u2014 one which we previously recognized in <em>Adams, Rinehart, Crowder, </em>and <em>Seaman, </em>but which has eluded the Court in this case-is crucial to a proper understanding of the totality-of-the-circumstances approach.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-5\">[P]robable cause can[not] be made out by affidavits which are purely conclusory, stating only the affiant\u2019s or an informer\u2019s belief that probable cause exists without detailing any of the \u201cunderlying circumstances\u201d upon which that belief is based. Recital of some of the underlying circumstances in the affidavit is essential if the magistrate is to perform his detached function and not serve merely as a rubber stamp for the police.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b276-6\"><em>United States v.

Thus, it is not sufficient that the information set forth in a warrant application would, <em>if taken as true, </em>establish probable cause. Nor is it sufficient that the application contains a number of similar or identical assertions by multiple informants whose reliability is unknown. <em>See State v. Valley </em>(1992), 252 Mont. 489, 493, 830 P.2d 1255, 1258 (\u201cIn determining probability, it is not the number of statements, tips or events that is determinative relative to the common sense approach, it is the probative force of one, some or all of them.

In other words, he must set forth facts from which the reviewing judicial officer can assess the reliability of the various assertions in the application, mindful of the heightened level of persuasion required by Article II, Sections 10 and 11. <em>See State v. Griffin, </em>2004 MT 331, \u00b6 23, 324 Mont. 143, \u00b6 23, 102 P.3d 1206, \u00b6 23 (\u201c \u2018Amere affirmance of belief or suspicion by a police officer, absent any underlying facts or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>circumstances, does not establish probable cause for the issuance of a search warrant.\u2019\u201d(quoting State v.

The judicial officer should not be left to guess as to why the applicant considers a person cited in the application and her information to be reliable. There must be facts bearing on the veracity and/or basis of knowledge of this person, or details of any steps taken by the applicant to corroborate her information. Otherwise, the judicial officer is unable to credit her tip; at best, her information is of little weight in the overall probable cause assessment.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-4\">D. <em>Reesman </em>and Establishing the Reliability of Informants\u2019 Information</p>\n<p id=\"b277-6\">\u00b698 To a large extent, probable cause determinations are subjective-as epitomized by the approach utilized by the Court in this case. Hence, consistent with the Supreme Court\u2019s purpose in <em>Aguilar, </em>this Court over the years has adopted a variety of rules to guide probable cause determinations and the assessment of the reliability of information provided by informants-mindful of the requirement that a more persuasive quantum of facts must be provided to the reviewing judicial officer under the heightened totality-of-the-circumstances standard mandated by Article II, Sections 10 and 11. Six years ago, noting that this case law had \u201cas a whole create[d] an appearance of convolution,\u201d <em>Reesman, </em>\u00b6 26, we pulled together in one place extant precedent and unambiguously articulated a step-by-step process for assessing under the totahty-of-the-circumstances approach the probative value of different types of information set forth in search warrant applications, <em>see Reesman, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 24-48.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-7\">\u00b699 Importantly, <em>Reesman </em>did not establish any new law. Nor did it impose any new obligations on police, prosecutors, or judges. Rather, the opinion merely collected the rules that this Court had adopted in numerous search and seizure cases and presented them in what might be described as \u201ccookbook fashion.\u201d For this reason, the majority\u2019s mere lip service to the <em>Reesman </em>framework implicates not only that one decision, but also the extensive jurisprudence developed before (and after) <em>Reesman.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b277-8\">\u00b6100 Furthermore, nothing <em>inReesman </em>signifies a return to the days of inflexible multi-pronged tests or \u201cstrict rules,\u201d notwithstanding the Court\u2019s inability to \u201ceasily reconcile\u201d <em>Reesman </em>with the totality-of-the-circumstances approach, \u00b6 41. To the contrary, we specifically acknowledged that \u201c[the] \u2018totality of the circumstances approach\u2019 by design resists \u2018any rigid demand that <em>specific tests </em>be satisfied by every <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>informant\u2019s tip.\u2019 \u201d <em>Reesman, </em>\u00b6 27. At the same time, however, we observed that, \u201cbased on 17 years of precedent laid down by this Court since we adopted the <em>Gates </em>test. .., certain indelible threshold rules have emerged. In turn, these rules may be merged into a fairly coherent step-by-step analysis for determining whether an informant\u2019s information is sufficient to establish probable cause.\u201d <em>Reesman, </em>\u00b6 27. \u00b6101 Accordingly, <em>Reesman </em>represents both a reaffirmation of the totality-of-the-circumstances approach-an approach every Member of this Court presently agrees is the proper method for assessing whether probable cause exists to issue a search warrant-and our recognition that sufficient facts bearing on an informant\u2019s veracity and basis of knowledge must be provided to the reviewing judicial officer so that he or she is able to make a conscientious and informed probable cause determination under the heightened standard required by Article II, Sections 10 and 11. To this end, we synthesized from our case law the following principles.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-4\">\u00b6102 1. If the informant is anonymous, then independent corroboration of his or her information is required. <em>Reesman, </em>\u00b6 28 &amp; n.l (citing <em>State v. Rinehart </em>(1993), <em>262 </em>Mont. 204, 211-12, 864 P.2d 1219, 1223-24; <em>State v. Valley (1992), </em>252 Mont. 489, 493, 830 P.2d 1255, 1257; <em>State v. Worrall, </em>1999 MT 55, \u00b6 22, 293 Mont. 439, \u00b6 22, 976 P.2d 968, \u00b6 22; <em>State v. Adams </em>(1997), 284 Mont. 25, 37, 943 P.2d 955, 962). This is not to say that a warrant application necessarily fails to establish probable cause if it contains uncorroborated information provided by an anonymous informant. Rather, it is, in essence, a statement of the obvious: such information is entitled to little, if any, weight in the probable cause determination, since a reviewing judicial officer cannot make \u201ca conscientious assessment of the basis for crediting such [a tip],\u201d <em>Gates, </em>462 U.S. at 238, 103 S.Ct. at 2332, when no indicia of reliability whatsoever attend it.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-6\">\u00b6103 Indeed, the Supreme Court had this to say about the anonymous letter sent to the police department in <em>Gates:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b278-7\">The Illinois Supreme Court concluded-and we are inclined to agree-that, standing alone, the anonymous letter . . . would not provide the basis for a magistrate\u2019s determination that there was probable cause to believe contraband would be found in the Gateses\u2019 car and home. The letter provides virtually nothing from which one might conclude that its author is either honest or his information reliable; likewise, the letter gives absolutely no indication of the basis for the writer\u2019s predictions regarding the Gateses\u2019 criminal activities. Something more was required, then, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>before a magistrate could conclude that there was probable cause to believe that contraband would be found in the Gateses\u2019 home and car.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b279-4\"><em>Gates, </em>462 U.S. at 227, 103 S.Ct. at 2326. As discussed earlier, the Court ultimately concluded that because of the investigating detective\u2019s efforts in corroborating the details set forth in the letter, the magistrate could reasonably rely on the letter in the probable cause determination. <em>See Gates, </em>462 U.S. at 243-45, 246, 103 S.Ct. at 2335-36. The Court explained that while the honesty and reliability of the anonymous informant were indeed unknown to the police at the time they received the letter, this fact \u201cbecame far less significant after [the detective\u2019s] independent investigative work occurred.\u201d <em>Gates, </em>462 U.S. at 244, 103 S.Ct. at 2335.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-5\">\u00b6104 2. If the informant is not anonymous, is his or her information based on his or her personal observation of the described criminal activity (as opposed to hearsay)? If not, then independent corroboration of the informant\u2019s information is required. <em>Reesman, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 29-30 (citing <em>Rinehart, </em>262 Mont. at 212, 864 P.2d at 1224; <em>State v.

Again, nothing about this second inquiry is novel or \u201cimpractical.\u201d It is merely another statement of the obvious: there is little or no basis for crediting hearsay provided by a non-anonymous informant when no other indicia of reliability-such as the informant\u2019s veracity or the officer\u2019s independent corroboration-attend the tip. But if the informant\u2019s veracity is established in the application (e.g., through independent corroboration or prior dealings), then his or her information may be credited. <em>See, e.g., Gates, </em>462 U.S. at 233, 103 S.Ct. at 2329-30 (\u201cIf, for example, a particular informant is known for the unusual reliability of his predictions of certain types of criminal activities in a locality, his failure, in a particular case, to thoroughly set forth the basis of his knowledge surely should not serve as an absolute bar to a finding of probable cause based on his tip.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b279-7\">\u00b6105 3. If the informant is not anonymous and if his or her information was gleaned from personal observations, is he or she a rehable source of such information? If not, then independent corroboration of the informant\u2019s information is required. <em>Reesman, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 31-35 (citing <em>Kaluza, </em>272 Mont. at 410, 901 P.2d at 111; <em>Rinehart, </em>262 Mont. at 212, 864 P.2d at 1223-24; <em>State v.

(Obviously, there is no basis for treating a person as one of these three types of informants when no supporting facts are set forth in the application. Nevertheless, the Court blindly accepts such labeling in the case at hand, <em>see </em>\u00b6\u00b6 31, 32, 34, 37, 38, 41, 46, thereby signaling that we now accept the labels \u201cconcerned citizen\u201d and \u201ccitizen informant\u201d without question.)</p>\n<p id=\"b280-5\">\u00b6 107 However, in stating that independent corroboration is required for information that does not fall within one of these three categories, <em>see Reesman, </em>\u00b6 35, we did not mean that other indicia of reliability could not compensate for the deficiency in the informant\u2019s reliability. Rather, we were simply acknowledging that personal observations relayed to an officer by a non-anonymous informant of unknown reliability are entitled to relatively less weight when no other indicia of reliability-such as independent corroboration-attend the tip. <em>See, e.g., Gates, </em>462 U.S. at 234, 103 S.Ct. at 2330 (\u201c[E]ven if we entertain some doubt as to an informant\u2019s motives, his explicit and detailed description of alleged wrongdoing, along with a statement that the event was observed firsthand, entitles his tip to greater weight than might otherwise be the case.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b280-6\">\u00b6108 Thus, <em>Reesman </em>did <em>not </em>create a rigid, multi-pronged test or \u201cstrict rules,\u201d the Court\u2019s Opinion notwithstanding. To the contrary, the decision is, as described above, essentially a cookbook, indicating to law enforcement whether a given informant\u2019s information is sufficient, without independent corroboration or investigation, to establish probable cause. <em>See Reesman, </em>\u00b6 27. If the informant is anonymous, little-if any-weight can be given his or her tip absent independent corroboration. The same is true of non-anonymous informants whose veracity or basis of knowledge are not established <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>in the warrant application. This conclusion is mandated not only under the minimal standard set forth by the Fourth Amendment, see <em>Gates, </em>462 U.S. at 227, 103 S.Ct. at 2326, but also by the higher standard mandated by Article II, Section 10, <em>see Bullock, </em>272 Mont. at 383-84, 901 P.2d at 75.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-4\">\u00b6109 To be sure, a finding that an informant lacks veracity or that his or her basis of knowledge is unknown or wanting is not fatal to establishing probable cause, since other indicia of reliability (whether related to the particular informant or to the application as a whole) may supply the necessary basis for a finding of probable cause. <em>Gates, </em>462 U.S. at 233, 103 S.Ct. at 2329. But at a minimum, \u201c[sufficient information must be presented to the magistrate to allow that official to determine probable cause; his action cannot be a mere ratification of the bare conclusions of others.\u201d <em>Gates, </em>462 U.S. at 239, 103 S.Ct. at 2333; <em>see also State v. Olson </em>(1979), 180 Mont. 151, 154, 589 P.2d 663, 665 (\u201c[T]he magistrate must base his finding upon <em>competent evidence </em>sufficient to enable the magistrate to form <em>his own independent conclusion\u201d) </em>(first emphasis in original, second emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b281-5\">\u00b6110 With that, I now turn to the actual search warrant application.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-6\">II. Analysis of the Search Warrant Application at Issue</p>\n<p id=\"b281-7\">A. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b281-8\">\u00b6111 On February 11, 2002, Flathead Tribal Police Narcotics Investigator Louis J. Fiddler (\u201cFiddler\u201d) presented District Judge McNeil with a sworn Application for Search Warrant to search \u201cthe residence, outbuildings, and numerous junk vehicles\u201d located on property owned by Barnaby. Fiddler alleged that evidence of the crimes of criminal possession of dangerous drugs and criminal production or manufacture of dangerous drugs would be found at this location.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-9\">\u00b6112 In support of his application, Fiddler set forth fourteen factual assertions, all but three of which regarded the activities of June Malatare-Sheridan (\u201cSheridan\u201d). Based on these assertions, Judge McNeil concluded that \u201cthere is probable cause to believe that evidence of a crime is located in the residence, outbuildings, and numerous junk vehicles\u201d on Barnaby\u2019s property. Accordingly, on February 11,2002, he issued a warrant \u201cto search said premises [and Sheridan\u2019s car],\u201d which Fiddler executed on February 13, 2002. Thereafter, Barnaby and Sheridan were both charged with operation of an unlawful clandestine laboratory, in violation of \u00a7 45-9-132(1), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-10\">\u00b6113 On May 23, 2003, Sheridan filed a motion, in which Barnaby later joined, to suppress the evidence seized by Fiddler on the ground <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>that Fiddler\u2019s application \u201cfail[ed] to establish probable cause for the issuance of the search warrant in this case.\u201d Addressing each assertion set forth in the application in turn, Sheridan noted that the first few assertions were \u201cnot relevant\u201d to the search of Barnaby\u2019s home and that most of the remaining assertions were, in substance, \u201cmere conclusory statements lacking factual support.\u201d For instance, with respect to the tips provided by informants who Fiddler labeled as \u201cconcerned citizen[s],\u201d Sheridan pointed out that while a concerned citizen is presumed rehable, such reliability \u201cis generally shown by the very nature of the circumstances under which the incriminating information became known\u201d (citing <em>State v. Siegal </em>(1997), 281 Mont. 250, 281, 934 P.2d 176, 194); yet, Fiddler\u2019s application \u201cstates absolutely no circumstances or facts as to how the \u2018incriminating information\u2019 became known by the citizen informant[s].\u201d Similarly, she observed that information provided by several other informants referenced in the application was \u201csheer speculation\u201d and that there was \u201cno factual basis\u201d for crediting this information. Lastly, having recognized that one of the tips \u201ctends to show some propensity for criminal activity on the part of Sheridan,\u201d she reminded the court that \u201c[plrobable cause must exist for the search of the particular location for which the search warrant is obtained. Pursuant to [State <em>v. Kaluza </em>(1995), 272 Mont. 404, 901 P.2d 107], probable cause to believe that <em>an </em>offense has been committed by a suspect is a separate question from whether probable cause exists to search a particular residence.\u201d In conclusion, she argued that the conclusory and speculative statements, taken together with the other information in the application, \u201cdid not establish the existence of a fair probability that evidence related to a crime would be found at the \u2018Barnaby residence.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b282-4\">\u00b6114 The State, in response, maintained that \u201cthe reliability of each of the informants is established.\u201d First, the State argued that by virtue of Fiddler\u2019s assertion (near the end of his application) that each of the informants named in the application has given reliable information in the past, \u201c[n]o further corroboration [was] necessary.\u201d Second, the State cited the presumption of reliability accorded information provided by \u201cconcerned citizens.\u201d Third, with respect to the two informants who had reported that Sheridan was manufacturing methamphetamine at Barnaby\u2019s residence, the State-conceding that \u201cthe source of their information is not known\u201d-suggested that their information was corroborated by a third informant who reported \u201cunusual activity\u2019 at Barnaby\u2019s residence. Lastly, the State asserted that \u201c[p]olice surveillance indicated that . . . [Sheridan\u2019s] car was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>located [at Bamaby\u2019s residence],\u201d though no such police surveillance is referenced within the four corners of Fiddler\u2019s application.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-4\">\u00b6115 Following a hearing on September 12, 2003, District Judge Christopher denied Sheridan and Bamaby\u2019s motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-5\">B. The Individual Factual Assertions in Fiddler\u2019s</p>\n<p id=\"b283-6\">Application</p>\n<p id=\"b283-7\">\u00b6116 The inadequacy of Fiddler\u2019s search warrant application is camouflaged by the numerosity of provocative, yet unsupported assertions set forth therein, as though insufficient data is strengthened by number and repetition. In order to properly analyze the totality of his application, it is necessary first to assess the probative value of the individual pieces of information. In this regard, we have occasionally said that in analyzing an application for search warrant, we do not look at each individual fact presented in the application, but rather at the totality of the circumstances. <em>See, e.g., State v. Morse, </em>2006 MT 54, \u00b6 12, 331 Mont. 300, \u00b6 12, 132 P.3d 528, \u00b6 12; <em>State v. Beaupre, </em>2004 MT 300, \u00b6 37, 323 Mont. 413, \u00b6 37, 102 P.3d 504, \u00b6 37; <em>State v. Bowman, </em>2004 MT 119, \u00b6 29, 321 Mont. 176, \u00b6 29, 89 P.3d 986, \u00b6 29. This is a slight misstatement of our approach. In <em>State v. St. Marks, </em>2002 MT 285, 312 Mont. 468, 59 P.3d 1113, to which Morse (indirectly), <em>Beaupre </em>(directly), and <em>Bowman </em>(directly) cite, we explained that \u201c[w]hen assessing a search warrant application, \u2018[t]he test is not to determine whether each individual fact presented in the application for search warrant establishes probable cause, but to determine from the totality of the circumstances whether there is probable cause.\u2019 \u201d <em>St. Marks, </em>\u00b6 22 (second alteration in original) (quoting <em>State v. Kuneff, </em>1998 MT 287, \u00b6 27, 291 Mont. 474, \u00b6 27, 970 P.2d 556, \u00b6 27, in turn citing <em>Gates, </em>462 U.S. at 238, 103 S.Ct. at 2332). In other words, a deficiency in one individual factual assertion is not necessarily fatal to a finding of probable cause, since other facts presented in the application may compensate for that deficiency.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-8\">\u00b6117 This is not to say, however, that we do not look at each individual fact set forth in the application. Obviously, the totality of the circumstances cannot be assessed without first analyzing the probative value of the various facts that make up the totality. Indeed, the totality-of-the-circumstances approach contemplates \u201ca balanced assessment of the relative weights\u201d of all the facts presented in the application. <em>Gates, </em>462 U.S. at 234, 103 S.Ct. at 2330; <em>see also State v. Gray, </em>2001 MT 250, \u00b6 13, 307 Mont. 124, \u00b6 13, 38 P.3d 775, \u00b6 13 (Under the totality-of-the-circumstances approach, \u201cthe judge evaluates <em>the facts </em>asserted within the four corners of the application <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>and makes a practical, common-sense decision as to whether there is a fair probability that incriminating items will be found in the place to which entry is sought.\u201d (emphasis added)). Thus, each of Fiddler\u2019s fourteen factual assertions, which are numbered below for ease of reference, will be analyzed sequentially to determine its relative weight in the totality of the circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-4\">\u00b6118 As a framework for this discussion, it is helpful to sketch the general propositions for which Fiddler\u2019s assertions apparently were offered:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b284-5\">\u2022 Farren Galpin knows how to manufacture methamphetamine, and he taught Cl# 14 and Cory Minez how to do so (Assertions 1, 2, and 3).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b284-6\">\u2022 Galpin also taught Sheridan, whom he once dated, how to manufacture methamphetamine (Assertions 3 and 4).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b284-7\">\u2022 Sheridan has acquired ingredients and possessed apparatus consistent with the manufacture of methamphetamine (Assertions 5, 6, 7, 11, and 12).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b284-8\">\u2022 Sheridan has engaged in the manufacture of methamphetamine (Assertions 6, 8, 9, 10, and 12).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b284-9\">\u2022 Since at least November 7, 2001, Sheridan has resided at least part-time at Barnaby\u2019s residence (Assertions 8 and 9).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b284-10\">\u2022 Sheridan has operated a methamphetamine lab at Barnaby\u2019s residence and at another location (Assertions 9 and 10, and inferences from Assertion 13).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b284-11\">\u2022 There presently (February 11, 2002) are ingredients and apparatus associated with the production of methamphetamine in \u201cthe residence, outbuildings, and numerous junk vehicles\u201d on Barnaby\u2019s property (inferences from Assertions 9,10, and 13).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b284-12\">\u2022 The persons who supplied this information are reliable and their information is reliable (Assertion 14).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b284-13\">\u00b6119 Assertions 1 and 2. On February 22, 2000, Lt. Les Clairmont (\u201cClairmont\u201d) interviewed \u201cCI#14,\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> who stated that he had been taught how to manufacture methamphetamine by one Farren Galpin (\u201cGalpin\u201d) in August 1999. On February 24,2000, during an interview with Clairmont, Fiddler, and Investigator C. Couture (\u201cCouture\u201d), CI#14 reaffirmed that Galpin had taught him how to manufacture meth. CI#14 also disclosed that Galpin had taught one Cory Minez (\u201cMinez\u201d) how to manufacture meth. CI#14 offered to take Fiddler and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>Couture to the locations (which Fiddler listed in the application) where Galpin had been manufacturing meth and storing his meth labs, and he apparently disclosed that he had \u201cpersonally observed\u201d the meth labs at these locations. During the interview, CI#14 \u201cspoke very freely\u201d about producing methamphetamine, and he evinced extensive knowledge about the process.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-4\">\u00b6120 Analysis: Why should the reviewing judge believe CI#14\u2019s information? We have held that a reviewing judicial officer cannot just assume that an informant is credible; rather, the applicant must provide a basis for such a finding-e.g., a sworn statement by the applicant that the specific informant has given rehable and accurate information in the past, or independent corroboration of the informant\u2019s current information. <em>See Reesman, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 29-32, 35; <em>State v. Kaluza </em>(1995), 272 Mont. 404, 410, 411, 901 P.2d 107, 111; <em>State v. Wilson </em>(1992), 254 Mont. 317, 319, 837 P.2d 1346, 1347; <em>State v. Walston </em>(1989), 236 Mont. 218, 222-23, 768 P.2d 1387, 1390. Here, Fiddler provided no facts whatsoever concerning CI#14\u2019s veracity. Granted, CI#14 offered to take Couture and Fiddler to the locations where Galpin had been manufacturing meth and storing his meth labs, and CI#14 indicated that he had \u201cpersonally observed\u201d the labs at these locations; however, we are not told whether Fiddler and/or Couture actually went to these locations and, if so, what they found there.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-5\">\u00b6121 Fiddler did assert, in what seems to be an afterthought near the end of his application (Assertion 14), that \u201c[t]he informants mentioned in this application have given reliable information in the past\u201d and that \u201c[a]ll have been proven reliable with corroborating information that resulted in arrests from the information they provided.\u201d This catchall, however, is of dubious value, as discussed in detail below. But even assuming CI#14\u2019s information was reliable, the fact that Galpin had taught CI#14 and Minez how to manufacture meth had absolutely no bearing on the search of Barnaby\u2019s home and property. Thus, his information was entitled to no weight in the probable cause analysis as it pertained to Barnaby\u2019s residence.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b286-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>\u00b6122 Assertion 3. On March 10, 2000, Minez was arrested for production of methamphetamine. During an interview with Fiddler and Couture, Minez disclosed that he had been taught how to manufacture meth by Galpin and that Galpin had also taught Sheridan how to manufacture meth. In addition, Minez stated that \u201cthere was a time\u201d when Sheridan and Galpin were dating.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-4\">\u00b6123 Analysis: As with the information provided by CI#14, Fiddler provided no facts bearing on Minez\u2019s veracity. Granted, Minez\u2019s admission that Galpin had taught him how to manufacture meth is an indicator of reliability with respect to Minez\u2019s own criminal activities, given that he had been arrested for meth production, <em>see Reesman, </em>\u00b6 33 (discussing admissions against interest); however, this is not a basis on which to presume the reliability of Minez\u2019s information concerning Sheridan\u2019s meth-cooking education and her relationship with Galpin (which, from what appears in the application, was unrelated to Minez\u2019s activities). How did Minez know that Galpin had taught Sheridan how to manufacture meth? How did he know that Galpin and Sheridan had dated? There are no facts in the application indicating how Minez came by this information. Nor are there any facts indicating why Fiddler found Minez\u2019s information to be reliable. (Again, the catchall afterthought in Assertion 14 will be discussed in more detail below.) Thus, Minez\u2019s information was entitled to little weight in the probable cause analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-5\">\u00b6124 Assertion 4. In July 2000, Couture was contacted by a \u201cconcerned citizen\u201d who reported, based on \u201cfirst hand knowledge and personal observations,\u201d that Sheridan had been dating Galpin and that Galpin had taught Sheridan how to manufacture meth. Fiddler notes here that \u201cGalpin is currently serving an extensive sentence after having been convicted of the production of Methamphetamine.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b286-6\">\u00b6125 Analysis: Here, we are presented with what appears to be a non-anonymous informant providing firsthand information, the reliability of which is based on the informant\u2019s status as a \u201cconcerned citizen.\u201d We have distinguished \u201cthe concerned citizen who reports a chance encounter with crime as a civic duty\u201d from \u201cthe confidential informant who works with police by reporting on the illegal activities of others.\u201d <em>State v. Martinez, </em>2003 MT 65, \u00b6 34, 314 Mont. 434, \u00b6 34, 67 P.3d 207, \u00b6 34. We have also stated that an informant who was \u201cmotivated by \u2018good citizenship\u2019 \u201d to disclose incriminating information <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>is presumed reliable, see <em>Reesman, </em>\u00b6 34, whereas other informants enjoy no such presumption of veracity, <em>see Reesman, </em>\u00b6 32.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-4\">\u00b6126 However, in order to ascertain whether a person was motivated by \u201cgood citizenship\u201d-and, thus, may be deemed a \u201cconcerned citizen\u201d-the nature of the circumstances under which she came by the incriminating information must be set forth in the application. <em>State v. Beaupre, </em>2004 MT 300, \u00b6 43, 323 Mont. 413, \u00b6 43, 102 P.3d 504, \u00b6 43; <em>State v. Olson, </em>2003 MT 61, \u00b6 27, 314 Mont. 402, \u00b6 27, 66 P.3d 297, \u00b6 27; <em>Reesman, </em>\u00b6 34; <em>State v. Valley </em>(1992), 252 Mont. 489, 493, 830 P.2d 1255, 1258. In other words, simply labeling a person a \u201cconcerned citizen\u201d does not determine the true nature of that person or the type of scrutiny that must be imposed on her and her information by the reviewing court. <em>See Reesman, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 32, 34.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-5\">\u00b6127 Here, the only indicator that this informant may have been motivated by good citizenship is the \u201cconcerned citizen\u201d label assigned to him/her by Fiddler. Yet, Fiddler divulged no factual basis for his labeling this person as such, and the circumstances under which this person came by his/her information suggests that he/she was <em>not </em>a \u201cconcerned citizen\u201d at all. Specifically, it is highly suspect that this informant had such intimate knowledge of Sheridan\u2019s meth-cooking education and her personal relationship with Galpin. One cannot help but question whether \u201ca chance encounter with crime\u201d really was the source of his/her \u201cfirst hand knowledge and personal observations.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AHG\">\u00b6128 Fiddler created further ambiguity as to the status of this informant through his arbitrary use of labels throughout his application. For instance, he assigned the \u201cconcerned citizen\u201d label to the informants referenced in Assertions 4, 9, and 13, but in Assertion 13, he used the label \u201cconcerned citizen\u201d interchangeably with the label \u201ccitizen informant,\u201d and he assigned this latter term to the informants referenced in Assertions 6 and 10. Of course, it is possible that Fiddler intended both \u201cconcerned citizen\u201d and \u201ccitizen informant\u201d to mean a person who was motivated by good citizenship to disclose incriminating information gleaned from a chance encounter with crime. Indeed, we have used the term \u201ccitizen informant\u201d to refer to such a person, <em>see Valley, </em>252 Mont. at 493, 830 P.2d at 1258, and the Court proceeds under this assumption in the case at hand, <em>see </em>\u00b6 8. The problem, however, is that Fiddler provided no factual support in the application for either label, and his catchall in Assertion 14 suggests that the persons labeled as \u201cconcerned citizen\u201d or \u201ccitizen informant\u201d are neither.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>\u00b6129 Specifically, Fiddler states in Assertion 14 that \u201c[t]he informants mentioned in this application have given reliable information in the past\u201d and \u201c[a]ll have been proven reliable with corroborating information that resulted in arrests from the information they provided.\u201d It is not clear whether \u201c[t]he informants mentioned in this application\u201d encompasses the \u201cconcerned citizens\u201d and \u201ccitizen informants\u201d referenced in Assertions 4, 6, 9, 10, and 13; but if it does, then it seems all the more likely, in light of what Fiddler states in Assertion 14, that these persons were informants \u201cwho work[ed] with police by reporting on the illegal activities of others,\u201d not citizens \u201cwho reported] .. . chance encounters] with crime as a civic duty,\u201d <em>Martinez, </em>\u00b6 34. In any event, a determination of probable cause cannot rest on the reviewing judicial officer\u2019s indulgence in assumptions concerning the accuracy of the search warrant applicant\u2019s labeling-particularly where the label used implicates a <em>presumption </em>of reliability.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-4\">\u00b6130 Thus, given Fiddler\u2019s ambiguous use of the label \u201cconcerned citizen,\u201d as well as the glaring lack of facts from which a magistrate could conclude that the informant cited in Assertion 4 (and the informants cited in Assertions 6, 9, 10, and 13, for that matter) was indeed \u201cmotivated by good citizenship\u201d to disclose information he/she had learned from \u201ca chance encounter with crime,\u201d crediting this person\u2019s information as reliable would be wholly unwarranted, absent other indicia of reliability. Indeed, it would be a mere ratification of Fiddler\u2019s unsubstantiated labeling, something neither the Fourth Amendment nor Article II, Sections 10 and 11, tolerates.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-5\">\u00b6131 Assertion 5. On May 18, 2001, Sheridan was detained for shoplifting suphedrine tablets at a Target store in Missoula. During his investigation, Officer Brester of the Missoula City Police Department spoke with employee Micah Morris, who explained the circumstances under which he had detained Sheridan and stated that he suspected Sheridan of stealing suphedrine tablets on other occasions. Sheridan, in response to questioning by Officer Brester, admitted to removing five boxes of suphedrine tablets on this date and to taking additional boxes of suphedrine tablets from Target on other occasions.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-6\">\u00b6132 Analysis: Given Sheridan\u2019s admission against interest, this tip is reliable. <em>See Reesman, </em>\u00b6 33.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-7\">\u00b6133 Assertion 6. On July 18, 2001, Fiddler spoke with a \u201ccitizen informant\u201d who had been \u201cinvolved\u201d with Sheridan. The informant disclosed that he had found on his property a box labeled \u201cJune\u2019s Stuff\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>and that inside this box he had found acetone, red devil lye, toluene, coffee filters, and several hot plates (all of which, Fiddler notes, \u201care consistent with the production of Methamphetamine\u201d). The informant also reported that in the period of time that Sheridan had lived on his property, he had found \u201cthat the white paint inside [his] closet had gotten a slight brown tint to it and that the carpet in one of the corners was stained.\u201d (Fiddler notes here that it is \u201ccommon in the production of Methamphetamine to stain materials brown (iodine).\u201d) Finally, the informant told Fiddler that he recalled having found empty suphedrine boxes in Sheridan\u2019s vehicle and that he suspected that Sheridan \u201cis concealing items used to produce Methamphetamine in her vehicle\u2019s trunk\u201d since \u201cshe would never let him any where close to the vehicle\u2019s trunk.\u201d From what the informant \u201chad heard about the production of Methamphetamine he believed that [Sheridan] had been involved with the production of the drug.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b289-4\">\u00b6134 Analysis: Whether this person is supposed to be a \u201cconcerned citizen\u201d or a \u201cconfidential informant\u201d-an important distinction, as just discussed, since reliability may be presumed with the former but not with the latter-is not clear. Notably, this person had been \u201cinvolved\u201d with Sheridan-how, we are not told, except that Sheridan once lived on his property-suggesting that his information was derived from more than just \u201ca chance encounter with crime,\u201d <em>Martinez, </em>\u00b6 34. Moreover, Sheridan apparently damaged the informant\u2019s property, and the nature of their relationship sounds somewhat aloof, if not antagonistic, all of which suggests that the informant\u2019s motives were questionable-a possibility Fiddler does not address in his application.</p>\n<p id=\"Axp\">\u00b6135 But even assuming this informant was acting as a \u201cconcerned citizen\u201d when Fiddler spoke with him, the factual information (as opposed to the suspicions) he imparted-namely, that at some point in time, Sheridan lived on his property; that during that period of time, his closet was discolored in a manner consistent with the presence of iodine; and that at some point after Sheridan lived on his property, he found a box labeled \u201cJune\u2019s Stuff\u2019 in which he found items consistent with meth production-if taken as true, establishes only that at some point in time, Sheridan possessed ingredients and apparatus consistent with the manufacture of methamphetamine. This information is of little probative value in establishing probable cause to search Barnaby\u2019s house. And as for the informant\u2019s uncorroborated conjecture-based on \u201cwhat he had heard about the production of Methamphetamine\u201d-that Sheridan at some point in time was \u201cinvolved <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>with the production of the drug,\u201d this is of even less value in establishing probable cause to search Barnaby\u2019s residence.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-4\">\u00b6136 Assertion 7. On October 17, 2001, while at the Ace Hardware store in Ronan, Northwest Drug Task Force Agent Jody Durham (\u201cDurham\u201d) observed \u201ca female\u201d purchasing two cans of toluol (a chemical, Fiddler notes, that is a common solvent found in the production of methamphetamine). Durham believed that this was odd, and thus he reported it to the other members of the task force, along with the vehicle plate the female was driving. Durham later identified Sheridan (in a photograph) as the female who had purchased the toluol.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-5\">\u00b6137 Analysis: Given the investigation by Durham and Fiddler of Durham\u2019s observation, this tip is reliable. <em>See Reesman, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 33, 43-45.</p>\n<p id=\"AvZ\">\u00b6138 Assertion 8. On November 5, 2001, Flathead Tribal Police Officer Brian Fyant (\u201cFyant\u201d) advised Fiddler that Sheridan resides part of the time at her parents\u2019 home, that Sheridan had kept an eye on the home while her parents were out of town for approximately two weeks, and that Sheridan\u2019s parents became ill with sinus problems shortly after returning home. Fiddler notes here that \u201cit is common for people to suffer from similar sinus problems when they have been exposed to the production of Methamphetamine or have been exposed to where the production of Methamphetamine actually took place.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"A82Z\">\u00b6139 Analysis: Based on Fyant\u2019s information, Fiddler insinuates that Sheridan manufactured meth in her parents\u2019 house during their two-week absence. We are not told, however, when and how Fyant came by his information. Is it based on his personal observations? Is it bar talk? Did he (or Fiddler, for that matter) actually speak with Sheridan\u2019s parents? Is the information even current?</p>\n<p id=\"b290-6\">\u00b6140 Moreover, Fiddler\u2019s reasoning leaves much to be desired. Sheridan\u2019s parents could have just as conceivably become ill with sinus problems because they caught a flu bug during their trip. Or, as long as we are speculating, perhaps Fyant mistook the parents\u2019 symptoms (assuming he actually observed them) for hay fever. Maybe the parents had just returned from a city with a high pollen count. Unless we are willing to presume that most sinus afflictions result from proximity to meth labs, Fyant\u2019s information is wholly unconvincing. As with much of his application, Fiddler apparently would have the reviewing judicial officer simply ratify his hypothesis without any supporting facts or investigation on his part whatsoever.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-7\">\u00b6141 Assertion 9. On November 7, 2001, Fiddler was contacted by a \u201cconcerned citizen\u201d who reported that \u201cSheridan is living with a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>\u2018Barnaby\u2019 \u201d at \u201cthe Bamaby residence on \u2018dirty corner\u2019 near Cold Water Lane.\u201d (This is the first mention of Barnaby in the warrant application.) This person also reported that \u201cthey believed\u201d that Sheridan was \u201coperating a Methamphetamine lab at the Bamaby residence and at a residence in the Dixon area.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b291-4\">\u00b6142 Analysis: It is not clear from Fiddler\u2019s use of the pronoun \u201cthey\u201d whether he is referring to more than one informant. That point aside, what are some of the underlying circumstances from which the informant(s) reached the conclusion that Sheridan was operating a meth lab at Barnaby\u2019s residence? And what are some of the underlying circumstances from which Fiddler concluded that the informant(s) was (were) credible or that his/her/their information was reliable? Fiddler was required to provide some facts bearing on these two issues. He did not.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-5\">\u00b6143 Indeed, the only information bearing on the credibility of the informant(s) is the \u201cconcerned citizen\u201d label assigned by Fiddler; however, we have no basis on which to judge whether this characterization is accurate. Again, simply labeling a person a \u201cconcerned citizen\u201d does not determine the trae nature of that person or the type of scrutiny that must be imposed on her and her information by the reviewing judicial officer. <em>State v. Beaupre, </em>2004 MT 300, \u00b6 43, 323 Mont. 413, \u00b6 43, 102 P.3d 504, \u00b6 43; <em>State v. Olson, </em>2003 MT 61, \u00b6 27, 314 Mont. 402, \u00b6 27, 66 P.3d 297, \u00b6 27; <em>Reesman, </em>\u00b6 34; <em>State v. Valley </em>(1992), 252 Mont. 489, 493, 830 P.2d 1255, 1258. It would help if Fiddler had explained how this informant\u2019s (these informants\u2019) \u201cchance encounter with crime\u201d led him/her/them to a belief that a meth lab was in operation at Barnaby\u2019s residence. As it is, however, the suspicion imparted by this person (these persons) at most warranted further investigation; it was not entitled to significant weight in the probable cause analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-6\">\u00b6144 Assertion 10. On November 28,2001, Fiddler was contacted by a \u201ccitizen informant\u201d who reported that Sheridan \u201cwas operating a Methamphetamine lab at the Barnaby residence near \u2018dirty-corner\u2019, and possibly at another residence near the St. Ignatius area.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b291-7\">\u00b6145 Analysis: As with the \u201ccitizen informant\u201d referenced in Assertion 6, we do not know whether this person was a \u201cconcerned citizen\u201d or a \u201cconfidential informant.\u201d But even assinning, for the sake of argument, that he/she was motivated by good citizenship, nothing in the application discloses the circumstances under which he/she came by his/her information. Indeed, we are left to imagine a \u201cchance encounter with crime\u201d from which this \u201ccitizen informant\u201d gleaned that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>Sheridan was operating a meth lab at the Barnaby residence and possibly at another residence. Perhaps this person was a utility company employee who just happened to observe the meth operation while lawfully on the premises. Or, maybe he/she was someone who was there to purchase drugs and subsequently decided to become an informant. As far as the application discloses, this person is the same person referenced in Assertion 9 reporting the same information that he/she had reported to Fiddler fourteen days earlier.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-4\">\u00b6146 The point is that a tip does not gain credibility simply because we can dream up reasonable scenarios in which the \u201ccitizen informant\u201d came by his/her information. Those facts-and facts supporting Fiddler\u2019s implicit conclusion that the informant and his/her information were reliable-should have been set forth in the application. As it was, however, the reviewing judge had \u201cno way of ascertaining whether this tip was rumor, speculation, vendetta, reprisal, or gossip. It is contrary to common sense that this information is a basis for probable cause to search a citizen\u2019s home and invade his privacy.\u201d <em>Valley, </em>252 Mont. at 494, 830 P.2d at 1258.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">\u00b6147 Assertions 11 and 12. On January 15, 2002, Agent Couture made contact with \u201ca female from the Family Health Pharmacy\u201d to see if there had been anyone in buying \u201clarge or odd amounts\u201d of pseudoephedrine or ephedrine products. The female identified Sheridan in a photo lineup as the person who \u201ccomes in at least once a week and purchases ephedrine products.\u201d (Fiddler notes here that \u201cto produce Methamphetamine one would need some type of ephedrine product.\u201d) The female also stated that Sheridan \u201cusually has a little girl with her with long blonde hair when she comes in.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b292-6\">\u00b6148 On January 17, 2002, Agent Durham returned to the Family Health Pharmacy with a photograph of Sheridan\u2019s daughter, whom the pharmacist identified as the little girl seen with Sheridan when she was purchasing ephedrine products. The pharmacist also told Durham \u201cthat she suspected Sheridan of illicit activity involving the ephedrine product purchases due to certain indicators including: physical appearance of skin under Sheridan\u2019s eyes, Sheridan acting very \u2018jittery\u2019, Sheridan always pays in cash and never requests a receipt.\u201d \u00b6149 Analysis: In stark contrast to the information provided by the various unidentified \u201cconcerned citizens\u201d and \u201ccitizen informants\u201d mentioned throughout Fiddler\u2019s application, the information imparted by the female and the pharmacist here seems reliable, given the detailed circumstances under which they came by that information (observing Sheridan and her daughter come into the pharmacy at least <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>once a week to purchase ephedrine products), the pharmacist\u2019s detailed observations of Sheridan\u2019s unusual appearance and behavior, and the investigation/corroboration conducted by Couture and Durham (the photo lineup and the photograph of Sheridan\u2019s daughter).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> To be sure, the magistrate is left to speculate as to the amount of pseudoephedrine and ephedrine that Sheridan purchased (Fiddler does not disclose the meaning of \u201clarge or odd amounts\u201d); but the fact that she went into the pharmacy to buy ephedrine products relatively often is established. Given these factors, these tips were entitled to substantial weight in the probable cause analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-4\">\u00b6150 Assertion 13. Also on January 17, 2002, Fiddler made contact with a \u201cconcerned citizen\u201d (also referred to by Fiddler as a \u201ccitizen informant\u201d and a \u201ccitizen\u201d), who had \u201cpersonally viewed\u201d some \u201codd events\u201d at Barnaby\u2019s residence. Specifically, the informant reported the following: that he knew Sheridan and the vehicle that belonged to her; that Sheridan\u2019s vehicle \u201cspends a lot of time at the Barnaby residence\u201d; that he \u201chas even seen someone pull the vehicle into the Barnaby drive, back all of the way up to the door, and begin un-loading stuff from the trunk of the Sheridan vehicle\u201d; that Sheridan\u2019s vehicle \u201chas been spending a lot of time at the Barnaby residence in the past two months\u201d; that since that time, \u201cthings have been strange\u201d; that \u201ca make shift barrier has been built out of blue tarps and black plastic between the blue home and the yellow home\u201d (a reference to the two homes located on Barnaby\u2019s property) \u201cso that a person could not see them un-loading items from the Sheridan vehicle or see the movement from home to home\u201d; that \u201cbefore Sheridan\u2019s arrival to the Barnaby home there was a fire going only every so often, like once or twice a year, out side the home (cultural fire- sweat house),\u201d but that \u201cin the past two months a fire is burning out side the home almost constantly\u201d; that \u201cduring times when there is strange activity, there is a fire burning outside\u201d; and that there is \u201ca lot of traffic to and from the Barnaby residence at all hours of the day and night, and only staying for a short amount of time.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b294-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>\u00b6151 Analysis: This tip is arguably the most important in the entire application. Yet, Fiddler did not disclose the underlying circumstances from which he concluded that this person\u2019s information was reliable. The application references no independent corroboration or investigation on his part whatsoever. Indeed, as far as we know, the activities described by this person had all ceased by the time Fiddler submitted his search warrant application nearly four weeks later on February 11, 2002.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">\u00b6152 Furthermore, as discussed above with respect to the informants referenced in Assertions 4, 6, 9, and 10, we do not know whether Fiddler\u2019s characterizations of this informant as a \u201cconcerned citizen\u201d and \u201ccitizen informant\u201d are accurate, since Fiddler did not disclose any facts bearing on this issue. (He only stated that he had \u201cmade contact with a concerned citizen\u201d who \u201chad personally viewed some odd events happening at the [Barnaby] residence.\u201d) As noted above (see \u00b6 128), it is possible that Fiddler intended both \u201cconcerned citizen\u201d and \u201ccitizen informant\u201d to mean a person who was motivated by good citizenship to disclose incriminating information gleaned from a chance encounter with crime. On the other hand, this may be a person who worked with Fiddler by reporting on the illegal activities of Sheridan. Again, we do not know, since Fiddler provided no factual support in the application for the labels he used. But even assuming this informant was motivated by good citizenship, Fiddler\u2019s reliance on this tip is a prime example of an officer\u2019s trying to establish probable cause on the basis of hunches, suspicions, and innuendo derived from otherwise innocent conduct, as opposed to evidence of actual criminal activity or innocent activity that is suspicious when associated with alleged criminal activity, <em>see State v. Griggs, </em>2001 MT 211, \u00b6\u00b6 46, 50, 306 Mont. 366, \u00b6\u00b6 46, 50, 34 P.3d 101, \u00b6\u00b6 46, 50.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-6\">\u00b6153 First, the citizen reported seeing \u201csomeone\u201d unloading \u201cstuff\u2019 from the trunk of Sheridan\u2019s vehicle. Was this on just one occasion? When did it occur? And what was the \u201cstuff\u2019 being unloaded? It could have been perfectly legal \u201cstuff\u2019; it could have been illicit \u201cstuff\u2019; it even could have been \u201cstuff\u2019 to cook meth. As it is, because Fiddler did not disclose (if he even knew) what sort of \u201cstuff\u2019 was being unloaded from Sheridan\u2019s vehicle, the reviewing judge was forced to speculate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>that the \u201cstuff\u2019 was the proper object of a search of Barnaby\u2019s home. We ought not to sanction search warrant applications seeking to search for and seize \u201cstuff\u2019 from a person\u2019s home-particularly when it appears, as here, that the purpose for seizing such \u201cstuff\u2019 is to ascertain, in the first instance, whether it is contraband or evidence of a crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-4\">\u00b6154 The citizen also reported that things have been \u201cstrange\u201d at the Bamaby residence over the past two months. For instance, he observed that a makeshift barrier had been constmcted out of blue tarps and black plastic between the blue home and the yellow home. The citizen opined that Sheridan and Barnaby built the barrier \u201cso that a person could not see them un-loading items from the Sheridan vehicle or see the movement from home to home.\u201d Curiously, notwithstanding this barrier, the informant somehow knew what was going on behind it: the unloading of \u201cstuff \u2019 from Sheridan\u2019s vehicle and movement from home to home. Or did the informant simply assume that the barrier had been erected for the purpose of hiding illicit activities? For all he knew, Sheridan and Bamaby erected this barrier for the purpose of preventing snowdrifts alongside the houses. Or perhaps they erected the barrier to gain some privacy from nosy neighbors. Whatever their reason, the point here is that the reviewing judge was expected to simply infer criminal activity at the Barnaby residence from otherwise innocuous conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-5\">\u00b6155 Notably, Fiddler acknowledged at Barnaby\u2019s trial that he \u201cnever said [putting tarps up] was unusual.\u201d Rather, \u201c[t]hat was something that the informant said. That\u2019s why it\u2019s listed on the search warrant application.\u201d Yet, Fiddler\u2019s reliance on <em>the informant\u2019s </em>belief that this activity was \u201cstrange\u201d is all the more reason for him to provide the reviewing judge with facts bearing on the informant\u2019s veracity. Moreover, if Fiddler himself did not find such activity to be unusual, then further investigation into whether such activity was indicative of Sheridan\u2019s manufacturing meth at Barnaby\u2019s house was called for.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-6\">\u00b6156 Also \u201cstrange\u201d in the citizen\u2019s view was the fact that since Sheridan\u2019s arrival, a fire was binning \u201calmost constantly\u201d outside the home. This activity, however, as with erecting a barrier, is perfectly legal. Lastly, the citizen reported \u201ca lot\u201d of short-stay traffic to and from the Bamaby residence day and night. Again, such activity is open to numerous interpretations-some lawful, some unlawful.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-7\">\u00b6157 Finally, assuming that Barnaby and Sheridan in fact unloaded \u201cstuff\u201d from the trunk of her vehicle on one or more occasions, that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>they did so behind a makeshift barrier, that they kept a fire burning outside the home almost constantly, and that there was a lot of traffic to and from the Bamaby residence \u201cat all hours of the day and night,\u201d these facts rise only to the level of suspicion of illicit activities. They certainly do not rise to the level under Article II, Sections 10 and 11, \u201cat which [Bamaby\u2019s] interest in privacy must yield to the governmental interest in investigating criminal behavior by searching for incriminating items\u201d in Bamaby\u2019s home. <em>State v. Sundberg </em>(1988), 235 Mont. 115, 119, 765 P.2d 736, 739.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-4\">\u00b6158 Assertion 14. In closing, Fiddler stated as follows: \u201cThe informants mentioned in this application have given reliable information in the past. All have been proven reliable with corroborating information that resulted in arrests from the information they provided. All of the above informants are separate and apart from each other, and are not aware of the others\u2019 participation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b296-5\">\u00b6159 Analysis: The presence of this catchall-the applicability of which is unclear<footnotemark>10</footnotemark>-reveals why Fiddler provided the reviewing judge with no factual grounds on which to assess the reliability of the informants discussed above: he presumed that he could instead provide a general assurance at the end of the application that all of the foregoing factual assertions are reliable. Until today, there was no support for this technique in any of our case law. Rather, as explained above, we require individualized assessments of reliability.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-6\">\u00b6160 Furthermore, as discussed in some detail already <em>(see </em>\u00b6\u00b6 128-29), Fiddler\u2019s catchall makes his arbitrary and inaccurate use of labels apparent. Tellingly, he did not characterize \u201c[t]he informants mentioned in this application\u201d as persons \u201cwho report[ed].. . chance encounters] with crime as a civic duty.\u201d Rather, he characterized them as persons who \u201chave given rehable information in the past\u201d and \u201chave been proven reliable with corroborating information that resulted in arrests from the information they provided.\u201d This is a description of persons who work with police, reporting on the illegal activities of others, not persons who are motivated by good citizenship to report chance encounters with crime. <em>See Reesman, </em>\u00b6 32; <em>State v. Martinez, </em>2003 MT 65, \u00b6 34, 314 Mont. 434, \u00b6 34, 67 P.3d 207, \u00b6 34. Thus, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>various \u201cconcerned citizens\u201d and \u201ccitizen informants\u201d referenced throughout Fiddler\u2019s application do not fit the definition of concerned citizens at all.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-4\">\u00b6161 This clarification is important since, as explained above, the assessment of information provided by a concerned citizen is quite different from the assessment of information provided by other informants. A person who is motivated by \u201cgood citizenship\u201d-which the reviewing judicial officer cannot possibly ascertain unless the circumstances by which the person\u2019s information became known are disclosed in the application-is presumed to be telling the truth. <em>Reesman, </em>\u00b6 34. Other informants, by contrast, enjoy no such presumption. <em>See Reesman, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 32, 35. For this reason, it is essential that the applicant properly characterize each person whose information he sets forth in the application <em>and </em>that he provide facts which support these characterizations. Fiddler did not do so; accordingly, we cannot reasonably presume the reliability of the tips provided by the persons he labeled as \u201cconcerned citizens\u201d and \u201ccitizen informants.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b297-5\">\u00b6 162 Having assessed the relative probative value of each individual assertion in Fiddler\u2019s search warrant application, I next assess the totality of the application.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-7\">C. The Totality of Fiddler\u2019s Application for Search Warrant</p>\n<p id=\"b297-8\">\u00b6163 Judge McNeil\u2019s task was to determine whether, given all the circumstances set forth in Fiddler\u2019s application, there was a fair probability that evidence of the crimes of criminal possession of dangerous drugs and criminal production or manufacture of dangerous drugs would be found in the residence, outbuildings, and numerous junk vehicles on Barnaby\u2019s property. Integral to this inquiry, he had to assess the relative weight of each factual assertion set forth in Fiddler\u2019s application (see \u00b6\u00b6 116-17 above), mindful of the heightened standard of persuasion mandated by Article II, Sections 10 and 11. The relative weight of each factual assertion, in turn, depended on the various indicia of reliability attending (or not attending) it-i.e., the veracity and basis of knowledge of the person supplying the information, any corresponding investigative or corroborative efforts, and any related information, set forth elsewhere in the application, tending to bolster the assertion (see \u00b6\u00b6 95-97 above).</p>\n<p id=\"b297-9\">\u00b6164 Correspondingly, our task as a reviewing court is to ensure that the judge had a substantial basis for concluding that probable cause existed. <em>Reesman, </em>\u00b6 19; <em>Gates, </em>462 U.S. at 238-39, 103 S.Ct. at 2332. In doing so, we pay great deference to the judge\u2019s probable cause <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>determination. <em>Reesman, </em>\u00b6 19. Such deference, however, is not boundless:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b298-4\">It is clear, first, that the deference accorded to a magistrate\u2019s finding of probable cause does not preclude inquiry into the knowing or reckless falsity of the affidavit on which that determination was based. Second, the courts must also insist that the magistrate purport to \u201cperform his \u2018neutral and detached\u2019 function and not serve merely as a rubber stamp for the police.\u201d A magistrate failing to \u201cmanifest that neutrality and detachment demanded of a judicial officer when presented with a warrant application\u201d and who acts instead as \u201can adjunct law enforcement officer\u201d cannot provide valid authorization for an otherwise unconstitutional search.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b298-5\">Third, reviewing courts will not defer to a warrant based on an affidavit that does not \u201cprovide the magistrate with a substantial basis for determining the existence of probable cause.\u201d \u201cSufficient information must be presented to the magistrate to allow that official to determine probable cause; his action cannot be a mere ratification of the bare conclusions of others.\u201d Even if the warrant application was supported by more than a \u201cbare bones\u201d affidavit, a reviewing court may properly conclude that, notwithstanding the deference that magistrates deserve, the warrant was invalid because the magistrate\u2019s probable-cause determination reflected an improper analysis of the totality of the circumstances, or because the form of the warrant was improper in some respect.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A8d\"><em>United States v. Leon </em>(1984), 468 U.S. 897, 914-15, 104 S.Ct. 3405, 3416-17 (citations and footnotes omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b298-6\">\u00b6165 Thus, we must <em>review-said </em>not simply defer to-Judge McNeil\u2019s determination of probable cause. More specifically, we must determine whether Fiddler provided the judge with sufficient information to allow him to determine probable cause and whether the judge\u2019s probable-cause determination reflected a proper analysis of the totality of the circumstances. In this review, we draw every reasonable inference possible to support Judge McNeil\u2019s determination, <em>Reesman, </em>\u00b6 19, which does not mean blindly accepting conclusory labels and assertions in the search warrant application but, rather, means \u201cdeducing a logical consequence from [the facts presented],\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 793 (8th ed. 2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b298-7\">\u00b6166 Assessing Fiddler\u2019s application under this approach, the inferences he asked Judge McNeil to draw-that Sheridan was operating a meth lab at Bamaby\u2019s residence and that there were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>ingredients and apparatus associated with the production of meth in \u201cthe residence, outbuildings, and numerous junk vehicles\u201d on Barnaby\u2019s property on or about February 11, 2002-while plausible, were improperly and insufficiently supported. Reduced to its essentials, Fiddler\u2019s application disclosed merely that Sheridan was purchasing, and at times stealing, suphedrine tablets, toluol, and \u201clarge or odd amounts\u201d of pseudoephedrine or ephedrine; that she had a reputation for manufacturing meth; and that she had been living part-time with Barnaby. Significantly, there is nothing in the application that implicates Barnaby in any criminal conduct; rather, the search of his home was based on the inference that evidence of Sheridan\u2019s illicit activities was present on his property.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-4\">\u00b6167 In this regard, the Court points out that the warrant application included \u201ccredible information of Sheridan\u2019s involvement in the production of methamphetamines,\u201d \u00b6 31, and \u201crehable information\u201d of Sheridan\u2019s frequent-or \u201cat least part-time\u201d-presenee at Barnaby\u2019s residence, \u00b6 34. Yet, none of this \u201ccredible\u201d and \u201creliable\u201d information links Sheridan\u2019s meth production to Barnaby\u2019s residence. In other words, even if it was true that Sheridan resided part-time at the Barnaby residence in late 2001 and early 2002, that she knew how to manufacture meth, that she had acquired ingredients and possessed apparatus consistent with the manufacture of meth at various times in the past, and that she had engaged in the manufacture of meth at various times in the past, it does not necessarily follow that evidence of such illicit conduct would be found on Barnaby\u2019s property on February 11, 2002. Certainly, these assumptions do not rise to the level of probable cause to search his home. <em>See State v. Griffin, </em>2004 MT 331, \u00b6 24, 324 Mont. 143, \u00b6 24, 102 P.3d 1206, \u00b6 24 (\u201cJust because a [driver] has a pipe in his pocket with untested white residue on it, does not mean his vehicle will contain evidence of a drug offense.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"A0E\">\u00b6168 The Court acknowledges \u201cthat Sheridan\u2019s mere presence at the house does not amount to sufficient probable cause to search Barnaby\u2019s residence.\u201d \u00b6 36; <em>see also </em>\u00b6 33 (\u201cWe agree that it does not follow in all cases, \u2018simply from the existence of probable cause to believe a suspect guilty, there is also probable cause to search his residence.\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>State v. Kaluza </em>(1993), 262 Mont. 360, 362, 865 P.2d 263, 264)). Thus, the Court cites <em>State v. Gray, </em>2001 MT 250, 307 Mont. 124, 38 P.3d 775, and <em>State v. St. Marks, </em>2002 MT 285, 312 Mont. 468, 59 P.3d 1113, for the proposition that criminal conduct by Sheridan may be \u201cimpute[d]\u201d to Barnaby. <em>See </em>\u00b6 35. Yet, aside from the fact that these cases are readily distinguishable from the case at hand, the Court\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>reasoning is analytically flawed: imputation of Sheridan\u2019s suspicious activities to Barnaby does not <em>establish </em>a criminal undertaking at his house; rather, it <em>depends </em>on the existence of one. For instance, in <em>Gray, </em>the suspicious activity supposedly imputed to Gray was the building of a room by Gray\u2019s associate, Wallace, in the upper portion of Gray\u2019s residence to facilitate Gray\u2019s marijuana grow operation. <em>Gray, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 4,21. Obviously, this activity by Wallace, who had a criminal history involving dangerous drugs, pertained directly to the search of Gray\u2019s residence. Likewise, in <em>St. Marks, </em>the search warrant application disclosed that both St. Marks and his associate, Torres, were engaged <em>together </em>in dealing drugs. <em>St. Marks, </em>\u00b6 5. Thus, Torres\u2019s arrest and possession of large amounts of cocaine-the very drug St. Marks and Torres allegedly had been selling-\u201cprovided an indicia of reliability concerning [the confidential informant\u2019s] statements about the alleged criminal activity of St. Marks.\u201d <em>St. Marks, </em>\u00b6 37.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-4\">\u00b6169 In the case at hand, by contrast, Fiddler\u2019s application discloses no illicit activity whatsoever on the part of Barnaby, much less Bamaby\u2019s participation in Sheridan\u2019s suspicious activities. Not surprisingly, therefore, the Court sets forth no factual basis for imputing these activities to Barnaby; it simply imputes them. Yet, as stated above, the premises that Sheridan lived part-time with Barnaby and was involved in the production of meth do not, by themselves, establish a fair probability that evidence of the latter would be found <em>in Barnaby\u2019s home </em>on February 11, 2002. Rather, the crucial link in this chain comes from the informants referenced in Assertions 9, 10, and 13, who, as set forth above, reported the following information: that Sheridan is living with Barnaby at the Barnaby residence and is operating a meth lab <em>at this location </em>and at a residence in the Dixon area (Assertion 9, the \u201cconcerned citizen\u201d who contacted Fiddler on November 7, 2001); that Sheridan is operating a meth lab <em>at the Barnaby residence </em>and possibly at another residence in the St. Ignatius area (Assertion 10, the \u201ccitizen informant\u201d who contacted Fiddler on November 28, 2001); and that \u201cthings have been strange\u201d at the Barnaby residence \u201cin the past two months\u201d (Assertion 13, the person, labeled as both a \u201cconcerned citizen\u201d and a \u201ccitizen informant,\u201d with whom Fiddler made contact on January 17, 2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b300-6\">\u00b6170 Relying on these three assertions <em>(compare </em>\u00b6 37 <em>with </em>\u00b6\u00b6 141, 144,150), the Court \u201c \u2018infer\u00eds]\u2019 \u201d probable cause to believe that evidence of Sheridan\u2019s illicit activities was located in Barnaby\u2019s residence from the \u201csuspicious and illegal\u201d activities allegedly occurring there, \u00b6\u00b6 33, 37.1 might be inclined to agree with this reasoning were it not for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>fact that the informants who described the purportedly suspicious and illegal activities in Assertions 9,10, and 13 are of unknown reliability, as are their tips; and bare, unsubstantiated suspicions are not a sufficient basis on which to issue a search warrant, <em>State v. Bennett </em>(1972), 158 Mont. 496, 499, 493 P.2d 1077, 1078 (\u201cProbable cause . . . has been distinguished as being <em>more than bare suspicion.\u201d </em>(emphasis added) (citing <em>Brinegar v. United States </em>(1949), 338 U.S. 160, 175, 69 S.Ct. 1302, 1310)).</p>\n<p id=\"b301-4\">\u00b6171 The flaw in the Court\u2019s reasoning-indeed, in its approach to this entire case-is apparent from the question it seeks to answer. According to the Court, we must determine whether Sheridan\u2019s involvement in the production of methamphetamines, her continued presence at Barnaby\u2019s house, the two reports that Sheridan operated a meth lab at Bamaby\u2019s house, and the report of suspicious activity at Barnaby\u2019s house since Sheridan\u2019s arrival amount to a substantial basis for determining whether probable cause supported the issuance of the search warrant for Barnaby\u2019s home. \u00b6 39. The answer to this question, of course, is yes, this information <em>does </em>amount to a substantial basis for determining whether probable cause supported the issuance of the search warrant-but <em>only if </em>the information is worthy of belief. Thus, the Court simply has answered the wrong question, which is whether Assertions 9, 10, and 13 are worthy of belief, either individually or collectively.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-5\">\u00b6172 Unquestionably, Assertions 9 and 10, had they been properly corroborated, would have established probable cause to search Bamaby\u2019s residence within a reasonable time after the tips were received in November 2001. As it is, however, these naked allegations are even less probative than the anonymous letter received by the police in <em>Gates </em>(which related an assortment of details concerning the Gateses\u2019 alleged criminal activities that the investigating detective then corroborated in major part). Are these informants honest? Is their information reliable? As discussed several times already, we are unable to ascertain whether Fiddler\u2019s characterizations of these persons as a \u201cconcerned citizen\u201d and a \u201ccitizen informant,\u201d respectively, are accurate. Furthermore, as the Court acknowledges (see \u00b6 13), Fiddler failed to state the source of or basis for these informants\u2019 allegations that Sheridan was operating a meth lab at Barnaby\u2019s residence. Were the allegations rumor, speculation, vendetta, reprisal, gossip, and/or bar talk? We are left to wonder, as Judge McNeil should have, since Fiddler neither corroborated this information nor set forth a factual basis on which to conclude that the tips were worthy of any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>weight in the totality-of-the-circumstances analysis. Thus, by themselves, these assertions do not support a finding of probable cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-4\">\u00b6173 The same is true of Assertion 13. Again, there is no factual basis in the application for crediting Fiddler\u2019s use of the labels \u201cconcerned citizen\u201d and \u201ccitizen informant.\u201d But even if the person referenced in Assertion 13 was motivated by good citizenship to disclose incriminating information gained through a chance encounter with crime or is one of Fiddler\u2019s informants who \u201chave given reliable information in the past\u201d and \u201chave been proven reliable with corroborating information that resulted in arrests from the information they provided\u201d (the Assertion 14 catchall), the events he observed, though they may have been \u201codd\u201d to him, were not unlawful.</p>\n<p id=\"AqL\">\u00b6174 Thus, the only remaining question is whether Assertions 9,10, and 13, <em>taken together, </em>add up to probable cause to search Barnaby\u2019s home. In this regard, the Court correctly notes that \u201c[flactors that possess little probative value on their own, when considered under the totality of the circumstances test, can provide support for a determination of substantial evidence to conclude probable cause existed when considered in combination with other information.\u201d \u00b6 39. Indeed, a deficiency in an informant\u2019s information is not necessarily fatal to a finding of probable cause if other circumstances set forth in the application compensate for the deficiency-which is precisely the point of the totality-of-the-circumstances approach.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-6\">\u00b6175 For instance, as discussed earlier, a deficiency in an informant\u2019s veracity may be compensated for, in determining the overall reliability of his tip, by a strong showing as to his basis of knowledge. Similarly, a deficiency in an informant\u2019s basis of knowledge may be compensated for by a strong showing as to his veracity; and a deficiency in his veracity and basis of knowledge may be compensated for by independent corroboration of his tip. <em>See Gates, </em>462 U.S. at 233-34, 241-42, 103 S.Ct. at 2329-30, 2334. In the same vein, a tip possessing little probative value on its own may bolster, or be bolstered by, related and more reliable information set forth elsewhere in the warrant application. <em>See State v. Gray, </em>2001 MT 250, \u00b6\u00b6 17, 21, 307 Mont. 124, \u00b6\u00b6 17, 21, 38 P.3d 775, \u00b6\u00b6 17, 21; <em>State v. Rinehart </em>(1993), 262 Mont. 204, 211, 864 P.2d 1219, 1223; <em>State v. Holstine </em>(1993), 260 Mont. 310, 315, 860 P.2d 110, 113; <em>State v. Campbell </em>(1992), 254 Mont. 425, 428, 838 P.2d 427, 429; <em>Gates, </em>462 U.S. at 233, 103 S.Ct. at 2329. \u00b6176 In applying these principles to Fiddler\u2019s application, however, the Court distorts the meaning of <em>\u201ccompensate </em>for the deficiency,\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>concluding that three grossly deficient tips (Assertions 9,10, and 13), when considered together, can magically nullify each other\u2019s shortcomings and add up to a fair probability that evidence of a crime will be found in the place to be searched. <em>See </em>\u00b6\u00b6 37,46. In other words, the Court adopts an approach under which a collection of assertions each possessing negligible probative value on their own can, <em>in sufficient numbers, </em>add up to probable cause. Thus, while one anonymous Crimestoppers\u2019 tip is not adequate to support probable cause, <em>see Rinehart, </em>262 Mont. at 211, 864 P.2d at 1223, three are under the Court\u2019s new standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-4\">\u00b6177 This apparently is the result of the Court\u2019s \u201csimply overruling]\u201d in our search and seizure jurisprudence \u201cthe proposition set forth <em>xsxReesman </em>that independent police work represents the only method of corroboration under the totality of the circumstances test,\u201d which the Court characterizes as \u201can unduly restrictive rule that never should have been imposed.\u201d \u00b6\u00b6 42, 45. Although the Court does not specify what other methods of corroboration are proper, its analysis suggests that unsubstantiated tips from informants about whom we are told nothing can corroborate each other to such an extent that probable cause is established, leaving one to question whether the Court\u2019s admonishment to law enforcement \u201cto corroborate independently information from sources of questionable reliability,\u201d \u00b6 42, is merely lip service, or a directive that is applicable on an ad hoc basis-but obviously not in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-5\">\u00b6178 In any event, the Court\u2019s novel \u201c0 + 0 + 0 = Probable Cause\u201d approach not only finds no support in <em>Gates </em>or any of our case law, but also renders the constitutional protections against unreasonable searches and seizures hollow formalisms. Article II, Sections 10 and 11, require that the factual assertions set forth in a warrant application be stringently buttressed such that the reviewing judicial officer has a concrete and independent sense that contraband or evidence of a crime will be found in the place to be searched (see \u00b6 90 above). Notwithstanding this constitutional mandate, the Court today reduces the level of persuasion necessary to establish probable cause to issue a search warrant in this State to a standard that arguably does not even satisfy the Fourth Amendment. The fact is that the report of one informant about whom we are told nothing and the conjecture of two other informants about whom we are told nothing add up to very little-certainly not a concrete and independent sense that contraband or evidence of a crime will be found in the place to be searched. \u201cIn determining probability, it is not the number of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>statements, tips or events that is determinative relative to the common sense approach, it is the probative force of one, some or all of them. Insufficient data to establish probable cause is not strengthened by number or repetition.\u201d <em>Valley, </em>252 Mont. at 493, 830 P.2d at 1258. The Court\u2019s contrary conclusion renders the greater right to privacy that exists under Article II, Section 10, a practical nullity in the search and seizure context.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-4\">\u00b6179 But even if it could be said that Assertions 9,10, and 13 have probative force when considered together, the facts that would then be established by these three tips are untimely vis-a-vis the date of Fiddler\u2019s search warrant application. \u201cThe factors supporting probable cause must not be stale and they must indicate that the contraband or evidence would <em>presently </em>be at the place searched.\u201d <em>Holstine, </em>260 Mont. at 314, 860 P.2d at 113 (emphasis added). \u201cAn \u2018affidavit must set forth facts sufficient to show that a law is being violated <em>at the time the warrant is issued.\u2019 \u201d State v.

D. </em>(1975), 168 Mont. 357, 362, 543 P.2d 193, 196).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b304-5\">Where the affidavit recites a mere isolated violation [of the law] it would not be unreasonable to imply that probable cause dwindles rather quickly with the passage of time.

On November 5,2001, Officer Fyant reported that Sheridan was living part-time at her parents\u2019 home (Assertion 8). On November 7, 2001, a \u201cconcerned citizen\u201d reported that Sheridan was living at the Barnaby residence (Assertion 9). And on January 17, 2002, an informant reported that Sheridan\u2019s vehicle had been spending a lot of time at the Barnaby residence \u201cin the past two months\u201d (Assertion 13). Thus, it seems that for approximately two months, beginning in November <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>2001, Sheridan lived part-time or, at least, \u201cspen[t] a lot of time\u201d at Bamaby\u2019s residence.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-4\">\u00b6181 But there is no indication whether she continued to do so after January 17, 2002-a crucial fact, since the basis for searching Bamaby\u2019s house four weeks later was Sheridan\u2019s alleged meth-related activities there. Similarly, there is no indication whether the meth production reported on November 7 and November 28, 2001 (Assertions 9 and 10) and the \u201cstrange\u201d things reported on January 17, 2002 (Assertion 13) were still occurring on or about February 11,2002 (the date of Fiddler\u2019s application). Even an investigation by Fiddler that was \u201cless complete than would be desirable,\u201d yet proximate to February 11, 2002, could have satisfied the timeliness requirement. <em>See State v. Crowder </em>(1991), 248 Mont. 169, 173-74, 810 P.2d 299, 302. As it is, however, his application discloses no corroboration whatsoever of the information set forth in Assertions 9, 10, and 13 and no reasonable basis for presuming that Sheridan was still cooking meth at Bamaby\u2019s house. Thus, as far as we know from Fiddler\u2019s application, the illicit activities allegedly occurring on Bamaby\u2019s property between November 2001 and January 2002 had all ceased by February 11, 2002, and Sheridan was living full-time at her parents\u2019 house and manufacturing all of her meth there.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-5\">\u00b6182 In sum, what we are dealing with are three informants about whom we know absolutely nothing, whose information was obtained from unknown sources, and whose observations were not corroborated, <em>but </em>whose allegations-that Sheridan was cooking meth at Barnaby\u2019s residence, where \u201codd\u201d events have taken place-comprised the essential basis for a finding of probable cause to search his home. To be sure, their tips are inflammatory; however, bare suspicion and innuendo derived from uncorroborated observations of unknown informants are not a basis on which to invade our citizens\u2019 homes, and Assertions 9, 10, and 13-taken together with the other assertions in the application-do not rise to the level of persuasion required under Article II, Sections 10 and 11, to establish probable cause to issue a search warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-6\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b305-7\">\u00b6183 Judge McNeil did not have a substantial basis for concluding that probable cause existed to search Barnaby\u2019s home and surrounding property. Fiddler\u2019s application for search warrant relied on nothing more than innuendo, suspicion, and judicial ratification. With the exception of Assertions 5, 7, 11, and 12, none of the factual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>assertions-at least none of the <em>crucial </em>factual assertions-set forth in his application was investigated or corroborated, and he provided no facts whatsoever concerning the veracity of the persons whose information he imparted. Rather, he relied on a catchall near the end of his application that all of his informants were reliable. Notably, while all of these persons had been proven reliable with corroborating information \u201cin the past,\u201d they were not so proven on this occasion. <em>Cf. Gates, </em>462 U.S. at 239, 103 S.Ct. at 2332-33 (\u201cAn officer\u2019s statement that \u2018[ajffiants have received reliable information from a credible person and do believe\u2019 that heroin is stored in a home, is . . . inadequate.\u201d (alteration in original)). As stated above, \u201c[the reviewing judicial officer\u2019s] action cannot be a mere ratification of the bare conclusions of others.\u201d <em>Gates, </em>462 U.S. at 239, 103 S.Ct. at 2333.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-4\">\u00b6184 For these reasons, I cannot agree with the Court\u2019s approach here. I do not believe that any appellate court-much less this Court, which is bound by the greater protections afforded under Article II, Sections 10 and 11, of the Montana Constitution-should enable the sort of police work evident here. The courts cannot become foot soldiers in the war on drugs at the expense of their independent role as guardians of the Constitution. \u201cThe needs of law enforcement stand in constant tension with the Constitution\u2019s protections of the individual against certain exercises of official power. It is precisely the predictability of these pressures that counsels a resolute loyalty to constitutional safeguards.\u201d <em>Almeida-Sanchez v. United States </em>(1973), 413 U.S. 266, 273, 93 S.Ct. 2535, 2540. As Justice Jackson observed, soon after his return from the Nuremberg Trials <em>(see Almeida-Sanchez, </em>413 U.S. at 274, 93 S.Ct. at 2540):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b306-5\">These [Fourth Amendment rights], I protest, are not mere second-class rights but belong in the catalog of indispensable freedoms. Among deprivations of rights, none is so effective in cowing a population, crushing the spirit of the individual and putting terror in every heart. Uncontrolled search and seizure is one of the first and most effective weapons in the arsenal of every arbitrary government. And one need only briefly to have dwelt and worked among a people possessed of many admirable qualities but deprived of these rights to know that the human personality deteriorates and dignity and self-reliance disappear where homes, persons and possessions are subject at any hour to unheralded search and seizure by the police.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b306-6\"><em>Brinegar, </em>338 U.S. at 180-81, 69 S.Ct. at 1313 (Jackson, J., joined by Frankfurter and Murphy, JJ., dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b307-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>\u00b6185 This Court\u2019s duty to enforce these rights in Montana is all the more compelling given the broader right to privacy guaranteed by Article II, Section 10. While it is difficult to do so in cases such as this, where evidence of illicit activities was found in the place searched, the reality is that the contours of the right to privacy vis-a-vis the government\u2019s interest in ferreting out crime is most often, if not always, given meaning in such contexts.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b307-4\">[T]he right to be secure against searches and seizures is one of the most difficult to protect. Since the officers are themselves the chief invaders, there is no enforcement outside of court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b307-5\">Only occasional and more flagrant abuses come to the attention of the courts, and then only those where the search and seizure yields incriminating evidence and the defendant is at least sufficiently compromised to be indicted. If the officers raid a home, an office, or stop and search an automobile but find nothing incriminating, this invasion of the personal liberty of the innocent too often finds no practical redress. There may be, and I am convinced that there are, many unlawful searches of homes and automobiles of innocent people which turn up nothing incriminating, in which no arrest is made, about which courts do nothing, and about which we never hear.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b307-6\">Courts can protect the innocent against such invasions only indirectly and through the medium of excluding evidence obtained against those who frequently are guilty. . . . [A] search against Brinegar\u2019s car must be regarded as a search of the car of Everyman.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b307-7\"><em>Brinegar, </em>338 U.S. at 181, 69 S.Ct. at 1313-14 (Jackson, J., joined by Frankfurter and Murphy, JJ., dissenting). Likewise, a search of Barnaby\u2019s home must be regarded as a search of the home of every Montanan. In sanctioning Fiddler\u2019s search warrant application, the Court places in jeopardy the right of <em>all </em>Montanans to be secure against unreasonable searches and seizures.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-8\">\u00b6186 With respect to <em>Reesman, </em>our opinion in that case did not establish any new law or impose any new obligations on police, prosecutors, or judges. To the contrary, as explained above, the opinion merely pulled together in one place extant precedent and unambiguously articulated existing Montana search and seizure jurisprudence with respect to the use of various types of information in search warrant applications, all in the hope and expectation that the police would investigate suspected criminal activity more thoroughly, that police and prosecutors would draft more concise applications for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>search warrants, and that the lower courts would be more vigilant in assessing the constitutional requirement of probable cause, faithful to the greater rights of individual privacy enjoyed by all Montanans under Article II, Sections 10 and 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-4\">\u00b6187 As stated already, the Court\u2019s Opinion, in my view, only pays mere lip service to the principles and approach of <em>Reesman </em>and the cases it cites. The Court\u2019s deviation from the <em>Reesman </em>framework is not \u201cslightn,\u201d \u00b6 41; it is substantial.

It assures us that it \u201cstrike[s] not even a glancing blow upon the continued vitality of <em>Meyer,\u201d </em>\u00b6 44; that it \u201cfully agree[s]\u201d with the probable cause analyses in <em>Bowman, Olson, </em>and <em>Grams, </em>\u00b6 45; and that it has \u201csimply overrule[d]\u201d in our search and seizure jurisprudence \u201can unduly restrictive rule that never should have been imposed\u201d by <em>Reesman, </em>\u00b6 45. These assurances, however, miss the point. I am not saying that the Court is overruling the <em>results </em>in <em>Meyer, Bowman, Olson, Grams, </em>and the other cases cited <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>above. Rather, I am saying that by analyzing Fiddler\u2019s search warrant application pursuant to an approach that is so utterly contrary to the step-by-step framework we set forth in <em>Reesman (compare </em>\u00b6\u00b6 31-37 &amp; 46 of the Court\u2019s Opinion <em>with Reesman, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 28-35), the Court necessarily and unavoidably calls into doubt any case that follows the <em>Reesman </em>approach, not to mention the cases from which the <em>Reesman </em>framework was derived.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-4\">\u00b6189 Indeed, the Court acknowledges as much-albeit implicitly. Laboring under the misconception that <em>Reesman </em>does not permit a tip possessing little probative value on its own to bolster, or be bolstered by, related and more reliable information set forth elsewhere in the search warrant application, the Court reduces <em>Reesman </em>to mere \u201cuseful guidelines,\u201d which the Court then dismisses as \u201cimpractical\u201d in cases such as this, where the police receive tips of dubious reliability from informants of unknown credibility. \u00b6 41. If the Court can bring itself only to pay lip service to the <em>Reesman </em>framework, then it should just overrule the <em>Reesman </em>line of cases explicitly.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-5\">\u00b6190 The war on drugs must not become a war on the constitutional right of Montanans to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures in their homes. \u201cThe Fourth Amendment is a charter of freedom that should be protected against incremental erosion.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> So much more, then, should this Court support, protect, and defend the greater protections afforded by Article II, Sections 10 and 11, of Montana\u2019s Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-6\">\u00b6191 For all of these reasons, I vigorously dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b265-5\"> The Court\u2019s approach vis-a-vis <em>State v. Reesman, </em>2000 MT 243, 301 Mont. 408, 10 P.3d 83, discussed below, is entirely of its own initiative. At no point in its brief does the State even hint that <em>Reesman </em>and the precedents collected in that opinion should be overruled. Nor does the State argue that the totality-of-the-circumstances approach as applied in our precedents subsequent to <em>Reesman </em>should be modified. To the contrary, the State argues that \u201cthe <em>Reesman </em>test\u201d was met in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b271-6\"> Search analysis in Montana is typically conducted under Article II, Sections 10 and 11, of the Montana Constitution, in addition to the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution. <em>State v.
