We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-10\">\u00b62 We consider the following issues on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b150-11\">\u00b63 Should this Court exercise plain error review to examine whether the State improperly combined two instances of tampering with a witness into a single criminal charge, thereby depriving Auld of his constitutional right to a unanimous jury verdict?</p>\n<p id=\"b150-12\">\u00b64 Did Auld\u2019s counsel render ineffective assistance by stipulating that an official proceeding was ongoing or about to be commenced and thus concede an element of the witness tampering charge?</p>\n<p id=\"b150-13\">\u00b65 Did the District Court err by ordering that Auld\u2019s ten-year sentence for tampering with a witness would run consecutively to Auld\u2019s previous criminal sentence from Hawaii?</p>\n<p id=\"b150-14\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b150-15\">\u00b66 On June 24, 2003, Auld was involved in a bar fight in Missoula\u2019s 10th Street Tavern with one of the bar\u2019s regulars, George Braun (Braun). Auld punched Braun and kicked him repeatedly in the head.</p>\n<p id=\"Ah\">\u00b67 Auld previously had been convicted in 1996 of burglary and theft in the first degree in Maui County, Hawaii, and sentenced to ten years imprisonment, but he had been released on parole on May 1, 2003. Auld was on parole at the time of the fight.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-16\">\u00b68 Detective Joe Gaffney investigated the incident. On June 26, 2003, Detective Gaffney conducted a telephone interview of Chad Onthank (Onthank), Auld\u2019s roommate who had witnessed the fight. A few days later, in a conversation with a third party about the fight in Onthank\u2019s presence, Auld related his version of events. Onthank privately did not agree with Auld\u2019s version, but he \u201cwent along\u201d with it. Auld asked Onthank to call Detective Gaffney and tell him that Auld and Onthank were not drinking at the bar on the night of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>fight and that Amy Nile, Onthank\u2019s girlfriend who worked at the bar, had called them there to beat up Bruun and his friend. Auld dialed Detective Gaffney\u2019s number and handed Onthank the telephone, but Onthank just left a message.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-4\">\u00b69 On July 1, 2003, Auld, having been arrested earlier that day, called Onthank from the Missoula County jail. During that telephone call, which was recorded, Auld asked Onthank to tell Rich Miller (Miller), Auld\u2019s parole officer, that Auld and Onthank had not been drinking on the night of the fight. Auld also requested that Onthank tell the police that Bruun was about to pull a knife when Auld attacked him. According to Onthank, neither of these things was true.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-5\">\u00b610 Auld was charged with criminal endangerment, tampering with witnesses or informants, and assault (Counts I, II, and III, respectively). After a trial on February 13,2004, Auld was found guilty of the lesser charge of assault under Count I and guilty on Count II. He was found not guilty on Count III. Auld was sentenced to six months imprisonment for Count I and ten years imprisonment for Count II, to run concurrently with each other but to run consecutively with any sentence imposed by the State of Hawaii. Auld appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-6\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b151-7\">\u00b611 We articulated the standards for applying plain error review in <em>State v. Finley </em>(1996), 276 Mont. 126, 137-38, 915 P.2d 208, 215, <em>overruled on other grounds by State v. Gallagher, </em>2001 MT 39, 304 Mont. 215, 19 P.3d 817:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-8\">[T]his Court may discretionarily review claimed errors that implicate a criminal defendant\u2019s fundamental constitutional rights, even if no contemporaneous objection is made . . . where failing to review the claimed error at issue may result in a manifest miscarriage of justice, may leave unsettled the question of the fundamental fairness of the trial or proceedings, or may compromise the integrity of the judicial process. . . . [W]e will henceforth use our inherent power of common law plain error review sparingly, on a case-by-case basis ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b151-9\">\u00b612 In <em>State v. Worthan, </em>2006 MT 147, \u00b6\u00b6 13-14, 332 Mont. 401, \u00b6\u00b6 13-14, 138 P.3d 805, \u00b6\u00b6 13-14, we described the applicable standard for reviewing claims of ineffective assistance of counsel:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-10\">To prevail on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, a defendant must show that his \u201ccounsel\u2019s performance fell below an objective standard of reasonableness\u201d and he must demonstrate prejudice, <em>i.e., </em>\u201cthe existence of a reasonable probability that the result of the proceeding would have been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>different absent counsel\u2019s unprofessional <em>errors.\u201d State v. Harris, </em>2001 MT 231, \u00b6\u00b6 18-19, 306 Mont. 525, \u00b6\u00b6 18-19, 36 P.3d 372, \u00b6\u00b6 18-19 (citing <em>Strickland v. Washington </em>(1984), 466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-4\">In addition, \u201c[t]he trial record must adequately document a challenged act or omission of defense counsel for a defendant to raise an ineffective assistance claim on appeal. In addition to documenting the error, the record available to this Court on appeal must afford sufficient understanding of the reasons for counsel's act or omission to answer the threshold question of whether the alleged error expresses a trial strategy or tactical decision. If the record does not supply the reason for counsel\u2019s act or omission, the claim must be raised by petition for post-conviction relief.\u201d <em>Harris, </em>\u00b6 21 (citations omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b152-5\">\u00b613 <em>\u201cWe </em>review a criminal sentence for legality only.\u201d <em>State v. Miller, </em>2006 MT 159, \u00b6 7, 332 Mont. 472, \u00b6 7, 139 P.3d 839, \u00b6 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b152-7\">\u00b614 Should this Court exercise plain error review to examine whether the State improperly combined two instances of tampering with a witness into a single criminal charge, thereby depriving Auld of his constitutional right to a unanimous jury verdict?</p>\n<p id=\"b152-8\">\u00b615 Auld contends that the State alleged multiple instances of tampering with a witness in a single charge. Count II of the Information read as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-9\">On or about June 24-July 8,2003, the above-named Defendant, knowing that an official proceeding or investigation was pending, purposely or knowingly attempted to induce a witness, Chad Onthank, to inform falsely by trying to get him to tell authorities that he had not been drinking in a bar and that the man that the Defendant had kicked had started the fight.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b152-10\">Auld argues that the charge referred to two separate incidents: Auld\u2019s request that Onthank lie to Detective Gaffney about the circumstances of the fight and Auld\u2019s request that Onthank lie to Miller about drinking at the bar, in violation of the conditions of his parole.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-11\">\u00b616 In addition, Auld points out that one element of tampering with a witness is that the accused must believe that an official proceeding or investigation is ongoing or about to be commenced. <em>See </em>\u00a7 45-7-206, MCA. Auld contends that there were two \u201cofficial proceedings\u201d at issue: the police investigation of the bar fight and the parole officer\u2019s oversight of Auld\u2019s compliance with the terms of his parole. As a result <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>of this allegedly improper combination of separate instances of tampering with a witness into one charge, Auld asserts that his constitutional right to a unanimous jury verdict has been violated and that this Court should exercise plain error review.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-4\">\u00b617  We reemphasize that defendants should make contemporaneous objections to perceived errors. <em>Finley, </em>276 Mont. at 138, 915 P.2d at 215. Auld never raised an objection to the Information on the basis that it improperly offered alternative means for the jury to convict on the alleged offense-allowing this matter to proceed to trial and verdict without bringing the issue to the attention of the District Court-and, further, he stipulated to the jury instructions. Auld\u2019s contentions and the record fail to persuade us that declining to review the claimed error for plain error \u201cmay result in a manifest miscarriage of justice, may leave unsettled the question of the fundamental fairness of the trial or proceedings, or may compromise the integrity of the judicial process.\u201d <em>Finley, </em>276 Mont. at 137, 915 P.2d at 215; <em>see also State v. Hill, </em>2005 MT 216, \u00b6\u00b6 25-26, 328 Mont. 253, \u00b6\u00b6 25-26, 119 P.3d 1210, \u00b6\u00b6 25-26 (declining to exercise plain error review where defendant failed to object to Information). Therefore, we decline to exercise plain error review.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-5\">\u00b618 Did Auld\u2019s counsel render ineffective assistance by stipulating that an official proceeding was ongoing or about to be commenced and thus concede an element of the witness tampering charge?</p>\n<p id=\"b153-6\">\u00b619 The following stipulation was read into the record at trial:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-7\">It is stipulated between the parties that in June and July of2003, the defendant, William Auld, was not permitted to go into bars or consume alcohol.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-8\">Rich Miller, an employee of a governmental agency was responsible for enforcing those rules. Rich Miller began an investigation to see if William Auld had violated those rales after the incident at the 10th Street Tavern. That investigation is considered an official proceeding as defined by Montana State law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b153-9\">\u00b620 Auld argues that his trial counsel rendered ineffective assistance by entering into this stipulation, effectively conceding in the last sentence an element of the offense of tampering with a witness, which is defined in \u00a7 45-7-206, MCA:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-10\">(1) A person commits the offense of tampering with witnesses and informants if, believing that an official proceeding or investigation is pending or about to be instituted, he purposely or knowingly attempts to induce or otherwise cause a witness or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>informant to:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b154-4\">(a) testify or inform falsely ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b154-5\">Auld contends that the last sentence of the stipulation \u201ctransformed\u201d the stipulation \u201cfrom an agreement on the facts to a legal conclusion equivalent to a jury instruction.\u201d In addition, Auld argues that \u201c[rjather than shielding the jury from his prior criminal history, the vague information from the stipulation left the jury to guess about the nature of Auld\u2019s prior crimes.\u201d The ineffective assistance was exacerbated, Auld posits, because Miller was permitted to testify at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-6\">\u00b621  Auld\u2019s argument is unavailing. The record reveals that the stipulation was entered into for strategic reasons, namely so that the jury would not hear that Auld was on parole at the time the offenses took place. \u201cCounsel\u2019s trial tactics and strategic decisions cannot be the basis upon which to find ineffective assistance of counsel.\u201d <em>Worthan, </em>\u00b6 21 (quoting <em>State v. Grixti, </em>2005 MT 296, \u00b6 25, 329 Mont. 330, \u00b6 25, 124 P.3d 177, \u00b6 25). Therefore, we affirm the judgment of conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"Au8\">\u00b622 Did the District Court err by ordering that Auld\u2019s ten-year sentence for tampering with a witness would run consecutively to Auld\u2019s previous criminal sentence from Hawaii?</p>\n<p id=\"b154-7\">\u00b623 Auld asserts that the \u201cplain language of the consecutive sentence statute does not allow a consecutive sentence to be imposed when the previous conviction originates from a court in another state . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b154-8\">\u00b624 The statute at issue is \u00a7 <em>46-18-401, </em>MCA, which reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b154-9\">(1) Unless the judge otherwise orders:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b154-10\">(a) whenever a person serving a term of commitment imposed by a court in this state is committed for another offense, the shorter term or shorter remaining term may not be merged in the other term; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b154-11\">(b) whenever a person under suspended sentence or on probation for an offense committed in this state is sentenced for another offense, the period still to be served on suspended sentence or probation may not be merged in any new sentence of commitment or probation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b154-12\">(4) Separate sentences for two or more offenses must run consecutively unless the court otherwise orders.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b154-13\">Auld maintains that the key statutory language in support of his argument is the phrase \u201cin this state\u201d found in subsections (l)(a) and (l)(b), contending that the statute \u201csimply permits the imposition of a consecutive sentence in relation to offenses committed in this state, and sentences imposed by Montana courts.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b155-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>\u00b625  We disagree that subsection (1) contains the decisive language on this issue. Instead, we read subsection (4) as clearly indicating that the public policy of Montana is to have sentences, wherever imposed, run consecutively unless otherwise ordered by a court. <em>Cf. Miller, </em>\u00b6 10 (\u00a7 46-18-401(4), MCA, does not provide that defendant should receive credit on suspended commitment in Montana for time spent in an Indiana prison on a separate conviction). Therefore, we affirm the sentence imposed by the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-4\">\u00b626 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b155-5\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES COTTER, WARNER,</judges>\n<judges id=\"b155-6\">LEAPHART and MORRIS concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b155-7\">JUSTICE NELSON</author>\n<p id=\"AWQ\">dissents and concurs.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-8\">\u00b627 I dissent from the Court\u2019s Opinion as to issues one and three and I concur with the Court\u2019s decision as to issue two.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-9\">\u00b628 Consistent with my positions in <em>State v. Weaver, </em>1998 MT 167, \u00b6\u00b6 22-40, 290 Mont. 58, \u00b6\u00b6 22-40, 964 P.2d 713, \u00b6\u00b6 22-40; <em>State v. Harris, </em>1999 MT 115, \u00b6\u00b6 35-36, 294 Mont. 397, \u00b6\u00b6 35-36, 983 P.2d 881, \u00b6\u00b6 35-36 (Nelson, J., concurring); <em>State v. Allum, </em>2005 MT 150, \u00b6\u00b6 59-64, 327 Mont. 363, \u00b6\u00b6 59-64, 114 P.3d 233, \u00b6\u00b6 59-64 (Nelson, J., dissenting); and <em>State v. Gallagher, </em>2005 MT 336, \u00b6 35, 330 Mont. 65, \u00b6 35, 125 P.3d 1141, \u00b6 35 (Nelson, J., concurring), I would reach the specific unanimity instruction issue via plain error review. Accordingly, to that extent, I do not agree with the Court\u2019s resolution of issue one.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-10\">\u00b629 As to issue three, I also disagree with the Court\u2019s analysis. It is perfectly clear that under \u00a7 46-18-401(1)(a) and (b), MCA, the only commitments and offenses which are encompassed within the statute are, respectively, those imposed by a court in this State and those committed in this State. If the Legislature had envisioned that out-of-state offenses would be included in the requirements of the statute, it would have said so. The Court reads \u00a7 46-18-401(4), MCA, in isolation from subsection (1). In so doing, the Court ignores the admonition of \u00a7 1-2-101, MCA, that requires that \u201c[w]here there are several provisions or particulars [of a statute], such a construction is, if possible, to be adopted as will give effect to all.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b155-11\">\u00b630 For these reasons I dissent as to issues one and three. As noted, I concur as to issue two.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
