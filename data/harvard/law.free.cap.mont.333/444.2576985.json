We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-6\">\u00b62 Joshua presents the following issues on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b470-7\">\u00b63 1. Whether the District Court possessed jurisdiction to rule on Charlotte\u2019s petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-9\">\u00b64 2. Whether the District Court erred in determining that the handwritten document Charlotte offered for probate constituted a valid holographic will.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-10\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b470-11\">\u00b65 The decedent, Mark Lambert (Mark), died in a car accident on May 27, 2004, in Sweet Grass County, Montana. Mark recently had left his home in Huntsville, Alabama apparently to seek employment in the Yellowstone National Park area. He had all of his personal property with him in his car at the time of the accident, with the exception of $115.67 held in a bank account in Alabama. Mark was survived by three children, including Joshua, and his mother, Charlotte.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-12\">\u00b66 Joshua petitioned the Probate Court of Madison County, Alabama, for Letters of Administration. Joshua\u2019s petition stated that Mark \u201cdied leaving no Last Will and Testament so far as your petitioner knows or believes.\u201d Alabama law does not require that notice be provided to the heirs at law or next of kin before a court will issue Letters of Administration. The Probate Court of Madison County granted Joshua Letters of Administration and appointed him as the personal representative of Mark\u2019s estate on July 9,2004. No notice was provided to the heirs at law or next of kin. The Alabama court has not further adjudicated Mark\u2019s estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-13\">\u00b67 Charlotte located Mark\u2019s will in July of2004 while reviewing his papers. Mark hand wrote and signed the will in Fulton County, Georgia, in December of 1999. The will named Charlotte as the executrix of his estate. Charlotte filed a petition for Formal Probate of Will, Determination of Testacy and Heirs, and Appointment of Personal Representative in Silver Bow County and offered Mark\u2019s handwritten will for probate. Charlotte\u2019s petition stated that jurisdiction in Silver Bow County was proper based upon the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>possibility of litigation in Montana.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-4\">\u00b68 Joshua filed a motion to dismiss Charlotte\u2019s petition, arguing that the court lacked jurisdiction and that Montana law rendered invalid the handwritten will. The District Court granted Charlotte\u2019s petition. The court maintained that it had jurisdiction pursuant to \u00a7 72-1-202, MCA, that provides for jurisdiction to the full extent permitted by the Constitution \u201cover all subject matter relating to... estates of decedents, including construction of wills and determination of heirs, and successors of decedents ....\u201d The court noted that the wrongful death cause of action constituted the primary asset of Mark\u2019s estate, and qualified as \u201cproperty\u201d under Montana\u2019s Uniform Probate Code. The court further noted that Montana law determined that the handwritten document qualified as a valid holographic will. The court thus ordered that the administration of Mark\u2019s estate proceed in Silver Bow County. Joshua appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-5\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b471-6\">\u00b69 We review a district court\u2019s findings of fact to determine if they are clearly erroneous. <em>Watson v. Dundas, </em>2006 MT 104, \u00b6 17, 332 Mont. 164, \u00b6 17, 136 P.3d 973, \u00b6 17. A court\u2019s findings prove clearly erroneous if they are not supported by substantial evidence, the court misapprehended the effect of the evidence, or we are convinced by our review of the record that the district court made a mistake. <em>Watson, </em>\u00b6 17. We review a district court\u2019s conclusions of law for correctness. <em>Watson, </em>\u00b6 17.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b471-8\">\u00b610 <em>Whether the District Court possessed jurisdiction to rule on Charlotte\u2019s petition.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b471-9\">\u00b611 Joshua argues that the District Court lacked jurisdiction because Mark was an Alabama resident and left no property in Montana. He asserts that the wrongful death cause of action cannot serve as property for purposes of Montana\u2019s Uniform Probate Code. Charlotte counters that Mark briefly survived the accident and that the wrongful death action contains a derivative survivorship claim. She further maintains that any damages arising from the survivorship claim belong to Mark\u2019s estate and must be distributed by the personal representative pursuant to Montana\u2019s probate laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-10\">\u00b612  At the outset we note that \u00a7 72-3-312, MCA, requires that a \u201cfinal order of a court of another state determining testacy, the validity or construction of a will, <em>made in a proceeding involving notice to and </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number><em>an opportunity for contest by all interested persons </em>must be accepted as determinative by the courts of this state ... \u201d (emphasis added). Alabama law does not require notice, however, to heirs-at-law or next of kin. <em>See </em>Ala. Code \u00a7\u00a7 43-2-40 through -48. In fact, the District Court specifically found that the Probate Court of Madison County, Alabama, did not provide notice or a hearing to Mark\u2019s heirs or next of kin. As a result, we are not required to accept the Alabama court\u2019s order as determinative. Moreover, as mentioned above in \u00b6 6, the Alabama probate court has not entered a final order determining testacy or the validity or construction of a will. We conclude therefore that we are not bound by the Letters of Administration issued from the Probate Court of Madison County, Alabama, in light of the Alabama court\u2019s failure to provide notice or a hearing to Mark\u2019s heirs or next of kin. Section 72-3-312, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-4\">\u00b613 Montana courts possess jurisdiction over \u201call subject matter relating to ... estates of decedents, including construction of wills and determination of heirs....\u201d Section 72-1-202, MCA. Montana\u2019s Uniform Probate Code applies to \u201cthe property of nonresidents located in this state or property coming into the control of a fiduciary who is subject to the laws of this state....\u201d Section 72-1-201(2), MCA. The Legislature defined \u201cproperty\u2019 broadly, as \u201canything that may be the subject of ownership.\u201d Section 72-1-103(40), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-5\">\u00b614  Montana law provides for two separate causes of action for survivors of a decedent whose death is caused by the negligence of another. Section 27-1-501, MCA, and \u00a7 27-1-513, MCA. Section 27-1-501, MCA, provides for survival cause of action and \u00a7 27-1-513, MCA, provides for a wrongful death action.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-6\">\u00b615  A survival cause of action provides that tort actions in existence during the decedent\u2019s lifetime survive his death. Section 27-1-501, MCA. No survival cause of action exists if the decedent died instantaneously. Section 27-1-501, MCA. Survival actions belong to the decedent\u2019s estate and any damages recovered are personal to the decedent and likewise belong to his estate. <em>Payne v. Eighth Judicial Dist. Court, </em>2002 MT 313, \u00b6 7, 313 Mont. 118, \u00b6 7, 60 P.3d 469, \u00b6 7. Only the personal representative may pursue survival actions for damages suffered by the decedent. <em>Payne, </em>\u00b6 7; \u00a7 27-1-501, MCA. Personal representatives must distribute damages awarded in a survival action in accordance with the laws of probate. <em>Swanson v. Champion Intern. Corp. </em>(1982), 197 Mont. 509, 516, 646 P.2d 1166, 1169.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-7\">\u00b616  Wrongful death actions, on the other hand, are personal to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>decedent's heirs and independent of any cause of action available to the decedent's estate. Section 27-1-513, MCA; <em>Payne, </em>\u00b6 8. This right of recovery seeks to compensate the heirs for the harm or damages that they personally suffered as a result of the decedent's death. <em>Payne, </em>\u00b6 8. Thus, any damages awarded in wrongful death causes of action are personal to the decedent\u2019s heirs and do not belong to the decedent\u2019s estate. <em>Swanson, </em>197 Mont. at 517, 646 P.2d at 1170.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-4\">\u00b617  Section 27-1-501(2), MCA, requires survival and wrongful death actions to be \u201ccombined into one legal action\u201d and provides that \u201cany element of damages may be recovered only once.\u201d Charlotte maintains that the autopsy report and accident report from Mark\u2019s death indicate that he survived for \u201can appreciable length of time\u201d following the accident. Joshua does not dispute these reports. These facts give rise to a potential survival right of action that would \u201cbelong\u201d to Mark\u2019s estate. <em>Payne, </em>\u00b6 7. The survival action therefore constitutes \u201cproperty\u2019 under Montana\u2019s Uniform Probate Code. We accordingly conclude that the District Court properly exercised jurisdiction over Charlotte\u2019s petition pursuant to \u00a7 72-1-201(2), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-5\">\u00b618 <em>Whether the District Court erred in determining that the handwritten document Charlotte offered for probate constituted a valid holographic will.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b473-6\">\u00b619 Joshua argues that the handwritten document Charlotte offered for probate does not qualify as a valid holographic will. He contends that the District Court should have applied Georgia or Alabama law when determining the validity of the holographic document, and that under the laws of those states the document was invalid. He further argues that no evidence exists demonstrating that Mark intended the document to constitute his will. Charlotte counters that Montana law applies and renders valid the holographic document as Mark\u2019s final will.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-7\">\u00b620  As noted, Montana\u2019s Uniform Probate Code applies to \u201cthe property of nonresidents located in this state ....\u201d Section 72-1-201(2), MCA. As we have already determined that the potential survivorship cause of action constitutes property for purpose of Montana\u2019s Uniform Probate Code, we will apply Montana law in assessing the validity of the holographic document that Charlotte submitted for probate.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-8\">\u00b621  Three requirements must be met for a holographic will to be a valid in Montana. First, the testator must be at least eighteen years of age and of sound mind. Section 72-2-521, MCA. Second, a holographic will meets the formalities of execution if its material provisions are in the handwriting of the testator and signed by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>testator. Section 72-2-522, MCA. Finally, the testator must have testamentary intent; he or she must intend that the document will dispose of his property after death. <em>See e.g. Matter of Estate of Ramirez </em>(1994), 264 Mont. 33, 36, 869 P.2d 263, 265; <em>In re Coleman\u2019s Estate </em>(1961), 139 Mont. 58, 359 P.2d 502; <em>In re Van Voast's Estate </em>(1954), 127 Mont. <em>450, 266 P.2d 377; In re Augestad's Estate </em>(1940), 111 Mont. 138, 106 P.2d 1087.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-4\">\u00b622 Joshua does not contest the facts that Mark was at least eighteen years of age and of sound mind at the time that he executed the holographic documentin 1999. Section 72-2-522(2), MCA, provides that a \u201cwill... is valid as a holographic will, whether or not witnessed, if the signature and material portions of the document are in the testator\u2019s handwriting.\u201d A written will is valid if written in compliance with \u00a7 72-2-522, MCA. Section 72-2-526, MCA. The District Court found that Joshua offered no evidence to contest that the holographic document submitted by Charlotte for probate was written and signed by Mark. The entire document is in Mark\u2019s handwriting and it bears his signature.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-5\">\u00b623 These findings of the District Court and Joshua\u2019s concessions leave only the matter of Mark\u2019s testamentary intent at issue. The District Court determined that the holographic document itself established by clear and convincing evidence that Mark intended the writing to constitute his will. Mark titled the document \u201cLast Will and Testament,\u201d and states that he does \u201chereby make, publish, and declare this instrument as and for my Last Will and Testament, hereby expressly revoking any and all will and codicils (especially that are signed by me (Mark A. Lambert) on November 30, 1995,) heretofore made by me.\u201d Mark proceeds to devote eleven pages to detailing his wishes for the distribution of his estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-6\">\u00b624  The testamentary intent that must be present is the intention to dispose of property after the testator's death. <em>Van Voast, </em>127 Mont. at 452-453, 266 P.2d at 378-379. The holographic document satisfies this criterion as evidenced by its opening line, as discussed above, \u00b6 23, <em>supra, </em>and by its repeated references on disposing of his property throughout the eleven page holographic document. According to \u00a7 72-3-310, MCA, Joshua, as the contestant of the will, bears the burden of establishing lack of testamentary intent. We cannot say that the District Court committed error in finding Mark intended the document to constitute his will. We therefore conclude that the District Court properly determined that the document constitutes a valid holographic will under Montana law.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>\u00b625 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b475-4\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES WARNER and COTTER concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b475-5\">JUSTICE NELSON</author>\n<p id=\"Anu\">concurs.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-6\">\u00b626 I concur in the Court\u2019s Opinion with the exception of the statement in \u00b6 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-7\">\u00b627 I cannot agree that because the requirements of Alabama probate law do not track precisely with those of Montana probate law, we are, as a result, at liberty to not accept the orders, judgments and decrees of our sister state.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-8\">\u00b628 Indeed, the Full Faith and Credit Clause of the United States Constitution, Article IV, Section 1, requires that full faith and credit be given in each state to the public acts, records and judicial proceedings of every other state. Moreover, this obligation is \u201cexacting.\u201d As we stated in <em>Carr v. Bett, </em>1998 MT 266, \u00b6 39, 291 Mont. 326, \u00b6 39, 970 P.2d 1017, \u00b6 39:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-9\">The U.S. Supreme Court has held that the full faith and credit obligation owed to final judgments is exacting. A final judgment rendered by a state court is entitled to full faith and credit in the courts of its sister states. <em>Underwriters National Assur. Co. v. North Carolina Life and Accident and Health Insurance Guaranty Ass'n </em>(1982), 455 U.S. 691, 102 S.Ct. 1357, 71 L.Ed.2d 558. The U.S. Supreme Court has stated that full faith and credit \u201cgenerally requires every State to give to a judgment at least the <em>res judicata </em>effect which the judgment would be accorded in the State which rendered <em>it.\u201dDurfee v. Duke </em>(1963), 375 U.S. 106, 109, 84 S.Ct. 242, 244, 11 L.Ed.2d 186[]. Moreover, \u201cthe judgment of a state court should have the same credit, validity, and effect, in every other court of the United States, which it had in the state where it was pronounced.\u201d <em>Underwriters National Assur. </em>Co., 455 U.S. at 704, 102 S.Ct. at 1365, 71 L.Ed.2d at 570 (citations omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b475-10\">\u00b629 While there are defenses to the application of the full faith and credit doctrine, none of those are articulated here. <em>See Carr, </em>\u00b6 42 (defenses of lack of personal and subject matter jurisdiction of the foreign court, fraud in the procurement of the judgment, lack of due process, satisfaction, or other grounds that make the judgment invalid or unenforceable, may be raised by a party seeking to reopen or vacate a foreign judgment).</p>\n<p id=\"b475-11\">\u00b630 More to the point, the only relevance of Alabama\u2019s probate proceedings to this matter would have to do with who is appointed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>personal representative of Mark Lambert\u2019s estate in Montana. That is not an issue here. Joshua, as the domiciliary personal representative in Alabama would typically have priority to be appointed personal representative in Mark\u2019s estate proceedings in Montana. Section 72-3-506, MCA. However, here, the exemption in this statute applies because Mark\u2019s holographic will specifically named Charlotte as the personal representative.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-4\">\u00b631 With those caveats, I concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
