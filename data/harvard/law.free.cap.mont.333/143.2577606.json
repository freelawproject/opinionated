(General Mills), was not liable for certain compensatory and punitive damages relating to Hallenberg\u2019s wheat farming operations. General Mills cross-appeals the determination of the compensatory damages that were awarded. We affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-12\">\u00b62 We consider the following issues raised by Hallenberg:</p>\n<p id=\"b168-13\">\u00b63 Did the District Court err by failing to find General Mills guilty of actual fraud required for punitive damages?</p>\n<p id=\"b168-14\">\u00b64 Did the District Court err by failing to find General Mills guilty <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>of actual malice required for punitive damages?</p>\n<p id=\"b169-3\">\u00b65 Did the District Court err by failing to award further compensatory damages?</p>\n<p id=\"b169-4\">\u00b66 We also consider several issues General Mills raises on cross-appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b169-5\">\u00b67 Did the District Court err by concluding that Hallenberg suffered a sixteen bushel per acre loss in 1999?</p>\n<p id=\"b169-6\">\u00b68 Did the District Court err by allowing Hallenberg to present evidence after he had rested his case-in-chief?</p>\n<p id=\"b169-7\">\u00b69 Did the District Court err by finding the per bushel value of the lost production to be $3.60?</p>\n<p id=\"b169-8\">\u00b610 Did the District Court abuse its discretion by qualifying Richter as an expert or by awarding prejudgment interest?</p>\n<p id=\"b169-9\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b169-10\">\u00b611 Hallenberg operates a grain farm in Toole and Glacier Counties. On May 17,1999, Hallenberg made arrangements with General Mills to clean and treat a load of wheat seed. Hallenberg parked his truck loaded with the seed at General Mills\u2019 facility, but instead of cleaning and treating the seed, General Mills inadvertently dumped it into a waste bin. General Mills personnel replaced the discarded seed with a variety of wheat seed called Fortuna, unaware that the dumped seed was a different variety, Westbread 936 (\u201c936\u201d). Though the two varieties are not readily distinguishable by the naked eye, the 936 seed produces a plant with a shorter stalk, earlier maturity date, greater resistance to shatter (loss of grain kernel due to wind or disturbance), and higher water usage rate than Fortuna. General Mills did not inform Hallenberg of the mishap or of the substituted seed, but it did bill him for the cleaning and treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-11\">\u00b612 Hallenberg picked up his truckload of seed from General Mills, took it back to his farm, and placed the Fortuna seed in his seeder-which contained a partial load of 936-and proceeded to plant it. Three months later, Hallenberg noticed two different varieties of wheat were growing. Hallenberg contacted General Mills about the problem and for the first time learned of the dumping error and substitution of seed.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-12\">\u00b613 On May 3,2001, Hallenberg filed a complaint in the District Court seeking compensatory and punitive damages for General Mills\u2019 actions. Following a bench trial, the District Court issued findings of fact, conclusions of law, and an order on September 14, 2004, awarding Hallenberg $18,432 plus interest and costs to compensate for his 1999 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>crop losses caused by General Mills\u2019 negligent misrepresentation that the seed returned to Hallenberg was the same he had delivered. More specifically, the District Court found that Hallenberg planted the mixed seed on 320 acres and yielded only twenty bushels per acre from this land. The District Court also found Hallenberg\u2019s crop from nearby land seeded solely with 936 yielded thirty-six bushels per acre in 1999 and that difference in per acre yields between the two parcels was due to the mishap at General Mills. To arrive at the $18,432 figure, the District Court took the difference in yields per acre (sixteen bushes) between the two sections of land, multiplied it by 320 acres, and multiplied the product by a per bushel value of $3.60.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-4\">\u00b614 In addition, the District Court concluded that Hallenberg had failed to plead that General Mills acted with actual malice and that even if Hallenberg had pled actual malice, Hallenberg failed to meet the clear and convincing burden of proof. The District Court further concluded that because General Mills had committed negligent misrepresentation it could not have committed actual fraud, as the two torts are mutually exclusive. Accordingly, the District Court ruled that there was no basis for awarding punitive damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-5\">\u00b615 The District Court acknowledged that Hallenberg put on evidence purporting to show that planting the mixed seed caused a reduced yield in subsequent years resulting in lower government crop insurance payments to Hallenberg. However, the District Court concluded that the evidence at trial was insufficient to quantify whatever loss of crop insurance proceeds Hallenberg may have experienced, and it awarded no damages for such loss.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-6\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b170-7\">\u00b616 In <em>Hidden Hollow Ranch v. Fields, </em>2004 MT 153, \u00b6 21, 321 Mont. 505, \u00b6 21, 92 P.3d 1185, \u00b6 21, we explained the standard of review for findings of fact and conclusions of law:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-8\">We review a district court\u2019s findings of fact to ascertain whether they are clearly erroneous. <em>Habel v.

A finding is clearly erroneous if it is not supported by substantial evidence, if the trial court misapprehended the effect of the evidence, or if our review of the record convinces us that a mistake has been committed. <em>Habel, </em>\u00b6 12. Our standard of review of a district court\u2019s conclusion of law is whether the court\u2019s interpretation of the law is correct. <em>Habel, </em>\u00b6 12.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b170-9\">\u00b617 \u201c[W]e review a district court\u2019s evidentiary rulings to determine <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>whether the court abused its discretion.\u201d <em>Travelers Indem.

In considering whether to assess punitive damages for actual fraud, the District Court reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-6\">A reading of the entirety of Section 27-1-221, MCA, leads to the conclusion the \u201cactual fraud\u201d required by that statute as a condition precedent to a punitive damage determination, anticipates proof of intent to harm by the false representation or concealment of material fact.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b171-7\">The District Court also cited <em>H-D Irrigating, Inc. v. Kimble Props., Inc., </em>2000 MT 212, 301 Mont. 34, 8 P.3d 95, and concluded that \u201cthe tort of negligent misrepresentation precludes a finding and conclusion actual fraud was committed.\u201d Hallenberg points out that <em>H-D Irrigating </em>in turn relied on <em>State ex rel. State Compensation Mut. Ins. Fund v. Berg </em>(1996), 279 Mont. 161, 927 P.2d 975, and he crafts his argument based upon this Court\u2019s analysis of fraud and constructive fraud in those two cases. However, the <em>H-D Irrigating </em>and <em>Berg </em>decisions addressed claims of fraud and constructive fraud as defined in Title 28, Chapter 2, Montana Code Annotated. Section 27-1-221(4), MCA, governing punitive damages, provides that the \u201ccontract definitions of fraud expressed in Title 28, Chapter 2, do not apply to proof of actual fraud under this section.\u201d At issue here is the distinctive definition of \u201cactual fraud\u201d under \u00a7 27-1-221(3), MCA, which applies only to the consideration of punitive damages and does not define-or affect the definition of-the underlying tort.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b172-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>\u00b621 Due to the confusion exhibited by the District Court and Hallenberg regarding the differing definitions of \u201cactual fraud,\u201d Hallenberg\u2019s argument plausibly could .be construed such that he is contending that the District Court erred by not awarding him compensatory damages for actual fraud as defined in Title 28, Chapter 2, Montana Code Annotated. However, Hallenberg requests specific relief from this Court: \u201c[I]t is respectfully requested that the Court reverse the trial Court\u2019s determination there was no actual fraud and direct the trial Court to determine punitive damages.\u201d This request indicates that Hallenberg\u2019s argument is directed to actual fraud as defined in Title 27, not Title 28, and we so construe it.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-4\">\u00b622 It is clear from the District Court\u2019s analysis that its interpretation and application of \u00a7 27-1-221, MCA, was erroneously influenced by case law relevant to the definitions of fraud and constructive fraud for claims brought under Title 28. Therefore, we remand to the District Court for reconsideration of Hallenberg\u2019s punitive damage claim based on actual fraud as defined in \u00a7 27-1-221, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-5\">\u00b623 Did the District Court err by failing to find General Mills guilty of actual malice required for punitive damages?</p>\n<p id=\"b172-6\">\u00b624 Section 27-1-221(2), MCA, defines \u201cactual malice\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b172-7\">A defendant is guilty of actual malice if the defendant has knowledge of facts or intentionally disregards facts that create a high probability of injury to the plaintiff and:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b172-8\">(a) deliberately proceeds to act in conscious or intentional disregard of the high probability of injury to the plaintiff; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b172-9\">(b) deliberately proceeds to act with indifference to the high probability of injury to the plaintiff.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b172-10\">\u00b625 Hallenberg contends that the District Court erred by concluding that he failed to plead actual malice. Additionally, Hallenberg argues that the District Court erred by concluding that \u201ceven if actual malice could be considered\u201d the claim still fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-11\">\u00b626 In a pretrial order issued pursuant to Rule 16, M.R.Civ.P., Hallenberg\u2019s contentions included the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b172-12\">[D]ue to General Mills\u2019 malicious acts in purposely deceiving Hallenberg regarding the grain and then insisting that he pay for cleaning and treating grain that was not his, General Mills is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>liable to Hallenberg for an additional $500,000.00.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b173-3\">In addition, the pretrial order listed as \u201cISSUES OF FACT\u201d the following: \u201cWhether General Mills\u2019 actions constitute actual fraud or actual malice,\u201d and \u201cWhat punitive damages should be awarded Hallenberg.\u201d Taken together, these portions of the pretrial order are sufficient to operate as a pleading of actual malice. <em>See Nentwig v. United Indus. </em>(1992), 256 Mont. 134, 138-40, 845 P.2d 99, 102-03 (pretrial orders should be liberally construed, and district court decisions in this context are reviewed for abuse of discretion).</p>\n<p id=\"b173-4\">\u00b627  However, our conclusion that Hallenberg pled actual malice is not fatal to the District Court\u2019s ultimate conclusion that Hallenberg failed to prove actual malice. The District Court found that \u201cGeneral Mills\u2019 personnel assumed Hallenberg was planting Fortuna, as Fortuna was a commonly planted variety of spring wheat in the Toole and Glacier counties area,\u201d and this finding is supported by substantial credible evidence. Thus, General Mills acted under the presumption that <em>no injury </em>would result in its misrepresentation to Hallenberg that the seed he was going to plant was in fact the same seed he had delivered. Accordingly, we conclude that General Mills neither had knowledge of facts nor intentionally disregarded facts that created a high probability of injury to Hallenberg. The District Court did not err by failing to find General Mills guilty of actual malice.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-5\">\u00b628 Diet the District Court err by failing to awarcl further compensatory damages?</p>\n<p id=\"b173-6\">\u00b629 Hallenberg argues that he sustained damages beyond loss of crop production in 1999. Hallenberg contends that he should have been awarded damages for the following categories of losses incurred by General Mills\u2019 negligence: crop loss in 2000, including the loss from land that was fallow and allegedly became contaminated by the shelling of the Fortuna seed; the cost of additional seed in 2000; additional loans and interest incurred in 1999, 2000, 2001, and 2002; and tilling, spraying, and labor costs associated with cleaning up the 1999 damage.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-7\">\u00b630 Hallenberg correctly points out that the District Court\u2019s order simply did not address these claims to damages. Accordingly, we remand the cause for further proceedings on these matters.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-8\">\u00b631 Hallenberg also argues that the District Court erred by finding the evidence at trial to be insufficient to permit an award of damages for losses related to decreased crop insurance payments.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-9\">\u00b632  \u201cRecovery of damages will not be denied, even if the mathematical precision of the figure is challenged, provided the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>evidence is sufficient to afford a reasonable basis for determining the specific amount awarded.\u201d <em>Cremer v. Cremer Rodeo Land &amp; Livestock Co. </em>(1981), 192 Mont. 208, 214, 627 P.2d 1199, 1202. However, \u201c[s]peculative damages not clearly ascertainable are not recoverable.\u201d <em>Albers v. Bar ZF Ranch </em>(1987), 229 Mont. 396, 404, 747 P.2d 1347, 1352.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-4\">\u00b633  Here, a review of the record reveals that there was evidence disputing the accuracy of Hallenberg\u2019s claims to losses of crop insurance payments. For example, General Mills put on evidence that tended to show that Hallenberg\u2019s crop insurance reports in years subsequent to 1999 contained errors. Because we \u201cwill not reweigh conflicting evidence or second guess the District Court\u2019s assessment of the credibility of the evidence,\u201d <em>In re </em>M.T., 2002 MT 174, \u00b6 30, 310 Mont. 506, \u00b6 30, 51 P.3d 1141, \u00b6 30, we conclude that the District Court did not err by refusing to award damages for lost crop insurance payments. <em>See In re Marriage of Mease, </em>2004 MT 59, \u00b6 42, 320 Mont. 229, \u00b6 42, 92 P.3d 1148, \u00b6 42 (district court properly denied request for damages because plaintiff failed to provide the court with proper proof).</p>\n<p id=\"b174-5\">\u00b634 Did the District Court err by concluding that Hallenberg suffered a sixteen bushel per acre loss in 1999?</p>\n<p id=\"b174-6\">\u00b635 General Mills makes alternative arguments regarding the bushel per acre loss Hallenberg suffered in 1999. First, General Mills argues that the evidence showed that the mixed seed was planted on roughly seventy-seven to one hundred acres, not 320 acres. Alternatively, General Mills argues that the yield from the unmixed acreage was lower than what the District Court concluded. General Mills asserts that Hallenberg\u2019s expert witness, Gary Richter (Richter), provided the only evidence properly admitted at trial (see \u00b6\u00b6 38-39 below) that could lead the District Court to calculate a thirty-six bushel per acre yield from the unmixed acreage. However, General Mills contends that its expert witness, Dan Roddy (Roddy), wholly discredited Richter\u2019s analysis. According to General Mills, either argument leads to the conclusion that the finding of a sixteen bushel per acre loss was not supported by substantial credible evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-7\">\u00b636 There was conflicting testimony regarding the acreage planted and the yield from the mixed and unmixed areas. Hallenberg testified during his case-in-chief that he planted the mixed seed on 320 acres, and he estimated-again during his case-in-chief-that, based on the size of the tanks in his combine, he was harvesting approximately twenty-two bushels per acre from the mixed seed area and thirty-six <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>bushels per acre on the unmixed area. Richter testified that the unmixed acres should have yielded approximately forty bushels per acre. However, Roddy\u2019s testimony brought Hallenberg\u2019s and Richter\u2019s numbers into question.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-3\">\u00b637 \u201cWe will not second guess the district court\u2019s determination regarding the strength and weight of conflicting <em>testimony.\u201d Double AA Corp. v. Newland &amp; Co. </em>(1995), 273 Mont. 486, 494, 905 P.2d 138, 142; <em>see also In re M.T., </em>\u00b6 30. Therefore, we cannot conclude that the District Court\u2019s findings that the mixed seed was planted on 320 acres and that Hallenberg suffered a sixteen bushel per acre loss on that land in 1999 were not based on substantial credible evidence. <em>See Moore v. Beye, </em>2005 MT 266, \u00b6 8, 329 Mont. 109, \u00b6 8, 122 P.3d 1212, \u00b6 8 (\u201cEven inherently weak and conflicted evidence may still be considered substantial.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b175-4\">\u00b638 Didl the District Court err by allowing Hallenberg to present evidence after he had rested his case-in-chief?</p>\n<p id=\"b175-5\">\u00b639 General Mills devotes a substantial portion of its briefing to its argument that the District Court improperly admitted certain exhibits, numbered 39 and 40, as rebuttal evidence. General Mills implies that, absent this rebuttal evidence, the District Court\u2019s findings regarding the per bushel loss Hallenberg suffered are not supported by substantial credible evidence. We need not address this issue, however, because, as we describe in \u00b6\u00b6 34-37 above, Hallenberg\u2019s case-in-chief evidence was sufficient to support the District Court\u2019s conclusions.</p>\n<p id=\"Ad\">\u00b640 Did the District Court err by finding the per bushel value of the lost production to be $3.60?</p>\n<p id=\"b175-6\">\u00b641 General Mills asserts with minimal citation to the record that Hallenberg provided no basis for the District Court to conclude that the per bushel value for the lost yield was $3.60. However, in testimony at trial, Hallenberg\u2019s expert, Richter, explained how he arrived at that value.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-7\">\u00b642 Without further articulation from General Mills regarding how and why Hallenberg\u2019s asserted value for the lost production fails, we cannot conclude that the District Court erred in its finding. Therefore, we affirm the District Court\u2019s ruling on the per bushel value of the lost wheat.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-8\">\u00b643 Did the District Court abuse its discretion by qualifying Richter as an expert or by awarding prejudgment interest?</p>\n<p id=\"b175-9\">\u00b644 General Mills makes cursory arguments contending that Richter was not qualified to testify regarding \u201cantagonism or competition\u201d between Fortuna and 936 and that Hallenberg\u2019s belated introduction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>of evidence showing more production than previously asserted demonstrates that he was not entitled to prejudgment interest. These conclusory assertions are presented without cognizable legal analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"Aq_\">\u00b645 \u201cUnder Rule 23, M.R.App.P., it is not this Court\u2019s obligation to conduct legal research on appellant\u2019s behalf, to guess as to his precise position, or to develop legal analysis that may lend support to his position.\u201d <em>In re Estate of Bayers, </em>1999 MT 154, \u00b6 19, 295 Mont. 89, \u00b6 19, 983 P.2d 339, \u00b6 19. In the absence of understandable and cogent analysis that supports General Mills\u2019 position on these issues, we cannot conclude that the District Court erred with respect to either of them. Therefore, we affirm the District Court\u2019s order on these issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-4\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b176-5\">\u00b646  The District Court erred by failing to enter a judgment with respect to Hallenberg\u2019s crop losses in 2000, including the loss from land that was fallow and allegedly became contaminated by the shelling of the Fortuna seed; the cost of additional seed in 2000; additional loans and interest incurred in 1999, 2000, 2001, and 2002; and tilling, spraying, and labor costs associated with cleaning up the 1999 damage. Therefore, we remand the cause for determination of the damages due, if any, on these matters. In addition, we remand for reconsideration of Hallenberg\u2019s punitive damage claim based on actual fraud as defined in \u00a7 27-1-221, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-6\">\u00b647  The District Court correctly concluded that General Mills did not commit actual malice.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-7\">\u00b648  The District Court did not err in its findings regarding the per acre loss and the value per bushel of the lost production.
