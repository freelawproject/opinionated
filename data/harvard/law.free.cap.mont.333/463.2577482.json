They had two children together before they married in 1986. Wayne filed for divorce in June 2003. Among other things, Jean sought retroactive premarital child support and a substantial portion of Wayne\u2019s monthly retirement benefits. The District Court granted both. Wayne appeals. We reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-9\">ISSUES</p>\n<p id=\"b488-10\">\u00b62 A restatement of the issues on appeal is:</p>\n<p id=\"b488-11\">\u00b63 Was the District Court\u2019s award of premarital child support barred by the ten-year statute of limitations applicable to judgments?</p>\n<p id=\"b488-12\">\u00b64 Did the District Court err in its division of Wayne\u2019s retirement benefits?</p>\n<p id=\"b488-13\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b488-14\">\u00b65 Wayne and Jean Momsen\u2019s first child was born on December 2, 1981. Their second child was bom on December 4, 1985. Wayne and Jean were not married to each other during this time nor, with the exception of a few weeks, did they live together during these years. They began living together on December 7,1985, and were married on September 27,1986. The parties separated on May 9,2003, and Wayne filed for divorce on June 25, 2003. A trial was held on February 4, 2004. During the trial, Jean testified regarding her request for premarital child support for the period of time between their first child\u2019s birth on December 2, 1981, and December 1985, when they began living together as a family. Wayne\u2019s attorney argued that the relevant ten-year statute of limitations precluded such a premarital child support award. At the close of trial, the District Court instructed the parties\u2019 attorneys to submit briefs on the applicability of the statute of limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-15\">\u00b66 Subsequently, the District Court awarded premarital child support to Jean in the amount of $12,960.00. The court did not address Wayne\u2019s statute of limitations argument in its order but stated that it was relying on \u201cprinciples of equity.\u201d In its Findings of Fact, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>Conclusions of Law and Decree of Dissolution and Order, the court granted Wayne\u2019s request for divorce and divided the marital property. The District Court found that Wayne received a pension check of $4,022.00 per month, and that from this sum, Jean was entitled to a monthly amount of $1,126.16. Wayne appeals both the District Court\u2019s award of premarital child support and the court\u2019s findings and conclusions relative to his monthly pension benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-4\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b489-5\">\u00b67 We traditionally review a district court\u2019s award of child support to determine whether the district court abused its discretion. <em>See In re Marriage of Noble, </em>2005 MT 113, \u00b6 12, 327 Mont. 95, \u00b6 12, 112 P.3d 267, \u00b6 12 (citations omitted). However, in the case before us the challenge to the child support award is based on the statute of limitations. Whether a district court correctly applied the statute of limitations is a question of law. <em>Hollister v. Forsythe, </em>270 Mont. 91, 93, 889 P.2d 1205, 1206 (1995). We review a district court\u2019s conclusions of law to determine whether the court\u2019s interpretation of the law is correct. <em>Carbon County v. Union Reserve Coal Co., Inc., </em>271 Mont. 459, 469, 898 P.2d 680, 686 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b489-6\">\u00b68 The distribution of marital property in a dissolution action is governed by \u00a7 40-4-202, MCA, which provides in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-7\">In a proceeding for dissolution of a marriage, legal separation, or division of property following a decree of dissolution ... the court, without regard to marital misconduct, shall ... finally equitably apportion between the parties the property and assets belonging to either or both, however and whenever acquired and whether the title thereto is in the name of husband or wife or both ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"APi\">Section 40-4-202(1), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-8\">\u00b69 A district court\u2019s findings of fact regarding the division of marital property will be upheld unless the relevant findings are clearly erroneous. If a district court\u2019s judgment is supported by substantial credible evidence, it will not be disturbed absent an abuse of discretion. <em>In re Marriage of Meeks, </em>276 Mont. 237, 242-43, 915 P.2d 831, 834 (1996) (internal citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b489-9\">DISCUSSION ISSUE ONE</p>\n<p id=\"b489-10\">\u00b610 Was <em>the District Court\u2019s award of premarital child support barred by the ten-year statute of limitations applicable to judgments </em>?</p>\n<p id=\"b489-11\">\u00b611 Wayne argues that the statute of limitations established in \u00a7 27-2-201(1), MCA, precludes an award of child support to Jean for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>period of time between December 1981 and December 1985. Relying on <em>In re Marriage of (Crittendon) Hooper, </em>247 Mont. 322, 806 P.2d 541 (1991), he maintains that had he been subject to an order to pay child support, each obliged payment would have become a final judgment debt at the time it was due. Additionally, he posits that the latest date upon which any owed child support debt was due would have been at the time he and Jean married in September 1986. As a result, the ten-year period of limitations expired in September 1996.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-4\">\u00b612 In <em>Hooper, </em>after seven years of marriage, the Crittendons divorced in 1973. Mother (who later changed her name and the childrens\u2019 names to Hooper) got custody of the couple\u2019s children, ages six and one, and was awarded monthly child support. Father made some payments but then stopped. Mother made a few attempts to collect from Father but was unsuccessful. Father ceased contact with his children and later testified he had done so at Hooper\u2019s request in exchange for nonpayment of child support. In 1990, Mother was awarded $23,250.00 in child support arrearages. Father appealed, arguing that the statute of limitations had run. We agreed, in reliance upon the prevailing trend in other jurisdictions, and held that the statute of limitations applicable to judgments will bar enforcement of delinquent child support obligations which fall outside the statutory limit. <em>Hooper, </em>247 Mont. at 326-27, 806 P.2d at 544. The <em>Hooper </em>Court explained,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-5\">These courts [in other jurisdictions] reason that since each child support payment becomes a separate, final judgment as of its date of accrual, the statute of limitations pertaining to final judgments applies.... The Montana Supreme Court has stated that each child support payment \u201cbecomes a judgment debt similar to any other judgment for money.\u201d <em>In re Marriage of Sabo </em>(1986), 224 Mont. 252, 254, 730 P.2d 1112, 1113. Thus, the ten-year statute of limitations for actions upon court judgments or decrees, \u00a7 27-2-201(1), MCA, applies to actions by one parent against the other for child support arrearages.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b490-6\"><em>Hooper, </em>247 Mont. at 327, 806 P.2d at 544 (internal citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"Aa-\">\u00b613 Jean counters that because it was undisputed that Wayne was the child\u2019s father, he was liable for child support, presumably regardless of whether or not a court ordered it. She relies on several cases from other jurisdictions holding that a valid, enforceable child support claim, though not enforceable during the pendency of the marriage, is nonetheless not extinguished by the remarriage of the parties, and is actionable at the time the marriage dissolves. <em>See, e.g., Greene v. Iowa Dist. Court for Polk County, </em>312 N.W.2d 915 (Iowa 1981) and <em>In re Marriage of Root, </em>774 S.W.2d 521 (Mo. App. 1989). Jean argues that, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>in accord with these cases, her claim for child support, though unenforceable during the time she and Wayne were married, was a \u201cvested right\u201d that could not be taken away, and was revived at the time they were divorced.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-4\">\u00b614 The District Court ruled that Wayne must pay retroactive child support based on the strong policy argument that a father has a responsibility to support his child, even without a court order. Without expressly stating it, the court apparently adopted Jean\u2019s argument that the parties\u2019 interim marriage tolled the statute of limitations which was revived upon their divorce. The District Court rationalized, \u201c[T]here is no logical or equitable basis to allow a parent to incur an obligation (premarital child support), then marry to avoid enforcement of the obligation (by evaporation of the claim or running of the statutes of limitation) and then terminate the marriage relationship once he has purportedly avoided the obligation altogether.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b491-5\">\u00b615  We disagree and hold that the ten-year statute of limitations established in \u00a7 27-2-201, MCA, bars Jean\u2019s claim for premarital child support. We note that at no time between the birth of the child in December 1981 and the parties\u2019 marriage in December 1985 was an order of child support issued imposing support obligations on Wayne. Nor is there any reference in the record to Jean seeking such an order. While Wayne may have had a moral obligation to support his child, under the laws in effect at the time he did not have a legally-imposed obligation. Given that a statute of limitations can bar a claim for child support against a person with a legally-imposed obligation, as we held in <em>Hooper, </em>it should also bar a claim against a person who had no legal obligation.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-6\">\u00b616 Moreover, we note that the child for whom child support was sought was twenty-three years old at the time of her parents\u2019 dissolution trial, and was an emancipated adult no longer residing with her mother.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-7\">\u00b617  The District Court\u2019s failure to apply the statute of limitations was incorrect. We reverse the District Court\u2019s award of pre-marital child support to Jean.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-8\">ISSUE TWO</p>\n<p id=\"b491-9\">\u00b618 <em>Did the District Court err in its division of Wayne\u2019s retirement benefits?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b491-10\">\u00b619 The District Court found that Wayne received a monthly pension from the U.S. Postal Service of $4,022.00. Applying the \u201ctime rule formula,\u201d it also found that Wayne worked for thirty years to obtain this pension and that for seventeen of those thirty years, or 56% of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>time, he was married to Jean. The court therefore calculated that 56% of Wayne\u2019s monthly pension totaling $2,252.32 was marital property. It then awarded Jean one-half of this amount, or a monthly amount of $1,126.16.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-4\">\u00b620 Wayne does not dispute that Jean is entitled to a marital portion of his benefits but maintains that the District Court erred when it calculated Jean\u2019s share using a gross benefit amount that he does not actually receive. The confusion stems from an affidavit filed shortly after Wayne filed his Petition for Dissolution. In this affidavit Wayne presented his monthly income and a list of his monthly deductions and expenses. He claimed that his \u201cgross earned income\u201d from his government retirement check was $4,022.00. He then subtracted $410.00-the amount automatically deducted as a result of his election to provide Jean a spousal survivor annuity-from this amount. He also indicated that $220.00 was deducted monthly for health insurance, $440.00 for federal taxes, and $150.00 for state taxes. As a result of these automatic deductions, Wayne claimed that his net pension check deposited monthly totaled $2,792.00. He argued that it was error for the court to use the $4,022.00 gross amount rather than the $2,792.00 net amount.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-5\">\u00b621 Jean responds that because Wayne\u2019s pension benefits arise from federal employment, Title 5 of the United States Code and Title 5 part 838 of the Code of Federal Regulations (C.F.R.) addressing \u201ccourt orders affecting retirement benefits\u201d governs. She asserts that the District Court\u2019s distribution complies with the federal rules and should not be disturbed.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-6\">\u00b622 Title 5, part 838.103 of the C.F.R. defines terms relevant to our analysis:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-7\"><em>Self-only annuity </em>means the recurring unreduced payments under [Civil Service Retirement System] CSRS or [Federal Employees Retirement System] FERS to a retiree with no survivor annuity payable to anyone.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-8\"><em>Gross annuity </em>means the amount of monthly annuity payable after reducing the self-only annuity to provide survivor annuity benefits, if any, but before any other deduction.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-9\"><em>Net annuity </em>means the amount of monthly annuity payable after deducting from the gross annuity any amounts that are-</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-10\">(1) Owed by the retiree to the United States;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-11\">(2) Deducted for health benefits premiums under section 8906 of title 5, United States Code, and \u00a7\u00a7 891.401 and 891.402 of this chapter;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-12\">(3) Deducted for life insurance premiums under section 8714a(d) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>of title 5, United States Code;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-4\">(4) Deducted for Medicare premiums;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-5\">(5) Properly withheld for Federal income tax purposes, if the amounts withheld are not greater than they would be if the retiree claimed all dependents to which he or she was entitled;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-6\">(6) Properly withheld for State income tax purposes, if the amounts withheld are not greater than they would be if the retiree claimed all dependents to which he or she was entitled; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-7\">(7) Already payable to another person based on a court order acceptable for processing or a child abuse judgment enforcement order.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b493-8\">\u00b623 As noted by Jean, the federal rules provide detailed instruction on procedures for processing court orders affecting employee annuities and awarding former spouse survivor annuities. 5 C.F.R. part 838. Relevant to our analysis, we note that the rules indicate that \u201c[a]ll court orders that do not specify net annuity or self-only annuity apply to gross annuity.\u201d 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 838.625(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b493-9\">\u00b624 The record in the case before us reveals that at the time Wayne selected his retirement benefits, he could have selected the \u201cself-only annuity\u201d or he could elect to provide Jean with a spouse survivor annuity. When a retiree (or annuitant) elects the self-only annuity, he or she gets the maximum amount offered under the plan but all payments stop when the annuitant dies. However, if the annuitant elects to provide a \u201csurvivor annuity,\u201d the retiree gets a smaller monthly benefit, but the retiree\u2019s survivor gets continued payments after the retiree dies. Wayne elected a smaller monthly benefit amount in order to provide Jean with a survivor annuity.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-10\">\u00b625 Presumably, in an effort to display to the court the amount of retirement benefit he had sacrificed in order to provide Jean with a survivor annuity, Wayne indicated in his affidavit that his \u201cgross earned income\u201d was $4,022.00 but that $410.00 was deducted each month in order to provide benefits to Jean after his death. In reality, as of the time Wayne opted to forego a \u201cself-only annuity\u201d and to provide survivor annuity benefits to Jean, his \u201cgross annuity\u201d benefit, as defined above, became $3,612.00 per month. In other words, Wayne never received $4,022.00 per month in retirement income. As a result it was error for the District Court to use this amount in its pension-dividing calculation.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-11\">\u00b626 Additionally, Wayne argues that his check is further reduced by health insurance premiums and federal and state taxes automatically taken out of his check before he receives it. Relying on <em>Meeks, </em>Wayne maintains that the District Court should have calculated Jean\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>monthly benefits using Wayne\u2019s \u201cnet annuity.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b494-4\">\u00b627 In previous cases, we have considered two methods for establishing values of pension plans: (1) the present value method (lump sum distribution); and (2) the time rule method (deferred distribution). <em>In re Marriage of Swanson, </em>2004 MT 124, \u00b6 21, 321 Mont. 250, \u00b6 21, 90 P.3d 418, \u00b6 21. While we have said that \u201c[generally, the proper test for determining the value of a pension is the present value,\u201d <em>(see Rolfe v. Rolfe, </em>234 Mont. 294, 297, 766 P.2d 223, 225 (1988)), we have also held that a district court did not abuse its discretion when applying the time rule method. <em>See In re Marriage of Truax, </em>271 Mont. 122, 126, 894 P.2d 936, 938 (1995), and <em>In re Marriage of Robinson, </em>269 Mont. 293, 299, 888 P.2d 895, 898-99 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"A8V\">\u00b628  In the present case, the District Court elected to use the time rule formula. The \u201ctime rule formula,\u201d as defined in <em>Meeks, </em>is \u201cyears of service during the marriage divided by years of total service multiplied by the monthly benefit <em>(after </em>taxes) times one-half.\u201d <em>Meeks, </em>276 Mont. at 246, 915 P.2d at 837 (emphasis added). <em>See also Rolfe, 234 </em>Mont. at 298, 766 P.2d at 226. In the case at bar, the District Court utilized all factors of the <em>Meeks </em>time rule formula except the \u201cafter taxes\u201d factor. We note that in <em>Rolfe </em>and <em>Meeks, </em>we expressly stated that the monthly benefit amount to be used in the calculation was the \u201cafter tax\u201d amount. We acknowledge, however, that in <em>Truax </em>and <em>Robinson, </em>we did not so state. Nor did we include the \u201cafter tax\u201d distinction in our most recent case discussion of the \u201ctime rule formula\u201d in <em>Swanson. </em>We conclude today that the more equitable method is to utilize a retiree\u2019s net annuity in \u201ctime rule formula\u201d calculations.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-5\">\u00b629  Having determined that the District Court erroneously used the \u201cself-only annuity\u2019 benefit amount, we reverse the court\u2019s division of Wayne\u2019s pension and remand to the District Court for re-calculation of Jean\u2019s marital portion based upon Wayne\u2019s net annuity as defined at 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 838.103.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-6\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b494-7\">\u00b630 For the foregoing reasons, we reverse the District Court\u2019s award of retroactive child support to Jean. We also reverse the court\u2019s division of Wayne\u2019s monthly retirement benefits and remand for further proceedings consistent with this Opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b494-8\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES NELSON and LEAPHART concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
