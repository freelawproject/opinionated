The County filed a declaratory action in the District Court seeking a determination of which documents must be disclosed to the Gazette, and which documents should be shielded from public inspection in the interest of individual privacy. The District Court determined that all documents requested by the Gazette should be disclosed with some redactions, and denied the Gazette\u2019s request for costs and attorney fees. On appeal the Gazette seeks (1) access to the redacted portions of the Interim Chief Public Defender\u2019s deposition, and (2) costs and attorney fees. We reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-11\">ISSUES</p>\n<p id=\"b416-12\">\u00b62 The issues on appeal are:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-13\">1. Whether Montana\u2019s constitutional right to know gives the Gazette a right to inspect the entirety of the Interim Chief Public Defender\u2019s deposition testimony.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-14\">2. Whether the Gazette should receive costs and attorney fees for enforcing the public\u2019s right to know.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b416-15\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b416-16\">\u00b63 Various lawsuits brought against the County concerning the operation of Yellowstone County\u2019s Public Defenders Office (Office) spawned the dispute now before us. The facts underlying those cases are not at issue here, but are essential to understanding the case we now consider.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-17\">\u00b64 Yellowstone County\u2019s Chief Public Defender, Sanford Selvey II (Selvey), resigned due in part to misconduct by Selvey toward Sarah Schopfer (Schopfer), an investigator who worked in the Office. Roberta Drew (Drew), then-Deputy Chief Defender, applied to be Interim Chief Defender, but the County hired Curtis Bevolden (Bevolden) instead. Bevolden later fired Drew. Consequently Drew initiated an internal County grievance proceeding which culminated in her reinstatement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>as Deputy Chief Public Defender. Drew then filed a human rights complaint against the County, and also a federal discrimination suit against the County, Bevolden, and three other county officials not involved in this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-3\">\u00b65 The Gazette, a newspaper based in Billings, Montana, reported on the complaints filed by Schopfer and Drew and the ensuing litigation as it developed. Accordingly, the Gazette served the County with several Freedom of Information Act requests seeking documentation related to the County\u2019s management of the Office and the expenditure of public funds for purposes of resolving Schopfer\u2019s and Drew\u2019s claims against county officials and employees. On February 6, 2003, the Gazette requested from the County copies of all public records documenting Selvey\u2019s, Schopfer\u2019s, and Drew\u2019s \u201cclassification, status, salary, hire date, promotion, adverse actions, and formal complaints,\u201d in addition to \u201crecords of employee evaluations.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b417-4\">\u00b66 In response, on February 18, 2003, the County filed the declaratory judgment action which led to this appeal. In its complaint, the County named the Gazette, Selvey, Schopfer, and Drew as defendants and asked the District Court to \u201cbalance the public\u2019s right to know and to examine public documents with the right of privacy maintained by the three individual defendants and determine, what if any documentation in the possession of [the County], should be given to the Billings Gazette.\u201d For the next 18 months, the County took no action in the District Court to resolve its claim except to dismiss Drew as a defendant. Meanwhile, the Gazette continued to actively pursue production of the disputed documents and resolution of the conflict underlying the County\u2019s declaratory action.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-5\">\u00b67 Pending resolution of the County\u2019s claim, informal negotiations among the parties ensued. Drew and Selvey voluntarily provided their personnel files to the Gazette and the County produced several nonsensitive documents. Then, the Gazette learned that Bevolden and several other County officials had been deposed by the County during discovery in Drew\u2019s federal discrimination suit. The Gazette asked for copies of the deposition transcripts.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-6\">\u00b68 The Gazette first requested copies of Bevolden\u2019s transcripts on September 24, 2003. On October 24, 2003, County\u2019s counsel wrote to the Gazette\u2019s attorney, \u201cPlease be advised that I am having the depositions of... Mr. Bevolden ... [and others] copied at the present time and I will be sending you the transcripts shortly.\u201d On November 18, 2003, however, the County reversed course and informed the Gazette the depositions would not be produced. Drew objected to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>disclosure of some of the requested deposition transcripts due to Drew\u2019s and her clients\u2019 privacy interests. No objection was raised to disclosure of Bevolden\u2019s deposition. The Gazette maintained that Drew\u2019s objection had no legal bearing on the County\u2019s obligation to produce the requested documents.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-4\">\u00b69 The Gazette filed a Motion to Compel on January 14,2004, as the depositions had not been produced. The proceeding was then briefly delayed for lack of a judge to hear the case. Then, the Gazette claims that at a scheduling conference in the District Court on March 17, 2004, the County again committed to provide copies of the depositions still in dispute, but then again reneged on that commitment. The County does not deny having agreed to produce the transcripts, but explains that each time deposition transcripts were about to be produced Drew, Selvey, and/or Schopfer threatened to sue the County for violation of their privacy rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-5\">\u00b610 Nearly eight months later, on August 6, 2004, the County produced redacted copies of Bevolden\u2019s deposition less than an hour before the District Court\u2019s hearing on the Gazette\u2019s Motion to Compel. The District Court had not previously reviewed Bevolden\u2019s deposition or any of the other depositions subject to the Motion, nor had it approved any redactions from the transcript.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-6\">\u00b611 On November 5, 2004, the District Court granted the Gazette\u2019s Motion to Compel and ordered the County to produce in full all of the documents still in dispute \u201cexcepting only the ... portions wherein the individual right of privacy of non-parties outweighs the public right to know ....\u201d The District Court authorized redactions of five pages from Bevolden\u2019s deposition testimony given in Drew\u2019s federal discrimination case against Bevolden for Drew\u2019s wrongful termination as Chief Deputy Public Defender. The District Court further ordered the parties to pay their own attorney fees. The District Court made no findings of fact to support its Order.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-7\">\u00b612 The Gazette appeals from the District Court\u2019s authorization of redactions from Bevolden\u2019s deposition testimony, and from denial of the Gazette\u2019s request for attorney fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-8\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b418-9\">\u00b613 We review a district court\u2019s conclusion of law regarding a constitutional question to determine whether it is correct. <em>Bryan v. District, </em>2002 MT 264, \u00b6 16, 312 Mont. 257, \u00b6 16, 60 P.3d 381, \u00b6 16.</p>\n<p id=\"A45\">\u00b6 14 An award of attorney fees is discretionary, and therefore a district court\u2019s denial of attorney fees is reviewed for an abuse of discretion. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number><em>Investigative Records of City of Columbus Pol. Dept. </em>(1995), 272 Mont. 486, 488, 901 P.2d 565, 566-67.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-3\">DISCUSSION ISSUE ONE</p>\n<p id=\"b419-4\">\u00b615 <em>1. Whether the public has a right to inspect the entirety of the Interim Chief Public Defender\u2019s deposition testimony.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b419-5\">\u00b616 On appeal the Gazette objects to the District Court\u2019s determinations regarding only one contested deposition, that of Interim Chief Public Defender Bevolden. In reviewing the District Court\u2019s authorization of redactions from Bevolden\u2019s deposition, we must decide (1) whether Bevolden has a privacy interest in his own deposition testimony which clearly outweighs the public\u2019s right to be informed of all of the deposition\u2019s contents, and (2) whether the non-party individuals discussed by Bevolden in his deposition have privacy interests which prevent public disclosure of the deposition\u2019s contents.</p>\n<p id=\"Aqz\">\u00b617  The Montana Constitution at Article II, Section 9 grants the public\u2019s right to know:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-6\">Section 9. Right to know. No person shall be deprived of the right to examine documents or to observe the deliberations of all public bodies or agencies of state government and its subdivisions, except in cases in which the demand of individual privacy clearly exceeds the merits of public disclosure.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b419-7\">Corresponding statutes protect public access to government documents, including \u00a7 2-6-102(1), MCA, which provides, \u201cEvery citizen has a right to inspect and take a copy of any public writing of this state....\u201d We have previously concluded that the rights granted by the right to know provision extends not only to individuals, but also to media entities. <em>Jefferson County v. Montana Standard, </em>2003 MT 304, \u00b6 13, 318 Mont. 173, \u00b6 13, 79 P.3d 805, \u00b6 13 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b419-8\">\u00b618 As stated in <em>Becky v. Butte-Silver Bow Sch. Dist. 1 </em>(1995), 274 Mont. 131, 136, 906 P.2d 193, 196, and reiterated in <em>Bryan, </em>\u00b6 33:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-9\">Any review of Article II, Section 9, of the Montana Constitution necessarily involves a three-step process. First, we consider whether the provision applies to the particular political subdivision against whom enforcement is sought. Second, we determine whether the documents in question are \u201cdocuments of public bodies\u201d subject to public inspection. Finally, if the first two requirements are satisfied, we decide whether a privacy interest is present, and if so, whether the demand of individual privacy clearly exceeds the merits of public disclosure.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b420-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>In the instant case, the County does not dispute that it is a political subdivision against which the right to know provision is enforceable. Neither does the County contest that Bevolden\u2019s deposition is a document of a public body subject to public inspection. As such, we turn our discussion to the final steps of the right to know test to determine (1) whether privacy interests are present, and (2) if so whether the demand for individual privacy clearly exceeds the merits of public disclosure.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-4\">\u00b619  It is well established that Montana\u2019s constitutional right to know is not absolute. <em>See Jefferson, </em>\u00b6 13, citing <em>Bozeman Daily Chronicle v. Police Dept. </em>(1993), 260 Mont. 218, 224, 859 P.2d 435, 439, and <em>In re Lacy </em>(1989), 239 Mont. 321, 325, 780 P.2d 186, 188. Public disclosure is not required in cases where the demand for individual privacy clearly exceeds the public\u2019s right to know. <em>Bryan, </em>\u00b6 33. The text of Montana\u2019s constitutional right to know provision is directly followed by the individual privacy right, found at Article II, Section 10 of the Montana Constitution, which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b420-5\">Section 10. Right of privacy. The right of individual privacy is essential to the well-being of a free society and shall not be infringed without the showing of a compelling state interest.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b420-6\">\u00b620  Determining whether public disclosure is required demands a balancing of the public\u2019s right to know with competing privacy interests \u201cin the context of the facts of each case <em>....\u2019\u2019Associated Press, Inc. v. Department, </em>2000 MT 160, \u00b6 24, 300 Mont. 233, \u00b6 24, 4 P.3d 5, \u00b6 24, quoting <em>Missoulian v. Board of Regents of Higher Educ. </em>(1984), 207 Mont. 513, 529, 675 P.2d 962, 971. To determine whether an individual has a protected privacy interest under Article II, Section 10, of the Montana Constitution we apply a two-part test. <em>Jefferson County, </em>\u00b6 15 (citation omitted). A constitutionally protected privacy interest exists when a person has a subjective or actual expectation of privacy that society is willing to recognize as reasonable. <em>Lincoln County Com\u2019n v. Nixon, </em>1998 MT 298, \u00b6 16, 292 Mont. 42, \u00b6 16, 968 P.2d 1141, \u00b6 16 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b420-7\">\u00b621  In this case, we first must determine whether Bevolden has a constitutionally protected privacy interest in the transcript of his deposition which society is willing to recognize as reasonable. We have previously determined that society is not willing to recognize as reasonable the privacy interest of individuals who hold positions of public trust when the information sought bears on that individual\u2019s ability to perform public duties. <em>See Great Falls Tribune v. Sherriff </em>(1989), 238 Mont. 103, 107, 775 P.2d 1267, 1269 (the public\u2019s right to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>know outweighed the privacy interests of three disciplined police officers in the public release of their names because police officers hold positions of \u201cgreat public trust\u201d); <em>Bozeman Daily Chronicle, </em>260 Mont. at 227, 859 P.2d at 440-41 (investigative documents associated with allegations of sexual intercourse without consent by an off-duty police officer were proper matters for public scrutiny because \u201csuch alleged misconduct went directly to the police officer\u2019s breach of his position of public trust...\u201d); and <em>Svaldi v. Anaconda-Deer Lodge County, </em>2005 MT 17, \u00b6 31, 325 Mont. 365, \u00b6 31, 106 P.3d 548, \u00b6 31 (a public school teacher entrusted with the care and instruction of children held a position of public trust and therefore the public had a right to view records from an investigation into the teacher\u2019s abuse of students).</p>\n<p id=\"ANR\">\u00b622 Public defenders, as the officers of our courts charged with safeguarding the public\u2019s fundamental constitutional rights to counsel and a fair and speedy trial, play an essential role in preserving public confidence in our judicial system and preserving these rights for every member of society. As Interim Chief Public Defender for Yellowstone County, Bevolden held a position of public trust. He was employed by the County and paid with public funds to provide effective legal counsel to indigent persons charged with crimes, and to direct and manage the Office in a manner conducive to ensuring that attorneys under his supervision also provided effective counsel to clients. Consequently, Bevolden\u2019s subjective expectation of privacy was diminished as to matters involving his performance of official duties as Interim Chief Public Defender. Moreover, there is no evidence in the record to suggest that Bevolden actively asserted a privacy interest in his deposition transcript.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-3\">\u00b623  We determine, after reviewing unedited copies of Bevolden\u2019s deposition, that the information contained in the redacted portions bears directly on Bevolden\u2019s professional judgment, the management decisions he made as Interim Chief Public Defender, and his official conduct. Therefore, the public\u2019s right to access Bevolden\u2019s deposition clearly outweighs any privacy interest he might otherwise assert in this material.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-4\">\u00b624  Next, we turn to the question of whether the non-party individuals discussed by Bevolden in his deposition have protected privacy interests in the portions of Bevolden\u2019s testimony redacted by the District Court. Again we apply the privacy test to determine whether the public\u2019s right to know clearly outweighs reasonable expectations of privacy that non-parties might have in Bevolden\u2019s testimony. The Gazette argues that the County raises for the first time <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>on appeal the privacy interests of non-party individuals. However, on review of the August 6, 2004 hearing transcript, we conclude that the County made arguments in the District Court which can reasonably be interpreted as asserting the privacy interests of non-parties. Also, we note that the Gazette agreed in the District Court, and has again agreed on appeal, to redaction of the names of non-parties in the interest of their privacy. We agree that redacting the names of non-parties from Bevolden\u2019s deposition is appropriate here. However, further redactions shielding more than the names of non-parties are not warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-4\">\u00b625 We have previously determined that redacting individuals\u2019 names from public records sufficiently protects their privacy, while still allowing disclosure of relevant public information, even in the context of criminal parole files. <em>See Worden v. Montana Bd. of Pardons and Parole, </em>1998 MT 168, \u00b6 29, 289 Mont. 459, \u00b6 29, 962 P.2d 1157, \u00b6 29 (omitting from parole files the names and addresses of letter writers protected privacy sufficiently to allow the public to view contents of letters). We have also interpreted the right to know as permitting access to the \u201cwidest breadth of information possible,\u201d even where the individuals whose privacy interests were implicated did not work in the public realm. <em>See Lincoln County Com\u2019n, </em>\u00b6 21, discussing <em>In re Lacy, </em>239 Mont. 321, 780 P.2d 186 (insurance company invoked the right to know to gain access to medical records of deceased insured held by the government).</p>\n<p id=\"b422-5\">\u00b626 The redacted portions of Bevolden\u2019s deposition clarify what Bevolden knew about the non-parties\u2019 work history and illuminate Bevolden\u2019s decision to hire them instead of Drew. Bevolden\u2019s hiring decisions, in light of his prior knowledge of the non-parties\u2019 job performance, were among the reasons Drew sued Bevolden and the County for discrimination. Bevolden\u2019s testimony therefore goes directly to Drew\u2019s claims. Notably, neither of the non-parties here asserted on their own behalf a privacy interest in Bevolden\u2019s testimony. Additionally, both of the non-parties named by Bevolden were public defender attorneys employed by the County and paid with public funds to represent indigent criminal defendants. It bears emphasis that even public employees in positions of public trust retain privacy interests in their personal information and conduct unrelated to their job performance. However, our inspection of Bevolden\u2019s deposition reveals that his discussion about non-parties was limited to his knowledge of those non-parties\u2019 job history and performance of official duties.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-6\">\u00b627  We conclude that on the facts presented here the public\u2019s right <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>to know about Bevolden\u2019s management of the Office and the quality of representation afforded by the Office under Bevolden\u2019s direction clearly outweighs any privacy interest non-parties may have in the redacted portions of Bevolden\u2019s testimony. Therefore, the public has a right to inspect the entirety of Bevolden\u2019s deposition so long as the names of the non-parties are withheld.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-4\">ISSUE TWO</p>\n<p id=\"b423-5\">\u00b628 <em>2. Whether the Gazette should receive costs and attorney fees for enforcing the public\u2019s right to know.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b423-6\">\u00b629 The Gazette appeals from the District Court\u2019s denial of its request for attorney fees, claiming that the County\u2019s conduct unnecessarily delayed access to public documents, thereby justifying an award of fees and costs. It further argues that the District Court abused its discretion when it failed to articulate in its Order its reasons for denying the Gazette an award of fees, and because the District Court has in essence allowed the County to misuse its court action without consequence. In response, the County argues that the District Court has the discretion to grant or deny an award of attorney fees and that the court did not abuse its discretion given the many reasons why it took eighteen months to resolve the disputes presented here.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-7\">\u00b630 We agree that an award of attorney fees is discretionary. <em>See Matter of Investigative Records </em>(1994), 265 Mont. 379, 382, 877 P.2d 470, 472 (where we reviewed the legislative history leading to the adoption of \u00a7 2-3-221, MCA, and concluded that \u201cthe clear intent of the statute is that an award of attorneys fees is discretionary\u201d and accordingly does not mandate attorney fee awards for prevailing parties in suits brought under Article II, Section 9 of the Montana Constitution). However, it is well-established that outright denial of a motion for attorney fees without rationale, is \u201cnot an exercise of discretion, but is an abuse of that discretion.\u201d <em>Matter of Investigative Records, </em>265 Mont. at 383, 877 P.2d at 472, citing <em>Gursky v. Parkside Professional Village </em>(1993), 258 Mont. 148, 152, 852 P.2d 569, 571. Moreover, we have previously held that due to the \u201cpublic benefits gained\u201d by the vindication of the public\u2019s right to know, the costs of litigation to secure these rights should be spread among beneficiaries. <em>Associated Press, Inc., </em>\u00b6 43.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-8\">\u00b631  We conclude that the District Court erred in denying the Gazette\u2019s motion for attorney fees without rationale. <em>Matter of Investigative Records, </em>265 Mont. at 383, 877 P.2d at 472. Further, we hold that the District Court\u2019s discretion to deny attorney fees in right <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>to know cases is not unfettered. Accordingly, we remand to the District Court for reconsideration of the Gazette\u2019s motion for attorney fees in light of the discussion set forth above.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-4\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b424-5\">\u00b632 For the foregoing reasons, we reverse the District Court\u2019s authorization of redactions which eliminate more than non-party names from Bevolden\u2019s deposition testimony, and reverse and remand for further consideration of the Gazette\u2019s request for attorney fees and entry of an order thereon with supporting rationale.</p>\n<judges id=\"b424-6\">JUSTICES NELSON, WARNER, MORRIS and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"Arh\">JUSTICE NELSON</author>\n<p id=\"AQ8\">concurs.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-7\">\u00b633 I concur in our decision. I write separately to state my agreement with the Gazette that we should hold that the District Court\u2019s discretion to deny attorney fees in right-to-know cases is not unfettered. Indeed, while discretionary, the award of attorney fees in right-to-know cases should be presumed, for the reasons set forth below.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-8\">\u00b634 The Gazette argues that the following factors must be taken into consideration in ruling on a fee request. This Court does not address these factors, presumably because the suggestion that we adopt them was raised in the Gazette\u2019s reply brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-9\">\u00b635 Nonetheless, I agree that these factors should be part of the District Court\u2019s calculus in determining whether to grant attorney fees in a right-to-know case. Specifically, the court should consider:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b424-10\">1. whether the governmental entity has produced undisputed portions of the requested materials;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b424-11\">2. whether the government has acted expeditiously to bring the dispute to resolution, including the provision of documents <em>in camera </em>for the district court\u2019s analysis;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b424-12\">3. whether the government has timely produced a production log detailing its objections to production;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b424-13\">4. the delay involved;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b424-14\">5. the extent to which the government\u2019s action in filing a declaratory judgment action is a pre-textual act designed to avoid timely production of the documents rather than an attempt to resolve legitimate disputes concerning privacy interests;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b424-15\">6. the extent to which privacy interests have been actually asserted by the affected parties; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b424-16\">7. the good faith of government officials in complying with the statutory and constitutional requirements of public inspection.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b425-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>\u00b636 There should be a presumption of awarding attorney fees to the prevailing plaintiff in right-to-know cases, and the process of making that award should be informed by use of the above standards for the following reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-3\">\u00b637 The right-to-know guarantees of Article II, Section 9, of the Montana Constitution,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> are among the most important guarantees that Montanans enjoy. As this right is contained in the Constitution\u2019s Declaration of Eights, it is a fundamental right. <em>State v. Tapson, </em>2001 MT 292, \u00b6 15, 307 Mont. 428, \u00b6 15, 41 P.3d 305, \u00b6 15. In interpreting this provision, we have held that there is a constitutional presumption that all documents of every kind in the hands of public officials are amenable to inspection. <em>Great Falls Tribune v.

Specifically, we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b425-4\">In effect, Article II, Sections 8 and 9, of the 1972 Montana Constitution impose an \u201caffirmative\u201d duty on government officials to make all of their records and proceedings available to public scrutiny. Consequently,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b425-5\">there is a <em>constitutional presumption </em>that all documents of every kind in the hands of public officials are amenable to inspection, regardless of legislation, special exceptions made to accommodate the exercise of constitutional police power, and other competing constitutional interests, such as due process.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b425-6\"><em>[Associated Press, Inc. v.

Leaving to the public the duty to initiate the challenge of confidentiality of particular documents filed by [the Montana Power Company (\u201cMPC\u201d)] with the [Montana Public Service Commission (\u201cPSC\u201d)] under a \u201cgeneric\u201d protective order abrogates the PSC\u2019s affirmative duty to make all of its records available to the public in the absence of <em>specific findings by the PSC </em>that the documents represented by MPC to constitute trade secrets or confidential proprietary information are indeed property interests which require constitutional due process protections.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b426-4\">Consequently, to the extent the PSC\u2019s current procedural rules and/or common practices rely on mere representations of public utilities that the information contains trade secrets or other confidential proprietary information which warrants protection of a PSC order and/or application of other protective measures, the PSC has unconstitutionally shifted the initial burden of proof to the public to challenge a public utility\u2019s claims of confidentiality. Thus, this creates a presumption of confidentiality which directly conflicts with the constitutional presumption of the public\u2019s right to view all public records and of the PSC\u2019s correlating constitutional affirmative duty to make its records and proceedings readily available to the public in the first instance.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AdhE\"><em>Great Falls Tribune, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 54-55.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-5\">\u00b639 Moreover, taking both the right to participate and the right to know together, we have stated as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b426-6\">\u201cBoth [Section 8 and Section 9 of Article II] arise out of the increasing concern of citizens and commentators alike that government\u2019s sheer bigness threatens the effective exercise of citizenship.

Yellowstone County School District, </em>2002 MT 264, \u00b6 31, 312 Mont. 257, \u00b6 31, 60 P.3d 381, \u00b6 31 (quoting Montana Constitutional Convention, Vol. II, Bill of Rights Committee Proposal, February 23, 1972, p. 631). Thus, in adopting Article II, Sections 8 and 9, the framers of Montana\u2019s Constitution envisioned a transparent government-one in which the public was guaranteed coordinate rights to examine public documents and deliberations of public bodies at all levels of government and to participate in the operations and final decision-making of the government\u2019s agencies.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>\u00b640 Indeed, while the right to know may not, in all circumstances, be \u201cabsolute,\u201d there is little doubt that, in cases where it is properly invoked, it is a right that is, at a minimum, equal to, and in most cases superior to, the right of individual privacy. In one respect, the right to know and the right of individual privacy are both on equal footing-they are both fundamental rights contained in Article II. However, in the context of right-to-know cases where the right of privacy is an issue, the right to know is most certainly superior. Article II, Section 9, states that no person shall be deprived of the right to examine documents <em>\u201cexcept </em>in cases in which the demand of individual privacy <em>clearly exceeds </em>the merits of public disclosure\u201d (emphasis added).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b427-3\">This plain and unambiguous language means that when the balance is even, the right to know trumps, thus requiring disclosure. In fact, even if the balance is slightly in favor of individual privacy, the right to know still trumps, thus requiring disclosure. It is <em>only </em>when the balance is <em>clearly </em>in favor of individual privacy that the documents may be properly withheld from the public. It is at this stage, and this stage only, that the right to individual privacy trumps the right to know.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b427-4\"><em>Havre Daily News, LLC, v. City of Havre, </em>2006 MT 215, \u00b6 69, 333 Mont. 331, \u00b6 69, 142 P.3d 864, \u00b6 69 (Nelson, J., concurring and dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b427-5\">\u00b641 The plain language of the Constitution requires that disclosure is the rule, and withholding public documents and information based on individual privacy is the exception. The term \u201cexcept\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> in Section 9 necessarily makes withholding information based on privacy the exception under elemental rules of statutory interpretation. Thus, the right to know is indeed superior in the sense that it <em>presumptively trumps </em>the right to individual privacy in these contexts.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-6\">\u00b642 And, if this plain language is not clear enough, the transcripts of the Constitutional Convention make it unquestionable. As the venerable Delegate Dorothy Eck stated, with regard to Section 9, \u201cwe added the word \u2018clearly\u2019 with the intention of <em>tipping the balance </em>in the favor of the right to know.\u201d Montana Constitutional Convention, Verbatim Transcript, March 7, 1972, p. 1670 (emphasis added). How much more clear can it be? The balance is <em>tipped in favor </em>of the right <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>to know-that, indeed, makes this right presumptively superior to the right of individual privacy in right-to-know cases where the two rights are in tension.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-4\">\u00b643 In this regard the framers of Montana\u2019s Article II, Section 9, were uncannily foresighted. In December 2005, the <em>New York Times </em>reported that the National Security Agency (\u201cNSA\u201d) had been conducting a covert, warrantless program of monitoring international telephone calls and e-mails of thousands of persons suspected of links with terrorist organizations.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Then, in May 2006, another national newspaper, <em>USA Today, </em>broke the story that the NSA had been secretly collecting the phone call records of tens of millions of Americans using data provided by phone companies-these not limited to international calls, but including domestic calls made by ordinary Americans.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> This sort of \u201cdata mining\u201d has also been conducted on confidential financial information.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> One federal court has ruled that some of these activities have been conducted in violation of the federal constitution.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Aside from these observations, it is not my purpose here to comment on these matters further, other than to point out the following.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-5\">\u00b644 The protection of our constitutional rights is in many cases dependent upon a vigorous and free press and an independent judiciary passionately committed to the rule of law and to the supremacy of the Constitution. The right of individual privacy is a case in point. As demonstrated by the foregoing references to the federal government\u2019s secretive and warrantless data mining of personal information, the integrity and vitality of the right of privacy may well depend solely upon the individual\u2019s ability to learn that his or her right has been violated. Indeed, in Montana, protection of the right of individual privacy may well rise and fall on the ability of the press to demand and then disclose public documents under Article II, Section <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>9; on the right of individuals to examine documents and observe the deliberations of public bodies or agencies at all levels of government under Article II, Section 9; and on an independent judiciary committed to supporting, protecting, and defending this constitutional scheme.</p>\n<p id=\"AWb\">\u00b645 It was prescient of the framers of Montana\u2019s Constitution to recognize that the right of individual privacy may well depend upon the right to know. And it was their farsightedness which requires that the scales-holding on one side privacy and on the other disclosure-be tipped in favor of the right to know, <em>except </em>where the demand for individual privacy <em>clearly exceeds </em>the merits of public disclosure. In cases brought under Article II, Section 9, the right to know is superior and disclosure is presumed.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-3\">\u00b646 From this presumption, it follows that public officers and bureaucrats do not own proprietary interests in public documents and information; they do not have the right to censor public documents and information; they do not have the right to close off the government\u2019s deliberations from public scrutiny no matter how well-meaning or solicitous their intentions-with one, and only one, explicit constitutional <em>exception: </em>cases in which the demand of individual privacy <em>clearly exceeds </em>the merits of public disclosure.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-4\">\u00b647 Yet that is what is happening in Montana in too many instances. As the freedom of information audit conducted in the summer of2003 by various news organizations<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> demonstrated, requests of officials for specific public documents were met, on average, only 81 percent of the time. And in only 19 of 56 counties were all of the requested documents supplied. While some local government officials, when asked for public information, were willing, polite, and cheerful, others were rude, hostile, defensive, antagonistic, and parochial and demanded information regarding the identity of the requestor. In one case, the public official censored public information that \u201cthe public [didn\u2019t] need to know about.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b429-5\">\u00b648 Discussing this survey, Montana School of Law Professor Fritz Snyder recounts:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b429-6\">In 2003, a survey in Montana showed an 81 percent success rate in obtaining public information from public agencies. However, nearly half of Montana\u2019s county sheriffs violated the state\u2019s Open Records Law by refusing to release their jail rosters. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>The sheriffs or their employees claimed the inmate lists were confidential. The Daniels County sheriff said he did not care what the law said: \u201cHe wasn\u2019t about to let anyone see his list of recent crime calls without a court order.\u201d \u201cA District Court clerk in Chinook took it upon herself to censor the roster of court cases by removing ones \u2018the public doesn\u2019t need to know about.\u2019 \u201d In six counties, officials said it would take a court order to get the information. \u201cIn all, just 11 counties provided the reports at the first request from the citizens making the checks.\u201d Judith Basin County Sheriff Robert Jacobi said that his office \u201chas a responsibility not to disclose the misfortunes of people in the community to anyone who walks in off the street.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b430-4\">Fritz Snyder, <em>The Right to Participate and the Right to Know in Montana, </em>66 Mont. L. Rev. 297, 317-18 (Summer 2005). (Among the items requested was a copy of each sheriffs report of the incident calls handled in the previous twenty-four hours.)<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b430-5\">\u00b649 The Montana Constitution has been the supreme law of this State for more than thirty years. It is wholly unacceptable that the media and public are still met with intransigence, stalling tactics, and delay, and are ultimately forced to litigate to obtain public documents to which they are constitutionally-and presumptively-entitled. We see far too many of these cases each year; and there are more waiting in the wings as we hand down this Opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-6\">\u00b650 While awarding attorney fees is, as noted, discretionary, the sorts of abuses at issue in this case will continue <em>ad infinitum </em>unless the custodians of public documents appreciate that violations of the right-to-know provisions of the Constitution will, in the usual course, result in an award of attorney fees in favor of the requestor and against the local government. Adopting the above factors will guide the trial courts in that direction, and, therefore, I would adopt the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-7\">\u00b651 That said, the practicing bar must understand that this Court will avoid addressing these factors unless some litigant makes it an issue in the trial court. Therefore, I urge the media, or whichever citizen is next deprived of his or her fundamental right to know, to make these factors an issue in any demand for attorney fees and to raise the lower court\u2019s denial of the use of these factors in the opening brief on appeal. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>Presumably, since this matter is being remanded for reconsideration of the attorney fees question-a decision that, itself, will be appealable-the Gazette will do precisely that.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-4\">\u00b652 With that addition, I concur in our Opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b425-7\"> Article II, Section 9, provides: \u201cRight to Know.

I also join the Court in concluding the District Court abused its discretion by failing to state a rationale for denying the Gazette\u2019s motion for attorney fees and its remand for that purpose. Our precedent compels this result.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-10\">\u00b655 I respectfully dissent from much of the Court\u2019s discussion of issue two relating to attorney fees. In addition, I feel compelled to comment on the concurring Justice\u2019s views.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-11\">\u00b656 To begin near the end of the Court\u2019s opinion, the Court makes an actual holding that discretion to deny attorney fees in right to know cases is \u201cnot unfettered.\u201d A \u201cholding\u201d is a \u201ccourt\u2019s determination of a matter of law pivotal to its decision[.]\u201d <em>See </em>749 BLACK\u2019S Law DICTIONARY (8th ed. 2004). Here, no party suggests-and nor would a party to any other case in Montana suggest-that judicial discretion is unfettered. In my view, the law is abundantly clear that discretion is not unfettered. Thus, the Court\u2019s \u201cholding\u201d to that effect is not a determination of a matter of law, much less a matter of law \u201cpivotal\u201d to its decision on attorney fees in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-12\">\u00b657 We all agree that the language of \u00a7 2-3-221, MCA, vests discretion in a district court. Moreover, our longstanding and ineluctable rule is that a trial court abuses its discretion when it \u201cacts arbitrarily without conscientious judgment or exceeds the bounds of reason resulting in substantial injustice.\u201d <em>Campbell v. Canty, </em>1998 MT 278, \u00b6 35, 291 Mont. 398, \u00b6 35, 969 P.2d 268, \u00b6 35; see <em>also, Shilhanek v. D-2 Trucking, Inc., </em>2000 MT 16, \u00b6 24, 298 Mont. 101, \u00b6 24, 994 P.2d 1105, \u00b6 24; <em>Matter of Investigative Records, </em>272 Mont. at 488, 901 P.2d at 567. Stated simply, this means that an exercise of judicial discretion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>requires non-arbitrary, conscientious judgment. It clearly does not mean-and has never meant-that discretion is unfettered.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-4\">\u00b658 Furthermore, it is not easy-and is not intended to be easy-for a party to establish an abuse of discretion on appeal. However, it can be done-and is not uncommonly done-by appellants in this Court. <em>See, e.g., State v. Golie, </em>2006 MT 91, \u00b6 30, 332 Mont. 69, \u00b6 30, 134 P.3d 95, \u00b6 30; <em>Somont Oil Co. v. A &amp; G Drilling, Inc., </em>2006 MT 90, \u00b6\u00b6 23, 28, 332 Mont. 56, \u00b6\u00b6 23, 28, 137 P.3d 536, \u00b6\u00b6 23, 28. As stated above, no \u201cholding\u201d that discretion is not unfettered is necessary here, or in any other case. Holdings by this Court should continue to be used only for pivotal determinations of legal matters.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-5\">\u00b659 Moreover, I do not understand the Court\u2019s reasons for even mentioning <em>Associated Press, Inc. </em>in discussing attorney fees in the present case. From our numerous cases on the attorney fee issue in right to know versus right to privacy cases, it appears to me the Court references one that is substantially dissimilar. It is true that in <em>Associated Press, Inc., </em>we held that the costs of litigation in cases where public benefits were gained should be spread among beneficiaries. We so held, however, in the context of an action by AP successfully challenging a Department of Revenue regulation we held was facially unconstitutional, and the very promulgation of which was egregious conduct by a state agency. I agreed with our decision on attorney fees there and continue to support it.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-6\">\u00b660 The case now before us bears little resemblance to <em>Associated Press, Inc. </em>Here, the County-not the Gazette-began the underlying action. Recognizing its obligations pursuant to the constitutional right to know as well as its employees\u2019 asserted constitutional rights to privacy, it is my view the County did the best it could: it filed for a District Court declaration regarding the competing constitutional rights within two weeks of the Gazette\u2019s initial request (which, importantly, did not yet include a request for the Bevolden deposition which later became-and still is on appeal-a primary focal point of the Gazette\u2019s interest). In doing so, the County asked a court to balance the competing constitutional rights as discussed in the Court\u2019s opinion on issue one.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-7\">\u00b661 What were the County\u2019s other options? It could have simply ignored privacy rights and provided the information to the Gazette. Surely this Court does not want to encourage a government entity to do so. In any event, the potential result of that choice by the County would be litigation asserting a violation of its employees\u2019 privacy rights. Alternatively, the County could have told the Gazette \u201cthe heck <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>with the right to know.\u201d Surely we do not want to encourage that conduct either, with the relatively certain result of litigation <em>by </em>the Gazette asserting a violation of the constitutional right to know, which properly would be more susceptible to an award of attorney fees pursuant to <em>Associated </em>Press, <em>Inc. </em>It is my view that the County took the only reasonable approach by presenting the matter to a judge whose job it is to resolve such sensitive constitutional balancing issues.</p>\n<p id=\"A51Q\">\u00b662 At the bottom line, I note that we-and others-often cite to the discretion vested in a trial court pursuant to \u00a7 2-3-221, MCA. We often overlook, however, the remainder of that statute which states without equivocation that \u201c[a] plaintiff who prevails in an action brought in district court to enforce his rights under Article II, section 9, of the Montana constitution may be awarded his costs and reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees.\u201d Here, the Gazette was not a plaintiff trying to enforce rights under Article II, section 9; the County was the plaintiff in the District Court. Consequently, it is my view that-ultimately-the Gazette cannot be awarded attorney fees in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-3\">\u00b663 With regard to the concurring Justice\u2019s opinion, I fully understand the decision to put the Gazette\u2019s late-offered \u201cguidelines\u201d out in plain view. We often include matters not timely or properly raised in a case before us in concurring opinions to \u201cget them out there\u201d as food for thought or for legal argument in future cases. Moreover, while some might question the propriety of giving advice to the Gazette\u2019s lawyer (who, it safely can be said, does not need it!) about a position to take on remand, these are matters wholly within the judgment, conscience and discretion of each of us. For myself, I have no quarrel with the idea that district courts may-in an appropriate case-consider such factors, together with any other factors offered by parties or deemed appropriate by the court in cases such as these. I would not, however, support an effort to mandate consideration by district courts of these or any other factors in the exercise of their discretion under \u00a7 2-3-221, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-4\">\u00b664 Furthermore, I observe that the lengthy discussion of Article II, Sections 8 and 9, of the Montana Constitution and other matters-in \u00b6\u00b6 36-48 of the concurring opinion-springs entirely from the concurring Justice\u2019s view that \u201ca presumption of awarding attorney fees to the prevailing plaintiff\u2019 should exist in cases of this type. It is important to note that the Gazette does not raise this theory. In addition, at least in my view, the discussion in support of the \u201cpresumption\u201d appears to place the concurring Justice somewhat at odds with the Court\u2019s-and my-continued support of the critical balancing test in right to know <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>and right to privacy cases, as discussed by the Court in issue one. Finally, the presumption-even as expressed by the concurring Justice-would apply to a \u201cprevailing plaintiff.\u201d In any event, however, this latter portion of the concurring Justice\u2019s theory is consistent with the language of \u00a7 2-3-221, MCA, as discussed above, and would bar an award of attorney fees to the Gazette in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-4\">\u00b665 In sum, I concur in the Court\u2019s opinion on issue one. I dissent from much of the Court\u2019s rationale in discussing issue two and would simply, without fanfare, remand to the District Court for the entry of an order stating the reasons it denied the Gazette\u2019s motion for attorney fees pursuant to \u00a7 2-3-221, MCA. I dissent from the Court\u2019s failure to do so.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
