We reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-9\">\u00b62 Anna presents the following issue on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b542-10\">\u00b63 Whether the District Court abused its discretion by awarding to Glen the entire amount of his pension.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-11\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b542-12\">\u00b64 Anna and Glen met in California in 1988. They moved together to Missoula, Montana, in January of 1989. Glen began accruing a pension through his employer, JTL Group (formerly Western Materials), in March of 1990. Anna and Glen had a child, Billie, on April 1, 1990. Glen continued to work at JTL Group, and Anna remained at home to care for Billie and maintain the household. Anna and Glen married on June 1, 1993. Anna began working at JB\u2019s restaurant after Billie started school and continued working there until after she and Glen separated in December of 1998. Glen earned approximately three times Anna\u2019s annual income.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-13\">\u00b65 Glen filed a petition for dissolution of marriage in May of 2001. The Standing Master, Brenda Desmond, issued her recommended findings of fact, conclusions of law, and decree of dissolution of marriage on February 12,2004. The Standing Master found that Anna and Glen agreed that Anna was entitled to half of Glen\u2019s accrued retirement pension from JTL Group, but disputed over what period of time her entitlement accrued. The Standing Master further found that the value of Glen\u2019s pension as of October 31,2002, was $55,478.30. The only other marital asset was a life insurance policy with a cash value of $5,500.00. Anna and Glen also had accrued credit card debts totaling approximately $5,400.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-14\">\u00b66 The Standing Master\u2019s proposed decree recommended that the District Court award Anna half of Glen\u2019s accrued pension from the date of its inception in 1990 to the date Glen filed for dissolution in 2001. The Standing Master further recommended that the District Court award half of the life insurance policy to Anna. The Standing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>Master finally recommended that Glen be responsible for the couple\u2019s debts, as Glen was mainly responsible for accruing those debts. Glen contested the Standing Master\u2019s proposed distribution and the case proceeded to district court. Glen did not object to the Standing Master\u2019s recommendation that Anna receive half of his pension. He did object, however, to the time frame that the Standing Master proposed.</p>\n<p id=\"AbB\">\u00b67 The District Court issued its findings of fact, conclusions of law, and decree of dissolution of marriage on July 6, 2004. The District Court disregarded the Standing Master\u2019s recommendations, including Anna\u2019s and Glen's agreement that she was entitled to half of the pension accrued over a disputed period of time, and instead awarded Glen the entire amount of his pension. The District Court required Glen to pay half of the cash value of the life insurance policy to Anna. The court further required that Glen be responsible for the couple\u2019s accrued credit card debts. The District Court\u2019s decree thus awarded 95% of the marital estate to Glen, and 5% to Anna.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-4\">\u00b68 Glen did not file a notice of entry of judgment until March 31, 2005. Anna filed a motion to amend the decree on April 8, 2005. The District Court denied the motion on June 8, 2005. Glen filed a notice of entry of judgment in response to the District Court\u2019s order on June 13, 2005. Anna timely filed a notice of appeal on July 11, 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-5\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b543-6\">\u00b69 We review a district court\u2019s division of marital property to determine whether its findings of facts are clearly erroneous. <em>Collins v. Collins, </em>2004 MT 365, \u00b6 16, 324 Mont. 500, \u00b6 16, 104 P.3d 1059, \u00b6 16. We will affirm a district court\u2019s distribution of property unless it abused its discretion if its findings are not clearly erroneous. <em>Collins, </em>\u00b6 16. A district court abuses its discretion in dividing marital property when it acts arbitrarily without employment of conscientious judgment or exceeds the bounds of reason resulting in substantial injustice. <em>Collins, </em>\u00b6 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b543-8\">\u00b610 Anna argues that the District Court abused its discretion by awarding the entire amount of Glen\u2019s pension to Glen. She asserts that the District Court\u2019s award of 95% of the marital estate to Glen represents a substantial injustice. In this regard, Anna points out that Glen conceded in front of the Standing Master that Anna was entitled to half of the pension. He disputed only the time period during which that half should be calculated. Anna next asserts that the District <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>Court abused its discretion by failing to consider the factors set forth in \u00a7 40-4-202, MCA. Specifically, Anna argues that the District Court failed to consider adequately her contributions as a homemaker and caregiver to Billie, the large disparity in income between Glen and her, and their respective abilities to acquire future assets. Anna further contends that the District Court\u2019s decree regarding the pension conflicts with its own findings of facts and conclusions of law. She finally argues that the District Court abused its discretion by modifying a portion of the Standing Master\u2019s proposed order despite Glen\u2019s failure to object specifically to that portion.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-4\">\u00b611 Glen counters that Anna timely failed to raise two of these arguments to the District Court-that the District Court\u2019s award of 95% of the marital estate to Glen represents a substantial injustice and that the District Court abused its discretion amending a finding of the Special Master to which Glen failed to raise a specific objection-and is thus barred from raising them on appeal. He seeks to restrict the scope of Anna\u2019s appeal to those issues raised in her motion to amend the decree dated June 8,2005. Glen does not provide any authority for this argument. Glen further asserts that the District Court did not abuse its discretion in awarding Glen the entire amount of his pension.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-5\">\u00b612 Rule 23(b), M. R. App. P., imposes the same briefing requirements on a respondent as on an appellant through its incorporation of subsections (a)(1) through (4). Thus, a respondent, similar to an appellant, must present a concise, cohesive argument, with citations to authorities that support the argument. <em>See </em>M. R. App. P. 23(a)(4),(b). Glen\u2019s timeliness argument contains no citations to any supporting authority. We repeatedly have held that we will not consider unsupported issues or arguments. <em>In re Marriage of McMahon, </em>2002 MT 198, \u00b6 6, 311 Mont. 175, \u00b6 6, 53 P.3d 1266, \u00b6 6. Moreover, we are under no obligation to locate authorities or develop arguments for a party in support of a position taken on appeal. <em>Marriage of McMahon, </em>\u00b6 6. We therefore decline to address Glen\u2019s unsupported and undeveloped timeliness argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-6\">\u00b613 Section 3-5-124, MCA, allows for district courts to refer petitions for dissolution to a standing master. The court may direct the standing master to issue findings of fact and conclusions of law. Section 3-5-124(2)(a), MCA. Parties have ten days after being served with notice of the filing of the findings and conclusions to \u201cserve written <em>specific objections </em>upon the other parties.\u201d Section 3-5-126(2), MCA (emphasis added). This section further provides that \u201c[application to the court for action upon the findings and conclusions or order and upon the filing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>of <em>specific objections </em>to the findings and conclusions or order must be made by motion ....\u201d Section 3-5-126(2), MCA (emphasis added). District cotuts may then \u201cadopt the findings and conclusions or order and may modify, reject in whole or in part, receive further evidence, or recommit the findings and conclusions or order with instructions\u201d after a hearing. Section 3-5-126(2), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-4\">\u00b614 We read statutes in their entirety when construing legislative intent. <em>State v. Mathis, </em>2003 MT 112, \u00b6 27, 315 Mont. 378, \u00b6 27, 68 P.3d 756, \u00b6 27. We will not determine the legislative intent based upon the wording of any particular section or sentence, but only from a consideration of the statute as a whole. <em>Mathis, </em>\u00b6 27. We interpret a statute to give effect to its purpose and to avoid absurd results. <em>Mathis, </em>\u00b6 27.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-5\">\u00b615  A reading of \u00a7 3-5-126(2), MCA, in its entirety demonstrates that a district court may modify a finding of fact or conclusion of law only to which a party has filed a \u201cspecific objection.\u201d The legislature twice referenced the requirement that parties file \u201cspecific objections\u201d to the findings or conclusions of a standing master. Section 3-5-126(2), MCA. District courts must hold a hearing before modifying, rejecting, or recommitting a standing master\u2019s findings and conclusions. Allowing courts to modify findings or conclusions not specifically objected to by either party would deny adequate notice and due process to the parties and lead to an absurd result. <em>See Mathis, </em>\u00b6 27.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-6\">\u00b616  Glen failed to object specifically to the Standing Master\u2019s finding that Anna should receive half of his pension. Glen obj ected only to the period of time over which her half of the pension accrued. The District Court\u2019s modification of the Standing Master\u2019s finding that Anna should receive half of Glen\u2019s pension therefore represents an abuse of discretion. <em>See </em>\u00a7 3-5-126(2), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-7\">\u00b617 We reverse and remand for the District Court to determine over what period of time Anna\u2019s half of Glen\u2019s pension accrued and to make a division accordingly.</p>\n<judges id=\"b545-8\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES COTTER, WARNER and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
