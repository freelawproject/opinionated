After Browning provided proof of insurance, the State dropped the last charge. A year and three attorneys later, Browning appeared <em>pro se </em>before the Twentieth Judicial District Court, Lake County, and pled guilty. Because the DUI was Browning\u2019s sixth DUI offense and he had prior convictions for bail jumping, the court sentenced Browning as a persistent felony offender to twenty years, with the entire sentence suspended except for time served through completion of the WATCH program. Browning subsequently filed a motion to withdraw his guilty plea, contending that his plea was involuntary because he did not receive effective assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"AVB\">\u00b62 The issue on appeal is whether the District Court denied Browning assistance of counsel and therefore erred when it denied Browning\u2019s motion to withdraw his guilty plea?</p>\n<p id=\"b157-10\">\u00b63 We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-11\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b157-12\">\u00b64 The District Court assigned three attorneys to represent Browning during the year-plus that Browning\u2019s case moved through <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>the lower court, none of whom ultimately represented Browning when he pled guilty. The first lawyer, Larry Nistler, withdrew from the case, citing deterioration of the attorney-client relationship to the point where new counsel would better serve Browning\u2019s best interests. The second attorney, Sean Hinchey, was removed after Browning expressed distrust for him, specifically because Hinchey \u201ctried to convince\u201d Browning\u2019s wife to talk Browning into accepting a plea agreement from the State. The court appointed a third lawyer, Lane Bennett, whom Browning dismissed minutes before a scheduled trial in anticipation of hiring private counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-4\">\u00b65 Throughout proceedings, Browning repeatedly expressed dismay and frustration with his court-appointed attorneys for not obtaining certain discovery. On the day the District Court dismissed Bennett as counsel, Browning stated that while he believed Bennett was a \u201cprofessional,\u201d there were \u201ccertain things\u201d in his case that he had requested and not received. The court told Browning that it believed the evidence Browning wanted did not exist and then explained in detail the consequences Browning faced in terminating his third court-appointed attorney. The court made clear that while Browning had every right to hire any attorney of his choosing, Bennett would be the last court-appointed defender on the case. Browning stated that he understood the potential ramifications of terminating Bennett, but that he nonetheless wanted to proceed without Bennett because he intended to hire a private attorney, Rebecca Dupuis, to represent him.</p>\n<p id=\"AV4\">\u00b66 The following discussion, in pertinent part, transpired between the court and Browning on the day that Browning\u2019s third attorney, Bennett, was terminated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b158-5\">THE COURT: ... The Court is significantly concerned about you proceeding without representation. However, you certainly have the right to either represent yourself or to hire private counsel.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b158-6\">... [I]f Ms. Dupuis intends to represent you, that\u2019s certainly your right. But she needs to be prepared to go to trial in 20 minutes. And I\u2019m wondering, based on your request, where she is, if you intend to proceed with Ms. Dupuis. If not, then the Court would expect that you intend to represent yourself.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b158-7\">And before I\u2019m going to remove Mr. Bennett off this case, I want to make very, very certain that you understand all of the dangers and disadvantages of representing yourself. Mr. Bennett has outlined some of those.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>So at this point is it your intention, then, to proceed with Ms. Dupuis, to represent yourself or to continue with Mr. Bennett as your attorney?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-4\">BROWNING: Well, I want Ms. Dupuis.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-5\">THE COURT: Well, she\u2019s not here. And you have a trial in 15 minutes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-6\">The only way I\u2019m going to grant you a continuance to allow Ms. Dupuis to appear for you is if you waive speedy trial, sir. You have a trial date right now at nine o\u2019clock, in 15 minutes, and I have 40 jurors sitting out there.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-7\">... Mr. Browning, you have two options, sir, at this point in time. The only way that you can proceed with Ms. Dupuis as your attorney is to waive your right to speedy trial, obtain a continuance and allow her to be present. The county attorney has just attempted again to call her. It\u2019s now 12 minutes to nine o\u2019clock, which is the time set for trial, and there\u2019s no answer at her office.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-8\">BROWNING: I want the continuance.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-9\">THE COURT: You want the continuance.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-10\">BROWNING: Yes, Your Honor. I\u2019m going to continue.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-11\">THE COURT: You want the continuance.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-12\">BROWNING: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-13\">THE COURT: And as I indicated, you want that continuance so that Ms. Dupuis can represent you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-14\">BROWNING: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-15\">THE COURT: All right. Mr. Bennett, you are removed as the public defender in this case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-16\">And you understand, [Mr. Browning], that I\u2019m presuming that Ms. Dupuis is actually going to appear on your behalf at this point intime.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-17\">BROWNING: So am I. I\u2019m presuming that she is also. We have the money coming to-</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-18\">THE COURT: Because the other thing is, you have to understand that essentially what you are doing is you will be in a position where you will be representing yourself. And that means that all of the same rules in court apply to you just as they do the lawyers.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>BROWNING: Yeah.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-4\">THE COURT: You understand that if you make any mistakes, that I can\u2019t give you any assistance and I won\u2019t give you any special benefits or privileges.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-5\">BROWNING: I understand.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-6\">THE COURT: You understand that the government is represented by an attorney, someone who has spent a lot of time in handling criminal cases. And you understand that you will be up against determining all of the decisions that would have to be made in selection of a jury, in providing an opening statement, in what\u2019s admissible evidence. You understand that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-7\">BROWNING: I understand.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-8\">THE COURT: You understand that you would then have to conduct your own direct and your own cross-examination of witnesses.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-9\">BROWNING: I understand.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-10\">THE COURT: In addition... you understand that by removing Mr. Bennett, then the Court is removing the obligation to have a public defender involved in this case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-11\">BROWNING: I understand.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-12\">THE COURT: All right. Then I have removed Mr. Bennett. You are now for the Court\u2019s purposes representing yourself until and unless such time happens as Ms. Dupuis enters some appearance ....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-13\">BROWNING: I want to thank Mr. Bennett. I just - he did seem to be pretty professional. There\u2019s just certain things that would have eased my mind and made me feel better about my case if I would have gotten them sooner. I just -</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-14\">THE COURT: The Court\u2019s difficulty is, at this point you\u2019re in three attorneys deep. ... The first one the Court removed. Mr. Hinchey and Mr. Bennett the Court did not remove until request to do so by you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-15\">BROWNING: Mr. Hinchey lied to me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-16\">THE COURT: My experience with both counsel is they\u2019re very professional and very experienced, and I am concerned about you representing yourself in this matter because of the dangers and disadvantages that come with that. But you have that right and I am going to afford that to you.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b160-17\">\u00b67 Although Browning intended to retain Dupuis as counsel, his plans failed when his daughter allegedly absconded with the retainer fee. Browning then told the court that he wanted to hire his own <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>attorney, but that he lacked sufficient funds. Browning further stated that he was \u201cin no shape to act as [his] own attorney.\u201d The court responded that it had been clear with Browning that when Bennett was dismissed, Browning was either proceeding with private counsel or appearing <em>pro se </em>and that under the circumstances, the court viewed Browning as representing himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-4\">\u00b68 During subsequent hearings, Browning asserted that in representing himself, he was receiving ineffective assistance of counsel because he was \u201ca fool\u201d as an attorney. The court informed Browning in no uncertain terms that it would not assign another defender to represent Browning because it had already appointed three qualified lawyers, none of whom satisfied Browning, and that Browning had \u201cfired\u201d the last attorney when the court had a jury sitting for trial. \u201cI can\u2019t do any better than that,\u201d the court told Browning, \u201cand I\u2019m not going to.\u201d Browning explained to the court that in continuing <em>pro se, </em>he would \u201cbe prejudiced because I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m doing.\u201d When asked by the court what the likelihood was that any attorney would satisfy him, Browning responded that all he had wanted was an attorney that would obtain certain State dispatch logs relating to his arrest. At this point, the court, in part because of Browning\u2019s status as a <em>pro se </em>litigant, ordered the State to provide the discovery that Browning requested. The court then reiterated to Browning that it would not appoint further counsel because it could not provide Browning an attorney to his satisfaction. The court noted, \u201cI\u2019m hopeful that you can provide for yourself.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b161-5\">\u00b69 Browning eventually pled guilty pursuant to a plea agreement that was significantly more onerous than a previous offer from the State. During the change of plea hearing, Browning asserted that while he did not want to sign the plea agreement, he felt there was no other choice, as he was \u201cstuck,\u201d unable to pay for an attorney. Browning further stated that in complaining of his representation, he \u201cnever intended to mess with the Court,\u201d he simply wanted evidence that his lawyers had failed to obtain. The court accepted Browning\u2019s guilty plea and sentenced him accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-6\">\u00b610 Post-sentencing, the District Court appointed the Appellate Defender Office to review Browning\u2019s case. The office, in conjunction with the University of Montana Criminal Defense Clinic, filed a motion to withdraw Browning\u2019s guilty plea, arguing that Browning\u2019s plea was not a voluntary and intelligent choice, but rather, a helpless decision resulting from lack of counsel. The District Court denied Browning\u2019s motion, stating that it had \u201cmade every effort to afford the Defendant counsel,\u201d but that no attorney could represent Browning \u201cin the way <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>that he wished.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b162-4\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b162-5\">\u00b611 When a defendant appeals a district court\u2019s denial of a motion to withdraw a guilty plea, we review the trial court\u2019s findings of fact to determine if they are clearly erroneous, and conclusions of law to determine if they are correct. When the voluntariness of the plea is at issue, we review that ultimate mixed question of law and fact <em>de novo </em>to determine if the trial court correctly held that the defendant pled voluntarily. <em>State v. Leitheiser, </em>2006 MT 70, \u00b6 12, 331 Mont. 464, \u00b6 12, 133 P.3d 185, \u00b6 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b162-7\">\u00b612 Did the District Court deny Browning assistance of counsel and therefore err when it denied Browning\u2019s motion to withdraw his guilty plea?</p>\n<p id=\"b162-8\">\u00b613 Browning argues that the District Court should have granted the motion to withdraw his guilty plea pursuant to \u00a7 46-16-105(2), MCA, which allows a defendant to withdraw a guilty plea for \u201cgood cause shown.\u201d Browning argues that he has shown good cause because his plea was entered without the assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-9\">\u00b614  \u201cThe right to assistance of counsel is embodied in the Sixth Amendment of the United States Constitution and Article II, Section 24 of the Montana Constitution.\u201d <em>State v. Langford </em>(1994), 267 Mont. 95, 99, 882 P.2d 490, 492. \u201cIndigent defendants are entitled to legal representation by court-appointed counsel at public expense.\u201d <em>State v. Mann, </em>2006 MT 33, \u00b6 12, 331 Mont. 137, \u00b6 12, 130 P.3d 164, \u00b6 12. Although an accused has a constitutional right to appear <em>pro se, </em>such action results in the loss of many benefits associated with the right to counsel. Consequently, this Court indulges in every reasonable presumption against waiver of the right to counsel. <em>State v. Swan, </em>2000 MT 246, \u00b6\u00b6 16-17, 301 Mont. 439, \u00b6\u00b6 16-17, 10 P.3d 102, \u00b6\u00b6 16-17.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-10\">\u00b615  \u201cSince <em>Gideon v. Wainwright </em>(1963), 372 U.S. 335, 83 S.Ct. 792, 9 L.Ed.2d 799, it has been clear that a guilty plea to a felony charge entered without counsel and without a waiver of counsel is invalid.\u201d <em>Brady v. U.S. </em>(1970), 397 U.S. 742, n.6, 90 S.Ct. 1463, n.6, 25 L.Ed.2d 747, n.6. This Court will uphold a waiver of counsel so long as the defendant made the decision knowingly, voluntarily and intelligently. Section 46-8-102, MCA. In <em>Langford, </em>267 Mont. at 99, 882 P.2d at 492 (citing <em>United States v. Robinson </em>(9th Cir. 1990), 913 F.2d 712, 714), we adopted the Ninth Circuit\u2019s requirement that \u201cthe <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>request to represent oneself must [also] be unequivocal.\u201d This requirement serves an institutional purpose in that a defendant who vacillates at trial between wishing to be represented by counsel and wishing to represent himself could place the trial court in a difficult position:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b163-4\">If the court appoints counsel, the defendant could, on appeal, rely on his intermittent requests for self-representation in arguing that he had been denied the right to represent himself; if the court permits self-representation the defendant could claim he had been denied the right to counsel. The requirement of unequivocality resolves this dilemma by forcing the defendant to make an explicit choice. If he equivocates, he is presumed to have requested the assistance of counsel.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b163-5\"><em>Langford, </em>267 Mont. at 100, 882 P.2d at 493 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b163-6\">\u00b616 In <em>Langford, </em>the defendant argued that he had been denied the right to represent himself when the court refused to remove court-appointed counsel after he stated during a pre-trial hearing that he waived his right to counsel. \u201cStanding alone,\u201d we noted, \u201cLangford\u2019s request appears to be unequivocal.\u201d Upon reviewing the record as a whole, however, we determined that \u201cthe request was equivocal\u201d given that Langford filed a motion both requesting replacement counsel and stating that he did not feel that he could \u201cremotely represent himself.\u201d <em>Langford, </em>267 Mont. at 101, 882 P.2d at 493. \u201cTaken as a whole,\u201d we concluded, \u201cthe record clearly reflects the fact that Langford\u2019s request to represent himself was equivocal\u201d and therefore the trial court did not violate Langford\u2019s right to self-representation. <em>Langford, </em>267 Mont, at 102, 882 P.2d at 494.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-7\">\u00b617 We reached a similar conclusion in <em>Swan, </em>where the defendant stated, \u201cYes, I do,\u201d when asked by the court if he wanted to proceed <em>pro se, </em>but then filed a motion suggesting that the court assign a new attorney as co-counsel to assist him with advice. <em>Swan, </em>\u00b6 20. We determined that what Swan really wanted was to have different counsel appointed and to be allowed to use the law library. <em>Swan, </em>\u00b6 20. Recognizing that Swan had changed his mind regarding representation by an attorney, we held that \u201c[t]he record as a whole reveals that Swan\u2019s request for self-representation was anything but \u25a0unequivocal.\u201d <em>Swan, </em>\u00b6 25.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-8\">\u00b618 Turning to the case at hand, the State argues that whether Browning asked to proceed <em>pro se </em>is \u201cirrelevant\u201d because the court advised Browning of the dangers and disadvantages of self-representation, and made clear that in dismissing Bennett, Browning was on his own if private counsel fell through. Relying on <em>State v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number><em>Craig, </em>(1995), 274 Mont. 140, 906 P.2d 683, the State contends that Browning cannot \u201chalt the administration of justice\u201d by insisting on a new attorney, while simultaneously refusing to waive his right to counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-4\">\u00b619 In <em>Craig, </em>we held that the District Court did not deny the defendant his constitutional right to the assistance of counsel when it denied his request for a substitution of court-appointed counsel. After conducting a hearing to determine whether counsel was ineffective, the court made the following statement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-5\">As with any other defendant, you are entitled to hire any attorney you wish.... You do have the right in [this] circumstance for a court-appointed counsel, but you do not have the right to choose your own attorney. So I\u2019m just telling you now that you also have the right to represent yourself for your trial date.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-6\">[Your court-appointed attorney] is going to stay on your case. I\u2019m going to deny your motion to replace him with any other public defender. It\u2019s too late, among other things. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s been any ineffectiveness on his part in preparing this case for trial. Nevertheless, he\u2019ll be here in court the morning of the trial, and if you don\u2019t want to use him, that\u2019s fine. You go ahead and represent yourself or bring another attorney.... [Your court-appointed attorney] is going to be here [at trial] as scheduled, and you\u2019re going to be here as scheduled. If you have a defense, we\u2019d like to hear it from you that day.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b164-7\"><em>Craig, </em>274 Mont. at 144-45, 906 P.2d at 686.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-8\">\u00b620 Apparently unable to afford private counsel, Craig proceeded to trial with his court-appointed attorney, all the while refusing to present a defense or cooperate with counsel. We reasoned that Craig could not, on appeal, assert denial of his right to counsel when he had refused to cooperate with his competent court-appointed attorney. <em>Craig, </em>274 Mont. at 152-53, 906 P.2d at 691.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-9\">\u00b621 Importantly, in <em>Craig, </em>we declined to adopt the State\u2019s position that Craig\u2019s rejection of court-appointed counsel constituted an unequivocal request to proceed <em>pro se </em>and a valid waiver of his right to counsel. <em>Craig, </em>274 Mont. at 151, 906 P.2d at 690. We determined that Craig did not seek permission to appear <em>pro se, </em>as he consistently and repeatedly reiterated that he was unqualified to represent himself. We thus concluded that the court appropriately retained Craig\u2019s court-appointed attorney given its determination that counsel was effective. <em>Craig, </em>274 Mont. at 152, 906 P.2d at 690.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-10\">\u00b622  In this case, when the District Court inquired whether Browning intended \u201cto proceed with Ms. Dupuis, to represent [himself] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>or to continue with Mr. Bennett as [his] attorney,\u201d Browning stated, \u201cI want Ms. Dupuis.\u201d While Browning affirmed that he understood that in terminating Bennett, he could be in a position of self-representation, he also indicated throughout the proceedings that he did not want to proceed <em>pro se </em>and was completely incompetent to serve as his own lawyer. The record does not support a conclusion that Browning unequivocally requested to proceed <em>pro se. </em>Under the <em>Langford </em>test, a defendant cannot be deemed <em>pro se </em>by default.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-4\">\u00b623  At first blush, it may appear that the district courts in <em>Craig </em>and Browning\u2019s case provided the defendants with a similar choice in that Browning, like Craig, was told he could proceed with court-appointed counsel or represent himself. The key difference, however-and the one this case turns on-is that the court in <em>Craig </em>declined to terminate Craig\u2019s public defender given that Craig had not made an unequivocal request to proceed <em>pro se, </em>whereas the court in Browning\u2019s case <em>did </em>terminate court-appointed counsel, even though there were no assurances that Browning had secured private representation and even though Browning had not made an unequivocal request to proceed <em>pro se. </em>Given these circumstances, we conclude that the District Court denied Browning the assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-5\">\u00b624  We hold that the District Court erred in denying Browning\u2019s motion to withdraw his guilty plea. Reversed and remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b165-6\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES COTTER and MORRIS concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b165-7\">JUSTICE RICE</author>\n<p id=\"AAi\">specially concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-8\">\u00b625 The Court creates an unnecessary and costly rule that accommodates defendants engaged in shenanigans with the judicial system.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-9\">\u00b626 In <em>Craig, </em>this Court stated the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-10\">In refusing to cooperate with his appointed counsel and, at the same time insisting that he was not asking to proceed <em>pro se, </em>Craig was attempting to force the appointment of new counsel. This Court cannot countenance such dilatory and manipulative tactics at the expense of the efficient administration of justice.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ahq\"><em>Craig, </em>274 Mont. at 153, 906 P.2d at 691. Faced with a defendant who was clearly attempting to unfairly manipulate the system to his advantage, the district court in <em>Craig </em>saw a viable remedy: keep appointed counsel on standby. While we recognized the prudence of that action by the district court, we did not make it a rule that in similar situations district courts <em>must </em>do likewise. We do so today.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>\u00b627 The tension in our precedent leads to the rule announced today, but it need not have done so. In <em>Craig, </em>we stated that \u201cat some point a criminal defendant can be deemed to have waived to a certain extent his constitutional right to effective assistance by virtue of his unreasonable refusal to communicate with his attorney,\u201d <em>Craig, </em>274 Mont. at 152, 906 P.2d at 690 (quoting <em>Thomas v. Wainwright </em>(11th Cir. 1985), 767 F.2d 738, 743), and that a \u201cpersistent unreasonable demand for dismissal of counsel [is] the functional equivalent of a knowing and voluntary waiver of counsel.\u201d <em>Craig, </em>274 Mont. at 152, 906 P.2d at 690 (quoting <em>Thomas, </em>767 F.2d at 743) (brackets in original). However, we also stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-4\">We decline to adopt the State\u2019s position that Craig\u2019s rejection of [appointed counsel\u2019s] representation constituted an unequivocal request to proceed <em>pro se </em>and a valid waiver of his right to counsel. Craig\u2019s situation does not meet the unequivocal request standard established by <em>Langford, </em>267 Mont. 95, 882 P.2d 490.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AUx\"><em>Craig, </em>274 Mont. at 151, 906 P.2d at 690. Thus, on the one hand, according to the rule in <em>Langford, </em>a defendant must make an unequivocal request to waive his right to counsel and to proceed <em>pro se. </em>On the other hand, according to <em>Craig, </em>a defendant\u2019s obfuscatory actions can at some point effectively create a waiver of the right to counsel-without an unequivocal request. In the latter situation, I would leave it to the district court\u2019s discretion in each individual case how best to address the defendant\u2019s actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-5\">\u00b628 I concur with the Court\u2019s decision today because I cannot say with confidence that Browning reached the point at which he could be deemed to have waived his right to counsel, because he was focused primarily on hiring private counsel. However, I do not agree that we should require, as a rule, appointed counsel to remain on standby absent an unequivocal waiver.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
