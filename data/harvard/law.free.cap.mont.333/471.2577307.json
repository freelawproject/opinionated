The Order required Mustang to restore an irrigation ditch on its property that provides water to Zaveta\u2019s property. We reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-8\">\u00b62 Mustang presents the following issues on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b496-9\">\u00b63 Did the District Court manifestly abuse its discretion when it granted Zaveta\u2019s motion for a preliminary injunction?</p>\n<p id=\"b496-10\">\u00b64 Did the District Court abuse its discretion when it awarded attorney's fees to Zaveta?</p>\n<p id=\"b496-11\">PROCEDURAL AND FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b496-12\">\u00b65 Mustang and Zaveta own neighboring land on U.S. Highway 12, just west of Lolo in Missoula County, Montana. Water from Lolo Creek has irrigated Zaveta\u2019s property for more than one hundred years via an irrigation ditch that crosses Mustang\u2019s property. The 1937 Lolo Creek Water Decree determined that Joseph Andrews, a predecessor-in-interest to Zaveta, originally appropriated the water rights associated with the ditch in 1884. Following the 1960 Water Resource Survey, the ditch was recognized as the Hendrickson-Kuney Ditch. The ditch ceases to be recognized as anything today, however, because Mustang bulldozed it late in 2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-13\">\u00b66 Zaveta held two claims for the water rights associated with the ditch with the Montana Department of Natural Resources and Conservation. The claims allowed Zaveta to begin irrigating annually in mid-March. Zaveta at some point failed to pay a $150.00 per claim processing fee as part of the statewide basin adjudication, however, and the Water Court terminated her claims in October 1999. Zaveta nonetheless continued to divert water through the ditch uninterrupted. Zaveta finally paid the claim processing fees in August 2003, however, and as a result the Water Court reopened Zaveta\u2019s case. The Water Court issued an order on November 4, 2003, reinstating Zaveta\u2019s claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-14\">\u00b67 Meanwhile, Mustang initiated the present action on July 31,2003, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>when it filed a complaint in District Court seeking a declaratory judgment that Zaveta had no right to use the ditch. Mustang based its complaint on the theory that the Water Court had terminated Zaveta\u2019s water rights permanently in October 1999, thereby extinguishing any easement in favor of Zaveta across its property as a matter of law in accord with \u00a7 70-17-111(3), MCA. Zaveta answered Mustang\u2019s complaint and asserted as an affirmative defense that she \u201cis the owner of an easement for a ditch located on [Mustang\u2019s] property.\u201d Zaveta\u2019s answer also prayed for \u201csuch other and further relief that the Court deems just and proper.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b497-4\">\u00b68 Mustang moved for summary judgment on December 4,2003. The District Court determined that genuine issues of material fact existed in light of the Water Court\u2019s order reinstating Zaveta\u2019s water rights, and denied the motion on August 20,2004. To date, the District Court has not issued a final order regarding Mustang\u2019s action for declaratory judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-5\">\u00b69 Mustang destroyed the very ditch at issue-without leave of the court-in November and December 2004. Zaveta in response moved for a preliminary injunction on March 16,2005. She alleged that Mustang violated \u00a7 70-17-112, MCA, which prohibits interference with a party\u2019s ditch easements, and that \u00a7 70-17-112(5), MCA, entitled her to attorney\u2019s fees. Zaveta also alleged that Mustang destroyed Zaveta\u2019s property \u201cwith intent to defraud Zaveta\u201d and that Mustang acted \u201cin violation of Zaveta\u2019s rights respecting the subject of the action and tending to render the judgment ineffectual.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b497-6\">\u00b610 The court held a hearing on May 10,2005, and issued an order on June 29, 2005. The order granted Zaveta\u2019s motion for a preliminary injunction and required Mustang to restore the ditch. The court further ordered Mustang to pay the costs and reasonable attorney\u2019s fees Zaveta incurred in connection with the preliminary injunction. Mustang appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-7\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b497-8\">\u00b611 We review the district court\u2019s decision to deny or grant a preliminary injunction for a manifest abuse of discretion. <em>Yockey v. Kearns </em>Properties, <em>LLC, </em>2005 MT 27, \u00b6 12, 326 Mont. 28, \u00b6 12, 106 P.3d 1185, \u00b6 12. A manifest abuse of discretion is one that is obvious, evident, or unmistakable. <em>Yockey, </em>\u00b6 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-9\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b497-10\">\u00b612 The core issue between the parties from the outset has been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>whether Zaveta still holds a valid easement through Mustang\u2019s property. If she does, then under \u00a7 70-17-112, MCA, it would be unlawful for Mustang to encroach upon or impair the ditch easement. The District Court denied Mustang\u2019s motion for summary judgment on this precise matter in December 2003, reserving it for trial. Mustang then destroyed the ditch late in 2004 before the District Court could determine the parties\u2019 respective rights pursuant to the complaint for declaratory relief filed by Mustang. This action prompted Zaveta\u2019s request in March 2005, for the issuance of a preliminary injunction, the granting of which gives rise to this appeal. It bears repeating that the questions of whether Zaveta holds a valid easement, and if so, the extent of the relief to which she is entitled, remain for trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-4\">\u00b613 Mustang asserts that the District Court manifestly abused its discretion when it granted a preliminary injunction absent \u201cany basis in law or fact.\u201d Section 27-19-201, MCA, establishes five situations in which a court may grant a preliminary injunction. The subsections of this statute are disjunctive, so findings that satisfy one subsection are sufficient for a court to issue an injunction. <em>Sweet Grass Farms, v. Board of County </em>Com'rs, 2000 MT 147, \u00b6 27, 300 Mont. 66, \u00b6 27, 2 P.3d 825, \u00b6 27. Notably, however, of the statutory subsections that could arguably apply here, each contemplates the restraining of the commission of an act, the continuance of an act, and/or the threat that an act adverse to the opposing party\u2019s interests will be undertaken, as a predicate to the issuance of an injunction. None of these sections contemplates the issuance of an injunction to correct a wrong that has already been committed and completed. Here, although the ditch was already completely destroyed by the time Zaveta sought the injunction, the District Court nonetheless granted Zaveta\u2019s request for a preliminary injunction and imposed an order requiring Mustang to restore the ditch.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-5\">\u00b614 Mustang argues that Zaveta\u2019s damages can be compensated monetarily and thus, do not satisfy the \u201cgreat or irreparable injury\u201d prerequisite for a preliminary injunction. More to the point, the question we must first address is whether this case, given its posture when presented to the District Court on a prayer for injunctive relief, is even amenable to an order for preliminary injunction.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-6\">\u00b615 In <em>Bouma v. Bynum Irrigation District, </em>139 Mont. 360, 364 P.2d 47 (1961), the plaintiff sought relief from a judgment of the district court denying his request for injunctive relief under somewhat similar circumstances. We affirmed the district court, noting that activity undertaken by the parties with respect to irrigation ditches had been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>completed prior to the time that the preliminary injunction was sought. Therefore, we concluded, remedy by injunction was moot. We said: \u201cAn injunction will not issue to restrain an act already committed. Injunction is not an appropriate remedy to procure relief for past injuries, it is to afford preventive relief only.\u201d <em>Bouma, </em>139 Mont. at 364, 364 P.2d at 49 (internal citations omitted). We then quoted <em>Mallon v. City of Long Beach, </em>330 P.2d 423, 431, for the following proposition:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-4\">If... there is no reasonable probability that past acts complained of will recur, injunctive relief will be denied. Injunction power is not used as punishment for past acts and is ordered against them only if there is evidence they will probably recur.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b499-5\"><em>Bouma, </em>139 Mont. at 364, 364 P.2d at 49. Likewise, we held in <em>Billings </em>Assoc. <em>Plumbing, Etc. v. State Bd., </em>184 Mont. 249, 255, 602 P.2d 597, 601 (1979), that where the entire injury is in the past, an injunction cannot issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-6\">\u00b616  Here, the entire injury is in the past, as the ditch was completely destroyed well before the court could enter any type of injunctive relief. Thus, under the clear language of \u00a7 27-19-201, MCA, and the cases cited above, this was not a case suitable for the issuance of a preliminary injunction. By the time the District Court was requested to act, there was nothing to enjoin.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-7\">\u00b617 This is not to say that Zaveta is not entitled to relief. In the event she prevails at the trial of the action for declaratory judgment, then she may present evidence as to the damages she has sustained as a result of the destruction of the ditch. The District Court would have the authority at this juncture to order Mustang to restore the ditch and if indicated, permanently enjoin Mustang from further interference with Zaveta\u2019s easement rights. <em>See Butler v. Germann, </em>251 Mont. 107, 113-114, 822 P.2d 1067, 1071 (1991)(overruled on other grounds by <em>Shammel v. Canyon Resources Corp., </em>2003 MT 372, 319 Mont. 132, 82 P.3d 912). However, these determinations must await final resolution of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-8\">\u00b618  For the foregoing reasons, the District Court\u2019s decision to issue a preliminary injunction was unmistakably erroneous. Consequently, we conclude that the District Court manifestly abused its discretion. We therefore reverse the Order granting Zaveta a preliminary injunction. In light of this, we likewise reverse the District Court\u2019s award of attorney fees to Zaveta.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-9\">\u00b619 Reversed and remanded for further proceedings consistent with this Opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b500-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES NELSON and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b500-4\">JUSTICE MORRIS</author>\n<p id=\"ArD\">dissents.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-5\">\u00b620 The Court\u2019s decision unnecessarily rewards Mustang\u2019s brazen behavior in interfering with Zaveta\u2019s one-hundred-and-twenty-year-old water right. I disagree with the Court\u2019s reasoning and I cannot countenance its conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-6\">\u00b621 Since 1884, water flowed annually from Lolo Creek through the Hendrickson-Kuney Ditch across the property now held by Mustang to irrigate Zaveta\u2019s property. The water abruptly stopped flowing in 2004 when Mustang bulldozed the ditch. Aggressive behavior of this type characterized Mustang\u2019s dealings with Zaveta from the outset. Mustang, not Zaveta, initiated this declaratory judgment action on July 31, 2003.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-7\">\u00b622 Mustang moved for summary judgment on December 4,2003, no doubt prompted by the fact that the Water Court had reinstated Zaveta\u2019s water rights on November 4, 2003. The Water Court\u2019s apparent termination of Zaveta\u2019s water rights in 1999 served as the lynchpin of Mustang\u2019s claim that the Hendrickson-Kuney Ditch no longer constituted a valid easement across its property.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-8\">\u00b623 Mustang never bothered to inform the District Court that the Water Court had reinstated Zaveta\u2019s water rights by the time it had filed its motion for summary judgment. When apprised of this fact by Zaveta in its brief in opposition to summary judgment, Mustang wrongly argued that the Water Court\u2019s termination of Zaveta\u2019s water rights automatically had extinguished any prescriptive easement that Zaveta may have had across its property. As noted by the Court, however, Zaveta continued to use the Hendrickson-Kuney Ditch uninterrupted from the time of the Water Court\u2019s termination of her water rights in 1999 through its reinstatement of her water rights in 2003. \u00b6 6. Uninterrupted and continuous use constitutes a critical element of a prescriptive easement. <em>Brimstone Mining, Inc. v. Glaus, </em>2003 MT 236, \u00b6 21, 317 Mont. 236, \u00b6 21, 77 P.3d 175, \u00b6 21.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-9\">\u00b624 Not surprisingly the District Court denied Mustang\u2019s motion for summary judgment. The District Court reached this conclusion after finding that the \u201clong history\u201d of use by Zaveta and her predecessors of the ditch across Mustang\u2019s property and the resolution of Zaveta\u2019s water rights by the Water Court raised genuine issues of material fact-material indeed-regarding the viability of Mustang\u2019s claim that Zaveta no longer had a valid easement across its property. The District Court issued its order denying Mustang\u2019s motion for summary judgment on August 20, 2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>\u00b625 Mustang alleges that after the District Court denied its motion for summary judgment, \u201cthis matter sat idle.\u201d Mustang, apparently seeing the writing on the wall, however, refused to sit idle and engaged in what can be described only as \u201cself-help\u201d to improve its litigation position. Mustang simply bulldozed the ditch. Mustang gave no notice to Zaveta. As she attested in her affidavit, \u201c[n]o one from Mustang Holdings communicated with me <em>in any way </em>before destroying the only ditch through which I can convey my irrigation water to my property.\u201d (Emphasis added). Mustang gave no notice to the district court. It simply wiped off the map a one-hundred-and-twenty-year-old ditch one fine winter day in November or December of 2004. The Court cannot even pinpoint the date of Mustang\u2019s destruction in light of the fact that Mustang never told anyone of its activities. Mustang likely recognized that someone might have said no if it had asked permission-better to act first without permission and seek to apologize later. Mustang has not even brought itself to apologize. Mustang instead cavalierly asserts that it \u201chas numerous and improved assets to satisfy any judgment that may be entered\u201d to cover Zaveta\u2019s loss of her easement across its property.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-4\">\u00b626 Zaveta moved for a preliminary injunction on March 16,2005, in response to Mustang\u2019s bulldozing of the ditch. She alleged that Mustang violated \u00a7 70-17-112, MCA, which prohibits interference with a party\u2019s ditch easements. Mustang insisted repeatedly throughout the hearing on Zaveta\u2019s motion for prehminary injunction that the Water Court lacked jurisdiction to reinstate Zaveta\u2019s water rights. The District Court disagreed and determined that for purposes of Zaveta\u2019s motion for preliminary injunction, the Water Court had reinstated Zaveta\u2019s water rights \u201cgoing back to the water right that was issued on April 1, 1890.\u201d Mustang never appealed this determination, and we must take it to be true for purposes of this appeal. As we noted in <em>Sweet Grass Farms, Ltd. v. Board of County </em>Commrs., 2000 MT 147, \u00b6 38, 300 Mont. 66, \u00b6 38, 2 P.3d 825, \u00b6 38, \u201c[i]n determining the merits of a preliminary injunction, \u2018[i]t is not the province of either the District Court or the Supreme Court on appeal to determine finally matters that may arise upon a trial on the merits.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b501-5\">\u00b627 The District Court granted Zaveta\u2019s motion for a prehminary injunction. In response, Mustang\u2019s counsel taunted the District Court at the conclusion of the hearing: \u2018Would you like the notice of appeal today or tomorrow?\u201d Unfortunately the Court rewards such bravado when it focuses on Mustang\u2019s completed destruction of the Hendrickson-Kuney Ditch, \u00b6 13, rather than on Mustang\u2019s continuing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>and on-going interference with Zaveta\u2019s easement across Mustang\u2019s property. As Zaveta attested in her affidavit, she has \u201cno other means of irrigating [her] pasture.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b502-4\">\u00b628 The Court relies on our decision in <em>Bouma v. Bynum Irrigation </em>Dist., 139 Mont. 360, 364 P.2d 47 (1961), to support its conclusion that an injunction cannot remedy \u201can act already committed.\u201d \u00b6 15. In <em>Bouma, </em>however, the plaintiff sought an injunction to prevent the owner of a canal across his property from allowing wastewater to accumulate in the canal and periodically spill onto plaintiffs property. The canal owner took several steps to remedy the problem during the pendency of the litigation that the plaintiff deemed inadequate. As a result, the plaintiff \u201cresorted to the age-old remedy of self-help\u201d before the trial and constructed a series of dams where the canal entered his property. <em>Bouma, </em>139 Mont. at 363, 364 P.2d at 49. At that point, the Court refused to grant injunctive relief to the plaintiff where the harm had stopped occurring: \u201cThe dams, as indicated by the record, are still in place. Therefore, it is apparent that the remedy by injunction has become moot.\u201d <em>Bouma, </em>139 Mont. at 363-64, 364 P.2d at 49.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-5\">\u00b629 Here the harm continues unabated. As determined by the Water Court, ratified by the District Court for purposes of Zaveta\u2019s motion for preliminary injunction, and binding on us for purposes of this appeal, Zaveta holds two valid water rights to water from Lolo Creek. Zaveta has no means, other than the now destroyed Hendrickson-Kuney Ditch, to convey her water to her property. Remedy by injunction has not \u201cbecome moot.\u201d <em>Bouma, </em>139 Mont. at 363-64, 364 P.2d at 49.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-6\">\u00b630 The situation would be no different if Mustang had followed the lead of the plaintiff in <em>Bouma </em>and erected a plastic irrigation dam across the Hendrickson-Kuney Ditch where it entered its property instead of bulldozing it. Mustang would argue that preliminary injunctive relief would not be available because the harm that Zaveta seeks to prevent already has occurred-it had blocked the ditch. I have no doubt that this Court would affirm the District Court\u2019s order granting a preliminary injunction under those circumstances. The Court would order Mustang simply to remove the plastic dam and allow the irrigation water to flow, as it has for the past one-hundred- and-twenty years, during the pendency of Mustang\u2019s declaratory judgment action. The preliminary injunction would relate to Mustang\u2019s continued encroachment or impairment of Zaveta\u2019s easement.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-7\">\u00b631 I say that the Court would order Mustang to remove the dam based on our decision in <em>Butler v. Germann, </em>251 Mont. 107, 822 P.2d 1067 (1991), <em>overruled in part on other grounds, Shammel v. Canyon </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number><em>Resources Corp., </em>2003 MT 372, \u00b6 12, 319 Mont. 132, \u00b6 12, 82 P.3d 912, \u00b6 12. There Germann modified the Butlers\u2019 irrigation ditch without their permission, including \u201cblad[ing] off from 12 to 18 inches of the downslope bank\u201d and using the dirt as fill in his own barnyard. <em>Butler, </em>251 Mont. at 109, 822 P.2d at 1069. The district court granted a preliminary injunction ordering Germann to raise the banks of the ditch. <em>Butler, </em>251 Mont. at 109, 822 P.2d at 1069. We affirmed the district court\u2019s injunction requiring Germann to raise the banks of the irrigation ditch to its former height despite the fact that Germann\u2019s unauthorized blading already had occurred. <em>Butler, </em>251 Mont. at 113, 822 P.2d at 1071.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-4\">\u00b632 Similar to Mustang\u2019s bulldozing of the Hendrickson-Kuney Ditch, Germann\u2019s unauthorized blading was completed by the time that the injured party sought a preliminary injunction. <em>Butler, </em>251 Mont. at 109, 822 P.2d at 1069. The district court did not stop with simply requiring Germann to restore the banks of the ditch to their former heights. The testimony presented at trial indicated that restoring the banks would not necessarily restore the ditch\u2019s former water carrying capacity in light of the sandy loam soil in the area. The district court also ordered further repairs that it found necessary to restore the ditch\u2019s integrity, including heightening and thickening the banks, replanting vegetation on the banks, and lining the ditch. <em>Butler, </em>251 Mont. at 113, 822 P.2d at 1071. We affirmed this mandatory injunction based upon our conclusion that the \u201cfundamental purpose of any remedy is to return the plaintiff to his or her rightful position, \u2018the position or state the party would have attained had the [wrong] not occurred.\u2019\u201d <em>Butler, </em>251 Mont. at 110, 822 P.2d at 1069.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-5\">\u00b633 The outcome likewise would be similar if Mustang and Zaveta had followed the normal course. Mustang would have made noises about cutting off Zaveta\u2019s easement and even may have resorted to minor acts of sabotage that fall into the category of nuisances. And Zaveta, rather than Mustang, likely would have filed an action to abate the nuisances to ensure the continued viability of its easement. This Court has consistently held that an injunction is a proper remedy to abate a continuing nuisance. <em>Boyer v. Karagacin, </em>178 Mont. 26, 32, 582 P.2d 1173, 1177-78 (1978), <em>overruled in part on other grounds, Shammel, </em>\u00b6 12; <em>Floyd v. City of Butte, </em>147 Mont. 305, 313, 412 P.2d 823, 827 (1966); <em>Wilhite v. Billings &amp; Eastern Montana Power Co., </em>39 Mont. 1, 11, 101 P. 168, 171 (1909). Damages are inadequate in cases of continuing nuisance because the injured party is forced to bring a multiplicity of suits in successive actions for the recurring injury. <em>See Floyd, </em>147 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>Mont. at 313, 412 P.2d at 827; <em>Hart v. Wagner, </em>40 A.2d 47, 51 (Md. 1944).</p>\n<p id=\"b504-4\">\u00b634 The outcome should be no different here where Mustang has elected to forego preliminaries and wipe the Hendrickson-Kuney Ditch off the map. The end result is the same-Mustang has encroached or impaired, and will continue to encroach or impair, Zaveta\u2019s easement during the pendency of Mustang\u2019s declaratory judgment action. I fear that by its decision today the Court announces a new twist on an old adage along the lines of \u201cthe Court helps those who help themselves.\u201d The Mustangs of the world will get the message loud and clear.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-5\">\u00b635 The Legislature has determined that easements conveying irrigation water, in the form of ditches, play such an important role in the agricultural life of Montana, that it has singled out irrigation ditches from all other types of easements as deserving of special protection. Section 70-17-112(2), MCA, provides that no person may \u201cencroach upon or otherwise impair\u201d any ditch used for irrigation water. The statute includes specifically any \u201cditch easement obtained by prescription,\u201d \u00a7 70-17-112(4), MCA, and consequently the protections of the statute would apply to Zaveta\u2019s ditch easement. No doubt exists that Mustang has \u201cencroach[ed] upon or otherwise impair[ed]\u201d Zaveta\u2019s ditch that she used for irrigation water. They bulldozed it. If Zaveta were to prevail on the declaratory judgment complaint, Mustang has encroached or impaired her irrigation ditch by bulldozing it in contravention of \u00a7 70-17-112(2), MCA. It is well settled that wrongful conduct of this type would be subject to potential injunctive relief. See <em>e.g. Engel v. Gampp, </em>2000 MT 17, \u00b6 56, 298 Mont. 116, \u00b6 56, 993 P.3d 701, \u00b6 56 (upholding district court\u2019s enjoinment of interference with dominant tenant owner\u2019s secondary easement to access irrigation ditch under \u00a7 70-17-112(4), MCA), <em>overruled in part on other grounds, Shammel, </em>\u00b6 12; <em>Ducham v. Tuma, </em>265 Mont. 436, 442-43, 877 P.2d 1002, 1007 (1994) (enjoining trespass), <em>overruled in part on other grounds, Shammel, </em>\u00b6 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-6\">\u00b636 As discussed above in <em>Butler, </em>we affirmed the district court\u2019s mandatory injunction requiring the Germanns to restore the irrigation ditch to its former height. <em>Butler, </em>251 Mont. at 113, 822 P.2d at 1071. We recognized the need for the mandatory injunction as the sole remedy available to return the Butlers to their former position. We also justified the mandatory injunction in light of the Germanns\u2019 violation of \u00a7 70-17-112, MCA. <em>Butler, </em>251 Mont. at 114, 822 P.2d at 1072. Likewise in <em>Engel, </em>\u00b6 58, we affirmed the district court\u2019s order enjoining the Gampps from interfering with the Engels\u2019 exercise of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>their <em>secondary </em>easement rights under \u00a7 70-17-112(1), MCA. Mustang has interfered, and will continue to interfere, with Zaveta\u2019s <em>primary </em>easement rights -under \u00a7 70-17-112, MCA, during the pendency of this litigation. The District Court\u2019s order provides the sole remedy for the type of self-help employed by Mustang in this instance.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-4\">\u00b637 The Court nevertheless concludes that the District Court\u2019s decision to issue a preliminary injunction was a manifest abuse of discretion. \u00b6 18. The Court stops short its analysis upon determining that \u201cthe entire injury is in the past\u201d and therefore \u201cthis was not a case suitable for the issuance of a preliminary injunction.\u201d \u00b6 16. As I discussed in \u00b6 29, however, Mustang continues to encroach or impair Zaveta\u2019s easement. Zaveta\u2019s easement, in the form of the Hendrickson-Kuney Ditch, no longer could carry Zaveta\u2019s irrigation water on whatever winter day in 2004 that Mustang bulldozed it, it cannot carry Zaveta\u2019s irrigation water today, and it will not be able to carry Zaveta\u2019s irrigation water in the future. The Court should have proceeded to analyze whether Zaveta demonstrated sufficiently to the District Court that the situation warrants preservation of her property or rights in <em>status quo </em>until trial. <em>Sweet Grass Farms, </em>\u00b6 28.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-5\">\u00b638 We have defined the <em>status quo </em>as \u201c\u2018the last actual, peaceable, noncontested condition which preceded the pending controversy.\u2019\u201d <em>Sweet Grass Farms, </em>\u00b6 28. Mustang claims that its act of self-help in bulldozing the ditch changed the <em>status quo </em>in its favor. It contends that the act for which Zaveta seeks a preliminary injunction \u201chas already occurred and completed,\u201d and thus, there is \u201cno <em>status quo </em>to protect.\u201d The \u201cpending controversy\u201d began on July 31,2003, however, when Mustang filed an action seeking declaratory relief in a complaint to extinguish any easement Zaveta may have held to transport water through the irrigation ditch on Mustang\u2019s property. As a result, \u201cthe last actual, peaceable, noncontested condition which preceded the pending controversy\u2019 included the existence of the ditch on Mustang\u2019s property.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-6\">\u00b639 Interpreting <em>status quo </em>in the instant case to relate back to the condition of the ditch when Zaveta filed the motion for a preliminary injunction, rather than the ditch\u2019s condition at the time Mustang filed its complaint, will allow Mustang, or other impatient real-estate developers, to interfere with whomever\u2019s ditch easement they choose, content with the knowledge it \u201chas numerous and improved assets to satisfy any judgment that may be entered.\u201d Zaveta\u2019s use of the irrigation ditch preceded the pending controversy. Consequently, an irrigation ditch that carries water to Zaveta\u2019s property is the <em>status quo </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>in the instant case. <em>See Sweet Grass Farms, </em>\u00b6 28.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-4\">\u00b640 I would preserve the <em>status quo </em>as it existed when Mustang filed its complaint on July 31, 2003. I would affirm the District Court\u2019s mandatory injunction directing Mustang to restore the Hendrickson-Kuney Ditch to the condition in which it existed on that date. I dissent from the Court\u2019s failure to do so.</p>\n<judges id=\"b506-5\">JUSTICES LEAPHART and WARNER join in the foregoing dissent.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
