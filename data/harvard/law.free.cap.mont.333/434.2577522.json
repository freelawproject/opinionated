The Fourth Judicial District Court, Missoula County, dismissed Sikorskis\u2019 claims against defendant Western Montana Clinic, P.C., (Clinic) and granted the motion for judgment on the pleadings filed by defendants State of Montana, Department of Justice, Montana Highway Patrol, and Department of Motor Vehicles, Drivers\u2019 Services Bureau (collectively, State defendants), on the basis that no duty existed. Sikorskis appeal, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-9\">\u00b62 Sikorskis raise two issues:</p>\n<p id=\"b460-10\">\u00b63 1. Did the District Court err in granting the Clinic\u2019s motion to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>dismiss?</p>\n<p id=\"b461-4\">\u00b64 2. Did the District Court err in granting the State defendants\u2019 motion for judgment on the pleadings?</p>\n<p id=\"b461-5\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b461-6\">\u00b65 James Neumayer, Kaitlyn Neumayer and Amber Knutsen died from injuries they sustained in a three-vehicle collision on U.S. Highway 93 South in Missoula, Montana, on June 8, 2000. Sikorskis-the survivors and legal representatives of the estates of the decedents-filed a complaint alleging Johnson\u2019s negligent failure to properly control his diabetes resulted in his negligent operation of his vehicle and caused the collision. Sikorskis also allege negligence against the Clinic, where Johnson was a patient. They contend the Clime knew or should have known from its medical evaluations of Johnson that he was unfit to drive, and should have reported him to the State of Montana, Department of Motor Vehicles, Drivers\u2019 Services Bureau. Finally, Sikorskis argue that, after employees of the State of Montana investigated a single-car accident involving Johnson in February of 2000, the State defendants should have known Johnson was suffering from dangerous conditions caused by his failure to properly control his diabetes, was unfit to operate a motor vehicle and constituted a menace to the motoring public. On that basis, they contend the State defendants breached \u201ctheir duties to investigate, supervise, disseminate information about, coordinate, and monitor those persons unable to safely operate motor vehicles upon Montana highways.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b461-7\">\u00b66 The Clinic moved to dismiss the claim against it based on the absence of a duty to Sikorskis and the physicians\u2019 immunity provision contained in \u00a7 37-2-312, MCA. The State defendants moved for judgment on the pleadings, asserting they owed no legal duty to the individual plaintiffs and, moreover, were immune under the doctrine of quasi-judicial immunity. Sikorskis moved to convert the State defendants\u2019 motion for judgment on the pleadings to a motion for summary judgment. Following briefing, the District Court entered an opinion and order granting both the Clinic\u2019s and the State defendants\u2019 motions. Stating it had not considered any matters outside the pleadings, the court determined Sikorskis\u2019 motion to convert was moot. Sikorskis then moved for M. R. Civ. P. 54(b) certification of the District Court\u2019s order, and the District Court certified its opinion and order for appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-8\">\u00b67 In September of2005, after the parties filed their briefs on appeal, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>we determined the District Court had failed to consider Sikorskis\u2019 claims against the State defendants under the statutes in effect at the time the collision occurred. As a result, we remanded for the District Court\u2019s reconsideration of the State defendants\u2019 motion for judgment on the pleadings under the 1999 version of the statutes. On remand, the District Court again granted the State defendants\u2019 motion for judgment on the pleadings. The parties have rebriefed that portion of the appeal, and both issues are now ready for our review.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-4\">STANDARDS OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b462-5\">\u00b68  A motion to dismiss a complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted has the effect of admitting all wellpled allegations in the complaint, which are to be taken as true. A determination that a complaint fails to state a claim upon which relief can be granted is a conclusion of law which we review to determine whether the district court\u2019s interpretation of the law is correct. <em>Dukes v. Sirius Const., Inc., </em>2003 MT 152, \u00b6 11, 316 Mont. 226, \u00b6 11, 73 P.3d 781, \u00b6 11 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b462-6\">\u00b69  Similarly, when a district court rules on a motion for judgment on the pleadings, the pleadings are to be considered in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party. Because a motion for judgment on the pleadings is decided as a matter of law, we determine whether the district court\u2019s conclusions of law are correct. <em>See Paulson v. Flathead Conservation Dist., </em>2004 MT 136, \u00b6 17, 321 Mont. 364, \u00b6 17, 91 P.3d 569, \u00b6 17 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b462-7\">ISSUE 1</p>\n<p id=\"b462-8\">\u00b610 Did the District Court err in granting the Clinic\u2019s motion to dismiss?</p>\n<p id=\"b462-9\">\u00b611 A claim may be dismissed under M. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted only if it appears beyond a doubt that the plaintiffs can prove no set of facts in support of the claim which would entitle them to relief. A Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss has the effect of admitting all well-pled allegations in the complaint. <em>Dukes, </em>\u00b6 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-10\">\u00b612 A professional corporation whose employee performs professional services within the scope of his or her employment or apparent authority to act for the corporation is liable to the same extent as the employee. <em>See </em>\u00a7 35-4-404(2), MCA. Sikorskis\u2019 wrongful death, survival and personal injury claims against the Clinic are based on alleged negligence and gross negligence via unnamed Clinic employees\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>failures to report Johnson to the State of Montana, Department of Motor Vehicles, Drivers\u2019 Services Bureau.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-4\">\u00b613  A claim of negligence involves four elements: duty, breach of duty, causation and damages. <em>Massee v. Thompson, </em>2004 MT 121, \u00b6 41, 321 Mont. 210, \u00b6 41, 90 P.3d 394, \u00b6 41 (citation omitted). The question of whether a duty exists is one of law. Absent a duty, breach of duty cannot be established and a negligence action cannot be maintained. <em>Debcon, Inc. v. City of Glasgow, </em>2001 MT 124, \u00b6 29, 305 Mont. 391, \u00b6 29, 28 P.3d 478, \u00b6 29 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b463-5\">\u00b614 The District Court determined, as a matter of law, that the Clinic had no legal duty to Sikorskis. It relied on \u00a7 37-2-311(1), MCA, which provides that a physician who diagnoses a physical or mental condition which will significantly impair a person\u2019s ability to safely operate a motor vehicle \u201cmay voluntarily\u201d report the person\u2019s name to the Department of Justice (DO J). The court also concluded that the Clinic was immune from any liability pursuant to \u00a7 37-2-312, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-6\">\u00b615 In interpreting statutes, we pursue the intent of the Legislature, which we determine, if possible, by the plain meaning of the language used. <em>Saari v. Winter Sports, Inc., </em>2003 MT 31, \u00b6 22, 314 Mont. 212, \u00b6 22, 64 P.3d 1038, \u00b6 22 (citation omitted). A court\u2019s function is to construe statutes as it finds them, not to insert what has been omitted. Section 1-2-101, MCA; <em>Greens at Fort Missoula, LLC v. City of Missoula, </em>271 Mont. 398, 403, 897 P.2d 1078, 1080 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b463-7\">\u00b616  Sikorskis do not dispute the District Court\u2019s conclusion that the \u201creporting\u201d language of \u00a7 37-2-311(1), MCA, is permissive rather than mandatory. Therefore, we conclude the District Court did not err in determining that the Clinic had no duty to \u201creport or disseminate\u201d pursuant to \u00a7 37-2-311(1), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-8\">\u00b617 Sikorskis also do not dispute the clear language in the second sentence of \u00a7 37-2-312, MCA, that \u201c[n]o action may be brought against a physician for not making a report pursuant to 37-2-311.\u201d They argue, however, that \u00a7 37-2-312, MCA, does not provide immunity from liability for damages occasioned by gross negligence, relying on the first sentence of that statute, which grants immunity to \u201c[a]ny physician reporting in good faith ... except for damages occasioned by gross negligence.\u201d They claim evidence-including two previous reports by the Clinic to the DOJ on April 25, 1997, and September 23, 1997, concerning Johnson\u2019s diabetic condition-would support the allegation in their complaint that the Clinic acted with gross negligence in failing to report Johnson. Consequently, according to Sikorskis, the District Court failed to give them the benefit of the most favorable reading of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>their complaint. Here, however, the threshold issue is whether, even taking as true the factual portion of Sikorskis\u2019 allegation that the Clinic\u2019s failure to report constituted gross negligence, \u00a7 37-2-312, MCA, provides the Clinic with immunity as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-4\">\u00b618  The first sentence of \u00a7 37-2-312, MCA, grants a physician who voluntarily reports a patient immunity from liability except in the event damages result from gross negligence. The second sentence of \u00a7 37-2-312, MCA, grants complete immunity to a physician who does not make a report regarding a patient. In construing a statute, a court is to ascertain and declare what is contained therein, not to insert what has been omitted. Section 1-2-101, MCA; <em>Greens, </em>271 Mont. at 403, 897 P.2d at 1080. The Legislature having declined to provide an exception from immunity when a physician does not report a patient, we cannot insert such an exception into \u00a7 37-2-312, MCA. Thus, taking as true Sikorskis\u2019 allegations that the Clinic did not report Johnson, we conclude \u00a7 37-2-312, MCA, does not impose a duty to report or subject a physician who does not report to liability. Therefore, we further conclude the District Court did not err in interpreting the plain language of \u00a7 37-2-312, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-5\">\u00b619 Sikorskis also claim the Clinic waived immunity from liability under \u00a7 37-2-312, MCA, because it had reported Johnson to the DOJ on two previous occasions. They advance <em>Idaho Asphalt Supply v. State, Dept. of Transp., </em>1999 MT 291, \u00b6 19, 297 Mont. 66, \u00b6 19, 991 P.2d 434, \u00b6 19 (citation omitted), solely for the definition of \u201cwaiver\u201d as the voluntary and intentional relinquishment of a known right or privilege which may be proven by express declarations or by a course of acts and conduct so as to induce the belief that the intention and purpose was to waive the right or privilege. Sikorskis rely on <em>Montana Mining Properties, Inc. v. ASARCO, Inc., </em>270 Mont. 458, 893 P.2d 325 (1995), for the proposition that waiver is a material question of fact not susceptible to a pretrial motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-6\">\u00b620 <em>Montana Mining Properties </em>was an action for breach of a contract for the sale of mining property. The issue on appeal was whether the district court had correctly granted summary judgment on grounds that the defendant seller had waived his right to terminate the contract by delivering to the buyer documents which appeared to maintain that the contract had been terminated by breach and, inconsistently, to acknowledge the continuing existence of a contractual right of first refusal. We reversed and remanded for trial, holding that the intent of the seller and whether he had voluntarily waived his right to terminate the contract were questions of material <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>fact. <em>Montana Mining Properties, </em>270 Mont. at 466, 893 P.2d at 330.</p>\n<p id=\"AMX\">\u00b621 <em>Montana Mining Properties </em>did not involve the waiver of a right to statutory immunity and does not support the proposition that prior voluntary reports pursuant to \u00a7 37-2-311, MCA, may \u2014 depending on the facts-constitute a waiver of the immunity provided under \u00a7 37-2-312, MCA. Thus, <em>Montana Mining Properties </em>is of no assistance to Sikorskis, and they have provided no other authority to support their claim that any earlier reports made by the Clinic constitute a waiver of \u00a7 37-2-312, MCA, immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-4\">\u00b622 Finally, Sikorskis argue that their complaint states a claim against the Clinic for failure to warn Johnson not to drive. Sikorskis rely on two cases from other jurisdictions-Myers <em>v. Quesenberry, </em>144 Cal.App.3d 888 (Cal. App. 1983), and <em>Joy v. Eastern Maine Medical Center, </em>529 A.2d 1364 (Maine 1987)-in support of their failure to warn theory. Sikorskis raised this argument to the District Court in their brief opposing the Clinic\u2019s motion to dismiss, but the complaint contains no claim of failure to warn, and the District Court did not address it.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-5\">\u00b623 We liberally construe pleadings. <em>See Ryan v. City of Bozeman, </em>279 Mont. 507, 513, 928 P.2d 228, 232 (1996) (citation omitted). However, we cannot properly create a cause of action not explicitly or implicitly stated in Sikorskis\u2019 complaint against the Clinic where none exists, especially when well-pled allegations must be taken as true in considering a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim. Therefore, we decline to consider this argument further.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-6\">\u00b624  We hold that the District Court did not err in granting the Clinic\u2019s motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-7\">ISSUE 2</p>\n<p id=\"b465-8\">\u00b625 Did the District Court err in granting the State defendants\u2019 motion for judgment on the pleadings?</p>\n<p id=\"b465-9\">\u00b626 Like their claim against the Clinic, Sikorskis\u2019 claim against the State defendants is negligence-based. Sikorskis alleged that the State defendants negligently breached their duties to \u201cinvestigate, supervise, disseminate information about, coordinate, and monitor\u201d people-such as Johnson-unable to safely operate their vehicles, and that the breaches caused the three deaths at issue here. On remand, the District Court concluded the State defendants owed no duty under the 1999 version of the statutes and went on to determine that a decision regarding whether to issue, suspend or revoke a driver\u2019s license qualifies for common law quasi-judicial immunity. The court granted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>the State defendants judgment on the pleadings on those grounds, among others. For the reasons discussed below, we agree with the District Court\u2019s decision on the absence of a duty. Consequently, we need not reach Sikorskis\u2019 arguments relating to quasi-judicial immunity, the public duty doctrine or a special relationship exception to the public duty doctrine here.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-4\">\u00b627 As a threshold matter, we attempt to address Sikorskis\u2019 argument relating to whether the District Court considered matters outside the pleadings and whether-or the extent to which-such consideration constituted error of some kind. As background, we observe that Sikorskis moved to amend their complaint four months before the trial court\u2019s original order on pending motions. They attached two exhibits to that motion, which sought to identify a State law enforcement officer as defendant John Doe I. In its original order granting the Clinic\u2019s motion to dismiss and the State defendants\u2019 motion for judgment on the pleadings, the District Court deemed the motion to amend moot on immunity grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-5\">\u00b628 On appeal from the order on remand, Sikorskis contend that the District Court considered one of the exhibits attached to their motion to amend, but should have considered both. Later, however, they contend the court refused to consider either because the matters were outside the pleadings. As a result, we are at a loss to understand even Sikorskis\u2019 underlying premise. In any event, however, Sikorskis do not explain how the exhibits attached to their motion to amend could have substantially affected the District Court\u2019s analysis of the State defendants\u2019 motion for judgment on the pleadings. For those reasons, we do not address this matter further.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-6\">\u00b629 As noted above, after the parties filed their briefs on appeal, we remanded the case to the District Court for consideration of Sikorskis\u2019 claims under the 1999 statutes in effect at the time the collision occurred, rather than the 2003 statutes in effect at the time the court\u2019s original order was entered. In its opinion and order on remand, the District Court stated the parties had concurred that the two versions of the statutes are identical except that the 1999 version of \u00a7 61-5-206(1), MCA, includes additional grounds for revoking or suspending a driver\u2019s license. The court concluded that difference did not constitute cause to alter its previous determination that the State defendants owed no duty to Sikorskis. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-7\">\u00b630  Under \u00a7 61-5-206, MCA (1999), the DOJ \u201cmay\u201d suspend the driver\u2019s license of a person who has been involved as a driver in any accident resulting in death, injury or serious property damage. Thus, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>while \u00a7 61-5-206(1), MCA (1999), enumerates more circumstances under which the DOJ may suspend a driver\u2019s license than does the 2003 version of that statute, the authority remains discretionary. Similarly, if the DOJ receives reliable evidence that a licensed driver lacks the ability to exercise ordinary and reasonable control in safely operating a vehicle on the highway, it \u201cmay\u201d require the licensee to obtain a medical evaluation or submit to one or more tests and, upon review, \u201cmay\u201d restrict or suspend the license, or it \u201cmay\u201d take no action modifying the license. <em>See </em>\u00a7 61-5-207(1) and (2), MCA (1999). By using \u201cmay\u201d in these statutes, the Legislature has provided the DOJ discretionary authority to act or decline to act. We conclude the statutes do not create a duty on the part of the DOJ. Absent a duty, Sikorskis cannot succeed in their claim of negligence against the State defendants, even taking their well-pled allegations of fact as true. <em>See Debcon, </em>\u00b6 29. We hold the District Court did not err in granting the State defendants\u2019 motion for judgment on the pleadings.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-4\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b467-5\">\u00b631  We hold the District Court did not err in granting the Clinic\u2019s motion to dismiss, because the Clinic was immune from liability under \u00a7 37-2-312, MCA. We further hold the District Court did not err in granting the State defendants\u2019 motion for judgment on the pleadings, because the State defendants had no statutory duty to suspend or revoke Johnson\u2019s driver\u2019s license.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-6\">\u00b632 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b467-7\">JUSTICES NELSON, LEAPHART, WARNER and COTTER concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
