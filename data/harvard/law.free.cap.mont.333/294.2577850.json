We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-9\">\u00b62 We address the following issues Jones presents on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b319-10\">\u00b63 1) Did the District Court err when it denied Jones\u2019s motion to suppress statements Jones provided to police officers during a December 31, 2002, interview?</p>\n<p id=\"b319-12\">\u00b64 2) Did the District Court err when it denied Jones\u2019s motion to suppress the coat that the police took from Jones\u2019s home?</p>\n<p id=\"b319-13\">PROCEDURAL AND FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b319-14\">\u00b65 The night security patrol for the Eagles\u2019 Manor retirement home in Lewistown, Montana, discovered seventy-year-old Gisela dead in her apartment on the evening of December 16, 2002. Gisela had died of severe blunt force injuries to her head, strangulation or suffocation, and four stab wounds to her neck. Gisela also had been sexually assaulted before her death. Fergus County police initiated the investigation by seeking to interview probationers and parolees who had not reported during the time period surrounding the homicide. Fergus County Probation Officer Jim Simonich (Simonich) assisted the police in locating some of his probationers.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-15\">\u00b66 Simonich supervised Jones\u2019s probation. Jones had failed to report to Simonich in early December 2002. Simonich went with police to Jones\u2019s house, and informed Jones\u2019s brother and mother that the police wanted to talk to him. Simonich issued an arrest warrant for Jones\u2019s failure to report on December 30, 2002. Jones belatedly reported to Simonich on December 31, 2002. Simonich testified that Jones was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>\u201ccalm, polite, a little bit joking, ... no different than he had been any other time that he reported.\u201d Simonich informed Jones that the police wanted to talk with him regarding the homicide that had occurred two weeks earlier. Jones said that he had nothing to hide and agreed to speak with police. Simonich called the police department to advise that Jones was on the way. Jones walked to the police station unaccompanied by Simonich.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-4\">\u00b67 Officer Travis Tilleman (Tilleman) spoke with Jones in an interview room at the police station and videotaped the conversation. The door to the interview room closed automatically, but was not locked. Tilleman promptly advised Jones of his <em>Miranda </em>rights. Jones signed the statement indicating that he understood his rights and also signed the waiver. The two engaged in what Tilleman described to be a \u201creal free, full, and open conversation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b320-5\">\u00b68 Jones denied having seen Gisela the day of the homicide, and provided a written statement detailing his whereabouts on the evening of the homicide. Tilleman inquired about a cut he noticed on Jones\u2019s hand and Jones responded that he received the cut in a fight with his friend on December 16,2002. Jones permitted Tilleman to photograph his hand. Tilleman asked Jones whether he would be willing to undergo a rape kit examination. Jones replied that he would not mind and said, \u201cI\u2019m just here to do whatever you guys want.\u201d Tilleman next asked if Jones would have any problems taking a polygraph test. J ones responded that he had ADHD and an anxiety disorder that may affect the results, so he would have to talk to an attorney first, but that he was \u201cnot saying [he] wouldn\u2019t.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b320-6\">\u00b69 Tilleman asked Jones what he was wearing on December 16, 2002, and Jones replied that he was wearing black jeans and a red and black Columbia coat. Tilleman asked whether the police could look at the coat. Jones replied, \u201csure\u201d and informed Tilleman that Jones had the coat at home. Tilleman then suggested that they could go to Jones\u2019s home to \u201cgo get\u201d the coat following the interview. Tilleman stated that he was going to check on some things and left the room.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-7\">\u00b610 Captain Dave Sanders (Sanders) returned to the interview room instead of Tilleman. Sanders stated that discrepancies existed between what Jones had told Tilleman and what witness accounts reported. Jones then promptly informed Sanders that he had in fact seen Gisela the day of the homicide. Sanders asked why Jones had told Tilleman that he had not seen Gisela for several months. Jones argued that Tilleman had narrowed his inquiry to Jones\u2019s actions after 3:00 or 4:00 PM on December 16, 2002, and that Jones had visited Gisela earlier <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>that day. Sanders then employed the \u201cguilt assumption technique\u201d and informed Jones that the police \u201cinvestigation demonstrates that you were the person that did this.\u201d Jones stated that he was through talking and that \u201c[i]f you\u2019re gonna arrest me, just arrest me. I don\u2019t want to sit here and listen to you.\u201d Nonetheless, Jones kept talking and continued to deny his involvement in the crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-4\">\u00b611 Sanders asked if Jones would be willing to submit to a polygraph test, and again Jones stated that he would have to first talk to an attorney. Sanders left the room and Jones smoked a cigarette. Sanders returned and asked if Jones was willing to continue talking and if Jones still would allow the police to look at the coat Jones had been wearing on December 16, 2002. Jones responded affirmatively and stated that he had nothing to hide. Sanders asked if Jones had walked or driven to the station. Jones had walked, and Sanders said, \u201c[w]e\u2019ll just give you a ride.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b321-5\">\u00b612 Tilleman drove a squad car the mile-and-a-half from the police station to Jones\u2019s home with Jones and Sanders in the back. Jones went to his room, retrieved the coat, and brought it to the kitchen area. Tilleman and Sanders testified that Jones signed a consent form before relinquishing the coat. Jones stated that the officers first took possession of the coat and that he signed the consent form afterwards. The officers then left Jones\u2019s home.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-6\">\u00b613 Sanders telephoned Jones shortly after police returned to the station and an inspection of the coat had revealed blood stains. Sanders asked Jones if he would be willing to return to the station for a second interview. Jones agreed and appeared shortly after the phone call. Jones and Sanders returned to the interview room. The officers again videotaped the conversation. Sanders advised Jones of his <em>Miranda </em>rights for the second time that day. Jones signed a form acknowledging that he both understood his rights and that he chose to waive them. Sanders asked Jones more questions that employed the guilt assumption technique. For example, Sanders made statements repeatedly to the effect that he knew it would take courage, but that Jones should just tell Sanders what happened. Sanders also stated frequently that he knew Jones had a conscience.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-7\">\u00b614 Jones left the station and did not return until January 2, 2003, when Sanders telephoned and asked Jones again if he was willing to come in for an interview. Jones appeared at the station a third time. Sanders again provided to Jones <em>Miranda </em>warnings in the same interview room used before. Jones promptly invoked his rights. Sanders ended the interview. Law enforcement did not have further <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>contact with Jones until they arrested him on March 4, 2003, for deliberate homicide, sexual intercourse without consent, aggravated burglary, and commission of an offense with a dangerous weapon.</p>\n<p id=\"ASB\">\u00b615 Jones filed a motion to suppress the statements he made during the December 31, 2002, interviews and the coat police acquired from his home. The District Court held a two-and-a-half-day suppression hearing and received testimony from various witnesses including Tilleman, Simonich, and Jones. The court also reviewed-at least twice-the videotapes of Jones\u2019s interviews. The court concluded that Jones made the statements on December 31, 2002, voluntarily, and that law enforcement did not violate Jones\u2019s Fifth Amendment rights. The court also concluded that police did not violate Jones\u2019s Fourth Amendment rights when they seized his coat. Consequently, the District Court denied Jones\u2019s motions to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-4\">\u00b616 Following a fourteen-day trial held in January and February 2004, a jury convicted Jones of deliberate homicide, aggravated burglary, and commission of an offense with a dangerous weapon. Jones appeals the District Court\u2019s decision to deny his motions to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-5\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b322-6\">\u00b617 We engage in a twofold review of a district court\u2019s denial of a motion to suppress. <em>State v. McCollom, </em>2005 MT 61, \u00b6 7, 326 Mont. 251, \u00b6 7, 109 P.3d 215, \u00b6 7. We initially review the court\u2019s findings of fact to determine whether they are clearly erroneous. <em>McCollom, </em>\u00b6 7. A finding of fact is clearly erroneous if substantial evidence does not support it, if the district court misapprehended the effect of that evidence, or if a review of the record leaves this Court with the definite and firm conviction that the district court made a mistake. <em>McCollom, </em>\u00b6 7. We then engage in a plenary review of the conclusions of law to determine whether the district court's interpretation of the law is correct. <em>McCollom, </em>\u00b6 7. The specific question of whether a defendant has given a voluntary confession \u201c\u2018is largely a factual determination that is within the discretion of the district court.\u2019\u201d <em>State v. Hill, </em>2000 MT 308, \u00b6 37, 302 Mont. 415, \u00b6 37, 14 P.3d 1237, \u00b6 37 (quoting <em>State v. Grey, </em>274 Mont. 206, 209, 907 P.2d 951, 953 (1995)).</p>\n<p id=\"b322-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b322-8\">\u00b618 Jones argues that this Court should reverse the District Court and grant his motion to suppress statements he made to officers on December 31,2002, and suppress the coat police seized that same day. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>Jones premises Ms argument on the fact that Ms probation officer, Simomch, forced him to appear at the police station initially, and thus, any statements made thereafter were involuntary. Jones also claims that the totality of the circumstances surrounding the interview demonstrate involuntariness independent of the manner in wMch he appeared at the station. Finally, Jones contends that the police obtained information and Jones\u2019s consent regarding the coat Jones wore on December 16, 2002, only as a result of the involuntary statements and an illegal consent form, and consequently, the District Court should have suppressed evidence of the coat.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-4\">ISSUE ONE</p>\n<p id=\"b323-5\">\u00b619 Did the District Court err when it denied Jones\u2019s motion to suppress statements Jones provided to police officers during a December 31, 2002 interview?</p>\n<p id=\"b323-6\">\u00b620 Section 46-13-301(1), MCA, permits a defendant to move to suppress a confession or admission if it was given involuntarily. The statute places the burden on the state to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the confession or admission was voluntarily given. Section 46-13-301(2), MCA; <em>State v. Maestas, </em>2006 MT 101, \u00b6 17, 332 Mont. 140, \u00b6 17, 136 P.3d 514, \u00b6 17. Voluntariness depends upon the totality of the circumstances. <em>State v. Reavley, </em>2003 MT 298, \u00b6 15, 318 Mont. 150, \u00b6 15, 79 P.3d 270, \u00b6 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-7\">\u00b621 The totality of the circumstances includes the defendant\u2019s age, experience, education level, the defendant\u2019s prior experience with the criminal justice system and police interrogation, whether the accused was advised of his <em>Miranda </em>rights, and whether the police used impermissible practices to extract incriminating statements from the defendant. <em>Reavley, </em>\u00b6 15. The court should consider any physical coercion, psychological coercion, deception, use of tMeats, and direct or implied promises when determimng whether police employed impermissible practices to extract incriminating statements from the defendant. <em>State v. Hoffman, </em>2003 MT 26, \u00b6\u00b6 18-19, 314 Mont. 155, \u00b6\u00b6 18-19, 64 P.3d 1013, \u00b6\u00b6 18-19. We analyze each factor m turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-8\">\u00b622 Jones\u2019s personal attributes</p>\n<p id=\"b323-9\">\u00b623 Jones\u2019s age, experience, education level, and prior experience with the criminal justice system and police interrogation support a conclusion that Jones provided the statements to police voluntarily. Jones was 35 years old at the time of the interviews. The District Court found that Jones could read and write and that he completed the 11th grade. Although it took Mm tMee tries, Jones earned Ms GED. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>Jones has held several jobs over his life, considers himself \u201cpretty intelligent,\u201d and stated that he enjoyed reading adult mysteries.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-4\">\u00b624 Moreover, Jones had significant experience with the criminal justice system. Jones had been convicted of six felonies. Jones knew how to assert his rights, as evidenced by the fact that he declined requests by both Sanders and Tilleman to submit a polygraph test without first speaking with an attorney. Jones also knew how to terminate a police interview, as he demonstrated when he stated promptly that he would have to speak with a lawyer before answering further questions when the third interview with police commenced on January 2,2003. Further, the District Court included in its findings of fact that Tilleman interrogated Jones previously in 2001 and that Jones \u201cvoluntarily left that interview....\u201d These factors weigh in favor of the voluntary nature of the statements Jones provided on December 31, 2002.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-5\">\u00b625 <em>Miranda </em>warnings</p>\n<p id=\"b324-6\">\u00b626 The presence of timely and complete <em>Miranda </em>warnings further supports a finding of voluntariness. <em>Reavley, </em>\u00b6 15. An individual may waive his <em>Miranda </em>rights only if the waiver has been made voluntarily, knowingly, and intelligently. <em>State v. Lawrence, </em>285 Mont. 140, 148, 948 P.2d 186, 191 (1997). Officers provided <em>Miranda </em>warnings to Jones before they began asking him questions at the first interview on December 31,2002. The officers then repeated the <em>Miranda </em>warnings when the second interview began only two hours later. Jones does not argue on appeal the sufficiency of these <em>Miranda </em>warnings, or that he did not provide the waiver voluntarily, knowingly, and intelligently. Jones does argue, however, that he unequivocally invoked his right to counsel when he stated that he was \u201cthrough talking.\u201d The State responds by asserting that Jones\u2019s statements were not clear, unambiguous, and unequivocal. <em>See Reavley, </em>\u00b6 21. The State argues additionally that the officers provided <em>Miranda </em>warnings gratuitously since they never subjected Jones to \u201ccustodial interrogation.\u201d <em>See State v. Dawson, </em>1999 MT 171, \u00b6 30, 295 Mont. 212, \u00b6 30, 983 P.2d 916, \u00b6 30 (stating that <em>Miranda </em>warnings are only required if the accused is subjected to a \u201ccustodial interrogation\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b324-7\">\u00b627  We conclude that regardless of whether the police subjected Jones to a \u201ccustodial interrogation,\u201d Jones\u2019s statements that he was \u201cthrough talking\u201d do not constitute an unequivocal invocation of his right to counsel or to remain silent on the facts of this case. The District Court sits in the best position to assess the credibility of witnesses and weigh the testimony. <em>Spooner Const. &amp; Tree Serv., Inc. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number><em>v. Maner, </em>2003 MT 43, \u00b6 35, 314 Mont. 268, \u00b6 35, 66 P.3d 263, \u00b6 35. The court specifically found, after reviewing the tapes and hearing Jones\u2019s oral testimony, that \u201cthe subsequent conversation was not conducted against [Jones\u2019s] will....\u201d The videotape demonstrates that Jones said that he was \u201cthrough talking,\u201d but yet continued talking unprompted by Sanders. Substantial evidence supports the District Court\u2019s finding that Jones did not unequivocally invoke his <em>Miranda </em>rights. The presence of sufficient <em>Miranda </em>warnings and the fact that Jones did not invoke his rights further supports the State\u2019s position that Jones made his statements voluntarily. <em>See Reavley, </em>\u00b6 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-4\">\u00b628 Practices used to extract incriminating statements</p>\n<p id=\"A29\">\u00b629 Jones asserts that Sanders\u2019s use of the \u201cguilt assumption technique\u201d of questioning rendered Jones\u2019s statements involuntary. Jones does not allege, however, that Sanders ever lied to him. The State admits that Sanders employed a \u201cguilt assumption technique\u201d when he spoke with Jones on both occasions.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-5\">\u00b630 In <em>State v. Hill, </em>2000 MT 308, 302 Mont. 415, 14 P.3d 1237, we analyzed the voluntariness of Hill\u2019s statements under the totality of the circumstances test. As here, Hill argued that the police used impermissible practices to extract statements from him. We concluded that when the police merely confronted Hill with physical evidence and \u201cappealed to Hill\u2019s morality in asking for an admission but did not promise or threaten any particular treatment,\u201d that such actions did not amount to impermissible practices. <em>Hill, </em>\u00b6 45. We noted that the police did not ever mislead Hill about the evidence against him, <em>Hill, </em>\u00b6 45, and affirmed the district court\u2019s decision to admit his statements. <em>Hill, </em>\u00b6 48.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-6\">\u00b631 As in <em>Hill, </em>the police here did not ever mislead or lie to Jones. Thus, the use of the guilt assumption technique, without more, does not constitute such physical or psychological coercion, deception, threats, or promises sufficient to tip the totality of the circumstances test in Jones\u2019s favor. <em>Hill, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 45, 48.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-7\">\u00b632 Jones also claims that Simonich forced him to speak with police initially when Simonich advised Jones that Jones \u201cneeded\u201d to talk with law enforcement and informed Jones\u2019s family the day before that he needed to see Jones. Jones reasons that any statements he made after appearing at the police station are the result of the exploitation of an illegal act and should be suppressed. <em>See generally State v. Bilant, </em>2001 MT 249, \u00b6 22, 307 Mont. 113, \u00b6 22, 36 P.3d 883, \u00b6 22. Jones points also to Simonich\u2019s actions of calling the police department while Jones was in his office to set up the police interview and Simonich <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>issuing an arrest warrant for Jones based on his failure to report as further evidence of Jones\u2019s involuntary appearance at the police station.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-4\">\u00b633  Jones\u2019s mother testified that when she told her son on December 30,2002-the day before Jones met with Simonich-that the police wanted to speak with him, he responded, \u201cI\u2019ve got nothing to hide; I\u2019ll go.\u201d Simonich testified that he did not tell Jones that he had issued a warrant for Jones\u2019s arrest, and thus, did not use the arrest warrant to threaten Jones. Jones walked unescorted to the police station after leaving Simonich\u2019s office and stated repeatedly that he would talk to police because he \u201chad nothing to hide.\u201d Further, Jones returned to the police station a second time, prompted only by Sanders\u2019s phone call asking him if he was willing to come in and answer more questions. Taking into consideration these facts, and the totality of the circumstances, including Jones\u2019s personal attributes addressed in \u00b6\u00b6 23-24, we conclude that Simonich did not compel Jones to speak with police. Thus, Jones\u2019s statements did not result from an illegal act and do not warrant exclusion. <em>See Bilant, </em>\u00b6 22.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-5\">ISSUE TWO</p>\n<p id=\"b326-6\">\u00b634 Did the District Court err when it deified Jones\u2019s motion to suppress the coat the police took from Jones\u2019s home?</p>\n<p id=\"b326-7\">\u00b635 Jones argues that the coat should be excluded from evidence because the police only had knowledge of its existence due to the involuntary statements Jones made during the first two interviews. We resolved this issue above, however, when we concluded that all Jones\u2019s statements to officers were voluntary. Such statements include Jones informing the police what he was wearing on December 16, 2002, as well as his affirmative response to Tilleman\u2019s request to take a look at the coat. We deem Jones\u2019s argument on this point meritless.</p>\n<p id=\"AUd\">\u00b636 Jones asserts next that the signed form that provided consent for officers to remove the coat from his home is invalid. Although warrantless searches are per se unreasonable, knowing and voluntary consent by a citizen to a search is a recognized exception to the warrant requirement. <em>State v. Olson, </em>2002 MT 211, \u00b6 20, 311 Mont. 270, \u00b6 20, 55 P.3d 935, \u00b6 20. The prosecution carries the burden of establishing that consent to a warrantless search was freely and voluntarily given and uncontaminated by any express or implied duress or coercion. <em>Olson, </em>\u00b6 20.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-8\">\u00b637 Jones argues that the fact he did not sign the consent form until after the State already seized the coat automatically renders the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>consent invalid. Jones cites <em>Olson </em>in support of this argument. In <em>Olson, </em>officers entered the kitchen of Kathy Olson (Olson), and arrested her pursuant to a lawful arrest warrant. <em>Olson, </em>\u00b6 3. An officer conducted a search of the entire home after the arrest and discovered dangerous drugs and paraphernalia. <em>Olson, </em>\u00b6 5. Olson, in handcuffs, then provided written consent for officers to search her home. <em>Olson, </em>\u00b6 5. We considered on appeal the district court\u2019s decision to deny Olson\u2019s motion to suppress the drug evidence. <em>Olson, </em>\u00b6 2. We deemed the search a violation of Olson\u2019s Fourth Amendment rights and stated that \u201c[c]onsent to a search is not voluntary where it is given only after law enforcement already has conducted an illegal search because the consent flows directly from the unlawful intrusion.\u201d <em>Olson, </em>\u00b6 22.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-4\">\u00b638  The parties here dispute the precise timing of when Jones signed the consent form. Tilleman testified that Jones signed the consent form and relinquished his coat contemporaneously. Sanders testified that Jones relinquished the coat after signing the consent form. Testimony that Tilleman provided later comported with Sanders\u2019s testimony. More importantly, Jones\u2019s signing of a written consent form simply memorialized the oral consent that Jones provided. The only question would be whether Jones freely and voluntarily provided his oral consent before the officers seized his coat. We determined that all of Jones\u2019s statements to the police, including his affirmative response to Tilleman\u2019s request to take a look at the coat, were given freely and voluntarily. We conclude that Jones provided his oral consent before the officers took possession of his coat.</p>\n<p id=\"AEL\">\u00b639 Thus, even if Jones provided his written consent simultaneously with the officers\u2019 possession of the coat, or even after the officers took possession of the coat, such consent is valid. In contrast to <em>Olson, </em>the police here did not discover the coat pursuant to an illegal search. As discussed in \u00b6\u00b6 18-33, above, Jones provided all statements voluntarily and the police operated consistently within the parameters of Jones\u2019s constitutional rights. As there was no illegal search or evidence acquired, the precise timing of when Jones signed the written consent form does not affect our conclusion that Jones\u2019s consent for officers to seize his coat is valid. The State has met its burden of demonstrating that Jones freely and voluntarily consented to the officers\u2019 seizure of his coat. <em>See Olson, </em>\u00b6 20. Whether Jones\u2019s ensuing memorialization of his free and voluntary oral consent took place before or after the officers took possession of his coat is irrelevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-5\">\u00b640 Finally, Jones asserts that his consent to \u201clook at\u201d the coat did not also translate into consent to seize the coat. The written consent form <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>Jones signed includes language that grants the Lewistown Police Department permission to \u201cconduct a complete search of the premises\u201d and \u201cpermission to take from [the] premises\u201d anything the police deem evidence for criminal prosecution.

The State has also proven that Jones provided them with consent to seize the coat Jones wore on the day of the homicide voluntarily.
