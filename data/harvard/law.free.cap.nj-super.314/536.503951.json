Those issues are:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b569-6\">POINT I. THE PLAIN LANGUAGE OF THE CASINO AMENDMENT MEANS THAT ALL \u201cSTATE REVENUES DERIVED [] FROM\u201d THE \u201cESTABLISHMENT AND OPERATION OF [CASINO] GAMBLING ESTABLISHMENTS\u201d SHALL BE DEDICATED TO PROGRAMS FOR SENIOR CITIZENS AND THE DISABLED; THE LANGUAGE OF THE AMENDMENT IS NOT LIMITED TO REVENUES FROM A DIRECT TAX ON GAMBLING.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b569-7\">A. The Plain Language of the Casino Amendment Means that All State Revenues Derived from Casino Gambling Establishment Must be Dedicated to Senior Citizens and the Disabled.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b569-8\">B. The Interpretation of the Casino Amendment Advanced by Plaintiffs and Adopted by the Law Division Violates Established Rules of Grammar, Principles of Composition, and Well-settled Canons of Constitutional Construction.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b569-9\">POINT II. THE RELEVANT CONSTITUTIONAL AND LEGISLATIVE HISTORY OF THE CASINO AMENDMENT REINFORCES THE UNAMBIGUOUS MEANING OF ITS PLAIN LANGUAGE.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b569-10\">A. Because the Language of the Casino Amendment is Unambiguous, its Constitutional and Legislative History is Irrelevant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b570-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>B. The Law Division Overlooked the Critical Portions of the Pre-Ratification Constitutional History, Which Confirm that All State Revenues, Including the Funds At Issue Here, Were to be Dedicated to Senior Citizens and the Disabled.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b570-5\">C. The Casino Control Act\u2019s Legislative History Demonstrates that the Legislature Intended to Divert State Revenues Derived from Casino Revenues to Constitutionally Prohibited Purposes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b570-6\">D. Even if the Primary Purpose of the Casino Amendment were to Revitalize Atlantic City, This Would Not Justify the Challenged Financing Mechanisms.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b570-7\">POINT III. THE CRDA INVESTMENT ALTERNATIVE TAS SCHEME UNCONSTITUTIONALLY DIVERTS STATE REVENUES DERIVED FROM CASINO GAMBLING TO PROJECTS NOT DEDICATED TO THE BENEFIT OF SENIOR CITIZENS AND THE DISABLED.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b570-8\">A The Investment Alternative Tax Program Cannot be Justified as a \"Tax Credit\u201d for Private \u201cInvestments\u201d Because it is Essentially a Tax and, in any Event, it Generates \u201cState Revenues\u201d Which Must be Used to Benefit Senior Citizens and the Disabled.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b570-9\">1. The casino investment program is not a tax credit and, in effect, imposes a substantial tax on casino gambling revenues.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b570-10\">2. Even if, as the Law Division erroneously held, the casinos\u2019 required investments of 1.25% of their gambling revenues are private \u201cinvestments\u201d made to obtain \u201ctax credits,\u201d they still generate \u201cState revenues\u201d from casino gambling.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b570-11\">B. The CRDA Investment Alternative Tax System Cannot be Justified as a Condition on Casino Licenses; Nor is the Casino Amendment Ambiguous With Respect to Fees for Casino Licenses.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b570-12\">POINT IV. CRDA\u2019S USE OF PARKING FEES COLLECTED FROM CASINOS TO FUND REDEVELOPMENT PROJECTS VIOLATES THE CASINO AMENDMENT\u2019S DEDICATION OF ALL \"STATE REVENUES\u201d DERIVED FROM CASINOS TO THE BENEFIT OF SENIOR CITIZENS AND THE DISABLED.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b570-13\">POINT V. THE LAW DIVISION\u2019S HOLDING EFFECTIVELY NULLIFIES THE CASINO AMENDMENT\u2019S DEDICATION OF STATE REVENUES DERIVED FROM CASINO GAMBLING ESTABLISHMENTS TO PROGRAMS FOR SENIOR CITIZENS AND THE DISABLED.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b570-14\">These issues are the same issues raised below. In a well-reasoned, comprehensive twenty-nine page written opinion, Judge Williams rejected Trump\u2019s contentions, and entered the May 14, 1997 order declaring the challenged CRDA investment alternative <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>tax provisions and the parking fees provisions constitutional.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We have carefully considered the contentions of Trump and <em>amici curiae </em>on appeal in light of the entire record and applicable law.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-6\">We affirm for the reasons set forth by Judge Williams in his May 14, 1997 written opinion, which we could not write with any better clarity or rationale.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b571-14\"> Tramp does not challenge the declaration of constitutionality of the use of moneys from the sales and use tax for reimbursement to casino licensees for clean up costs under the Remediation Act.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
