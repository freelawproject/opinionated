Respondent Division of Youth &amp; Family Services (DYFS) was notified by East Park School officials and it, in turn, contacted the county prosecutor and local law enforcement. All three agencies then investigated the allegations. This <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>included interviews with Mrs. Spencer, Mr. Wallace, Arthur Edwards, students Richard Carlson and John Norman, other student witnesses, and school administrators. Mrs. Spencer denied all of the allegations against her. At the conclusion of the investigation, the county prosecutor closed his file without charging Mrs. Spencer or presenting the matter to the Grand Jury. However, in February of 1994, the investigating arm of DYFS, the Institutional Abuse Investigation Unit (IAIU), having given Mrs. Spencer the right to submit a sworn statement, which she declined to do, concluded that the allegations of sexual abuse against her had been \u201csubstantiated.\u201d Mrs. Spencer appealed that finding to us.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-6\">Subsequently, the East Park School Board filed fifteen tenure charges against Mrs. Spencer stemming from her alleged sexual abuse of Arthur Edwards, Richard Carlson and John Norman. After certifying the charges, the matter was transferred to the Office of Administrative Law (OAL) for a hearing. DYFS then moved for and was granted a stay of this appeal pending the outcome of the tenure hearing which it argued might render moot the issues raised here.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-7\">The sordid details of the allegations against Mrs. Spencer need not be related except to say that if the claims of Wallace, Edwards, Carlson and Norman had been proved, it would not only have warranted a finding of \u201csubstantiated\u201d sexual abuse, but likely would have resulted in criminal charges along with the loss of Mrs. Spencer\u2019s tenured position. However, they were not sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-8\">A three day hearing was held at which Carlson did not testify and Norman presented evidence favorable to Mrs. Spencer. Wallace, Edwards and another student, Peter Finch, testified for the school district. At the end of the hearing, the Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) dismissed all of the tenure charges against Mrs. Spencer. In so doing, she specifically rejected, as incredible, the testimony of Wallace and Edwards and the supporting testimony of Finch. Indeed, she characterized Edwards\u2019 testimony as \u201cso unbelievable that it is understandable why he fled from New <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>Jersey to avoid testifying before a grand jury.\u201d The ALJ fully accepted Mrs. Spencer\u2019s denial of the charges to which she testified in detail. Her fellow teachers\u2019 characterizations of her as a teacher above reproach was also credited by the ALJ who noted that Mrs. Spencer had worked in the school district since 1981 without ever having a discipline charge or even a poor evaluation and that her conduct was \u201cexemplary.\u201d The Commissioner of Education adopted the ALJ\u2019s decision as final and the State Board of Education affirmed upon the school district\u2019s appeal, declaring that the board \u201cfaded to meet its burden of demonstrating the truthfulness of the tenure charges.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b186-5\">Despite these conclusions having been reached after a full hearing at which the allegations of sexual abuse against Mrs. Spencer were tested in the crucible of a trial, DYFS refused to alter its determination that the charges of sexual abuse against Mrs. Spencer were substantiated.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-6\">Mrs. Spencer then sought to pursue her earlier appeal of DYFS\u2019s findings of substantiated sexual abuse. After some procedural maneuvering, DYFS proposed a settlement: if Mrs. Spencer was willing to forego her appeal, it was willing to include information about the outcome of the tenure hearing in its report maintained in its Central Registry.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-7\">Mrs. Spencer declined the offer and now proceeds with her appeal challenging the propriety of the continued inclusion of her name in DYFS\u2019s Central Registry. More particularly, Mrs. Spencer contends that the manner in which DYFS reached its conclusions denied her due process and that, in any event, DYFS is bound by the decision of the State Board of Education.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-8\">\n<em>I</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b186-9\">Statutory authority for DYFS to investigate and monitor child abuse allegations appear in N.J.S.A 9:6-8.8 to -8.98. Under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>9:6-8.10, a person who has reason to believe that a child has been subjected to child abuse is required to report that suspicion to DYFS. Upon receiving such a report, DYFS must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>take immediate action to protect the child and must report the matter to the Central Registry within 72 hours. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>9:6-8.11.

When Mrs. Spencer was accused of sexual abuse in 1994, the only opportunity she was offered to defend herself was the chance to submit a statement under oath to the IAIU. Since that time, the DYFS \u201cSupport Operations\u201d manual (Manual) has been amended to provide that when a determination has been made that an allegation of abuse has been substantiated, the perpetrator is notified that he or she has the right to request a Regional Dispositional Conference to dispute those findings, either at a hearing or at a record and document review, at the discretion of DYFS. The accused person may be represented and may bring witnesses or produce statements on his or her behalf.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-7\">According to the Manual, a written decision is to be made within sixty working days of the Regional Dispositional Conference, and must indicate whether it is final (appealable to the Appellate Division) or is subject to further DYFS or OAL review. Despite the reference to potential referral to the OAL for a hearing, DYFS adopted new regulations effective February 2,1998, stating in part that a \u201c[rjequest to change a finding in a child abuse investigation\u201d is among the requests <em>not </em>to be transmitted to the OAL. <em>See N.J.A.C. </em>10:120A-4.2(c)3. In any event, none of these procedures were available when Mrs. Spencer came under scrutiny.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-8\">\n<em>II</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b191-9\">We turn first to the question of what process is due when a citizen seeks to challenge the inclusion of his or her name on the Central Registry list of \u201csubstantiated\u201d abusers. The Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution provides that no State shall \u201cdeprive any person of life, liberty, or property, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>without due process of law.\u201d <em>U.S. Const, </em>amend. XIV, \u00a7 1. Likewise, Article I, paragraph 1 of the New Jersey Constitution, although not east in due process terms, has been held to protect \u201cValues like those encompassed by the principien of due process.\u2019 \u201d <em>Doe v. Poritz, </em>142 <em>N.J. </em>1, 99, 662 A.2d 367 (1995) (quoting <em>Greenberg v. Kimmelman, </em>99 <em>N.J. </em>552, 568, 494 A.2d 294 (1985)). The exact contours of due process cannot be defined. What it commands depends upon the specific facts presented. <em>Morrissey v. Brewer, </em>408 <em>US. </em>471, 481, 92 <em>S.Ct. </em>2593, 2600, 33 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>484, 494 (1972); <em>Cafeteria &amp; Restaurant Workers Union v. McElroy, </em>367 <em>U.S. </em>886, 895, 81 <em>S.Ct. </em>1743, 1748, 6 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>1230, 1236 (1961); <em>Hannah v. Larche, </em>363 <em>U.S. </em>420, 442, 80 <em>S.Ct. </em>1502, 1514, 4 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>1307 (1960).</p>\n<p id=\"b192-5\">In assessing whether particular administrative procedures are constitutionally sufficient, the primary question is always whether there is a protectible liberty interest at stake. <em>Nicoletta v. North Jersey Dist. Water Supply Comm\u2019n, </em>77 <em>N.J. </em>145, 154-55, 390 A.2d 90 (1978). This inquiry is the first prong of the three-pronged test enunciated in <em>Mathews v. Eldridge, </em>424 <em>U.S. </em>319, 96 <em>S.Ct. </em>893, 47 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>18 (1976) and adopted by our Supreme Court in <em>J.E. on Behalf of G.E. v. State, </em>131 <em>N.J. </em>552, 566, 622 A.2d 227 (1993) as the applicable standard in determining what procedures will assure fairness in an administrative proceeding. <em>Mathews </em>further requires us to consider</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-6\">the risk of an erroneous deprivation of such interest through the procedures used, and the probable value, if any, of additional or substitute procedural safeguards; and finally, the Government\u2019s interest, including the function involved and the fiscal and administrative burdens that the additional or substitute procedural requirement would entail.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-7\">[424 <em>U.S. </em>319 at 335-36, 96 <em>S.Ct. </em>893.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b192-8\">With respect to the issue of whether Mrs. Spencer has a protectible interest at stake here, she argues that the inclusion of her name in the Central Registry not only stigmatizes her as a child abuser but that - the incursion on her employment rights which that stigmatization causes, entitles her to due process protections. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>The cases interpreting the Fourteenth Amendment do not recognize reputational injury as a constitutionally protectible private interest and have required \u201cstigma plus\u201d to establish a constitutional deprivation. <em>Paul v. Davis, </em>424 <em>U.S. </em>693, 701, 96 <em>S.Ct. </em>1155, 1160, 47 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>405, 414 (1976). In other words, under the federal cases, mere damage to reputation, apart from impairment of some additional interest previously recognized under state law, does not trigger due process protections. <em>Sturm v. Clark, </em>835 <em>F.2d </em>1009, 1012 (3rd Cir.1987). Thus, in order to find a federal due process entitlement, a court must assess whether plaintiff established damage to his or her reputation <em>and </em>impairment of some other interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-6\">The state constitution, however, has a broader due process reach than the Fourteenth Amendment. It gives a plaintiff a protectible interest in reputation warranting due process protections \u201cwithout requiring any other tangible loss.\u201d <em>Doe, supra, </em>142 <em>N.J. </em>at 104-05, 662 A.2d 367.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-7\">Thus, a starting point in a case such as this, under both the federal and state constitutions, is the question of stigma or injury to reputational interests. <em>Doe, supra, </em>is instructive on this issue. There, the Supreme Court addressed the registration and notification procedures of Megan\u2019s Law, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:7-1-11, which not only require a sex offender to register at the local police station, but also require various public notifications of his or her relocation to an area. The level of notification depends on the convicts \u201ctier status\u201d which, in turn, is based upon the risk of re-offense.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>Doe </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>held that such notification is the kind of reputational injury which equates with stigma, warranting a due process hearing under the state constitution, and, coupled with impairment to privacy interests, under the federal constitution as well.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> We think this conclusion is equally applicable here.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-4\">To be sure, the level of revelation in <em>Doe </em>is different from what occurs in a ease such as this in which broad disclosure is not made to the general public. However, many private citizens associated with private child care agencies will, of necessity, become privy to the Central Registry information under Chapter 254. We know this because the licensure of their private agencies will depend on clearance through the Central Registry. It follows that a Central Registry rationale for non-licensure or non-renewal will be made public, albeit on a less expansive basis than under Megan\u2019s Law. However, on the other side of the balance, the subjects in <em>Doe </em>have already suffered gross impairment of their reputations, having been publicly charged, convicted and sentenced as sex offenders. They have already either been tried and found guilty beyond a reasonable doubt or have acknowledged their guilt in a public forum. Thus, their reputations have already suffered grievous besmirchment.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-5\">On the contrary, Mrs. Spencer is a teacher with an unblemished reputation not only in her school, but in the larger community. The loss of her good reputation, when the Central Registry information is shared with even a few private citizens, will irrevocably injure her previously good name. Thus, while the expansiveness of the notification here is significantly more circumscribed than in <em>Doe, </em>the reputational loss to Mrs. Spencer and others like her from the dissemination of Central Registry information is so enormous that there is parity between this and a Megan\u2019s Law ease in terms of stigma. According to <em>Doe, </em>this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>injury to good name and reputation, standing alone, is a protectible private interest under the New Jersey Constitution. <em>Doe, supra, </em>142 <em>N.J. </em>at 104-05, 662 A.2d 367.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-6\">In this case however, the injury to reputation does not stand alone. The Central Registry revelations not only injure Mrs. Spencer\u2019s good name but are inextricably intertwined with her capacity to obtain employment in a vast array of education-related jobs. Prospective child care employers are not only likely to come into possession of information about Mrs. Spencer\u2019s status as a child sex abuser but are compelled to do so and, more importantly, are prohibited from employing her under the recent statutory amendments at the risk of loss of licensure. This constitutes \u201cforeclosure\u201d from employment for which Mrs. Spencer has been trained and at which she has spent her career. The fact that she is presently employed as a tenured teacher does not detract from the power of that foreclosure. <em>See Nicoletta v. North Jersey Dist. Water Supply Comm\u2019n, supra, </em>77 <em>N.J. </em>at 160-61, 390 A.2d 90 (finding the impairment of future employability by operation of state law to be a protectible liberty interest).</p>\n<p id=\"b195-7\">Further, fact that Mrs. Spencer has not asserted an interest in changing jobs at this point is of no consequence to our analysis. The inclusion of her name in the Central Registry is a kind of Sword of Damocles poised above her head. Its clear effect is to inhibit her from even considering any life changes for fear of disclosure.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-8\">The conjunction between the defamation of Mrs. Spencer\u2019s good name and the statutory impediment to hiring her is what meets the stigma-plus test of the federal cases (i.e.), <em>Paul v. Davis, supra, </em>424 <em>U.S. </em>at 705-06, 96 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1162-63, 47 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 416 (citing <em>Cafeteria Workers v. McElroy, supra, </em>367 <em>U.S. </em>at 898, 81 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1750, 6 L.Ed.2d at 1238). Thus, Mrs. Spencer has a protectible liberty interest (the right to work) subject to due process under both the federal and state constitutions. <em>Valmonte v. Bane, </em>18 <em>F.3d </em>992, 999 (2d Cir.1994) (finding protectible liberty interest where defamation occurred precisely in conjunction with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>plaintiffs attempt to obtain employment -within child care field). <em>See also, Lee TT. v. Dowling, </em>87 <em>N.Y.2d </em>699, 664 N.E.2d 1243, 642 <em>N.Y.S.2d </em>181 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b196-4\">We note that the same analysis is applicable if stigmatization is added to the impairment of Mrs. Spencer\u2019s right to adopt or become a foster parent which also implicates weighty personal interests. <em>See Smith v. Organization of Foster Families, </em>431 <em>U.S. </em>816, 838-47, 97 <em>S.Ct. </em>2094, 2106-11, 53 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>14, 31-37 (1977); <em>Spielman v. Hildebrand, </em>873 <em>F.2d </em>1377, 1384-85 (10th Cir. 1989); <em>Thelen v. Catholic Soc. Servs., </em>691 <em>F.Supp. </em>1179 (E.D.Wis.1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b196-5\">The second <em>Mathews </em>issue is whether there is a risk of an erroneous deprivation of such interest through the DYFS administrative procedures and whether additional procedural safeguards will enhance the reliability of a \u201csubstantiated abuse\u201d determination. Put another way, is the process DYFS affords adequate to protect Mrs. Spencer\u2019s interest? If not, are there additional procedural safeguards which would suffice?</p>\n<p id=\"b196-6\">Certainly, the procedure which was actually accorded to Mrs. Spencer (only the right to submit a sworn statement) was inadequate to test the charges because the outcome depended upon a credibility evaluation of Mrs. Spencer and the witnesses against her, who she was not allowed to cross-examine. <em>High Horizons Dev. Co. v. State Dep\u2019t. of Transportation, </em>120 <em>N.J. </em>40, 575 A.2d 1360 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b196-7\">Moreover, to the extent that DYFS\u2019s revised Manual procedures specifically deny an administrative hearing to challenge a finding in a child abuse investigation <em>(N.J.AC. </em>10:120A-4.2(c)3), they suffer from the same infirmity as their predecessors \u2014 they allow a quasi-judicial determination of \u201cdisputed adjudicative facts\u201d without a quasi-judicial proceeding to undergird it. <em>High Horizons, </em>120 <em>N.J. </em>at 53, 575 A.2d 1360; <em>Cunningham v. Dep\u2019t of Civil Sen., </em>69 <em>N.J. </em>13, 21, 350 A.2d 58 (1975). One need only look to the outcome of the tenure hearing to observe the deficiencies in the DYFS procedure. Tested in a trial type hearing, Mrs. Spenc<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>er\u2019s accusers were revealed as liars and plotters. Such judgments cannot fairly be made outside a true truth-testing process. While the revised procedures have the benefit of flexibility and informality and may indeed resolve some challenges to a DYFS finding, where after exhaustion of the informal procedures, the subject maintains his or her innocence and challenges the DYFS \u201csubstantiated abuse\u201d finding as a matter of fact, a trial type proceeding is the only way to assure that a reliable judgment will be made. At the very least, it would eliminate the appearance of partiality which inexorably flows when a DYFS employee reviews a decision of that agency that abuse is substantiated. <em>J.E. on behalf of G.E., supra, </em>131 <em>N.J. </em>at 568, 622 A.2d 227. The very purpose for which the OAL was established was to foster a perception of objectivity and impartiality in an agency adjudication. <em>Unemployed-Employed Council of N.J. v. Horn, </em>85 <em>N.J. </em>646, 650, 428 A.2d 1305 (1981). That did not occur here nor will it be the case if the informal procedures contemplated in the Manual are the only method of challenging a finding of substantiated abuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-5\">Turning to the third-prong of <em>Mathews, </em>it is without question that the government has a significant interest in keeping child abusers out of the ranks of child care workers. <em>In re Allegations of Physical Abuse at Blackacre Academy, </em>304 <em>N.J.Super. </em>168, 185, 698 A.2d 1275 (App.Div.1997). However, it has or should have an equal interest in not stigmatizing the innocent and foreclosing them from employment and other opportunities. We see no government interest which will be impaired by a trial type process which subjects the allegations made to rigorous testing.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-6\">In terms of cost to the government, a trial type proceeding will plainly be more expensive and time consuming than what is presently in place and, while the number of such hearings is unpredictable, we presume it will not be insubstantial. Thus, the question of the preservation of scarce governmental resources emerges. However, financial cost alone cannot control. <em>Mathews v. Eldridge, supra, </em>424 <em>U.S. </em>at 348, 96 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 909, 47 L.Ed.2d at 41. If a trial type hearing is the only viable method of testing the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>truth, then its cost must be borne by the public in a constitutionally governed society. That is the case here. Where an accused challenges the truthfulness of her accusers and contends, <em>as a matter of fact, </em>that the charge against her is false, she must be allowed, as a function of due process, in addition to fair notice, to be present, to adduce evidence, to be represented by counsel, to confront the witnesses against her and to receive a written decision. <em>Nicoletta, supra, </em>77 <em>N.J. </em>at 167, 890 A.2d 90. In short, a trial type proceeding is the process which was due here not only out of fairness to Mrs. Spencer but as a concomitant of effective judicial review.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b198-4\">We note that another panel of this court has recently reached the same conclusion. <em>NJDYFS v. M.R., </em>314 <em>N.J.Super. </em>390, 715 A.2d 308 (App.Div.1998). While, unlike us, the members of that panel could not reach an accord on the rationale for ordering a trial type hearing in a case such as this, all three recognized that a substantial liberty interest is implicated by inclusion in the Central Registry and two of the three members of the panel explicitly identified constitutional grounds as a basis for such a hearing. <em>Id. </em>at 425, 715 A.2d 390 (Skillman and Eichen, concurring).</p>\n<p id=\"b198-5\">\n<em>Ill</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b198-6\">This brings us to the question of what kind of a hearing should be held under the odd complex of facts before us. Recall that Mrs. Spencer already had a full trial type hearing in the Depart<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>ment of Education and was cleared of all the charges against her. Based on that hearing she sought to preclude DYFS from maintaining her name in the Central Registry. We specifically addressed such circumstances in <em>Blackacre Academy </em>where we noted that we \u201cassume[d] that if the Department [of Education] conducts a hearing and renders a final decision based on a complete record, the IAIU would reevaluate its findings of abuse and, if appropriate, remove appellant\u2019s names from the Central Registry based on that decision.\u201d <em>Blackacre Academy, supra, </em>304 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 189, 698 A.2d 1275. Thus, if DYFS had before it the same evidence as was considered by the ALJ at the tenure hearing, we would likely have bound it to the tenure result based upon principles of administrative comity and fairness to Mrs. Spencer.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-5\">However, as DYFS points out in its brief, in reaching its conclusion it relied on much evidence which, for some reason, was not produced at the tenure hearing (for example, the testimony of Richard Carlson, a tape recorded conversation between Mrs. Spencer and Arthur Edwards and the testimony of the school administrators). Mrs. Spencer argues that DYFS should nonetheless be bound by the outcome of the tenure hearing based on the concept of \u201cjudicial estoppel\u201d because it requested us to stay this appeal pending the outcome of the tenure case which it claimed \u201cmight\u201d moot the issue here. Mrs. Spencer views this as an acknowledgement of the preclusive effect of the tenure hearing and characterizes DYFS\u2019s present stance as a change in its prior position. Not so. We see it only as a recognition that if the tenure charges had been sustained, DYFS\u2019s conclusion that the sexual abuse charges against Mrs. Spencer had been substantiated would be unassailable. It was not a concomitant concession that if the tenure charges were dismissed on less evidence than DYFS possessed, that agency would be barred from maintaining its earlier finding of substantiated abuse. In sum, we disagree with Mrs. Spencer that the outcome of the tenure case disposes of this case as well. Because DYFS possesses evidence which the East Park School Board was unable or unwilling to produce during the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>tenure case, there is no warrant for application of a doctrine of preclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-4\">Obviously, the better course would have been for DYFS to seek to participate in the tenure matter to assure that its interests were protected. <em>See N.J.A.C. </em>6:24-1.7; <em>N.J.A.C. </em>1:1-16.1 to -16.6. Having failed to do so, we see no reason why Mrs. Spencer should be required at this point to undergo the rigors of a totally new hearing including all of the discredited witnesses against her. The most economical and just disposition of this case demands that it be sent back to the ALJ who presided over the tenure charges. DYFS can present any additional evidence it has to support the charges against Mrs. Spencer and she, in turn, may challenge the evidence, cross-examine witnesses and present evidence of her own on the subject. Thereafter, the ALJ may recommend to DYFS whether the allegations of substantiated abuse against Mrs. Spencer should remain in the Central Registry based upon a preponderance of the evidence standard. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>52:14B-10(c). <em>In re Polk, </em>90 <em>N.J. </em>550, 560-61, 449 A 2d 7 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b200-5\">Reversed and remanded for proceedings consonant with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b187-18\"> Pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>9:6-8.40a, which became effective April 7, 1997, when allegations are determined to be unfounded, expungement of the information is required.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b187-19\"> These include parents, other caretakers and the victim. <em>See Blackacre Academy, supra, </em>304 <em>N.J.Super. </em>168, 698 A.2d 1275.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b193-8\"> (1) If risk of re-offense is low, law enforcement agencies likely to encounter the person registered shall be notified;</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-9\">(2) If risk of re-offense is moderate, organizations in the community including schools, religious and youth organizations shall be notified in accordance with the Attorney General's Guidelines, in addition to the notice required by paragraph (1) of this subsection;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-10\">(3) If risk of re-offense is high, the public shall be notified through means in accordance with the Attorney General's Guidelines designed to reach members of the public likely to encounter the person registered, in addition to the notice required by paragraphs (l) and (2) of this subsection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b194-6\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number><em>[N.J.S.A. </em>2C:7-8c.]</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b194-7\"> <em>Doe </em>also held the doctrine of fundamental fairness to be a separate basis for such a hearing. 142 <em>N.J. </em>at 107-09, 662 A.2d 367.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b198-7\"> Despite DYFS's arguments to the contrary, nothing in <em>Blackacre Academy, supra, </em>suggests a different result. There we were faced with a challenge to a substantiated abuse finding by DYFS in which appellants did not argue that DYFS should have held an evidentiary hearing and did not seek a remand for a hearing. Moreover, that case arose prior to the enactment of the New Jersey statute requiring child care employers seeking licensure to resort to the Central Registry. <em>Valmonte </em>was distinguished in <em>Blackacre Academy </em>by the absence of such a statute. Further, we specifically contemplated that an aggrieved party who suffered adverse consequences by virtue of disclosure of the Central Registry information would receive due process by way of a trial type hearing in the agency which proposed to use the information against him or her.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
