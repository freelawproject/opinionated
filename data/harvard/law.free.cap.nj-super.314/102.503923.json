South Plainfield, </em>305 <em>N.J.Super. </em>151, 701 A.2d 1281 (App.Div.1997), having contained a dissent by Judge D\u2019Annunzio, was appealed as-of-right to the Supreme Court. Upon motion for summary reversal, the Court, by order dated April 12, 1998, denied the motion but \u201csummarily remanded to the Appellate Division for reconsideration in the light of <em>Smart SMR v. Fairlawn [Fair Lawn], </em>152 <em>N.J. </em>309, 704 A.2d 1271 (1908 [1998]).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b136-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>Upon reconsideration, we have carefully reviewed the arguments set forth in the parties\u2019 remand briefs and have reconsidered the entire record in light of <em>Smart SMR v. Fair Lawn, supra. </em>In our previous opinion, we noted that \u201cthe public interest at stake\u201d under <em>Sica v. Board of Adjustment of Township of Wall, </em>127 <em>N.J. </em>152, 165-66, 603 A.2d 30 (1992) was clearly identified. <em>New Brunswick Tel, supra, </em>305 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 168, 701 A.2d 1281. In this regard, we accepted the Board\u2019s evaluation, which was well grounded in the testimony presented at the hearings, that \u201cthe proposed use is significantly less compelling than other types of beneficial uses____\u201d <em>Id. </em>We concluded that the Board properly balanced the positive and negative criteria to determine whether the variance could be granted without substantial detriment to the public good. <em>Id. </em>at 169, 701 A.2d 1281.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-6\">Thus, we are satisfied that our decision in the within matter fully comports with the law as declared by the Supreme Court in <em>Smart SMR v. Fair Lawn, supra. </em>Therefore, we reaffirm our decision reversing the Law Division\u2019s determination that the Board acted arbitrary, capricious, and unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-7\">Our reversal of the Law Division\u2019s judgment reversing the Board stands by majority vote of this court.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b136-8\">D\u2019ANNUNZIO, J.A.D.</author>\n<p id=\"AU2\">(dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b136-9\">This is a supplement to my original dissent occasioned by the Supreme Court\u2019s remand for reconsideration in light of <em>Smart SMR v. Fair Lawn Bd. of Adjustment, </em>152 <em>N.J. </em>309, 704 A.2d 1271 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b136-10\">Although <em>Smart </em>refused to recognize a mobile communication facility as an inherently beneficial use \u201cat this time,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 329, 704 A.2d 1271, the Court recognized that Smart\u2019s telecommunications facility \u201cserves the general welfare and satisfies the positive criteria.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 332, 704 A.2d 1271. The facts in the present case are similar to those in <em>Smart </em>and I conclude, therefore, that Comcast\u2019s proposed use in the present case also satisfies the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>positive criteria. I do not understand the majority opinion to contest that finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-6\">In <em>Smart, </em>the Supreme Court concluded \u201cthat Smart has established that the requested variance may be granted without substantial detriment to the public good.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 332, 704 A.2d 1271. In doing so the Court engaged in the following analysis:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-7\">The proposed use, moreover, will not substantially impair Fair Lawn\u2019s zone plan or zoning ordinance. Compelling evidence supports the conclusion that the Fair Lawn site is particularly suited for the proposed use. Additionally, any detrimental effects resulting from the grant of the variance will be minimal. Nothing in the record permits a contrary conclusion. The proposed use will produce no noise, vibrations, smoke, dust, odors, heat, or glare. It would require infrequent maintenance and little or no municipal services such as water, sewer, police or fire.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-8\">On the record before us, the proposed ESMR monopole would not substantially impair Fair Lawn\u2019s zone plan. Although the Fair Lawn site abuts a residential zone, the site is still zoned for industrial use and is surrounded on three sides by commercial and industrial uses. Because Smart and NYNEX offered to take down NYNEX\u2019s existing 90-foot monopole and to co-locate their antennas on one 140-foot monopole, the proposed use would result in merely a 50-foot increase in height. That increase would not substantially alter the Fair Lawn skyline. <em>See Nynex, supra, </em>276 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 612, 648 A.2d 724 (finding addition of 8 to 10 feet of antenna on top of existing 130-foot water tower was \u201caesthetically inconsequential and minimal intensification of the nonconformity\u201d); <em>Kingwood, supra, </em>272 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 509, 640 A.2d 356 (holding that replacement of 75-foot tower with 197-foot tower would impose, at most, minimal intrusion on surrounding community).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-9\"><em>[Id. </em>at 333, 704 A.2d 1271.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b137-10\">The Court in this analysis of the <em>Smart </em>facts could have been talking about Comcast\u2019s application; they are that similar. As I pointed out in my initial dissent, Comcast\u2019s \u201cproposed location of the monopole in [South Plainfield\u2019s] most permissive industrial zone is the most important fact in this case.\u201d <em>New Brunswick Cellular Tel. Co., supra, </em>305 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 175, 701 A.2d 1281 (D\u2019Annunzio, J. dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b137-11\">The Court in <em>Smart </em>also concluded that the real estate agent's testimony regarding an alleged adverse impact on property values was a \u201cnet opinion.\u201d 152 <em>N.J. </em>at 334, 704 A.2d 1271. Similarly, in <em>New Brunswick Cellular Tel. Co., supra, </em>I concluded that the objectors\u2019 planning expert\u2019s testimony \u201cthat desirable manufacturing and office users would not seek to locate in the M-3 zone if the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>pole is installed\u201d was a \u201cstartling statement\u201d unsupported by \u201cempirical evidence.\u201d 305 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 175, 701 A.2d 1281.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-4\">Once again, I would affirm the Law Division\u2019s reversal of the Board of Adjustment\u2019s denial of Comcast\u2019s variance application.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
