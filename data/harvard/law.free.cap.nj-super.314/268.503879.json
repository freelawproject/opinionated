Plaintiffs appeal the dismissal of their 42 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1983 federal claim and some of their state law claims. Defendants cross appeal from the denial of their application for counsel fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-11\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-12\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-13\">On December 23, 1992, John A. Ferraro (\u201cplaintiff\u2019) and his wife filed a five-count complaint in the Law Division against the City of Long Branch, its mayor, Adam Schneider, and various other town officials. Count one was subtitled \u201cCivil Rights <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>Claim \u2014 42 U.S.C., Section 1983,\u201d count two \u201cTortious Interference with pursuit of lawful employment,\u201d count three \u201cViolation of N.J.A.C. 4A:3-3.4,\u201d and count four \u201cViolation of N.J.A.C. 4A:2-5.1.\u201d These allegations resulted from plaintiffs municipal work assignments outside the scope of his civil service job description in alleged retaliation for his political conduct. Plaintiffs wife asserted a <em>per quod </em>claim in the fifth count. Because of the federal claim, defendants removed the case to the United States District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-6\">On August 23, 1993, the District Court dismissed the federal claim and the Third Circuit affirmed on May 10,1994. <em>Ferraro v. City of Long Branch, 23 F.</em>3d 803 (3d Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b305-7\">An amended complaint was filed on August 15, 1994 after the remand to the Law Division. However, plaintiffs were granted leave to file a second amended complaint in order to incorporate references to federal law into count four which had alleged unlawful retaliation for plaintiffs protected political activities. On July 21,1995, plaintiffs were granted leave to further amend count four to reflect a \u00a7 1983 claim grounded in violations of the First Amendment. However, all counts of the complaint were ultimately dismissed against all defendants. Also dismissed was a consolidated action<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> by plaintiff against Schneider asserting various state and federal claims, including a defamation count based on the release \u201c[o]n or about August 24, 1993,\u201d of a report prepared in defense of plaintiffs workers\u2019 compensation petition, as well as defendants\u2019 counterclaim for unearned benefits paid to plaintiff. Defendants\u2019 motion for counsel fees was also denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-8\">Plaintiffs appeal, and defendants cross appeal from the denial of counsel fees.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b306-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>B.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-4\">For purposes of \u00f3ur review of the dismissals, we must accept the facts as alleged by plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-5\">In 1979, plaintiff became the Long Branch Superintendent of Parks and Public Property, a classified position. In 1982, Long Branch\u2019s then-Mayor appointed plaintiff Director of the Department of Public Works, a non-classified position he held for eight years. Plaintiff apparently took a leave of absence from his civil service position during his tenure as Director of Public Works until July 1,1990.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-6\">In 1989, defendant Schneider was elected to the City Council. During his tenure as a Council member, Schneider publicly criticized Ferraro\u2019s performance as Director of Public Works. In 1990, Schneider became Mayor. Plaintiff had actively supported Schneider\u2019s opponent and actively campaigned on the opponent\u2019s behalf. During the campaign, plaintiff was told that Schneider would \u201cget rid of\u2019 him.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-7\">In July 1990, after Schneider took office, plaintiff, who returned to serve in his classified position, was informed that he was no longer permitted to take his city car home. Shortly thereafter, the new Acting City Administrator directed that everyone in the Department of Public Works \u201cexcept John Ferraro\u201d could receive \u201covertime.\u201d The Administrator also directed the Acting Director of Public Works to see to it that plaintiff \u201cworks.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b306-8\">Sometime after July 9, 1990, when defendant Anthony Critelli became Director of Public Works, plaintiffs work \u201ccrew\u201d was reduced, and he was \u201cleft ... with one or two men to maintain the parks.\u201d According to plaintiff, the duties of the Superintendent \u201care almost entirely administrative and supervisory in nature.\u201d However, because he no longer had a sufficient amount of workers to assist him, plaintiff, who was responsible for the maintenance of 400 to 500 acres, was forced to engage in such \u201cmanual labor\u201d as cutting grass and picking up litter. Because of the stress he was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>experiencing, plaintiff became physically ill and took extensive sick leave and vacation time in the last half of 1990.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-6\">When Ferraro returned to work, he was again directed to perform physical labor which included shoveling sand and picking up debris. He was also forced, at Critelli\u2019s direction, to take orders from individuals with \u201clesser positions\u201d who would have otherwise been his subordinates.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-7\">Early in the morning of December 28, 1990, plaintiff was directed to perform snow removal around City Hall following a heavy snow storm. Although the city owned a snow blower, plaintiff and his co-worker were instructed to shovel the snow by hand. While working on the steps of City Hall, plaintiff collapsed and fell to the ground. Rescue workers resuscitated plaintiff and transported him to Monmouth Medical Center. In their subsequent report, the emergency workers noted that, upon their arrival, plaintiff was \u201cunresponsive\u201d and had no pulse.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-8\">The incident was the subject of an article which appeared the next day in the <em>Asbury Park Press. </em>Plaintiff was described as having \u201csuffered a massive heart attack\u201d in which \u201c[h]is heart had stopped, and he ceased breathing,\u201d but that after \u201ccardiopulmonary resuscitation\u201d was performed and \u201can artificial airway [was inserted] into his throat,\u201d \u201cFerraro\u2019s heart and lungs began working again.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b307-9\">Plaintiff never returned to work, although we are told that he did not officially retire until July 1995. A medical report, prepared for the City on or about March 5, 1991, concluded that it was \u201cclear\u201d that plaintiffs \u201ccardiac arrest was precipitated and as such is related to the episode of shoveling snow.\u201d Plaintiff was advised by the City Health Care Administrator that his case was \u201ccompensable\u201d and that he was entitled to all medical and temporary disability benefits \u201cuntil ... medically proven to return to work.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b307-10\">Following plaintiffs collapse, plaintiff and his wife had several conversations with Benedict John Forest, a reporter with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number><em>Atlanticville, </em>a weekly publication based in Long Branch, regarding plaintiffs medical problems and the treatment he allegedly had been receiving from defendants. Plaintiff told Forest he was \u201csuffering from a severe health problem\u201d and that \u201chis heart attack was brought on by harrassment [sic] during his employment for the City of Long Branch.\u201d According to Forest, plaintiff \u201cindicated that Mayor Adam Schneider and Congressman Frank Pallone had a vendetta against him and [ ] were out to get him.\u201d Independently, the following article, authored by Wayne Parry, appeared in the <em>Asbury Park Press </em>on April 3,1991:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b308-5\">The city\u2019s former public works director, who suffered a massive heart attack while shoveling snow from City Hall steps in December, is seeking $5 million from the city, alleging he repeatedly was ordered to perform manual labor that was not part of his job.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b308-6\">John A, Ferraro, 50, of Poole Avenue, states that Mayor Adam Schneider, Public Works Director Anthony Critelli Jr. and other city employees caused his injury, alleging he was ordered to shovel the snow and perform other tasks to \u201chumiliate\u201d him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b308-7\">Ferraro\u2019s lawyer, Ronald S. Gasiorowski of Middletown Township, filed a notice of claim last Thursday with the city clerk\u2019s office. The notice informs the city a lawsuit is to be filed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b308-8\">Schneider said no one in city government did anything to harm Ferraro, and he dismissed the planned lawsuit as \u201ccompletely ridiculous.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b308-9\">Ferraro and Schneider have sparred publicly and privately since Schneider was a city councilman in 1989 over the maintenance of Hoey Avenue Park, Ferraro\u2019s work schedule, overtime pay and other issues.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b308-10\">Ferraro, who served as public works director during former Mayor Philip D. Huhn\u2019s eight-year tenure, resigned the post shortly before Schneider won the mayoral election last May, and returned to his previous civil service post as superintendent of parks and public property.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b308-11\">Ferraro said the Schneider administration had engaged in a series of actions \u201cto put me down in front of the men and let them know I\u2019m no longer in charge, to put me in my place.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b308-12\">His superintendent\u2019s job involved supervision, and should not have included strenuous manual labor, Ferraro said.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b308-13\">Last Dec. 28, Ferraro was ordered to shovel snow from City Hall steps the morning after a storm dumped as much as 7 inches on parts of Monmouth County. While cleaning the steps, Ferraro was stricken with a massive heart attack.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b308-14\">He tumbled down a flight of brick steps; his heart stopped and he ceased breathing for several minutes. He was revived by the city\u2019s former fire chief, a police patrolman and two paramedics, all of whom happened to be nearby.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b309-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>That morning, Ferraro said, he reported to work a half-hour early and was told to drive a snowplow. Ferraro recalled stating that because he had a sinus headache, had taken some medication and had not driven such a large truck in several years, he shouldn\u2019t operate the plow. A foreman then told him to shovel snow at City Hall, Ferraro said.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b309-6\">He attributed the heart attack to a combination of physical exertion and anger he felt over being ordered to perform the task.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b309-7\">\u201cI went down there, and it bothered me,\u201d he said. \u201cAs I was shoveling the snow, the exertion of it combined with being mad, I got a sharp pain in my chest. I grabbed for the railing and went tumbling down the steps.\u201d Ferraro said he does not remember anything after that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b309-8\">Former Fire Chief Arthur Van Pelt, a member of the Long Branch First Aid Squad, and Police Patrolman Peter Schaus responded to a report that someone had fallen on the steps. As two MONOC paramedics arrived about two minutes later, Ferraro\u2019s heart stopped, and he stopped breathing. Van Pelt, Schaus and the paramedics brought Ferraro inside City Hail where they struggled to revive him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b309-9\">Van Pelt and Schaus performed eardio-pulmonary resuscitation on Ferraro, while the paramedics inserted an artificial airway into his throat. Shortly afterward, Ferraro\u2019s heart and lungs began working again.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b309-10\">Schneider said Ferraro\u2019s claims are without merit.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b309-11\">\u201cNobody ever did anything to harm Mr. Ferraro, and I\u2019m sure that\u2019s exactly what will come out as this matter progresses,\u201d the mayor said. \u201cIt\u2019s unfortunate that he\u2019s chosen this method of attack. If the notion is to embarrass us, I think it\u2019s unfortunate.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b309-12\">On or about August 24, 1993, Schneider provided Forest with a copy of a medical report, dated July 3, 1992, which had been prepared for the City in anticipation of plaintiffs workers\u2019 compensation case.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In this new report, the same doctor who prepared the first evaluation rejected the notion that plaintiffs collapse resulted from a cardiac ailment. He now reported that plaintiff had a \u201cnormal electrocardiogram\u201d and expressed the opinion that all of plaintiffs problems stemmed from a \u201cpsychotic depression\u201d which had left plaintiff in a \u201cdesperate\u201d and \u201calmost vegetative\u201d state. The report concluded that plaintiff \u201chas no coronary artery disease but ... a psychotic depression\u201d and was \u201cin desperate need of admission for psychiatric purposes\u201d to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>\u201cbrain wash him out of his cardiac neurosis.\u201d Upon receipt of this report, Forest \u201cchose not to write a story about the medical report\u201d or the City\u2019s position.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-4\">In a letter addressed to the \u201cConcerned Resident[s]\u201d of Long Branch which was released during Schneider\u2019s 1994 re-election campaign, the Mayor wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b310-5\">I have tried very hard to run a clean, honest and frugal government, which puts the interests of the city above politics and personalities. That is why I feel badly that on one occasion I got carried away in my defense of what I thought was the public interest.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b310-6\">John Ferrara\u2019s [sic] $5 million lawsuit faces us with a major increase in insurance costs when we are trying vigorously to hold the line on taxes. Although the first ruling by the court favored the city\u2019s contention of a frivolous lawsuit, I made the mistake of taking matters into my own hands by inappropriately releasing to the press information which supported our case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b310-7\">I was angry at a reporter who insisted Mr. Ferrara\u2019s [sic] medical condition was a fact when that condition had not been proven in court. Initially I was too ashamed of my mistake to admit I had sent the information. But I quickly realized the best thing to do was to take my lumps for acting thoughtlessly. And so within a few days of my mistake I admitted it publicly.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b310-8\">Still I did not believe my opponents on the City Council would be so merciless and unscrupulous in their attacks on me. They have tried to make this one indiscretion into some kind of Watergate affair.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b310-9\">Did I make a mistake by incorrectly releasing information to the press and waiting a few days before owning up?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b310-10\">Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b310-11\">Did I make a mistake trying to defend the city against what I believe is a frivolous, but potentially damaging lawsuit?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b310-12\">No. ...</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b310-13\">In his workers\u2019 compensation case, plaintiff produced proofs that he suffered an \u201cacute cardiac arrest secondary to severe coronary artery spasm -with impaired cognition for which he has a permanent cardiac disability of 100% of total.\u201d Dr. Rowland D. Goodman II\u2019s June 21, 1994 evaluation also reported that \u201cthe onset of this condition was initiated and triggered as a result of ... [plaintiffs] emotional stress and ... physical exertion ... [w]hen this patient engaged in shoveling snow____\u201d The December 14, 1994 report of the City\u2019s psychiatrist concluded that plaintiff suffered \u201cmajor depression post trauma\u201d rendering him \u201ctotally and permanently disabled on a psychiatric basis ... which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>... is in fact related to his employment.\u201d The doctor stated his belief that the work related \u201cstress combined with the excess work in a cold environment probably did cause the cardiac incident.\u201d That report concluded that plaintiffs \u201creaction of depression since that time probably relates to both the cardiac incident and the psychiatric stress that he was under during ... his last days at work\u201d and that \u201cit [was] impossible to tease out one from the other in regard to his present psychiatric disability.\u201d Plaintiffs workers\u2019 compensation action was eventually settled on May 8, 1997.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-7\">Plaintiff argues that count four of his second amended complaint, which asserted both a First Amendment \u00a7 1983 claim and related state law claims, was improperly dismissed.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> He asserts that the trial judge improperly concluded both that his First Amendment claim was precluded by the Third Circuit opinion and that, if it was not, the new \u201ctheory of liability\u201d was barred by the statute of limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-8\">In her May 15, 1996 letter opinion, the Law Division judge decided to dismiss \u201call federal claims, including those under the First Amendment of the United States Constitution and Section <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>1983, because of the precedential effect of the Third Circuit opinion decided May 10,1994.\u201d However, plaintiff notes that \u201c[n]o federal statutory or constitutional claim was addressed in the federal courts other than the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendment <em>property </em>and <em>due process claims of the original First Count.\u201d </em>In fact, the Third Circuit noted that no First Amendment claim was raised.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>See Ferraro v. City of Long Branch, supra, </em>23 F.3d at 806, n. 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-4\">Plaintiffs are technically correct that the first count of the original complaint did not refer to political retaliation, the fourth count did not then refer to the First Amendment, and the Third Circuit\u2019s decision focused only on the question of whether plaintiff had adequately stated a claim of deprivation of a constitutionally protected property right. <em>Id. </em>at 805. Affirming the District Court, the Third Circuit repeatedly noted that plaintiff had failed to state a claim inasmuch as he was not directly or constructively discharged from his position and, accordingly, he was not deprived of a protected property interest under the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s due process clause. <em>Id. </em>at 805-07.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>Thus, the Third Circuit did not rule on a First Amendment claim and only addressed the federal claim embodied in the first count of the complaint which had been dismissed by the District Court. However, the first count of plaintiffs\u2019 complaint which was the basis of the removal to the federal court was captioned \u201cCivil Rights Claim \u2014 42 U.S.C., Section 1983\u201d and alleged, among other things:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b313-6\">5. The defendants, Schneider, Crltelli, Council members and other officials, agents, servants and employees acted intentionally, wilfully and knowingly under the color of the statutes, ordinances, rules and customs of the City of Long Branch and the State of New Jersey to deprive the plaintiff John A. Ferraro of his rights, privileges and immunities secured by the laws and regulations governing municipal employment in the classified service in the State of New Jersey and more specifically deprived him of the rights and privileges of a person holding the title of Superintendent of Parks and Public Property and subjected the plaintiff to the deprivation of a legally protected property right in his employment secured by the Constitution and laws of the United States and the State of New Jersey without due process of law in violation of those Constitutions and the statutes in such case made and provided.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b313-7\">6. As a result of the intentional, willful and knowing denial of rights and privileges of the plaintiff, the defendants have shown a reckless and callous disregard of a legally protected property right under the Constitution and laws of the United States and the State of New [Jjersey and are liable to the plaintiff for compensatory and punitive damages pursuant to 42 U.S.C., section 1983 and attorneys fees pursuant to 42 U.S.C., section 1988.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b313-8\">Under these circumstances, we hold that plaintiffs section 1983 claim was disposed of in the federal courts and cannot be relitigated in the State courts of New Jersey. The facts on which plaintiff based his federal claim \u2014 the political retaliation \u2014 were all known both before the original complaint was filed and before the action was removed to and considered in federal court.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>Cf </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number><em>Watkins v. Resorts Int\u2019l Hotel &amp; Casino, Inc., </em>124 <em>N.J. </em>398, 410-12, 591 A.2d 592 (1991) (state civil rights claim not barred by dismissal of federal claims in federal court based on insufficient service of process and lack of standing); <em>Velasquez v. Franz, </em>123 <em>N.J. </em>498, 505-07, 589 A.2d 143 (1991) (no preclusion of state court action because federal disposition was not on the merits). <em>See also Mortgagelinq Corp. v. Commonwealth Land Title Ins. Co., </em>142 <em>N.J. </em>336, 346-48, 662 A.2d 536 (1995). The section 1983 claim was before the federal court and adjudicated there on the merits. A dismissal for failure to state a claim, as the Third Circuit upheld here, is a disposition on the merits. <em>Velasquez v. Franz, supra, </em>123 <em>N.J. </em>at 507-08, 589 A.2d 143. Plaintiff could not bifurcate his federal claims or the theories on which he advanced his \u00a7 1983 claim. Only the state claims were remanded to the state court; no federal claims were reserved. <em>Cf. Manhattan Woods Golf Club, Inc. v. Arai, </em>312 <em>N.J.Super. </em>573, 711 A.2d 1367 (App.Div.1998) (New Jersey state court can consider claim expressly reserved in federal bankruptcy action). <em>See also Velasquez, supra, </em>123 <em>N.J. </em>at 508-09, 589 A.2d 143. Thus, the federal claims were properly dismissed by the Law Division.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-5\">Plaintiff argues that the Law Division nevertheless improperly dismissed the first count of his second amended complaint.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Ac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>cording to plaintiff, under New Jersey law he possessed a property right in the duties and authority ordinarily associated with the position of Superintendent of Parks and Public Property, and consequently, defendants\u2019 actions in depriving him of his rightful authority constituted a violation of his State due process rights. His argument is that \u201cthe plaintiff has a vested right in the duties, status, authority and other rights inherent to his classified civil service title which right is entitled to protection under the laws of the State of New Jersey.\u201d While plaintiff emphasizes his rights under civil service legislation and implementing regulations, he appears also to be asserting a constitutional claim under <em>N.J. Const. </em>Art. I, 111 which assures \u201c[a]ll persons ... certain natural and unalienable rights, among which are those of enjoying and defending life and liberty, [and] of acquiring, possessing and protecting property....\u201d <em>See also Nicoletta v. North Jersey Dist. Water Supply Comm\u2019n, </em>77 <em>N.J. </em>145, 159-63, 390 A.2d 90 (1978) (due process right to hearing before public employee can be terminated with finality).</p>\n<p id=\"b315-6\">In dismissing the first count, the Law Division concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b315-7\">The first count of the second amended complaint alleges that defendants violated plaintiffs due process rights, fundamental fairness and related principles and doctrines of state law. Plaintiff has failed to demonstrate any deprivation of a property or liberty interest as required to pursue a due process claim. No case cited by plaintiff or discovered by the court supports such finding. In the absence of such an interest, plaintiff cannot prevail on Count One. Therefore, I will dismiss the first count of plaintiffs second amended complaint.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b315-8\">We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-9\">In <em>Scancarella v. Department of Civil Serv., </em>24 <em>N.J.Super. </em>65, 70, 93 A.2d 637 (App.Div.1952), we observed that \u201c[t]he design of civil service legislation was to secure tenure during good behavior for those employees who come within its scope ... and to give protection against <em>dismissal and other types of discrimination </em>to those holding positions which the Legislature placed in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>classified service.\u201d (Emphasis added). The \u201cother types of discrimination\u201d recognized by the <em>Scancarella </em>court included \u201creduction in rank, status or compensation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 69, 93 A.2d 637. Here, plaintiff was neither discharged nor suffered a reduction in pay, and his rank and status within the civil service hierarchy were unaffected by defendants\u2019 actions. Thus, he suffered no deprivation of a property interest. <em>See Ferraro v.

He relies on <em>Edelstein v. City of Asbury Park, </em>12 <em>N.J.Super. </em>509, 511, 79 A.2d 860 (App.Div.1951), in which plaintiff, a taxpayer in the City of Asbury Park, appealed from the dismissal of his action which sought to have a recently enacted local ordinance set aside. The ordinance, which created the office of Superintendent of Police and vested the holder of that office with complete authority over the Chief of Police and police department, had been passed upon the recommendation of the City Manager, following a determination that the Chief of Police was incompetent. <em>Id. </em>at 511-13, 79 A.2d 860. Although the city was aware that the current Chief could not be discharged or demoted without the filing of formal charges and a hearing, no charges were ever filed. <em>Id. </em>at 512, 79 A.2d 860.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-5\">We concluded that the ordinance was \u201cintended to and did in substance, although perhaps not in form,\u201d displace the current Chief as the functioning Chief of the Asbury Park Police Department, <em>id. </em>at 513, 79 A.2d 860, and that the trial court improperly dismissed the case because there was a possibility that the city\u2019s actions \u201cconstitute[d] improper action warranting judicial intervention.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 513-14, 79 A.2d 860. We further noted that \u201cthe fact that the chief retained his salary and his nominal title while being stripped of his authority as chief was not of sufficient <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>significance\u201d to automatically absolve the city of any wrongdoing. <em>Id. </em>at 514, 79 A.2d 860. Accordingly, we remanded for further proceedings, including presentation of a defense, if the matter was not moot. But we did not suggest that the Chief of Police had any right to money damages. In fact, we noted that the Chief had already \u201cvoluntarily resigned.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b317-6\">In <em>Pillsbury v.

After Pillsbury refused to turn over all his files to the new counsel and to submit his resignation, the Board instructed him to release the records to the Board\u2019s director for reassignment and to cease attending public meetings. <em>Id. </em>at 530, 337 A.2d 632.

We rejected the Board\u2019s position that it, as Pillsbury\u2019s client, had the right to discharge Pillsbury at any time pursuant to the rules adopted by the Supreme Court regarding the attorney-client relationship. <em>Ibid.; see Pillsbury, supra, </em>133 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 533-36, 337 A.2d 632.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In affirming the trial judge\u2019s opinion, we further noted that while the Board might <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>appoint special counsel for specific legal matters, it could not use this authority \u201cas a guise to obscure the real intention to strip the duly and regularly appointed counsel of his powers and responsibilities as counsel.\u201d <em>Pillsbury, supra, </em>133 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 537, 337 A.2d 632.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-4\"><em>Edelstein </em>merely passed upon the validity of an ordinance, 12 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 514, 79 A.2d 860, and <em>Pillsbury </em>held that the Board of Freeholders could not deprive an individual of his statutory position before the expiration of his term, 133 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 537-38, 337 A.2d 632. This case is quite different as there was no endeavor to discharge plaintiff or terminate his classified position.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-5\">Pillsbury would have lost his job, title and compensation, 133 <em>N.J.Super., supra, </em>at 530, 337 A.2d 632, but here, plaintiff did not. Rather, he essentially contends that because he occupied a supervisory position, he should not have been ordered to perform the work of non-supervisory personnel within his downsized department. But courts should not be in the business of micromanaging work crews, personnel decisions and job assignments, <em>see Ferraro v. City of Long Branch, supra, </em>23 <em>F.</em>3d at 806-07, and we do not read <em>N.J. Const. </em>Art. I, 111, to give greater protection than the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments in this respect. Thus, as plaintiff \u201cconcedes [that defendants] did not change his job title or modify his salary and benefits,\u201d <em>Ferraro, supra, </em>23 F.3d at 806, he cannot collect damages under New Jersey law. Moreover, we do not read the New Jersey statutes and rules which protect civil servants and classified public employees to suggest that their breach may give rise to a suit for money damages as opposed to administrative relief. <em>Cf.

The same can be said with respect to the promotion of the policy behind the Long Branch ordinance.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-5\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-6\">We agree with plaintiff that exhaustion of administrative remedies is not a prerequisite for an action under Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act (\u201cADA\u201d), 42 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 12101 to \u00a7 12213. <em>See Noland v.

In order to establish \u201cactual malice,\u201d a plaintiff must show that the defamatory statement was made \u201c \u201cwith knowledge that it was false or with reckless disregard of whether it was false or not,\u2019 \u201d and animosity between the parties involved is irrelevant. <em>Burke, </em>97 <em>N.J. </em>at 475, 479 A.2d 393 (quoting <em>New York Times Co. v.

If a matter is \u201cwithin the sphere of public interest,\u201d facts related to the subject that would otherwise be deemed private may be considered newsworthy, and therefore publishable, and that is a question of law for the court to decide. <em>Id. </em>at 301, 537 A.2d 284.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-6\">The issue of responsibility for plaintiffs collapse and subsequent disability had been rendered newsworthy by virtue of both plaintiffs status as a public official and the possibility of the City of Long Branch being held responsible for damages, as well as the publication of several articles on the subject, including at least one in which plaintiff publicly aired his grievances against the City. Hence, while Schneider\u2019s release of the medical report may have been inappropriate (as he himself admitted), it was newsworthy and therefore publishable.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-7\">VI.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-8\">We do not believe the remaining issues on plaintiffs\u2019 appeal require comment. <em>R. </em>2:ll-3(e)(l)(A)(E).</p>\n<p id=\"b323-9\">VII.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-10\">We also reject defendants\u2019 cross-appeal.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b323-11\">While a prevailing plaintiff in a \u00a7 1983 action generally obtains counsel fees absent special circumstances, <em>see Stockton v.

Defendants also contend that because the remainder of plaintiffs claims were either utterly baseless factually or not legally cognizable, as indicated by their eventual dismissal, a fee award was clearly warranted. According to defendants, once it became apparent that plaintiff had no facts to support his allegations and that his proposed amendments to his complaint merely consisted of efforts to reintroduce federal claims which had already been dismissed, plaintiff was under an obligation to discontinue his lawsuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-9\">We agree with the trial court that counsel fees in connection with the federal action should have been filed in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>federal court. The federal action cannot be considered merely a component of the present state court action. We also conclude that the trial judge, in any event, did not abuse her discretion in denying counsel fees.
