The only point <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>urged as ground for reversal is, that the court erred in overruling certain objections of defendant\u2019s counsel to questions asked by plaintiff\u2019s counsel of defendant in her cross-examination. The action was brought to recover upon a promissory note made and delivered by defendant to plaintiff. The defendant pleaded payment. The evidence offered in support of such plea was, that shortly after the execution of the note, the plaintiff accompanied defendant on a European trip, traveling from place to place abroad with her from early in June, 1897, until May, 1898. That defendant on the trip paid the traveling expenses, hotel bills, and other expenses of plaintiff, which amounted to more than the principal and interest due upon the note. There is no issue as to the fact that plaintiff did take said trip with defendant, and that defendant paid her expenses and hotel bills, amounting to more than the amount due upon the note. The plaintiff contended, and the court found, that she took the trip as the guest of the defendant, and with the understanding that defendant was to pay all her expenses. The main issue, then, before the trial court was as to the truth of these contentions. If defendant invited the plaintiff as her guest to accompany her on the trip, with the understanding, either express or implied, that defendant would pay all her expenses, the defendant cannot now charge plaintiff with such expenses as an offset to the note. The court below had to determine this issue of fact from the evidence. The court, during the cross-examination of the defendant, overruled several objections of her counsel to questions asked of her by plaintiff\u2019s counsel. The questions were asked for the purpose of showing\u2014and the answers of defendant did show\u2014that at various times, and in fact for the most of the time between May, 1896, and March, 1897, up to the time of the departure for Europe, the plaintiff was the guest of defendant at the Hotel Del Monte, Hotel San Rafael, Howell Mountain, and other places, and that defendant paid all the hotel bills and expenses of plaintiff at these times. In cross-examination the trial judge is vested with much discretion, and it is only in cases where such discretion is abused that this court will interfere. <em>(Sandell </em>v. <em>Sherman, </em>107 Cal. 391; <em>Grimbley </em>v. <em>Harrold, </em>125 Cal. 24.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>) The evi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>\u25a0dence tended to exhibit the relative situation of the parties towards each other, their friendly relation, and the circumstances surrounding'them, at the time and immediately prior to the time they started on their tour. Defendant claims that, although she obtained the plaintiff\u2019s money\u2014all she had\u2014and gave her note for it, that, as a matter of fact, it was only in her hands, as plaintiff\u2019s banker, for the purpose of defraying the plaintiff\u2019s traveling expenses. If plaintiff at the time was, and many times before had been, the guest of defendant, it 'seems much more probable that she was such guest on the 'trip abroad. If defendant had on prior occasions invited plaintiff to expensive hotels and paid all bills \"for her, it renders the probability mush greater that she contemplated doing so during the time in controversy. It shows the relations and friendship .that existed between the parties.\" It certainly was -competent on plaintiff\u2019s theory to prove that she and defendant were friends of long standing. It is much more probable -that defendant would have offered to pay the expenses of a friend as \u00e1 companion to her on her journeys than if plaintiff had' been a stranger. The question was to determine the intent and understanding of the parties. It is much like a question that often arises in courts as to whether or not services performed by a relative or friend while living as a member of the family are to be paid for. We understand the rule in such -cases is to allow the relation of the parties,, the conduct, the -treatment while in the family, and. the fact that similar ser\u25a0vices have'been performed without compensation to be given \u2022in evidence. The eye of the judge is directed to the mirror \u2022that reflects and throws light upon each act and circumstance, while with his ear he listens .to each one\u2019s tale of woe. While .the evidence was not strictly relevant to the fact in issue, it Was relevant to the facts which were relevant to the fact in \u2022issue. It was for the purpose of showing facts which illustrated and rendered more probable the plaintiff\u2019s theory as \u2022to the fact in issue. Defendant testified that' she was very much in debt at the time she borrowed the money; that plaintiff said to her: \u201cI will put it in your hands 'as an investment.\u201d The defendant, notwithstanding this statement, was allowed to testify .to. the amount of traveling expenses and hotel expenses incurred by her for plaintiff, in order to. show <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>that plaintiff was indebted to her. The plaintiff was properly allowed to show that defendant, on many other occasions, had invited plaintiff to visit her, and had .paid her hotel bills and traveling expenses. In <em>Grimbley </em>v. <em>Harrold, </em>125 Cal. 24,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the plaintiff proved a contract with her uncle, by the' terms of which she was to pay all dues and assessments, and that she should be the beneficiary of \u00e1 certificate of life insurance in a society called the -Ancient Order of United Workmen. The plaintiff was allowed, under defendant\u2019s objection, to prove that she bestowed care on her uncle during his last illness. The court held the evidence competent, and said: \u2018\u2018But the evidence tended to exhibit the relative situation of the parties toward each other, and hence to make more probable the matter which was averred.\u201d In a case where a person had dealings with the cashier of a bank, and the issue was whether such dealings were had with him in his individual or his official capacity, evidence of prior similar dealings was held admissible. <em>(L\u2019Herbette </em>v. <em>Pittsfield National Bank, </em>162 Mass. 137.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>) In <em>Turner </em>v. <em>Luning, </em>105 Cal. 124, plaintiff claimed the right to recover upon a promissory note for fifteen hundred dollars which he had bought for three hundred dollars. Defendant denied that he sold the note to plaintiff, or that he received three hundred dollars, or any other sum of money for it. Evidence was held competent to prove that defendant had sold other notes about the same time at a great discount.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-5\">It follows that the judgment must be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-6\">Gray, C., and Haynes, C., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-7\">For the reasons given in the foregoing opinion the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-8\">McFarland, J., Henshaw, J., Lorigan, J.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b367-5\"> 73 Am.
