The patent to Houghton was granted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>in 1863, and at the expiration of the state\u2019s franchise, in 1877, Powell, then remaining in possession, obtained another twenty-years\u2019 franchise to himself from the city. This franchise was inconsistent with a title then remaining in Houghton, and was constructive notice that Powell claimed the title to the wharf as against Houghton, and any subsequent purchaser was chargeable with notice that Houghton\u2019s title had passed to Powell. <em>(Smith </em>v. <em>Yule, </em>31 Cal. 180;<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Killey </em>v. <em>Wilson, </em>33 Cal. 691.)

Ency. of Law, 1st ed., p. 456, note 1; Devlin on Deeds, 806.) The permission to use a wharf free of tolls is a valuable consideration. (6 Am. &amp; Eng.

The board of trustees are also made defendants, but for convenience of expression, the city will be referred to, <em>eo nomine, </em>as though the sole defendant. The judgment in the lower court was adverse to the plaintiff, who appeals from the same, and from an order denying his motion for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-8\">The plaintiff and two associates are the successors of one Powell, to whom, by an ordinance of the city, of date July 10, 1877, there was granted a franchise to erect and maintain the wharf in question for the term of twenty years. The wharf was accordingly constructed and maintained by Powell, to whose rights the plaintiff and his associates succeeded September 21, 1895. On the expiration of the -term the city refused to renew the franchise, and, without tendering to the plain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>tiff or his associates any compensation for the present wharf structure, commenced proceedings to remove the same, and to erect in its place another wharf, which are the proceedings sought to be enjoined.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-4\">In the original complaint there is no allegation as to the ownership of the land on which the wharf stands, except the allegation that when the suit was commenced the city was not the owner or entitled to the possession of it. But it is alleged in a supplemental pleading that the plaintiff and his associates have become the owners of the land since the commencement of the suit; and in support of these allegations there was introduced in evidence by the plaintiff: (1) A patent from the state of date April 3, 1863, issued to one Houghton, purporting to grant to him the land described as 1 \u2018 Survey No. 3, State Tide Lands, \u2019 \u2019 etc., including the land in question; (2) a deed of date June 11,1867, from Houghton to Powell, and the heirs of one Likens, purporting to convey to the grantees the land covered by the wharf; and (3) mesne conveyances from Powell to the plaintiff and his associates (the deed to plaintiff being of date June 30, 1898), purporting to convey to them the land in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-5\">But the deed from Houghton to Powell was not recorded until June 9, 1898, and on February 18th of that year, it is found, Houghton, by deed of that date, recorded the same month, \u201cfor a valuable consideration,\u201d conveyed the land under the wharf, and other land, to the city, which took without notice of the unrecorded deed; and hence, assuming the facts to be as found, and assuming also the validity of the patent, the title to the land, and with it the wharf structure, became vested in the city. (Civ. Code, sec. 660.)</p>\n<p id=\"b205-6\">It is indeed objected by the appellant that the findings as to consideration and as to notice are not justified by the evidence; but the objections, we think, are untenable. As to the latter, the specific claim of the appellant is, that by his possession under the franchise the city was affected with notice. But the possession of the appellant, had apparently terminated before 'the making and recording of the deed to the city; and even while it' endured it was \u20181 consistent with the title appearing of record,\u201d and therefore referable to it, and hence not of a character \u201cto put the purchaser on inquiry.\u201d <em>(Schumacher </em>v. <em>Truman, </em>134 Cal. 430, and cases cited, p. 432.) As to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>consideration of the deed, it is admitted there was none, \u201cunless the reservation set out in said deed be deemed a valuable consideration/ \u2019 But this, we think, was the case. The passage in the deed referred to is, \u201cThis conveyance reserves to the parties of the first part and their assigns free access or right of way to or from any lots adjoining either line of said Virginia Street, to and over any wharf which may at any time be upon said street,\u201d which, in the technical sense of the term, is a \u201creservation,\u201d as distinguished from an \u201cexception,\u201d and is therefore in the nature of a grant to the grantor. (Bouvier\u2019s Law Dictionary, word \u201cReservation,\u201d and also \u201cException\u201d; <em>Seymour </em>v. <em>Courtney, </em>5 Burr. 2817; 5 Am. &amp; Eng. Eney. of Law, 1st ed., note 1.) Its effect is to grant to the parties of the first part in the deed and their assigns \u201caccess or right of way\u201d from any of the lots described to and over the wharf to the water-front, and from the water-front to the lots,\u2014a privilege not only of value to the beneficiaries personally and as owners of land abutting on the street, but also a detriment to the city, which otherwise would have been empowered by its charter to impose tolls on the parties of the first part and their assigns, as upon others using the wharf. (Stats. 1899, see. 25, subd. 35.) It therefore constituted a valuable consideration for\" the deed. (Anson on Contracts, 68; <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Pike, </em>9 Cow. 69, cited in Devlin on Deeds, see. 806.) It comes also within the description of a valuable consideration, as being \u201csuch as money or the like,\u201d given in the cases cited by the appellant <em>(Clark </em>v. <em>Troy, </em>20 Cal. 219; <em>Frey </em>v. <em>Clifford, </em>44 Cal. 335); and also within the definition given of \u201ca good consideration\u201d in section 1605 of the Civil Code, where the general definition is applied to the ease of a promise, and where the term \u201ca good consideration\u201d is not used in the ancient technical sense, \u201cas that of blood or natural affection\u201d <em>(Clark </em>v. <em>Troy, </em>20 Cal. 219), but as equivalent to the term \u201ca valuable consideration.\u201d Nor can the objection be sustained that the easement granted does not extend to the portion of the wharf extending below the old line of low water, but is limited to the portion of the wharf within the latter line, which, it is claimed, is only \u201can\" approach to the wharf.\u201d It extends obviously to the whole wharf. Nor is the objection more tenable that the benefit granted was one to which Houghton, in common with the public generally, was- lawfully entitled, and the detriment suffered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>by the city one it was lawfully bound to suffer. Whether the reservation extended to the free right of \u201cwharfage and dockage\u201d need not be inquired. It at least exempts the beneficiaries from \u201ctolls,\u201d which the city, by section 35 of this charter, would otherwise have the right to impose.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-5\">It follows that the plaintiff has no cause of action against the city. But in thus holding, we are not to be understood as affirming the validity of the Houghton patent, as our conclusion must be the same, whether it be valid or the contrary. In the former case the title to the land is in the city; in the latter, it is in the state, and the city, by its charter, is authorized to erect and maintain the wharf.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-6\">We advise that the judgment and order appealed from be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-7\">Haynes, C., and Gray, C., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-8\">For the reasons given in the foregoing opinion the judgment and order appealed from are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-9\">McFarland, J., Henshaw, J., Lorigan, J.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
