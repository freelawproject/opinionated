Const. art. IX, \u00a7 7 (2003),\n   <em>\n    amended by\n   </em>\n   2003 N.C. Sess. Laws ch. 423, \u00a7 1 (effective Jan. 1, 2005).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The present appeal requires us to determine whether this constitutional provision applies to penalties collected by the City of High Point under its red light camera program.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On motions for summary judgment, the superior court ruled that the Constitution was applicable to the program and that the ordinance failed to dispose of red light camera penalties in accordance with constitutional mandate, and ordered High Point to pay ninety percent of the penalties collected under the program to the Guilford County Board of Education. For the reasons set forth herein, we uphold these rulings of the superior court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The present case also raises an issue as to whether High Point should have been ordered to pay post-judgment interest. We conclude that the general statutory provision governing post-judgment interest is not applicable to the City and vacate the portion of the superior court's order requiring High Point to pay interest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <em>\n    Background\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Since the enactment of Chapter 583, Section 2 of the 1949 North Carolina Session\n   Laws, section 20-158 of our General Statutes have prohibited motorists from entering an intersection while a stoplight is emitting a red light.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 20-158(b)(2) (2003),\n   <em>\n    amended by\n   </em>\n   2004 N.C. Sess. Laws ch. 141, \u00a7\u00a7 1, 2 and ch. 172, \u00a7 2. Under the General Statutes, failure to stop for a red stoplight is an infraction, and a violator \"may be ordered to pay a penalty of not more than one hundred dollars.\" N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 20-176(a), (b) (2005).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Beginning in 1997, certain specified municipalities were legislatively imbued with the authority to \"adopt ordinances for the civil enforcement of [section] 20-158 [of the General Statutes] by means of a traffic control photographic system,\" or as such systems are referred to in the vernacular, \"red light cameras.\" N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 160A-300.1(c) (2005),\n   <em>\n    enacted by\n   </em>\n   1997 N.C. Sess.

The enabling legislation, section 160A-300.1(c), provides that, \"[n]otwithstanding the provisions of [section] 20-176 [of the General Statutes], in the event that a municipality adopts [a red light camera] ordinance . . ., a violation of [section] 20-158 at a location at which a traffic control photographic system is in operation shall not be an infraction.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 160A-300.1(c). The statute further requires red light camera ordinances to contain language to the following effect:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   (2) A violation detected by a traffic control photographic system shall be deemed a noncriminal violation for which a civil penalty of fifty dollars ($50.00) shall be assessed, and for which no points authorized by [section] 20-16(c) [of the General Statutes] shall be assigned to the owner or driver of the vehicle nor insurance points as authorized by [section] 58-36-65 [of the General Statutes].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   (3) The owner of the vehicle shall be issued a citation which shall clearly state the manner in which the violation may be challenged, and the owner shall comply with the directions on the citation. The citation shall be processed by officials or agents of the municipality and shall be forwarded by personal service or first-class mail to the address given on the motor vehicle registration. If the owner fails to pay the civil penalty or to respond to the citation within the time period specified on the citation, the owner shall have waived the right to contest responsibility for the violation, and shall be subject to a civil penalty not to exceed one hundred dollars ($100.00). The municipality may establish procedures for the collection of these penalties and may enforce the penalties by civil action in the nature of debt.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   (4) The municipality shall institute a non-judicial administrative hearing to review objections to citations or penalties issued or assessed under this section.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 160A-300.1(c)(2), (3), (4). In 1999, the City of High Point was granted the authority to enact a red light camera ordinance.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 160A-300.1(d),\n   <em>\n    as amended by\n   </em>\n   1999 N.C. Sess. Laws ch. 181, \u00a7 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Shortly thereafter, High Point enacted section 10-1-306 of its Code of Ordinances, which provided as follows:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   (a)\n   <em>\n    Administration.\n   </em>\n   The City of High Point shall implement a system for capturing traffic control violations, as defined under [section] 20-158 [of the General Statutes], with a traffic control photographic system that will use the photographic images as prima facie evidence of the traffic violations and will authorize the High Point Department of Transportation or an agent of the department to issue civil citations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The City of High Point Department of Transportation shall administer the traffic control photographic program and shall maintain a list of system locations where traffic control photographic systems are installed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Any citation for a violation for [section] 20-158 [of the General Statutes] or other traffic violation, issued by a duly authorized law enforcement officer at a system location shall be treated, pursuant to [section] 20-176 [of the General Statutes], as an infraction so long as the system photographic\n   images are not used as prima facie evidence of the violation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The citation shall clearly state the manner in which the violation may be reviewed. The citation shall be processed by officials or agents of the city and shall be forwarded by personal service or first-class mail to the owner's address as given on the motor vehicle registration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   (b)\n   <em>\n    Offense\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   (1) It shall be unlawful for a vehicle to cross the stop line at a system location when the traffic signal for that vehicle's direction of travel is emitting a steady red light, or for a vehicle to violate any other traffic regulation specified in [section] 20-158 [of the General Statutes].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   (2) The owner of a vehicle shall be responsible for a violation under this section, unless the owner can furnish evidence that the vehicle was in the care, custody or control of another person at the time of the violation. . . .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   * * * *\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   (c)\n   <em>\n    Penalty.\n   </em>\n   Any violation of this section shall be deemed a noncriminal violation for which a civil penalty of $50.00 shall be assessed, and for which no points authorized by [section] 20-16(c) [of the General Statutes] shall be assigned to the owner or driver of the vehicle, nor insurance points as authorized by [section] 58-36[-]65 [of the General Statutes]. Failure to pay the civil penalty or to respond to the citation within 21 days shall constitute a waiver of the right to contest responsibility for the violation and shall subject the owner to a civil penalty not to exceed $100.00. The city shall establish procedures for the collection of the civil penalties and shall enforce the penalties by a civil action in the nature of a debt.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   (d)\n   <em>\n    Nonjudicial administrative hearing.\n   </em>\n   The City of High Point Department of Transportation shall establish an administrati[ve] process to review objections to citations or penalties issued or assessed. A notice requesting a hearing to review objections shall be filed within 21 days after notification of the violation. An individual desiring a nonjudicial hearing must post a bond in the amount of $50.00 before a hearing will be scheduled. The determination of the hearing officer will be final.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   HIGH POINT, N.C., CODE OF ORDINANCES \u00a7 10-1-306 (2001),\n   <em>\n    amended by\n   </em>\n   HIGH POINT, N.C., ORDINANCE No. 01-68, \u00a7 1 (Aug. 16, 2001), No. 6071/03-45, \u00a7 1 (Aug. 21, 2003), and No. 6074/03-48, \u00a7 1 (Sept. 2, 2003).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   In implementing this ordinance, High Point entered into a contract with Peek Traffic, Inc., pursuant to which Peek was to install red light cameras at several of the City's intersections. Peek also agreed to,\n   <em>\n    inter alia,\n   </em>\n   collect the photographs from the cameras and prepare potential citations. Peek entered into a subcontract with Electronic Data Systems Corporation (EDS) pursuant to which EDS was to perform some of Peek's contractual duties to High Point.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Under its contract with Peek, EDS reviewed the red light camera photographs for potential violations. EDS eliminated from consideration for a citation those photographs which demonstrated an obvious legitimate explanation for the motorist's behavior, such as a lawful right turn at a red light, and those photographs which failed to contain a legible image of the offending vehicle's license plate. For the remaining photographs, EDS identified the registered owner of the pictured vehicle and printed a \"candidate\" citation for the pictured violation. A police officer employed by the City of High Point then reviewed each candidate citation and made a determination as to whether an official citation should be issued. EDS then mailed the approved citations to the owners of the vehicles appearing in the corresponding photographs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The citation received by each unhappy motorist contained,\n   <em>\n    inter alia,\n   </em>\n   reproductions of the images captured by the red light camera, a record of the date and time that the images were taken, and the following statement: \"The civil penalty for this violation is $50.00. . . . Failure to pay the civil penalty or respond to the citation within 21 days of notification will result in the automatic waiver of right to appeal and will result in an additional late penalty of $50.00.\" The back of the citation contained the following notice:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   If you wish to contest this citation, fill out the Appeal section and return this form along with a deposit of $50.00, which shall constitute a bond. Once your appeal is received, you will be contacted so that an administrative hearing can be scheduled. An independent hearing officer will hear your appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   . . . If your citation is dismissed, your deposit will be refunded.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   A space for registering the reasons for an appeal was included.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Appeals from red light camera citations were heard by one of two High Point University professors who agreed to serve as appeal hearing officers. These appeal hearing officers were compensated at a rate of $25.00 per hearing, regardless of the decision rendered.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   High Point placed the money collected in connection with the red light camera citations in the \"Red Light Camera Campaign Penalties Fund,\" which is separate from the City's general operating fund. Pursuant to its contractual obligations, High Point dispersed seventy percent of the revenue in the Red Light Camera Campaign Penalties Fund to pay Peek for the installation and operation of the red light camera system; this expense amounted to $35 of each $50 ticket. Monies from the fund were also used to compensate the appeal hearing officers, and a small amount was expended from the Fund to educate the public about the red light camera system. The remaining balance, if any, was dedicated for traffic safety programs and for safety-related transportation improvements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <em>\n    The Facts and Procedural History of the Present Case\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   On 4 April 2001, a red light camera recorded Henry H. Shavitz failing to observe a red stoplight at the intersection of Main and College Streets in High Point. On 3 May 2001, a citation was issued to Shavitz in accordance with High Point's red light camera ordinance. Shavitz refused to pay the $50.00 fine in the prescribed twenty-one day period, and on 25 May 2001, he was issued a citation for $100.00, which included the cost of the red light violation and the penalty for failing to timely pay or appeal the original citation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Shavitz responded by filing a lawsuit in Guilford County Superior Court against the City of High Point, its mayor, city manager, and city council members, the Guilford County Board of Education, Peek, and EDS. Shavitz' complaint sought declarations that section 160A-300.1 of the General Statutes and section 10-1-306 of the High Point City Code of Ordinances were repugnant to the North Carolina Constitution; that the contracts between High Point, Peek and EDS were illegal; that the penalties collected constituted an illegal tax; and that statutory section 160A-300.1 and ordinance section 10-1-306 and the contracts entered into between High Point, Peek, and EDS established a scheme which violated the equal protection and due process guarantees of the United States Constitution and the \"law of the land\" clause of the North Carolina Constitution. Shavitz' complaint further sought, as an alternative basis for relief in the event that the superior court found that the red light camera program was valid, a declaration that Article IX, Section 7 of the North Carolina Constitution required High Point to pay the clear proceeds of all past and present fines collected by the red light camera program to the Guilford County Board of Education.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   The action was removed to the Federal District Court for the Middle District of North Carolina. While the action was pending in federal court, the Guilford County Board of Education filed an answer to Shavitz' lawsuit and a request for declaratory judgment that it was entitled to the clear proceeds of the red light camera fines pursuant to Article IX, Section 7 of the North Carolina Constitution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   On cross motions for summary judgment filed by a number of the parties, the district court ruled against Shavitz on all federal-law claims and certain state law claims and remanded to state court all but one of Shavitz' state-law claims.\n   <em>\n    Shavitz v. City of High Point,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9101200\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/270/702/\">\n    270 F.Supp.2d 702\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (M.D.N.C.2003),\n   <em>\n    vacated in part sub nom., Shavitz v.

The court retained Shavitz' claim under Article IX, Section 7 of the North\n   Carolina Constitution and ruled that High Point did not owe the clear proceeds of its red light camera penalties to the Guilford County Board of Education.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 729-30. On an appeal by the Board of Education, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit issued an unpublished,\n   <em>\n    per curiam\n   </em>\n   opinion vacating the district court's ruling as to Article IX, Section 7 and instructing the district court to remand that claim to state court.\n   <em>\n    Shavitz v.

There remained, however, a dispute between High Point and the Board of Education concerning whether the Board was entitled to the clear proceeds of the penalties collected by the red light camera program.\n   <em>\n    See Jennette Fruit v. Seafare Corp.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8526153\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc-app/75/478/#p483\">\n    75 N.C.App. 478\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 483,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=331%20S.E.2d%20305\">\n    331 S.E.2d 305\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 308 (1985) (\"[U]nless a crossclaim is dependent upon plaintiff's original claim (as would be,\n   <em>\n    e.g.,\n   </em>\n   a crossclaim for indemnity or contribution) or is purely defensive, a plaintiff's dismissal of its claims against all defendants does not require dismissal of crossclaims properly filed in the same action.\"). Both High Point and the Board of Education moved for summary judgment on this issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   The superior court ruled that Article IX, Section 7 of the North Carolina Constitution was applicable to High Point's red light camera program and that it required the clear proceeds of the penalties collected thereunder to be paid the Board of Education. Thereafter, the superior court entered a judgment awarding to the School Board\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   90% of all amounts collected by or on behalf of the City from the inception of [the red light camera program] through its termination, such amount to include $1,453,703.40 through December 21, 2004, and 90% of all amounts collected thereafter, less any amounts returned by or on behalf of the City to drivers who successfully appeal their penalties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   High Point was further ordered to pay post-judgment interest pursuant to section 24-5 of the General Statutes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   High Point now appeals to this Court, contending that the superior court erred by (1) ruling that Article IX, Section 7 of the North Carolina Constitution applies to its red light camera program, (2) miscalculating the amount of the clear proceeds to be paid to the Board under this provision if it is applicable, and (3) awarding post-judgment interest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   <em>\n    The Standard of Review\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Summary judgment is proper \"if the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that any party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\" N.C.

Specifically, section 160A-300.1 delegates enforcement to municipalities, and decriminalizes violations of section 20-158(b)(2) by providing that \"[n]otwithstanding the provisions of [section] 20-176, in the event that a municipality adopts [a red light camera] ordinance. . ., a violation of [section] 20-158 shall not be an infraction\" and by making red light camera violations \"noncriminal violation[s] for which a civil penalty of fifty dollars ($50.00) shall be assessed.\" N.C.

This assertion is nonsensical, as these expenditures clearly constitute enforcement costs rather than collection costs. The payments to Peek accomplish enforcement of the traffic laws in much the same way as paying police officers for traditional enforcement, and the payment of the appeal hearing officers is comparable to the payment of judges who preside over traditional infraction hearings. As the costs of employing police and judges are not deducted to determine the clear proceeds of a penalty,\n   <em>\n    ante,\n   </em>\n   ___ N.C.App. at ___, 630 S.E.2d at 15-16 (citing\n   <em>\n    Cauble IV's\n   </em>\n   discussion of enforcement costs versus collection costs), High Point may not deduct its analogous enforcement costs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   High Point also argues that the General Assembly did not intend for the ten percent formula of section 115C-437 to apply in determining the clear proceeds of red light camera penalties. As the City notes, the statute which enables red light cameras in High Point and approximately two dozen other cities does not state that the clear proceeds of the camera program must go to the schools, but the statutes which specifically authorize red light cameras in the City of Concord and in the County of Wake do direct that the clear proceeds of those local programs be paid to the schools.\n   <em>\n    Contrast\n   </em>\n   N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 160A-300.1\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   2001 N.C. Sess. Laws ch. 286, \u00a7\u00a7 3, 4,\n   <em>\n    as amended by\n   </em>\n   2003 N.C. Sess. Laws ch. 380, \u00a7\u00a7 3, 4. Further, High Point notes that the Concord and Wake County statutes provide a different definition for the phrase \"clear proceeds,\" to wit: \"the\n   funds remaining after paying for the lease, lease purchase, or purchase of the traffic control photographic system; paying a contractor for operating the system; and paying any administrative costs incurred by the municipality related to the use of the system.\" 2001 N.C. Sess. Laws ch. 286, \u00a7\u00a7 3, 4,\n   <em>\n    as amended by\n   </em>\n   2003 N.C. Sess. Laws ch. 380, \u00a7\u00a7 3, 4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   However, we are unpersuaded that the laws which, by their terms, are limited in applicability to the red light camera programs in Concord and Wake have any bearing on the definition of \"clear proceeds\" by which High Point is bound. As indicated in section I of our discussion, the clear proceeds of the penalties collected by High Point's red light camera program must be paid to the Guilford County Board of Education. Further, the General Assembly's 2001 enactment concerning Concord and Wake makes it clear that the Legislature feels it has the authority to clarify the meaning of clear proceeds in the context of red light camera programs. As the General Assembly has not made a new definition applicable to High Point, we must conclude that the City is bound by the definition of clear proceeds set forth in section 115C-437 of the General Statutes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   High Point finally argues that, even if applicable, section 115C-437 cannot limit its collection costs to ten percent of the amount of the penalties collected because this limitation runs afoul of the flexible test for determining the costs of collection established by the Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    Cauble IV.\n   </em>\n   The\n   <em>\n    Cauble IV\n   </em>\n   decision, which predated the enactment of section 115C-437, affirmed this Court's reversal of a superior court order disallowing Asheville's attempt to withhold penalty collection costs from the local school board.\n   <em>\n    Cauble IV,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4687691\" index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc/314/598/#p604\">\n    314 N.C. at 605-06\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=336%20S.E.2d%2059\">\n    336 S.E.2d at 64\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

We conclude that the statutory limitation on a municipality's ability to withhold collection costs, as codified by section 115C-437 of the General Statutes, comports with the language of Article IX, Section 7.

Thus, absent a legislative provision to the contrary, a municipality should not be ordered to pay interest pursuant to a general interest statute where the issue which has been litigated involves a governmental function of the municipality.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   In the present case, High Point was sued for enforcing state and municipal traffic laws and for its management of the proceeds collected for violations. These functions were governmental such that, under the foregoing analysis, the general post-judgment interest provisions of section 24-5 of the General Statutes did not apply to any judgment against the City.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   Accordingly, the superior court erred by ordering High Point to pay post-judgment interest in this case.

However, the trial court erred by ordering High Point to pay post-judgment interest on the award.
