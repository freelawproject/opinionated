Gen.Stat. \u00a7 97-29 (2005) for the period from 18 July 2000 through 5 April 2001 and compensation for partial permanent disability under N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 97-31 (2005). Plaintiff Walter Lee Ramsey, Jr. was assaulted while staying at a motel in Richmond, Virginia in order to work for defendant Southern Industrial Constructors, Incorporated (\"Southern\") on a project in Petersburg, Virginia. The issue on appeal is whether the Industrial Commission erred in determining that this assault arose out of and in the course of plaintiff's employment with Southern. We hold that it did not err. We further hold, with respect to plaintiff's appeal, that the record contains competent evidence to support the Commission's conclusion that plaintiff failed to meet his burden of proving continuing total disability. Accordingly, we affirm the Commission's opinion and award.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <em>\n    Facts\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   At the time of the hearing in the Industrial Commission, plaintiff was 58 years old. He had graduated from high school and had taken some college courses at Campbell University. Although plaintiff suffered from a speech impediment and had substantial limitation of motion in his left shoulder due to a congenital condition, he had been able to work for 20 years as a surveyor and for approximately 12 years as an electrician.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   For about one and a half years, plaintiff worked as a journeyman electrician on projects for Southern. Southern's home office was located in Raleigh, North Carolina, but the company sent plaintiff - who lived in Kinston, North Carolina - to various sites, including Columbia, South Carolina; Little\n   Rock, Arkansas; Durham, North Carolina; and Petersburg, Virginia. The length of plaintiff's assignments at these job sites varied from weeks to months. Sometimes, plaintiff was laid off after completing a particular assignment, only to be rehired a short time later to work at another Southern job site. Plaintiff typically received a $25.00 per day per diem while working at the various job sites.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In early July 2000, Ken Parker, the Southern supervisor for a project in Petersburg, Virginia, asked his project manager in Raleigh for additional workers. At this time, plaintiff was working for Southern at a job site in Durham, North Carolina. On 10 July 2000, shortly before plaintiff was scheduled to be laid off from the Durham project, plaintiff's supervisor, Charlie Sanders, informed him that he was needed at the Petersburg job site, starting that Thursday.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Plaintiff worked in Durham through Wednesday, 12 July 2000, and reported for work at the site in Petersburg, a steel mill, on Thursday, 13 July 2000. He worked for two days while the plant was shut down. During this time, he received a per diem and stayed at the Flagship Inn in Richmond. Although plaintiff's assignment was supposed to last only through Friday, 14 July 2000, Parker offered plaintiff a position for at least the following week, beginning on Monday, 17 July 2000, because a regular maintenance employee had quit. Plaintiff accepted the second job, but told Parker that he would be late in arriving from his home in Kinston on Monday because he needed to renew his driver's license. While plaintiff had been receiving a more substantial per diem for the two-day job, Parker informed plaintiff that he would only receive a $25.00 per day per diem for the maintenance job.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Plaintiff drove home to Kinston for the weekend and returned to work in Petersburg on Monday at 1:00 p.m. At 5:30 p.m., plaintiff left work for the day and went back to the Flagship Inn for lodging. Because plaintiff had not worked a full eight hours on Monday, he did not receive his per diem and was, therefore, required to pay for the entire cost of the motel room on his own.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Plaintiff ate his dinner in his motel room, but at approximately 11:30 p.m., he left his room to get ice to make his lunch for the next day. He was attacked by several assailants, who beat him, knocked him unconscious, and robbed him of $81.00. An ambulance took plaintiff to the hospital. Plaintiff suffered abrasions and lacerations to his face, contusions under his eyes, a left eye subconjunctival hemorrhage, and a depressed right orbital floor fracture in his right shoulder. In addition, two of plaintiff's front teeth were knocked out.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   After being released from the hospital two days later, on 19 July 2000, plaintiff returned home to Kinston, where he continued to have problems with his right shoulder and consulted with various doctors. Plaintiff was ultimately sent by the North Carolina Department of Vocational Rehabilitation to Dr. Lamont Wooten, an orthopedic surgeon. Dr. Wooten recommended surgery after an MRI revealed a large retracted rotator cuff tear as well as dislocation of the biceps tendon. On 13 September 2000, Dr. Wooten repaired a \"massive\" rotator cuff tear that included a medial dislocation of the biceps tendon. Following the operation, plaintiff was treated with medication, range of motion exercises, and physical therapy. Dr. Wooten released plaintiff from his care and to return to work on 5 April 2001.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   At that time, plaintiff was still experiencing problems with overhead reaching and nighttime pain. Dr. Wooten believed that plaintiff would always have trouble with overhead activities due to the damage to the rotator cuff, and he expressed the opinion that plaintiff's limitations would likely prevent him from being able to perform the ordinary duties of an electrician. Subsequent to being released by Dr. Wooten, plaintiff did not attempt to return to work with Southern or look for work anywhere else.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Defendants denied that plaintiff had suffered an injury by accident. A hearing was conducted before the deputy commissioner, who, on 11 September 2003, entered an opinion and award, concluding that plaintiff was a \"traveling employee\" and that, as a result of the assault, plaintiff had sustained an injury\n   by accident arising out of and in the course of his employment with defendant Southern. The deputy commissioner further determined that plaintiff had failed to prove actual disability after 5 April 2001 under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.C.%20Gen.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%2097-29\">\n    N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 97-29\n   </extracted-citation>\n   or 97-30 (2005). Although the deputy concluded that plaintiff was entitled to permanent partial disability benefits under N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 97-31, she made no award \"at this time\" because of the state of the evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Both plaintiff and defendants appealed to the Full Commission. On appeal, the Commission, with Commissioner Sellers dissenting, \"affirm[ed] with minor modifications the Opinion and Award of the Deputy Commissioner.\" The Full Commission agreed with the deputy commissioner that plaintiff was entitled to temporary total disability compensation for the period of 18 July 2000 through 5 April 2001 and that plaintiff had failed to establish that he was incapable of earning wages in any employment after 5 April 2001. The Commission awarded permanent partial disability benefits in the amount of $588.00 per week for 60 weeks, but made no award at that time for plaintiff's loss of teeth because plaintiff had not adequately addressed that issue. Both plaintiff and defendants timely appealed to this Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <em>\n    Standard of Review\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Our review of a decision of the Industrial Commission \"is limited to determining whether there is any competent evidence to support the findings of fact, and whether the findings of fact justify the conclusions of law.\"\n   <em>\n    Cross v.

For the traveling employee rationale to apply in a case like this one, the travel must involve a distance sufficient to require plaintiff to find lodging at the site rather than commute from his home.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   On the traveling employee issue, the Commission found:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   11. On 17 July 2000, plaintiff was an employee whose job involved traveling to the job sites where defendant-employer assigned him work. Since he was then working at a steel mill in Petersburg, Virginia, he was a traveling employee. Defendant-employer did not pay a per diem allowance to local employees. As Mr. Sanders, plaintiff's former supervisor, testified, it was more cost effective for the company to hire local workers since local workers did not receive the per diem travel allowance. Nevertheless, the company routinely assigned employees, including plaintiff, to jobs that required them to travel and find lodging. The fact that defendant-employer's rules prohibited plaintiff from receiving the per diem amount for the night of 17 July 2000 does not negate the fact that plaintiff was required to stay in a motel in the area since he was so far from home, in order to be able to report for work on time the next morning.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Defendants argue that these findings are not supported by the evidence.

Further, plaintiff testified that Sanders told him that he was being transferred by Southern to Petersburg.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The evidence also supports the Commission's finding that Southern routinely assigned employees to jobs that required travel and lodging. Both Parker, the Petersburg supervisor, and Sanders, the Durham supervisor, indicated that it was more cost effective to hire local employees because of the lack of any need to pay a per diem, but that when local employees were unavailable, the job sites requested non-local employees from the project manager at Southern's home offices in Raleigh. Specifically, Parker testified: \"[I]f we need help, then we let [Raleigh] know, and then they - [i]f we can't get them locally in the area - [w]e try to hire local help if we can get them. But if you can't, then our Raleigh office will, you know, let us know that they got people looking for a job.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   In this case, Parker told his Raleigh project manager that he needed people for the plant shut-down and plaintiff was one of the employees that the project manager \"sent.\" Based on this testimony, the Commission was justified in finding that plaintiff's employment at the Petersburg plant - work that Southern had contracted with the steel mill to perform - required that he travel and stay in motels overnight. Indeed, the evidence establishes, as the Commission found, that plaintiff was paid a per diem while working in Petersburg, although the amount varied between the shut-down job and the maintenance position. As Southern's supervisors confirmed, a per diem was necessary solely because plaintiff was not a local worker and was required to travel.\n   <em>\n    See Martin,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8547975\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc-app/5/37/\">\n    5 N.C.App. at 43\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=167%20S.E.2d%20790\">\n    167 S.E.2d at 794\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"That [eating meals at a restaurant] was a necessary incident of the employment is recognized by the employer when it agreed to pay for his meals.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Other jurisdictions have concluded that comparable facts justified a finding that the employee was a traveling employee.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g., Olinger,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11062372\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne2d/427/910/#p912\">\n    427 N.E.2d at 916\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"In a case such as this, however, where the employee's job was away from his home and his employer's offices, where his job location shifted as the employer required, and where the employer paid him on a\n   <em>\n    per diem\n   </em>\n   basis to help cover the cost of living away from home, we cannot dispute the Board's prerogative in finding the employee is a traveling employee.\");\n   <em>\n    Brown v.

While the record contains evidence that could support defendants' contention, it also contains evidence that Southern assigned plaintiff, a current employee in Durham, to work in Petersburg, thereby requiring plaintiff to travel and stay in a motel overnight; that the assignment was necessary in order for Southern to perform its contractual responsibilities at the Petersburg plant; and that plaintiff, therefore, fell within the rule for traveling employees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Defendants argue alternatively that even if plaintiff was a traveling employee with respect to the shut-down job, the maintenance job was a separate, permanent job in which plaintiff was a regular employee rather than a traveling employee.

The Commission found - in a finding of fact not challenged on appeal and, therefore, binding - that the offer of the maintenance position was only for \"at least the next week.\" Plaintiff continued to receive a per diem, although in a lower amount. Neither the Commission's findings of fact nor the record supporting those findings suggests that the nature of plaintiff's employment changed from that of a traveling employee to a local hire.\n   <em>\n    See Shelton,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"428937\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-app/90/923/#p933\">\n    90 Wash.App. at 936\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=954%20P.2d%20352\">\n    954 P.2d at 359\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (rejecting respondents' argument that the city where the out-of-town job was located had become the employee's home and holding that because the employee \"was required to travel to a specific out-of-town location to fulfill the terms of his employment[,][h]e, therefore, was exposed to greater risks than an employee required only to travel in an ordinary commute from home\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Further, defendants contend that because the maintenance job involved fixed hours at a fixed location, plaintiff was not a traveling employee.

The Court concluded that the plaintiff had failed to meet the \"arising out of\" requirement because \"the required travel merely placed decedent in a position to seize the opportunity to rescue the injured pedestrian. His decision to render aid created the danger;\n   <em>\n    the risk was not a hazard of the journey.\"\n    <extracted-citation index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=364%20S.E.2d%20417\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   The question before the Commission was, therefore, whether the risk of assault at the motel was a hazard of the journey or, in other words, as articulated in\n   <em>\n    Bartlett,\n   </em>\n   a risk peculiar to traveling. The Commission made the following pertinent finding of fact:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   12. At the time of the assault, plaintiff was getting ice at the motel where he was staying. This was an activity that a traveling employee would reasonably be expected to do. The purpose of the assault was robbery. Plaintiff did not know his assailants. There was no personal motive involved with the attack. A traveler staying in a motel would be expected to be carrying\n   cash in order to pay for meals, drinks, fuel and other incidental expenses. Consequently, as a traveling employee at a low cost motel, plaintiff would have been placed at some risk for being robbed. The risk was incidental to his employment, which required him to obtain lodging away from home in places where he was unfamiliar with the neighborhood.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   This reasoning is sufficient to meet the\n   <em>\n    Bartlett\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Roberts\n   </em>\n   test. The hazard to which plaintiff in this case was exposed, assault and robbery, was not something to which he would have been equally exposed apart from his employment-required travel, that necessitated plaintiff's stay in an inexpensive motel located in unfamiliar surroundings. Being assaulted and robbed while obtaining ice from an ice machine to make lunch is a hazard of the journey and a risk peculiar to traveling.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Other jurisdictions reviewing facts analogous to those in this case have reached similar conclusions. In\n   <em>\n    Ark. Dep't of Health v. Huntley,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6142137\" index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ark-app/12/287/#p292\">\n    12 Ark.App. 287\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 292,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6142137\" index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ark-app/12/287/#p292\">\n    675 S.W.2d 845\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 848-49 (1984), the court held that an employee suffered compensable injuries when her out-of-town service calls required her to check into a motel room and she was assaulted as she walked back to her motel room from a nearby bar. Similarly, in\n   <em>\n    Jean Barnes Collections v. Elston,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9565836\" index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/413/797/#p798\">\n    413 So.2d 797\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 798 (Fla.Ct.App.1982), the court held that a traveling employee sustained a compensable accident when she was raped in her hotel room.

Plaintiff has not been awarded compensation simply because his employment placed him a position to be injured, but rather because - as required by the \"increased risk\" doctrine - an incident of his employment, traveling, increased his risk of incurring precisely this type of injury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   <em>\n    Dodson v.
