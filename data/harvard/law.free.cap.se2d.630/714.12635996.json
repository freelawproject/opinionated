Appellant also appeals the court's order denying their motion for a new trial. We find no error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In the late 1970's in Currituck County, Ocean Hill Joint Venture (\"Joint Venture\") and Ocean Hill Properties, Inc. (\"Properties\") (collectively \"the petitioners\") developed a residential subdivision (\"the subdivision\"),\n   which included Ocean Hill I. The recorded plat for Ocean Hill I (\"the Ocean Hill I plat\") identified eight residential roads (\"Ocean Hill I roads\"), three to provide beach access and three to connect other future planned developments within the subdivision. The Ocean Hill I plat \"dedicate[d] all streets, alleys, walks, parks, and other open space to public\n   <em>\n    or\n   </em>\n   private use as noted.\" However, the Ocean Hill I plat failed to identify which streets were public and which were private. Appellant asserts, and the petitioners disagree, that despite the ambiguity in the plat whether Ocean Hill I roads were designated for public or private use, these roads had been private in character since the subdivision's inception. In the early 1990's, Ocean Hill I property owners asked Joint Venture to repair the roads due to wear and tear. On 24 March 1993, pursuant to an agreement, Joint Venture conveyed title to the roads to appellant and appellant agreed to repair and insure the roads. Since 1993, appellant repaired, maintained, and insured Ocean Hill I roads.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In 1989, construction in a new development named the Villages at Ocean Hill (\"the Villages\") surrounding Ocean Hill I dead-ended three Ocean Hill I roads previously designated to connect Ocean Hill I to future developments in the subdivision. The only access for Ocean Hill I residents was limited to North Carolina Route 12, a public highway passing through the Villages and connecting to Coral Lane, one of the eight original roads platted in Ocean Hill I. As a result, disputes arose regarding the increase in the number of non Ocean Hill I residents using their roads.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On 6 September 2001, appellant requested the Board withdraw Joint Venture's dedication of Ocean Hill I roads and close them to the public, pursuant to N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 153A-241. On 7 October 2002, following a public hearing, the Board approved a resolution to withdraw the dedication of Ocean Hill I roads. On 4 November 2002, subsequent to the public hearing, the Board voted unanimously to close the roads. Specifically, they explained that \"closing ... the roads would not be contrary to the public interest and would not deprive any individual owning property in the vicinity of the roads reasonable means of ingress and egress to his property.\" On the same day, the Board approved an order to close Ocean Hill I roads to the general public.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On 27 November 2002, pursuant to N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 153A-241, petitioners appealed the Board's order by filing a\n   <em>\n    writ of certiorari\n   </em>\n   in Currituck County Superior Court. Petitioners alleged closing Ocean Hill I roads to the general public \"[was] against and contrary to the public interest\" and claimed they were \"persons aggrieved\" by the order. On 3 December 2002, pursuant to N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 153A-241, the trial court ordered the Board to certify the complete record resulting in the 4 November 2002 order. On 6 February 2003, appellant filed an answer to petitioners' writ and requested a jury trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   At trial, two members of the Currituck County Board of Commissioners (\"the Board\") and a law enforcement officer testified for appellant. Commissioner Paul O'Neal referred to Ocean Hill I and stated, \"[a] subdivision that is going to be open to the public ... is required to have more than one ingress and egress ... [and the Board] would require some parking for the general public.\" The second member of the Board to testify, James Etheridge, explained, \"there [are] no parking areas ... [,] there is no off street parking ... [,][and][t]here is only one entrance and exit[.]\" Finally, Sheriff Susan Johnson (\"Sheriff Johnson\") of Currituck County focused on safety issues not only because of congestion but also because Ocean Hill, Section 1 \"is so difficult to traverse, I think that public safety outweighs public interest in some cases.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   At trial, Gerald Friedman, a land developer involved with the subdivision, testified for the petitioners. He explained the roads in Ocean Hill I were to be public, the State was to eventually take over the roads, and the conveyance of the roads to appellant in 1993 was not intended to give away public access. Hood Ellis, an attorney who represented Gerald Friedman in the development of the subdivision, also testified for the petitioners. He said \"[Ocean Hill] was always going to be a public subdivision. In other words, the\n   neighborhood just like I live in. We have residential platted lots on public streets.\" Several residents of the Villages also testified. One of the petitioners, Rosalee Chiara, had safety concerns if the roads in Ocean Hill, Section 1, were made private. She was not concerned about getting to and from her home but was concerned about being deprived \"of getting to and from the beach safely.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   At the conclusion of the evidence, both petitioners and appellant moved for a directed verdict and the trial court denied each motion. The jury determined closing Ocean Hill I roads to the general public was contrary to the public interest. Appellant's motion for a new trial was denied. Appellant appeals the judgment entered upon the jury verdict and order denying the motion for a new trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   I.\n   <em>\n    Burden of Proof\n   </em>\n   :\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Appellant argues the trial court erred by placing the burden on them to illustrate the Board correctly determined that closing the roads in Ocean Hill I was not contrary to the public interest. Appellant contends the trial court placed the burden of proof upon the wrong party. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   a.\n   <em>\n    De novo hearing\n   </em>\n   :\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   N.C.

Similarly, in the instant case, N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 153A-241 mandates a\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   hearing by the superior court for an appeal of a county board order to close a public road. Thus, the trial court properly held a\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   hearing respecting the determination of the Board to close Ocean Hill I roads.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Pursuant to the statutorily mandated\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   hearing and\n   <em>\n    Hanks\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Carroll, supra,\n   </em>\n   there is no presumption in favor of a lower tribunal's determination and, furthermore, the burden of proof remains on the party who shouldered the burden at the lower tribunal. \"Since the hearing on appeal in the Superior Court was\n   <em>\n    de novo,\n   </em>\n   if the [appellant] had the burden of proof at the first hearing, obviously [they] also had the burden at the\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   hearing in the Superior Court.\"\n   <em>\n    Joyner v.

Consequently, the trial court correctly determined that the burden of proof, initially placed upon the appellant because they sought to change the status of Ocean Hill I roads from public to private, remained on the appellant for the\n   trial\n   <em>\n    de novo.\n   </em>\n   Thus, pursuant to a\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   hearing, we hold the burden of proof remained with the appellant and overrule appellant's corresponding assignments of error numbers one, five, six, and seven.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   II.\n   <em>\n    Directed Verdict:\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Appellant argues the trial court erred in denying their motion for directed verdict.
