That contact led to the armed robbery, carjacking, kidnapping, and murder of Mr. Patten and Ms. Brown. Petitioner was tried before a jury on charges related to those crimes. The jury acquitted him of all charges save for two counts of kidnapping. He challenged the kidnapping convictions on appeal and won the right to be retried on those charges. <em>See Odum v. State, </em>156 Md.App. 184, 846 A.2d 445 (2004). At the retrial, the State presented, over Petitioner\u2019s objection, evidence concerning the crimes of which he was acquitted. Petitioner again was convicted of both kidnapping charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-9\">Petitioner has challenged those convictions, arguing that the jury should not have been presented with evidence of the murders and other criminal conduct involving Petitioner and his cohorts. He advances two grounds in support: (1) the State was collaterally estopped from presenting evidence of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>the crimes of which he was acquitted at the first trial; and (2) the evidence was not relevant to prove the kidnappings and, even if relevant, the trial court should have excluded it because its probative value was outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to his right to a fair trial. For the reasons that follow, we reject both arguments and hold that the court neither erred nor abused its discretion in admitting the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-6\">The jury heard the following evidence at Petitioner\u2019s retrial. On the night of Saturday, June 9, 2001, Petitioner attended a party in the Fort Washington area of Prince George\u2019s County, near where he lived. Aaron Hollingsworth, Cortez Carroll, and Marco Butler, all neighbors and friends of Petitioner, were also in attendance at the party. After the party, the four men were joined by another friend from the neighborhood, Eric Thomas. The five men\u2014Petitioner, Hollingsworth, Butler, Carroll, and Thomas\u2014found their way during the early morning hours of June 10 to a nearby wooded area adjacent to the parking lot of the Fort Washington United Methodist Church. Butler and Carroll were carrying handguns.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-7\">Sometime after 2:00 a.m., an Acura was driven onto the church parking lot. Michael Patten, the owner of the Acura, was behind the wheel. In the passenger seat was his friend, Lee Ann Brown. Mr. Patten and Ms. Brown had come from a night of entertainment at a nightclub in Washington, D.C. Mr. Patten, a congregant at the Fort Washington United Methodist Church, evidently pulled the car onto the church parking lot to allow Ms. Brown to step out and relieve herself. Shortly thereafter, the two were confronted by Petitioner and his companions.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-8\">Aaron Hollingsworth, who testified for the State as part of a plea bargain, described what happened next. One of the men approached the car and ordered Mr. Patten out of it. Hollingsworth then went up to Mr. Patten and demanded money. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>When Mr. Patten claimed he had no money, Hollingsworth searched him and found $30. Hollingsworth, angered that Mr. Patten had lied to him, struck Mr. Patten several times. When Mr. Patten fell to the ground, Hollingsworth kicked him.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-5\">Meanwhile, others in the group approached Ms. Brown, who by this time was standing next to the passenger side of the car. Hollingsworth and one other member of the group, whose identity Hollingsworth did not recall, put the unconscious Mr. Patten into the trunk of the Acura. Hollingsworth and a second, unnamed member of the group then forced Ms. Brown into the trunk. . Hollingsworth hit Ms. Brown, and Carroll pistol whipped her, to make her duck down into the trunk. Hollingsworth closed the trunk by sitting on its lid.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-6\">Then, with Eric Thomas behind the wheel of the Acura and the victims in the trunk, the five men drove ten to fifteen minutes to a secluded spot in the Accokeek area of Prince George\u2019s County. During the drive to Accokeek, Hollingsworth gave $5 to each of the men from the money he had taken from Mr. Patten. Upon arrival at their destination, Hollingsworth, with help from one of the others whose identity he could not recall, removed Mr. Patten and Ms. Brown from the trunk of the car. Soon thereafter, one or more persons (not Hollingsworth) shot and killed Mr. Patten and Ms. Brown.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-7\">The five men, including Petitioner, got back into the car, with Eric Thomas once again in the driver\u2019s seat. Thomas, who was drunk, almost crashed the car after driving it a short distance. Petitioner then took over the driving. The five men drove to Southeast Washington, where they pooled the $30 that Hollingsworth had earlier distributed to them and used $20 of it to purchase marijuana. The five men then drove to an ATM machine and withdrew $20, using Ms. Brown\u2019s ATM card and PIN that at some point during the episode one of the five men had obtained from her.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Thereafter, the men headed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>home. During the ride, they discussed that \u201cthis shouldn\u2019t come back up no more,\u201d which, according to Hollingsworth, meant that they were \u201cnot to talk about it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b627-5\">The State presented significant forensic evidence and witness testimony corroborating the testimony of Hollingsworth. Specifically, the State introduced evidence that the victims\u2019 bodies were discovered in Accokeek on the afternoon of June 10, 2001, the abandoned vehicle was found several days later, and blood stains on the church parking lot were created by Mr. Patten\u2019s blood. The State offered evidence that the exterior of the Acura had Mr. Patten\u2019s blood on it, the trunk of the Acura contained an earring and the blood of both Mr. Patten and Ms. Brown, and the rearview mirror contained a latent fingerprint matching Petitioner\u2019s fingerprint. The State also offered evidence of shell casings that were found under and near the victims\u2019 bodies.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-6\">\n<em>The Motion in Limine</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b627-7\">All of the above evidence relating to the murder of Mr. Patten and Ms. Brown and the subsequent activity of Petitioner, including use of the robbery proceeds to purchase drugs, was admitted over the continuing objection of the defense. Petitioner challenged the admissibility of that evidence at a pretrial hearing. He argued that evidence relating to the murders and other criminal activity was barred by the doctrine of collateral estoppel, among other related constitutional and common law doctrines. Petitioner also argued that evidence of those crimes was not relevant to the kidnapping charges because the kidnappings were complete as soon as the victims were placed in the trunk of their car and driven away. He further argued that the challenged evidence, even if relevant to the kidnappings, was unduly prejudicial to his right to a fair trial, rendering it inadmissible under Maryland Rule 5-403. Petitioner offered to stipulate that the victims were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>unavailable to testify and to agree to an instruction \u201cthat the jury is not to draw any negative inferences from that.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b628-5\">The State responded that the doctrine of collateral estoppel neither prohibited retrial on the kidnapping charges nor foreclosed admission of evidence of the crimes of which Petitioner was acquitted. The State also argued that evidence of those crimes was relevant to make sense of the charged kidnappings, show Petitioner\u2019s role in the entire episode, and corroborate Hollingsworth\u2019s testimony concerning what happened and the part Petitioner played. The State said: \u201cI can\u2019t imagine a jury listening to a case involving a kidnapping, not being presented with information as to the force used, as to the location of the transportation, and where the journey ended. And why it ended. And how it ended.\u201d The State argued further that the jury naturally would question the failure of the State to have the victims testify. The State also pointed out that the jury needed to hear corroboration of Petitioner\u2019s statement (which, as it turned out, was not admitted into evidence) and Hollingsworth\u2019s testimony implicating Petitioner as an accomplice. Finally, the State argued: \u201cWhat happened afterwards is very much relevant to show whether or not [Petitioner] was part of the team.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b628-6\">The trial court denied Petitioner\u2019s motion to exclude evidence of the crimes of which he had been acquitted at the first trial:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-7\">[T]he court finds that the events leading up to the course and aftermath of the kidnappings are certainly relevant to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>the kidnappings charge [sic], to the overall criminal venture and to the Defendant\u2019s role and participation with others in it. Having viewed the transcripts of the prior trial and proceedings, the course of the State\u2019s order and burden of proof, the fact that the series of events and crimes are so inextricably intertwined in time and circumstances and that the evidence integral to prove one is similarly integral to proof of the other, the Court finds that the probative value of evidence of events leading up to the kidnappings and evidence of events that take place after the kidnappings outweigh any unfair prejudice.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b629-5\">Assuming that there are no problems of identity, however, the Court finds, certainly, with respect to the scene, photographs of victims and the autopsy photographs, that the prejudice to the Defendant would outweigh any probative value in that light. The Court will reserve its ruling on the autopsy report depending upon the course of certain events that may or may not take place during trial.[<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b629-6\">The court granted Petitioner a continuing objection to any and all evidence or testimony concerning the facts of the crimes of which he was acquitted in the first trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-7\">\n<em>The Appeal</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b629-8\">Petitioner argued before the Court of Special Appeals that the trial court\u2019s allowance of evidence of the other crimes that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>occurred during the criminal episode violated the doctrine of collateral estoppel and the relevant rules of evidence. The Court of Special Appeals, over the dissent of one judge, affirmed the convictions in an unreported opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-5\">With regard to Petitioner\u2019s collateral estoppel argument, the Court of Special Appeals observed that \u201cthe doctrine of collateral estoppel prohibits re-litigation of the <em>same factual issue </em>[,]\u201d (emphasis in original), and Petitioner \u201chas not established that\u2014when acquitting him of various charges\u2014the jury resolved in his favor any factual issue that would have to be resolved in the second trial.\u201d The Court therefore held that \u201cthe evidence was not subject to exclusion on the ground of double jeopardy collateral estoppel.\u201d The Court further held that the trial court correctly ruled that the other crimes evidence was relevant to the charged kidnapping offenses and did not abuse its discretion in deciding that the probative value of the evidence outweighed the risk of unfair prejudice to Petitioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-6\">Petitioner filed a petition for writ of certiorari, which we granted, <em>Odum v. State, </em>405 Md. 290, 950 A.2d 828 (2008), to answer the following question:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b630-7\">Was it was error to allow, at the retrial, evidence of the many other felonies and crimes of violence of which Petitioner was acquitted by a jury, at his first trial?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b630-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-9\">Petitioner argues, as he did in the Court of Special Appeals, that for two reasons the trial court committed reversible error by admitting evidence of the crimes of which he was acquitted at the first trial. He argues that admission of the evidence ran afoul of the doctrine of collateral estoppel. He further argues that the evidence was irrelevant to proof of the kidnapping charges, and, even if it was relevant, the trial court abused its discretion by admitting the evidence because its probative value was outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to him. We shall address each argument, in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>\n<em>Collateral Estoppel</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b631-4\">The Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution forbids any person from being \u201ctwice put in jeopardy of life or limb.\u201d That prohibition \u201cagainst making a defendant twice accountable for the same offense is a provision applicable to the States\u201d through the Fourteenth Amendment. <em>See State v. Long, </em>405 Md. 527, 535-36, 954 A.2d 1083, 1088-89 (2008) (citing <em>Benton v. Maryland, </em>395 U.S. 784, 794, 89 S.Ct. 2056, 2062, 23 L.Ed.2d 707, 716 (1969)).</p>\n<p id=\"b631-5\">The Supreme Court has recognized that the Double Jeopardy Clause incorporates the doctrine of collateral estoppel. <em>Ashe v. Swenson, </em>397 U.S. 436, 444-45, 90 S.Ct. 1189, 1194, 25 L.Ed.2d 469, 475-76 (1970). The Court in <em>Ashe </em>defined collateral estoppel as meaning \u201csimply that when an issue of ultimate fact has once been determined by a valid and final judgment, that issue cannot again be litigated between the same parties in any future lawsuit.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 443, 90 S.Ct. at 1194, 25 L.Ed.2d at 475.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-6\"><em>Ashe </em>involved the robbery by a group of masked men of six persons playing poker in the basement of a home. Ashe was tried for the robbery of one of the poker players and acquitted. He was later tried for the robbery of another of the players and convicted.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-7\">The Supreme Court reversed the conviction, holding that the State was collaterally estopped from pursuing the second robbery charge. The Court cautioned that the \u201crule of collateral estoppel in criminal cases is not to be applied with the hypertechnical and archaic approach of a 19th century pleading book, but with realism and rationality.\u201d 397 U.S. at 444, 90 S.Ct. at 1194, 25 L.Ed.2d at 475-76. Therefore, \u201c[wjhere a previous judgment of acquittal was based on a general verdict,\u201d courts must \u201cexamine the record of [the] prior proceeding, taking into account the pleadings, evidence, charge, and other relevant matter, and conclude whether a rational jury could have grounded its verdict upon an issue other than that which the defendant seeks to foreclose from consideration.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Applying <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>that rule, the Court concluded that the acquittal of Ashe in the first trial barred the second trial because</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AnC\">the record is utterly devoid of any indication that the first jury could rationally have found that an armed robbery had not occurred, or that [the named victim in that case] had not been a victim of that robbery. The single rationally conceivable issue in dispute before the jury was whether [Ashe] had been one of the robbers. And the jury by its verdict found that he had not. The federal rule of law, therefore, would make a second prosecution for the robbery of [the second named victim] wholly impermissible.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b632-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 445, 90 S.Ct. at 1195, 25 L.Ed.2d at 476.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-5\">Later, in <em>Dowling v. United States, </em>493 U.S. 342, 347-48, 110 S.Ct. 668, 671-72, 107 L.Ed.2d 708, 717 (1990), the Court was asked to apply the rationale and holding of <em>Ashe </em>to reverse the defendant Dowling\u2019s bank robbery conviction. The government had been permitted to offer at trial on the bank robbery charges evidence that Dowling had been involved in a burglary two weeks after the bank robbery, notwithstanding that the trial of the burglary case had resulted in his acquittal. Dowling argued that, by extension of the rationale underlying <em>Ashe, </em>the Government should have been collaterally estopped from offering that evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-6\">The Court first considered the lower burden of proof that governs the admission of \u201csimilar act evidence,\u201d under Federal Rule of Evidence-404(b). The Court noted that, under that rule, \u201c \u2018similar act evidence is relevant only if the jury can reasonably conclude that the act occurred and that the defendant was the actor.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 348, 110 S.Ct. at 672, 107 L.Ed.2d at 718 (quoting <em>Huddleston v. United States, </em>485 U.S. 681, 689, 108 S.Ct. 1496, 1501, 99 L.Ed.2d 771, 782 (1988)). Further, \u201c[b]ecause a jury might reasonably conclude that Dowling was the masked man who entered [the burglary victim\u2019s] home, even if it did not believe beyond a reasonable doubt that Dowling committed the crimes charged at the first trial, the collateral-estoppel component of the Double Jeopardy Clause is inapposite.\u201d <em>Dowling, </em>493 U.S. at 348-49, 110 S.Ct. at 672, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>107 L.Ed.2d at 718. In other words, a defendant\u2019s acquittal of a charged crime does not preclude the prosecution, on collateral estoppel grounds, from offering at a later proceeding evidence of the defendant\u2019s commission of the crime, so long as the admissibility of evidence of the defendant\u2019s commission of that other crime is governed by a lower standard of proof. <em>Id. </em>at 349-50, 110 S.Ct. at 672-73, 107 L.Ed.2d at 719.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-5\">The Court added that evidence of the burglary was not barred in Dowling\u2019s bank robbery trial, even under an <em>Ashe </em>analysis. The Court \u201cagreefd] with the Government that the challenged evidence was nevertheless admissible [under <em>Ashe </em>1 because Dowling did not demonstrate that his acquittal in his first trial represented a jury determination that he was not one of the men\u201d who participated in the burglary that formed the basis of the other crime evidence. <em>Id. </em>at 353, 110 S.Ct. at 675, 107 L.Ed.2d at 721. The Court adopted the rule employed by a number of United States Courts of Appeals in cases applying <em>Ashe </em>that \u201cplacefs] the burden on the defendant to demonstrate that the issue whose relitigation he seeks to foreclose was actually decided in the first proceeding.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 350-51, 110 S.Ct. at 673, 107 L.Ed.2d at 719. After examining the entire record in the case, as required by <em>Ashe, </em>the Court concluded: \u201cThere are any number of possible explanations for the jury\u2019s acquittal verdict at Dowling\u2019s first trial. As the record stands, there is nothing at all that persuasively indicates that the question of identity was at issue and was determined in Dowling\u2019s favor at the prior trial....\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 352, 110 S.Ct. at 674, 107 L.Ed.2d at 720. Consequently, Dowling\u2019s acquittal of the subsequent burglary did not bar admission of evidence of that crime at his bank robbery trial.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 353, 110 S.Ct. at 675, 107 L.Ed.2d at 721.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>Much like the Supreme Court has done in recognizing collateral estoppel as a form of constitutionally based double jeopardy, we recognize the collateral estoppel form of double jeopardy as a part of Maryland common law. <em>See Long, </em>405 Md. at 538, 954 A.2d at 1090. We define collateral estoppel in the same way as is done in the federal constitutional context, and, in that regard, we have said that the \u201ccritical question to be confronted when considering the proper invocation of the principles of collateral estoppel is \u2018whether an issue of ultimate fact has been previously determined in favor of the defendant.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 539, 954 A.2d at 1090 (quoting <em>Butler v. State, </em>335 Md. 238, 253, 643 A.2d 389, 396 (1994)). In other words, \u201cif the verdict must have, by logical necessity, decided a particular fact in favor of a defendant, then the State will be barred by collateral estoppel principles from relitigating that fact.\u201d <em>Butler, </em>335 Md. at 253, 643 A.2d at 396 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). And, as did the <em>Dowling </em>Court, we place the burden of proof on the defendant \u201cto demonstrate that the fact for which he or she is seeking to bar relitigation was decided in a prior proceeding.\u201d <em>Long, </em>405 Md. at 539, 954 A.2d at 1091. That burden is a difficult one to carry. <em>See State v. Woodson, </em>338 Md. 322, 331, 658 A.2d 272, 277 (1995) (stating that \u201ca defendant has a difficult burden to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>overcome in establishing that the issue was actually decided in the first proceeding\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b635-5\">We agree with the Court of Special Appeals that Petitioner did not carry the difficult burden of establishing that the State was collaterally estopped from offering evidence of the other crimes that occurred before and after the kidnappings. Like the trial court did when ruling on the motion in limine and the Court of Special Appeals did when reviewing the trial court\u2019s ruling, we have examined the entire record, including the transcript of the first trial. The first jury\u2019s guilty verdicts on the kidnapping counts are easily reconciled with the jury\u2019s acquittals on the remaining counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-6\">Petitioner\u2019s confession to the police, which the jury in the first trial saw and heard about, provides one rational explanation for the verdicts. Petitioner told the police that he did not participate in the initial encounter between the victims and his cohorts, but rather observed it from a vantage point across the street from the church parking lot. He also told the police that he accompanied the others in the car ride to Accokeek only because two of his cohorts, Thomas and Carroll, told him to do so, and he \u201cwas scared.\u201d The jury rationally could have credited Petitioner\u2019s assertion that he did not participate in the robberies, carjacking, murders, and other criminal behavior, while rejecting his assertion that he accompanied the others in the kidnappings solely out of fear for his safety.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-7\">There is, however, an even more fundamental impediment to Petitioner\u2019s collateral estoppel argument. The acquittals of Petitioner at the first trial did not preclude the State at the retrial from offering evidence of his involvement in the commission of those crimes, by application of the <em>Dowling </em>rationale that a defendant\u2019s acquittal of a crime does not erect a collateral estoppel bar to admission of evidence of the defendant\u2019s commission of that crime at a later proceeding. As the <em>Dowling </em>Court held, other crimes evidence, under Federal Rule of Evidence 404(b), is subject to a lower burden of proof than is required for conviction. 493 U.S. at 348, 110 S.Ct. at 672, 107 L.Ed.2d at 718. For reasons we shall discuss in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>next part of this opinion, evidence that Petitioner was involved in the other criminal activity that occurred during the same episode as the charged kidnappings is not \u201cother crimes\u201d evidence, as that term is used in Maryland Rule 5-404(b). Even so, the <em>Dowling </em>rationale for why the State is not collaterally estopped from offering evidence of the offenses of which Petitioner was acquitted applies with equal force to the present case, because the admissibility of that evidence is not dependent on the State\u2019s having to establish, beyond a reasonable doubt, that Petitioner committed those offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-5\">In sum, the mere fact that the jury in the first trial acquitted Petitioner of the counts charging him with the murder and other offenses that occurred immediately before and after the kidnappings does not present a collateral estoppel bar to admission of evidence of those crimes at Petitioner\u2019s retrial for the kidnappings.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-6\">\n<em>The Rules of Evidence</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b636-7\">Petitioner also argues on evidentiary grounds that (1) evidence of his involvement in the murders and other criminal activity that occurred during the episode was inadmissible because it was irrelevant to the charged kidnapping offenses, and (2) that evidence, even if relevant, should have been excluded because its probative value was outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-8\">It is settled that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b636-9\">\u201cThe real test of admissibility of evidence in a criminal case is the connection of the fact proved with the offense charged, as evidence which has a natural tendency to establish the fact at issue.... [Ejvidence, to be admissible, must be relevant to the issues and must tend either to establish or disprove them. Evidence which is thus not probative of the proposition at which it is directed is deemed irrelevant.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b636-10\"><em>Sifrit v. State, </em>388 Md. 116, 129, 857 A.2d 88, 95 (2004) (quoting <em>Dorsey v. State, </em>276 Md. 638, 643, 350 A.2d 665, 668-669 (1976)).</p>\n<p id=\"b637-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>\u201cRelevant evidence\u201d is defined in our rules of evidence as \u201cevidence having any tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence.\u201d Md. Rule 5-401. Relevant evidence is generally admissible; evidence that is not relevant is never admissible. <em>See </em>Md. Rule 5-402 (providing: \u201cExcept as otherwise provided by constitutions, statutes or these rules, or by decisional law not inconsistent with these rules, all relevant evidence is admissible. Evidence that is not relevant is not admissible\u201d); <em>Merzbacher v. State, </em>346 Md. 391, 404, 697 A.2d 432, 439 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b637-5\">Although Rule 5-402 creates a presumption of admissibility of relevant evidence, other rules of evidence, for various reasons, restrict its admissibility. Maryland Rule 5-403 is one such rule. That rule provides: \u201cAlthough relevant, evidence may be excluded if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or misleading the jury, or by considerations of undue delay, waste of time, or needless presentation of cumulative evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b637-6\">We shall address Petitioner\u2019s contentions that evidence of the other crimes that occurred during the criminal episode was irrelevant to proof that he committed the kidnappings and, even if that evidence were relevant, it was nonetheless inadmissible, by application of Rule 5-403. Before we do, we dispose of an issue that arose when the appeal was before the Court of Special Appeals and deals with the applicability, if any, to this case of Maryland Rule 5-404(b). That rule of evidence restricts the admissibility of evidence of \u201cother crimes, wrongs, or acts,\u201d unless that evidence has special relevance to the case. <em>Ayers v. State, </em>335 Md. 602, 630-31, 645 A.2d 22, 36 (1994). Rule 5-404(b) provides: \u201cEvidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts is not admissible to prove the character of a person in order to show action in conformity therewith. It may, however, be admissible for other purposes, such as proof of motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>common scheme or plan, knowledge, identity, or absence of mistake or accident.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b638-5\">Rule 5-404(b) \u201cembodies the Maryland common law of evidence concerning other crimes [], which existed prior to the adoption of the Rule.\u201d <em>Boyd v. State, </em>399 Md. 457, 482, 924 A.2d 1112, 1126 (2007). Under the common law rule, \u201cin a prosecution for a particular crime, evidence which in any manner shows or tends to show that the accused has committed another crime wholly independent of that for which he is on trial, even though it be a crime of the same type, is ... inadmissible.\u201d <em>Ross v. State, </em>276 Md. 664, 669, 350 A.2d 680, 684 (1976) (emphasis added); <em>accord Merzbacher v. State, </em>346 Md. at 410, 697 A.2d at 441-42 (quoting <em>Ross </em>for the rule that other crimes evidence is generally inadmissible if it is evidence of conduct \u201c ^wholly independent of that for which [the appellant] was on trial\u2019 \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b638-6\">There are two reasons for this general rule of exclusion. <em>Ayers, </em>335 Md. at 630, 645 A.2d at 36. \u201c \u2018First, if a jury considers a defendant\u2019s prior criminal activity, it may decide to convict and punish him for having a criminal disposition. Second, a jury might infer that because the defendant has committed crimes in the past, he is more likely to have committed the crime for which he is being tried.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Straughn v. State, </em>297 Md. 329, 333, 465 A.2d 1166, 1168-69 (1983)); <em>see also Terry v. State, </em>332 Md. 329, 334, 631 A.2d 424, 426 (1993) (other crimes evidence \u201cis excluded because it may tend to confuse the jurors, predispose them to a belief in the defendant\u2019s guilt, or prejudice their minds against the defendant\u201d).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b638-7\">The Court of Special Appeals elaborated on this point in <em>Dixon v. State, </em>133 Md.App. 325, 330-31, 755 A.2d 560, 562-63 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>(2000) , <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds, </em>364 Md. 209, 772 A.2d 283 (2001) . The court explained why evidence of uncharged criminal activity that takes place at the crime scene \u201cdoes not necessarily engage the gears of \u2018other crimes\u2019 evidence law\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b639-6\">The ultimate end to be served by the ban on \u201cother crimes\u201d evidence is that the State should not be permitted to bring in \u201cout of left field\u201d the fact that on some other occasion the defendant committed a crime. The danger being guarded against is that such past behavior will be offered to show and will be used by a jury to conclude that the defendant has a propensity to commit crime. The fear is that the jury may convict him in the case on trial because of something other than what he did in that case, to wit, because of his criminal propensity.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b639-7\">Although the direct evidence of what happens at a crime scene may sometimes show some possible crime in addition to the one literally charged, that coincidental possibility does not necessarily engage the gears of \u201cother crimes\u201d evidence law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b639-8\"><em>See also </em>Lynn McLain, Maryland Evidence State and Federal \u00a7 404.5 (2009 Supp.) (\u201cActs that are part of the alleged crime itself (such as acts in furtherance of an alleged conspiracy), or put in its immediate context, are not \u2018other acts\u2019 and thus do not have to comply with Md. Rule 5\u2014404(b).\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b639-9\">The above authorities reflect the common law principle that the strictures of \u201cother crimes\u201d evidence law, now embodied in Rule 5-404(b), do not apply to evidence of crimes (or other bad acts or wrongs) that arise during the same transaction and are intrinsic to the charged crime or crimes. We define \u201cintrinsic\u201d as including, at a minimum, other crimes that are so connected or blended in point of time or circumstances with the crime or crimes charged that they form a single transaction, and the crime or crimes charged cannot be fully shown or explained without evidence of the other crimes. Our conclusion is in accord with the interpretation that various federal courts of appeal have given to Federal Rule of Evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>404(b), from which Maryland Rule 404(b) is derived. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Chin, </em>83 F.3d 83, 87-88 (4th Cir.1996) (collecting cases from other federal courts of appeal and stating: \u201cWe agree with the other circuits that where testimony is admitted as to acts intrinsic to the crime charged, and is not admitted solely to demonstrate bad character, it is admissible\u201d; and defining as \u201cintrinsic,\u201d other criminal acts that are \u201cinextricably intertwined or both acts are part of a single criminal episode or the other acts were necessary preliminaries to the crime charged.\u201d).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b641-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>In the present case, evidence of the robberies that precipitated the kidnappings, the carjacking that facilitated the kidnappings, the murders that brought a tragic close to the kidnappings, and the subsequent use of the proceeds of the robbery to purchase drugs, arose out of the same criminal episode. We recognized in <em>State v. Stouffer, </em>352 Md. 97, 113, 721 A.2d 207, 215 (1998), that a kidnapping is sometimes incidental to another crime, and we identified several factors relevant to identifying the connection between the offenses:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ABz\">How far, and where, was the victim taken? How long was the victim detained in relation to what was necessary to complete the crime? Was the movement either inherent as an element, or, as a practical matter, necessary to the commission, of the other crime? Did it have some independent purpose? Did the asportation subject the victim to any additional significant danger?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b641-4\">We also pointed out that kidnapping is a continuing offense and does not end simply because the victim has been moved some distance. We noted that, after the victim was stabbed, \u201che was dragged into the car and, while still alive, driven to Pennsylvania. That conduct suffices at least as a continuation of the kidnapping.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 114; 721 A.2d at 215. We likened the facts of <em>Stouffer </em>to <em>State v. Gomez, </em>225 Conn. 347, 622 A.2d 1014, 1016 (1993), and we emphasized that, \u201c[ajs was the case in <em>Gomez, </em>the victim in this case was never released, the kidnapping ended only with his death.\u201d <em>Stouffer, </em>352 Md. at 114, 721 A.2d at 215-16 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b642-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>The \u201chow far,\u201d \u201cwhere\u201d and \u201cwhy\u201d of the kidnappings\u2014all necessary to establishing Petitioner\u2019s role in those crimes\u2014 was explained by evidence of the murders of Mr. Patten and Ms. Brown that followed the initial accosting of them in the church parking lot, at the scene of which Petitioner was present; Petitioner\u2019s sharing of the proceeds of the robberies; and his taking the wheel of the victims\u2019 carjacked Acura following the murders and driving his associates into Washington, D.C., where they bought marijuana with the money taken from Mr. Patten and withdrew money from an ATM machine using the ATM card that was taken from Ms. Brown. That same evidence also corroborated the details of the testimony of Aaron Hollingsworth, which was crucial to the State\u2019s theory that Petitioner was an active participant in the entire criminal transaction, not, as he had argued, merely an unwilling bystander. <em>See Williams v. </em>State, 364 Md. 160, 179, 771 A.2d 1082, 1093 (2001) (\u201cThe longstanding law in Maryland is that a conviction may not rest on the uncorroborated testimony of an accomplice.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b642-4\">In sum, the robbery, carjacking, murders, and subsequent use of the proceeds of the crimes were all intrinsic to the kidnappings. Those crimes were so connected or blended in point of time or circumstances with the kidnappings that they formed one transaction; moreover, the kidnappings could not be fully shown or explained without evidence of the other crimes. Therefore, admissibility of evidence of those crimes was not governed by Rule 5-404(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b642-5\">We turn, then, to Petitioner\u2019s arguments concerning the relevance and ultimate admissibility of the evidence of his involvement in the murder and other criminal activity at the retrial of the kidnapping charges. For the same reasons why the other crimes were intrinsic to the kidnappings, evidence of those other crimes tended to establish Petitioner\u2019s complicity in the kidnappings and, therefore, was relevant to proof of the kidnappings. <em>See </em>Md. Rule 5-401. The trial court was correct in so ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>We have said that relevant evidence is admissible, under Maryland Rule 5-402, subject to the court\u2019s exercise of discretion to exclude it, under Maryland Rule 5-403, \u201cif its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or misleading the jury.\u201d Petitioner argues that the court abused its discretion by admitting the evidence because it unfairly prejudiced his right to a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-4\">As we consider that argument, we keep in mind that \u201cthe fact that evidence prejudices one party or the other, in the sense that it hurts his or her case, is not the undesirable prejudice referred to in Rule 5-403.\u201d McLain, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 403:l(b) (2d ed. 2001); <em>accord </em>Joseph F. Murphy Jr., Maryland Criminal Evidence Handbook \u00a7 506(B) (3d ed. 1993 &amp; Supp. 2007). Evidence may be unfairly prejudicial \u201cif it might influence the jury to disregard the evidence or lack of evidence regarding the particular crime with which he is being charged.\u201d McLain, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 403:l(b). The more probative the evidence is of the crime charged, the less likely it is that the evidence will be unfairly prejudicial.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-5\">It has been said that \u201c[pjrobative value is outweighed by the danger of <em>\u2018unfair </em>\u2019 prejudice when the evidence produces such an emotional response that logic cannot overcome prejudice or sympathy needlessly injected into the case.\u201d Murphy, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 506(B) (emphasis in original). The evidence that Petitioner sought to exclude was highly probative of his complicity in the charged kidnappings, for the reasons we have stated. Although the evidence surely prejudiced Petitioner, we are not persuaded that it <em>unfairly </em>prejudiced him, much less that the prejudice \u201csubstantially outweighed\u201d the probative value of the evidence. <em>See </em>Md. Rule 5-403.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-6\">We therefore hold that the trial court neither erred not abused its discretion in allowing the State to present evidence of the other crimes that occurred during the criminal episode that included the kidnapping of Mr. Patten and Ms. Brown.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-7\">JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS AFFIRMED. COSTS TO BE PAID BY PETITIONER.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b626-8\">. Evidence adduced at the first trial showed that Carroll had gone through Ms. Brown\u2019s purse at the church parking lot and found her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>ATM card, and that Ms. Brown volunteered the PIN. <em>See Odum v.

Petitioner also argued that he was entitled, as a matter of due process, to have admitted into evidence \"a public record\u201d reflecting his acquittal on each of the other charges. We could find no record indication that the State objected to the admission of that evidence, either then or when Petitioner re-raised the issue, after the State rested its case in chief. At that time, defense counsel stated that the \"only possible thing\u201d the defense would present \u201cwould be certified copies of [Petitioner\u2019s] acquittal or a stipulation concerning that.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b628-10\">Petitioner rested without putting on a defense case.

The Supreme Court further addressed the collateral estoppel doctrine in <em>Yeager v. United </em>States,-U.S.-, 129 S.Ct. 2360, 174 L.Ed.2d 78 (2009). That case involved the retrial of a defendant whose first trial resulted in the jury\u2019s acquittal on some counts and failure to return a verdict on other counts, resulting in a mistrial on the counts on which the jury had hung. The issue before the Court was whether, in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>determining the preclusive effect of a jury\u2019s verdict of acquittal, consideration could be given to the jury\u2019s failure to render a verdict on other counts. <em>Id. </em>at 2362-63, 174 L.Ed.2d at 83.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-6\">The <em>Yeager </em>Court reversed the decision of the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, which had concluded that the apparent inconsistencies between the acquittals and the hung counts meant that the Government was not precluded from re-trying Yeager on the hung counts. The Court reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b634-7\">A hung count is not a \"relevant\u201d part of the \"record of [the] prior proceeding.\u201d <em>See Ashe, </em>397 U.S., at 444, 90 S.Ct. 1189, 25 L.Ed.2d 469 (internal quotation marks omitted). Because a jury speaks only through its verdict, its failure to reach a verdict cannot\u2014by negative implication\u2014yield a piece of information that helps put together the trial puzzle. A mistried count is therefore nothing like the other forms of record material that <em>Ashe </em>suggested should be part of the preclusion inquiry.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b634-8\"><em>Yeager, </em>129 S.Ct. at 2367, 174 L.Ed.2d at 89 (alteration in the original). <em>Yeager </em>is relevant to the present case only insofar as the Supreme Court reaffirmed the collateral estoppel doctrine, as defined in <em>Ashe.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b638-8\">. We noted in <em>Ayers </em>that, in some prior cases, ''[w]e have commented that other crimes evidence is inadmissible because it is irrelevant.

Our approach in that case was to treat the offenses set forth in each of the indictments as independent of the crimes charged in the other indictments, thereby triggering an \"other crimes evidence\u201d analysis. 287 Md. at 711, 415 A.2d at 838. By application of that analysis, we concluded that the \"other crimes\u201d at issue came within what we characterized as an \"exception\u201d to the general prohibition of other crimes evidence. That \"exception permits the admission of evidence of other crimes when the several offenses are so connected or blended in point of time or circumstances that they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>form one transaction, and cannot be fully shown or explained without proving the others.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 712, 415 A.2d at 839.

All of the crimes charged in the three indictments that were at issue in that case were part of the same criminal transaction and, for the same reasons we gave in <em>Tichnell, </em>were intrinsic to one another and therefore not \"other crimes,\u201d as that phrase is employed in Maryland Rule 5--404(b).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
