The latter provisions provide the procedures for mutual and unilateral waiver of arbitration, respectively. Appellants/Cross-Petitioners (Norman A. Lockshin, M.D., P.A., and Dr. Michael Albert) urge this Court to reach a different conclusion under the plain meaning of the statute or, alternatively, to find ambiguity in the language of \u00a7 3-2A-09(a) and to examine the legislative history of the statute, which they maintain supports the conclusion that the General Assembly intended the non-economic damages cap to apply to all health care malpractice claims, not just those that are arbitrated. Appellees/Petitioners (the Estate of Richard H. Semsker, Barbara S. Semsker, Meryl Semsker, ancl Julia Semsker), on the other hand, maintain that the Circuit Court correctly determined the plain meaning of \u00a7 3-2A-09(a). For reasons we shall explain, although we agree with the Circuit Court\u2019s conclusion that the language in \u00a7 3-2A-09(a) is plain, unlike the Circuit Court, we hold that the plain meaning of that language provides that the cap on non-economic damages applies to all health care malpractice claims, including those, like the present case, for which arbitration has been waived under \u00a7 3-2A-06B.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-5\">\n<em>I. The Statutory Scheme Governing Health Care Malpractice Claims</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b291-6\">As it illuminates and informs our later analysis, it is desirable to frame early in this opinion the relevant statutory scheme in which the question at hand is enmeshed.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-7\">Subtitle 3-2A of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article governs nearly all claims brought by plaintiffs against health care providers for medical injuries alleged to have been suffered by the plaintiffs at the hands of the providers. \u00a7 3-2A-02(a)(1). The subtitle establishes the Health Care Alternative <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>Dispute Resolution Office (the \u201cHCADRO\u201d) and empowers it to create panels consisting of attorneys, health care providers, and members of the public to serve, prior to litigation, as arbiters of health care malpractice claims. \u00a7\u00a7 3-2A-03 (a) and (c). Under this arbitration scheme, a plaintiff must file initially his or her claim, along with a certificate of a qualified expert attesting to the alleged departure by the defendant(s) from standards of care and causation of the plaintiffs injury by such departure, with the Director of the HCADRO, who then refers the claim to an arbitration panel. \u00a7\u00a7 3-2A-04(a)(1)\u00ae, -04(b)(1)\u00ae, and -05(a)(1). The arbitration panel reviews pertinent documents, takes testimony from the parties and their respective experts, determines the liability of the defendant or defendants, if any,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> assesses costs of the arbitration, and issues an award. \u00a7 3-2A-05(b)-(f). Following the panel\u2019s award determination, any party may apply to the arbitration panel to modify or correct its award as to liability, damages, or costs. \u00a7 3-2A-05(h).</p>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">Under \u00a7 3-2A-06(a), a party \u201cmay reject an award or the assessment of costs under an award for any reason\u201d by notifying the Director, the arbitration panel, and the other parties to the dispute, and by filing an action in the Circuit Court to nullify the award or assessment of costs. \u00a7\u00a7 3-2A-06(a) and (b)(1). Upon proper rejection of the arbitration <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>panel\u2019s award, any party may elect to have the case tried by a jury in the Circuit Court; if no party elects timely a trial by jury, the case is heard before a judge. \u00a7 3-2A-06(b)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b293-5\">At the close of the trial and upon timely request, the trier of fact \u201cshall by special verdict or specific findings itemize by category and amount any damages assessed for incurred medical expenses, rehabilitation costs, and loss of earnings.\u201d \u00a7 3-2A-06(f)(l).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The special verdict shall itemize separately any damages for any future expenses, costs, and losses. <em>Id. </em>If a verdict includes any such itemized damages for expenses, costs, and losses, \u201ca party may object to the damages as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>excessive on the ground that the plaintiff has been or will be paid, reimbursed, or indemnified to the extent and subject to the limits stated in \u00a7 3-2A-05(h)----\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>If, after reception of evidence on the objection at a hearing, the court finds that the damages are excessive on the grounds stated in \u00a7 3-2A-05(h), it may grant a new trial as to such damages or may deny a new trial if the plaintiff agrees to a remittur of the excess. \u00a7 3-2A-06(f)(3)(i).</p>\n<p id=\"b295-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>The arbitration process, however, may be avoided in the main. Under \u00a7 3-2A-06A, at any time prior to the hearing of a claim by the HCADRO, the parties \u201cmay agree mutually to waive arbitration of the claim.\u201d \u00a7 3-2A-06A(a). If the parties so agree, \u201cthe provisions of [\u00a7 3-2A-06A] then shall govern all further proceedings on the claim.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Where a case is subject to the provisions of \u00a7 3-2A-06A based on mutual waiver of arbitration, the statute provides that \u201cthe procedures of \u00a7 3-2A-06(f) of this subtitle shall apply.\u201d \u00a7 3-2A-06A(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b295-4\">In addition to mutual waiver under \u00a7 3-2A-06A, arbitration of a claim through the HCADRO \u201cmay be waived by the claimant or any defendant in accordance with\u201d \u00a7 3-2A-06B after the filing of the certificate of qualified expert required by \u00a7 3-2A-04(b). \u00a7\u00a7 3-2A-06B(a) and (b)(1). If arbitration is waived unilaterally in this fashion, \u201cthe provisions of [\u00a7 3-2A-06B] shall govern all further proceedings on any claim .... \u201d \u00a7 3-2A-06B(a). As with mutual waiver of arbitration under \u00a7 3-2A-06A, where a case is waived unilaterally out of arbitration, the statute provides that \u201cthe procedures of \u00a7 3-2A-06(f) of this subtitle shall apply.\u201d \u00a7 3-2A-06B(h).</p>\n<p id=\"b295-5\">Of particular importance to the present case, \u00a7 3-2A-09, entitled \u201cLimitation of noneconomic damages,\u201d provides a cap on non-economic damages applicable \u201cto an award under \u00a7 3-2A-05 of this subtitle or a verdict under \u00a7 3-2A-06 of this subtitle for a cause of action arising on or after January 1, 2005.\u201d \u00a7 3-2A-09(a). Subsection (b) establishes the amount of the cap, stating that \u201can award or verdict under this subtitle for noneconomic damages for a cause of action arising between January 1, 2005, and December 31, 2008, inclusive, may not exceed $650,000.\u201d \u00a7 3-2A-09(b)(l)(i). The limitation on non-economic damages contained in \u00a7 3-2A-09(b)(l)(i) increases by $15,000 yearly, beginning on 1 January 2009. \u00a7 3-2A-09(b)(l)(ii). In general, the cap applies \u201cin the aggregate to all claims for personal injury and wrongful death arising from the same medical injury, regardless of the number of claims, claimants, plaintiffs, beneficiaries, or defendants.\u201d \u00a7 3-2A-09(b)(2)(i). The statute further provides that, where <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>\u201cthere is a wrongful death action in which there are two or more claimants or beneficiaries, whether or not there is a personal injury action arising from the same medical injury, the total amount awarded for noneconomic damages for all actions may not exceed 125% of the limitation established under paragraph (1) of this subsection, regardless of the number of claims, claimants, plaintiffs, beneficiaries, or defendants.\u201d \u00a7 3-2A-09(b)(2)(ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b296-5\">Regarding the limitation on non-economic damages, \u00a7 3-2A-09 states that a jury \u201cmay not be informed of the limitation under\u201d \u00a7 3-2A-09(b). \u00a7 3-2A-09(c)(l). If the jury awards an amount for non-economic damages exceeding the limitation, the statute provides that \u201cthe court shall reduce the amount to conform to the limitation.\u201d \u00a7 3-2A-09(c)(2). In a case in which there is a personal injury action and a wrongful death action, \u201cif the total amount awarded by the jury for noneconomic damages for both actions exceeds the limitation under [\u00a7 3-2A-09(b)], the court shall reduce the award in each action proportionately so that the total award for noneconomic damages for both actions conforms to the limitation.\u201d \u00a7 3-2A-09(c)(4). Lastly, \u00a7 3-2A~09(d) provides that a \u201cverdict for past medical expenses shall be limited to: (i) [t]he total amount of past medical expenses paid by or on behalf of the plaintiff; and (ii) [t]he total amount of past medical expenses incurred but not paid by or on behalf of the plaintiff for which the plaintiff or another person on behalf of the plaintiff is obligated to pay.\u201d \u00a7 3-2A-09(d)(l).</p>\n<p id=\"b296-7\">\n<em>II. The Present Case</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b296-8\">In late 1998, Richard H. Semsker, a 44-year-old Rockville attorney, visited the dermatology offices of Norman A. Lock-shin, M.D., P.A. (\u201cLockshin, P.A.\u201d), a medical group operating under the trade name Derm Associates, P.C., in Silver Spring, upon referral from his internist, Dr. Lawrence Marcus. Semsker was seen by Dr. Norman A. Lockshin, who removed a cyst and wrote to Dr. Marcus that Semsker had a dark brown 6 millimeter nevus<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> on his back that should be excised. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>According to Semsker, neither Dr. Marcus nor Dr. Lockshin informed him of the presence of the nevus.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-4\">In September 2004, Semsker returned to Lockshin, P.A. to have cysts on his upper back examined and to undergo a full body skin check. He was examined by Dr. Michael Albert, a dermatologist employed by Lockshin, P.A., who documented two benign cysts, an atypical nevus on Semsker\u2019s upper right back, and a 1.3 centimeter congenital nevus on his lower back (the same nevus that had grown from 6 millimeters when Dr. Lockshin examined it in 1998). Dr. Albert recommended removal of the cysts and the atypical nevus, but recommended only regular monitoring of the congenital nevus, rather than its removal. As recommended, the upper-back cysts and atypical nevus were removed.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-5\">On 3 August 2006, shortly after Semsker\u2019s wife, Barbara, noticed that the nevus Dr. Albert had not recommended be removed had changed color, Semsker returned to Lockshin, P.A., where the nevus was excised by Dr. Benjamin Lockshin. Shortly afterward, it was determined that the nevus had turned into a malignant melanoma which had metastasized to dozens of lymph nodes in Semsker\u2019s groin and lower abdomen. Radiation and other treatment failed to halt further metastasis.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-6\">On 30 March 2007, Semsker and his wife filed with the Director of the HCADRO a claim under \u00a7 3-2A-04(a)(l)(i) for medical malpractice against Dr. Albert (Semsker\u2019s dermatologist); Lockshin, P.A. under its business name Derm Associates, P.C. (Dr. Albert\u2019s employer); Dr. Norman Lockshin; Dr. Kendall Hash (another employee of Lockshin, P.A.); and Dr. Marcus (Semsker\u2019s internist), alleging misdiagnosis of his cancer. Mr. and Mrs. Semsker elected to waive arbitration pursuant to \u00a7 3-2A~06B(b)(l) on 19 June 2007, and, one day later, filed in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County a complaint for medical malpractice. In the plaintiffs\u2019 Joint Pretrial Statement and a Supplement thereto, it was stipulated that they were claiming \u201cthe maximum allowable\u201d under the non-economic damages cap, \u201cwhich is $812,500.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b298-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>On 15 October 2007, while the case was pending in the Circuit Court, Semsker passed away due to his cancer. On 19 December 2007, Mrs. Semsker filed a Second Amended Complaint, converting the case to a wrongful death and survival action on behalf of Semsker\u2019s estate (for which she is the personal representative) and adding the Semskers\u2019 two adult daughters, Meryl and Julia Semsker, as plaintiffs. Prior to trial, the remaining Semskers dismissed voluntarily and with prejudice all claims against Dr. Hash.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-5\">The trial was conducted before a jury beginning on 3 November 2008. At trial, the. Semskers introduced, without objection, evidence of $415,781 in incurred medical expenses.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b298-6\">On the final day of trial, following the conclusion of the evidence, the Semskers reached a joint tortfeasor settlement with Dr. Marcus in the amount of $1 million and granted Dr. Marcus a standard <em>non-Swigert </em>joint tortfeasor release.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The purpose of the joint tortfeasor release was to provide an automatic credit to any non-settling defendants who were held liable ultimately to the Semskers in the present case, thus protecting Dr. Marcus from all future claims against him for contribution from non-settling joint tortfeasors. The release described the credit as \u201can automatic reduction of any future verdict or judgment against any non-settling tortfeasor\u201d of \u201call <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>damages ... recoverable\u201d by the Semskers \u201cto the extent of the <em>pro rata </em>share[ ] of [Dr. Marcus] or <em>pro tanto, </em>whichever is greater.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b299-5\">On 14 November 2008, the jury returned a special verdict in favor of the Semskers, finding Dr. Albert liable individually for medical malpractice. In its verdict, the jury awarded the Semskers $5,805,000 in compensatory damages, which included a total of $3 million in non-economic damages, allocated as follows: $1 million to Semsker\u2019s estate, $1 million to Mrs. Semsker, and $500,000 to each of the Semskers\u2019 daughters.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The verdict was applied by stipulation to Dr. Albert\u2019s employer, Lockshin, P.A., on a <em>respondeat superior </em>basis.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b299-6\">On 18 November 2008, the Semskers moved the Circuit Court for entry of judgment on the entire jury verdict, specifically requesting that the court not apply the \u00a7 3-2A-09 cap on non-economic damages. The court entered judgment on the jury verdict on 19 November 2008. Subsequently, the defendants found liable by the jury, Dr. Albert and Lockshin, P.A. (collectively \u201cthe Physicians\u201d), urged the court in a timely motion to apply the cap on non-economic damages contained in \u00a7 3-2A-09(b) to the verdict, to reduce the award for past medical expenses to account for those expenses that had been written off, and to conform the verdict to the evidence. The court, in that moment being of the view that the cap on non-economic damages applied to the case, reduced the cumulative non-economic damages by the sum of $2,177,500, <em>ie., </em>from $3 million to a total of $812,500, the cap limit for non-economic damages in wrongful death health care malpractice cases with multiple claimants, and entered revised judgments on that amount on 26 November 2008.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The court also reduced the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>award for past medical expenses from $500,000 to $415,871 in order to conform to the evidence presented at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-5\">The Semskers moved the Circuit Court, on 1 December 2008, to alter or amend the judgment, arguing that the cap on non-economic damages did not apply to unarbitrated claims. The Physicians filed motions requesting a new trial, remittur, and revision of the judgments based on application of the pro rata reduction called for by the release between the Semskers and Dr. Marcus. On' 20 April 2009, the Circuit Court issued an order and opinion holding that, under the purportedly clear language of \u00a7 3-2A-09(a), the cap on non-economic damages contained in \u00a7 3-2A-09 did not apply to the present case because it involved an unarbitrated claim, denying the Physicians\u2019 motion for \u00e1 new trial or remittur, and revising the judgment to reflect Dr. Marcus\u2019s pro rata joint tortfeasor contribution. In addition, the court, assuming hypothetically that the cap applied to unarbitrated claims, held that any pro rata reduction based on the joint tortfeasor settlement should be calculated prior to application of the cap, and that the Semskers could recover for past medical expenses that had been written off by Mr. Semsker\u2019s health care providers due to the Physicians\u2019 failure to adduce at trial any evidence of such \u201cwrite-offs.\u201d On 24 April 2009, the Circuit Court entered four judgments<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> in favor of the Semskers, in accordance with its 20 April order and opinion, effectively reinstating the amount of the award granted by the jury in its special verdict.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b300-6\">The Semskers and the Physicians petitioned this Court for a writ of certiorari, prior to final action on an appeal to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>Court of Special Appeals. We granted their petitions, 409 Md. 413, 975 A,2d 875 (2009), to consider the following questions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b301-5\">(1) Whether the Circuit Court erred in holding that the cap on non-economic damages in health care malpractice claims contained in \u00a7 3-2A-09 does not apply to health care malpractice claims in which arbitration has been waived under \u00a7\u00a7 3-2A-06A or 3-2A-06B?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b301-6\">(2) Whether the Circuit Court erred in holding that, if the cap does apply to claims in which arbitration has been waived, the court should apply a pro rata joint tortfeasor reduction prior to applying the limitation on non-economic damages?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b301-7\">(3) Whether the Circuit Court erred in holding that \u00a7 3-2A-09(d)(l) does not mandate a reduction of the verdict to exclude past medical expenses that were not, and will not be paid by or on behalf of, the patient, where the Physicians failed to offer evidence of those expenses at trial?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b301-8\">As the issues are solely questions of statutory interpretation, and, thus, questions of law, our review is non-deferential. <em>See Harvey v. Marshall, </em>389 Md. 243, 257, 884 A.2d 1171, 1179 (2005); <em>Davis v. Slater, </em>383 Md. 599, 604, 861 A.2d 78, 80-81 (2004); <em>Liverpool v. Baltimore Diamond Exchange, Inc., </em>369 Md. 304, 310, 799 A.2d 1264, 1267 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b301-9\">\n<em>III. Applicability of the Cap to Unarbitrated Health Care Malpractice Claims</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b301-10\">Basing its decision on what it believed to be the plain meaning of \u00a7 3-2A-09(a), the Circuit Court held that the non-economic damages cap of \u00a7 3-2A-09 did not apply to the present unarbitrated case because \u00a7 3-2A-09(a), which states that the cap is applicable to awards under \u00a7 3-2A-05 and verdicts under \u00a7 3-2A-06, makes no reference to \u00a7\u00a7 3-2A-06A or 3-2A-06B, the \u201cseparate and distinct\u201d sections governing waiver of arbitration. Although finding the language in \u00a7 3-2A-09(a) plain in its meaning, the trial court nevertheless reviewed the purpose and legislative history of \u00a7 3-2A-09(a), concluding (1) that its interpretation of \u00a7 3-2A-09(a) did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>conflict with the statute\u2019s purpose paragraph<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> because the statute as interpreted \u201cdoes impose a single restriction on awards applicable to both wrongful death and survival actions in certain medical malpractice claims,\u201d and (2) that applying the cap to unarbitrated claims would \u201cessentially reinstate the language of \u00a7 3-2A-09 that was specifically deleted and amended by the General Assembly when it enacted the final version of the bill.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> We agree with the Circuit Court that the language of \u00a7 3-2A-09(a) is pl\u00e1in. For reasons we shall explain, however, we disagree as to the plain meaning of that language and hold that the plain meaning of the reference in \u00a7 3-2A-09(a) to \u201ca verdict under \u00a7 3-2A-06\u201d includes verdicts in cases that arrive in a Maryland courthouse following a waiver of arbitration pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 3-2A-06A or 3-2A-06B.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-5\">A.

What is the Plain Meaning of \u00a7 3-2A-09(a)?</p>\n<p id=\"b305-6\">Section 3~2A-Q9(a) provides that the non-economic damages cap for health care malpractice claims is applicable \u201cto an award under \u00a7 3- -2A 05 of this subtitle or a verdict under \u00a7 3-2A-06 of this subtitle.\u201d \u00a7 3-2A~09(a). Subsection (a) makes no mention of \u00a7 3-2A-06A or \u00a7 3--2A-06B, the sections governing the procedures for waiving arbitration. The Semskers contend, and the Circuit Court found, that the omission of such mention from subsection (a) of the arbitration provisions of \u00a7\u00a7 3-2A-Q6A and 3-2A-06B must mean that, where arbitration has been waived, the cap on non-economic damages does not apply. They are mistaken.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-7\">A health care malpractice claim may arrive in a Maryland circuit court in four distinct ways. First, the claim may be fully arbitrated under the procedures of \u00a7 3-2A-05 and require nothing more from the court than confirmation of the award. \u00a7 3-2A-05. Alternatively, under \u00a7 3-2A-06, the claim may proceed through the arbitration procedures of \u00a7 3-2A-05, the award may be rejected by one of the parties in accordance with \u00a7 3-2A-06(a), and the rejecting party may file an action in a circuit court to nullify the award and proceed to trial. \u00a7\u00a7 3-2A-Q6(a) and (b). The third and fourth avenues into court for a health care malpractice claim are through waiver of arbitration under \u00a7\u00a7 3-2A-06A or 3-2A-06B, either mutually by both sides or unilaterally by the plaintiff or any defendant, respectively, and the filing of a claim in a circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-8\">It is obvious that a claim following the first path, full arbitration under \u00a7 3-2A-05, will result in \u201can award under \u00a7 3-2A-05 of this subtitle,\u201d and the cap on non-economic damages contained in \u00a7 3-2A-09 will apply. It is equally clear and undisputed that, where an arbitration award issues and a party rejects the award under \u00a7 3~2A~06(a), electing instead to proceed to trial on the claim, the resulting verdict <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>constitutes \u201ca verdict under \u00a7 3-2A-06\u201d and the cap is applicable. The question we must resolve in this case is whether the reference in \u00a7 3-2A-09(a) to \u201ca verdict under \u00a7 3-2A-06 of this subtitle\u201d encompasses resultant verdicts reached via the other two avenues for resolution of health care malpractice claims, namely, those resulting from cases that arrive in court following either mutual or unilateral waiver of arbitration under \u00a7\u00a7 3-2A-06A or 3-2A-06B, respectively.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-5\">Sections 3-2A-06A and 3-2A-06B address solely the procedures for waiving arbitration in health care malpractice claims. Due to their limited scope in outlining the procedures for waiving arbitration, the sections make no mention of verdicts, nor do they address court procedures following waiver of arbitration. Both sections, however, provide explicitly that, \u201c[i]n any case subject to this section, the procedures of \u00a7 3-2A-06(f) of this subtitle shall apply.\u201d \u00a7\u00a7 3-2A-06A(e) and 3-2A-06B(h). Thus, where a case has been waived properly out of arbitration under \u00a7\u00a7 3-2A-06A or 3-2A-06B and proceeds to trial in a circuit court, the claim is subject to the procedures of \u00a7 3-2A-06(f), which provides for itemization of the jury\u2019s verdict into specific categories, the filing of an objection to the jury\u2019s verdict based on its excessive nature, and the court\u2019s consideration and resolution of any objection. \u00a7 3-2A-06(f).</p>\n<p id=\"b306-6\">It is clear that, if a verdict is returned under the procedures of \u00a7 3-2A-06(f), it constitutes \u201ca verdict under \u00a7 3-2A-06 of this subtitle.\u201d Despite the Circuit Court\u2019s reasoning and the Semskers\u2019 argument that the verdict obtained in the present case was \u201ca verdict under \u00a7 3-2A-06B,\u201d there can be no such verdict; where arbitration is waived, according to the specific commands of \u00a7\u00a7 3-2A-06A(e) and 3-2A-06B(h), the only verdict in a health care malpractice case is one obtained in accordance with the procedures of \u00a7 3-2A-06(f) and, thus, \u201ca verdict under \u00a7 3-2A-06 of this subtitle.\u201d Regardless of whether the verdict comes after rejection of an arbitration award or waiver of arbitration, it is \u201ca verdict under \u00a7 3-2A-06 of this subtitle\u201d and is subject to the cap provided for in \u00a7 3-2A-09.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>Our conclusion that the reference in \u00a7 3-2A-09(a) to \u201ca verdict under 3-2A-06\u201d includes verdicts in cases where arbitration is waived in accordance with \u00a7\u00a7 3-2A-06A or 3-2A-06B is reinforced by the language of the subsection that follows, \u00a7 3-2A-09(b). That subsection states that \u201can award or verdict under this subtitle for non-economic damages for a cause of action arising between January 1, 2005, and December 31, 2008, inclusive, may not exceed $650,000.\u201d \u00a7 3-2A-09(b). By reference to the entirety of subtitle 3-2A, subsection (b) contemplates a cap on all non-economic damage awards and verdicts in health care malpractice cases, including those brought under \u00a7\u00a7 3-2A-05, -06, -06A, and -06B, regardless of their derivation. Thus, the language of subsection (b) supports our conclusion that the cap on non-economic damages applies to claims for which arbitration is waived under \u00a7\u00a7 3-2A-06A or 3-2A-06B.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-5\">We hold that, based on the plain meaning of \u00a7 3-2A-09 and the specific provisions of \u00a7\u00a7 3-2A-06A and 3-2A-06B referring to the procedures of \u00a7 3-2A-06(f) regarding the issuance of verdicts, the cap on non-economic damages contained in \u00a7 3-2A-09(b) applies to all health care malpractice claims, whether they are: (1) arbitrated under \u00a7 3-2A-05; (2) arbitrated, but followed by a rejection of the arbitration award under \u00a7 3-2A-06; or (3) waived out of arbitration under \u00a7\u00a7 3-2A-06A or 3-2A-06B. Thus, the cap on non-economic damages was applicable to the Semskers\u2019 claims in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-6\">C. The Legislative History of \u00a7 3-2A-09(a)</p>\n<p id=\"b307-7\">For the sake of completeness, \u201cwe may resort to legislative history to ensure that our plain language interpretation is correct.\u201d <em>Zimmer-Rubert, </em>409 Md. at 214, 973 A.2d at 241; <em>see also Shenker v. Laureate Educ., Inc., </em>411 Md. 317, 983 A.2d 408 (2009) (reviewing legislative history \u201cfor the sake of testing the validity of our construction\u201d in the context of statutory interpretation).</p>\n<p id=\"b308-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>The language of \u00a7 3-2A-09(a) at issue in this case was enacted by the General Assembly during an emergency special session called by then Governor Robert Ehrlich on 28 December 2004. The bill that emerged from that intense special session, House Bill 2, included the current language of \u00a7 3-2A-09(a), stating that the non-economic damages cap applies to \u201can award under \u00a7 3-2A-05 of this subtitle or a verdict under \u00a7 3-2A-06 of this subtitle.\u201d The initial pertinent language of the bill, as it appeared during the first and second readings in the House of Delegates, however, provided that the cap \u201capplies to a judgment under this subtitle.\u201d The Circuit Court, in its analysis, focused on the change in this wording and concluded that the amendment to \u00a7 3-2A-09 in the enacted version of House Bill 2 \u201chad the effect of narrowing the ambit of the statute from general application to all medical malpractice actions to application to only certain medical malpractice actions.\u201d Thus, the trial court apparently believed the General Assembly had \u201cdeliberately and specifically amended\u201d \u00a7 3-2A-09(a) to exclude application of the cap to cases for which arbitration had been waived under \u00a7\u00a7 3\u2014 2A-06A or 3-2A-06B.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-5\">There exists, however, a considerably more reasonable interpretation of the purpose behind the General Assembly\u2019s change in language from the initial formulation of \u00a7 3-2A-09(a) in House Bill 2 and its final enacted version\u2014clarity. Originally, \u00a7 3-2A-09(a) purportedly applied the cap on non-economic damages to \u201cjudgments.\u201d Statutorily-mandated caps, however, should be applied to reduce verdicts, which are issued by juries, rather than \u201cjudgments,\u201d which are entered by judges. A jury may not be informed of the statutory cap on damages, <em>see </em>\u00a7 3-2A-09(c)(l), and, thus, its verdict may exceed the cap and require reduction. Judges, however, are presumed to know the law and do not enter \u201cjudgments\u201d in excess of the statutory \u201ccaps.\u201d As such, the General Assembly altered the language of \u00a7 3-2A-09(a) to apply to \u201can award or a verdict,\u201d rather than to \u201cjudgments,\u201d in order to reflect the distinction between the concepts and clarify that the cap on non-economic damages is applied to the arbitration <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>award or the jury\u2019s verdict, not the judicially-entered final \u201cjudgment\u201d in the case. The Circuit Court\u2019s belief that the change represented a deliberate decision to remove from the ambit of the cap claims for which arbitration was waived under \u00a7\u00a7 3-2A-06A or 3-2A-06B, without any legislative history to suggest that the General Assembly intended such a sea change, requires a considerable leap in reasoning.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-5\">In addition, during the special session, the General Assembly added subsection (e) to \u00a7 11-108, the general cap on non-economic damages for personal injury actions. 2004 Md. Laws (Spee.Sess.), ch. 5, at 57. Subsection (e) states that \u201c[t]he provisions of this section do not apply to a verdict under Title 3, Subtitle 2A of this article for damages in which the cause of action arises on or after January 1, 2005.\u201d \u00a7 11-108(e). The amendment removed health care malpractice actions from the ambit of the general non-economic damages cap of \u00a7 11-108. If the Circuit Court\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 3-2A-09(a) were adopted, no cap would apply to health care malpractice claims for which arbitration is waived under \u00a7\u00a7 3\u2014 2A-06A or 3-2A-06B, due to the operation of \u00a7 11-108(e). Such cases would represent the only personal injury claims singled out for exemption from a cap on non-economic damages. Without any legislative history supporting this interpretation, it would be unreasonable to conclude that the General Assembly, when it clarified the language of \u00a7 3-2A-09(a), intended such a result.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-6\">As such, the' legislative history, although not conclusive) supports our holding that the non-economic damages cap contained in \u00a7 3-2A-09 applies to all health care malpractice claims, including those for which arbitration has been waived under \u00a7\u00a7 3-2A-06A or 3-2A-06B. The Circuit Court\u2019s holding to the contrary was error.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-7\">\n<em>IV. The Order of Operation of the Cap and Settlement Credit</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b309-8\">Out of an abundance of caution, the Circuit Court assumed hypothetically that the cap might be applicable to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>present case and determined that any pro rata reduction of the verdict, based on Dr. Marcus\u2019s joint tortfeasor settlement with the Semskers, should be taken into account prior to application of the non-economic damages cap.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> We reach the opposite conclusion, holding that the cap on non-economic damages must be applied to reduce the award or verdict prior to any reduction based on a joint tortfeasor settlement.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-4\">The statute governing the effect of a joint tortfeasor settlement and release is \u00a7 3-1404, entitled \u201cEffect of release on injured person\u2019s claim.\u201d That section provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b310-5\">A release by the injured person of one joint tort-feasor, whether before or after judgment, does not discharge the other tortfeasors unless the release so provides, but it reduces the claim against the .other tort-feasors in the amount of the consideration paid for the release or in any amount or proportion by which the release provides that the total claim shall be reduced, if greater than the consider-, ation paid.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b310-6\">\u00a7 3-1404. Thus, as noted by the Circuit Court, the statute defers to the language of the release for the effect of the settlement.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-7\">The release between the Semskers and Dr. Marcus acknowledged Dr. Marcus\u2019 position as a joint tortfeasor and called for a \u201cpro rata reduction of any verdict or judgment of any non-settling tortfeasor.\u201d The Circuit Court concluded that the word \u201cverdict\u201d in the release meant the verdict prior to theoretical application of the statutory cap, and that the word \u201cjudgment\u201d referred to the capped verdict. Characterizing its conclusion as \u201cfairness\u201d in giving the Semskers the \u201cbenefit of their bargain\u201d with Dr. Marcus, the Circuit Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>determined that the joint tortfeasor settlement credit would apply to the uncapped \u201cverdict,\u201d rather than the capped \u201cjudgment.\u201d We disagree with the Court\u2019s conclusion in this regard and hold that the word \u201cverdict\u201d in the release means inherently the capped verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-4\">Section 3-2A-09(b) provides that \u201can award or verdict under this subtitle for noneconomic damages for a cause of action arising between January 1, 2005, and December 31, 2008, inclusive, <em>may not exceed </em>$650,000.\u201d \u00a7 3-2A-09(b) (emphasis added). The section mandates that a jury\u2019s verdict may not exceed the statutory cap. Thus, any verdict rendered by a jury exceeding the amount of the non-economic damages cap inherently is a verdict in the amount of the cap from the moment it is rendered. Under this construction, the reference in the release to a \u201cverdict\u201d cannot mean the uncapped jury\u2019s verdict which exceeds the statutorily-mandated cap; \u00a7 3-2A-09(b) states explicitly that there can be no such verdict. As such, the \u201cverdict or judgment\u201d in this case are one in the same\u2014the amount of the jury\u2019s verdict reduced in conformity with the non-economic damages cap of \u00a7 3-2A-09(b). Thus, the appropriate order of operations is to apply first the cap to the jury\u2019s verdict for non-economic damages, followed by a credit for the joint tortfeasor settlement.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-5\">In addition, the release states that \u201c[a]ll damages arising out of the occurrence <em>recoverable </em>by the [Semskers] against anyone other than [Dr. Marcus] will be reduced as provided in [\u00a7 3-1404].\u201d (Emphasis added). Due to the application of the non-economic damages cap, the only non-economic damages <em>recoverable </em>by the Semskers from the Physicians are the damages capped by \u00a7 3-2A-09(b). This portion of the release further suggests that any pro rata credit for the joint tortfeasor settlement with Dr. Marcus will be applied only after application of the non-economic damages cap.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-6\">Had Dr. Marcus not settled with the Semskers, and had the Semskers proceeded to trial against Dr. Marcus and Dr. Albert, the cap on non-economic damages would have been applied to the total verdict, not to each defendant\u2019s pro rata <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>share of the verdict. Application of the pro rata credit for Dr. Marcus\u2019 settlement prior to application of the cap on non-economic damages would not yield a consistent outcome. Rather, such an order of operations hypothetically would enable the Semskers to recover total non-economic damages in an amount in excess of the cap, much the same as if the cap applied only to each defendant\u2019s pro rata share of non-economic damages, thus negating the purpose of the cap limiting recovery of non-economic damages. In order to preserve the effectiveness of the cap on non-economic damages and ensure that the joint tortfeasor settlement does not affect Dr. Albert\u2019s potential liability for non-economic damages, the cap must be applied prior to any pro rata credit for a joint tortfeasor settlement.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-5\">The order of operation that we hold applicable today, applying first the cap on non-economic damages followed by any credit for a joint tortfeasor settlement, has been adhered to previously by Maryland courts without exception. <em>See Franklin v. Morrison, </em>350 Md. 144, 153, 174-75, 711 A.2d 177, 182, 192-93; <em>Anne Arundel Med. Center, Inc. v. Condon, </em>102 Md.App. 408, 414, 649 A.2d 1189 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b312-6\">\n<em>V. Evidence of Write-Offs and the Collateral Source Rule</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b312-7\">The Circuit Court held that, because the Physicians failed to adduce at trial evidence of certain write-offs of past medical expenses by Mr. Semsker\u2019s health care providers, the Physicians could not avail themselves in a post-trial motion of the provisions of \u00a7 3-2A-09(d)(l), which provides that \u201c[a] verdict for past medical expenses shall be limited to: (i) [t]he total amount of past medical expenses paid by or on behalf of the plaintiff; and (ii) [t]he total amount of past medical expenses incurred but not paid by or on behalf of the plaintiff for which the plaintiff or another person on behalf of the plaintiff is obligated to pay.\u201d \u00a7 3-2A-09(d)(l). The Physicians contend that presentation of such evidence during trial would have constituted collateral source evidence contravening the dictates of the common law collateral source rule. That <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>rule permits an injured person to recover the full amount of his or her provable damages, \u201cregardless of the amount of compensation which the person has received for his [or her] injuries from sources unrelated to the tortfeasor,\u201d and generally prohibits presentation to a jury of evidence of the amount of medical expenses that have been or will be paid by health insurance. <em>Haischer v. CSX Transportation, Inc., </em>381 Md. 119, 132, 848 A.2d 620, 627 (2004) (quoting <em>Motor Vehicle Admin. v. Seidel Chevrolet, Inc., </em>326 Md. 237, 253, 604 A.2d 473, 481 (1992)). Rather, they maintain, reduction of a jury\u2019s verdict to reflect write-offs should be undertaken by the trial judge and occur during the post-verdict remittur phase.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-5\">In its determination, the Circuit Court found that \u00a7 3-2A-09(d) \u201cclearly grafts a legislative exception to the collateral source rule\u201d because, unlike subsection (c)(1), which states that juries may not be informed of the non-economic damages cap and that verdicts for non-economic damages in excess of the cap shall be reduced by the court post-verdict, subsection (d) contains no such limitations or instructions. We disagree with the trial court\u2019s conclusion and hold that evidence of write-offs by health care providers should be considered post-verdict by the court, rather than presented to the jury during trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-6\">The language of \u00a7 3-2A-09(d)(l) makes no mention of the collateral source rule, nor does it provide that evidence concerning the payment or write-off of past medical expenses must be submitted during trial for consideration by the jury. This Court long has recognized the principle of statutory interpretation that the common law will not be deemed as repealed by implication. <em>Suter v. Stuckey, </em>402 Md. 211, 232, 935 A.2d 731, 743 (2007); <em>Robinson v. State, </em>353 Md. 683, 693, 728 A.2d 698, 702 (1999). Thus, if possible, we shall strive to interpret \u00a7 3-2A-09(d) to avoid repeal or altering the application of the common law collateral source rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-7\">Section 3-2A-09(d)(l) states that verdicts for past medical expenses <em>shall </em>be limited to the total amount of past medical expenses paid by or on behalf of the plaintiff and the total <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>amount of past medical expenses incurred, but not yet paid, for which the plaintiff or another person on behalf of the plaintiff is obligated to pay. \u00a7 3-2A-09(d)(l). Thus, the section mandates that amounts written-off shall not be included in the verdict. The question, for which the statute provides no express answer, is whether consideration of write-offs falls to the jury during trial or to the judge post-verdict in remittur.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-5\">If it is for the jury to consider write-offs and reduce their verdict accordingly, it will be necessary for a defendant to introduce evidence to the jury of the actual payments made by the plaintiffs health insurers or other collateral sources. As noted <em>supra, </em>such evidence contravenes the collateral source doctrine. Adopting this interpretation would require reading \u00a7 3-2A-09(d), as the Circuit Court did here, as fashioning a legislative exception on the collateral source rule, despite the statute\u2019s omission of any reference to that rule. Alternatively, if evidence of write-offs and discounts by the plaintiffs health care providers is to be presented to the court in a post-verdict remittur setting, similar to the procedures found in \u00a7\u00a7 3-2A-05(h) and 3-2A-09(c), the collateral source doctrine is not implicated or violated. Under this interpretation, the collateral source rule and \u00a7 3-2A-09 may be harmonized such that collateral source evidence of write-offs and discounts is not presented to the jury, but to the court, after the jury has rendered its verdict. Compelled by our duties to harmonize statutory language wherever possible and avoid repeal of the common law by implication, we embrace the latter interpretation as most consistent with the legislative intent and principles of statutory interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-6\">As to the Circuit Court\u2019s contention regarding the omission from \u00a7 3-2A-09(d) of language similar to that in \u00a7 3-2A-09(c)(l) that juries not be informed of the non-economic damages cap, we note that the long-standing acceptance of the collateral source rule and its prohibition on the presentation of collateral source evidence to the jury obviates any need for the General Assembly to confirm its applicability in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>\u00a7 3-2A-09(d). Longstanding principles of the common law need no such statutory affirmation to have continuing effect. Thus, we hold that any evidence of write-offs and discounts by Mr. Semsker\u2019s health care providers properly is considered post-verdict by the court, rather than at trial to the jury. The Circuit Court erred by finding that the Physicians waived their right to reductions under \u00a7 3-2A-09(d) based on their failure to present evidence of the write-offs during the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-4\">\n<em>VI. Conclusions</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b315-5\">To summarize, we hold that: (1) the non-economic damages cap provided for in \u00a7 3-2A-09(b) applies to all health care malpractice claims brought under subtitle 3-2A, including the present case for which arbitration had been waived pursuant to \u00a7 3-2A-06B; (2) the noneconomic damages cap should be applied to the jury\u2019s verdict prior to application of the pro rata credit provided for in Dr. Marcus\u2019s joint tortfeasor settlement and release; and, (3) the Physicians did not waive their right to any potential reduction under \u00a7 3-2A-09(d) based on write-offs by Mr. Semsker\u2019s health care providers due to their failure to adduce at trial evidence of such write-offs. Our holdings rest squarely on the principles of sound statutory interpretation and track the General Assembly\u2019s intent for the consideration of health care malpractice claims. We reverse the judgment of the Circuit Court for Montgomery County and remand the case to it with directions that the court apply, in accordance with \u00a7 3-2A~09(b), the cap on non-economic damages to the verdict, prior to application of the pro rata credit based on the Semskers\u2019 joint tortfeasor settlement with Dr. Marcus, and to conduct a remittur hearing to determine the amount of any write-offs by Semsker\u2019s health care providers and reduce the judgment accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-6\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR MONTGOMERY COUNTY REVERSED; CASE REMANDED TO THAT COURT FOR FURTHER PROCEEDINGS NOT INCONSISTENT WITH THIS OPINION; COSTS TO BE PAID BY THE APPELLEES/PETITIONERS, THE SEMSKERS.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b290-13\">.
