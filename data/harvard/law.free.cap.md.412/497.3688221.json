The State\u2019s evidence, which included the victim\u2019s testimony, was sufficient to establish that Petitioner committed the rape in 1986 and committed a third-degree sex offense in 1983. Petitioner does not argue to the contrary. He does argue, however, that he is entitled to a new trial. After the Court of Special Appeals affirmed Petitioner\u2019s convictions in <em>Thompson v. State, </em>181 Md.App. 74, 955 A.2d 802 (2008), he filed a petition for <em>writ of certiorari </em>in which he presented this Court with two questions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b528-6\">I. MAY EVIDENCE OF THE [PETITIONER\u2019S] UNCHARGED JUVENILE CONDUCT BE ADMITTED IN A CRIMINAL PROSECUTION GIVEN THAT JUVENILE ADJUDICATIONS AND THE EVIDENCE THEREIN ARE INADMISSIBLE?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b528-7\">II. DOES AMENDING THE INDICTMENT TO CHARGE THAT A CRIME OCCURRED DURING A DIFFERENT TIME-FRAME AND AT A DIFFERENT LOCATION CHANGE THE CHARACTER OF THE SEXUAL OFFENSE WHEN MULTIPLE OFFENSES ARE ALLEGED?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b528-8\">We granted the petition. 406 Md. 744, 962 A.2d 371 (2008). For the reasons that follow, we answer \u201cyes\u201d to the first question and \u201cno\u201d to the second. We shall therefore affirm the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-9\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b528-10\">The record shows that Petitioner was 40 years of age when the conduct at issue was reported to a law enforcement officer. The Court of Special Appeals provided the following factual background:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b528-11\">On May 10, 2005, [the victim] then thirty-one years of age and a resident of San Diego, California, spoke by telephone with Detective Edward Scott Jones of the Baltimore City Police Department, informing him that, beginning in 1978, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>when she was approximately five years old, until 1986, when she was thirteen, she had been sexually abused by her uncle, [Petitioner], on numerous occasions. She stated that she had not previously reported any of these incidents because she had been told by a mental health counselor that \u201cit was too late\u201d to do so.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b529-5\">At trial, the court permitted [the victim] to testify about five specific instances of sexual abuse. The first of the five incidents occurred in the summer of 1978, at the Lynview home, when [the victim] was \u201capproximately five\u201d years old and appellant was fourteen years old. Because of appellant\u2019s juvenile status at that time, the State never charged appellant with any crimes associated with this incident. The second incident took place during a school vacation in 1983, when [the victim] was ten years old and appellant was nineteen and an adult. The third and fourth incidents happened during the summers of 1984 and 1985 at her grandparents\u2019 Hampstead home, when [the victim] was about eleven years of age and appellant was twenty. The charges stemming from these incidents were dismissed during trial for lack of jurisdiction. The fifth incident occurred in November 1986, when [the victim] was thirteen and was staying at the Goodnow Road apartment of appellant, who was then twenty-two.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b529-6\">With respect to the 1986 incident, [the victim] testified that it occurred while she was visiting appellant at his apartment on Goodnow Road in Baltimore City, during her Thanksgiving school break. Appellant was then living at that address with his girlfriend, Stephanie Perry. [The victim] recalled that one evening, before appellant left for work, he provided her with a shirt to sleep in and told her she could share a bed with Ms. Perry. She then recounted how later that night, when appellant returned home, he \u201cgot into bed\u201d with her and Ms. Perry and how she later awoke to find \u201chis penis inside of [her],\u201d while Ms. Perry slept.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b530-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>Over appellant\u2019s objection, the circuit court permitted [the victim] to testify that she had been sexually abused by appellant as early as 1978, at her grandparents\u2019 Lynview home, when she was \u201c[approximately five\u201d and appellant was fourteen years old. Although appellant was never charged, either as a juvenile or an adult, with any offenses stemming from this incident, the court ruled that such testimony was admissible under Maryland Rule 5-404(b). It reasoned that because \u201cthe ... testimony would involve acts by the same Defendant against the same victim ... and the acts [were] of the [same] general nature,\u201d the evidence was admissible as proof of \u201cmotive, opportunity, intent, common scheme, plan and absence of mistake or accident.\u201d [The victim] then'testified as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b530-5\">I woke up to [appellant] touching me between my legs with his hands and with his penis. It hurt. I started to whimper a little bit and I said to him that I need to go to the bathroom. I didn\u2019t need to go to the bathroom. I just wanted to remove myself from the room. I went into the [ ] bathroom and ... s[a]t on the toilet. I remember ... my feet didn\u2019t touch the floor. And I left the bathroom, [ ] I went [ ] into my aunt\u2019s room ... a different bedroom and I just laid on her floor. And then he came into the room after and asked why I didn\u2019t come back. I didn\u2019t answer and he climbed into my aunt\u2019s bed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b530-6\"><em>Thompson v. State, </em>181 Md.App. 74, 78-81, 955 A.2d 802, 806-807 (2008). (Footnotes omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b530-7\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b530-8\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-9\">Petitioner argues that he is entitled to a new trial on the ground that the Circuit Court erred in admitting into evidence the victim\u2019s testimony about the \u201cuncharged 1978 incident, which occurred when [Petitioner] was 14 years old.\u201d The Circuit Court ruled that evidence of the 1978 incident was admissible under Md. Rule 5-404(b), which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b531-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>Evidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts is not admissible to prove the character of a person in order to show action in conformity therewith. It may, however, be admissible for other purposes, such as proof of motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, common scheme or plan, knowledge, identity, or absence of mistake or accident.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b531-5\">It is clear that the ruling at issue did not violate Md. Rule 5^104(b), which codified the \u201csexual propensity\u201d exception to the general rule excluding \u201cother crimes\u201d evidence. As this Court stated in <em>Vogel v. State, </em>315 Md. 458, 554 A.2d 1231 (1989), the \u201csexual propensity\u201d exception is applicable to evidence of \u201cprior illicit sexual acts [which] are similar to the offense for which the accused is being tried and involve the same victim.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 466, 554 A.2d at 1234. Before Md. Rule 5M04(b) was adopted, this Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b531-6\">The primary policy consideration underlying the rule against other crimes evidence \u201cis that this type of evidence will prejudice the jury against the accused because of the jury\u2019s tendency to infer that the accused is a \u2018bad man\u2019 who should be punished regardless of his guilt of the charged crime, or to infer that he committed the charged crime due to a criminal disposition.\u201d Yet, in the area of sex crimes, particularly child molestation, \u201ccourts have been likely to admit proof of prior acts to show a party\u2019s conformity with past conduct.\u201d Professor McLain suggests that this relaxation of the general prohibition is \u201cprobably because the character evidence is believed to have greater probative value in those circumstances.\u201d In sex crimes cases the special relevance of the other crimes evidence that may be admissible is a criminal propensity particularized to similar sex crimes perpetrated on the same victim.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b531-7\">Thus, in a sex offense prosecution, when the State offers evidence of prior sexual criminal acts of the same type by the accused against the same victim, the law of evidence already has concluded that, in general, the probative value, as substantive evidence that the defendant committed the crime charged, outweighs the inherent prejudicial effect. The discretion exercised by the trial judge in weighing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>unfair prejudice against probative value is concerned with special features in the particular case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b532-4\"><em>Acuna v. State, </em>332 Md. 65, 75, 629 A.2d 1233, 1238 (1993) (Citations omitted). The record shows that the Circuit Court (1) was not clearly erroneous in finding that the sexual offenses committed by Petitioner against the very same victim in 1978 had been proven by \u201cclear and convincing\u201d evidence, and had \u201cspecial\u201d probative value, and (2) did not abuse its discretion in admitting that evidence on the ground that its probative value outweighed the danger of unfair \u201cbad actor\u201d prejudice against Petitioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-5\">Petitioner argues that Section 3-8A-23 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article (CJ \u00a7 3-8A-23) prohibits the State from introducing evidence of \u201ccriminal acts,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> or wrongs\u201d that were committed by an adult defendant when he or she was a juvenile. That statute, in pertinent part, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ABP\">\u00a7 3-8A-23. Effect of proceedings under [the Juvenile Causes Act] subtitle.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b532-6\">(b) <em>Adjudication and disposition not admissible as evidence.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b532-7\">An adjudication and disposition of a child pursuant to this subtitle are not admissible as evidence against the child:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b532-8\">(1) In any criminal proceeding prior to conviction; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b532-9\">(2) In any adjudicatory hearing on a petition alleging delinquency; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b533-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>(3) In any civil proceeding not conducted under this subtitle.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b533-5\">(c) Evidence given in proceeding under this subtitle inadmissible in criminal proceeding. Evidence given in a proceeding under this subtitle is not admissible against the child in any other proceeding in another court, except in a criminal proceeding where the child is charged with perjury and the evidence is relevant to that charge and is otherwise admissible.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b533-6\">According to Petitioner, because Md. Rule 5-404(b) must be read in light of the policy underlying the Juvenile Causes Act, evidence of unadjudicated juvenile acts allegedly committed by an adult defendant is inadmissible as a matter of law in subsequent criminal proceedings. Trial judges do not have discretion to admit evidence that is inadmissible as a matter of law. The issue of whether C J \u00a7 3-8A-23 \u201ctrumps\u201d Md. Rule 5-404(b) presents a question of law.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b533-7\">The State argues that the Circuit Court was correct in its conclusion that the admissibility of the evidence at issue was controlled by Md. Rule 5-404(b) because the statutory prohibition in CJ \u00a7 3-8A-23 does not apply to evidence that was never presented in a juvenile proceeding. The Court of Special Appeals agreed with that argument. So do we.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-8\">To resolve a question of law that is controlled by a statute, this Court must \u201cidentify and effectuate the legislative intent underlying the statute(s) at issue.\u201d <em>Serio v. Baltimore County, </em>384 Md. 373, 390, 863 A.2d 952, 962 (2004) (quoting <em>Drew v. First Guaranty Mortgage Corp., </em>379 Md. 318, 327, 842 A.2d 1, 6 (2003)). While this Court must be guided by the plain language of the applicable statute, we must \u201cread statutory language within the context of the statutory scheme, considering the \u2018purpose, aim, or policy of the enacting body.\u2019 \u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number><em>Serio, </em>384 Md. at 390, 863 A.2d at 962 (quoting <em>Drew, </em>379 Md. at 327, 842 A.2d at 6; citing <em>Beyer v. Morgan State Univ., </em>369 Md. 335, 349, 800 A.2d 707, 715 (2002); <em>In re Mark M., </em>365 Md. 687, 711, 782 A.2d 332, 346 (2001)).</p>\n<p id=\"b534-5\">Having applied these principles to the issue before us, we agree with the Court of Special Appeals that \u201cthe purpose and plain language of \u00a7 3-8A-23 does not provide a basis for extending its application to the uncharged juvenile misconduct in this case.\u201d <em>Thompson v. State, </em>181 Md.App. 74, 87, 955 A.2d 802, 810 (2008). \u201cA court may neither add nor delete language so as to reflect an intent not evidenced in the plain and unambiguous language of the statute; nor may it construe the statute with forced or subtle interpretations that limit or extend its application.\u201d <em>Price v. State, </em>378 Md. 378, 387, 835 A.2d 1221, 1226 (2003). \u201cJuvenile proceedings are governed by a separate, pervasive scheme of specific statutes and rules developed by the Maryland General Assembly and the Court of Appeals.\u201d <em>In re Victor B., </em>336 Md. 85, 96, 646 A.2d 1012, 1017 (1994). If the General Assembly intended to exclude evidence of other crimes allegedly committed by an adult defendant when the defendant was a juvenile, but never presented in a juvenile court proceeding, the General Assembly would certainly have placed that restriction in CJ \u00a7 3-8A-23. We therefore conclude that the admissibility of the evidence at issue is controlled by Md. Rule 5M:04(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b534-6\">Our conclusion is consistent with the holding of <em>State v. Shedrick, </em>61 Ohio St.3d 331, 574 N.E.2d 1065 (1991), in which the Supreme Court of Ohio was presented with two conflicting interpretations of a statute that, prior to July 1, 1992,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b535-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>\u201cThe judgment rendered by the court under this chapter shall not impose any of the civil disabilities ordinarily imposed by conviction of a crime in that the child is not a criminal by reason of the adjudication, nor shall any child be charged or convicted of a crime in any court except as provided by this chapter. The disposition of a child under the judgment rendered or any evidence given in court is not admissible as evidence against the child in any other case or proceeding in any other court, except that the judgment rendered and the disposition of the child may be considered by any court only as to the matter of sentence or to the granting of probation. The disposition or evidence shall not operate to disqualify a child in any future civil service examination, appointment, or application.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b535-5\">R.C. 2151.358(H) (Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b535-6\">In the Common Pleas Court of Summit County, Ohio, a jury convicted Donald Shedrick of the aggravated murder and rape of a thirteen year old girl, Lori E., whose body was discovered on December 15, 1988. The State\u2019s case against Shedrick included evidence that, in 1987, he raped a thirteen year old girl, Christine Y. Shedrick noted an appeal to the Court of Appeals of the Ninth Appellate District, and presented that Court with two assignments of error:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b535-7\">ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR I</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b535-8\">\u201cThe trial court erred in admitted evidence of prior acts of the defendant when such evidence and such acts had been the subject of a prior juvenile court adjudication.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b535-9\">ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR II</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b535-10\">\u201cThe trial court erred in allowing the admission of prior acts of the defendant to prove identity, plan, scheme or design.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b536-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>A divided three-judge panel of the intermediate appellate court held that neither assignment was \u201cwell taken,\u201d and that the judgment of the trial court should be affirmed. That panel, however, (1) acknowledged that the majority\u2019s disposition of the first assignment of error was \u201cin conflict with the judgment upon the same question by the Court of Appeals of the Eighth Appellate District,\u201d (2) concluded that this conflict should be resolved by the Supreme Court of Ohio, and (3) therefore entered a JOURNAL ENTRY that included the following provisions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b536-4\">The question of law upon which the conflict of opinion exists is whether a person who testified in a juvenile court proceeding is precluded by R.C. 2151.358(h) from testifying on the same subject in any other case or proceeding in any other court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b536-5\">Therefore, the record of <em>State v. Shedrick </em>... is hereby certified to the Supreme Court of Ohio for review and final determination.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b536-6\">While holding that a remand was necessary to determine whether the evidence of the 1987 rape should have been excluded on the ground that the witnesses who testified about that crime (Christine Y., Christine\u2019s mother, and a detective who investigated the 1987 case) had previously testified against Shedrick in juvenile court, the Supreme Court of Ohio (1) explained what constitutes \u201cevidence given in [juvenile] court,\u201d and (2) rejected Shedriek\u2019s argument that the evidence of the 1987 rape should have been excluded under Rule 404(B) of the Ohio Rules of Evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-7\">On the issue of what does\u2014and does not\u2014constitute \u201cevidence given in [juvenile] court,\u201d the Supreme Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b536-8\">When evidence is given in the form of testimony, it is the essential subject matter of the testimony which constitutes the evidence and not the precise words used. The transcript is not the \u201cevidence,\u201d but only a record of the evidence. Therefore, where a witness has testified in a juvenile proceeding, R.C. 2151.358(H) prohibits that witness from giving essentially the same testimony in any other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>criminal case or criminal proceeding. Accordingly we hold that, under R.C. 2151.358(H), testimony, documents, or exhibits, presented as evidence against a juvenile in a juvenile proceeding, are inadmissible against the juvenile in any other criminal case or criminal proceeding except ones in which the same underlying alleged crime is being adjudicated.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b537-5\">Our interpretation of R.C. 2151.358(H) does not end the inquiry necessary to decide this case. Appellant argues that the \u201cspirit\u201d of R.C. 2151.358(H) precludes the use of any evidence which formed the basis of prior juvenile disposition. ... Appellant argues that even if he pled guilty to the allegations of a juvenile complaint, any evidence which could have been used against him is inadmissible in a subsequent case....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b537-6\">We do not agree. This argument is also resolved by the language of R.C. 2151.358(H). The language is unambiguous in its prohibition against \u201cany evidence given in [juvenile] court.\u201d The statute does not exclude evidence that might have been given in juvenile court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b537-7\">Because of the discrepancy between the facts represented by state\u2019s counsel at oral argument and the facts suggested by the record, we must remand the case to the trial court for a disposition in accordance with the law as we have set it forth. If C.Y., her mother, or [the officer who investigated the 1987 case] testified at the juvenile proceeding, then R.C. 2151.358(H) bars the testimony of those witnesses in this case to the extent that such testimony is essentially the same as that previously given. On the other hand, if any one of these three witnesses did not testify at the juvenile proceeding or if their testimony in the instant case was not essentially the same, then such testimony would be admissible in the instant case. Finally, if evidence was admitted in this case in violation of R.C. 2151.358(H), the trial court must determine whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>the effect was prejudicial and whether a new trial is warranted for Shedrick.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b538-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 1068-69. (Emphasis supplied; footnote omitted).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b538-6\">As to Shedrick\u2019s argument that evidence of the 1987 rape should have been excluded under Rule 404(B) of the Ohio Rules of Evidence, the Supreme Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b538-7\">In the case before us the identity of the perpetrator is at issue because Shedrick denies that [he committed the crime]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b538-8\">... We conclude the similarities between the two crimes is sufficient. The evidence of the first rape tends to show the identity of the perpetrator of the second. Therefore, evidence of Shedrick\u2019s prior rape of C.Y. meets the requirements for admission set by Evid. R. 404(B) and R.C. 2945.59 [notwithstanding that the defendant was a juvenile].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b538-9\"><em>Id. </em>at 1070.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-10\">Our conclusion is also consistent with the holdings of <em>State v. Collier, </em>892 S.W.2d 686 (Mo.App. W.D.1994), and <em>People v. Whittington, </em>74 Cal.App.3d 806, 141 Cal.Rptr. 742 (1977). In <em>Collier, </em>while affirming a murder conviction, the Court of Appeals of Missouri held that a statute similar to \u00a7 3-8A-23 did not prohibit the State from introducing evidence of the defendant\u2019s uncharged juvenile misconduct. The <em>Collier </em>Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b538-11\">Although the defendant was a minor when the above incidents of burglary and robbery occurred, it appears that he was never subjected to juvenile proceedings for any of them.

I will moreover note that the defense has been aware of the location variance since before trial, because it was told to me prior to trial that her testimony with respect <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>to the 1986 events [would be] that they occurred at [the] Goodnow Road [location] and not at the Lynview Avenue location.

Although the victim was unable to provide Detective Wortz with the exact address, she stated that the 1986 offenses occurred at the \u201cstudio apartment type of thing\u201d where Petitioner was living at that time. Prior to the date of his indictments, Petitioner was arrested on a warrant issued by a District Court Commissioner, who was presented with an Application for Statement of Charges that included the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b543-6\">APPLICATION FOR STATEMENT OF CHARGES</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b543-7\">I, [Detective Jones], apply for a statement of charges and a summons or warrant which may lead to the arrest of the named Defendant because on or about 1 Jan. 79-31 Dec. 86 at 5429 Lynview Ave. Baltimore Md. 21215 and 5105 Good-now Rd.

Consequently, the only change to an indictment that requires the consent of the parties is one that would alter the elements of the crime charged. And, thus, \u201c[a]n indictment may be corrected without the defendant\u2019s consent if the amendment does not alter any of the elements of the offense and results in no prejudice.\u201d <em>Tapscott, </em>106 Md.App. at 134[, 664 A.2d at 54].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b544-8\">We have repeatedly held that the date that an indictment alleges that the criminal conduct occurred \u201cmay be amended in the court\u2019s discretion without changing the character of the offense.\u201d <em>Manuel [v.

Thus, the circuit court did not abuse its discretion in amending the date stated in the indictment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b545-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>Nor does the amendment changing the location of the conduct charged from one address to another within Baltimore City change the character of the offense charged. In <em>Makins v.

We explained: \u201cThe incident as drawn clearly charged the appellant with the crime of daytime housebreaking with intent to steal the personal goods of another. Each of the elements of that crime was alleged, without regard to the particular apartment number specified, and none of the essential elements of the offense were changed by the amendment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(Internal citation omitted). The same reasoning applies here. The indictment set forth the elements of the offense charged without regard to the particular house address, and therefore, \u201cnone of the essential elements of the offense were changed\u201d by the amendment of the address.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b545-5\"><em>Thompson v.

State, </em>237 Md. 486, 206 A.2d 809 (1965), in which this Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b545-7\">As to what constitutes substance and what is merely formal in an indictment, it may be said that all facts which must be proved to make the act complained of a crime are matters of substance, and that all else\u2014including the order of arrangement and precise words, unless they alone will convey the proper meaning\u2014is formal.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b545-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 489-90, 206 A.2d at 811. An amendment that constitutes merely a \u201cmatter of form\u201d does not change the character of the offense. <em>Johnson v.

The charge as amended required proof of an arrest while the original charge did not. Thus, the basic description of the offense charged was changed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b546-8\">Because the amendment changed the character of the offense originally charged, it was not a matter of form. The petitioner did not consent to the amendment, and it is, therefore, impermissible.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b546-9\"><em>Id. </em>at 679, 426 A.2d at 959. In <em>Johnson, supra, </em>while holding that the State should not have been permitted to substitute \u201ccocaine\u201d for \u201cmarijuana\u201d in a criminal information charging violations of the Maryland Controlled Dangerous Substances Act, this Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b546-10\">[A]s in <em>Thanos [v.

The information initially accused the defendant of possessing marijuana, whereas the amended information charged an entirely different act, possessing crack cocaine.

The record also shows that, prior to trial, Petitioner\u2019s trial counsel was provided with a copy of the victim\u2019s statement to Detective Wortz. Because the discovery provided by the State made it clear that the 1986 incident occurred in November of that year at the Goodnow Road address, Petitioner is not entitled to a new trial on the ground that he was unfairly prejudiced by the amendments at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-6\">JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS AFFIRMED.

At Thompson\u2019s trial, over defense counsel\u2019s objection, the court permitted the prosecutor to present evidence of uncharged sexual offenses that Thompson allegedly committed against Ms. Timm in the summer of 1978, when Ms. Timm was age five and Thompson was age 14. The Circuit Court reasoned that evidence of the 1978 incident was admissible under Md. Rule 5-404(b) to prove motive, opportunity, intent, or common scheme.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-7\">Ms. Timm testified that Thompson sexu\u00e1lly abused her at her grandparents\u2019 home in 1978. She stated, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b548-8\">I woke up to [Thompson] touching me between my legs with his hands and with his penis. It hurt. I started to whimper a little bit and I said to him that I need to go to the bathroom. I didn\u2019t need to go to the bathroom. I just wanted to remove myself from the room. I went into the bathroom' and ... sat on the toilet. I remember ... my feet didn\u2019t touch the floor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b548-9\">And I left the bathroom, I went into my aunt\u2019s room ... a different bedroom and I just laid on her floor. And then he came into the room after and asked why I didn\u2019t come back. I didn\u2019t answer and he climbed into my aunt\u2019s bed....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b548-10\">Ms. Timm also testified about four incidents that occurred after 1978. Regarding an incident that occurred in 1983, she testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b548-11\">My mother and I drove to Maryland ... to visit. The whole family was there, I remember a very full house ... we slept in [Thompson\u2019s] room.... And there were a lot of other people in the room....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b549-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>Everyone was going to sleep and [Thompson] kept saying my mother\u2019s name, Linda, are you asleep? ...

He was inserting his fingers between my legs.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b549-5\">Ms. Timm testified that, in 1986, during her Thanksgiving school break, she visited Thompson at his apartment in Baltimore. Ms. Timm stated that before Thompson left for work one day, Thompson told her that she could sleep in his bed with his girlfriend, Stephanie Perry. Ms. Timm stated that she awoke that night to find \u201c[Thompson\u2019s] penis inside of [her].\u201d On July 11, 2006, the jury rendered several guilty verdicts. With respect to the incident occurring in 1983, the jury found Thompson guilty of third-degree and fourth-degree sex offenses; the jury also found the petitioner guilty of second-degree rape, third-degree and fourth-degree sexual offenses, as well as second-degree assault, for the incident in 1986. The court sentenced Thompson to 20 years incarceration.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-6\">Thompson appealed his convictions to the Court of Special Appeals, which affirmed the judgments entered below. <em>Thompson v. State, </em>181 Md.App. 74, 955 A.2d 802 (2008). The intermediate appellate court held that the 1978 incident was admissible into evidence pursuant to Maryland Rule 5~404(b).

This section also states that this subtitle, of which \u00a7 3-8A-23 is a part, \u201cshall be liberally construed to effectuate these purposes.\u201d \u00a7 3-8A-02(b) of the Courts &amp; Judicial Proceedings Article; <em>see also In re Leslie </em>M., 305 Md. 477, 482, 505 A.2d 504, 507 (1986) (rejecting a \u201crestrictive\u201d reading of former Maryland Rule 916 due to the \u201cliberal statutory construction\u201d required by the Juvenile Causes Act).</p>\n<p id=\"b552-14\">In the case <em>sub judice, </em>Thompson contends that the Circuit Court erred in admitting into evidence testimony concerning the uncharged 1978 incident, which occurred when Thompson was 14 years old. According to Thompson, Md. Rule 5^404(b) must be read in light of the policy underlying the Juvenile <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>Causes Act, and that, under such a construction, evidence of unadjudicated juvenile acts is not admissible in subsequent criminal proceedings as a matter of law. The State argues to the contrary, maintaining that the Circuit Court acted within its discretion in admitting into evidence the acts committed by Thompson when he was a juvenile. The majority concludes that \u00a7 3-8A-23 does not apply to testimony presented by the State in the prosecution of Thompson for criminal offenses because the evidence was admissible under Md. Rule 5-404(b) and had never been \u201cgiven\u201d in a juvenile proceeding. I disagree with that holding primarily because of the statutory mandate that \u00a7 3-8A-23 should be construed liberally.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-5\">First, the determination of whether there exists an exception to Md. Rule 5-404(b) is a matter of law not within the trial judge\u2019s discretion. <em>Faulkner, </em>314 Md. at 634, 552 A.2d at 898. Similarly, the determination of whether an act is exempt from the purview of Rule 5-404(b) is a questions of law and not a matter of discretion. <em>See Figgins v. Cochrane, </em>403 Md. 392, 942 A.2d 736 (2008) (explaining that we review the determination of whether evidence must be excluded as a matter of law) (quoting <em>Hall v. Univ. of Md. Med. Sys. Corp., </em>398 Md. 67, 82-83, 919 A.2d 1177, 1186 (2007)).</p>\n<p id=\"b553-6\">Because the determination that the existence of an exemption to Md. Rule 5-404(b) is a legal determination, we should consider whether the trial judge erred in admitting into evidence testimony about the alleged sexual assault by Thompson in 1978. As explained, Thompson argues that \u00a7 3-8A-23 of the Courts and Proceedings Article provides the applicable evidentiary exemption. We should therefore interpret the language of that statute to determine whether it does, in fact, apply to the testimony at issue in this case. In considering the Juvenile Causes Act, we construe this statutory language liberally to effectuate the purposes of the Act. \u00a7 3-8A-02(b) of the Courts and Proceedings Article. With that requirement in mind, our goal is to \u201cidentify and effectuate the legislative intent underlying the statute(s) at issue.\u201d <em>Serio v. Baltimore County, </em>384 Md. 373, 863 A.2d 952, 962 (2004) (quoting <em>Drew v.

The statute\u2019s plain language is the best source of legislative intent, and that language guides our understanding of this intent, but we do not read the plain language of a statute in a vacuum. <em>Serio, </em>384 Md. at 373, 863 A.2d at 962 (citing <em>Drew, </em>379 Md. at 327, 842 A.2d at 6; <em>Derry v. State, </em>358 Md. 325, 336, 748 A.2d 478, 483-84 (2000)). We should instead \u201cread the statutory language within the context of the statutory scheme, considering the \u2018purpose, aim, or policy of the enacting body.\u2019 \u201d <em>Serio, </em>384 Md. at 373, 863 A.2d at 962 (quoting <em>Drew, </em>379 Md. at 327, 842 A.2d at 6; citing <em>Beyer v.

As we have stated,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AAu\">when we pursue the context of statutory language, we are not limited to the words of the statute as they are printed---- We may and often must consider other \u201cexternal manifestations\u201d or \u201cpersuasive evidence,\u201d including a bill\u2019s title and function paragraphs ... and other material that fairly bears on the fundamental issue of legislative purpose or goal, which becomes the context within which we read the particular language before us in a given case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b554-6\"><em>Williams v.

Mayor of Baltimore, </em>309 Md. 505, 514-15, 525 A.2d 628, 632-33 (1987)).</p>\n<p id=\"b554-7\">With these rules guiding my analysis, I interpret the statute at hand differently than the majority. In my view, if Thompson\u2019s juvenile conduct had been adjudicated in a juvenile proceeding, \u00a7 3-8A-23 of the Juvenile Causes Act would have precluded admission of the adjudication into evidence, as well as any evidence given in the juvenile proceeding from admission in the criminal proceedings below. Inde\u00e9d, it is clear that the Legislature intended for juvenile adjudications of delinquent acts to be wholly separate from the criminal justice system. \u00a7 3-8A-23(a) of the Courts &amp; Judicial Proceedings Article (\u201cAn adjudication of a child pursuant to this subtitle is not a criminal conviction for any purpose and does not impose any of the civil disabilities ordinarily imposed by a criminal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>conviction.\u201d); <em>see also </em>Md.Code C.J. \u00a7 3-8A-01(\u00a3) (defining a delinquent act as an act that \u201cwould be a crime if committed by an adult\u201d); <em>In re Alexander, </em>16 Md.App. 416, 420, 297 A.2d 301, 303 (1972) (\u201cWe hold that it was the plain legislative intent that a finding of delinquency in a juvenile court should not be equated in any way with a conviction for crime.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b555-5\">The fact that \u00a7 3-8A-23 of the Juvenile Causes Act uses the terms \u201cadjudicate\u201d and \u201cdisposition,\u201d however, does not mean that unadjudicated conduct is excluded from the prohibition\u2019s purview. Construing \u00a7 3-8A-23 to apply only to juvenile adjudications is inconsistent with the \u201clegislative purpose or goal\u201d underlying the Juvenile Causes Act, <em>see Williams, </em>359 Md. at 116, 753 A.2d at 49, and it contradicts the basic cannon of statutory interpretation that a court should \u201cavoid a construction of [a] statute that is unreasonable, illogical, or inconsistent with common sense,\u2019 \u201d <em>Walzer v. Osborne, </em>395 Md. 563, 573, 911 A.2d 427, 432 (2006) (quoting <em>Blake v. State, </em>395 Md. 213, 224, 909 A.2d 1020, 1026 (2006)). For a juvenile to be found involved and adjudicated delinquent in a juvenile proceeding the State must prove, beyond a reasonable doubt, the conduct giving rise to the juvenile act. Md.Code (1973, 2006 RepLVol.), \u00a7 3-8A-18(c) of the Courts &amp; Judicial Proceedings Article. Under Rule 5-404(b), however, the State is only required to prove the conduct classified as a crime, wrong, or bad act by a lesser standard, clear and convincing evidence. <em>Faulkner, </em>314 Md. at 634, 552 A.2d at 898. Considering the lower standard of proof under 5-404(b), it would be unreasonable to construe the Juvenile Causes Act as merely precluding the admission of adjudicated juvenile conduct in a subsequent criminal proceeding. Under such a construction, the State could decline to have a juvenile\u2019s conduct adjudicated before the juvenile reached age 18, but then introduce that same conduct in a criminal proceeding after the juvenile has turned age 18 or older. The State would then only need to prove the juvenile conduct by clear and convincing evidence, a lesser standard than the Legislature has expressly required for establishing a juvenile delinquent act. <em>See </em>\u00a7 3-8A-18(c)(i) of the Courts <em>&amp; </em>Judicial Proceedings Article (adopting the stan<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>dard of reasonable doubt to prove that a juvenile committed a delinquent act); <em>In re Winship, </em>397 U.S. 358, 368, 90 S.Ct. 1068, 1075, 25 L.Ed.2d 368 (1970) (acknowledging that reasonable doubt is a constitutional safeguard applicable to the adjudicatory stage of a delinquency proceeding).</p>\n<p id=\"b556-5\">This interpretation of \u00a7 3-8A-23 is untenable. Such an interpretation would allow the State to use Rule 5-404(b) as a way of keeping juveniles out of the juvenile justice system, thereby allowing the State to defeat the Legislature\u2019s intent in creating a separate system for the adjudication of juveniles. The explicit purposes underlying the Juvenile Causes Act include rehabilitating and protecting juveniles, developing juveniles\u2019 competency and character, holding parents accountable, and strengthening family ties. \u00a7 3-8A-02(a) of the Courts &amp; Judicial Proceedings Article. We, therefore, should liberally construe the provisions of the Juvenile Causes Act, including \u00a7 3-8A-23, to effectuate these purposes. \u00a7 3-8A-02(b) of the Courts &amp; Judicial Proceedings Article. The juvenile justice system cannot achieve any of these purposes if the State diverts juveniles from that system when they commit delinquent acts. Accordingly, we should construe \u00a7 3-8A-23 in a way that ensures that the State will direct juveniles to the juvenile justice system when appropriate. By construing the statute to make inadmissible, in a criminal court, evidence of unadjudicated delinquent acts to the same extent as adjudicated delinquent acts, we would ensure that the State cannot bring these acts to the attention of a criminal court when the appropriate venue was the juvenile justice system. Any other interpretation would permit a subversion of the juvenile justices system and thereby eviscerate the Juvenile Causes Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-6\">Second, the majority\u2019s and the State\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 3-8A-23 of the Courts &amp; Judicial Proceedings Article contradicts another basic cannon of statutory interpretation: that \u201c[w]hen construing a provision that is part of a single statutory scheme, the legislative intent must be gathered from the entire statute, rather than from only one part.\u201d <em>Jones v. State, </em>311 Md. 398, 405, 535 A.2d 471, 474 (1988). Each provision of the Juvenile Causes Act therefore \u201cmust be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>harmonized both with its immediate context and with the larger context of the entire Juvenile Causes Act.\u201d <em>Jones, </em>311 Md. at 405, 535 A.2d at 475 (1988). With the Juvenile Causes Act, the Legislature set forth a statutory scheme that dictates that juvenile acts should be considered by particular courts. For example, the Legislature has decided that the Juvenile Court lacks original jurisdiction in some circumstances. \u00a7 3-8A-03(d) of the Courts &amp; Judicial Proceedings Article. In addition, the Legislature has identified certain circumstances where the Juvenile Court may waive jurisdiction in favor of a criminal court. \u00a7 3-8A-06 of the Courts &amp; Judicial Proceedings Article. The Legislature has also created a procedure by which a criminal court may transfer some cases to the Juvenile Court, after considering a variety of specified factors. \u00a7 3-8A-03(d)(l),(4),(5) of the Courts &amp; Judicial Proceedings Article; <em>see also </em>Md.Code (1974, 2008 RepLVol.), \u00a7 4-202 of the Criminal Procedures Article (providing factors the criminal court must consider in transferring cases to the Juvenile Court). These provisions of the Juvenile Causes Act set forth the limited circumstances where juvenile conduct may come before a criminal court, and we should construe \u00a7 3-8A-23 to prohibit the State from creating an additional method for doing so.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-5\">Indeed, we have previously said that the lower courts must adhere to the waiver and jurisdiction provisions of the Juvenile Causes Act in regard to delinquent acts committed by individuals who have subsequently reached adulthood. In <em>In re Appeals No. 1022 &amp; No. 1081, </em>278 Md. 174, 176, 359 A.2d 556, 558 (1976), the Juvenile Court had determined that waiver was not warranted in regard to a case involving an adult who had committed a delinquent act while still a juvenile. The court then dismissed the case for lack of jurisdiction over the adult, pursuant to the statute that is now codified as \u00a7 3-8A-07(e) of the Courts and Proceedings Act. <em>Id. </em>On appeal, we agreed with the Juvenile Court and rejected the State\u2019s argument that waiver was mandatory in such a case. <em>In re Appeals, </em>278 Md. 174, 178-79, 359 A.2d 556, 559-60. We held instead that a waiver hearing must be conducted before a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>criminal court may consider a delinquent act, even if the person who committed the act subsequently reached adulthood. <em>In re Appeals, 278 </em>Md. at 178-79, 359 A.2d at 559-60. In other words, absent a waiver hearing and determination that jurisdiction over an adult who allegedly committed a delinquent act as a juvenile should be waived, a criminal court cannot consider the alleged delinquent act. Relying on <em>In re Appeals, </em>recently the Court of Special Appeals reached the same conclusion in a similar case. <em>In re Saifu K., </em>187 Md.App. 395, 978 A.2d 881 (2009) (rejecting the State\u2019s argument that the Juvenile Court was required to waive its jurisdiction when the defendant had allegedly committed a delinquent act at age 14, but a petition was not served on him until he had reached age 21). In the case <em>sub judice, </em>I would similarly construe \u00a7 3-8A-23 to ensure that criminal courts do not consider delinquent acts absent adherence to the waiver and jurisdiction procedures of the Juvenile Causes Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-4\">Third, we should liberally construe \u00a7 3-8A-23 of the Courts &amp; Judicial Proceedings Article \u201creasonably with reference to its purpose, aim, [and] policy.\u201d <em>In re Keith G., </em>325 Md. 538, 542, 601 A.2d 1107, 1109 (1992). As the foregoing makes clear, the General Assembly\u2019s aim, in enacting the Juvenile Causes Act, was for juvenile acts, in most instances, to be wholly separate from the criminal justice system. Moreover, the well-established purpose underlying the Juvenile Causes Act is to rehabilitate juvenile offenders. <em>See, e, g., In re Julianna B., </em>179 Md.App. 512, 574, 947 A.2d 90, 126-27 (2008) (\u201c[The appellate courts] have repeatedly noted that the Legislature intended the juvenile justice system to be \u2018guided generally by principles of protection and rehabilitation of the individual rather than a societal goal of retribution and punishment.\u2019 \u201d) (quoting <em>Smith v. State, </em>399 Md. 565, 580, 924 A.2d 1175 (2007)), <em>vacated on other grounds, </em>407 Md. 657, 967 A.2d 776 (2009); <em>Lopez-Sanchez v. State, </em>155 Md.App. 580, 598, 843 A.2d 915 (2004) (\u201cThe General Assembly enacted the Juvenile Causes Act ... to advance its purpose of rehabilitating the juveniles who have transgressed____\u201d). That \u00a7 3-8A-23 of the Courts &amp; Judicial Proceedings Article effectively prevents <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>a prosecutor from using a juvenile\u2019s adjudicated delinquent acts against him in a later criminal proceeding is indeed evident of the General Assembly\u2019s broad policy of distinguishing between juvenile transgressions and those acts that should be brought before the criminal justice system.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-5\">From the exclusion of charged juvenile conduct in subsequent criminal proceedings pursuant to \u00a7 3-8A-23 of the Courts &amp; Judicial Proceedings Article, it necessarily follows that the Legislature intended to grant the same protections to uncharged juvenile conduct. It is plainly inconsistent with the underlying policy and overall scheme of the Juvenile Causes Act to admit as evidence, in a criminal case, the unadjudicated delinquent acts of a juvenile when those same acts, if determined by the Juvenile Court to have been delinquent, would not have been admitted as evidence in a criminal case. Accordingly, there is no sound justification for distinguishing between the unadjudicated delinquent acts of a juvenile offender and the adjudicated delinquent acts of a juvenile offender for purposes of the admissibility of evidence in a criminal case. Both acts are not admissible into evidence in a criminal case. Therefore, I would hold that, under Maryland law, juvenile acts are not legislatively deemed to be \u201ccrimes, wrongs, or acts\u201d within the meaning of Rule 5^104(b), because the General Assembly has determined that the acts are irrelevant in a criminal prosecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-6\">In holding that evidence of unadjudicated juvenile conduct is inadmissible in subsequent criminal proceedings to the extent that adjudicated conduct is precluded pursuant to \u00a7 3-8A-23 of the Courts &amp; Judicial Proceedings Article, such a holding would be consistent with the concerns expressed by the court in <em>State v. Dixon, </em>656 S.W.2d 49 (Tenn.Crim.App.1983). In <em>Dixon, </em>the Criminal Court of Appeals of Tennessee rejected the prosecution\u2019s argument that \u201cbad acts\u201d of a juvenile were distinguishable from juvenile adjudications. <em>Dixon, </em>656 S.W.2d at 52. Although the court found that the admission of juvenile acts was harmless error, it noted that allowing the juvenile \u201cbad acts\u201d into evidence would enable the State to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>circumvent Federal Rule of Evidence 609(d).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Dixon, </em>656 S.W.2d at 52. Like \u00a7 3-8A-23 of the Courts &amp; Judicial Proceedings Article, Federal Rule of Evidence 609(d) limits the admissibility of juvenile adjudications as evidence in subsequent proceedings. I agree that allowing evidence of uncharged juvenile conduct would open the door for some prosecutors to elude the juvenile court system by choosing to not charge juvenile acts in order to admit evidence of the acts in a later criminal court proceeding. This would enable some prosecutors to bypass the clear prohibition against the admission of juvenile adjudications and dispositions in subsequent criminal proceedings, as well as the clear prohibition against the admission of evidence given in juvenile proceedings, contained in \u00a7 3-8A-23 of the Courts <em>&amp; </em>Judicial Proceedings Article and would undermine the State\u2019s policy of protecting juveniles.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-4\">The State is correct in pointing out that \u00a7 3-8A-23 of the Courts &amp; Judicial Proceedings Article does not expressly mention unadjudicated juvenile acts; however, both the State and the majority place less significance on the purpose of the Juvenile Causes Act and \u00a7 3-8A-23\u2019s function within it. The Juvenile Causes Act created Maryland\u2019s juvenile court system and process for dealing with juvenile offenders. <em>Lopez-Sanchez, </em>155 Md.App. at 600, 843 A.2d at 927 (\u201cThe separate system of courts created by the Juvenile Causes Act to address the problems of juvenile offenders are governed by their own procedures, as set forth in CJ section 3-8A-01, <em>et seq\u201d). </em>Section 3-8A-23 is a subsection within the Juvenile Causes Act entitled \u201cEffect of proceedings under subtitle\u201d that specifically addresses the effect of juvenile adjudications <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>and proceedings<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> arising under the Juvenile Causes Act. That \u00a7 3-8A-23 does not explicitly reference unadjudicated juvenile conduct does not change the clear legislative policy of protecting or insulating juveniles from the criminal justice system unless or until waived from the juvenile processes. Moreover, this Court\u2019s focus should not be only on the language of the statute but on the underlying legislative intent to separate juveniles and juvenile acts from the criminal justice system.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-4\">After holding that the 1978 incident was properly admitted into evidence and that \u00a7 3-8A-23 of the Courts &amp; Judicial Proceedings Article did not include unadjudicated juvenile acts, the intermediate appellate court noted that it \u201cdecline[d] to construe ... \u00a7 3-8A-23 so that it prohibits the introduction of the very evidence that the Court of Appeals has declared to be of \u201cspecial relevance in a sex crime involving the same perpetrator, victim, and criminal conduct.\u201d <em>Thompson, </em>181 Md.App. at 87, 955 A.2d at 810. The majority adopts this position. I do not find that concern compelling or consistent with the underlying policy of the Juvenile Causes Act. Maryland courts recognize a special \u201csexual propensity\u201d exception to Rule 5-404(b). Adopted by this Court in <em>Vogel v. State, </em>315 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>Md. 458, <em>554 </em>A.2d 1231 (1989), the \u201csexual propensity\u201d exception allows prosecutors in sex crime cases to admit into evidence \u201cprior illicit sexual acts [which] are similar to the offense for which the accused is being tried and involve the same victim.\u201d <em>Vogel, </em>315 Md. at 466, 554 A.2d at 1234. In <em>Acuna v. State, </em>332 Md. 65, 629 A.2d 1233 (1993), this Court elaborated on the sexual propensity exception stating that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ABZ\">The primary policy consideration underlying the rule against other crimes evidence \u201cis that this type of evidence will prejudice the jury against the accused because of the jury\u2019s tendency to infer that the accused is a \u2018bad man\u2019 who should be punished regardless of his guilt of the charged crime, or to infer that he committed the charged crime due to a criminal disposition.\u201d Yet, in the area of sex crimes, particularly child molestation, \u201ccourts have been likely to admit proof of prior acts to show a party\u2019s conformity with past conduct.\u201d Professor McLain suggests that this relaxation of the general prohibition is \u201cprobably because the character evidence is believed to have greater probative value in those circumstances.\u201d In sex crimes cases the special relevance of the other crimes evidence that may be admissible is a criminal propensity particularized to similar sex crimes perpetrated on the same victim.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b562-5\">Thus, in a sex offense prosecution, when the State offers evidence of prior sexual criminal acts of the same type by the accused against the same victim, the law of evidence already has concluded that, in general, the probative value, as substantive evidence that the defendant committed the crime charged, outweighs the inherent prejudicial effect. The discretion exercised by the trial judge in weighing unfair prejudice against probative value is concerned with special features in the particular case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b562-6\"><em>Acuna, </em>332 Md. at 75, 629 A.2d at 1238 (citations omitted). The \u201csexual propensity\u201d exception is based on the notion that evidence of prior sexual misconduct against the same victim has a special probative value, it is asserted, sufficient enough that it generally outweighs the inherent \u201cbad actor\u201d prejudice of other crimes evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>As discussed above, the State of Maryland\u2019s policy of protecting or insulating juveniles from the criminal justice system absent a waiver is evident from the Juvenile Causes Act. In light of that policy, juvenile acts are not legislatively deemed \u201ccrimes, wrongs, or acts\u201d within the meaning of Rule 5-404(b) and are therefore not relevant in subsequent criminal proceedings. Because I would hold that juvenile acts are not within the purview of Rule 5\u2014404(b), I would conclude that the \u201csexual propensity\u201d exception to Rule 5-404(b) does not justify the admissibility of evidence of juvenile acts in subsequent criminal proceedings. In other words, a juvenile act does not constitute a criminal act within the meaning of the sexual propensity exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-6\">The Circuit Court\u2019s admission into evidence testimony with regard to Thompson\u2019s juvenile act was not harmless error. An error is deemed harmless when a reviewing court, upon an independent review of the record, can declare beyond a reasonable doubt that the error in no way influenced the verdict. <em>Dorsey v. State, </em>276 Md. 638, 659, 350 A.2d 665, 678 (1976). In the instant case, the State presented the 1978 incident to the court as the first of five instances of sexual misconduct between Thompson and Ms. Timm. The jury convicted Thompson on charges arising from two of the five incidents. Specifically, the jury heard evidence that Thompson was a sexual predator when he was 14 years old. In addition, the jury heard that Thompson demonstrated that same deviant behavior toward the same victim when Thompson became an adult. It is highly unlikely that the jury separated Thompson\u2019s alleged juvenile acts from his criminal acts. Thus, I do not believe that this Court can say beyond a reasonable doubt that the admission of evidence that Thompson sexually assaulted Ms. Timm when Thompson was a juvenile in no way influenced the jury\u2019s verdict. Therefore, the Court should reverse the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals and remand the case for purposes of a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>Chief Judge BELL and Judge ELDRIDGE authorize me to state that they join in this dissenting opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b551-9\">.
