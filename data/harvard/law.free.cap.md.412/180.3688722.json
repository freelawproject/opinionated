In a Motion to Reconsider, Alter, Amend or Revise the ruling, Mrs. Burnside, for the first time, asserted that under Section 6-202(8), venue was proper in Baltimore City, where she resided, because her \u201cfirst eye injury while under Dr. Wong\u2019s care\u201d occurred there. Judge Pierson denied the Motion, and Mrs. Burnside appealed to the Court of Special Appeals, which affirmed, holding that the alleged misdiagnosis and failure to obtain informed consent, whereby Mrs. Burnside\u2019s diabetic retinopathy was allowed to progressively worsen, constituted an injury such that the \u201ccause of action arose\u201d in Baltimore County. Mrs. Burnside petitioned this Court for certiorari, which we granted, <em>Burnside v. Wong, </em>407 Md. 275, 964 A.2d 675 (2009), to address three questions, which we have renumbered:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b213-5\">I. Does a plaintiffs medical injury occur in the county where, and at the time that, a plaintiff suffers harm resulting from the negligent act of the defendant for the imposition of venue in that county, pursuant to MD. Code Ann., Cts. &amp; Jud. Proc. \u00a7 6-202(8)?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b213-6\">II. May a defendant\u2019s contacts with a Maryland county at the time of his alleged negligence be considered in a trial court\u2019s venue analysis, pursuant to Md.Code Ann., Cts. <em>&amp; </em>Jud. Proc. \u00a7 6-201(a)?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b213-7\">III. Are a defendant physician\u2019s active medical privileges and academic appointments at various hospitals and medical schools located within a Maryland county sufficient contact with that jurisdiction to subject the defendant to venue in that county, pursuant to Md. Code Ann., Cts. <em>&amp; </em>Jud. Proc. \u00a7 6-201(a)?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b214-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>We shall hold that under Section 6-202(8) of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article, venue is proper in a medical malpractice and lack of informed consent action where the alleged misdiagnosis, negligent treatment, or negligent failure to, inform, giving rise to the harm, occurs. We shall further hold in response to questions II and III that pursuant to Section 6-201(a) of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article, venue is determined when suit is brought, and medical privileges and appointments in Baltimore City, such as in issue in the present case, alone, are insufficient to establish venue in Baltimore City.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-5\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b214-6\">On January 31, 2005, Earlene Burnside and her husband, Johnny,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> filed a complaint in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City against Dr. Randall Wong, alleging medical malpractice, lack of informed consent,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and loss of consortium. Mrs. Burnside\u2019s medical malpractice claim was based on the following allegations, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b214-7\">5. In September 2001, Plaintiff Earlene Burnside sought ophthalmic care and treatment from Defendant Wong for her background, diabetic retinopathy in both of her eyes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b215-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>6. Defendant Wong performed a bilateral laser coagulation procedure on Ms. Burnside on November 15, 2001.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b215-4\">7. Ms. Burnside continued to seek ophthalmic care and treatment from Defendant Wong through June 2003, during which time the background, diabetic retinopathy condition in her eyes was allowed by Defendant Wong to progress into a more severe, vision threatening condition known as proliferative retinopathy.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b215-5\">8. On August 21, 2003, Defendant performed a surgical and a laser coagulation procedure on Ms. Burnside\u2019s left eye. On October 9, 2003, Defendant performed a laser coagulation procedure on Ms. Burnside\u2019s right eye, and then on December 18, 2003, he performed another laser coagulation procedure on Ms. Burnside\u2019s right eye.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b215-6\">9. To date, Ms. Burnside is totally blind in her right eye and legally blind in her left eye.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b215-7\">She further alleged the following, regarding Dr. Wong\u2019s breaches of the standards of care in support of her medical malpractice claim:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b215-8\">13. Defendant Wong failed to comply with and breached his duty and was negligent in that he:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b215-9\">(a) failed to establish the appropriate diagnosis for Plaintiff Burnside\u2019s ophthalmic condition;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b215-10\">(b) failed to properly manage and treat Plaintiff Burnside\u2019s ophthalmic condition;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b215-11\">(c) failed to halt the progression of Plaintiff Burnside\u2019s clinically significant vision threatening condition;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b215-12\">(d) failed to perform surgical treatment in a timely fashion;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b215-13\">(e) failed to properly care for, manage and treat Plaintiff Burnside\u2019s ophthalmic condition post-surgery;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b215-14\">(f) failed to apply the appropriate surgical technique during surgery to avoid complications;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b215-15\">(g) failed to apply adequate approach to treatment of encountered complications;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b216-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>(h) failed to timely recognize and treat the Plaintiff Burnside\u2019s condition after surgery; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b216-5\">(i) was otherwise negligent.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b216-6\">Mrs. Burnside also alleged, in support of her informed consent count, that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b216-7\">16. Preoperatively, Defendant Wong, individually and through his agents and employees, had a duty to inform the plaintiff of the probability of success of the proposed surgeries, alternative methods of treatment, the risks of failure or unfortunate side affects, including the risks of blindness, and other factors which a reasonable patient would consider material in making a decision to undergo her surgeries.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b216-8\">17. Contrary to the accepted standards of medical and surgical care, the defendant, individually and/or through his employees and agents, failed to inform Earlene Burnside of the risks of serious consequences, including but not' limited to blindness.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b216-9\">18. If Plaintiff Burnside had been informed that there was a material risk that she would suffer blindness and/or vision impairment, she would not have consented to undergo the surgeries.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b216-10\">19. As a direct and proximate result of the defendant\u2019s failure to inform Ms. Burnside of the likelihood of blindness and/or vision damage and/or serious damages resulting therefrom, Earlene Burnside underwent the surgery and has suffered, and will continue to suffer, severe and permanent injury to her vision, mental anguish, physical impairment and disfigurement, loss of enjoyment of life, and will be required to expend large sums of money for past and future medical and rehabilitative services.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b216-11\">In response, Dr. Wong filed a Motion to Dismiss for Improper Venue, asserting that although he held privileges to practice medicine at Mercy Medical Center in Baltimore City, he had not used the privileges since September 2003, and he otherwise did not reside or carry on a regular business in Baltimore City, pursuant to Section 6-201(a). Dr. Wong also argued that under Section 6-202(8), Mrs. Burnside\u2019s cause of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>action arose in Baltimore County, because the allegedly negligent failure to diagnose, obtain informed consent, and treat Mrs. Burnside took place in his Baltimore County office. Thereafter, after having joined Omni Eye Specialists as a defendant,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Mrs. Burnside then filed an Opposition to Motion to Dismiss for Improper Venue, asserting, based upon Dr. Wong\u2019s deposition testimony, that he regularly examined forty to fifty patients per month at Mercy Medical Center during the period of September 2001 to December 2003, at the time of the alleged negligence, supporting venue in Baltimore City. Dr. Wong\u2019s deposition testimony relied upon was the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b217-5\">[Counsel for Mrs. Burnside]: So the only thing that would have changed from 2000 through 2001, 2002, and 2003, and I am going to say 2004, is the amount of actual surgeries you performed, correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b217-6\">[Dr. Wong]: Sure. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b217-7\">[Counsel]: But the amount of activities, seeing patients would have been the same over those years?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b217-8\">[Dr. Wong]: About the same, sure, except for 2004,1 wasn\u2019t there.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b217-9\">[Counsel]: So, let\u2019s say through 2003 you would have seen in\u2014from 2000 through 2003, you would have seen twenty to\u2014I mean, sorry\u2014forty to fifty patients per month at Mercy Hospital?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b217-10\">[Dr. Wong]: Sure.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b217-11\">[Counsel]: I\u2019m almost done, Doctor. And your consultations would have been the same; it\u2019s the same activity? [Dr. Wong]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b217-12\">Mrs. Burnside also argued that because Dr. Wong held active-staff part-time privileges in the Department of Ophthalmology <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>at Johns Hopkins Hospital through August SI, 2001, a part-time faculty appointment as an instructor in the Department of Ophthalmology at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine through April 28, 2003, and held a volunteer- faculty appointment at the University of Maryland School of Medicine, such contacts, she asserted, coupled with Dr. Wong\u2019s work at Mercy Medical Center, were sufficient to render venue in Baltimore City proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-5\">After a hearing in which the parties argued venue solely on the basis of Section 6-201(a), Judge Pierson signed an Order on May 23, 2005, transferring the action to the Circuit Court for Baltimore County. He reasoned that Dr. Wong\u2019s contacts with Baltimore City at the time suit was brought were insufficient to confer venue in the City:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b218-6\">I don\u2019t think that the facts really are the subject of dispute for purposes of the venue motion. And I think the facts are that Dr. Wong was treating patients [in Baltimore City] quite regularly up until 2003. There wasn\u2019t any basis for dispute that he was doing business in the City of Baltimore until that time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b218-7\">Since that time he\u2019s maintained various forms of privileges at Baltimore City institutions, but apparently has not examined, treated, consulted, or had any contact with any patients since that time. And apparently hasn\u2019t had any contact with those institutions since that time, but has simply confined himself to limiting those forms of affiliation on whatever advertising that maybe well\u2014listing those forms of affiliation as part of his public persona. Let me put it that way.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b218-8\">Now, so the question is, I think, I am required to focus on the time when I should determine doing business. And let me say part of the reason I think I have to is that I don\u2019t think merely having staff privileges or having hospital privileges is sufficient to be doing business. I haven\u2019t found any Maryland case law on that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b219-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>There\u2019s one out of state case ... and that\u2019s <em>Pulcini v. Doctor\u2019s Clinic, </em>158 Mich.App. 56, 404 N.W.2d 702, which is an opinion of the intermediate appellate court in Michigan, which is the only opinion I could find on whether merely having privileges is enough to be doing business ... by a doctor and they said it wasn\u2019t.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b219-5\">But I don\u2019t rest the decision on that, but more on the fact that merely having privileges and not doing anything with them can be nothing more than a paper connection. And I don\u2019t think it has the continuity or the required volume of contact with the forum to constitute doing business within the meaning of the venue statute.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b219-6\">I think it is a matter of statutory construction. And the statute is phrased in the present tense.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b219-7\">And the plaintiff makes a very strong argument that that\u2019s not necessarily dispositive because that\u2019s the only tense they could phrase it in, but I\u2019m not completely persuaded by that argument.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b219-8\">I do agree that the past could be important in that if you had an individual who was engaging in a course of conduct over a number of years that regularity could be important in determining whether he or she continues to do business____ I think you have to look at the entire picture.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b219-9\">But this seems to me to be a case where factually there isn\u2019t any dispute that he stopped seeing patients in 2008. So I don\u2019t think this is a case where I could say because of the conduct in the past it would be a basis to infer that he\u2019s still doing business ... in this jurisdiction.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b219-10\">In terms of fairness the argument the plaintiff makes that this would sort of foster a race to get out of the jurisdiction before he could get sued. The other way to look at it would be it\u2019s within the plaintiff\u2019s power to determine when the defendant is sued. So from that standpoint you could say that it\u2019s just as fair to the plaintiff to look at the time when suit is brought, because it\u2019s the plaintiff who has control over when the suit is brought just as much as it\u2019s the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>defendant who has control over where he or she conducts his activities or her activities.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b220-5\">And it seems to me that the time when suit is brought is not an inappropriate time to measure doing business for purposes of venue. Even though I think arguments could be made that from a fairness standpoint if someone is regularly doing business at the time he or she commits the alleged tort it\u2019s fair to hold that he or she could be sued in the jurisdiction. But you could argue it the other way equally, which is ... what a valuable right it is to be sued where you reside. So you could say well fairness says it\u2019s as of the time you\u2019re being sued.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b220-6\">And since I think it is clear from the words of the statute that it is the time when suit is brought, I believe there is no venue in Baltimore City.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b220-7\">Thereafter, Mrs. Burnside filed a Motion to Reconsider, Alter, Amend, or Revise th\u00e9 ruling transferring the action to Baltimore County, relying for the first time primarily on Section 6-202(8), arguing that a cause of action arises, for the purposes of venue, when facts exist to support each element of a negligence claim, namely, duty, breach, and injury. Mrs. Burnside asserted that her \u201cfirst eye injury while under Dr. Wong\u2019s care\u201d occurred at her residence in Baltimore City, relying on an affidavit executed by Dr. David Newsome, which, in relevant part, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b220-8\">5. It is my opinion to a reasonable degree of medical probability that the first (but not only) eye injury that Mrs. Burnside suffered while under Dr. Wong\u2019s care was when her background retinopathy was allowed to progress to proliferative retinopathy, a more severe condition, despite indications for treatment that more likely than not would have prevented that progression. It is my opinion that this transition from background to proliferative retinopathy occurred between April 8, 2002 and September 16, 2002.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b221-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>Dr. Newsome further opined that Mrs. Burnside\u2019s degenerative eye condition deteriorated to proliferative retinopathy at her residence in Baltimore City:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b221-4\">6. This transition from background to proliferative retinopathy was a gradual process. It is my understanding that Mrs. Burnside lived in Baltimore City between April 8, 2002 and September 16, 2002, as well as before and since that timeframe. It is my further understanding that though some of Mrs. Burnside\u2019s work activities took her into counties other than Baltimore City at times, she spent far more time in Baltimore City than in any other County during this period.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b221-5\">7. Based on the foregoing assumptions, and my understanding of the process of the transition from background to proliferative retinopathy, it is my opinion to a reasonable degree of medical probability that Mrs. Burnside\u2019s first eye injury while under Dr. Wong\u2019s care occurred more likely than not where she spent the vast majority of her time\u2014in Baltimore City.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b221-6\">Mrs. Burnside then filed a second amended complaint asserting that Section 6-202(8) was an alternative basis for venue in Baltimore City, but Judge Pierson denied the Motion to Reconsider, Alter, Amend, or Revise his judgment transferring the case to Baltimore County. Mrs. Burnside filed an appeal to the Court of Special Appeals, which, in an unreported opinion, affirmed the decision of the circuit court judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-7\">The intermediate appellate court considered whether venue in Baltimore City existed at the time suit was brought under Sections 6-201(a) and 6-202(8). The court evaluated the present tense language of Section 6-201 (a), as well as case law from sister jurisdictions interpreting the relevant time frame for \u201cdoing business\u201d under venue statutes with similar language,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and concluded that the \u201cproper time period for deter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>mining whether a defendant carries on a regular business or habitually engages in a vocation is the time when the complaint is filed.\u201d The court further noted that Dr. Wong\u2019s medical privileges at Mercy Medical Center and teaching privileges at the University of Maryland School of Medicine were insufficient to confer venue in Baltimore City under Section 6-201(a), because these privileges were not being used since 2003, in the case of Mercy Medical Center, and the late 1990s, in the case of the University of Maryland. In evaluating whether venue was proper under Section 6-202(8), the court considered the parties\u2019 arguments regarding when a cause of action arises in a medical malpractice action involving an alleged misdiagnosis and lack of informed consent. Relying on our discussion of the definition of \u201cinjury\u201d in related contexts, as well as our venue analysis in <em>Green v. North Arundel Hospital Association, Inc., </em>366 Md. 597, 785 A.2d 361 (2001), the Court of Special Appeals affirmed the transfer of the case to Baltimore County, reasoning that Mrs. Burnside suffered an injury, and thus her malpractice claim arose, \u201cwhen Dr. Wong allegedly failed to diagnose her condition on April 8, 2002 in Baltimore County.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b222-5\">II. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b222-6\">In statutory interpretation, our primary goal is \u201cto discern the legislative purpose, the ends to be accomplished, or the evils to be remedied by a particular provision, be it statutory, constitutional or part of the Rules.\u201d <em>Barbre v. Pope, </em>402 Md. 157, 172, 935 A.2d 699, 708 (2007); <em>Gen. Motors Corp. v. Seay, </em>388 Md. 341, 352, 879 A.2d 1049, 1055 (2005). <em>See also Dep\u2019t of Health and Mental Hygiene v. Kelly, </em>397 Md. 399, 419-20, 918 A.2d 470, 482 (2007). We begin our analysis by first looking to the normal, plain meaning of the language of the statute, reading the statute as a whole to ensure that \u201c \u2018no word, clause, sentence or phrase is rendered surplusage, superfluous, meaningless or nugatory.\u2019 \u201d <em>Barbre, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>402 Md. at 172, 935 A.2d at 708, quoting <em>Kelly, </em>397 Md. at 420, 918 A.2d at 482. <em>See also Kane v. Bd. of Appeals of Prince George\u2019s County, </em>390 Md. 145, 167, 887 A.2d 1060, 1073 (2005). If the language of the statute is clear and unambiguous, we need not look beyond the statute\u2019s provisions and our analysis ends. <em>Barbre, </em>402 Md. at 173, 935 A.2d at 708-09; <em>Kelly, </em>397 Md. at 419, 918 A.2d at 482; <em>City of Frederick v. Pickett, </em>392 Md. 411, 427, 897 A.2d 228, 237 (2006); <em>Davis v. Slater, </em>383 Md. 599, 604-05, 861 A.2d 78, 81 (2004). \u201cOccasionally we see fit to examine extrinsic sources of legislative intent merely as a check of our reading of a statute\u2019s plain language.\u201d <em>Robey v. State, </em>397 Md. 449, 454, 918 A.2d 499, 502 (2007), citing <em>Stanley v. State, </em>390 Md. 175, 185, 887 A.2d 1078, 1084 (2005). \u201cIn such instances, we may find useful the context of a statute, the overall statutory scheme, and archival legislative history of relevant enactments.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b223-4\">III. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b223-5\">We are concerned in the present case with the specific application of our venue statute. Venue is one of a number of jurisprudential concepts relating to the competency of a court generally to render a valid judgment; others include subject matter and personal jurisdiction. While improper venue, generally, does not result in the termination of an action, lack of subject matter jurisdiction necessarily does, and lack of personal jurisdiction can.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-6\">Whether a court may exercise jurisdiction over a putative defendant is dependent on whether personal jurisdiction exists. The defense of lack of personal jurisdiction, unlike subject matter jurisdiction, is waived unless raised in a mandatory preliminary motion, Rule 2-322(a)(l); Paul V. Niemeyer &amp; Linda M. Schuett, <em>Maryland Rules Commentary </em>202 (3rd ed. 2003), but if raised successfully may terminate the action. <em>Bond v. Messerman, </em>391 Md. 706, 731-32, 895 A.2d 990, 1005-06 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b223-7\">Venue, unlike subject matter and personal jurisdiction, focuses largely on geographical nexus related to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>appropriate county in which an action may proceed. John A. Lynch, Jr. &amp; Richard W. Bourne, <em>Modem Maryland Civil Procedure </em>2-111 (2nd ed. 2004). The defense of improper venue, moreover, is waived unless timely raised in a preliminary motion, Rule 2-322(a)(2), Niemeyer &amp; Schuett, <em>supra, </em>at 202, and once raised may result in a transfer of the action to the proper forum, rather than termination of the action altogether. Rules 2-327(b) and 3-326(a); <em>see Odenton Dev. Co. v. Lamy, </em>320 Md. 33, 41, 575 A.2d 1235, 1238 (1990); <em>Payton-Henderson v. Evans, </em>180 Md.App. 267, 274, 949 A.2d 654, 657-58 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b224-4\">The present ease involves the interpretation of two statutory sections defining venue.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The first, Section 6-201 (a) states in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-5\">(a) <em>Civil </em>actions.\u2014Subject to the provisions of \u00a7\u00a7 6-202 and 6-203 and unless otherwise provided by law, a civil action shall be brought in a county where the defendant ... carries on a regular business ... or habitually engages in a vocation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b224-6\">The second, Section 6-202(8) in pertinent part provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-7\">(8) Tort action based on negligence\u2014Where the cause of action arose;</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b224-8\">The major focus of this case, however, concerns when a \u201ccause of action\u201d arises under Section 6-202(8) of the venue statute. Mrs. Burnside posits, citing <em>Green v. North Arundel Hospital Ass\u2019n., </em>366 Md. 597, 612, 785 A.2d 361, 369-70 (2001), <em>cert. denied, </em>535 U.S. 1055, 122 S.Ct. 1913, 152 L.Ed.2d 823 (2002), that a cause of action in negligence arises when facts exist to support each element of the action, including injury, and she did not, as a matter of law, sustain an injury resulting from the misdiagnosis and failure to obtain informed consent until her less severe background retinopathy progressed into proliferative retinopathy, which she characterizes as a more severe condition. She further asserts, based upon the affidavit of her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>expert, Dr. David Newsome, that this worsening of her condition occurred some time between her April and September visits to Dr. Wong\u2019s Baltimore County office, so that she first suffered an injury at her residence in Baltimore City. She asserts as the timeline for the progression, the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-4\">Mrs. Burnside had symptomatic background retinopathy in September 2001 when she first saw Dr. Wong; she had symptomatic background retinopathy when she saw him on April 8, 2002. By the next office visit, on September 16, 2002, Mrs. Burnside had proliferative retinopathy, a more severe condition, meaning the worsening took place after April 8 and before September 16.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b225-5\">Dr. Wong counters, also relying on <em>Green, </em>866 Md. at 612, 785 A.2d at 369-70, that in the context of a degenerative illness, such as diabetic retinopathy, a cause of action arises when the patient\u2019s symptoms are permitted to progress, so that Mrs. Burnside\u2019s cause of action arose in Baltimore County, when she was allegedly misdiagnosed, mistreated and misinformed, permitting her background retinopathy to progress.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-6\">A review of the legislative history of Section 6-202(8) indicates that the provision was first enacted in 1945, as part of a general venue statute. The General Assembly added to then Section 157 of Article 75, Maryland Code (1939), the following language:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-7\">In any action ex delicto in which all of the defendants are not residents of, nor carrying on regular business in, nor habitually engaged in any avocation or employment in one county, the plaintiff may, at his election, sue all said defendants in the county <em>where the cause of action arose.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b225-8\">1945 Maryland Laws, Chapter 468 (emphasis added). An action \u201cex delicto\u201d \u201cimputes a tort done either to the person or property of another.... \u201d <em>Stewart v. United Electric Light &amp; Power Co., </em>104 Md. 332, 334, 65 A. 49, 50 (1906). <em>See </em>John P. Poe, <em>Pleading and Practice in Courts of Common Law </em>154 (3rd ed. 1897) (describing an action ex delicto as one encom<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>passing the six common law actions of case, trover, trespass, replevin, ejectment, and dower).</p>\n<p id=\"b226-5\">In 1954, the statute, then Section 158 of Article 75, Maryland Code (1951), was amended to permit an \u201cex delicto\u201d action against multiple defendants also to be brought where any of the defendants reside:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-6\">In any action ex delicto in which all the defendants are not residents of, not carrying on regular business in, or habitually engaged in any avocation or employment in one county, the plaintiff may, at his election, sue all said defendants in the county where the cause of action arose <em>or sue all of the said defendants in the county where any one of the defendants reside.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b226-7\">1954 Maryland Laws, Chapter 60 (emphasis in original). In 1961, the General Assembly enacted a new provision, adding the language of negligence:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-8\">In any action ex delicto <em>based upon negligence, </em>the plaintiff at his election may sue the defendant or defendants in the county where the cause of action arose.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b226-9\">1961 Maryland Laws, Chapter 603 (emphasis added).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b226-10\">At no time in this history was the phrase \u201ccause of action arose\u201d defined, and it was in this context that we first had the opportunity to consider what the phrase in Section 6-202(8) meant in the context of venue. In <em>Green v. North Arundel Hospital Ass\u2019n, </em>366 Md. 597, 785 A.2d 361 (2001), Darwin Green was born with hydrocephalus, a medical condition requiring two shunts to be placed in his brain when he was born in 1977. At the age of 11, Darwin, experiencing severe <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>headaches, vomiting, and drowsiness, was brought to North Arundel Hospital, an Anne Arundel County hospital, by his father. The physician on duty, Dr. Fields, ordered an emergency CT scan, which indicated several abnormalities that a radiologist attributed to \u201cold changes,\u201d and Dr. Fields discharged Darwin after prescribing painkillers. The next morning, Darwin\u2019s father took him to his pediatrician\u2019s office in Anne Arundel County, because the child continued to complain of headaches. The pediatrician also noted that Darwin appeared drowsy and was staggering and immediately arranged to transfer him to the University of Maryland Hospital in Baltimore City. Doctors at that Hospital determined that Darwin \u201chad increased intracranial pressure\u201d requiring surgical correction. The next day, Darwin suffered a cardiac arrest, which left him severely brain-damaged and in an essentially vegetative state.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-5\">Darwin\u2019s parents filed suit in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City against North Arundel Hospital Association, and Dr. Fields, who immediately moved to dismiss the action for improper venue.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The Circuit Court concluded that under Section 6-201 (b), venue lay only in Anne Arundel County, and transferred the case to the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County. When a trial ended with judgments in favor of the defendants, Darwin\u2019s parents pursued the issue of improper venue on appeal. The Court of Special Appeals, <em>Green v. North Arundel Hospital Ass\u2019n., </em>126 Md.App. 394, 414, 730 A.2d 221, 232 (1999), held that the Circuit Court erred in determining that Section 6-202(8) was inapplicable, but that the error was harmless because the cause of action arose in Anne Arundel County.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>We granted certiorari to consider the parents\u2019 claim that the \u201ccause of action arose\u201d when Darwin suffered his grievous injury, the cardiac arrest in Baltimore City. <em>Green, </em>366 Md. at 607, 785 A.2d at 367. We recognized, however, that the cause of action arose in Anne Arundel County because Darwin\u2019s symptoms, in existence at the time of misdiagnosis, continued to exist:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-4\">Although the plaintiff seeks now to brush it aside, the fact is that, as a result of the alleged negligence of the Anne Arundel County defendants in failing to diagnose the shunt malfunction and have Darwin sent immediately to a facility capable of dealing with that problem, Darwin continued to suffer from headaches, drowsiness, and neurological deterioration.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b228-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 612, 785 A.2d at 369-70. We also recognized that a medical injury may occur \u201ceven though all of the resulting damage to the patient\u201d has not yet occurred, <em>id. </em>at 608, 785 A.2d at 368, citing <em>Oxtoby v. McGowan, </em>294 Md. 83, 97, 447 A.2d 860, 868 (1982), so that although Darwin had suffered a cardiac arrest in Baltimore City, his injury, nevertheless, originated or emanated from allegedly negligent diagnosis and treatment in Anne Arundel County:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-6\">It is evident that the Court of Special Appeals reached the only conclusion possible\u2014that \u201cbecause appellant\u2019s own evidence showed that Darwin <em>first </em>experienced injury in the form of \u2018neurological deterioration\u2019 and pain and suffering in Anne Arundel County, the cause of action arose in that county.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b228-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 612, 785 A.2d at 370, quoting <em>Green, </em>126 Md.App. at 414, 730 A.2d at 232. We concluded, therefore, that venue is proper where the patient \u201cfirst experience^] injury\u201d in the form of a progressive deterioration, rather than the site of ultimate injury, as in <em>Green, </em>Darwin\u2019s cardiac arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-8\">In so concluding that the phrase \u201cwhere the cause of action arose\u201d did not refer to the site of the ultimate injury, but to the disease progression, we explored cases in which venue was not in issue, those being <em>Oxtoby v. McGowan, </em>294 Md. 83, 447 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>A.2d 860 (1982), <em>Owens-Illinois v. Armstrong, </em>326 Md. 107, 604 A.2d 47 (1992), <em>Jones v. Speed, </em>320 Md. 249, 577 A.2d 64 (1990), and <em>Rivera v. Edmonds, </em>347 Md. 208, 699 A.2d 1194 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b229-5\">In <em>Oxtoby v. McGowan, </em>294 Md. 83, 447 A.2d 860 (1982), we considered whether Layla Oxtoby suffered a \u201cmedical injury,\u201d such that her medical malpractice claim arose prior to the effective date of the Health Claims Arbitration Act, Section 3-2A-01 to 3-2A-09 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article, Maryland Code (1974, 1980 RepLVol., 1981 Supp.), under which her claims would have been subject to arbitration. The clause in issue provided that the Act \u201cshall take effect July 1, 1976, and shall apply only to medical <em>injuries occurring on and after that date.\u201d </em>1976 Maryland Laws, Chapter 235, Section 5 (emphasis added). In 1974, Dr. McGowan performed a complete hysterectomy on Mrs. Oxtoby, due to her family history of ovarian cancer. In 1977, however, ovarian cancer was diagnosed, and surgery to attempt to remove the cancer revealed that portions of Mrs. Oxtoby\u2019s left ovary and fallopian tube were intact. Mrs. Oxtoby died as a result of the cancer on June 17, 1980, and Mr. Oxtoby and his two children filed wrongful death and survival claims against Dr. McGowan, alleging medical malpractice in failing to remove all of the ovary and fallopian tube.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-6\">Dr. McGowan filed a motion to dismiss, asserting that the claims needed to have been first submitted to arbitration. We disagreed, concluding that there was evidence in the record that the cancer, though not diagnosed until 1977, was contracted prior to the effective date of the Act. In so holding, we conceived \u201cinjury\u201d in terms of \u201cthe effect on the recipient in the way of hurt or damage.\u201d 294 Md. at 94, 447 A.2d at 866 (citations omitted). We further reasoned that the wrongful death and survival claims could proceed, concluding that \u201ca medical injury occurs ... even though all of the resulting damage to the patient has not been suffered prior to the Act\u2019s effective date.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 97, 447 A.2d at 868. In other words, because Mrs. Oxtoby contracted cancer prior to the Act\u2019s effective date, the wrongful death and survival claims were not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>subject to the procedural requirements of the Act, although Mrs. Oxtoby died in 1980, after the Act\u2019s effective date.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-5\">In <em>Owens-Illinois v. Armstrong, </em>826 Md. 107, 604 A.2d 47 (1992), <em>cert. denied, </em>506 U.S. 871, 118 S.Ct. 204, 121 L.Ed.2d 145 (1992), we had occasion to evaluate the applicability of the statutory cap on non-economic damages in an asbestos-related claim. The language of the statutory cap provision, Section 11-108 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article, Maryland Code (1974, 1989 RepLVol.), included language similar to that in Section 6-202(8):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Am\">(b) <em>Limitation of $350,000 </em>established.\u2014In any action for damages for personal injury in which <em>the cause of action arises </em>on or after July 1, 1986, an award for noneconomic damages may not exceed $350,000.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b230-10\">(Emphasis added). In the case, <em>Owens-Illinois, </em>the manufacturer of products containing asbestos contended that Armstrong\u2019s cause of action \u201carose\u201d in September of 1987, when Armstrong was first diagnosed with asbestosis, so that his award for noneconomic damages was subject to the statutory cap. We rejected that argument, relying on the definition of the word \u201carise,\u201d which we added was \u201cto come into being; originate.\u201d 326 Md. at 121, 604 A.2d at 54. Applying this understanding, based upon the progression of the disease over a twenty year period, we reasoned that Armstrong had been exposed to large amounts of asbestos from 1943 to 1963, and that the cause of action would have had to develop, at the latest, by 1983. We concluded that the cause of action arose, then, prior to 1986, so that Armstrong\u2019s damage award was not controlled by the cap on noneconomic damages. <em>Id. </em>at 123-24, 604 A.2d at 55.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-11\">In the third case cited in <em>Green, </em>that of <em>Jones v. Speed, </em>320 Md. 249, 577 A.2d 64 (1990), we considered the effect of the statute of limitations on a medical malpractice claim relating to a progressive illness. In that case, Elizabeth Jones had consulted Dr. Speed, a specialist, in July of 1978 because she was suffering from debilitating headaches. Dr. Speed continued to treat Mrs. Jones until September of 1985, for a total of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>sixteen visits without ordering a CAT scan or other radio-graphic studies. In February of 1986, Mrs. Jones suffered a seizure, and a CAT scan revealed a tumor, which was successfully removed by another doctor. Mr. and Mrs. Jones filed a complaint against Dr. Speed in July of 1986, alleging negligent failure to properly diagnose Mrs. Jones\u2019 condition. In his defense, Dr. Speed relied upon the statute of limitations, which provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b231-4\">(a) Limitations.\u2014An action for damages for an injury arising out of the rendering of or failure to render professional services by a health care provider, as defined in \u00a7 3-2A-01 of this article, shall be filed within the earlier of:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b231-5\">(1) Five years of the time the injury was committed; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b231-6\">(2) Three years of the date the injury was discovered.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AQp\">Maryland Code (1974, 1989 RepLVol.), Section 5-109(a) of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article. Dr. Speed contended \u201cthat the injury that is the gravamen of the complaint\u201d occurred on July 17, 1978, at the first visit when the initial misdiagnosis was made. We agreed, noting that negligence, namely the misdiagnosis, produced an \u201cinjury\u201d on July 17, 1978, but, we concluded, relying on an affidavit of Mrs. Jones\u2019 expert, that every successive misdiagnosis represented a separate injury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b231-7\">Each time that Mrs. Jones saw Dr. Speed, a separate medical injury occurred, because of the failure of Dr. Speed, at each of these visits, to detect a progressively worsening and changing medical condition.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b231-8\">Each severe and prolonged headache, and the final seizure, grew out of a series of medical injuries directly caused by the carelessness of the treatment administered by Dr. Speed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b231-9\">320 Md. at 256, 577 A.2d at 67. We concluded that Mrs. Jones\u2019 claims for misdiagnosis stemming from her September 1981 visit to Dr. Speed and from subsequent visits, were not time barred. <em>Id. </em>at 261, 577 A.2d at 69.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-10\">Finally, our analysis in <em>Green </em>also included reference to <em>Rivera v. Edmonds, </em>347 Md. 208, 699 A.2d 1194 (1997), which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>also involved the application of the statute of repose to a failure to diagnose medical malpractice claim; Section 5-109(a) of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article provided that a medical negligence claim must be filed within \u201c[f]ive years of the time the injury was committed.\u201d In <em>Rivera, </em>Deborah Edmonds was diagnosed with \u201cfully differentiated squamous cancer\u201d in November of 1989; she died on April 11, 1990. The widower and child of Mrs. Edmonds filed wrongful death and survival claims in 1993 against two pathologists, Dr. Jaffurs and Dr. Rivera, and their respective employers, Cytology Services of Maryland, Inc. and Ivan R. Mattei, M.D., P.A. The Edmonds alleged that in 1983 Mrs. Edmonds underwent cervical biopsies, and that Drs. Jaffurs and Rivera failed to diagnose \u201cinvasive carcinoma\u201d evident in the microscopic slides of those biopsies. Drs. Jaffurs and Rivera moved for summary judgment, asserting that \u201cthe alleged negligent acts or omissions by the defendants occurred nearly ten years prior\u201d to the filing of the complaint, and were time barred. 347 Md. at 214, 699 A.2d at 1198. In their opposition to summary judgment, the Edmonds argued that the injury to Mrs. Edmonds occurred no earlier than May 1,1989, when the cancer caused radiating leg pain of which Mrs. Edmonds complained to her physician, leading to the diagnosis.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-5\">After exploring the nature of microscopic cervical cancer, we concluded that \u201cthe cancer that allegedly should have been detected in Mrs. Edmonds in July 1983 could remain dormant for as long as five years,\u201d so that Mrs. Edmonds suffered \u201cno additional adverse consequences if the microscopic tumor remain[ed] unchanged.\u201d Therefore, she could have suffered an injury as late as July 1988, such that her claim was timely. We recognized, however, that \u201cany delay, and certainly a protracted delay, caused by a misdiagnosis is a harm,\u201d in cases such as <em>Jones, </em>in which the disease is \u201cprogressing and worsening during the period following the misdiagnosis, even if the cancer was asymptomatic.\u201d 347 Md. at 223, 699 A.2d at 1202.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-6\">In <em>Green, </em>in reliance on these four cases, we concluded that Darwin <em>\u201cfirst </em>experienced injury\u201d in Anne Arundel County as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>a result of the alleged negligence of the North Arundel Hospital defendants in failing to diagnose the shunt malfunction, and immediately take steps to curb Darwin\u2019s \u201cneurological deterioration,\u201d rather than at the time of his cardiac arrest in Baltimore City. 366 Md. at 612, 785 A.2d at 369-70. It is this language of \u201cfirst injury\u201d that presents the challenge in this case, because Mrs. Burnside asserts that well before, and on April 8, 2002, she presented to Dr. Wong with symptoms of background diabetic retinopathy, but that by her next office visit, on September 16, 2002, she had proliferative diabetic retinopathy, a more severe condition, and therefore she \u201cfirst experienced injury\u201d when the condition worsened, likely in Baltimore City. Dr. Wong counters by saying that Mrs. Burnside\u2019s diabetic retinopathy existed and was progressing on April 8, 2002 and any alleged misdiagnosis, failure to obtain informed consent, or mistreatment on that date constituted an injury in Baltimore County. The Court of Special Appeals agreed, reasoning that under <em>Jones, Rivera, </em>and <em>Green, </em>Mrs. Burnside suffered an injury, and thus her malpractice claim arose, when Dr. Wong allegedly failed to diagnose her condition on April 8, 2002.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-5\">Both parties before us are able to seek refuge in <em>Green\u2019s </em>holding regarding Section 6-202(8), because the cases upon which <em>Green </em>relied did not deal with <em>where, </em>but rather <em>when </em>an injury occurred.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> When, however, we articulate the principles derived from the four fundamental cases upon which <em>Green </em>relied, we can parse their applicability to the instant case. In <em>Oxtoby, </em>we conceived \u201cinjury\u201d in the context of a progressive illness, ovarian cancer, in terms of \u201cthe effect on the recipient in the way of hurt or damage,\u201d and noted that \u201ca <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>medical injury occurs ... even though all of the resulting damage to the patient\u201d has not yet occurred. 294 Md. at 94, 97, 447 A.2d at 866, 868. In <em>Owens-Illinois, </em>we recognized that a cause of action arises when it comes into being or originates, such that the claim for asbestosis came into being prior to diagnosis. 326 Md. at 124, 604 A.2d at 55. From <em>Jones, </em>we can ascertain that in the context of \u201ca progressively worsening and changing medical condition,\u201d a separate medical injury occurs upon each misdiagnosis. 320 Md. at 256, 577 A.2d at 67. And in <em>Rivera, </em>we recognized that \u201cany delay, and certainly a protracted delay, caused by a misdiagnosis is a harm\u201d where the disease is \u201cprogressing and worsening during the period following misdiagnosis.\u201d 347 Md. at 223, 699 A.2d at 1202.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-5\">In <em>Green, </em>the application of these principles dictated that a cause of action arose under Section 6-202(8) at the situs of the alleged misdiagnosis or negligent treatment in a disease progression, and not at the place of the ultimate harm. Although Darwin Green had experienced the fullness of his injury when he arrested in Baltimore City, we recognized that venue was nevertheless proper in Anne Arundel County, because the disease progression upon which the misdiagnoses occurred, was there. <em>Green, </em>366 Md. at 611-12, 785 A.2d at 369-70.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-6\">Application of the fundamental principles underlying <em>Green </em>to the present case yields the conclusion that the instant cause of action arose in Baltimore County. The failure to obtain informed consent could only occur at the site of the omission. The progressively worsening retinopathy and the potentiality of the ultimate harm, the proliferative type, had to coexist at the time of the alleged misdiagnosis, so that the allegation of failure to properly diagnose and treat could not arise absent the presence of the disease and its potentiality.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Accepting, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>for our purposes, that the transition from background to proliferative diabetic retinopathy represents a gradual process, as Dr. Newsome suggests, the disease must have been germinating, as was the disease in <em>Owens-Illinois, </em>where we also interpreted the language of arising, 326 Md. at 121, 604 A.2d at 54, for Dr. Wong\u2019s negligent acts to constitute misdiagnosis and mistreatment.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Therefore, Mrs. Burnside\u2019s cause of action arose in Baltimore County, where Dr. Wong\u2019s alleged misdiagnosis, mistreatment, and failure to obtain informed consent occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-5\">We turn now to the next issue, namely, whether venue in Baltimore City is proper under Section 6-201(a), which provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b235-6\">(a) <em>Civil </em>actions.\u2014Subject to the provisions of \u00a7\u00a7 6-202 and 6-203 and unless otherwise provided by law, a civil action shall be brought in a county where the defendant ... carries on a regular business ... or habitually engages in a vocation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b235-7\">Mrs. Burnside argues that venue should be determined as of the time the alleged negligence occurred, rather than at the time suit was brought, relying on <em>Simmons v. Urquhart, </em>101 Md.App. 85, 643 A.2d 487 (1994). Mrs. Burnside asserts that at the time of the alleged negligence, from 2001 to 2003, Dr. Wong had practiced medicine in Baltimore City. More specifically, she argues that Dr. Wong regularly examined forty to fifty patients per month at Mercy Medical Center during 2000 to 2003, maintained medical privileges at Johns Hopkins Hospital through August 2001, a part-time faculty appointment at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine through 2003, and a volunteer faculty appointment as a Clinical Assistant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>Professor at the University of Maryland School of Medicine as of the filing of the complaint, all in Baltimore City. Alternatively, she posits that even if we conclude that the time suit was brought is determinative in analyzing venue regarding carrying on a regular business or engaging in a vocation under Section 6-201(a), venue is proper in Baltimore City, because Dr. Wong maintained medical privileges at Mercy Medical Center, teaching privileges at the University of Maryland Medical School, and generally held himself out to the public as a physician serving the greater Baltimore area.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-5\">Dr. Wong counters, relying on both the legislative history of Section 6-201(a) as well as our recent decision in <em>Nodeen v. Sigurdsson, </em>408 Md. 167, 178, 968 A.2d 1075 (2009), that the relevant time for determining venue under Section 6-201(a), pertaining to carrying on a regular business or engaging in a vocation, is the time suit was brought. Dr. Wong further argues that when Mrs. Burnside brought her claim, his maintenance of medical privileges and teaching appointments in Baltimore City did not constitute the substantial and persistent course of conduct that Section 6-201 (a) contemplates.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-6\">We begin by analyzing the plain meaning of Section 6-201(a). As the Court of Special Appeals noted, the provision is cast entirely in the present tense. The use of the words, \u201ccarries\u201d and \u201cengages,\u201d coupled with the phrase, \u201ca civil action shall be brought,\u201d evinces the intent of the Legislature to establish a time requirement in the present for determining the proper venue. In other words, a civil action, in this regard, may be filed only in a county where the defendant, at the time of filing, carries on a regular business, or habitually engages in a vocation.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-7\">This conclusion is consistent with our recent decision in <em>Nodeen, </em>408 Md. at 167, 968 A.2d at 1075, in which we considered whether the word \u201cresides\u201d mandates consideration of venue at the time suit was instituted. In that case, we analyzed venue under Section 6-202(5) of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article, Maryland Code (1973, 2006 Repl. Vol.), which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b237-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>(5) Action relating to custody, guardianship, maintenance, or support of a child\u2014Where the father, alleged father, or mother of the child resides, or where the child resides;</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A1\">When a non-custodial mother filed a complaint for modification of custody in Calvert County where she resided, the Circuit Court transferred the action to Anne Arundel County, reasoning that the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County was the situs of the original custody order. We disagreed, concluding that pursuant to Section 6-202(5), Calvert County was a proper venue, because the mother filed her complaint in the county where she resided at the time of filing. We further held that \u201c[t]he legal sufficiency of the forum selected is determined at the time of filing.\u201d 408 Md. at 178, 968 A.2d at 1082. The present tense versions of \u201ccarries on a regular business ... or habitually engages in a vocation\u201d in Section 6-201(a), mandates the same result.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-5\">Although Mrs. Burnside argues that the present tense wording of section 6-201 (a) \u201cpragmatically encompasses the entire period of viability of a negligence case\u2014the point when the defendant breaches his/her duty\u2014through the period when the breach causes an injury\u2014through the expiration of the statute of limitations or the filing of the Complaint,\u201d this contention is misplaced. Mrs. Burnside relies on <em>Simmons, </em>101 Md.App. at 85, 643 A.2d at 487, in which the Court of Special Appeals considered whether a circuit court possessed inherent authority to transfer an action on the basis of <em>forum non conveniens, </em>embodied in Rule 2-327(c). That Rule stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b237-6\">On the motion of any party, the court may transfer any action to any other circuit court where the action might have been brought if the transfer is for the convenience of the parties and witnesses and serves the interests of justice.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b237-7\">Rule 2-327(c). In <em>Simmons, </em>Mrs. Simmons and her three children filed a wrongful death and survival action against Dr. Urquhart, Dr. Tullner, and Maryland Cardiology Associates, P.A. in Prince George\u2019s County Circuit Court, following the death of Mr. Simmons from a pulmonary embolism. Mary<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>land Cardiology Associates maintained three offices, two located in Montgomery County and one located in Prince George\u2019s County. The cardiologists filed a motion to dismiss, or in the alternative, a motion to transfer the action to Montgomery County, alleging improper venue.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-5\">During oral argument on the venue motion, the Circuit Court judge recognized that defense counsel\u2019s argument was premised on the doctrine of <em>forum non conveniens </em>and ultimately transferred the action to Montgomery County. After the jury determined that the decedent\u2019s contributory negligence barred the Simmons\u2019 recovery, on appeal, the Simmons argued that the Circuit Court judge lacked authority to transfer the case on his own initiative because the Rule states that a trial court may transfer the action \u201c[o]n motion of any party.\u201d Rule 2-327(e). The intermediate appellate court disagreed, reasoning on the bases of meeting minutes of the Rules Committee and federal precedent interpreting the federal statute authorizing case transfers, that \u201cMaryland trial courts possess the authority to transfer cases sua sponte under Rule 2-327(c).\u201d 101 Md.App. at 103, 643 A.2d at 496. The Court of Special Appeals, however, concluded that the transfer to Montgomery County was an abuse of discretion, because the defendant cardiologists failed to adduce proof regarding how an action in Prince George\u2019s County would inconvenience them or any potential witnesses. <em>Id. </em>at 106-07, 643 A.2d at 497-98.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-6\">We reversed, reasoning that \u201cbecause the express language of Md. Rule 2-327(c) requires that a party first make a motion prior to a case being transferred on the grounds of <em>forum non conveniens, </em>a trial court may not act on its own initiative in transferring a case under that rule.\u201d <em>Urquhart v. Simmons, </em>339 Md. 1, 15, 660 A.2d 412, 419 (1995). We further concluded, however, that defendants\u2019 motion was sufficient to support a transfer for <em>forum non conveniens, </em>and therefore the trial court did not transfer the action on its own initiative. Finally, we held that \u201cthe trial court was within its discretion in determining that the balance [of convenience] weighted] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>strongly in favor of transferring the action to Montgomery County.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 18, 660 A.2d at 420.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-5\">Mrs. Burnside makes much of the fact that the Court of Special Appeals, in its recitation of facts, noted \u201c[i]t is undisputed that, <em>at the time the events giving rise to this appeal occurred, </em>[Maryland Cardiology Associates] maintained three offices.\u201d 101 Md.App. at 89, 643 A.2d at 489 (emphasis added by Mrs. Burnside), and posits that an inference can be drawn from that case that \u201cthe period when a cause of action accrues is an applicable venue consideration,\u201d because the intermediate appellate court expressly referred to that period. We disagree. In addition to the fact that in <em>Simmons, </em>the Court of Special Appeals considered the contours of the doctrine of <em>forum non conveniens, </em>rather than venue under Section 6-201(a), the posited language was merely a factual reference rather than a dispositive consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-6\">We conclude that, generally, the proper time for determining venue dependent on where a defendant carries on a regular business or habitually engages in a vocation is at the time suit is brought, which in the present case is Baltimore County.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-7\">Our final task, then, is to consider whether Dr. Wong\u2019s professional contacts with Baltimore City at the time suit was brought are sufficient to sustain venue there. Mrs. Burnside argues that Dr. Wong maintained \u201cactive privileges\u201d at Mercy Medical Center and \u201cteaching privileges\u201d at the University of Maryland School of Medicine, even after the initial complaint was filed. Mrs. Burnside further notes that Dr. Wong held himself out as a retina specialist to the public, particularly Baltimore City residents, and these contacts taken together permit venue in Baltimore City.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-8\">Dr. Wong contends, conversely, that at the time that Mrs. Burnside instituted her action, he did not have the requisite business contacts with Baltimore City, as required by Section 6-201(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b240-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>In <em>Dodge Park Enterprises, Inc. v. Welsh, </em>237 Md. 570, 207 A.2d 503 (1965), we considered whether a lawsuit was properly filed in Montgomery County against three attorneys whose office was located in Prince George\u2019s County. The complaint alleged that the attorneys generally practiced law throughout the State of Maryland, and in particular, Montgomery and Prince George\u2019s Counties. The Circuit Court granted the motion to dismiss, and we remanded to determine whether the attorneys \u201cregularly pursue[d] their profession as lawyers in Montgomery County.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 573, 207 A.2d at 504. We emphasized that \u201cthe regular business or habitual avocation or employment\u2019 contemplated by [Section 6-201(a)] included * * the continuous pursuit of some calling or profession, such as is ordinarily engaged in as a means of livelihood or for the purpose of gain or profit.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 572, 207 A.2d at 504, quoting <em>National Bank of Baltimore v. Steele, </em>143 Md. 484, 487, 122 A. 633, 634 (1923). Thereby, \u201ccontinuous pursuit of some calling or profession\u201d is a prerequisite under Section 6-201(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b240-5\">In the present case, Judge Pierson determined that Dr. Wong was not carrying on a regular business or habitually engaging in the practice of medicine in Baltimore City at the time suit was brought in 2005. Judge Pierson emphasized, \u201cI don\u2019t think merely having staff privileges or having hospital privileges is sufficient to be doing business,\u201d and further found, \u201chaving privileges and not doing anything with them can be nothing more than a paper connection.\u201d These conclusions are amply supported by the record. Dr. Wong testified, for example, in his deposition that although he held medical privileges at Mercy Medical Center, he had not exercised them since 2003:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b240-6\">[Counsel for Dr. Wong]: Do I understand from the questions that we\u2019ve been through today that the last time that you saw a patient for a medical anything was in September of '03 at Mercy Medical Center?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b240-7\">[Dr. Wong]: That is correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>[Counsel]: And since that time you have not seen, cared for, treated, consulted or provided medical services for anybody in the city of Baltimore, is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-5\">[Dr. Wong]: That\u2019s correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-6\">[Counsel]: You saw the plaintiff in this case, Mrs. Burnside, and provided medical treatment to her; did any of that medical care and treatment occur, to your knowledge, in Baltimore City?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-7\">[Dr. Wong]: Did not.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b241-8\">Similarly, Barbara Elizabeth Rose, the Manager of Medical Staff Services at Mercy Medical Center, testified in her deposition that despite maintaining medical privileges at Mercy Medical Center from December 15, 1993 through April 13, 2005, Dr. Wong had no actual involvement at the facility since 2003:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-9\">[Counsel]: Do you know whether Dr. Wong participated in any medical education through Mercy Medical Center?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-10\">[Ms. Rose]: No, he did not.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-11\">[Counsel]: And to the best of your knowledge, Dr. Wong never participated in any teaching involving any residents or fellows? [Ms. Rose]: That\u2019s correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-12\">[Counsel]: And have you looked to see whether Dr. Wong participated in teaching any continuing medical education courses?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-13\">[Ms. Rose]: I did check. He did not participate in any [continuing medical education] programs nor did he teach at any.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-14\">[Counsel]: What types of volunteer work are there, clinics and things like that that you have?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-15\">[Ms. Rose]: There\u2019s clinics. That I think would be the most where he would be involved but there was no\u2014he didn\u2019t participate.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b242-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>Moreover, although Dr. Wong maintained teaching privileges at the University of Maryland School of Medicine at the time the present action was instituted, the record indicates that he had not taught, volunteered, or participated in research at the school since around 1997. Specifically, Dr. Wong, in his deposition, described his involvement with the University of Maryland School of Medicine between 2000 and 2004 as \u201czero.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b242-5\">Finally, Judge Pierson\u2019s findings are supported in the record by the deposition testimony of Dr. Wong, regarding his contacts with Johns Hopkins, or lack thereof, at the time the suit was brought:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-6\">[Counsel for Mrs. Burnside]: Then let\u2019s go to Johns Hopkins for this entry on your C.V. What is incorrect about that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-7\">[Dr. Wong]: I am pretty sure I lost my ophthalmic privileges to [the Wilmer Eye Institute at Johns Hopkins] in the nineties or at the very least I haven\u2019t been to Johns Hopkins to see patients probably since 1997 or 1998.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AU\">Therefore, Judge Pierson concluded that \u201clisting those forms of affiliation as part of [Dr. Wong\u2019s] public persona\u201d were insufficient to confer venue in Baltimore City. Judge Pierson\u2019s findings are clearly supported by the record and his conclusions are sound.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-8\">In a similar situation, a Michigan intermediate appellate court has addressed whether merely holding, but not actively utilizing, medical privileges constitut\u00e9s \u201cconducting business\u201d for the purposes of venue. In <em>Pulcini v. Doctor\u2019s Clinic, P.C., </em>158 Mich.App. 56, 404 N.W.2d 702 (1987), the plaintiffs argued that venue in Wayne County was proper because the defendant doctor held privileges, entitling him to participate in an ophthalmology residency training program and to admit patients, at two Wayne County hospitals.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Although the defen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>dant doctor paid annually to have those privileges, he had never admitted patients to the hospital and had never taught there. <em>Id. </em>at 703. The trial court concluded that venue in Wayne County was proper, ruling that \u201ca doctor who has the privilege to admit patients to a Wayne County hospital is doing business in Wayne County.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Court of Appeals of Michigan reversed, reasoning Wayne County was an improper venue for the lawsuit:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-5\">In this case, [the doctor] had merely the right to admit patients to two Wayne County hospitals operated by the Detroit Osteopathic Hospital Corporation. He never exercised that right. It is not disputed that he was a member of the corporation only so that he could participate in the residency training program. He did not have a \u201creal presence\u201d or systematic or continuous business dealings in Wayne County.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b243-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 704. This analysis is consistent with our reasoning today. Because Dr. Wong merely held privileges at Baltimore City institutions, without more, his ties to Baltimore City were insufficient to confer venue there.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-7\">Therefore, we conclude that venue was proper in Baltimore County, because the cause of action arose there pursuant to Section 6-202(8), and because at the time suit was brought, when venue is properly determined under Section 6-201(a), Dr. Wong had only incidental connections to Baltimore City, while he regularly practiced medicine in Baltimore County.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-8\">JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS AFFIRMED.

In September, 2001, she sought ophthalmic care and treatment for background, diabetic retinopathy, which was present in both eyes,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> from Dr. Randall V. Wong, at his Baltimore County office. On November 15, 2001, Dr. Wong treated Mrs. Burnside by performing a bilateral laser coagulation procedure. He noted subsequently, during an April 8, 2002 office visit, that Mrs. Burnside\u2019s visual acuity was stable. Thereafter, on September 16, 2002, Mrs. Burnside was diagnosed with proliferative diabetic retinopathy, a more advanced form of diabetic retinopathy. Dr. Wong treated this new condition by performing laser coagulation procedures on both eyes.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> While receiving care and treatment from Dr. Wong, Mrs. Burnside continued to reside in Baltimore City.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-6\">Then totally blind in her right eye and legally blind in her left eye, Mrs. Burnside and her husband filed in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City a complaint against Dr. Wong, alleging negligence, breach of informed consent and loss of consortium. Dr. Wong moved to dismiss, arguing, pursuant to Maryland Code (1973, 2002 Repl. Vol) \u00a7 \u00a7 6-201(a)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and 6-202(8)<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number><footnotemark>4</footnotemark> of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article, that venue was improper. Addressing only section 6-201 (a), as the parties had done, the hearing court ruled that venue in Baltimore City was improper and transferred the case to Baltimore County. In her Motion to Reconsider, Alter, Amend or Revise the trial court\u2019s ruling, Mrs. Burnside argued that venue was proper under section 6-202(8). In support of that position, Mrs. Burnside attached the affidavit of an expert, Dr. Newsome, who opined that Mrs. Burnside more likely than not suffered the subject eye injury in Baltimore City. Specifically, he said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b245-5\"><em>\u201c5. </em>It is my opinion to a reasonable degree of medical probability that the first (but not only) eye injury that Mrs. Burnside suffered while under Dr. Wong\u2019s care was when her background retinopathy was allowed to progress to proliferative retinopathy, a more severe condition, despite indications for treatment that more likely than not would have prevented that progression. It is my opinion that this transition from background to proliferative retinopathy occurred during April 8, 2002 and September 16, 2002.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b245-6\">\u201c6. This transition from background to proliferative retinopathy was a gradual process. It is my understanding that Mrs. Burnside lived in Baltimore City between April 8, 2002 and September 16, 2002, as well as before and since that timeframe. It is my further understanding that though some of Mrs. Burnside\u2019s work activities took her into counties other than Baltimore City at times, she spent far more time in Baltimore City than in any other County during this period.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b245-7\">\u201c7. Based on the foregoing assumptions, and my understanding of the process of the transition from background to proliferative retinopathy, it is my opinion to a reasonable degree of medical probability that Mrs. Burnside\u2019s first eye <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>injury while under Dr. Wong\u2019s care occurred more likely than not where she spent the vast majority of her time\u2014in Baltimore City.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b246-4\">The motion was denied, prompting Mrs. Burnside\u2019s appeal to the Court of Special Appeals.

Because the standard of care calls for surgery or radiation treatment when the condition is diagnosed, the Defendants contend that any delay, and certainly a protracted delay, caused by a misdiagnosis is a harm within the meaning of <em>Hill. </em>Ordinarily we would have no disagreement with that assessment in a case, such as <em>Jones v. Speed, </em>320 Md. 249, 577 A.2d 64, where the uncontradicted evidence on summary judgment is that the undiagnosed cancer was progressing and worsening during the period following the misdiagnosis, even if the cancer was asymptomatic. <em>Id. </em>at 256, 577 A.2d at 67. \u201cHere, however, the evidence most favorable to the party opposing summary judgment is that the cancer that allegedly should have been detected in Mrs. Edmonds in July 1983 could remain dormant for as long as five years. The inference most favorable to the plaintiff is that there are no additional adverse consequences if the microscopic tumor remains unchanged. The Defendants have not attempted to demonstrate that Dr. Rocereto\u2019s statement is junk science.

When his symptoms continued on the following day, his father took him to the North- Arundel Hospital Association\u2019s (NAHA) emergency room. After examining Green, reviewing the results of an emergency CT scan and consulting with a neurologist, the examining doctor gave him a prescription painkiller and discharged him once the pain was gone. The following day, Green, still complaining of headaches, was taken to a doctor\u2019s office in Anne Arundel County and then immediately to the University of Maryland Hospital (UMH) in Baltimore City. While at UMH, he suffered a cardiac arrest, which left him severely brain damaged.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-4\">Green filed an action in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City against NAHA and the examining physician at NAHA, although both did business only in Anne Arundel County and the physician resided there. He premised his choice of venue on Section 6-202(8), relying on the fact that it was in Baltimore City that he suffered his cardiac arrest, which he maintained was the injury giving rise to his cause of action. The trial court did not agree. It ruled that Section 6-201(a), rather than Section 6-202(8), was the applicable provision and that, pursuant to that section, venue lay in Anne Arundel County, where the defendants resided and/ or did business. Although the Court of Special Appeals held that Section 6-202(8) applied, it affirmed the judgment for the defendants, concluding that Green\u2019s injury occurred in Anne Arundel County. In affirming the intermediate appellate court, this Court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b250-5\">\u201cIn answers to interrogatories, the plaintiff averred that, after leaving NAHA and before reporting to UMH the next afternoon, Darwin [Green] suffered a continued \u2018neurological deterioration\u2019 from the ever-increasing intracranial pres<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>sure. Although Darwin seeks not to brush it aside, the fact is that, as a result of the alleged negligence of the Anne Arundel County defendants in failing to diagnose the shunt malfunction and have plaintiff sent immediately to a facility capable of dealing with that problem, Darwin continued to suffer from headaches, drowsiness, and neurological deterioration. That constitutes a \u2018hurtful or damaging effect\u2019 (\u25a0Oxtoby); it is the kind of harm we recognized in <em>Jones </em>as construing an injury; and it clearly falls within the scope of \u2018pain or other manifestation of an injury\u2019 under <em>Rivera. </em>Clearly, Darwin, through his parents, could have sued the NAHA defendants on [the day they saw Darwin].\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b251-4\">The Court further stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-5\">\u201cIt is evident that the Court of Special Appeals reached the only conclusion possible\u2014that because appellant\u2019s own evidence showed that Darwin <em>first </em>experienced injury in the form of \u2018neurological deterioration\u2019 and pain and suffering in Anne Arundel County, the cause of action arose in that County. Venue thus lay in Anne Arundel County, and no error was committed by the Circuit Court for Baltimore City in transferring the case.\u201d (citations omitted)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b251-6\"><em>Green, </em>366 Md. at 612, 785 A.2d at 369-70.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-7\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b251-8\">In the instant case, as in <em>Green, </em>we must determine, for the purpose of establishing venue under Section 6-202(8), where Mrs. Burnside\u2019s injury occurred. An injury may be either symptomatic or asymptomatic. <em>Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary </em>2318 (2002), defines a symptomatic condition as \u201cbeing a symptom of a disease; characteristic, indicative.\u201d An asymptomatic condition, on the other hand, is one \u201cpresenting no subjective evidence of disease.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 136.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-9\">The injury in <em>Green </em>was, the majority in effect held, symptomatic. The plaintiffs painful headaches were symptomatic of an injury and evidence that the plaintiff had suffered an injury at NAHA as a result of the negligent misdiagnosis he alleged. There is no such symptom of injury in Mrs. Burn<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>side\u2019s case. That she suffered with diabetic retinopathy is not in dispute. That her diabetic retinopathy progressed to proliferative retinopathy also is not in dispute. Moreover, the record does not reflect that this progression was accompanied by any visible or tangible manifestation that it was occurring. On the contrary, the progression to proliferative retinopathy was without any apparent symptoms; it was asymptomatic. The critical question, therefore, is when, at what point did, Mrs. Burnside\u2019s diabetic retinopathy disease advance beyond the point where it was at the time of misdiagnosis to a point where it (a) could no longer effectively be treated or (b) it could no longer be treated as well or as completely as it could have been at the time of misdiagnosis. <em>Edmonds v. Cytology Services, </em>111 Md.App. at 270, 681 A.2d at 564.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-5\"><em>Green </em>teaches that a plaintiff who experiences pain before, during and after a misdiagnosis, suffers an \u201cinjury\u201d for venue purposes, under Section 6-202(8); the injury and misdiagnosis coincide.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> 366 Md. at 612, 785 A.2d at 370. The majority extends the <em>Green </em>holding to a plaintiff whose injury is asymptomatic, who neither experiences pain nor otherwise manifests symptoms of an injury, reasoning that the injury, in this case, the \u201cprogressively worsening retinopathy and the potentiality of the ultimate harm, the proliferative type,\u201d 412 Md. at 206, 986 A.2d at 442, must have coexisted with the misdiagnosis. Thus, after the decision in the instant case, in misdiagnosis cases, venue always will lie at the site of the misdiagnosis, whether or not there are manifestations of the injury, whether it is symptomatic or asymptomatic. This interpretation of injury renders the test announced in <em>Edmonds </em>and adopted by this Court, as well as Section 6-202(8), meaningless. I addressed this very concern in my dissent in <em>Green:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b253-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>\u201c[The <em>Edmonds] </em>test provides alternative methods, depending upon the existing circumstances, of determining when an \u2018injury\u2019 has occurred. To be sure, one alternative applies when the plaintiff experiences pain or other manifestation of an injury. But that alternative must be juxtaposed against the alternative that applies when the injury has progressed beyond the point at which it was at diagnosis, such that it cannot then be treated or treatment would be more difficult or expensive. The latter alternative must apply to the situation in which the misdiagnosis is of an asymptomatic injury. Logically, a different test, at least as difficult to prove, must apply when the condition that is misdiagnosed is symptomatic. That test, I submit, must require proof that the pain being experienced indicates a deterioration of the condition beyond where it was when the diagnosis was made.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b253-4\"><em>Green, </em>366 Md. at 639, 785 A.2d at 386.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-5\">In <em>Oxtoby, </em>we stated that an \u201cinjury\u201d is the \u201ceffect on the recipient in the way of hurt or damage.\u201d 294 Md. at 94, 447 A.2d at 866. The only hurt or damage being experienced by Mrs. Burnside when her condition was misdiagnosed was the background retinopathy with which she already was suffering; that, not the deterioration of the existing eye disease to a point affecting treatment or Mrs. Burnside\u2019s treatment prospects or the resulting progression itself of the condition to proliferative retinopathy, was the only condition that coexisted with Dr. Wong\u2019s misdiagnosis. Indeed, there was expert evidence that the progression of Mrs. Burnside\u2019s background retinopathy to proliferative retinopathy occurred some time after the misdiagnosis and before the discovery of her injury. To be an \u201cinjury,\u201d within the contemplation of section 6-202(8), there must have been a progression of Mrs. Burnside\u2019s background retinopathy to a more serious condition; the status of Mrs. Burnside\u2019s retinopathy must have deteriorated significantly from what it was when the faulty diagnosis was made. Where there is no pain or other objective and overt manifestation of injury, that means deterioration \u201cbeyond the point at which it was at diagnosis, such that it cannot then be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>treated or treatment would be more difficult or expensive,\u201d <em>Green, </em>366 Md. at 639, 785 A.2d at 386 (Bell, C.J., dissenting), than it would have been had the diagnosis been correct. Thus, Mrs. Burnside\u2019s injury could not have arisen until, as a result of Dr. Wong\u2019s misdiagnosis, she was caused greater harm than that she was experiencing at the time of diagnosis. That,\u2014according to the only expert testimony\u2014, more likely than not occurred in Baltimore City, where Mrs. Burnside spent the majority of her time.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-5\">Moreover, it is well settled that an \u2018injury\u2019 \u201crefers to a legally cognizable wrong or damage resulting from the rendering or failure to render health care.\u201d <em>Oxtoby, </em>294 Md. at 94, 447 A.2d at 866; <em>See also Hill, </em>304 Md. at 695-96, 501 A.2d at 30. It follows that a misdiagnosis and \u201cinjury\u201d cannot coexist. You cannot simultaneously have ah asymptomatic injury resulting from a failure to diagnose.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Unless it is sympto<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>matic, <em>Green, </em>366 Md. at 612, 785 A.2d at 370, an \u201cinjury\u201d resulting from a misdiagnosis cannot \u201ccoexist\u201d with the misdiagnosis, the result of the misdiagnosis simply cannot precede or coincide with the diagnosis. It must occur after the misdiagnosis has been made.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-5\">The majority states, further, that \u201c[i]n <em>Oxtoby, </em>we conceived \u2018injury\u2019 in the context of a progressive illness, ovarian cancer, in terms of \u2018the effect on the recipient in the way of hurt or damage,\u2019 and noted that \u2018a medical injury occurs ... even though all of the resulting damage to the patient\u2019 has not yet occurred.\u201d 412 Md. at 205-06, 986 A.2d at 442. I do not disagree with this statement. I simply disagree with the majority\u2019s application of the <em>Oxtoby </em>decision to the instant case. I do not contend that Mrs. Burnside\u2019s injury occurred at the time she discovered that her background retinopathy had progressed to proliferative retinopathy; injury-deterioration of the status quo of the disease at diagnosis-undoubtedly had occurred prior to that discovery. Moreover, I agree with <em>Rivera, </em>which the majority cites to support its holding, in which we rested \u201con the nature of microscopic cervical cancer, as revealed by the record.\u201d 347 Md. at 222, 699 A.2d at 1202. The decision in this case, likewise, must rest on the nature and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>the progression of Mrs. Burnside\u2019s proliferative retinopathy, as revealed by the record. And the record in this case contains expert opinion, offered by Mrs. Burnside, that she was injured when her existing eye injury, the background retinopathy, was allowed to progress to proliferative retinopathy, that was a gradual process that occurred between April 8, 2002 and September 16, 2002 and that, during this period, Mrs. Burnside \u201cresided in Baltimore City and spent nearly all of her leisure time there.\u201d She estimated that \u201cshe spent more than seventy-five percent ... of the total hours in any given week in Baltimore City.\u201d There is no other \u201cmedical opinion, medical record, or medical testimony\u201d to suggest otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-5\">The evidence in this case is the exact opposite of that found in <em>Jones v. Speed, </em>\u201cwhere ... the uncontradicted evidence on summary judgment was that the undiagnosed cancer was progressing and worsening during the period following the misdiagnosis, even if the cancer was asymptomatic.\u201d <em>Rivera, </em>347 Md. at 223, 699 A.2d at 1202. Although I believe that the record in this case suggests that the progression of Mrs. Burnside\u2019s disease occurred some time after the misdiagnosis and before the discovery of the injury, at the very least whether it did is a jury question.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-6\">My view is consistent with how other jurisdictions have defined \u201cinjury\u201d resulting from a misdiagnosis. <em>Estate of Genrich v. OHIC Ins. Co., </em>318 Wis.2d 553, 769 N.W.2d 481, 487 (2009) (\u201c... an actionable injury arises when the [negligent act or omission] causes a greater harm than [that which] existed at the time of the [negligent act or omission]\u201d); <em>Paul v. Skemp, </em>242 Wis.2d 507, 625 N.W.2d 860, 870 (2001) (\u201c[T]he misdiagnosis [in a medical malpractice action] is the negligent act or omission. The misdiagnosis is not the injury. The misdiagnosis may or may not result in an injury; and, that injury may occur concurrently, or there may be a delay between the misdiagnosis and the injury.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b256-7\">I continue of the view I expressed, in dissent, in <em>Green, </em>the majority\u2019s interpretation renders the \u201cvenue statute a nullity <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>because [under its analysis] an action for misdiagnosis of\u2019 any condition, whether symptomatic or asymptomatic, \u201cwould necessarily, and always, have to be brought where the misdiagnosis occurred.\u201d 366 Md. at 640, 785 A.2d at 386.

The majority apparently believes that the critical condition for the purpose of determining when injury occurred is Mrs. Burnside\u2019s background diabetic retinopathy, the symptom of which simply progressively worsened. Thus, the majority disputes that Mrs. Burnside\u2019s condition was asymptomatic, relying, for support, on Mrs. Burnside\u2019s expert's affidavit that indicated that \"she presented to Dr. Wong with symptoms of background diabetic retinopathy, from which proliferative retinopathy gradually progressed.\u201d <em>Burnside v.

Proliferative retinopathy, on the other hand, is \"characterized by neovascularization of the retina and optic disk, proliferation of fibrous tissue, vitreous hemorrhage, and eventually retinal detachment with blindness.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Background diabetic retinopathy is not listed as a characteristic of proliferative retinopathy. Much as the majority may want it to be so, a condition presently being suffered is not a symptom of an aggravated, progressive form of that condition; background <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>diabetic retinopathy simply is not a symptom of proliferative retinopathy.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-7\">It is not surprising that Mrs. Burnside was displaying symptoms of background diabetic retinopathy. Similarly, it is not surprising, not to mention logical, that she was not displaying symptoms of proliferative retinopathy, a progression to which the condition she was suffering, gradually could, but need not, develop. The question is when did this process of gradual progression become an injury within the contemplation and meaning of <em>Rivera v. Edmonds, supra </em>and <em>Oxtoby v. McGowan, </em>294 Md. 83, 447 A.2d 860?; when, in other words, did the symptoms of background diabetic retinopathy develop into symptoms of proliferative retinopathy? That question must answered in light of the fact that the diagnosis of Mrs. Burnside\u2019s visual acuity following an April 8, 2002 office visit was that it was stable.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-8\">On another note, the majority\u2019s protestations that this case involves, like <em>Green, </em>a symptomatic condition is concession that there is a difference in analysis and perhaps result, depending upon which\u2014 symptomatic or asymptomatic\u2014the condition happens to be. If it is not a concession, one can only wonder why the majority bothers to raise the issue at all.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
