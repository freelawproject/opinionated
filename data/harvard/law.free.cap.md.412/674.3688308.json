Dahne and Marlene Z. Dahne, Appellees, \u201cbe DISMISSED WITHOUT PREJUDICE[,]\u201d and presented the Court of Special Appeals with a single question:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b704-8\">Whether the trial court has the authority and discretion, pursuant to Maryland Rule 2-507(b)[,] to dismiss a case with prejudice[?]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b704-9\">Prior to argument before a panel of the Court of Special Appeals,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> this Court issued a writ of certiorari on its own initiative. 406 Md. 743, 962 A.2d 370 (2008). For the reasons that follow, we hold that dismissal \u201cwithout prejudice\u201d is the only dismissal that can be imposed for a violation of Md. Rule 2-507(b). We shall therefore affirm the judgment of the Circuit Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-10\">Procedural History</p>\n<p id=\"b704-11\">On October 14, 2003, Appellees filed a \u201cCOMPLAINT\u201d in which they asserted that Appellant \u201cDr. Rahim Hariri l.k.a.c/o Plaintiff Address\u201d had breached a \u201ccovenant not to compete\u201d provision in a \u201ccontract under seal\u201d that was signed by the parties on October 3, 2000. Dr. Hariri was never served with a copy of that complaint. On February 7, 2005, Appellees filed a second \u201cCOMPLAINT\u201d in which they asserted that Dr. Hariri and five other defendants\u2014Dr. Thomas Blaik, Dr. Melton Belle, Dr. Clare Mutale, Dr. Dennis Hatfield, and Dr. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"677\">*677</page-number>Robert McNeil\u2014had breached contracts that were \u201csigned, under seal[.]\u201d In this second complaint, Appellees provided \u201cl.k.a. c/o Plaintiff Address\u201d as the address for each defendant. The record shows that the first issuance of original process of the second complaint occurred on February 9, 2005. The record also shows that three defendants were served by certified mail with a copy of this complaint: (1) Dr. Hariri, on September 6, 2007, (2) Dr. Thomas Blaik, on September 6, 2007, and (3) Dr. Belle, on October 3, 2007.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-4\">On September 14, 2007, the Clerk of the Circuit Court issued a \u201cNOTIFICATION TO PARTIES OF CONTEMPLATED DISMISSAL,\u201d that, in pertinent part, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b705-5\">Pursuant to Maryland rule 2-507 this proceeding will be \u201cDISMISSED FOR LACK OF JURISDICTION OR PROSECUTION WITHOUT PREJUDICE,\u201d 30 days after service of this notice, unless prior to that time a written motion showing good cause to defer the entry of an order of dismissal is filed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b705-6\">On September 19, 2007, counsel for Dr. Hariri filed an \u201cANSWER TO COMPLAINT.\u201d On October 15, 2007, Appellees\u2019 counsel filed a \u201cMOTION TO DEFER DISMISSAL UNDER MARYLAND RULE 2-507\u201d that included the following assertions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b705-7\">[Tjhree of the Defendants have been served and [ ] justice will be served by the case being permitted to go forward. There was no deliberate delay by Plaintiff in serving Defendants as his counsel was checking for addresses and recently obtained better search tools to carry out searches and thus located the correct addresses. Defendant Hariri has answered and has not filed a Motion to dismiss for lack of prosecution and Defendant Blaik has further been in contact with counsel for Plaintiff. Defendant Belle is further served.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b705-8\">On October 29, 2007, counsel to Dr. Blaik filed a \u201cMOTION TO DISMISS COMPLAINT, WITH PREJUDICE, FOR FAILURE TO STATE A CLAIM UPON WHICH RELIEF CAN BE GRANTED AND REQUEST FOR SANCTIONS.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"678\">*678</page-number>On November 6, 2007, Dr. Belle filed a <em>pro se </em>\u201cANSWER TO COMPLAINT.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b706-5\">On November 13, 2007, Appellees filed a six count \u201cAMENDED COMPLAINT\u201d against the defendants named in the complaint filed on February 7, 2005. In this complaint, none of the defendants\u2019 addresses was stated to be \u201cl.k.a.c/o Plaintiffs Address,\u201d and the claims against each defendant appeared in a separate count.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b706-6\">On November 15, 2007, Dr. Hariri and Dr. Hatfield filed a <em>\u201cMotion to Dismiss for Lack of Prosecution\u201d </em>that included the following <em>\u201cConclusion</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b706-7\">In light of the provisions of Maryland Rule 2-507(c) as well as the holding of <em>Reed v. Cagan </em>[, 128 Md.App. 641, 739 A.2d 932 (1999),] dismissal with prejudice of Plaintiffs\u2019 claims against Defendants Hariri and Hatfield is warranted, justified and required.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b706-8\">On November 16, 2007, Dr. Blaik filed an <em>\u201cAMENDED MOTION TO DISMISS COMPLAINT, WITH PREJUDICE\u201d </em>that requested both dismissal of the complaint, \u201cand that Plaintiffs be ORDERED to pay Defendant Blaik\u2019s attorney\u2019s fees and costs in defending this action.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b706-10\">On December 3, 2007, Appellees filed an <em>\u201cANSWER AND OPPOSITION TO MOTION TO DISMISS BY DEFENDANTS HARIRI AND HATFIELD AND </em>BLAIK\u2019 that included the following arguments:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b706-11\">The contracts of Doctors Blaik, Hariri and Hatfield are contracts under seal and as such the fact that witness memories may have faded and like defenses are simply irrelevant. By signing a contract under seal, they agreed that they can be sued for breach, (and can also sue if they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"679\">*679</page-number>feel the practice breached its duties), for a period of 12 years as per Maryland Courts and Judicial Proceedings Code Annotated \u00a7 5-102.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b707-5\">... In this case, given the fact that no discovery has occurred to date, and there is no prejudice at all to Defendants by delay in service, the motions to dismiss should be denied. The only prejudice that may have occurred is the fact that it has been a long time since the events in question occurred. However, by signing a contract under seal, each Defendant accepted that chance and indeed gained the right to enforce their contractual rights for twelve years just as their contractual liabilities extend for that time as well.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b707-6\">For all these reasons, the case should not be dismissed at all and certainly cannot be dismissed with prejudice as there is no basis at all in law to do this.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b707-7\">After considering additional written and oral arguments, on February 29, 2008, the Circuit Court filed a <em>\u201cMEMORANDUM RULING\u201d </em>that included the following findings and conclusions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b707-8\">The purpose of Maryland Rule 2-507 has been clearly stated in case law as a means to \u201cclear the docket of dead cases.\u201d Although this Court is extremely troubled by Plaintiffs counsel lack of diligence in pursuing this matter by properly serving the defendants in this case, this Court does not believe it has authority to dismiss this case with prejudice under Maryland Rule 2-507. The Rule is not meant to punish plaintiffs for the action or inaction of \u201clax\u201d attorneys, but rather rid the docket of \u201cstale\u201d cases. Since the disputed contract in this case was \u201cunder seal\u201d the statute of limitations in this case is 12 years. This would mean that the plaintiff could have brought his lawsuit in 2008 and still have been within the applicable statute of limitations. It is therefore ORDERED that this case be DISMISSED WITHOUT PREJUDICE.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b707-9\">Dr. Hariri, Dr. Hatfield and Dr. Blaik noted timely appeals to the Court of Special Appeals. As stated above, this Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"680\">*680</page-number>issued a <em>writ of certiorari </em>to determine whether the Circuit Court erred or abused its discretion in denying Appellants\u2019 motions for dismissal \u201cwith prejudice.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b708-5\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b708-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-7\">Just as a plaintiff whose complaint is \u201cdismissed without prejudice\u201d has the right to note an appeal,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> a defendant who has argued for a \u201cdismissal with prejudice\u201d has the right to note an appeal from a \u201cdismissal without prejudice.\u201d In <em>Ferrell v. Benson, </em>352 Md. 2, 720 A.2d 583 (1998), this Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b708-8\">This Court has repeatedly held that an order \u201chaving the effect of terminating the case in the circuit court, is a final judgment.\u201d <em>Montgomery County v. Revere National Corp., </em>341 Md. 366, 378, 671 A.2d 1, 7 (1996). <em>See, e.g., Moore v. Pomory, </em>329 Md. 428, 431, 620 A.2d 323, 325 (1993) (circuit court\u2019s order dismissing complaint without prejudice is a final judgment because it \u201cputs the plaintiff out of court and terminates the particular action in [that] court\u201d); <em>Horsey v. Horsey, </em>329 Md. 392, 402, 620 A.2d 305, 310 (1993) (circuit court order requiring the parties to arbitrate their entire dispute is a final judgment, as the \u201corder effectively terminates that particular case before the trial court\u201d); <em>Wilde v. Swanson, </em>314 Md. 80, 83-87, 548 A.2d 837, 838-840 (1988) (dismissal of action on the ground of improper venue, like a dismissal for lack of jurisdiction, is a final judgment because \u201cthe plaintiffs were deprived of the means of further prosecuting their claim against [the defendant] in that court\u201d); <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number><em>Doehring v. Wagner, </em>311 Md. 272, 275, 533 A.2d 1300, 1301-1302 (1987) (circuit court\u2019s order granting the defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment was a final judgment, as the order \u201cput the plaintiffs out of court\u201d and \u201cterminated the litigation in that court\u201d); <em>Houghton v. County Com\u2019rs of Kent Co., </em>307 Md. 216, 221, 513 A.2d 291, 293 (1986).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b709-5\">The notion embraced by the defendants and the Court of Special Appeals in this case, that an order terminating the case in the circuit court is not final and appealable unless it settles the rights of the parties or concludes the cause of action, has consistently and expressly been rejected by this Court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b709-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 5-6, 720 A.2d at 585.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-7\">It is of no consequence that Appellants were defendants rather than plaintiffs. The petitioner in <em>Horsey v. Horsey, </em>329 Md. 392, 620 A.2d 305 (1993), was Mrs. Horsey, who was the defendant in the Circuit Court. When the Circuit Court ordered arbitration, it was Mrs. Horsey who noted an appeal to the Court of Special Appeals. After the Court of Special Appeals dismissed that appeal, Mrs. Horsey filed a petition for writ of certiorari with this Court. That petition was granted, and this Court ultimately held that \u201c[t]he court\u2019s order dismissing Mr. Horsey\u2019s petition of contempt/counterclaim and directing arbitration was a final and appealable judgment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 406, 620 A.2d at 312.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-8\">It is also of no consequence that Appellants \u201cprevailed\u201d in the Circuit Court in the sense that Appellees\u2019 Amended Complaint was dismissed. The ruling about which Appellants complain is the functional equivalent of an order putting them \u201cout of court\u201d on the issue of whether they are entitled to a \u201cdismissal with prejudice.\u201d We therefore hold that the ruling at issue is an appealable \u201cfinal adjudication.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b709-9\">II.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b709-10\">Maryland Rule 2-507 provides:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b710-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"682\">*682</page-number>(a) Scope. This Rule applies to all actions except actions involving the military docket and continuing trusts or guardianships.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b710-5\">(b) For lack of jurisdiction. An action against any defendant who has not been served or over whom the court has not otherwise acquired jurisdiction is subject to dismissal as to that defendant at the expiration of 120 days from the issuance of original process directed to that defendant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b710-6\">(c) For lack of prosecution. An action is subject to dismissal for lack of prosecution at the expiration of one year from the last docket entry, other than an entry made under this Rule, Rule 2-131, or Rule 2-132, except that an action for limited divorce or for permanent alimony is subject to dismissal under this section only after two years from the last such docket entry.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b710-7\">(d) Notification of contemplated dismissal. When an action is subject to dismissal pursuant to this Rule, the clerk, upon written request of a party or upon the clerk\u2019s own initiative, shall serve a notice on all parties pursuant to Rule 1-321 that an order of dismissal for lack of jurisdiction or prosecution will be entered after the expiration of 30 days unless a motion is filed under section (e) of this Rule.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b710-8\">(e) Deferral of dismissal. On motion filed at any time before 30 days after service of the notice, the court for good cause shown may defer entry of the order of dismissal for the period and on the terms it deems proper.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b710-9\">(f) Entry of dismissal. If a motion has not been filed under section (e) of this Rule, the clerk shall enter on the docket \u201cDismissed for lack of jurisdiction or prosecution without prejudice\u201d 30 days after service of the notice. If a motion is filed and denied, the clerk shall make the entry promptly after the denial.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b710-10\">Appellants argue that the Circuit Court committed an error of law when it concluded that it does not have the \u201cauthority to dismiss this case with prejudice under Md. Rule 2-507.\u201d This argument, however, was waived by (1) Dr. Hariri on September 19, 2007, when he filed his \u201cANSWER <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"683\">*683</page-number>TO COMPLAINT,\u201d (2) Dr. Blaik on October 29, 2007, when he filed his \u201cMOTION TO DISMISS ..and (3) Dr. Belle on November 6, 2007, when he filed his \u201cANSWER TO COMPLAINT.\u201d While Appellants were entitled to argue that they were entitled to a dismissal because Appellees had failed to comply with the requirements of Md. Rule 2-507(b), an argument for \u201cdismissal for lack of jurisdiction\u201d is waived unless it complies with Md. Rule 2-322(a), which requires that the defense of \u201clack of jurisdiction over the person\u201d be asserted \u201cby motion to dismiss filed before the answer,\u201d and which provides that, \u201c[i]f not so made and the answer is filed, [that defense is] waived.\u201d As this Court stated in <em>McCormick v. St. Francis de Sales Church, </em>219 Md. 422, 149 A.2d 768 (1959), \u201c[a] person who denies that a court has jurisdiction and asks relief on that ground cannot ask anything of the court which is inconsistent with the want of such jurisdiction.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 429, 149 A.2d at 772.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-5\">Although Dr. Hatfield has not waived his right to argue that he is entitled to a dismissal with prejudice,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> there is no merit in this argument, which is unsupported by either the words or the history of Md. Rule 2-507(b).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In <em>Johnson v. State, </em>360 Md. 250, 757 A.2d 796 (2000), this Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b712-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"684\">*684</page-number>With respect to the interpretation of the Maryland Rules, this Court has stated that, \u201c[t]he canons and principles which we follow in construing statutes apply equally to an interpretation of our rules.\u201d <em>State v. Romulus, </em>315 Md. 526, 533, 555 A.2d 494, 497 (1989). In order to effectuate the purpose and objectives of the rule, we look to its plain text. See Adamson v. <em>Correctional Medical Serv., Inc., </em>359 Md. 238, 250-51, 753 A.2d 501, 507-08 (2000); <em>Huffman v. State, </em>356 Md. 622, 628, 741 A.2d 1088, 1091 (1999). To prevent illogical or nonsensical interpretations of a rule, we analyze the rule in its entirety, rather than independently construing its sub-parts. <em>See Marsheck v. Board of Trustees of the Fire &amp; Police Employees\u2019 Retirement System of the City of Baltimore, </em>358 Md. 393, 403, 749 A.2d 774, 779 (2000). If the words of the rule are plain and unambiguous, our inquiry ordinarily ceases and we need not venture outside the text of the rule. <em>See Adamson, </em>359 Md. at 250-51, 753 A.2d at 507-08; <em>Marsheck, </em>358 Md. at 402-03, 749 A.2d at 779; <em>Huffman, </em>356 Md. at 628, 741 A.2d at 1091.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b712-5\">The venerable plain meaning principle, central to our analysis, does not, however, mandate exclusion of other persuasive sources that lie outside the text of the rule. <em>See Adamson, </em>359 Md. at 251-52, 753 A.2d at 508; <em>Marsheck, </em>358 Md. at 403, 749 A.2d at 779. We have often noted that looking to relevant case law and appropriate secondary authority enables us to place the rule in question in the proper context. <em>See Adamson, </em>359 Md. at 251-52, 753 A.2d at 508; <em>Marsheck, 358 Md. </em>at 403, 749 A.2d at 779.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b712-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 264-65, 757 A.2d at 804.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-7\">When an action is dismissed for a violation of Md. Rule 2-507, the plain language of the rule expressly provides that the dismissal entered on the docket be \u201cwithout prejudice.\u201d The express direction that the action be dismissed \u201cwithout preju<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"685\">*685</page-number>dice\u201d was included in the first \u201cDismissal lor lack of Prosecution\u201d rule, then designed as Rule 530, which took effect on November 6, 1967. No change was made to that express direction when Md. Rule 530 was amended (effective July 1, 1975) to add dismissal \u201cfor lack of service\u201d to dismissal for \u201clack of prosecution\u201d as a basis for disposing of inactive cases. The authors of <em>Maryland Rules Commentary </em>have noted that Md. Rule 2-507 \u201cbrought forward the substance of former Rule 530, with changes only in style.\u201d Paul V. Niemeyer, Linda M. Schuett, John A. Lynch, Jr., &amp; Richard W. Bourne, <em>Maryland Rules Commentary </em>391 (3rd ed. 2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b713-5\">Appellants have cited\u2014to the Circuit Court, and to this Court\u2014\u201cthe holding of <em>Reed v. Cagan,\u201d </em>128 Md.App. 641, 739 A.2d 932 (1999), <em>cert. denied </em>357 Md. 483, 745 A.2d 437 (2000), in support of their argument that dismissal \u201cwith prejudice\u201d is a permissible sanction for a violation of Md. Rule 2-507(b). The only consequential issue in that case, however, was the issue of whether a \u201cbelatedly served defendant\u201d has the right to move for a dismissal \u201cfor lack of jurisdiction\u201d if the clerk of court has not filed a notice of contemplated dismissal. <em>Reed </em>involved the dismissal of a negligence action asserted by the appellant,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> who was born on May 6, 1975, and\u2014under the \u201ccoming of age rule\u201d established in <em>Mason v. Board of Education, </em>375 Md. 504, 514, 826 A.2d 433, 438 (2003)\u2014\u201cattained 18 years of age\u201d on May 5, 1993. That action was (1) filed by the appellant on May 3, 1996, (2) not served on the appellee until April 6, 1998, and (3) dismissed \u201cwith prejudice\u201d on July 6, 1998. Because the applicable statute of limitations had expired at the end of the day on May 5, 1996,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> it was of no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"686\">*686</page-number>consequence whether the dismissal was \u201cwith prejudice\u201d or \u201cwithout prejudice.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b714-5\">Moreover, it would be contrary to common sense to hold that\u2014even though Appellees could file suit against him as late as the twelfth anniversary of the day he allegedly breached a contract that he signed \u201cunder seal\u201d on October 3, 2000\u2014Dr. Hatfield was entitled to a dismissal with prejudice on the ground that service of a complaint filed against him on February 7, 2005 was not made in conformity with the requirements of Md. Rule 2-507(b). For these reasons, we agree with the Circuit Court\u2019s conclusion that it did not \u201chave the authority to dismiss this case with prejudice under Md. Rule 2-507.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b714-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-7\">The \u201cabuse of discretion\u201d standard of review is applicable to the issue of whether an appellate court should reverse the Circuit Court\u2019s decision to dismiss an action for \u201clack of jurisdiction.\u201d In <em>Flanagan v. Department of Human Resources, Baltimore City Office of Child Support Enforcement Ex Rel. Baltimore City Department of Social Services, </em>412 Md. 616, 989 A.2d 1139 (2010), this Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b714-8\">Rule 2-507(b) provides that failure to serve the defendant within 120 days from the issuance of original process merely makes the action \u201csubject to dismissal.\u201d Whether to dismiss rests in the sound discretion of a trial judge in the first instance, based on his or her weighing of the balance of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"687\">*687</page-number>rights, interests, and reasons of the parties for the delay and the public demand for prompt resolution of litigation. <em>Langrall, Muir &amp; Noppinger v. Gladding, </em>282 Md. 397, 400-01, 384 A.2d 737, 739 (1978).

John Crane, Inc., </em>385 Md. 185, 867 A.2d 1077 (2005), for example, we iterated</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ADF\">[t]here is an abuse of discretion \u201cwhere no reasonable person would take the view adopted by the [trial] courtf ]\u201d... or when the court acts \u201cwithout reference to any guiding principles.\u201d An abuse of discretion may also be found where the ruling under consideration is \u201cclearly against the logic and effect of facts and inferences before the court[ ]\u201d... or when the ruling is \u201cviolative of fact and logic.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b715-7\">Questions within the discretion of the trial court are \u201cmuch better decided by the trial judges than by appellate courts, and the decisions of such judges should [only] be disturbed where it is apparent that some serious error or abuse of discretion or autocratic action has occurred.\u201d In sum, to be reversed \u201c[t]he decision under consideration has to be well removed from any center mark imagined by the reviewing court and beyond the fringe of what that court deems minimally acceptable.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b715-8\">385 Md. at 198-99, 867 A.2d at 1084 (quoting <em>In re Adoption/Guardianship No.3598, </em>347 Md. 295, 312-13, 701 A.2d 110, 118-19 (1997)). An abuse of discretion, therefore, \u201cshould only be found in the extraordinary, exceptional, or most egregious case.\u201d <em>Wilson, </em>385 Md. at 199, 867 A.2d at 1084.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b715-9\"><em>Id. </em>at 418-19, 914 A.2d at 121.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-10\">From our review of the record, we hold that the Circuit Court\u2019s decision to dismiss Appellees\u2019 action did not constitute <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"688\">*688</page-number>an abuse of discretion. \u201cThe 120-day period [within which the plaintiff must serve the defendant] is measured from the first issuance of original process directed to that defendant, not from the last issuance of process.\u201d Paul V. Niemeyer, Linda M. Schuett, John A. Lynch, Jr., &amp; Richard W. Bourne, <em>Maryland Rules Commentary </em>391-92 (3rd ed. 2003). The complaint filed by Appellees on October 14, 2003, and which was never served, became \u201csubject to dismissal\u201d at the end of the day on February 11, 2004. The complaint filed by Appellees on February 7, 2005, became \u201csubject to dismissal\u201d at the end of the day on June 7, 2005. In light of the defendants\u2019 addresses provided in those complaints, it is clear that the decision at issue was not \u201cbeyond the fringe of what [the Circuit Court] deems minimally acceptable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b716-5\">The record also shows, however, that (1) no notification of contemplated dismissal was issued until September 14, 2007, eight days after Dr. Hariri and Dr. Blaik had been served, (2) no dismissal order had been entered by November 13, 2007, when Appellees filed their Amended Complaint, and (3) no dismissal order had been entered by November 15, 2007, when Dr. Hatfield filed his motion to dismiss. Under these circumstances, in light of the fact that Appellees had until the end of the day on the twelfth anniversary of the alleged breach to file suit against Appellants,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> a denial of Appellants\u2019 motions to dismiss would not have constituted an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-6\">JUDGMENTS AFFIRMED; APPELLANTS TO PAY THE COSTS.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b704-12\">.

The Amended Complaint asserted that (1) Dr. Hariri signed his contract on October 3, 2000, (2) Dr. Blaik signed his contract on October 8, 1998, (3) Dr. Belle signed his contract on \"February 15th 2002\u201d and breached this contract \"in 1997,\u201d (4) Dr. Hatfield signed his contract on October 30, 2003, and (5) Dr. Mutale signed her contract \u201cin 2004.\u201d The date that Dr. McNeil allegedly signed his contact was not stated.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b708-9\">. In <em>Moore v.

Rather, the case is fully terminated in the trial court.... The effect of the designation \"without prejudice\u201d is simply that there is no adjudication on the merits and that, therefore, a new suit on the same cause of action is not barred by principles of res judicata.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b708-11\"><em>Id. </em>at 432, 620 A.2d at 325.

Although the record does not show when Dr. Hatfield was served with a copy of the complaint, he moved for dismissal \"with prejudice\u201d on November 15, 2007, and noted an appeal from the Circuit Court's refusal to grant that relief.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b711-7\">. The history of this rule includes the minutes of the April, 1987 meetings at which the Rules Committee rejected a proposed amendment that would have, if adopted, added the following section:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b711-8\">(g) Power of Court Not Limited</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b711-9\">The provisions of this Rule do not limit any power of the court, upon motion and for good cause shown, to dismiss an action without prejudice for failure to prosecute or to comply with an order of court. The minutes show that the Committee ultimately decided against</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ArI\">recommending the addition of section (g) out of concern that such an amendment would have the unintended consequence of implying that the Circuit Court could not dismiss <em>any </em>case \"with prejudice\u201d unless that disposition was expressly authorized by statute or rule. The minutes also show that, during the discussion, the Chair of the Trial Subcommittee proposed that the words \"without prejudice\u201d be deleted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"684\">*684</page-number>from section (g). The fact that no other Committee member agreed with that proposal clearly shows that, in the opinion of the Rules Committee, the only permissible sanction for a violation of Md. Rule 2-507 is a dismissal <em>without prejudice. </em>Standing Committee on Rules of Practice &amp; Procedure, Meeting Minutes April 24-25, 1987.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b713-6\">.

In <em>Mason, supra, </em>the plaintiff/petitioner was born on April 4, 1979. On April 4, 2000, she filed a complaint in the Circuit Court, based upon a series of events that occurred while she was fourteen years old.

Under the coming of age rule, she attained 18 years of age on April 3, 1997, and the disability was removed as of that date. Under our statutory method of computation, April 3, 1997, the date of removal of the disability, was not included in the three-year period. <em>See </em>Maryland Code Art. 1, \u00a7 36. Thus, the statute of limitations began to run on April 4, 1997, and ended April 3, 2000.
