The case was tried in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City, where a jury found against Houghton and awarded compensatory damages to Forrest. On appeal, Houghton argued that the trial verdict should be overturned on grounds of governmental immunity. Because common law public official immunity does not apply to intentional torts, and Houghton cannot identify any other statutory basis for immunity, we will affirm the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals with respect to both immunity and the operation of the Local Government Tort Claims Act <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>(\u201cLGTCA\u201d); we need not reach the malice issue, and will therefore vacate that part of the judgment below.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-5\">FACTUAL &amp; PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b611-6\">On the morning of May 25, 2005, Houghton observed a drug sale on North Eutaw Street in Baltimore City through a security camera feed. Three persons participated in the sale: the drug dealer, a male purchaser, and an alleged female purchaser who was wearing a white shirt or coat. As the transaction was being completed, Houghton contacted an arresting team, comprising Officer Timothy Williams and another officer, and instructed them to arrest the participants in the sale. The arresting team took the dealer and the male purchaser into custody, finding drugs on each of them, but the alleged female purchaser had left the scene. Houghton then witnessed, through the video feed, the alleged female purchaser embrace a second woman nearby. Houghton assumed that the embrace concealed the transfer or sale of drugs from the female purchaser to the second woman. This second woman was wearing a black jacket, dark jeans, and carrying a red umbrella. Houghton moved the camera back to the arrest, and in doing so, lost sight of the second woman.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-7\">After monitoring the arrest, Houghton scanned the area for the female purchaser and the second woman. The female purchaser was no longer in view, but Houghton could see someone whom he believed to be the second woman. In fact, the person in Houghton\u2019s view was Forrest, who was standing some distance away at a nearby bus stop. Forrest was wearing different colored pants and jacket than the second woman, though both were carrying red umbrellas. Houghton instructed Williams to arrest Forrest. Williams approached Forrest, and asked if she had \u201canything illegal\u201d on her person; Forrest said she did not, and consented to a search of her person. The search revealed no contraband, but Houghton nonetheless instructed Williams to arrest Forrest. Williams suggested that Houghton review the video footage to make certain that Forrest was indeed the second woman. Houghton did not do so, but nonetheless confirmed that Forrest was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>to be arrested. Williams handcuffed and arrested Forrest, over Forrest\u2019s protests, and placed her with the other arrestees. Forrest testified at trial that she overheard Williams discussing the possibility that he may have arrested the wrong person, and that Williams was instructed to take her into custody nonetheless. Forrest was moved to Central Booking, though she was not summoned to court and charges against her were eventually dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-5\">In December 2006, Forrest filed suit against Houghton and Williams, alleging numerous intentional torts including assault, battery, false arrest, and false imprisonment, as well as violations of Articles 24 and 26 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights. At trial in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City, a jury found that Williams was immune from liability, but that Houghton had acted with malice (and therefore that immunity did not apply), and that Houghton was liable on almost all counts. The jury awarded $171.60 in actual damages, $180,000.00 in compensatory damages, and no punitive damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-6\">Houghton appealed the verdict on the grounds that there was insufficient evidence in the trial court to support a finding of malice, and that he was thus immune from liability. <em>See Houghton v. Forrest, </em>183 Md.App. 15, 21-22, 959 A.2d 816, 819-20 (2008). Forrest responded that the evidence was sufficient, and alternatively, that the trial court erred in requiring a finding of actual malice because public official immunity does not apply to intentional torts. <em>Id. </em>On appeal, the Court of Special Appeals held that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b612-7\">(1) common law public official immunity does not apply to intentional torts, and there are no other applicable bases for immunity, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b612-8\">(2) the evidence at trial was insufficient to support a finding of malice.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b612-9\"><em>Id. </em>The Court of Special Appeals further held that the insufficient evidence on malice was not a bar to Forrest\u2019s recovery, as the LGTCA allows Forrest to enforce her claim against the Baltimore City Police Department. Houghton <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>appeals the first holding, and Forrest cross-appeals on the second holding.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b613-6\">We must resolve two issues in order to completely address this case: first, whether Houghton is immune from liability on either statutory or common law grounds; second, how the operation of the LGTCA affects the application of the judgment against Houghton. We discuss each issue in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-7\">Immunity</p>\n<p id=\"b613-8\">Houghton did not make clear in the proceedings below what particular source of immunity he relies upon for his claim. In his briefs to this Court, and during oral argument, Houghton focused primarily on the application of common law public official immunity. We will address this issue below. In addition, because official immunity may derive from any one of several provisions in the Maryland code, we will examine all other possible sources for Houghton\u2019s immunity as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-9\">\n<em>Common Law Public Official Immunity</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b613-10\">Houghton claims immunity from judgment under a common law theory of public official immunity. Common law public official immunity is reserved for public officials (as opposed to mere employees) who perform negligent acts during the course of their discretionary (as opposed to ministerial) duties. <em>See James v. Prince George\u2019s County, </em>288 Md. 315, 323, 418 A.2d 1173, 1178 (1980). We have held that police officers are public officials. <em>Smith v. Danielczyk, </em>400 Md. 98, 128-29, 928 A.2d 795, 813 (2007). Moreover, there is no question that Houghton\u2019s arrest of Forrest was a discretionary act, and not a ministerial one: we have long held that the word \u201c \u2018discretion\u2019 denotes freedom to act according to one\u2019s judgment in the absence of a hard and fast rule.\u201d <em>Schneider v. Hawkins, </em>179 Md. 21, 25, 16 A.2d 861, 864 (1940). The order to arrest an individual falls squarely within that definition. So, both criteria that this Court set forth in <em>James </em>are met here.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>For more than twenty years, however, this Court has held that common law public official immunity does not apply to intentional torts.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>See Lee v. Cline, </em>384 Md. 245, 258, 863 A.2d 297, 305 (2004) (\u201cThe Maryland public official immunity doctrine is quite limited and is generally applicable only in negligence actions or defamation actions based on allegedly negligent conduct.\u201d); <em>Cox v. Prince George\u2019s County, </em>296 Md. 162, 169, 460 A.2d 1038, 1041 (1983) (\u201ca police officer does not enjoy this [public official] immunity if he commits an intentional tort\u201d).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In spite of these holdings, Houghton asks us to apply this immunity to officials committing intentional torts. But this Court will not overturn precedent in a vacuum, nor do so on a whim. <em>See, e.g., Townsend v. Bethlehem-Fairfield Shipyard, Inc., </em>186 Md. 406, 417, 47 A.2d 365, 370 (1946) (\u201c[I]t is a well recognized and valuable doctrine that decisions, once made ... should not thereafter be lightly disturbed or set aside.... \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b614-5\">Our \u201cinstitutional devotion to stare decisis is not absolute,\u201d <em>State v. Adams, </em>406 Md. 240, 259, 958 A.2d 295, 307 (2008), but we nonetheless remain deeply respectful of the doctrine. Adherence to stare decisis is our \u201cpreferred course because it promotes the evenhanded, predictable, and consistent development of legal principles, fosters reliance on judicial decisions, and contributes to the actual and perceived integrity of the judicial process.\u201d <em>Livesay v. Balt. County, </em>384 Md. 1, 14, 862 A.2d 33, 40-41 (2004) <em>(quoting Payne v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number><em>Tennessee, </em>501 U.S. 808, 827, 111 S.Ct. 2597, 2609, 115 L.Ed.2d 720 (1991)). Only a fundamental change in factual or legal circumstances will justify departing from this principle. If the state of the law as a whole has evolved, for example, so as to render a rule nothing more than \u201ca remnant of [an] abandoned doctrine,\u201d then we would be justified in correspondingly abandoning that rule. <em>See Planned Parenthood of Se. Pa. v. Casey, </em>505 U.S. 833, 854-55, 112 S.Ct. 2791, 2808, 120 L.Ed.2d 674 (1992) (joint op.). Alternately, if our understanding of the factual underpinnings of a rule has changed unto the point where the rule is no longer justified by the status quo, then there is no reason to adhere to the rule obstinately. <em>See id. </em>at 860, 112 S.Ct. at 2811-12 (discussing the relationship between factual divergence and stare decisis). Likewise, if experience demonstrates that it is unrealistic or unwise to enforce a rule in the form expressed by this Court, then it may be modified for practical reasons. <em>Id. </em>at 854-55, 112 S.Ct. at 2808.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-4\">Here, Houghton has shown us no reason to deviate from our rule denying common-law immunity to public officials who commit intentional torts. Houghton has not presented any evidence, either in his brief or at oral argument, that the factual or legal landscape with regard to public official immunity has changed unto the point where we would be justified in departing from our precedents. Houghton advances a general policy argument, relying on language in <em>Lee, </em>where we stated that public official immunity is \u201cintended to be a defense against claims that a \u2018better choice\u2019 could have been made by an official.\u201d 384 Md. at 261, 863 A.2d at 307. This is an accurate restatement of the purposes behind the public official immunity doctrine, but it does not support Houghton\u2019s position. Indeed, our very next sentence in <em>Lee </em>states that \u201c[t]his defense is inherently related to actions based on negligence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We have not deviated from this principle throughout our cases addressing public official immunity. <em>See, e.g., Lee, </em>384 Md. at 258, 863 A.2d at 305; <em>DiPino v. Davis, </em>354 Md. 18, 49, 729 A.2d 354, 370 (1999) (\u201c[A] police officer, who might other<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>wise have the benefit of this immunity, does not enjoy it if the officer commits an intentional tort .... \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b616-5\">Houghton\u2019s actions are therefore not of the type that we have intended to protect through application of common law public official immunity. As Houghton has provided no other reason for us to overrule our precedents, we affirm our previous holdings that common law public official immunity does not apply to intentional torts other than defamation. Houghton thus cannot claim such immunity in defense of the judgment against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-6\">\n<em>Municipal Official Immunity and the Maryland Tort Claims Act</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b616-7\">Maryland public officials may also claim immunity for their official acts on statutory grounds. Under Courts &amp; Judicial Proceedings Article (\u201cCJ\u201d) Section 5-507(b), officials of municipal corporations are entitled to limited immunity. <em>See </em>Md.Code (2006 RepLVol.), \u00a7 5-507 of the Courts &amp; Judicial Proceedings Article. Likewise, certain public officials can claim immunity under the Maryland Tort Claims Act (\u201cMTCA\u201d), which defines the State\u2019s limited waiver of sovereign immunity with respect to tort suits against public officials. <em>See </em>Md.Code (2004 RepLVol.), \u00a7 \u00a7 12-101 to -10 of the State Government Article (\u201cSG\u201d) (the Maryland Tort Claims Act). As the Court of Special Appeals correctly held, neither of these statutes applies in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-8\">First, municipal official immunity under CJ Section 5-507(b) does not apply because the BCPD was created as a state agency, through an act of the General Assembly, and not as a municipal agency. <em>See </em>1867 Md. Laws 761-74 (establishing the BCPD and defining its duties); <em>see also Mayor &amp; City Council of Balt. v. Clark, </em>404 Md. 13, 28, 944 A.2d 1122, 1131 (2008) (holding that \u201cnotwithstanding the Mayor\u2019s role in appointing and removing the City\u2019s Police Commissioner, the Baltimore City Police Department is a state agency.\u201d). Since that time, \u201cthis Court has consistently held that Baltimore City should not be regarded as the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>employer of members of the [BCPD] for purposes of tort liability.\u201d <em>Clea v. Mayor of Balt., </em>312 Md. 662, 668, 541 A.2d 1303, 1306 (1988). Thus, for the purposes of tort liability, Houghton is an employee of a state agency and not a municipal agency. He therefore cannot claim to be a municipal official, and cannot claim municipal official immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-4\">Second, Houghton cannot claim immunity under the MTCA because although the BCPD is a state agency, city police are not defined as state personnel for the purposes of the MTCA. <em>See </em>SG \u00a7 12-101(a) (enumerating classes of officials within the scope of the MTCA). This is no mere oversight: the General Assembly amended the statute after our decision in <em>Clea, </em>where we discussed in dicta the possibility that the state might be liable for a BCPD officer\u2019s tortious conduct because the BCPD is a state agency. <em>See Clea, </em>312 Md. at 671 n. 6, 541 A.2d at 1307 n. 6. Shortly thereafter, the General Assembly enacted House Bill 364, for \u201cthe purpose of altering the definition of State personnel [under the MTCA].\u201d <em>See </em>H.B. 364, 1989 Gen. Assem., 406th Sess. (Md.1989). The newly modified statute helped clarify that the bounds of immunity and liability under the MTCA applied only to individuals directly paid by or otherwise under direct control of the state itself. <em>See id.; see also State v. Meade, </em>101 Md.App. 512, 522-24, 647 A.2d 830, 834-36 (1994) (discussing history of the 1989 amendment).</p>\n<p id=\"b617-5\">The state thus reaffirmed the preservation of its sovereign immunity for acts committed by municipal police, including members of the BCPD.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>See Balt. Police Dep\u2019t v. Cherkes, </em>140 Md.App. 282, 313-14, 780 A.2d 410, 428-29 (2001) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>(discussing the amendment process). In doing so, however, it also necessarily excluded municipal police, including Houghton, from the scope of the MTCA. As Houghton is a municipal police officer, the MTCA neither defines his responsibilities nor denies him protections with respect to immunity. The statute is simply inapplicable to Houghton\u2019s situation, and he cannot seek shelter beneath it.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-5\">\n<em>\u201cGovernmental Official\u201d Immunity</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AcT\">The final statutory basis for immunity that could be applicable in this case derives from CJ Section 5-511(b), which creates immunity for officials \u201cof a governmental entity----\u201d <em>See </em>CJ \u00a7 5-511. The code defines \u201cgovernmental entity\u201d as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b618-8\">(b) <em>Governmental </em>entity.\u2014\u201cGovernmental entity\u201d means a special taxing district which:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b618-9\">(1) Is a unit of government responsible for an area situated solely within a single county;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b618-10\">(2) Has a governing body elected independently of the county government;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b618-11\">(3) Is financed with revenues secured in whole or in part from special taxes or assessments levied on real property situated within the area;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b618-12\">(4) Performs municipal services for the residents of the area; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b618-13\">(5) Was not created for a limited or special purpose or purposes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b618-14\">Md.Code (2005 Repl.Vol.), Article 26, \u00a7 1(b). The same Section defines an official of a governmental entity as \u201ca member of the governing body of a governmental entity.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 1(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b618-15\">We agree with the Court of Special Appeals that the immunity defined in these provisions is inapplicable to Houghton. In this case, we need not investigate the legislative history of the statutory provision, as a plain reading of the statute resolves our questions. As we said in <em>Smith v. State, </em>399 Md. 565, 924 A.2d 1175 (2007), \u201c[o]ur goal, when interpret<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>ing statutes, is to identify and effectuate the legislative intent underlying the statute(s) at issue. The best source of legislative intent is the statute\u2019s plain language, and when the language is clear and unambiguous, our inquiry ordinarily ends there.\u201d Smith, 399 Md. at 578, 924 A.2d at 1182 (citations and quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b619-5\">Here, we cannot reasonably construe the statute\u2019s plain language to cover either Houghton or the BCPD. Section 1(b) states that a \u201cgovernmental entity\u201d must at the very least be a \u201cspecial taxing district.... \u201d A special taxing district is an area designated by a municipality in which a special tax is levied, through a grant of authority from the General Assembly, in order to fund specific public works and construction projects. <em>See </em>Md.Code (2005 RepLVol.), Article 23A, \u00a7 44(a); <em>see also </em>Mark M. Viani, Maryland Local Government Law and Structure 3-34 (1999) (\u201cA special tax district is a district created to derive additional revenue from the taxpayers within the district.\u201d). This cannot possibly be said of the BCPD, which thus is not a \u201cgovernmental entity\u201d for the purposes of CJ Section 5\u2014511(b). This statutory immunity thus cannot apply in this case.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b619-6\">Malice &amp; The Local Government Tort Claims Act</p>\n<p id=\"b619-7\">On cross-appeal, Forrest argues that the Court of Special Appeals erred in holding that there was insufficient evidence to support a finding that Houghton acted with malice. <em>See Houghton, </em>183 Md.App. at 26-30, 959 A.2d at 822-25. We hold that because of the operation of the Local Government Tort Claims Act, there is no need for this Court to reach the malice issue. <em>See </em>CJ \u00a7\u00a7 5-301 to -99.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-8\">The LGTCA limits liability, provides for indemnification, and establishes procedural requirements relating to suits against officials of local government authorities. It expressly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>applies to suits against employees of the BCPD. <em>See </em>CJ \u00a7 5-301(d)(21) (defining the BCPD as \u201c[ljocal government\u201d for the purposes of the act). In this case, it ensures that the BCPD will be liable for the judgment against Houghton. The LGTCA states in part that, except with respect to punitive damages, \u201ca local government shall be liable for any judgment against its employee for damages resulting from tortious acts\u201d within the employee\u2019s scope of employment. CJ \u00a7 5-303(b)(1). We have previously held that the test for determining whether acts were within the scope of employment is whether the challenged acts were in furtherance of the employer\u2019s business and could be fairly termed \u201cincident to the performance of duties entrusted to\u201d the employee. <em>See Ennis v. Crenca, </em>322 Md. 285, 293-94, 587 A.2d 485, 489-90 (1991). That is surely the case here, as Houghton\u2019s arrest of Forrest was incident to his general authority as a police officer. His actions would therefore be within the scope of his employment regardless.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-4\">The LGTCA thus ensures that the BCPD is liable for the judgment against Houghton.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> During oral argument counsel for Forrest stated that his client sought only to obtain a judgment collectable against BCPD. Once we have made this determination, Forrest\u2019s claim has been adjudicated. Although Section 5-302 of the LGTCA allows the BCPD to seek indemnification from Houghton if he acted with malice, the legal relationship between Houghton and the BCPD is not at issue in this case. <em>See </em>CJ \u00a7 5-302(b)(2). We therefore need not determine it; if the BCPD elects to pursue Houghton for indemnification at a later date, an assessment of Houghton\u2019s malice or lack thereof can be addressed during those proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b621-5\">We hold that Houghton cannot claim immunity for his intentional torts against Forrest because common law public official immunity does not apply to the commission of those torts. Nor is there any statutory source of immunity that would protect Houghton\u2019s actions. We also hold that there is no reason to determine if Houghton acted with malice, as the BCPD is liable for the judgment against Houghton regardless. Forrest is thus entitled to collect her judgment directly from the BCPD. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals with respect to the immunity issue, and vacate the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals with respect to the malice issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-6\">JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS AFFIRMED IN PART AND VACATED IN PART. COSTS IN THIS COURT AND IN THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS TO BE PAID BY THE PETITIONER.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b614-6\">.
