To reach a decision, we must consider whether the odor of ether, a lawful substance that is allegedly associated with contraband, constitutes probable cause to support an arrest when the arrestee, who is standing in a high crime drug area, has the odor of ether emanating from his person, and fails to respond to police questions. We shall hold that the totality of the circumstances do not provide a concrete reason to associate the odor of ether with criminal activity or contraband, and, accordingly, the officer did not have probable cause to arrest the petitioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-11\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-12\">On the night of August 16, 2006, Officer Rodney Lewis of the Prince George\u2019s County Police Department was patrolling the 6800 block of Hawthorne Street in Landover, Maryland. The area was known for drug activity, though there were no specific complaints on the night in question. At approximately 11:35 P.M., while patrolling on foot, Officer Lewis spotted the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>petitioner, Robert Bailey, standing alone on the side of 6890 Hawthorne Street. Officer Lewis testified about the encounter at the suppression hearing:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-4\">... I observed the defendant standing on the side of a home, ... just standing in the shadows, at which time I yelled out to him, \u201cExcuse me, sir, do you live there?\u201d I didn\u2019t get any acknowledgment from the individual, at which time I assumed that he probably didn\u2019t hear me. I repeated the same thing, \u201cExcuse me, sir, do you live there,\u201d which again I received no acknowledgment from the suspect, at which time myself, along with another officer, walked over to the individual. At that time, I just happened to step out of the shallow [sic] area on the sidewalk where I could visibly see his hands. And from the area at which he was standing at the time, I could smell a strong odor of ether ...</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b387-5\">When Officer Lewis smelled the odor of ether, he was within a few feet of the petitioner, close enough to \u201creach out and touch him.\u201d The odor was emanating \u201c[f]rom [the petitioner\u2019s] body odor.\u201d The odor of ether, according to Officer Lewis\u2019s testimony, is associated with phencyclidine, more commonly known as PCP.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Officer Lewis acknowledged on cross-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>examination that it is not illegal to possess ether and that ether is a solvent that is used in several household products. Upon smelling the odor of ether, Officer Lewis \u201creached over and grabbed both of [the petitioner\u2019s] hands and ... had him place them over top of his head.\u201d Officer Lewis then conducted a search of the petitioner, which uncovered a glass vial, approximately three to four inches in length and one inch in diameter, half-full of liquid,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> in the petitioner\u2019s right front pants pocket. Field tests confirmed that the liquid contained PCP, and the petitioner was subsequently taken into custody and charged with possession of a controlled dangerous substance.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-5\">People under the influence of PCP, according to Officer Lewis\u2019s testimony, \u201cpossess various strengths, sometimes they could be incoherent in reference to trying to understand if someone is saying something to them, and very glossy [sic] eyes____\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Officer Lewis did not explain what he meant by \u201cglossy\u201d eyes or elaborate any further. In addition to observing the odor of ether, Officer Lewis noted that the petitioner had \u201cglossy eyes\u201d and that the petitioner failed to respond to the inquiries about whether he lived in the house. Officer Lewis did not, however, indicate whether he observed the petitioner\u2019s glossy eyes before or after he initially seized the petitioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-8\">The petitioner moved to suppress the physical evidence recovered from the search, asserting that the glass vial was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>the fruit of an illegal search and seizure under the Fourth Amendment, as well as the Maryland Declaration of Rights. Following a suppression hearing at which Officer Lewis was the sole witness, the trial court found that Officer Lewis had reasonable articulable suspicion to stop and question the petitioner based on the smell of ether, the petitioner\u2019s failure to respond to Officer Lewis\u2019s questions,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and the petitioner\u2019s presence in a \u201chigh crime drug area with a number of complaints from citizens.\u201d The suppression court also determined that Officer Lewis conducted a valid pat-down of the petitioner for \u201cofficer safety\u201d and that, based on the totality of the circumstances, the search and seizure were valid.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-4\">The petitioner proceeded to trial on an Agreed Statement of Facts. The State entered a nol pros as to the first count, possession of a controlled dangerous substance with intent to distribute. Based upon the Agreed Statement of Facts, the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County entered verdicts of guilty to the second count, possession of a controlled dangerous substance, and sentenced the petitioner to four years in prison, all but two years suspended, with three years of supervised probation upon release.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-5\">The petitioner filed a timely appeal to the Court of Special Appeals. The intermediate appellate court, in an unreported opinion, affirmed the judgment of the trial court. The court determined that Officer Lewis had a reasonable, articulable suspicion to conduct an investigatory stop based on the odor of ether, the petitioner\u2019s \u201cglossy\u201d eyes, the petitioner\u2019s presence \u201cin the shadows\u201d in a high drug crime area, and the petitioner\u2019s failure to respond to Officer Lewis\u2019s inquiries. The court also held that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b389-6\">the officer\u2019s testimony did not provide a basis for a frisk, [but] it did provide probable cause for arresting [the petitioner] for the possession of illegal drugs and hence search<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>ing him. That is to say, although Officer Lewis did not articulate a reasonable suspicion for believing [the petitioner] had weapons in his possession, he did have probable cause to arrest [the petitioner] for the possession of unlawful drugs, and therefore he had the lawful authority to conduct a search incident to that arrest.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b390-4\">The court based its probable cause determination on \u201cthe smell of material clearly associated with illegal drugs ... combined with both the appearance and conduct of [the petitioner],\u201d specifically his \u201cglossy\u201d eyes, failure to respond to Officer Lewis\u2019s inquiries, and presence in a high drug crime area \u201cstanding in the shadows at 11:30 p.m. ... back off the street, well in the shadows.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b390-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-6\">\u201cWhen reviewing the disposition of a motion to suppress evidence alleged to have been seized in contravention of the Fourth Amendment ..., we view the evidence adduced at the suppression hearing, and the inferences fairly deducible therefrom, in the light most favorable to the party that prevailed on the motion.\u201d <em>Crosby v. State, </em>408 Md. 490, 504, 970 A.2d 894, 902 (2009); <em>Longshore v. State, </em>399 Md. 486, 498, 924 A.2d 1129, 1135 (2007). The appellate court defers to the trial court\u2019s fact-finding at the suppression hearing, unless the trial court\u2019s findings were clearly erroneous. <em>Crosby, </em>408 Md. at 504-05, 970 A.2d at 902. \u201cNevertheless, in resolving the ultimate question of whether the detention or attendant search of an individual\u2019s person or property violates the Fourth Amendment, we \u2018make our own independent constitutional appraisal by reviewing the law and applying it to the facts of the case.\u2019 \u201d <em>Crosby, </em>408 Md. at 505, 970 A.2d at 902 (quoting <em>State v. Williams, </em>401 Md. 676, 678, 934 A.2d 38, 40 (2007)); <em>Longshore, </em>399 Md. at 499, 924 A.2d at 1136. Thus, this Court considers the evidence adduced at the suppression hearing, construed in the light most favorable to the State as the prevailing party at the suppression hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>III.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-5\">The Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution guarantees \u201c[t]he right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated.... \u201d When the police obtain evidence through a search or seizure that violates the Fourth Amendment, \u201cexclusion of evidence obtained in violation of these provisions is an essential part of the Fourth Amendment protections.\u201d <em>Swift v. State, </em>393 Md. 139, 149, 899 A.2d 867, 873 (2006) (citing <em>Mapp v. Ohio, </em>367 U.S. 643, 655-56, 81 S.Ct. 1684, 1691, 6 L.Ed.2d 1081 (1961); <em>State v. Lee, </em>374 Md. 275, 297-98, 821 A.2d 922, 934-35 (2003)). The Fourth Amendment, however, is \u201cnot implicated in every situation where the police have contact with an individual.\u201d <em>Swift, </em>393 Md. at 149, 899 A.2d at 873 (citing <em>California v. Hodari D., </em>499 U.S. 621, 625-26, 111 S.Ct. 1547, 1550-51, 113 L.Ed.2d 690 (1991); <em>Scott v. State, </em>366 Md. 121, 133, 782 A.2d 862, 869 (2001)). This Court analyzed the applicability of the Fourth Amendment to varying levels of police interaction in <em>Swift, </em>393 Md. at 149-51, 899 A.2d at 873-74:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-6\">Many courts have analyzed the applicability of the Fourth Amendment in terms of three tiers of interaction between a citizen and the police. The most intrusive encounter, an arrest, requires probable cause to believe that a person has committed or is committing a crime. The second category, the investigatory stop or detention, known commonly as a <em>Tenry </em>stop, is less intrusive than a formal custodial arrest and must be supported by reasonable suspicion that a person has committed or is about to commit a crime and permits an officer to stop and briefly detain an individual.... The least intrusive police-citizen contact, a consensual encounter, ... involves no restraint of liberty and elicits an individual\u2019s voluntary cooperation with non-coercive police contact. A consensual encounter need not be supported by any suspicion and because an individual is free to leave at any time during such an encounter, the Fourth Amendment is not implicated; thus, an individual is not considered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>to have been \u2018seized\u2019 within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b392-5\"><em>Id. </em>(internal citations omitted). We will consider how the petitioner\u2019s encounter with Officer Lewis proceeded from consensual encounter to custodial arrest, in light of settled Fourth Amendment precedent. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b392-6\">IV. Consensual Encounter or Investigatory Stop</p>\n<p id=\"b392-7\">We agree with the intermediate appellate court that Officer Lewis\u2019s initial questioning of the petitioner was not an investigative stop, but rather a \u201cconsensual encounter\u201d or accosting. As <em>Swift, </em>393 Md. at 151, 899 A.2d at 874, instructs us, a consensual encounter does not implicate the Fourth Amendment because the individual with whom the police are interacting is free to leave at any time. The Court of Special Appeals analyzed the petitioner\u2019s encounter with Officer Lewis as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-8\">When the police officers asked [the petitioner] if he lived at the house in whose shadows he was standing, [the petitioner] could not have reasonably believed that the police were doing anything more than making a routine inquiry. The officers\u2019 inquiry was a request for basic information, not an order. Officer Lewis \u201cyelled\u201d the question because of the distance between the officers and [the petitioner], and the officers began to walk toward [the petitioner] only after he did not respond to their questions, presumably to find out why he had not.... In sum, [the petitioner] was not seized by the officers but merely was accosted at the point at which the officers began to approach him.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b392-9\">Thus, this Court need not consider whether Officer Lewis had reasonable articulable suspicion of criminal activity when he decided to approach the petitioner after the petitioner twice failed to respond to his question. There was no investigative stop of the petitioner under <em>Terry v. Ohio, </em>392 U.S. 1, 88 S.Ct. 1868, 20 L.Ed.2d 889 (1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b393-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>V. Seizure and Search</p>\n<p id=\"b393-4\">\u201cAn encounter has been described as a fluid situation, and one which begins as a consensual encounter may lose its consensual nature and become an investigatory detention or arrest once a person\u2019s liberty has been restrained and the person would not be free to leave.\u201d <em>Swift, </em>393 Md. at 152, 899 A.2d at 874-75. Officer Lewis\u2019s testimony indicates that his encounter with the petitioner proceeded quickly from an accosting, in which he shouted questions to the petitioner from the street, to a physical detention, when he grabbed the petitioner\u2019s hands.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-5\">As the Supreme Court observed in <em>Terry, </em>392 U.S. at 19 n. 16, 88 S.Ct. at 1879 n. 16, \u201c[w]hen the officer, by means of physical force or a show of authority, has in some way restrained the liberty of a citizen [we may] conclude that a \u2018seizure\u2019 has occurred.\u201d In determining whether a person has been seized, \u201cthe crucial test is whether, taking into account all of the circumstances surrounding the encounter, the police conduct would \u2018have communicated to a reasonable person that he was not at liberty to ignore the police presence and go about his business.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b393-6\"><em>Swift, </em>393 Md. at 152-53, 899 A.2d at 875 (quoting <em>Florida v. Bostick, </em>501 U.S. 429, 437, 111 S.Ct. 2382, 2387, 115 L.Ed.2d 389 (1991) (quoting <em>Michigan v. Chesternut, </em>486 U.S. 567, 569, 108 S.Ct. 1975, 1977, 100 L.Ed.2d 565 (1988))). The inquiry is fact-specific and based on the perception of a reasonable person under the totality of the circumstances. <em>E.g., Bostick, </em>501 U.S. at 439, 111 S.Ct. at 2389, 115 L.Ed.2d at 401-02 (\u201cWe adhere to the rule that, in order to determine whether a particular encounter constitutes a seizure, a court must consider all circumstances surrounding the encounter.... \u201d). This Court identified factors that are probative of whether a reasonable person would feel free to leave in <em>Ferris v. State, </em>355 Md. 356, 377, 735 A.2d 491, 502 (1999), including</p>\n<blockquote id=\"At9\">the time and place of the encounter, the number of officers present and whether they were uniformed, whether the police removed the person to a different location or isolated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>him or her from others, whether the person was informed that he or she was free to leave, whether the police indicated that the person was suspected of a crime, whether the police retained the person\u2019s documents, and whether the police exhibited threatening behavior or physical contact that would suggest to a reasonable person that he or she was not free to leave.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b394-5\">In the present case, it is clear that, once Officer Lewis grabbed the petitioner\u2019s hands and placed them over his head, a reasonable person in the petitioner\u2019s position would have understood that he was physically detained and thus not free to leave or go about his business. Thus, when Officer Lewis grabbed the petitioner\u2019s hands, he seized the petitioner for purposes of the Fourth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-6\">Because the officer seized and searched the petitioner without a warrant, the seizure was presumptively invalid unless it was supported by a reasonable, articulable suspicion of a threat to officer safety or by an exception to the warrant requirement. <em>Belote v. State, </em>411 Md. 104, 112, 981 A.2d 1247, 1252 (2009); <em>Wilson v. State, </em>409 Md. 415, 439, 975 A.2d 877, 892 (2009). \u201cIt is well established that the State has the burden of proving the legality of a warrantless search and seizure.\u201d <em>Paulino v. State, </em>399 Md. 341, 348, 924 A.2d 308, 312 (2007) (citing <em>Sifrit v. State, </em>383 Md. 77, 114, 857 A.2d 65, 86 (2004); <em>State v. Bell, </em>334 Md. 178, 191, 638 A.2d 107, 114 (1994); <em>Stackhouse v. State, </em>298 Md. 203, 217, 468 A.2d 333, 341 (1983)). We must consider whether this seizure of the petitioner was a temporary detention and protective frisk pursuant to <em>Terry, </em>as the Circuit Court found, or a lawful arrest of the petitioner, as the Court of Special Appeals held.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-7\">VI. <em>Terry </em>Frisk</p>\n<p id=\"b394-8\">We disagree with the Circuit Court\u2019s conclusion that the search and seizure of the petitioner was an investigatory stop and protective frisk pursuant to <em>Terry</em><footnotemark><em>5</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The pur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>pose of a protective <em>Terry </em>frisk is \u201cnot to discover evidence, but rather to protect the police officer and bystanders from harm.\u201d <em>Longshore, </em>399 Md. at 508, 924 A.2d at 1141 (quoting <em>State v. Smith, </em>345 Md. 460, 465, 693 A.2d 749, 751 (1997)). Pat-down frisks are proper when the officer \u201chas reason to believe that he is dealing with an armed and dangerous individual, regardless of whether he has probable cause to arrest the individual for a crime.\u201d <em>Longshore, </em>399 Md. at 508-09, 924 A.2d at 1141 (quoting <em>Terry, </em>392 U.S. at 27, 88 S.Ct. at 1883, 20 L.Ed.2d at 909). The officer has reason to believe that an individual is armed and dangerous if a reasonably prudent person, under the circumstances, would have felt that he was in danger, based on reasonable inferences from particularized facts in light of the officer\u2019s experience. <em>Longshore, </em>399 Md. at 509, 924 A.2d at 1141-42.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-5\">Even if we were to assume that the encounter with the Officer Lewis was a <em>Terry </em>stop, \u201c[t]he reasonableness of a <em>Terry </em>stop is determined by considering \u2018[wjhether the officer\u2019s action was justified at its inception, and whether it was reasonably related in scope to the circumstances which justified the interference in the first place.\u2019 \u201d <em>Longshore, </em>399 Md. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>at 506, 924 A.2d at 1140 (quoting <em>Terry, </em>392 U.S. at 20, 88 S.Ct. at 1879, 20 L.Ed.2d at 905). Further, assuming <em>arguendo </em>that Officer Lewis had reasonable, articulable suspicion to believe that criminal activity was afoot and, accordingly, detain the petitioner, he still lacked the basis for a protective <em>Terry </em>frisk. At the suppression hearing, Officer Lewis indicated that he searched the petitioner to \u201c[c]heck for weapons,\u201d but did not provide any basis for his suspicion that the petitioner was armed and dangerous. Officer Lewis did not testify as to any factors that would lead to a suspicion that the petitioner was carrying a weapon. Further, there are no objective factors in the record that indicate that the petitioner was armed and dangerous. Although the encounter took place at nighttime, the petitioner was alone and the officer \u201ccould visibly see his hands,\u201d which, presumably because the officer did not indicate otherwise, were empty. There is no indication in the record that the petitioner made any threatening movements, or any movements at all, nor is there any indication that Officer Lewis suspected that the petitioner was dealing drugs. Thus, we concur with the Court of Special Appeals, and hold that Officer Lewis had no basis to conduct a protective frisk.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b396-5\">Even if Officer Lewis had reasonably believed that the petitioner was armed and dangerous, therefore providing the basis for a proper <em>Terry </em>frisk, the search in the present case exceeded the scope of a proper protective frisk. A proper <em>Terry </em>frisk is limited to a pat-down of the outer clothing \u201cnot to discover evidence of a crime, but rather to protect the police officer and bystanders from harm\u201d by checking for weapons. <em>In re David S., </em>367 Md. 523, 544, 789 A.2d 607, 619 (2002).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>If during a lawful pat-down an officer feels an object which obviously is not a weapon, further patting of it is not permissible. The Supreme Court has made it clear that \u201cif the protective search goes beyond what is necessary to determine if the suspect is armed, it is no longer valid under <em>Terry </em>and its fruits will be suppressed.\u201d On the other hand, \u201c[i]f a police officer lawfully pats down a suspect\u2019s outer clothing and feels an object whose contour or mass makes its identity <em>immediately apparent, </em>there has been no invasion of the suspect\u2019s privacy beyond that already authorized by the officer\u2019s search for weapons.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b397-5\"><em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Minnesota v. Dickerson, </em>508 U.S. 366, 373, 375, 113 S.Ct. 2130, 2136-37, 124 L.Ed.2d 334 (1993)) (internal citations omitted) (emphasis added). Generally, \u201ca pat down is ... a proper, minimally intrusive means of determining whether a suspect is armed.\u201d <em>State v. Smith, </em>345 Md. at 465-66, 693 A.2d at 751.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-6\">The officer may not exceed the limited scope of a patdown for weapons to search for contraband. \u201cGeneral exploratory searches are not permitted [pursuant to <em>Terry], </em>and police officers must distinguish between the need to protect themselves and the desire to uncover incriminating evidence.\u201d <em>In re David S., </em>367 Md. at 545, 789 A.2d at 619 (quoting <em>State v. Smith, </em>345 Md. at 465, 693 A.2d at 751) (holding that the officer exceeded the permissible scope of a <em>Terry </em>frisk when he opened a bag found in the individual\u2019s waistband after realizing the bag did not contain a weapon). If the pat-down uncovered an object that is not a weapon and \u201cthe incriminating character of the object was not immediately apparent ... [but] [rlather, the officer determined that the item was contraband only after conducting a further search,\u201d then the further search exceeded the permissible scope of <em>Terry. Smith, </em>345 Md. at 470, 693 A.2d at 754 (quoting <em>Dickerson, </em>508 U.S. at 379, 113 S.Ct. at 2139, 124 L.Ed.2d at 347-48 (citation omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b397-7\">In the present case, Officer Lewis testified that he patted down the petitioner\u2019s right front pocket and that he did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>manipulate the object contained therein. Officer Lewis testified that he \u201cfelt and recognized a glass vial in [the petitioner\u2019s] pocket.\u201d He further testified that generally, in his experience, PCP is \u201c[contained in a glass vial.\u201d\u2019 Based on Officer Lewis\u2019s testimony, however, the incriminating nature of the object in the defendant\u2019s pocket was not immediately apparent upon his initial touch of the object in the pat-down. Rather, Officer Lewis testified that he field-tested the liquid contained in the vial after removing it from the petitioner\u2019s pocket, thereby determining that the liquid contained PCP. The removal of the vial from the petitioner\u2019s pocket and field test of the liquid contained in the vial constituted a general exploratory search exceeding the permissible scope of a protective <em>Terry </em>frisk. Accordingly, we hold that Officer Lewis lacked the proper basis for a <em>Terry </em>frisk at the inception of the search, and that the search was a general exploratory search that exceeded the permissible scope of a <em>Terry </em>frisk, which serves as a basis to exclude the evidence seized from the petitioner\u2019s pocket.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-5\">VII. Arrest</p>\n<p id=\"b398-6\">We must consider, alternatively, whether Officer Lewis\u2019s seizure of the petitioner in the present case constituted a de facto arrest, as the Court of Special Appeals determined.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> This Court analyzed what constitutes an arrest in <em>Bouldin v. State, </em>276 Md. 511, 515-16, 350 A.2d- 130, 133 (1976).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b398-7\">It is generally recognized that an arrest is the taking, seizing, or detaining of the person of another ... by touching or putting hands on him____ It is said that four elements must ordinarily coalesce to constitute a legal arrest: (1) an intent to arrest; (2) under a real or pretended authority; (3) accompanied by a seizure or detention of the person; and (4) which is understood by the person arrested.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b399-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>In <em>Balote v. State, </em>411 Md. at 117, 981 A.2d at 1254, this Court further analyzed the factors set forth in <em>Bouldin:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b399-5\">[W]here a police officer\u2019s objective conduct unambiguously reflects an intent to make a custodial arrest, the subjective intent inquiry ... takes on less significance. In other words, when an arresting officer\u2019s objective conduct, which provides significant insight into the officer\u2019s subjective intent, is unambiguous, courts need not allocate significant weight to an officer\u2019s subjective intent that is revealed partially in the form of his testimony at the suppression hearing; the officer\u2019s objective conduct, in effect, will have made his subjective intent clear.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b399-6\">A show of force is objective conduct demonstrating the officer\u2019s intent to make an arrest. \u201c[Generally, a display of force by a police officer, such as putting a person in handcuffs, is considered an arrest.\u201d <em>Longshore, </em>399 Md. at 502, 924 A.2d at 1138. In <em>California v. Hodari D., </em>499 U.S. at 626, 111 S.Ct. at 1550, 113 L.Ed.2d. at 697, the Supreme Court of the United States held that \u201c[a]n arrest requires ... physical force\u201d by \u201claying on of hands or application of physical force to restrain movement.\u201d Although the display of force often involves placing the individual who is seized in handcuffs, application of handcuffs is not a necessary element of an arrest. <em>See Grier v. State, </em>351 Md. 241, 252, 718 A.2d 211, 217 (1998) (\u201cOnce Petitioner was on the ground and in custody and control of the officers, he was certainly under arrest.

New York, </em>442 U.S. 200, 207-08, 99 S.Ct. 2248, 2254, 60 L.Ed.2d 824 (1979)).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> If a seizure and subse<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>quent search is not justified by reasonable, articulable suspicion that the individual is armed pursuant to <em>Terry, </em>the seizure is a de facto arrest and must be supported by probable cause in order to be lawful.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-5\">In this case, Officer Lewis\u2019s conduct constituted an unambiguous show of force. He approached the petitioner while in uniform, physically restrained the petitioner, conducted a search of the petitioner\u2019s person, and ultimately took the petitioner into physical police custody. <em>Belote, </em>411 Md. at 117, 981 A.2d at 1254, instructs us that, although Officer Lewis testified at the suppression hearing that he was checking the petitioner for weapons, this statement is given less weight than his objective conduct on the night in question.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Officer Lewis\u2019s conduct demonstrates that he intended to take the petitioner into physical custody, he acted with actual authority and physically seized the petitioner, and the petitioner had a clear understanding that he was not free to leave.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-6\">Although Officer Lewis describes his encounter with the petitioner as a \u201cpat-down\u201d to \u201ccheck ... around the waistband where you\u2019re able to conceal ... weapons,\u201d the totality of the circumstances show that the encounter constituted a de facto arrest, albeit described as a <em>Terry </em>stop. Officer Lewis\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>conduct on the night in question exceeded the permissible boundaries of an investigative <em>Terry </em>stop, both in scope and in duration. A <em>Terry </em>stop must be justified both at its inception and be limited in scope, for the specific purpose of searching for weapons to protect the officer\u2019s safety, or the safety of bystanders. In the present case, the officer took complete control of the situation in conducting a general exploratory search of the petitioner, removing the vial from his pocket and taking him into custody. As discussed <em>infra, </em>the officer had no objective reason to suspect that the petitioner was armed and dangerous, nor did the officer\u2019s testimony furnish a basis for a suspicion that the petitioner was armed. Further, the search itself exceeded the scope of a valid <em>Terry </em>frisk. The search undertaken in the present case was only valid if it was undertaken within the context of an arrest, which must be supported by probable cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-5\">Grabbing the petitioner\u2019s wrists when he was not suspected of being armed and dangerous, then conducting a search and removing the vial from his pocket, and, finally, taking him into custody as the initial action leading up to a criminal prosecution, constituted a de facto arrest. Thus, we hold that Officer Lewis\u2019s seizure, in which he physically restrained the petitioner and ultimately took him into custody, constituted an arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-6\">VIII. Probable Cause Supporting a Warrantless Arrest</p>\n<p id=\"Agg\">We must now consider whether Officer Lewis\u2019s arrest of the petitioner was lawful. <em>\u201cA </em>warrantless arrest of an individual in a public place for a felony, or a misdemeanor committed in the officer\u2019s presence, is consistent with the Fourth Amendment if the arrest is supported by probable cause.\u201d <em>Longshore, </em>399 Md. at 501, 924 A.2d at 1137 (citing <em>United States v.

A finding of probable cause requires less evidence than is necessary to sustain a conviction, but more evidence than <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>would merely arouse suspicion. Our determination of whether probable cause exists requires a nontechnical, common sense evaluation of the totality of the circumstances in a given situation in light of the facts found to be credible by the trial judge.... Therefore, to justify a warrantless arrest the police must point to specific and articulable facts which, taken together with rational inferences from those facts, reasonably warranted the intrusion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b403-5\"><em>State v. Wallace, </em>372 Md. 137, 148, 812 A.2d 291, 297-98 (2002) (quoting <em>Collins v. State, </em>322 Md. 675, 680, 589 A.2d 479, 481 (1991)) (internal citations omitted); <em>Illinois v. Gates, </em>462 U.S. 213, 230-32, 103 S.Ct. 2317, 2328-29, 76 L.Ed.2d 527, 543-45 (1983). In the case of a search incident to arrest, the State must show that probable cause supported a lawful arrest before the officer conducted the search. <em>Bouldin, </em>276 Md. at 515, 350 A.2d at 132; <em>see also Davids v. State, </em>208 Md. 377, 385, 118 A.2d 636, 639 (1955) (evidence seized following the arrest cannot be taken into consideration in determining whether the officer had probable cause to make the arrest). We shall consider only what the officer articulated as the basis for the seizure: the smell of ether emanated from the petitioner\u2019s person, the petitioner was standing next to a house in a high drug crime area, and the petitioner did not respond to Officer Lewis\u2019s questions.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> We hold that, based on what Officer Lewis knew at the moment that he seized the petitioner, he did not have probable cause to believe that the petitioner had committed or was committing a crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-6\">The petitioner argues that, considering the totality of the circumstances, the facts do not constitute probable cause to show that he was committing a crime on the night in question. Although the intermediate appellate court held that \u201cknowl<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>edge gained from the sense of smell alone may be of such character as to give rise to probable cause for a belief that a crime is being committed\u201d in <em>Ford v. State, </em>37 Md.App. 373, 379, 377 A.2d 577, 580 (1977) (applying <em>Johnson v. United States, </em>333 U.S. 10, 68 S.Ct. 367, 92 L.Ed. 436 (1948)), the substance in question in <em>Ford, </em>marijuana, was contraband and had a distinctive identifying odor. In the present case, the substance in question, ether, is not contraband. Possession of ether is not a criminal act, nor did the surrounding circumstances provide a substantial basis for a suspicion that the petitioner possessed contraband. The petitioner also examines cases from a variety of jurisdictions that directly addressed the odor of ether or PCP as part of a probable cause analysis. The petitioner distinguishes the cases involving the odor of ether or other lawful substances on the basis that, in those cases, the odor of ether was accompanied by factors strongly suggesting the presence of contraband. Unlike in those cases, there are no significant corroborating factors here.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-5\">The State argues that several courts in other jurisdictions have found that the smell of ether alone is sufficient to establish probable cause. The State maintains that, even if this were not the case, the other factors present, such as standing in the shadows in a known drug area and characteristics consistent with PCP intoxication, provide an additional basis for establishing probable cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-6\">It is well-established that odor is a valid consideration in the probable cause analysis. <em>United States v. Ventresca, </em>380 U.S. 102, 111, 85 S.Ct. 741, 747, 13 L.Ed.2d 684, 690 (1965) (observation of 601b bags of sugar, empty tin cans, and odor of mash whisky provided sufficient probable cause for a search warrant); <em>Ford, </em>37 Md.App. at 379, 377 A.2d at 580 (\u201c[K]nowledge gained from the sense of smell alone may be of such character as to give rise to probable cause for a belief that a crime is being committed in the presence of the officer.\u201d) Maryland courts have previously held that the odor of contraband alone is sufficient to establish probable cause for a belief <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>that contraband is present. <em>Ford, 37 </em>Md.App. at 379, 377 A.2d at 580; <em>see also Waugh v.

Maryland courts, however, have not held that the odor of a lawful substance that is allegedly associated with contraband constitutes probable cause for a belief that contraband is present.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-4\">The Supreme Court of Kansas recently addressed the issue of whether the odor of ether constitutes probable cause for a warrantless search of a vehicle in <em>State v. Ibarra, </em>282 Kan. 530, 147 P.3d 842 (2006). During a routine traffic stop, the officer smelled a strong odor of ether emanating from the vehicle. <em>Ibarra, </em>147 P.3d at 844-45. Based on the odor of ether, the officer searched the vehicle. <em>Ibarra, </em>147 P.3d at 845. The search uncovered at black bag containing a glass container of white powder. <em>Id. </em>Meld tests confirmed that the powder was methamphetamine. <em>Id. </em>In considering whether the officer had probable cause to search Ibarra\u2019s vehicle based on the smell of ether, the Supreme Court of Kansas noted that the odor of contraband, including marijuana and alcohol, can constitute probable cause to support a warrantless search. <em>Ibarra, </em>147 P.3d at 847-48 (citing <em>State v. MacDonald, </em>253 Kan. 320, 856 P.2d 116, 120 (1993) (odor of marijuana constitutes probable cause to support a warrantless search); <em>State v. Bickerstaff, </em>26 Kan.App.2d 423, 988 P.2d 285, 286 (1999) (odor of alcohol, breath test, and denial of drinking constitute probable cause for warrantless search of a vehicle)). After determining that the exigent circumstances exception to the warrant clause did not apply, <em>Ibarra, </em>147 P.3d at 849, the Court distinguished the odor of ether from the odor of marijuana or other contraband.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b405-5\">[T]he odor of marijuana, an illegal substance, can provide probable cause standing alone.... It is not surprising then that the odor of marijuana combined with an anonymous tip can furnish probable cause. In the present ease, the ether smelled by the officers is not an illegal substance and we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>decline to conclude that the odor of ether alone could establish probable cause for the search of Ibarra\u2019s vehicle. Where the odor alone does not furnish probable cause, this court .should not use it to bootstrap insubstantial information in. to establish probable cause.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b406-5\"><em>Ibarra, </em>147 P.3d at 856. The odor of ether is distinguishable from the odor of contraband like marijuana because \u201c[t]he strong odor of ether ... is as consistent with lawful activity as it is with criminal activity.\u201d <em>Ibarra, </em>147 P.3d at 850. Thus, \u201cthe smell of ether alone is justification for further investigation but not for a search.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b406-6\">We disagree with the State\u2019s interpretation of the cases it cites in support of the proposition that' the odor of ether alone is sufficient to establish probable cause. The State cites <em>United States v. Clayton, </em>210 F.3d 841, 842 (8th Cir.2000), in which police, acting on an anonymous tip about a methamphetamine laboratory and illegal guns, went to Clayton\u2019s home to execute an arrest warrant on an unrelated matter. Upon arriving at the home, the officers smelled odors related to the manufacture of methamphetamine and saw jars of liquid that the officers believed to be methamphetamine. <em>Clayton, </em>210 F.3d at 842-43. Although the officers had no search warrant, Clayton consented to the search. <em>Clayton, </em>210 F.3d at 843. The Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit upheld the validity of the search, holding that the officers validly entered Clayton\u2019s home to execute an unrelated arrest warrant, and that the odor and other items were in \u201cplain view\u201d upon entry. <em>Clayton, </em>210 F.3d at 844-45. In that case, the police relied not only on the odor of chemicals associated with methamphetamine manufacture in seeking a search warrant, but also the corroborating tip about methamphetamine manufacture and the presence of liquids that appeared to be methamphetamine.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-7\">Similarly, in <em>State v. Kennedy, </em>953 So.2d 655, 656 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App.2007), police received information that Kennedy was involved in a feud over stolen anhydrous ammonia to be used in the manufacture of methamphetamine. Acting on this information, police went to Kennedy\u2019s home to investigate the possibility of methamphetamine manufacture. <em>Id. </em>From out<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>side the home, police smelled the odors of anhydrous ammonia and ether, which the officer \u201cknew were consistent with the manufacture of methamphetamine. Based on these odors, the task force leader arrested [Kennedy] as soon as [Kennedy] opened the front door.\u201d <em>Id. </em>On a subsequent \u201cprotective sweep\u201d of the home, officers found a methamphetamine laboratory. <em>Id. </em>The Court of Appeals of Florida, First District, reversed the lower court\u2019s decision to suppress the evidence recovered from the home, noting that \u201c[w]hen the lead officer smelled the odors of anhydrous ammonia and ether, which he knew were consistent with the manufacture of methamphetamine, probable cause existed to arrest [Kennedy].\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> <em>Kennedy, 953 </em>So.2d at <em>657. </em>Not unlike <em>Clayton, </em>210 F.3d at 844-45, <em>Kennedy </em>is distinguishable from the present facts because the corroborating tip about methamphetamine manufacturing in the home provided a context that supported the officer\u2019s belief that the odor of lawful substances was associated with criminal activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-5\">The State also relies on <em>Minnick v. United States, </em>607 A.2d 519 (D.C.1992). In <em>Minnick, </em>police officers stopped Minnick\u2019s car for a traffic violation in an area known for PCP trafficking. <em>Minnick, </em>607 A.2d at 521. During the stop, the officers \u201csmelled a strong odor of PCP emanating from inside the car.\u201d <em>Id. A </em>search of Minnick\u2019s purse uncovered two vials of PCP. <em>Id. </em>The District of Columbia Court of Appeals held that \u201cthe search ... was justified by the strong, distinctive odor of PCP which both detectives smelled as they approached Minnick\u2019s car,\u201d and accordingly held that the search did not violate the Fourth Amendment. <em>Minnick, </em>607 A.2d at 525. Unlike marijuana, which has a readily identifiable, distinctive odor, it is unclear from the case law or the record in the present case <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>whether PCP has its own distinctive odor when it is transported or consumed, or whether the odor is that of other substances allegedly associated with the drug, such as ether. We cannot determine whether the odor discussed in <em>Minnick </em>is the same odor of ether that Officer Lewis detected when he encountered the petitioner. The court\u2019s conclusion in <em>Min-nick, </em>however, was not only supported by the odor of PCP, but also on the officer\u2019s knowledge that the area in question was specifically known for PCP trafficking.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Moreover, the record in the present case is barren of information about the qualities of PCP odors. There is no information in the record indicating whether the odor of PCP may have different qualities, similar to the distinction between the odor of burning marijuana and raw marijuana. <em>See Wilson v. State, </em>174 Md.App. 434, 454-55, 921 A.2d 881, 892 (2007) (discussing the distinction between raw and burnt marijuana odors in a probable cause analysis).</p>\n<p id=\"b409-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>We are unaware of any cases in which a court held that the smell of ether or another lawful substance associated with contraband, on its own, constituted probable cause for a belief that contraband was present or a crime was committed.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> To the contrary, several courts have take the same position as the Supreme Court of Kansas in <em>Ibarra, </em>282 Kan. 530, 147 P.3d 842, discussed <em>supra, </em>holding that the odor of a lawful substance, on its own, does not constitute probable cause for a belief that contraband is present or a crime has been committed, even if the lawful substance is allegedly associated with contraband. <em>United States v. Matteucci, </em>842 F.Supp. 442, 447 (D.Or.1994) (holding that smell of items used in methamphetamine manufacture does not constitute probable cause on its own for a warrantless search under the automobile exception); <em>People v. Dickson, </em>144 Cal.App.3d 1046, 192 Cal.Rptr. 897, 903-04 (1983) (holding that the odor of ether, one of many chemical ingredients required in the manufacture of methamphetamine, will not constitute probable cause for a warrantless entry); <em>Ibarra, </em>147 P.3d at 850 (holding that the strong odor of ether alone, even without an explanation, does not constitute probable cause for a warrantless vehicle search because the \u201codor of ether is as consistent with lawful activity as it is with criminal activity\u201d); <em>cf. State v. Mahsman, </em>157 S.W.3d 245, 253 (Mo.App.2004) (holding that \u201codd behavior while in lawful possession of guns and ether does not, without more, suggest drug use or provide probable cause to support a search warrant for drugs\u201d); <em>see also United States v. Tate, </em>694 F.2d 1217, 1224 (9th Cir.1982), <em>vacated, </em>468 U.S. 1206, 104 S.Ct. 3575, 82 L.Ed.2d 873 (1984) (\u201csmell of a non-contraband <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>substance having a number of legitimate uses, standing alone, does not establish probable cause to search a' residence\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b410-5\">As this Court recently noted in <em>Crosby, </em>408 Md. at 512, 970 A.2d at 907, \u201cit is \u2018impossible for wholly innocent factors to combine into a suspicious conglomeration unless there are concrete reasons for such an interpretation.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>United States v. Wood, </em>106 F.3d 942, 948 (10th Cir.1997) (internal citations omitted)). The odor of ether is an innocent factor without context, but the totality of the circumstances may lead to a conclusion that the lawful substance is associated with a criminal purpose. <em>See Crosby, </em>408 Md. at 508, 970 A.2d at 904 (\u201c[C]ontext matters: actions that may appear innocuous at a certain time or in a certain place might very well serve as a harbinger of criminal activity under different circumstances.\u201d (quoting <em>United States v. Branch, </em>537 F.3d 328, 336 (4th Cir.2008))). In the cases in which courts held that the odor of ether or another lawful substance constituted probable cause for a belief that contraband or criminal activity were present, the surrounding circumstances strongly suggested that the odor was associated with criminal activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-6\">In the cases discussed <em>infra, </em>courts have held that the odor of ether or other non-contraband substances constituted probable cause when the suspicion of criminal activity was corroborated by other circumstantial evidence of criminal activity, such as a tip providing specific information about drug manufacture, or specific knowledge that an area is known for the distribution of the contraband associated with the odor. <em>See Clayton, </em>210 F.3d at 844-45 (odor of ether, tip about methamphetamine manufacture); <em>Minnick, </em>607 A.2d at 524-25 (odor of PCP, area known for PCP distribution); <em>Kennedy, </em>953 So.2d at 656-57 (odor of ether and ammonia, tip about methamphetamine manufacture). Other courts have relied on similar factors in determining that the odor of ether, combined with other factors, constituted probable cause. <em>See Fouse v. State, </em>73 Ark. App. 134, 43 S.W.3d 158, 166 (2001) (odor of ether, informant information, counter-surveillance measures <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>taken while home was under surveillance). The other factors cited by courts include the presence of drug paraphernalia, the presence of other items used in the manufacture of contraband, and suspicious statements of the suspects. <em>See State v. Nitcher, </em>720 N.W.2d 547, 555 (Iowa 2006) (odor of ether, shuffling inside a garage, suspect denied an obvious chemical odor); <em>State v. Ulrey, </em>41 Kan.App.2d 1052, 208 P.3d 317, 324 (2009) (jug, box of salt, and kitchen strainer, all items used in the manufacture of methamphetamine, combined with odor of anhydrous ammonia); <em>Hollis v. State, </em>219 S.W.3d 446, 460 (Tex.App.2007) (odor of ether emanating from abandoned building, scale, tubing, drug paraphernalia, jars of liquid, white powder). In all of the aforementioned cases, the surrounding circumstances provided other factors, in addition to the odor of ether, that led to a reasonable conclusion that the defendant was involved in criminal activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-5\">In the present case, the totality of the circumstances do not provide a concrete reason to associate the odor of ether with criminal activity or contraband. In reaching its decision that Officer Lewis had reasonable articulable suspicion to approach the petitioner, a lesser standard than probable cause, the Circuit Court relied on the odor of ether, the fact that the petitioner was in a high drug crime area and standing \u201cwell in the shadows,\u201d and the petitioner\u2019s failure to respond to Officer Lewis\u2019s questions. The Circuit Court did not rely on the petitioner\u2019s glossy eyes, nor did the court make a factual finding as to whether Officer Lewis observed the petitioner\u2019s eyes before he seized the petitioner. Moreover, Officer Lewis\u2019s testimony did not indicate whether he observed the petitioner\u2019s glossy eyes before or after initially seizing the petitioner. Further, Officer Lewis did not elaborate on the definition of \u201cglossy\u201d or how glossiness would tend to show intoxication. Thus, we shall not consider the petitioner\u2019s allegedly glossy eyes in our probable cause analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-6\">The Circuit Court gave \u201cgreat weight\u201d to the fact that the petitioner was standing in a high drug crime area, where the police had received \u201ca number of complaints from citizens.\u201d Certainly, the fact that activity is taking place in a high drug <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>crime area can inform the police officer\u2019s analysis about the nature of activity taking place. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Arvizu, </em>534 U.S. 266, 274, 122 S.Ct. 744, 751, 151 L.Ed.2d 740, 750 (2002) (conduct that might be innocent in its own way may be suspicious under other circumstances). In the present case, however, the petitioner\u2019s presence in a high drug crime area does not provide a suspicious context for his otherwise innocuous actions, mainly because the petitioner was not engaged in any particular activity. According to Officer Lewis\u2019s testimony, the petitioner was not crouching behind anything, standing behind an object, or peering through windows, he was merely standing along the side of a house next to a parking lot. Further, there is no indication that the petitioner was engaging in any behavior that would suggest that he was ingesting PCP, such as smoking what appeared to be a cigarette or attempting to extinguish or hide a smoking device. Additionally, the testimony about the high drug crime area did not provide any specific information that would support a conclusion that the petitioner was involved in criminal activity. Unlike in <em>Minnick, </em>607 A.2d at 520, where the area in question was known for PCP trafficking, in the present case there were no specific complaints about PCP, the petitioner, or about drug activity in the area on the night in question. Rather, the testimony indicated that there were general complaints about criminal or drug activity in the area, of unknown frequency, made at unknown points in time. We are mindful of this Court\u2019s warning in <em>Ransome v. State, </em>373 Md. 99, 111, 816 A.2d 901, 908 (2003):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-5\">If the police can stop and frisk any man found on the street at night in a high-crime area merely because he has a bulge in his pocket, stops to look at an unmarked car containing three ununiformed men, and then, when those men alight suddenly from the car and approach the citizen, acts nervously, there would, indeed, be little Fourth Amendment protection left for those men who live in or have occasion to visit high-crime areas.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b412-6\"><em>Id. </em>(holding that there was no reasonable basis for a frisk because \u201cpetitioner had done nothing to attract police atten<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>tion other than being on the street with a bulge in his pocket\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b413-4\">We are equally hesitant to determine that the petitioner\u2019s failure to answer Officer Lewis\u2019s questions has any significance, in a probable cause determination, in the absence of further facts suggesting a suspicious or criminal element to his silence. Officer Lewis testified that he interpreted the defendant\u2019s silence as evidence of intoxication:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b413-5\">Q [State\u2019s Attorney]: ... What are some of the general characteristics of an individual under the influence of phencyclidine?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b413-6\">A [Officer Lewis]: Normally, they possess various strengths, <em>sometimes they could be incoherent in reference to trying to understand if someone is saying something to them....</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b413-8\">Q: Other than the defendant having glassy eyes, are there any other characteristics that the defendant had on the night that you came into contact with him that would be reminiscent of someone under the influence of phencyclidine?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b413-9\">A: No response once I was asking him questions.... When I asked the defendant a question, I got <em>no </em>response from him.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b413-10\">(Emphasis added.) Although Officer Lewis does not say so directly, the inference appears to be that when the petitioner did not answer the question twice posed to him, his failure to respond was due to incoherence or an inability to comprehend the question due to intoxication. The Circuit Court did not make a factual finding about whether the court interpreted the petitioner\u2019s silence as evidence of intoxication. Rather, the court noted that the petitioner\u2019s failure to respond \u201c[gave] Officer Lewis reason to approach the defendant and the right to determine the individual\u2019s name and address.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b413-11\">Although the State is entitled to the benefit of any reasonable inferences from the evidence adduced at the suppression hearing, in our view, it is not reasonable to infer that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>petitioner\u2019s silence suggested intoxication. \u201cIn a probable cause determination, \u2018the experience and special knowledge of the police officers who are [attempting to establish probable cause] are among the facts which may be considered.\u2019 The observations of the police, however, must be based on something factual.\u201d <em>Longshore, </em>399 Md. at 534, 924 A.2d at 1157 (quoting <em>Wood v.

Here, no facts were presented to distinguish the petitioner\u2019s supposedly intoxication-based silence from a decision by the petitioner to invoke his Constitutional right to ignore Officer Lewis\u2019s questions. <em>See Terry v. Ohio, </em>392 U.S. at 34, 88 S.Ct. at 1886, 20 L.Ed.2d at 913 (White, J. concurring). This Court has previously held that \u201c[the] petitioner\u2019s silence when the officer accosted him ...

Hale, </em>422 U.S. 171, 176, 95 S.Ct. 2133, 2136, 45 L.Ed.2d 99 (1975)). Essentially, the petitioner was standing next to a house in a residential area, not doing anything in particular, with the odor of ether emanating from his person, when he failed to respond to police questioning for reasons unknown to the officer. Based on these facts, the totality of the circumstances does not support the conclusion that Officer Lewis had probable cause to arrest the petitioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-5\">\u201c[A] search conducted without a warrant supported by probable cause is <em>per se </em>unreasonable under the Fourth Amendment, subject to only a few exceptions.\u201d <em>Belote, </em>411 Md. at 112, 981 A.2d at 1252 (quoting <em>Cherry v.

A search incident to a lawful arrest is a well-established exception to the warrant requirement. <em>United States v. Robinson, </em>414 U.S. 218, 224, 94 S.Ct. 467, 471, 38 L.Ed.2d 427, 434 (1973); <em>Chimel v.

Thus, because Officer Lewis did not make a lawful arrest when he seized the petitioner, the subsequent warrantless search of the petitioner was not within an exception to the warrant requirement and therefore violated the Fourth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-5\">JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS IS REVERSED.

There was no clear evidence presented at the suppression hearing about the relationship between the odor of ether and the presence of PCP.

Officer Lewis was not qualified as a Drug Recognition Expert or expert witness. <em>See Ragland v.

The State also relies on a similar case, <em>United States v. Fattaleh, </em>746 F.Supp. 599, 600 (D.Md.1990), in which a police officer lawfully stopped Fattaleh for speeding. During the course of the stop, the officer noticed an \"acrid\u201d odor that, based on his law enforcement experience, he identified as \"the type [of odor] which emanates from this drug [PCP].\u201d <em>Id. </em>Based on the odor, the officer searched Fattaleh\u2019s vehicle and found two \"dippers,\u201d or cigarettes dipped in liquid PCP. <em>Id. </em>The United States District Court for the District of Maryland held that \"the smell of PCP established the probable cause to search the car\u201d and, accordingly, upheld the validity of the search. <em>Fattaleh, </em>746 F.Supp. at 602. Like in <em>Minnick v.

For example, in <em>People v. Darby, </em>263 A.D.2d 112, 701 N.Y.S.2d 395, 396-97 (N.Y.App.Div.2000), a defense expert testified that unadulterated PCP has no smell, but a police officer testified that the street drug, which is not unadulterated, has a distinctive smell. The officer, in <em>Darby, </em>did not mention the word ether. To assume that the odors discussed in <em>Minnick </em>and <em>Fattaleh </em>are the same as the odor of ether in the present case requires more than an inference or a presumption. It would be tantamount to judicial notice, which we refrain to do. Because we Cannot determine whether the odor in <em>Fattaleh </em>is that of the contraband itself or of a lawful substance allegedly associated with contraband, the District Court\u2019s analysis is not persuasive.

Although paying lip service to a totality of the circumstances analysis, the Majority opinion actually employs a divide-and-conquer consideration of some, but not all, of the factors available to Officer Lewis on the night in question.

In a similar vein, the Majority opinion attempts, by mis-characterizing the State\u2019s case here as solely premised on the odor of ether, to distinguish the many cases where the smell of ether, coupled with other indicia of suspicious activity or circumstances, was found to supply probable cause. The record <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>here, however, reviewed in a light most favorable to the State as the prevailing party below, revealed much more than the mere smell of ether:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-5\">\u2022 prior citizen complaints about the particular area experiencing high illegal drug activity;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-6\">\u2022 Bailey was standing in the shadows of the side of the townhouse at 11:35 p.m.;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-7\">\u2022 he did not respond at all to Officer Lewis\u2019 questions whether Bailey lived in the townhouse;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-8\">\u2022 his eyes were glassy; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-9\">\u2022 he reeked of ether.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b419-10\">These factors, coupled with Lewis\u2019 training that enabled him to discern the singular smell of ether and his knowledge regarding a relationship between ether and POP, were ample cause to arrest Bailey and search his person. To conclude otherwise is to overlook the relevant principle that courts should respect an officer\u2019s ability to draw on his or her own experience and training to draw inferences and deductions from the cumulative information available to him or her that \u201cmight well elude an untrained person.\u201d <em>Arvizu, </em>534 U.S. at 273, 122 S.Ct. at 750-51, 151 L.Ed.2d at 749-50 (quoting <em>United States v.

Some of the roles of ether in the drug culture have been noted in popular literary works. Recreational use of diethyl ether was portrayed in the novel <em>Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas: A Savage Journey to the Heart of the American Dream </em>by Hunter S. Thompson (Random House <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>1971, at 43), who compared its effects to the behavior of a \"village drunkard in some early Irish novel.\u201d It also was portrayed in the novel <em>The Cider House Rules </em>by John Irving (William Morrow 1985) and in the film adaptation of the same name.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b416-6\">. The State developed on direct examination during the suppression hearing Officer Lewis' basis to recognize the smell of ether and an association of ether with PCP:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-7\">Q. Now, officer, you said that you smelled a strong odor of ether; is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-8\">A. Yes, ma\u2019am.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-9\">Q. Have you ever come in contact, during your five and a half years with the Prince George's County Police Department, with phencyclidine?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-10\">A. Yes, ma\u2019am.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-11\">Q. Does phencyclidine have an odor?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-12\">A. An odor of ether.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-13\">Q. How many times have you come into contact with phencyclidine?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-14\">A. Hundreds.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-15\">Q. How many arrests have you made where phencyclidine was present?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-16\">A. Hundreds.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-17\">Q. Have you had any training during your five and a half years with respect to the odor and appearance of phencyclidine?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-18\">A. I have, ma'am.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-19\">Q. Can you detail that for Your Honor?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-20\">A. I received training in basic schools, the academy, and also follow-up classes, investigative classes, which were drug related after graduating from the academy.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b416-21\">. In direct examination, Officer Lewis stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-22\">Q. And the odor of ether that you smelled, you indicated that was about the defendant\u2019s person, correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-23\">A. Yes, correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-24\">Q. Approximately, how far away from the defendant were you when you smelled this odor of ether?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-25\">A. Maybe just a few f[ee]t. I was able to reach out and touch him.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b416-26\">. The cases recognize at least two main roles that ether plays in the life cycle of PCP: (1) as a precipitating agent in the manufacturing of <em>PCP\u2014see Porter v. Terhune, </em>2006 U.S. Dist. Lexis 96690 at *20 (C.D.Cal. March 1, 2006); and (2) as an evaporating agent in the preparation of cigarettes laced with <em>PCP\u2014see U.S. v. Dorsey, </em>921 F.2d 785, 788 (8th Cir.1990); <em>U.S. </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>871 F.2d 80, 81 (8th Cir.1989).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b417-6\">. The Majority opinion makes much of an obvious typographical error in the transcription of the suppression hearing testimony. During direct examination, Officer Lewis explained as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b417-7\">Q. Have you, during the course [of] your employment, come into contact with individuals under the influence of phencyclidine?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b417-8\">A. Yes, I have.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b417-9\">Q. Approximately, how many times?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b417-10\">A. Hundreds.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b417-11\">Q. During those hundreds of times that you've come into contact with those individuals, are they characteristics that are similar to those individuals who are under the influence of phencyclidine?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b417-12\">A. Yes. It varies from person to person.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b417-13\">Q. Okay. What are some of the general characteristics of a an individual under the influence of phencyclidine?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b417-14\">A. Normally, they possess various strengths, sometimes they could be incoherent in reference to trying to understand if someone is saying something to them, and very <em>glossy </em>eyes, which the defendant had at the time.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b417-15\">(Emphasis added.) The next question posed by the prosecutor was as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b417-16\">Q. Other than the defendant having <em>glassy </em>eyes, are there any other characteristics that the defendant had on the night that you came into contact with him that would be reminiscent of someone under the influence of phencyclidine?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b417-17\">A. No response once I was asking him questions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b417-18\">THE COURT: I'm sorry. No response to what?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b417-19\">THE WITNESS: When I asked the defendant a question, I got no response from him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b417-20\">BY MS. STEUART:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b417-21\">Q. Other than asking the defendant whether he lived where he was standing, do you recall asking him anything else?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b417-22\">A. No, ma\u2019am.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b417-23\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b417-24\">It is clear to me that the prosecutor heard Officer Lewis say \u201cglassy,\u201d not \u201cglossy,\u201d initially and his follow up question was framed accordingly. As to when in the confrontation Lewis noticed Bailey\u2019s glassy eyes, the State\u2019s evidence (because it was the prevailing party below) is entitled to a reasonable inference that Lewis noted the quality of Bailey\u2019s eyes contemporaneously with detecting the odor of ether and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>Bailey\u2019s unresponsiveness to questioning. The inference derives from the proximity of the two of them at the time Lewis smelled the ether and the common sense notion that Lewis likely looked at Bailey\u2019s face at the same time.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b418-7\">.
