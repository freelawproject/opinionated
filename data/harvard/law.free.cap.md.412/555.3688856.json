We are precluded from answering that question, however, because this case is before us on appeal from an order that is neither a final judgment nor an appealable interlocutory order. Accordingly, we shall vacate the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals and direct that the appeal be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-9\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-10\">On November 21, 2006, Petitioners Judith and Albert Schuele entered into a home improvement contract with Shaun Arnold, a Baltimore County contractor and franchisee of Respondents Case Handyman Services, LLC and/or Case Design/Remodeling, Inc.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Although Respondents and Petitioners refer to Mr. Arnold\u2019s home improvement company as Professional Home Repair, Inc. (\u201cPHR\u201d), Mr. Arnold signed the contract as \u201cCase Handyman Services\u201d and accepted a $39,800 check payable to the order of \u201cCase Handyman Services\u201d as down payment on the contract.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b589-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>The contract consists of eight pages, sets forth a payment schedule, and describes the work Mr. Arnold was expected to complete. Printed on the back of each page of the contract is the \u201cfine print,\u201d which is titled \u201cGeneral Conditions\u201d and contains an arbitration clause. The arbitration clause provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b589-4\">2. CLAIMS\u2014Any controversy/claim arising out of or relating to this contract or its breach thereof, shall be settled by final and binding arbitration before a single arbitrator in the Baltimore metropolitan area in accordance with the Construction Industry Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association and judgment upon the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b589-5\">(Underlining in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b589-6\">Under the contract, Mr. Arnold agreed to perform \u201cremodeling and/or repair work\u201d on Petitioners\u2019 home in Towson, Maryland. After accepting Petitioners\u2019 down payment, however, Mr. Arnold performed no work on the contract except to draft written plans for the remodeling project, for which Petitioners paid an additional $2,700. During the next several months, Petitioners made several requests that Mr. Arnold set a work schedule and begin work, but in March 2007, Mr. Arnold told Petitioners that \u201che no longer had their funds\u201d and would not begin work on the project. Mr. Arnold also told Petitioners that he was considering filing for bankruptcy. Petitioners alleged in their complaint that Mr. Arnold has since filed for personal bankruptcy, naming PHR as his home improvement company in the filings.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-7\">\n<em>The Lawsuit</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b589-8\">On June 6, 2007, Petitioners filed a class action complaint against Respondents in the Circuit Court for Baltimore County. Petitioners alleged breach of contract (Counts I &amp; II), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>fraud by misappropriation (Counts III &amp; IV), fraud or deceit (Count V), violations of the Maryland Consumer Protection Act (Count VI), and negligence (Count VII). In response, based on the arbitration clause in the contract between Petitioners and Mr. Arnold, Respondents filed a \u201cMotion to Dismiss, or in the Alternative, to Compel Arbitration and Stay Proceedings\u201d accompanied by a memorandum of law in support of the motion and a request for a hearing. In an order dated September 7, 2007, without a hearing, the Circuit Court granted Respondents\u2019 motion to compel arbitration without explanation, noting that Petitioners had filed no response. The record indicates, however, that Petitioners filed a response to Respondents\u2019 motion on August 31, 2007. On September 17, 2007, in an open court proceeding conducted without the parties\u2019 knowledge, the Circuit Court struck its order and denied Respondents\u2019 motion without written order. On September 24, 2007, Respondents filed a \u201cMotion to Alter or Amend Judgment\u201d and a request for a hearing. Petitioners filed their opposition to the motion to amend on October 11, 2007, and the Circuit Court denied Respondents\u2019 motion to amend and request for a hearing in an order dated October 18, 2007. On November 2, 2007, Respondents noted an appeal to the Court of Special Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-5\">The Court of Special Appeals held that the Circuit Court erred in denying Respondents\u2019 motion to compel arbitration. <em>Case Handyman &amp; Remodeling Servs., LLC v. Schuele, </em>183 Md.App. 44, 49, 959 A.2d 833, 836 (2008). The court first addressed whether either the Federal Arbitration Act (\u201cFAA\u201d), 9 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1 <em>et. seq., </em>or the Maryland Uniform Arbitration Act (\u201cMUAA\u201d), Md.Code (2006 RepLVoL), \u00a7\u00a7 3-201 <em>et. seq. of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article </em>(\u201cC.J.\u201d), governed the contract at issue. The court determined that, regardless of whether the FAA applied to the contract, the application of the MUAA \u201cprovides the same result.\u201d <em>Case Handyman, </em>183 Md.App. at 54-56, 959 A.2d at 839-40. The court held that, because \u201cthe Schueles\u2019 allegations [arose] out of and directly relate[d] to their contract with PHR,\u201d Respondents, non-signatories to the contract, could <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>enforce the contract\u2019s arbitration clause against Petitioners based on principles of equitable estoppel frequently applied by federal courts in arbitration cases.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 57-58, 68, 959 A.2d at 841-42, 844^5.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-5\">Next, the Court of Special Appeals held that the arbitration clause was valid even though it did not fully comply with the Code of Maryland Regulations (\u201cCOMAR\u201d) 09.08.01.25, in part, because \u201cCOMAR 09.08.01.25 does not contain any penalty provisions or state that an arbitration clause is invalid if it fails to comply with the requirements of the regulation.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>Case Handyman, </em>183 Md.App. at 68, 959 A.2d at 847. Moreover, the court noted that any instances of non-compliance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>were minor and the clause was sufficiently conspicuous to give Petitioners notice. <em>Id. </em>at 70, 959 A.2d at 848-49.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-5\">Petitioners filed a petition for <em>unit of certiorari </em>presenting three questions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-6\">I. Did the Court of Special Appeals err in adopting federal law as controlling on the issue of whether equitable estoppel could be invoked by a non-party to a contract in order to enforce an arbitration provision, rather than applying state law to determine the provision\u2019s enforceability?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-7\">II. Did the Court of Special Appeals err in holding that Petitioners were equitably estopped from avoiding contractual arbitration with a non-party, where the non-party disavows any cognizable connection to the contract at issue, and where the agreement does not manifest any intent or agreement to arbitrate the legal or factual issues related to Respondents\u2019 own wrongdoing?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-8\">III. Did the Court of Special Appeals err in holding that a home improvement contract\u2019s arbitration provision may be judicially enforced even though the provision does not comply with the notice requirements imposed on such provisions under COMAR?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b592-9\">We shall not address these questions because the appeal of the Circuit Court\u2019s order denying Respondents\u2019 motion to compel arbitration did not constitute a final judgment and was not an appealable interlocutory order.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b593-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>II.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-5\">In Maryland, appellate jurisdiction, except as constitutionally created, is statutorily granted. <em>Gruber v. Gruber, </em>369 Md. 540, 546, 801 A.2d 1013, 1016 (2002); <em>Kant v. Montgomery County, </em>365 Md. 269, 273, 778 A.2d 384, 386 (2001). \u201cWhere appellate jurisdiction is lacking, the appellate court will dismiss the appeal on its own motion.\u201d <em>Gruber, </em>369 Md. at 546, 801 A.2d at 1016.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-6\">Recently, we emphasized in <em>Addison v. Lochearn Nursing Home, LLC, </em>411 Md. 251, 983 A.2d 138 (2009), that \u00a7 12-301 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article of the Maryland Code authorizes appeals only from \u201ca final judgment entered in a civil or criminal case by a circuit court.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> 411 Md. at 261, 983 A.2d at 145 (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). Generally, to constitute a final judgment, a trial court\u2019s ruling \u201cmust either decide and conclude the rights of the parties involved or deny a party the means to prosecute or defend rights and interests in the subject matter of the proceeding.\u201d <em>Nnoli v. Nnoli, </em>389 Md. 315, 324, 884 A.2d 1215, 1219-20 (2005). Moreover, to be a final judgment in a controversy involving multiple claims, the order must dispose of all claims in the action. <em>See </em>Md. Rule 2-602(a) (\u201c[A]n order or other form of decision, however designated, that adjudicates fewer than all of the claims in an action ... is not a final judgment.\u201d); <em>Addison, </em>411 Md. at 271, 983 A.2d at 150; <em>Rohrbeck v. Rohrbeck, </em>318 Md. 28, 41, 566 A.2d 767, 773 (1989) (noting that an order is not a final judgment if it does not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>\u201cadjudicate or complete the adjudication of all claims against all parties\u201d). \u201cAn order that is not a final judgment is an interlocutory order and ordinarily is not appealable[.]\u201d <em>Nnoli, </em>389 Md. at 324, 884 A.2d at 1220.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-4\">This case is before us on appeal from the Circuit Court\u2019s denial of Respondents\u2019 motion to compel arbitration. Because the Circuit Court\u2019s order did not adjudicate all claims in the action and was therefore not a final judgment as contemplated by \u00a7 12-301, we must treat this as an appeal from an interlocutory order. Interlocutory orders are immediately appealable only under three narrow exceptions to the final judgment rule. <em>Nnoli </em>389 Md. at 324, 884 A.2d at 1220. Those exceptions are: \u201cappeals from interlocutory orders specifically allowed by statute; immediate appeals permitted under Maryland Rule 2-602; and appeals from interlocutory rulings allowed under the common law collateral order doctrine.\u201d <em>Addison, </em>411 Md. at 274, 983 A.2d at 152 (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b594-5\">\n<em>Appealable Interlocutory Orders</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b594-6\">Section 12-303 expressly allows appeals from certain interlocutory orders.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The Circuit Court\u2019s order denying Re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>spondents\u2019 motion to compel arbitration does not fall within any provision of \u00a7 12-303. <em>See Addison, </em>411 Md. at 274-84, 983 A.2d at 153-58 (holding that \u00a7 12-303(3)(ix), which allows appeals from orders granting a petition to stay arbitration, does not permit appeals from interlocutory orders denying a motion to compel arbitration). Therefore, \u00a7 12-303 does not confer appellate jurisdiction over this matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-4\">\n<em>Final Judgment Certification</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b595-5\">Under Rule 2-602(b), a trial judge may certify as a final judgment an order that adjudicates only some of the rights at issue, even though other claims between the parties remain unadjudicated.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>Maryland-Nat\u2019l Capital Park &amp; </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number><em>Planning Comm\u2019n v.

Mortimer, </em>310 Md. 639, 651, 530 A.2d 1237, 1243 (1987) (\u201c[A] prerequisite for the invocation of the certification procedure embodied in Rule 2-602(b) is an order which, absent the circumstance of multiple parties or multiple claims, would be final in the traditional sense.\u201d); <em>see also Med.

It cannot make a nonfinal order into a final order.\u201d). In other words, \u201cRule 2-602 does not operate to modify one of the statutory conditions for appellate jurisdiction\u2014the existence of a final judgment.\u201d <em>Mortimer, </em>310 Md. at 649, 530 A.2d at 1242.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-4\">To be deemed final in the traditional sense, an order \u201cmust be completely dispositive of an entire claim or party.\u201d <em>B.

The most frequently cited limitation on a trial court\u2019s discretion to direct the entry of a final judgment is that the court must expressly determine in a written order that there is no just reason for delay of the appeal. <em>Mortimer, </em>310 Md. at 648, 530 A.2d at 1241-42 (\u201cIn the exceptional case, the trial judge may decide that early appellate decision of a particular point is of sufficient importance, or that delay will produce sufficient hardship or unfairness, to outweigh the general policy against piecemeal appeals.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b598-5\">The Circuit Court in this case was not petitioned to certify its order denying Respondents\u2019 motion to compel arbitration; therefore, we need not address this condition to determine whether certification is appropriate. Instead, we must examine whether the Circuit Court\u2019s order denying Respondents\u2019 motion to compel arbitration is, as the law requires, \u201cfinal in the traditional sense.\u201d <em>Mortimer, </em>310 Md. at 651, 530 A.2d at 1243.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-6\">The Circuit Court\u2019s order conclusively denied Respondents\u2019 \u201cMotion to Dismiss, or in the Alternative, to Compel Arbitration and Stay Proceedings\u201d and thus finally settled Respondents\u2019 sole claim.

More specifically, in the context of arbitration, we have held that an order compelling arbitration of a controversy is immediately appealable as a final judgment even though \u201cit does not finally dispose of all claims in the action in which it was filed\u201d because the order \u201chas the effect of putting the parties out of court.\u201d <em>Town of Chesapeake Beach v.

Conversely, \u201c[w]e have held that a trial court\u2019s order denying a challenge to its jurisdiction is a nonappealable interlocutory order\u201d because the order \u201cdoes not settle or conclude the rights of any party or deny him the means of proceeding further.\u201d <em>Gruber, </em>369 Md. at 547, 801 A.2d at 1017 (internal quotation marks and citations omitted); <em>Highfield Water Co. v.

Moreover, like an order denying a jurisdictional challenge, an order denying a motion to compel arbitration asserts a court\u2019s jurisdiction over the controversy and leaves the parties free to resolve the underlying dispute in a judicial forum. <em>See Gruber, </em>369 Md. at 547-48, 801 A.2d at 1017 (\u201cWhenever a court makes a disposition or order, it does so on the basis that it has jurisdiction, and if its express announcement of that fact constituted an appealable order, it would be impossible for a court to proceed with the trial of any case in which its jurisdiction was challenged.\u201d) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). For these reasons, an order denying a motion to compel arbitration is not final in the traditional sense. <em>See Addison, </em>411 Md. at 273, 983 A.2d at 151. Consequently, we cannot certify as a final judgment, under Rule 8-602(e), the Circuit Court\u2019s order denying Respondents\u2019 motion to compel arbitration.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-4\">\n<em>The Collateral Order Doctrine</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b600-5\">\u201cThis Court has made clear ... that the collateral order doctrine in Maryland is very limited.\u201d <em>Walker v.

The doctrine permits premature appeals from a limited class of cases in which the order appealed does not adjudicate all claims against all parties but \u201c(1) conclusively determines the disputed question, (2) resolves an important issue, (3) resolves an issue that is completely separate from the merits of the action, <em>and </em>(4) would be effectively unreviewable if the appeal had to await the entry of a final judgment.\u201d <em>Id., </em>895 A.2d at 1033 (internal quotation marks and citations omitted); <em>accord Addison, </em>411 Md. at 284-85, 983 A.2d at 158; <em>Dawkins v. Baltimore City Police Dept., </em>376 Md. 53, 58, 827 A.2d 115, 118 (2003). In <em>Addison, </em>we emphasized that this doctrine should be applied sparingly in only the most extraordinary circumstances. 411 Md. at 285, 983 A.2d at 158; <em>see also Washing</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number><em>ton Suburban Sanitary Comm\u2019n v.

In fact, Respondents assert that the only requirement not clearly established is that the order would be effectively unreviewable on appeal from a final judgment. Respondents argue that their motion is effectively unreviewable on appeal because their sole objective is to resolve this dispute through arbitration and \u201cthereby avoid litigation in any other forum.\u201d Moreover, Respondents argue that requiring them to wait for a final judgment before appealing renders them powerless to defend their right to arbitrate the dispute because they will necessarily be forced to litigate the dispute in the interim.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-5\">Not surprisingly, Petitioners disagree. They contend that applying the collateral order doctrine to the order denying Respondents\u2019 petition to compel arbitration would \u201cnot only undermine the collateral order doctrine, but would render meaningless the result in <em>Addison v. Lochearn.\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b601-6\">We agree with Respondents that the first three requirements of the doctrine are satisfied. First, the order conclusively determines whether Petitioners\u2019 claims should be resolved in arbitration by relegating the dispute to a judicial forum. <em>See Town of Chesapeake, </em>330 Md. at 754-55, 625 A.2d at 1019-20 (addressing whether an order denying a stay of arbitration is reviewable under the collateral order doctrine). Second, the order necessarily resolves an important issue because it \u201cdetermines the forum in which the claims will be settled.\u201d <em>See id. </em>at 755, 625 A.2d at 1020 (\u201cIf the parties are incorrectly forced into the wrong forum, the loss to each may be significant.\u201d). Third, the order settles a question completely separate from the merits of the action because it determines only the forum in which the parties should settle their dispute <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>without reaching any of Petitioners\u2019 claims against Respondents.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-4\">We are not persuaded, however, that this order would be effectively unreviewable on appeal. In <em>Addison, </em>we held that an order denying a motion to compel arbitration was not reviewable under the collateral order doctrine because the motion was not effectively unreviewable on appeal from a final judgment. 411 Md. at 285-87, 983 A.2d at 158-60. The party seeking appellate review in <em>Addison </em>attempted to bifurcate the action into two forums, arbitration of the counterclaims and litigation of the original claims, and thereby would have prolonged the litigation and increased the cost of the dispute. <em>Id. </em>at 287, 983 A.2d at 159. Respondents argue that <em>Addison </em>is distinguishable from this case because Respondents seek to remove the entire dispute to arbitration. Respondents further contrast <em>Addison </em>by pointing out that the aggrieved party in that case had filed the original claims in Circuit Court. <em>Id., </em>983 A.2d at 159. Petitioners argue that this distinction is insufficient to establish the extraordinary circumstances necessary to merit appellate review under the collateral order doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-5\">Generally, interlocutory orders denying a party\u2019s purported right to avoid a trial and the related \u201crigors of defending a lawsuit\u201d are not reviewable under the collateral order doctrine. <em>See Bowen, </em>410 Md. at 298-302, 978 A.2d at 685-87 (highlighting this Court\u2019s jurisprudence establishing the \u201cprinciple that interlocutory orders denying immunity are not appealable\u201d); <em>Nnoli, </em>389 Md. at 329, 884 A.2d at 1223 (\u201cThe mere fact that an order denies a claim of a right to avoid participating in some aspects of the legal proceedings in the trial court does not mean the order presents an extraordinary situation satisfying the fourth prong of the collateral order doctrine.\u201d). \u201c \u2018[T]he idea that an issue is not effectively reviewable after the termination of the trial because it involves a \u2018right\u2019 to avoid the trial itself, should be limited to double jeopardy claims and a very few other extraordinary situations.\u2019 \u201d <em>Dawkins, </em>376 Md. at 61, 827 A.2d at 119 (quoting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number><em>Bunting v. State, </em>312 Md. 472, 481-82, 540 A.2d 805, 809 (1988)).</p>\n<p id=\"b603-4\">We have addressed in multiple cases the appealability of orders denying the so-called right to avoid trial. In <em>Nnoli, </em>we held that an order denying a defendant\u2019s motion to quash an arrest warrant did not present an extraordinary situation sufficient to satisfy the fourth prong of the collateral order doctrine. 389 Md. at 329, 884 A.2d at 1223. Moreover, we held in <em>Dawkins </em>that \u201cinterlocutory trial court orders rejecting defenses of common law sovereign immunity, governmental immunity, public official immunity, statutory immunity, or any other type of immunity, are not appealable under the Maryland collateral order doctrine.\u201d 376 Md. at 65, 827 A.2d at 122. Most recently, in <em>Addison, </em>we held that an order denying a motion to compel arbitration did not present a case that finally determined rights \u201c\u2018too important to be denied review,\u2019 \u201d and therefore we denied review under the fourth prong of the collateral order doctrine. 411 Md. at 287, 983 A.2d at 159 (quoting <em>Cohen v. Beneficial Indus. Loan Corp., </em>337 U.S. 541, 546, 69 S.Ct. 1221, 1225-26, 93 L.Ed. 1528, 1536 (1949)).</p>\n<p id=\"b603-5\">Unlike in <em>Addison, </em>the party seeking appellate review in this case did not institute the original action and is not seeking to bifurcate the action into two separate forums. This distinction, however, is not dispositive. We are not persuaded by Respondents\u2019 contention that this appeal is effectively unreviewable after a final judgment because the benefits of the arbitration agreement\u2014an expeditious and more affordable resolution of the controversy in a non-judicial forum\u2014will be permanently lost. Essentially, Respondents are arguing that they have a right to avoid trial and this right is sufficiently important to warrant immediate judicial review of the Circuit Court\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-6\">We effectively summarized in <em>Bunting </em>the pitfalls of allowing appeals based on a party\u2019s right to avoid trial:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b603-7\">Another difficulty with the defendant\u2019s argument is that numerous \u201crights\u201d can readily be characterized as entitling <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>a party to avoid trial under some circumstances. For example, the \u201cright\u201d to summary judgment might be characterized as a right not to stand trial unless the opposing party has created a genuine issue of material fact. Similarly, the statute of limitations might be characterized as granting a defendant a right not to be tried out of time. If all \u201crights\u201d which could be characterized in this manner were treated like the right against double jeopardy, the collateral order doctrine would largely erode the final judgment rule. Consequently, it is important that we narrowly construe the notion of an entitlement not to be sued or prosecuted.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b604-4\">312 Md. at 479-80, 540 A.2d at 808 (internal citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b604-5\">A potential right to settle a controversy in a nonjudicial forum presents circumstances no more extraordinary than a right to avoid a lawsuit entirely. <em>Id. </em>at 480-82, 540 A.2d at 808-09. A party\u2019s right to avoid trial is not reviewable under the collateral order doctrine except to enforce the constitutional protection against double jeopardy and in \u201cvery few other extraordinary situations.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 481-82, 540 A.2d at 809.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-6\">Respondents\u2019 purported right to settle this controversy in a non-judicial forum presents circumstances much less extraordinary than a criminal defendant\u2019s right against being placed twice in jeopardy of life and limb for the same offense. The double jeopardy protection is singular because it guarantees that a criminal defendant shall not endure the ordeal of a second trial. <em>Parrott v. State, </em>301 Md. 411, 425, 483 A.2d 68, 75 (1984). That right, once violated, cannot be restored by a reversal of the second conviction because the offense is not the second trial\u2019s outcome but the second trial itself. <em>Id., </em>483 A.2d at 75. A valid right to arbitrate a dispute, however, does not guarantee that a party will never have to endure judicial resolution of the controversy. An enforceable arbitration agreement promises only that the <em>final and controlling </em>decision in the relevant controversy will be' obtained through arbitration. Unlike the protection against double jeopardy, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>the right to arbitrate a dispute may be vindicated by vacating any intervening judicial decree and relegating the controversy to arbitration for final resolution. Therefore, the Circuit Court\u2019s order denying Respondents\u2019 motion to compel arbitration does not present sufficient extraordinary circumstances to render it appealable under the collateral order doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-4\">Respondents may challenge the order denying their motion to compel arbitration after a final judgment has been rendered on the merits of this case. <em>See Addison, </em>411 Md. at 286, 983 A.2d at 159 (noting that the \u201cassertion of error regarding the denial of the motion to compel would be reviewable on appeal\u201d); <em>see also Bunting, </em>312 Md. at 477-78, 540 A.2d at 807-OS (holding that a defendant\u2019s appeal from an order denying his challenge to the single transfer rule was reviewable on appeal from a final judgment of conviction). If an appellate court later determines that the controversy should have been arbitrated, then the case will be dismissed, the Circuit Court\u2019s judgment will be vacated, and Respondents will be free to resolve the controversy in arbitration. <em>See Bowen, </em>410 Md. at 297, 978 A.2d at 685 (concluding that if the complaining party is \u201cactually immune from suit under the circumstances, the judgment will be reversed on appeal and the trial court will be directed to dismiss the action. Consequently, in this respect, the fourth requirement of the collateral order doctrine is obviously not satisfied.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b605-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-6\">In sum, an order denying a motion to compel arbitration is neither a final judgment nor an appealable interlocutory order. Accordingly, we vacate the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals and remand the case to that court with the direction to dismiss the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-7\">JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS VACATED AND CASE REMANDED TO THAT COURT WITH INSTRUCTIONS TO DISMISS THE APPEAL.
