In addition to the repayment of principal and its attendant interest upon maturity or sale of all or any portion of the property, the promise to pay also included a provision for payment of \u201cAdditional Contingent Interest,\u201d \u201c[i]n order to compensate the Holder for accepting an interest rate equal to the Libor Rate, and further to compensate the Holder for granting the Borrower the exculpation from liability provided in [the Note].\u201d Additional Contingent Interest was defined as \u201c35% of the difference between Gross Revenue and Approved Costs, calculated at a time or times specified in this Note,\u201d while Gross Revenue was defined as \u201cthe greater of the sales price or gross sales proceeds payable in connection with the sale of all or any portion of the Property securing this Note.\u201d A Deed of Trust and Security Agreement also were executed on the same day, as well as a Guaranty Agreement executed by Miller and Smith Holding, Inc., a Virginia corporation.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In 2001, Potomac transferred its rights under the Note and the Guaranty to Casey PMN, LLC which then became the Holder under the Note and the Guaranty and the Beneficiary under the Deed of Trust.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>In 2002, under threat of imminent condemnation of the property, Miller and Smith entered into an Agreement with Montgomery County for the sale of the property, for the purpose of open space conservation. Under the Agreement, the property was divided into six parcels, and the County was to make five cash payments between November 2002 and July 2006 totaling $9,025,500 to Miller and Smith upon the conveyance of the six separate parcels of land, as follows: Parcel 1 (85.79 acres) for $3,000,000 on November 15, 2002; Parcel 2 (63.52 acres) for $2,221,500 on July 1, 2003; Parcel 3 (50.16 acres) for $1,754,000 on July 1, 2004; Parcels 4A and 4B (27.91 and 16.41 acres, respectively) for $1,550,000 on July 1, 2005; and Parcel 5 (14.3 acres) for $500,000 on July 1, 2006. Montgomery County also agreed to provide a letter to the Internal Revenue Service \u201cacknowledging that [Miller and Smith] was paid the above amounts for the Property and acknowledging that [Miller and Smith] claims that the fair market value of the Property is not less than $17,100,000.\u201d The County took no position on the actual fair market value of the property, but included $17,100,000 in the Agreement to enable Miller and Smith to attempt to take advantage of any possible tax benefits. According to the parties, the entire $9,025,500 has been paid to Miller and Smith and, in turn, Miller and Smith has transferred all parcels of the property to the County.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-4\">Miller and Smith paid Casey Additional Contingent Interest under the promissory note, based on the $9,025,500 paid by Montgomery County, but Casey did not agree with the computation and claimed that the calculation should have included not only the $9 million, but additional tax benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-5\">Casey, thereafter, filed a four count complaint in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County against Miller and Smith and Miller and Smith Holding, Inc., alleging that Miller and Smith had \u201cnot properly calculated and paid Additional Contingent Interest to Casey based on the fair market value of the Property, as contemplated by the Note and Deed of Trust ....,\u201d prefacing the following four Counts with the factual recitations noted above:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b262-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>\n<em>COUNT I (BREACH OF NOTE AND DEED OF TRUST\u2014DAMAGES)</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b262-4\">18. Casey incorporates the preceding paragraphs of its Complaint by reference as if set forth herein.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b262-5\">19. Miller and Smith\u2019s failure to pay Casey the full amount of Additional Contingent Interest due under the Note, calculated as 35% of the fair market value of the Property, as contemplated by the terms of the Note, constitutes a breach of the Note and the Deed of Trust.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b262-6\">20. As a result of Miller and Smith\u2019s breach of the Note and the Deed of Trust, Casey has suffered substantial financial harm.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b262-7\">21. Under the terms of the Note, in addition to the Additional Contingent Interest due but unpaid, Miller and Smith is liable to Casey for all reasonable costs of collection of amounts due under the Note, including reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b262-8\">\n<em>COUNT II (ALTERNATIVE: BREACH OF NOTE AND DEED OF TRUST\u2014DAMAGES)</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b262-9\">22. Casey incorporates the preceding paragraphs of its Complaint by reference as if set forth herein.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b262-10\">23. Miller and Smith\u2019s failure to pay Casey the full amount of Additional Contingent Interest due under the Note, calculated as 35% of all compensation received by its members, including by their use of the charitable deductions derived from the sale of the Property to the County at below fair market value, constitutes a breach of the Note and the Deed of Trust.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b262-11\">\n<em>COUNT III (BREACH OF THE NOTE AND DEED OF TRUST SPECIFIC PERFORMANCEINJUNCTIVE RELIEF)</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b262-12\">24. Casey incorporates the preceding paragraphs of its Complaint by reference as if set forth herein.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b263-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>25. Miller and Smith\u2019s refusal to permit Casey to inspect its books and records for the purpose of, <em>inter alia, </em>assessing whether Miller and Smith has accurately calculated the Approved Costs that it is permitted to deduct from \u201cGross Revenue\u201d in determining the amount of Additional Contingent Interest due under the Note constitutes a breach of the terms of the Note and the Deed of Trust.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b263-4\">26. Without inspecting and examining the books and records maintained by Miller &amp; Smith, Casey has not been able to determine whether Miller and Smith has deducted more as \u201cApproved Costs\u201d from \u201cGross Revenue\u201d in making payments of Additional Contingent Interest to Casey under the Note than is proper.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b263-5\">\n<em>COUNT IV (BREACH OF THE GUARANTY)</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b263-6\">27. Casey incorporates the preceding paragraphs of its Complaint by reference as if set forth herein.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b263-7\">28. Under the Guaranty, M &amp; S Holding is jointly and severally liable with Miller &amp; Smith to Casey for injury it suffers as a result of Miller and Smith\u2019s failure to make proper payment of Additional Contingent Interest and Miller and Smith\u2019s failure to meet other obligations under the terms of the Note and the Deed of Trust.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b263-8\">29. As a result of Miller and Smith\u2019s breach of the Note and the Deed of Trust, Casey has suffered substantial injury for which M &amp; S is liable to Casey.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b263-9\">WHEREFORE, Plaintiff, Casey PMN, LLC, respectfully demands that the Court enter judgment in its favor against Defendants Miller and Smith at Quercus, LLC and M &amp; S Holding, Inc., jointly and severally, (a) awarding Casey PMN, LLC, compensatory damages in an amount to be proven at trial for unpaid Additional Contingent Interest, together with court costs and pre-and post-judgment interest, and costs of collection, including reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees, costs and expenses; (b) ordering Defendant Miller and Smith at Quercus to permit Casey PMN, LLC to inspect, examine and copy its books and records; and (c) granting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>such other and further relief as the Court deems just and proper.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b264-5\">Miller and Smith filed a Motion to Dismiss Count II, as well as an Answer to the remaining three counts of the Complaint, generally denying liability pursuant to Rule 2-323(d),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> after which Casey filed an Opposition to the Motion to Dismiss. Miller and Smith filed a Counterclaim for Declaratory Judgment alleging entitlement to damages based on Casey\u2019s wrongful claim that Miller and Smith and its holding company were obligated to pay Additional Contingent Interest based on $17,100,000 rather than the purchase price of $9,025,500; Casey filed an Answer to the Counterclaim generally denying liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-6\">The Circuit Court thereupon held a hearing on the Motion to Dismiss and in a written \u201cOpinion and Order,\u201d found that the terms of the contract were \u201cclear and unambiguous,\u201d and charitable tax deductions from the sale of land did not constitute \u201cAdditional Contingent Interest,\u201d thereby granting Miller and Smith\u2019s Motion to Dismiss Count II of the Complaint, and the docket entry reflected the fact that the case was not closed based on the partial judgment.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The parties, on August 22, 2007, then filed a joint \u201cStipulation of Dismissal\u201d pursuant to Rule 2-506,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> dismissing \u201cwith prejudice\u201d Counts I and III of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>the Complaint and also purportedly dismissing Count IV and the Counterclaim \u201cwith prejudice,\u201d but with an important caveat:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-4\">(a) Plaintiff is hereby dismissing Counts I and III of its Complaint with prejudice (Count II having previously been dismissed by interlocutory Opinion and Order granting Defendants\u2019 Motion to Dismiss Count II);</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-5\">(b) Plaintiff is hereby dismissing Count IV of its Complaint, with prejudice, except that, since Count IV includes a claim that Defendant Miller &amp; Smith Holding, Inc., is a guarantor with respect to the liability of Defendant Miller <em>&amp; </em>Smith at Quercus, LLC, as alleged in Count II, such dismissal shall be without prejudice to the extent that the Court\u2019s earlier interlocutory Opinion and Order dismissing Count II, is vacated or reversed on appeal and remanded to this Court; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-6\">(c) Defendant is hereby dismissing its Counterclaim with prejudice, except that such dismissal shall be without prejudice to the extent that the Court\u2019s earlier, interlocutory Opinion and Order dismissing Count II, is vacated or reversed on appeal and remanded to this Court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b266-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>Casey subsequently filed a Notice of Appeal stating that it \u201cnotices its appeal of the Court\u2019s Opinion and Order dismissing Count II of Plaintiffs Complaint in the above-captioned action, which Order became a final judgment upon the filing of a Stipulation of Dismissal, dismissing all then-pending claims and counterclaims in this matter on August 22, 2007.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b266-4\">The Court of Special Appeals reached the merits of. the controversy and reversed the Circuit Court, but, in a footnote, recognized the problem with the conditional language of the dismissal of Count IV and the Counterclaim:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b266-5\">The Stipulation was subject to the exception that the dismissal of the counterclaim and appellant\u2019s fourth count (against Miller &amp; Smith Holding as guarantor of the Note) would be without prejudice if the Opinion and Order dismissing Count II were vacated or reversed on appeal and remanded.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b266-6\">Ordinarily, \u201c[tjhere can be no final judgment until every claim is resolved, [but] dismissal is one of the means by which claims may be resolved for the purposes of the pending litigation.\u201d <em>Tierco Maryland, Inc. v. Williams, </em>381 Md. 378, 393, 849 A.2d 504 (2004). Maryland Rule 2-506(a)(2) provides that parties may \u201cdismiss all or part of [a] claim without leave of court ... by filing a stipulation of dismissal signed by all parties to the claim being dismissed.\u201d In this case, although the circuit court\u2019s grant of appellee\u2019s Motion to Dismiss Count II was not a final judgment, the parties\u2019 voluntary dismissal of the remaining claims, with prejudice, imparted finality to the court\u2019s Opinion and Order. We elaborate.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b266-7\">In <em>Collins v. Li, </em>158 Md.App. 252, 857 A.2d 135 (2004), we determined that Maryland adheres to the majority rule \u201c \u2018that a plaintiff cannot appeal from the dismissal of some claims when the balance of his or her claims have been voluntarily dismissed <em>without </em>prejudice.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 267, 857 A.2d 135 (quoting and adopting <em>Smith v. Lincoln Meadows Homeowners Ass\u2019n, Inc., </em>267 Neb. 849, 678 N.W.2d 726, 731 (2004)) (emphasis added.) <em>See also Cheng v. Comm\u2019r of </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number><em>IRS, </em>878 F.2d 306, 308-11 (9th Cir.1989) (also followed in Collins).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b267-4\">We do not perceive the parties\u2019 Stipulation of Dismissal to flout the final judgment rule, despite its caveat that appellee\u2019s counterclaim and \u201cCount IV\u201d of appellant\u2019s complaint were dismissed without prejudice to the extent that we vacate or reverse. On review of the record, appellee\u2019s counterclaim for declaratory judgment is limited to the same question presented by appellant\u2019s Count II, which was the subject of the circuit court\u2019s Opinion and Order: whether the term \u201cgross sales proceeds payable\u201d in the Note encompasses the financial gain realized from the charitable tax deductions at issue. Moreover, \u201cCount IV\u201d does not allege a separate substantive cause of action; it merely provides the basis for the joint and several liability of both appellees. The remaining substantive counts of appellant\u2019s complaint, Counts I and III, were dismissed \u201cwith prejudice.\u201d Thus, the parties have effectively reserved only the right to continue to litigate on the substantive grounds encompassed by Count II of appellant\u2019s complaint. The parties\u2019 stipulation, which has enabled this appeal to proceed, means that they may no longer litigate any other issues implicated by appellant\u2019s complaint.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b267-5\">Miller and Smith petitioned this Court for a writ of certiorari, which we granted, 408 Md. 148, 968 A.2d 1064 (2009), to address the following questions, which we have reordered:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b267-6\">I. May a party, through a voluntary dismissal <em>without </em>prejudice, cause a non-final judgment to become final?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b267-7\">II. Does the term \u201csales proceeds payable\u201d as used in a private contract incorporating Md.Code. Ann., Comm. Law, \u00a7 9-102(A)(65) include tax deductions for which the seller might be eligible?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b267-8\">III. May an appellate court construe an ambiguous contract as a matter of law without giving the parties an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>opportunity to present extrinsic evidence? [<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Aa1\">(Italics in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b268-4\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b268-5\">Our jurisprudence is replete with references to the fact that parties cannot agree to the exercise of our appellate jurisdiction, even when the Court of Special Appeals has exercised its review, because our jurisdiction is governed only by the Constitution, statutes, and the Rules. <em>See East v. Gilchrist, </em>293 Md. 453, 458, 445 A.2d 343, 345 (1982); <em>Lewis v. Lewis, </em>290 Md. 175, 179, 428 A.2d 454, 456 (1981); <em>Clark v. Elza, </em>286 Md. 208, 211-12, 406 A.2d 922, 924 (1979), quoting <em>Biro v. Schombert, </em>285 Md. 290, 293, 402 A.2d 71, 73 (1979). Judge John C. Eldridge, writing for the Court in <em>Biro, </em>observed that parties cannot confer jurisdiction on our Court, and we must dismiss a case <em>sua sponte </em>on a finding that we do not have jurisdiction:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b268-6\">The apparent acquiescence of the parties to the exercise of appellate jurisdiction by the Court of Special Appeals does not enable us to overlook the matter. As we stated in <em>Eastgate Associates v. Apper, </em>276 Md. 698, 700-701, 350 A.2d 661 (1976): \u201cThe jurisdiction of this Court, and the Court of Special Appeals, is determined by constitutional provisions, statutory provisions and rules; jurisdiction cannot be conferred by consent of the parties.\u201d Consequently, \u201cthis Court will dismiss an appeal <em>sua sponte </em>when it notices that appellate jurisdiction is lacking.\u201d <em>Smith v. Taylor, </em>285 Md. 143, 400 A.2d 1130 (1979). <em>See </em>Rule 835 a 1. Similarly, where the Court of Special Appeals has entertained an appeal without having jurisdiction to do so, and the case is timely brought to our attention (such as by a petition for a writ of certiorari dealing with the merits of the appeal), we will issue a writ of certiorari and <em>sua sponte </em>consider the jurisdiction of the intermediate appellate court. <em>Eastgate </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number><em>Associates v. Apper, supra. See also Liberty Mut. Ins. Co. v. Wetzel, </em>424 U.S. 737, 740, 96 S.Ct. 1202, 1204, 47 L.Ed.2d 435 (1976) (\u201cThough neither party has questioned the jurisdiction of the Court of Appeals to entertain the appeal, we are obligated to do so on our own motion if a question thereto exists.\u201d).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b269-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 293, 402 A.2d at 73. In this regard, we may generally exercise jurisdiction over a case on appeal if there exists a final judgment, which disposes of all claims against all parties and concludes the case. <em>See Nnoli v. Nnoli, </em>389 Md. 315, 323, 884 A.2d 1215, 1219 (2005) (\u201cThe general rule as to appeals is that, subject to a few, limited exceptions, a party may appeal only from a final judgment.\u201d).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> We have often stated that appeals may be taken to the Court of Special Appeals under Section 12-301 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article (1974, 2006 RepLVol.),<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> with exceptions not relevant here, only from a final judgment entered in a civil or criminal case by a circuit court. <em>See Addison v. Lochearn, </em>411 Md. 251, 261, 983 A.2d 138, 144 (2009); <em>Gruber v. Gruber, </em>369 Md. 540, 546, 801 A.2d 1013, 1016 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b269-6\">A \u201cfinal judgment\u201d is defined in Section 12\u2014101(f) of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article as \u201ca judgment, decree, sentence, order, determination, decision, or other action by a court ... from which an appeal ... may be taken.\u201d <em>See Anthony v. Clark, </em>335 Md. 579, 587, 644 A.2d 1070, 1074 (1994). \u201cThe final judgment rule derives originally from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>English common law principle that a writ of error ordinarily would not lie until there had been a final disposition of an entire controversy.\u201d <em>Brewster v. Woodhaven Bldg. &amp; Dev., </em>360 Md. 602, 609-10, 759 A.2d 738, 742 (2000) (citations and footnote omitted) (\u201cThe core of the final judgment rule is thus that a trial court\u2019s decision disposing of the merits of the parties\u2019 claims may be appealed.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b270-4\">Our \u201cbedrock\u201d principles of jurisdiction indicate that, ordinarily, appellate jurisdiction is dependent upon \u201cthe entry of a final judgment, disposing of all claims against all parties,\u201d with limited exceptions. <em>See Kennedy v. Lasting Paints, Inc., </em>404 Md. 427, 449, 947 A.2d 503, 516 (2008), citing <em>Smith v. Lead Indus. </em>Assoc., <em>Inc., </em>386 Md. 12, 21, 871 A.2d 545, 550 (2005), quoting <em>Shoemaker v. Smith, </em>353 Md. 143, 165, 725 A.2d 549, 560 (1999); <em>see also Silbersack v. AC and S, Inc., </em>402 Md. 673, 678, 938 A.2d 855, 857-58 (2008); Rule 2-602(a).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> In <em>Silbersack, </em>we discussed our \u201cbedrock\u201d principles of appellate jurisdiction:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b270-5\">To set the context, there is a long-standing bedrock rule of appellate jurisdiction, practice, and procedure that, unless otherwise provided by law, the right to seek appellate review in this Court or the Court of Special Appeals ordinarily must await the entry of a final judgment that disposes of all claims against all parties.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b270-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 678, 938 A.2d at 858 (citations omitted). To qualify as a final judgment, an order \u201cmust either decide and conclude the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>rights of the parties involved or deny a party the means to prosecute or defend rights and interests in the subject matter of the proceeding,\u201d <em>Nnoli, </em>389 Md. at 324, 884 A.2d at 1219-20, and must, ordinarily, satisfy three criteria:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b271-4\">(1) [I]t must be intended by the court as an unqualified, final disposition of the matter in controversy, (2) unless the court properly acts pursuant to Md. Rule 2-602(b), it must adjudicate or complete the adjudication of all claims against all parties, and (3) the clerk must make a proper record of it in accordance with Md. Rule 2-601.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b271-5\"><em>Rohrbeck v. Rohrbeck, </em>318 Md. 28, 41, 566 A.2d 767, 773 (1989). In considering whether a particular court order or ruling constitutes a final, appealable judgment, we have looked to whether the order was \u201cunqualified,\u201d and whether there was \u201cany contemplation that a further order [was to] be issued or that anything more [was to] be done.\u201d <em>Rohrbeck, </em>318 Md. at 41-42, 566 A.2d at 774 (citations omitted) (alterations in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b271-6\">It is clear that when there is a disposition of all claims against all parties, there is a final judgment. We have held that an unqualified order granting a motion to dismiss or to strike a plaintiffs entire initial pleading, without granting leave to amend, absent counterclaims, cross-claims, or third-party claims, puts the plaintiffs out of court, and terminates the particular action in the trial court, is final and appealable. <em>See Houghton v. County Comm\u2019rs of Kent County, </em>305 Md. 407, 412, 504 A.2d 1145, 1148 (1986), <em>aff'd upon reconsideration, </em>307 Md. 216, 221, 513 A.2d 291, 293-94 (1986) (citations omitted). <em>See also Moore v. Pomory, </em>329 Md. 428, 432, 620 A.2d 323, 325 (1993) (holding that a court\u2019s dismissal of a plaintiffs entire complaint without prejudice was a final and appealable judgment). In <em>Houghton, </em>Edward and Elizabeth Houghton filed a three count complaint in the Circuit Court for Kent County against the County Commissioners, alleging questionable conduct regarding voting in connection with a particular public project. The Commissioners filed a Motion to Dismiss the complaint, which the Circuit Court granted with regard to Counts I and III for failure to state a claim <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>upon which relief could be granted, but denied Count II.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Two days later, the plaintiffs filed a notice voluntarily dismissing Count II of their complaint with prejudice, which was entered on the docket the same day; we held that as of the day Count II was dismissed with prejudice, there was a final disposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-4\">The rub comes, however, because of the complexity of our modern practice of pleading. We already have noted that our long held belief that a judgment which \u201cdecides or settles the \u2018very matter in controversy between the parties\u2019 and determines \u2018the question of right in issue in the cause\u2019 \u201d is a final judgment, and \u201cworks well enough in a simple lawsuit in which a single plaintiff sues a single defendant on a single claim,\u201d does not function easily in our modern system of pleading, in which liberal joinder of parties, cross-claims, and counterclaims may be disposed of at various stages of litigation. <em>Planning Bd. of Howard County v. Mortimer, </em>310 Md. 639, 644-45, 530 A.2d 1237, 1240 (1987), quoting <em>Nally v. Long, </em>56 Md. 567, 571 (1881).</p>\n<p id=\"b272-5\">Although we have held that an order or other form of decision that adjudicates less than the entire claim, or adjudicates the rights and liabilities of fewer than all parties to the action, is not a final judgment, utilization of Rule 2-602(b),<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> regarding certification by a trial court of a final judgment, has occupied much of our efforts in recent years. The Rule allows a party to appeal from a judgment not disposing of an entire action, and one that is not otherwise a final judgment, if a court expressly determines in a written order that there is no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>just reason for delay and directs the entry of a final judgment as to one or more but fewer than all of the claims or parties. We have noted, however, that while Rule 2\u2014602(b) affords a judge limited discretion to enter final judgment when fewer than all parties or claims have been adjudicated, it does not create some kind of \u201cmystic \u2018never-never land\u2019 \u201d where a defendant can be both in and not in a case. <em>Silbersack, 402 </em>Md. at 687, 938 A.2d at 863.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-4\">In <em>Smith, </em>386 Md. at 12, 871 A.2d at 545, we emphasized that Rule 2-602(b) is reserved for the \u201cinfrequent harsh case,\u201d and we will not hesitate to countermand the entry of judgment under the Rule and dismiss an appeal upon a finding that the trial court did not articulate a sufficient reason why there was no just reason for delay of an appeal. <em>Id. </em>at 24-25, 871 A.2d at 552, quoting <em>Diener Enters. v. Miller, </em>266 Md. 551, 555-56, 295 A.2d 470, 473 (1972). <em>Smith </em>was a complex case involving seven minor plaintiffs from four families (the Smiths, the Brantleys, the Hamiltons, and the Shorters) who jointly filed a fifteen-count complaint against twenty-one defendant companies for various products liability-related claims in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City. Early in the Circuit Court proceedings, the judge denied the plaintiff families\u2019 motion to sever the action into four separate cases, one for each family, which would have allowed them to dismiss the action without prejudice and bring separate actions. Instead, the Circuit Court set four separate trial dates, but maintained the action as one unit. A \u201cblizzard\u201d of motions to dismiss and for summary judgment followed, which were granted, in whole or in part, as to various counts and defendants. On appeal, the Court of Special Appeals recognized there was no final judgment in the case because many of the counts against many of the defendants were still unresolved, but that all claims against all defendants had been finally resolved with respect to the Smith family, and concluded, as a result, that \u201cto condition the Smith appeal upon the entry of final judgment in the claims brought by the other plaintiffs would be inefficient, at best, and possibly foolish,\u201d <em>Smith, </em>386 Md. at 20, 871 A.2d at 549, and purported to enter final judgment on the Smith claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>We granted certiorari, but ultimately dismissed the appeal because there was no final, appealable judgment. We held that no final judgment could be certified, because all claims by the Smith family against all of the defendants had not been resolved. There had been an automatic stay that accompanied the filing for bankruptcy protection by Lead Industries Association, Inc., a trade organization defendant; without severing LIA as a defendant, the Circuit Court could not have entered a final judgment under Rule 2-602(b), because \u201cthat would have amounted to splitting a single claim, which is not allowed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 23, 871 A.2d at 551. We held, as a result, that the Court of Special Appeals abused its discretion by entering final judgment under Rule 8-602(e)<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> and that discretion to allow an appeal by entering a final judgment as to less than all of the claims or parties \u201cwas to be reserved for the \u2018very infrequent case.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 24, 871 A.2d at 552, quoting <em>Diener, </em>266 Md. at 555-56, 295 A.2d at 473.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-4\">In <em>Mortimer, </em>310 Md. at 639, 530 A.2d at 1237, we dismissed two consolidated appeals for lack of jurisdiction, because the trial court, in one appeal, had failed to certify an order under Rule 2-602, and in the other appeal, certified a non-certifiable order. In the first appeal, the dismissal of a defendant was arguably final in the traditional sense because it was an unqualified order granting a motion to dismiss, which put the parties out of court and dealt with a single claim, but was not, in fact, final because there were multiple parties involved and a second defendant remained. We held that absent certification pursuant to Rule 2-602(b), there was no final judgment because the order adjudicated the rights and liabilities of fewer than all the parties to the action. <em>Id. </em>at 651-53, 530 A.2d at 1243-44. In the second appeal, we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>addressed the denial of a motion to dismiss a party and held that it was not a final judgment because it was not an order that settled the matter in controversy or completely adjudicated the rights and liabilities of the parties. Because it maintained the status quo and did not display the characteristics of finality, it was not certifiable under Rule 2-602(b). <em>Id. </em>at 653-55, 530 A.2d at 1244-45.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-4\">Recently, in <em>Addison v.

In the case sub judice, the Circuit Court\u2019s dismissal of Count II of the Complaint did not constitute a final, appealable judgment, because Counts I, III, and IV of the Complaint, and the Counterclaim remained. We know from <em>Smith </em>and Addison, supra, that the trial court could not have certified its partial dismissal as a final judgment, because the remaining counts and the counterclaim involved the same set of facts, within the meaning of Rule 2-602(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">The parties, nevertheless, then attempted to circumvent the final judgment rule and attempted to utilize Rules 2-506<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>2-601<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> to file a Stipulation of Dismissal, which dismissed Counts I and III of the Complaint \u201cwith prejudice,\u201d and attempted to also dismiss Count IV and the Counterclaim \u201cwith prejudice,\u201d with the caveat that the dismissal of these claims were \u201cwithout prejudice to the extent that the Court\u2019s earlier interlocutory Opinion and Order dismissing Count II, is vacated or reversed on appeal and remanded to this Court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b278-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>Casey argues before us that the stipulated dismissal of Count IV and the Counterclaim following the Circuit Court\u2019s dismissal of Count II, really constitutes a dismissal with prejudice of all claims and constitutes a final judgment. Casey contends \u201cthere can be no concern whatsoever about piecemeal litigation, inconsistent rulings, advisory opinions or judicial economy,\u201d because, Casey argues, Count IV cannot be revived unless the dismissal of Count II is vacated and the case remanded to the Circuit Court. Rather than circumventing or flouting the final judgment rule, Casey contends the stipulation avoided the \u201cwasteful process\u201d of proceeding to discovery and trial on Counts I and III solely to \u201cpreserve its claim against the guarantor\u201d in Count IV. Conversely, Miller and Smith before us argues there was no final judgment in the Circuit Court because the stipulation of dismissal was \u201cwithout prejudice,\u201d as to Count IV and the Counterclaim, even though it contends we should reach the merits of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-5\">To paraphrase writer Gertrude Stein, \u201cwithout prejudice is without prejudice is without prejudice.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Despite Casey\u2019s vehemence that the parties\u2019 Stipulation of Dismissal was \u201cwith prejudice\u201d and created a final judgment, we disagree. The \u201cwithout prejudice\u201d exception of the Stipulation, no matter how narrow, still created an exception that attempted to confer appellate jurisdiction\u2014an action that could not have been the subject of a certification order. The parties could not agree to confer appellate jurisdiction after the dismissal of Count II of the complaint when they created a dismissal \u2022without prejudice of Count IV and the Counterclaim, and when both were inexorably intertwined with Count II.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-6\">In so holding, our disagreement is with the Court of Special Appeals and with its emphasis on the parties\u2019 intent to determine whether a final judgment existed. In reaching the merits, the Court of Special Appeals stated that it did \u201cnot perceive the parties\u2019 Stipulation of Dismissal to flout the final <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>judgment rule, despite its caveat that appellee\u2019s counterclaim and \u2018Count IV\u2019 of appellant\u2019s complaint were dismissed without prejudice to the extent that we vacate or reverse,\u201d claiming that the admonition against circumventing the final judgment rule would require an intent analysis, relying on <em>Collins v. Li, </em>158 Md.App. 252, 273-74, 857 A.2d 135, 148 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b279-4\">In <em>Collins, </em>158 Md.App. at 252, 857 A.2d at 135, the case arose out of several claims and counterclaims between three plaintiffs and twelve defendants. The original plaintiffs included two sets of parents, individually and as Personal Representatives, to their respective two children who died in a residential fire at a home rented by Michael Chapman and Carolyn Hill (\u201cthe Chapman-Hills\u201d). There were ten defendants in the original complaint, one of which included Dr. Gui-Fu Li and Chung Ling Li (\u201cthe Lis\u201d), as owners of the home. A later complaint was filed by the Chapman-Hills, individually and as Legal Guardians of their three children, one of whom was severely injured in the fire, against the original defendants and two others. Amidst a flurry of motions and counterclaims, the court consented to the dismissal, without prejudice, of all claims between the Chapman-Hills and Lis, and also granted several motions to dismiss, or in the alternative, for summary judgment, in favor of two defendants, The Ry-land Group, Inc., and Summit Electric Company. The court, thereafter, denied the Chapman-Hill\u2019s motion to certify the orders of dismissal as a final judgment under Rule 2-602(b)(l), and the Chapman-Hill\u2019s appealed. Ryland cross-appealed raising the question of whether the Circuit Court erred in consenting to the dismissal without prejudice in order to obtain a final judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-5\">On appeal, the Court of Special Appeals noted the plaintiffs\u2019 clear intent to revive their previously dismissed claims against the voluntarily dismissed defendants after the ruling on appeal, and stated that \u201c[t]he final judgment rule cannot be circumvented by voluntary dismissal pursuant to Rule 2-506.\u201d <em>Collins, </em>158 Md.App. at 273-74, 857 A.2d at 148. The Court reasoned that the \u201cvoluntary dismissal exception\u201d would quickly subsume the rule, if it were to provide a mechanism for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>securing appellate review of any trial court order, and the appellate courts \u201cwould be left without any meaningful way to regulate interlocutory appeals.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 273, 857 A.2d at 147 (citations and quotations omitted). The Court concluded that the plaintiffs\u2019 actions in dismissing the remaining defendants without prejudice gave them the option to resurrect their dismissed claims and was held to be an impermissible attempt to circumvent the final judgment rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-4\">Circumvent has several definitions including, \u201cto go around: make a full circuit around or bypass without going through\u201d and \u201cto overcome or avoid the intent, effect, or force of: anticipate and escape, check, or defeat by ingenuity or stratagem.\u201d Webster\u2019s Third Int\u2019l Dictionary Unabridged 410 (2002). The Court of Special Appeals in the present case misconstrued the use of the word \u201ccircumvent\u201d in <em>Collins </em>to permit a without prejudice stipulation to constitute a final judgment because the parties did not intend to flout the final judgment rule, thereby inferring that the word circumvent requires bad intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-5\">A party or a court cannot intentionally or unintentionally determine that a conditional stipulation or order, respectively, is a final judgment for purposes of conferring appellate jurisdiction. By engaging in an intent analysis, the Court of Special Appeals attempted to give more power to the parties to determine finality than we have given to the judiciary, a result which would be anomalous.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> As Judge Irma S. Raker <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>stated in <em>Brewster, </em>360 Md. at 623, 759 A.2d at 749, \u201c[T]here exists one principle of appealability to which this Court has continuously adhered, one that is simple and understandable. An order which terminates the proceeding in a particular court is final and appealable.\u201d Here, neither the Circuit Court judge\u2019s dismissal of Count II, nor the parties\u2019 Stipulation of Dismissal of Count IV and the Counterclaim without prejudice, created a final, appealable judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-4\">JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS VACATED, AND CASE REMANDED TO THAT COURT WITH INSTRUCTIONS TO DISMISS THE APPEAL.
