We hold that the automatic revocation provision of ET Section 4-105(4) is not limited to bequests to a former spouse, and may include bequests to a former spouse\u2019s family members. A court should utilize the terms of the will and circumstances surrounding its execution to determine whether a bequest \u201crelat[es] to the spouse\u201d within the meaning of Section 4-105(4),</p>\n<p id=\"b360-8\">On appeal de novo from the Orphans\u2019 Court for Baltimore City, the Circuit Court for Baltimore City was called upon to construe the will of James Patrick Hannan (\u201cDecedent\u201d). The Decedent was married at the time he executed the will, but was divorced before his death. There is no dispute that after the divorce, all testamentary bequests made to Decedent\u2019s former spouse were revoked by operation of ET Section 4-105(4). The question at issue involves the status of Decedent\u2019s bequests to \u201cthose surv[iv]ing immediate family members of my Wife[.]\u201d The former spouse\u2019s immediate family members, (Lydia Friedman, Patricia Tolley, Barbara Graves, Genia Covert, Kelley Gallagher and Kimberly Shik\u00e9 [collectively, \u201cFriedman\u201d]) appealed from the trial court\u2019s decision that the marital dissolution revoked their legacies. The Court of Specials (\u201cCSA\u201d) affirmed, and we, in turn, affirm the intermediate appellate court.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-9\">FACTS &amp; LEGAL PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b360-10\">The facts in this case are simple and uncontested. On June 5, 1981, James Hannan married Anna Zelinski.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> No children <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>were born to them during the marriage. At some point, the two separated, and later divorced on February 6, 2001. As part of the separation, both parties entered into a property settlement agreement. Zelinski testified that Decedent met all of his obligations under that agreement.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Decedent subsequently died on September 10, 2006. He had never remarried.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-5\">This action involves a will that Decedent executed during his marriage to Zelinski (\u201cthe Will\u201d),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the relevant provisions of which state:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b361-6\"><em>ITEM TWO: </em>I appoint as Executor of this, my Last Will and Testament, provided she shall survive me, my Wife, ANNA MARIE COVERT HANNAN. In the event my Wife preceedes [sic] me in death, I appoint my Brother, KEVIN HANNAN as Executor of this Will.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b361-7\"><em>ITEM THREE: </em>I give and bequeath to my Wife, ANNA MARIE COVERT HANNAN, provided she survives me, all of my possessions....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b361-8\"><em>ITEM FOUR: </em>Should my Wife, ANNA MARIE COVERT HANNAN, and myself die together by accident or otherwise, the estate is to be handled by LYDIA ELIZABETH COVERT FRIEDMAN and KEVIN HANNAN. All real and personal property, except jewelry belonging to my Wife and myself, be liquidated and proceeds there of [sic] be divided equally between my surviving immediate family members and those surving [sic] immediate family members of my Wife: JEROME B. HANNAN, KEVIN HANNAN, MICHAEL HANNAN, KATHLEEN HANNAN and DANIEL HANNAN, LYDIA ELIZABETH COVERT FRIEDMAN, PATRICIA JO COVERT TOLLEY, BARBARA <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>JANE COVERT, GENIA LOUISE COVERT, and KELLEY ANN FRIEDMAN (said KELLEY is to share her part with her sister KIMBERLY BETH FRIEDMAN). <em>ITEM FIVE: </em>Jewelry belonging to myself shall be given to my Wife if she survives me. If she has preceeded [sic] me in death, it shall go to my brother DANIEL HANNAN, to do with as he wishes. Jewelry belonging to my Wife, is addressed in her own Will.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b362-5\">Both parties assume that the Decedent drafted the Will himself, without the aid of legal counsel, although no evidence was presented to confirm that conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-6\">Decedent\u2019s brother, Jerome B. Hannan (\u201cHannan\u201d) filed the Will with the Register of Wills, and he was appointed personal representative of the estate.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> On May 16, 2007, the Orphans\u2019 Court for Baltimore City concluded that \u201c[t]he remaining clause [in Item Four] pertaining to distribution provides that certain family members, including [Friedman], are entitled to distribution only if the Decedent died in a common disaster with his wife[.]\u201d Accordingly, the Orphans\u2019 Court ordered that the Will not be admitted to probate, effectively leaving Decedent intestate.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-7\">Both parties appealed to the Circuit Court, seeking an interpretation of Item Four as a residuary clause and a determination as to whether Zelinski\u2019s named family members would inherit under that clause. At trial, Zelinski testified that her named family members were her sisters and two of her nieces. She admitted that Decedent did not know her named family members prior to their marriage, and that those family members did not live with them during the marriage. Decedent\u2019s divorce attorney, Susan Huesman-Mitchell, testified that Decedent was a merchant marine, an avocation that required him to live away from his wife on a boat for several weeks at a time.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>The Circuit Court agreed with the parties\u2019 interpretation of Item Four as a residuary clause, and therefore found that Decedent died testate. The court then considered the Will as a whole and determined that its provisions relating to the immediate family of Decedent\u2019s wife could not be fulfilled because of the divorce. The court issued a written order, ordering that \u201conly the immediate family members of the deceased ... receive the proceeds from the estate[,]\u201d and that Friedman \u201cbe excluded from receiving any proceeds of the estate.\u201d The Court of Special Appeals affirmed in an unreported opinion, and Friedman filed a Petition for Writ of Certiorari to this Court. We granted certiorari to consider the following three questions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b363-4\">1. Did the trial court err in deciding that the bequests to Friedman were conditioned on Decedent being married to Zelinski at the time of Decedent\u2019s death?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b363-5\">2. Did the trial court err in deciding that the bequests to Friedman were class gifts and not individual gifts even though the beneficiaries were individually named in the will?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b363-6\">3. Did the trial court err in deciding that ET Section 4-105(4) acts to revoke a person\u2019s testamentary gifts to his former spouse\u2019s specifically identified family members when his will was executed during his marriage and unchanged after his divorce?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b363-7\">We hold there was no error, and affirm the Circuit Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-8\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b363-9\">Pursuant to Maryland Rule 8-131(c), where, as here, an action has been tried without a jury, the appellate court will review the case on both the law and the evidence. \u201cIt will not set aside the judgment of the trial court on the evidence unless clearly erroneous[.]\u201d Md. Rule 8-131(c). \u201cThe appellate court must consider evidence produced at the trial in a light most favorable to the prevailing party[.]\u201d <em>Ryan v. Thurston, </em>276 Md. 390, 392, 347 A.2d 834, 835 (1975). \u201cIf there is any competent evidence to support the factual find<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>ings below, those findings cannot be held to be clearly erroneous.\u201d <em>Solomon v. Solomon, </em>383 Md. 176, 202, 857 A.2d 1109, 1123 (2004) (citation omitted). The trial court\u2019s conclusions of law, however, are not entitled to the deference of the clearly erroneous standard. <em>See Clancy v. King, </em>405 Md. 541, 554, 954 A.2d 1092, 1099 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b364-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b364-6\">Neither party argues that the Will is invalid or should not be admitted to probate. Moreover, the parties agree that Item Four of the Will functions both as a simultaneous death clause and a residuary clause in the event that Decedent\u2019s wife predeceased him. The dispute is whether the bequest to Friedman in Item Four of the Will survived the divorce of Decedent and ZelinsM.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-7\">Friedman contends that in Item Four Decedent crafted individual bequests with the intent that those gifts survive any divorce between Decedent and ZelinsM. Hannan responds that the bequest to Friedman was contingent upon Decedent being married to ZelinsM at the time of his death. Hannan views the bequest as one intended to be a gift to a class, which fails because of the divorce. They also differ on the meaning of ET Section 4-105, with Friedman arguing for a narrow interpretation, and Hannan urging the opposite.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-8\">The starting point of our analysis will be ET Section 4-105, which sets forth the methods or circumstances under which a will may be revoked. Subsection (4) thereof includes divorce as a cause of dissolution to this extent:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b364-9\"><em>Divorce or </em>annulment.\u2014By an absolute divorce of a testator and his spouse or the annulment of the marriage, either of which occurs subsequent to the execution of the testator\u2019s will; <em>and all provisions in the will relating to the spouse, and only those provisions, </em>shall be revoked unless otherwise provided in the will or decree.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b365-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>(Emphasis added).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Both parties agree that the statute applies, and that the case turns on the meaning of \u201crelating to the spouse[.]\u201d Although neither party contends that this provision is ambiguous, they divide on its meaning. Hannan argues that the phrase \u201cprovisions in the will relating to the spouse\u201d mandates revocation when, in the mind of the testator, the connection between the legatees and the ex-spouse is \u201csubstantial and logical\u201d and that there is \u201cno other basis for a connection^]\u201d Friedman, on the other hand, advances a narrow interpretation, which would apply only to bequests to or for the direct benefit of the spouse.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-5\">Maryland has consistently recognized these guiding principles of statutory interpretation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b365-6\">In statutory interpretation, our primary goal is always to discern the legislative purpose, the ends to be accomplished, or the evils to be remedied by a particular provision, be it statutory, constitutional, or part of the Rules. We begin our analysis by first looking to the normal, plain meaning of the language of the statute, reading the statute as a whole to ensure that no word, clause, sentence or phrase is rendered surplusage, superfluous, meaningless or nugatory. If the language of the statute is clear and unambiguous, we need not look beyond the statute\u2019s provisions, and our analysis ends. If, however, the language is subject to more than one interpretation, or when the language is not clear when it is part of a larger statutory scheme, it is ambiguous, and we endeavor to resolve that ambiguity by looking to the statute\u2019s legislative history, case law, and statutory purpose, as well as the structure of the statute.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b366-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number><em>People\u2019s Ins. Counsel Div. v. Allstate Ins. Co., </em>408 Md. 336, 351-52, 969 A.2d 971, 979-80 (2009) (quotation marks and citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b366-5\">Following these principles, we start by considering the plain meaning of \u201crelate,\u201d which is \u201c[t]o stand in some relation; to have bearing or concern; to pertain; refer; to bring into association with or connection with; with \u2018to.\u2019 \u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 1288 (6th ed. 1990); <em>see also Morales v. Trans World Airlines, </em>504 U.S. 374, 383, 112 S.Ct. 2031, 2037, 119 L.Ed.2d 157 (1992) (using the Black\u2019s Law definition of \u201crelate\u201d to interpret the Airline Deregulation Act of 1978 which preempted States from enforcing any law \u201crelating to rates, routes, or services\u201d of any air carrier). Thus, the ordinary meaning of \u201crelate\u201d is the existence of a connection between two subjects, not that the two subjects need be the same. <em>See State v. Harrell, </em>348 Md. 69, 81-82, 702 A.2d 723, 729 (1997) (stating that in order to qualify under the excited utterance exception to the hearsay rule, the \u201cdeclarant\u2019s statement must have <em>some connection </em>with the startling event in order <em>to relate </em>to the startling event ....\u201d) (emphasis added); <em>Trimble v. BNSF Ry. Co., </em>636 F.Supp.2d 916, 922 (D.Neb.2009) (stating that the definition of \u201crelating to\u201d was not so narrow as to require that two subjects be identical); <em>Contractors Ass\u2019n v. West Va. Dep\u2019t of Pub. Safety, Div. of Pub. Safety, </em>et. al., 189 W.Va. 685, 434 S.E.2d 357, 369 (1993) (services provided by Department of Public Safety for road patrol, traffic control, etc. were \u201crelating to\u201d the duties of the Division of Motor Vehicles because \u201cthe activities of one [agency] ha[d] a bearing on the activities of the other.\u201d). Courts have generally treated this language as broadly inclusive. <em>See Se. Ala. Med. Ctr. v. Sebelius, </em>572 F.3d 912, 917 (D.C.Cir.2009) (holding that \u201cfringe benefits\u2014which are part of the compensation an employee receives for his or her services\u2014fit comfortably within the broad meaning of the term \u2018wage-related.\u2019 \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b366-6\">Like the courts in the cases cited above, we read \u201crelating to\u201d as a broad term, and hold that the trier of fact, when applying the statutory language of section 4-105(4) to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>decide whether a particular bequest is one \u201crelating to the spouse,\u201d is not limited to bequests to or for the benefit of the spouse. In other words, the trier of fact may determine that bequests to other persons nonetheless \u201crelate to\u201d the spouse. We draw this conclusion because the term \u201crelating to\u201d means that \u201cthere is a connection between two subjects, not that the subjects have to be the same.\u201d <em>Trimble, </em>636 F.Supp.2d at 922. Fundamental principles of statutory construction require that we must take care to \u201censure that no word, clause, sentence or phrase\u201d is rendered surplusage by our interpretation. <em>People\u2019s Ins. Counsel Div., </em>408 Md. at 351-52, 969 A.2d 971. If the General Assembly had intended Section 4-105(4) to apply more narrowly, it had no reason to use the term \u201crelating to.\u201d It could have simply said that upon divorce, \u201call provisions in the will for the former spouse are revoked.\u201d Its choice not to do this, but instead to use the broader \u201crelating to\u201d language, must be respected and enforced by this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-5\">We are not persuaded by Friedman\u2019s argument that \u201c[t]he deliberate inclusion of \u2018and only those provisions\u2019 is clear evidence that the legislature intended to limit the scope of [ET Section 4-105(4)] to revoke only those provisions relating to the former spouse.\u201d This language simply clarifies that the balance of the will remains intact. It adds nothing that would further define or limit the meaning of the phrase \u201crelating to the spouse.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b367-6\">With such a broadly worded statute, the task of determining, on a case by case basis, whether a particular bequest in a will was \u201crelated to\u201d the decedent\u2019s former spouse, falls to the courts. This decision is made largely by the trial court because it involves a fact-based inquiry, i.e., determination of the decedent\u2019s intent. When construing a will, the \u201cparamount concern of the court is to ascertain and effectuate the testator\u2019s expressed intent.\u201d <em>Pfeufer v. Cyphers, </em>397 Md. 643, 649, 919 A.2d 641, 645 (2007) (quotation marks and citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b367-7\">Generally, that intent is \u201cgathered from the four corners of the will, with the words of the will given their \u2018plain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>meaning and import.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>Where, as here, \u201ca will is drawn by a layman, the language used may be given the meaning it would commonly have to a person in his situation!)]\u201d <em>Shriner\u2019s Hosps. v. Maryland Nat\u2019l Bank, </em>270 Md. 564, 570, 312 A.2d 546, 550 (1973) (citations omitted). Ordinarily, extrinsic evidence is not admissible to prove the testator\u2019s intent unless there is a latent ambiguity. <em>See Monmonier v. Monmonier, </em>258 Md. 387, 390, 266 A.2d 17, 19 (1970). Yet, when ascertaining that intent, the court may consider \u201cthe situation of the testator and his relations with the parties to whom he has devised or bequeathed his property!)]\u201d <em>Robinson v. Mercantile Trust Co. of Baltimore, </em>180 Md. 336, 339, 24 A.2d 299, 300 (1942). In that regard, the will must be \u201cread in the light of the surrounding circumstances existing at the time of its execution.\u201d <em>Hebden v. Keim, </em>196 Md. 45, 48, 75 A.2d 126, 128 (1950).</p>\n<p id=\"b368-5\">As the trial court in this case pronounced, \u201cthe duty to ascertain and effectuate a testator\u2019s intention is virtually ironclad.\u201d Adhering to that rule, the Circuit Court determined that Decedent intended to create two classes of legatees: (1) Decedent\u2019s surviving immediate family members, and (2) those surviving immediate family members of his wife. It concluded that because the bequest to his spouse\u2019s relatives was conditioned on him being married at his death, the bequest to the second class failed. Our task is to decide whether the Circuit Court\u2019s fact findings were clearly erroneous, or it made an error of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-6\">The Circuit Court\u2019s decision and Friedman\u2019s criticism of it can best be understood if we set forth the key portions in the language of the Court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b368-7\">Looking at the will itself, taking the decedent\u2019s wife out of the will, it is clear that the testator intended to create two classes of persons to share equally in the proceeds of the estate.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b368-8\">The first class of individuals was the decedent\u2019s immediate family members, comprising of five persons. The second class, or group, consisted of six persons, namely his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>wife\u2019s immediate family members. Persons 5 and 6; namely Kelly Ann Friedman, as well as Kelly Beth Friedman, Kelly was to share her part of the proceeds with her sister, Kimberly Beth Friedman.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-5\">The division here, looking at the four corners of this will, indicates an intent to create the two classes of persons as opposed to individual bequests.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-6\">At the time of his death, the decedent was unmarried. He did not have a wife. Since he did not have a wife, there were no immediate family members of a wife at the time of his death.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-7\">Absent any evidence to the contrary, this was a condition that the decedent\u2014that decedent did not contemplate at the time that he signed the will.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-8\">The condition, namely passing of proceeds to his wife and/or her immediate family members, cannot be fulfilled.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-9\">I find that the case of <em>Herman v. Ortego, </em>39 California App. 4th, 1529 to be particularly instructive in this case. In that case, which is extremely similar to the case at hand, the court indicated the decisive inquiry is whether or not the testator in making the particular gift in question did so with group mindiness.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-10\">Whether, in other words, he was looking at the body of persons in question as a whole or a unit, rather than individual members of the group as individuals, if the former they take as a class.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-11\">According to the holding in that case, the court found that we think it more logical construction to hold that when a testator provides for his spouses\u2019 children, he normally intends to exclude children of an ex-spouse after dissolution unless a contrary intention is indicated elsewhere in the will. We clearly do not have a contrary indication indicated elsewhere in the will.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-12\">And I also find that\u2014that consistent with the out of state opinion, this testator clearly made a gift in terms of group mindiness. And I find that as evidence of six individuals on the immediate\u2014six immediate family members on the wife\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>side have to share in half the estate, but only five members of the decedent\u2019s immediate family have to share in this\u2014 the estate.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b370-4\">Friedman argues that the Circuit Court made an error of law in classifying the Item Four bequest as conditioned on Decedent remaining married to Zelinski at his death. In a related argument, Zelinski contends that \u201cthe court placed the burden on Petitioners to prove that Decedent actually intended what he unambiguously stated in his will rather than on Respondent to prove that he did not.\u201d As these two arguments are intertwined, we address them together.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-5\">The criteria for a class gift were stated in <em>Evans v. Safe Deposit &amp; Trust Co., </em>190 Md. 332, 338, 58 A.2d 649, 652 (1948):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AZL\">a gift of an aggregate sum (1) to a body of persons uncertain in number at the time of the gift, (2) to be ascertained at a future time, and (3) who are all to take in equal or some other definite proportions; the share of each being dependent for its amount upon the ultimate number of persons!.] (citations omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b370-6\"><em>See also Madden v. Mercantile-Safe Deposit &amp; Trust Co., </em>262 Md. 406, 278 A.2d 55 (1971). Friedman argues that the bequest necessarily fails the first criterion for a class gift because (1) there is no way to determine membership for this group without including the names, (2) the \u201cnumber of persons was not uncertain when the will was drafted!,]\u201d and (3) the \u201cnumber of persons could not increase or decrease after the will was drafted.\u201d The legacy also fails the second element, she maintains, because \u201cDecedent\u2019s gifts were to eleven people!,]\u201d a number which was \u201cknown when the will was drafted and [was] not going to change.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b370-7\">We do not consider the traditional criteria for class gifts to be dispositive in this case.. These criteria are no more than an interpretive tool often used by courts when analyzing a will. As Maryland courts have held for more than a century, interpretive tools are ultimately subordinate to a court\u2019s paramount inquiry\u2014the intention of the testator. <em>See, e.g., Evans, </em>190 Md. at 341, 58 A.2d at 653 (canons of construction, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>including those about class gifts, are subordinate to the general rule that the \u201cobvious intent of the testator must prevail\u201d); <em>Judik v. Travers, </em>184 Md. 215, 221, 40 A.2d 306, 309 (1944) (\u201cIt is only when the verbal expressions are of doubtful meaning that the rules or canons of construction may be invoked, and even these rules have no binding force, being mere guides to aid in the discovery of this all important element of intention.\u201d).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> More importantly, we must bear in mind that we are dealing with a statute, ET Section 4-105(4), which automatically operates to revoke certain bequests upon divorce, and the rules of will construction, such as class gifts, must be viewed in that context.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-5\">The trial court did not confine itself to the traditional \u201cclass gift\u201d criteria to construe Decedent\u2019s intent. It focused on the divorce context, and found persuasive the rationale of a California case in which the court had to determine whether the testator intended to create two classes of devisees when he bequeathed his property to \u201cmy children and my spouse\u2019s children who survive me\u201d and \u201cmy issue and my spouse\u2019s issue who survive me[,]\u201d and whether those bequests remained valid <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>following a divorce. <em>See Hermon v. Urteago, </em>39 Cal.App.4th 1525, 46 Cal.Rptr.2d 577, 579 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b372-4\">The California court held that the testator intended to create two groups of legatees because the words \u201cmy spouse\u2019s children\u201d and \u201cmy spouse\u2019s issue\u201d were used without naming any individuals, signaling the testator\u2019s paramount intent to describe the beneficiaries as members of a group identified by familial ties. <em>Id. </em>at 581. In so holding, the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AIY\">The decisive inquiry is whether or not the testator, in making the particular gift in question, did so with \u2018group-mindedness,\u2019 whether, in other words, he was looking to the body of persons in question as a whole or unit rather than to the individual members of the group as individuals; if the former, they take as a class.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b372-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 580.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> This approach to ascertaining intent of the decedent is consistent with Maryland common law, and we do not agree with Friedman\u2019s contention that the Circuit Court erred when it utilized the approach in determining whether the bequest in Item Four was \u201crelated to\u201d the Decedent\u2019s former spouse for purposes of ET Section 4-105(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b372-6\">As we indicated above, a court may consider the relationships between the testator and his beneficiaries when investigating intent. <em>See Robinson, </em>180 Md. at 339, 24 A.2d at 300. Thus, the trial court did not err in considering the tenuous nature of Decedent\u2019s relationship to his spouse\u2019s family in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>concluding that Decedent would not have intended that bequest to survive a divorce. In this vein, there was testimony before the court that indicated that Decedent did not know Zelinski\u2019s family members prior to marrying her, and that during a large portion of the marriage he was employed at sea.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">We are not persuaded by Friedman\u2019s argument that the Circuit Court erroneously reversed the burden of proving that the gift to his wife\u2019s relatives was conditioned on the continuance of the marriage. We interpret ET Section 4-105(4) to be similar to a burden-shifting law. We conclude that in creating the automatic revocation of will provisions \u201crelating to\u201d a former spouse, the General Assembly recognized two pertinent features of divorce. First, divorce usually results in a separation of assets that were jointly owned, thus reducing each spouse\u2019s assets available to bequeath to his or her own family. Second, divorce is often acrimonious, with the acrimony spilling over to the former spouse\u2019s family. Also, it is common in writing wills during a marriage that two spouses divide their assets between their respective family members because they have agreed that is fair. Even without acrimony, this viewpoint is likely to change upon divorce. In enacting Section 4-105(4), the Legislature created a remedy to avoid unintended consequences for people who neglect to change their wills upon divorce.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-6\">For these reasons it is permissible for an Orphans\u2019 Court or circuit court to find that a will provision is \u201crelating to\u201d the former spouse within the meaning of Section 4-105(4) if it considers that the provision was primarily motivated by the marriage or given at the request of the spouse. As we mentioned above, a testator may provide for the children of a spouse simply because each spouse agrees to benefit the other\u2019s family, without any independent desire to devise property to those children.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> On the other hand, a court could find <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>that a bequest did not \u201crelate to\u201d the spouse when the evidence shows that the testator formed a close personal relationship with the legatee and likely desired to provide for him or her regardless of whether the marriage continued.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">Decedent\u2019s naming of the individuals included in the bequest to his wife\u2019s relatives, in addition to referring to them by a group name, does not foreclose a finding that Decedent viewed them as a group of persons who would only inherit if he remained married. <em>See Cryder v. Garrison, </em>387 Pa. 571, 128 A.2d 761, 764 (1957) (holding that a court may find a class gift where class members are individually named in the will when the testator intended to create a class gift). The Circuit Court in this case observed: \u201cThe division here, looking at the four corners of this will, indicates an intent to create the two classes of persons as opposed to individual bequests.\u201d Much of the evidence that the Circuit Court relied on to support the conclusion that Decedent made a bequest with \u201cgroup-mindedness\u201d is found in the text of Item Four itself. Although Decedent individually named each family member who would take pursuant to Item Four, he <em>first </em>identified those people according to their respective groups before listing their names. Additionally, Decedent placed the conjunction \u201cand\u201d before the last person comprising <em>each </em>group, thus suggesting an intent to create two lists, rather than one.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Finally, instead of specifically referring to Zelinski when classifying the Friedman group, Decedent described them as the \u201cimmediate family members of <em>my Wife[.]\u201d </em>(emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b375-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>Petitioner advances an argument based on a comparison of the Uniform Probate Code (\u201cUPC\u201d) and ET Section 4-105(4) and purported legislative history. UPC Section 2-508, in effect in 1969, called for revocation of will provisions \u201cto the spouse.\u201d At the same time, the precursor to Maryland\u2019s ET Section 4-105 contained largely the same language as the statute does today, in that it called for revocation of provisions \u201crelating to the spouse.\u201d <em>See </em>Md.Code (1957), Article 93, \u00a7 351. In 1990, the UPC was amended to add a provision that the automatic revocation upon divorce also applied to any bequests \u201cto a relative of the divorced individual\u2019s former spouse[.]\u201d UPC \u00a7 2-804(b)(l) (1990) Petitioner posits that the</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b375-4\">UPC did in its revision exactly what [Hannan] asks this Court to do\u2014expand the concept of revocation beyond the former spouse to also include the former spouse\u2019s relatives. But Maryland has not adopted this portion of the UPC nor in any way indicated that it wished to expand this statute in such a manner.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b375-5\">In an effort to support her contention that the failure of the Maryland General Assembly to adopt the revised UPC Section 2-804(b)(l) demonstrates it had no intent that Section 4-105(4) would operate to revoke bequests to a former spouse\u2019s relatives, she invokes the Second Report of the Governor\u2019s Commission to Review and Revise the Testamentary Law of Maryland (the \u201cHenderson Commission\u201d) which was issued in 1968.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> She relies on the Commission\u2019s Comment to what was then Section 351 (now Section 4-105) which reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b375-6\">This section adopts, without change or substance, \u00a7 351(Md) which was recently reconsidered and amended by the General Assembly. See the Comment to Section 3-301. The Commission therefore felt that the approach to the subject of 2-506 and 2-507(UPC), which is somewhat more restricted than the present Maryland law, should not be followed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b376-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>Friedman maintains, \u201cThis comment is not only evidence of an awareness of the UPC, but a willingness to vary from its proposed language.\u201d We have no doubt that the Henderson Commission was aware of the UPC, or that it considered itself free of any duty to recommend the UPC provisions to the General Assembly. But we do not agree that the Comment sheds light on the question at hand. In using the phrase \u201csomewhat more restricted,\u201d the Comment refers to UPC Sections 2-506 and 2-507, neither of which addresses revocation by divorce.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Moreover, we see nothing in that Report that reveals a legislative intent that the words \u201crelating to the spouse\u201d in Section 4-105 should be construed narrowly.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b376-6\">In sum, we hold that ET Section 4-105(4) is not limited in its effect to provisions for the direct benefit of the spouse. The decision as to whether a particular provision is one \u201crelating to\u201d a former spouse is a factual one to be made by the trial court. In doing so, a court should decide whether the testator in creating the provision was primarily motivated by the marriage or whether the testator had independent reasons for the bequest. In making that decision, the court may infer that bequests made to a former spouse\u2019s family were made primarily because of the marriage unless there is evidence of some independent reason in the will itself or the circumstances existing at the time of execution. For the reasons set forth above, we conclude that the Circuit Court did not err in finding that Decedent was \u201cgroup-minded\u201d in the Item Four residuary bequest, and that the bequest to Friedman failed as a result of the divorce.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-7\">JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS AFFIRMED.

When first codified in 1957 as Section 351 of Article 93, the statute did not include divorce and annulment as part of its enumerated list of acceptable methods to revoke a will. <em>See </em>Md.Code (1957), Article 93, \u00a7 351. Effective June 1, 1964, however, the General Assembly enacted Chapter 106 of the Acts of 1964, which added a new Section 351(d), expanding that list to include absolute divorce. Although revised slightly since that time and recodified as ET \u00a7 4-105(4), the subsection has remained substantially unchanged (other than the addition of annulment as a catalyst for revocation) since 1964. <em>Compare </em>ET \u00a7 4-105(4) with Mid.Code (1957), Article 93, \u00a7 351(d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b371-6\">. <em>See also, e.g., Johnson v.
