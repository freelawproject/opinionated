These notes were secured by a conditional bill of sale which the Sales Company forthwith assigned to the Colonial Acceptance Corporation together with the notes. This corporation was engaged in the business of financing sales of automobiles for dealers. In connection with this corporation\u2019s operations, the Pacific Fire Insurance Company, hereinafter referred to as the defendant, had issued to it a so-called \u201cmaster policy\u201d of non-valued insurance against fire and theft covering all motor vehicles of which it financed the sale. The Acceptance Corporation agreed to see that all motor vehicles financed by it were insured thereunder. By its terms the policy became operative immediately upon assignment to the Acceptance Corporation of the notes and conditional bill of sale, for the benefit of the seller, the Acceptance Corporation, and the purchaser of the car financed, as their several interests might appear.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-7\">The policy provided that the Acceptance Corporation should furnish the defendant with particulars of insurance as to each motor vehicle financed by it, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>that the defendant should \u201cpromptly cause to be issued a certificate of participation which shall specifically evidence the insurance upon such motor vehicle under the policy.\u201d The defendant furnished to the Acceptance Corporation forms headed, \u201cNotice of Insurance Coverage,\u201d which it in turn made out in quadruplicate upon the purchase of the plaintiffs\u2019 notes from the Sales Company. Two copies it mailed to the defendant and the other two it retained, failing to forward one of these to the plaintiffs, as was its practice. The Acceptance Corporation was authorized by the defendant to issue these notices of insurance coverage which constituted the certificate of participation provided for in the master policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-6\">The printed portion of the third warranty by the assured in the master policy consists of column headings with a blank space beneath each, calling for various descriptive details as to make, model, price, etc., of the cars insured. One of these headings reading \u201cPurchased by Assured\u201d has a subheading, \u201cNew or 2nd Hand.\u201d In the space below these printed words appears the typewritten word \u201cVarious.\u201d Among similarly arranged printed headings calling for descriptive details in the certificate of participation covering the plaintiffs\u2019 car is one reading: \u201cNew or Used.\u201d Under this is the typewritten word \u201cNew.\u201d This was inserted by the Acceptance Corporation, designated in the conditional bill of sale as the plaintiffs\u2019 agent, from a description to that effect in the conditional bill of sale. The car was damaged by fire on January 30th, 1936, in the amount of $1825. The plaintiffs\u2019 demand for the payment of this sum under the policy was denied by the defendant on April 28th, 1936.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-7\">To the plaintiffs\u2019 complaint seeking recovery upon the policy, the defendant interposed a special defense that the Acceptance Corporation in procuring the in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>surance as agent for the plaintiffs, represented the Auburn car which was in fact a \u201cused\u201d car, to be a \u201cnew\u201d car, and that this constituted a material misrepresentation and breach of warranty to the defendant concerning the description of the car, excusing it from liability. In addition to the undisputed facts recited in the three preceding paragraphs the court properly found these further facts. The Sales Company was the distributor of Auburn cars for the State of Connecticut, and the plaintiffs were Auburn dealers for the Waterbury territory. This Auburn car was a special model of which but twenty-six had been manufactured, and could be procured on order only after a period of six months. It was delivered to the Sales Company about the first of May, 1935. It had novel features of construction and design and could attain a speed of one hundred miles per hour. Up to June 8th, 1935, it was driven to various places in the State for purposes of display, was operated by salesmen for demonstration purposes, and by prospective customers, and prior to its sale to the plaintiffs was driven a total of from three to four thousand miles. On June 8th, 1935, it was damaged in a collision to the extent of 8515.65, and in consequence was in the repair shop for two months. Some parts were replaced, others repaired, and the car was repainted, restoring it to perfect condition. Its intrinsic value was then no less than when it was originally delivered to the Sales Company. Minor repairs and adjustments were also made from time to time. Thereafter it was on display in the distributor\u2019s sales room and operated infrequently solely for demonstration purposes until sold to the plaintiffs, September 9th, 1935.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-6\">The court concluded in substance that the words \u201cnew or used\u201d in the certificate of participation were employed synonymously with the words \u201cnew or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>second hand\u201d in the master policy; that the car was not \u201csecond hand\u201d; and that therefore there was no breach of warranty by the plaintiffs. The question determinative of this appeal is whether the court erred in this conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-6\">It is provided in the master policy that the certificate of participation \u201cshall specifically evidence the insurance upon such motor vehicle under this policy, ... on a form furnished by the Company [the defendant], such form of certificate to identify the motor vehicle, shall name the Purchaser and state the purpose for which the motor vehicle is to be used and the sum to be insured thereon.\u201d The certificate of participation after referring specifically to the master policy, goes on to state in what respects and to what extent \u201cthe automobile which is described herein is insured,\u201d and to advise the purchaser (the plaintiffs) that the master policy \u201cis subject to all the terms, conditions, stipulations, provisions, exclusions, warranties and endorsements which appear hereon or attached hereto.\u201d By these provisions these two instruments are integrated together to evidence the contract of insurance sued on.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-7\">The court found that the descriptive word \u201cnew\u201d as applied to automobiles is used in varying meaning among dealers in cars, and that time elapsed since manufacture, extent of use incident to the dealer\u2019s business prior to sale to a customer, accident experience, and the original sale at retail, are each respectively the factor which different dealers regard as determinative whether a car is \u201cnew\u201d within one of these several meanings. It further found that for the purpose of determining the amount of premium to be charged for insurance, a car is \u201cnew\u201d for the eighteen months next after the dealer\u2019s original sale of it to a member of the public, and that the same premium, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>which is at the highest rate, is charged throughout this period without reference to its ownership, extent of use, or accident experience. These findings are supported by the evidence. Since the meaning of the typewritten word \u201cnew\u201d is doubtful, the trial court properly resorted to extrinsic evidence in determining in what sense it was used in this warranty. <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Crockett Co., </em>85 Conn. 282, 288, 82 Atl. 569; <em>Adams </em>v. <em>Turner, </em>73 Conn. 38, 45, 46 Atl. 247; <em>Parker </em>v. <em>Selden, </em>69 Conn. 544, 552, 38 Atl. 212. The construction most favorable to the insured is to be adopted. <em>King </em>v. <em>Travelers Ins. Co., </em>123 Conn. 1, 4, 192 Atl. 311; <em>Standard Fur Cutting Co. </em>v. <em>Caledonian Ins. Co., </em>113 Conn. 108, 113, 154 Atl. 153; <em>Dresser </em>v. <em>Hartford Life Ins. Co., </em>80 Conn. 681, 710, 70 Atl. 39.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-6\">The subheading in the policy \u201cnew or second hand\u201d and the heading in the certificate of participation \u201cnew or used\u201d were apparently intended to cover the same ground. As regards an article purchased in the market, the ordinary meaning of the words \u201csecond hand\u201d is that the article has previously been owned by someone other than the manufacturer or dealer whose business it is to sell such articles to the public. <em>Texas &amp; P. Ry. Co. </em>v. <em>Wilson Hack Line, </em>46 Tex. Civ. App. 38, 40, 101 S. W. 1042. The trial court was warranted in concluding that the words \u201cnew or used\u201d as these appear in the certificate of participation were employed synonymously with the words \u201cnew or second hand\u201d under the warranties in the master policy and as such were designed to elicit information as to whether the car insured was one purchased from the dealer to whom the car was shipped from the factory or from some person who acquired ownership of it after such dealer had sold it. In determining the meaning of terms used in a policy of insurance, \u201cthe settled construction given by the commercial world to stipulations <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>therein may, though differing from the natural import of the words, be sanctioned by the courts.\u201d 1 Couch, Insurance, 366, \u00a7 179. The court\u2019s determination, therefore, that this car never having been sold at retail to a customer, was not a \u201csecond hand\u201d car was correct. From this it follows, as the court further concluded, that the plaintiffs made no untrue statement concerning the car and so did not commit a breach of warranty as claimed by the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-6\">The defendant is entitled to no correction of the finding material to this appeal. Its further claim that the plaintiffs\u2019 recovery of interest should be confined to interest on the difference between its rejected offer of $800 in settlement and the $1850 loss actually sustained by the plaintiffs, not pressed on its brief, is without merit. <em>Bernhard </em>v. <em>Rochester German Ins. Co., </em>79 Conn. 388, 398, 65 Atl. 134. The court\u2019s judgment in this case was not only legally correct but in full accord with the strong equities apparent upon the record. The plaintiffs, in addition to admittedly acting in entire good faith throughout, were not even informed that the Acceptance Company had used the wording complained of, had paid the top premium rate, and were merely claiming the actual value of the property destroyed, the amount of which was not disputed.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-7\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-8\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
