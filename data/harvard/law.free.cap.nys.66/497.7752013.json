The documentary evidence shows conclusively that the plaintiff is the only party in interest. \u00a1Nor is there any weight in the defendant\u2019s claim that he was evicted from the premises. As a matter of fact, he was not either actually or constructively evicted from the premises, or any portion of them. He occupied them, and should pay the rent. It is well settled in this state that the defense of constructive eviction is not available to the tenant without a surrender of the premisesBoreel v. Lawton, 90 N.
