It appears from the return of the marshal, and also, from his affidavit and that of the plaintiff\u2019s attorney, that a copy of the summons was personally served upon the defendant, and, since such fact does not appear to have been traversed, or proof submitted tending to show the contrary, the action of the justice in dismissing the action cannot be upheld.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-5\">The judgment must therefore be reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to the appellant to abide the event.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
