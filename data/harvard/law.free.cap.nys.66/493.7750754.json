J.</author>\n<p id=\"A1GJ\">The defendant, being the landlord of vacant premises on Broadway, in this city, and desiring to rent them, engaged plaintiff, who was a real-estate broker, to procure a tenant. The testimony shows that after such employment he introduced to defendant Messrs. Tivnan &amp; Somers and several other persons who desired to rent said premises; that finally they were rented to one Winfield by defendant. Plaintiff contends that Winfield was the agent of Tivnan <em>&amp; </em>Somers, and we believe .that the jury were justified in so finding, because the testimony showing such a relation is quite strong. It also appears that defendant knew that Winfield represented Tivnan &amp; Somers, and so informed plaintiff, who was not aware of that fact at the time he received such information. The establishment of these facts in plaintiff\u2019s favor justified them in rendering a verdict in plaintiff\u2019s favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-19\">The defendant, upon this appeal, contends that plaintiff cannot recover, because he agreed to accept commission from Tivnan &amp; Somers without defendant\u2019s consent; thus serving two masters. There is no such evidence. All that was shown by defendant upon that point was that Tivnan &amp; Somers, after they had leased, promised plaintiff to pay him his commissions if defendant did not. They never paid <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>them, and could not be compelled to do so by plaintiff, and such agreement surely did not release defendant from his obligation to do so. It was proper to allow the testimony and agreement in evidence, because it proved plaintiff\u2019s assertion that Tivnan &amp; Somers and Win-field held such business relations towards each other as would justify a jury in concluding that he was their business agent.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-5\">The charge of the trial justice, supplemented by those requests submitted by defendant, and which were charged fairly, fully, and squarely, submitted to the jury all the law bearing upon the case. He was, therefore, justified in refusing to charge other requests submitted by defendant. Although such requests are not before us, we must conclude that they required the justice to repeat what he had already charged, or else required him to charge law not applicable to the case,\u2014something he was not compelled to do.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-6\">We find no error. We think the case was fairly tried, and that \u25a0 the verdict was a just one. It is therefore affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-7\">CORLAR, J., concurs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
