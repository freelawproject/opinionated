The preference was claimed under subdivision 5 of section 791 of the Code of Civil Procedure. The motion for a preference was denied upon the ground that the notice claiming the preference was not served with the notice of trial. It is not necessary that the notice of an application for a preference should be attached to, or served at the same time as, the notice of trial. It is sufficient if it be served at any time within which the cause could be noticed for trial. This is what this court held in Gil<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>bert v. Finch, 46 App. Div. 75, 61 N. Y. Supp. 300, and on that authority the order appealed from must be reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and the motion granted, with $10 costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
