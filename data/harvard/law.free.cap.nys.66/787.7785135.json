White for debt. From a judgment for defendant, plaintiff appeals.</summary>\n<disposition data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"disposition\" id=\"ATd\">Reversed.</disposition>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b807-11\">Between April, 1897, and October, 1897, the plaintiff, at the request of the defendant, furnished board for three different men employed by the defendant at an agreed price of $2.50 per week. Upon October 17, 1897, the parties attempted to adjust their accounts. The balance due, as appeared upon the plaintiff\u2019s book, was somewhat in excess of that which appeared upon the defendant\u2019s book. After some discussion, the defendant gave to the plaintiff a check for the balance as appeared to be due upon his own book, the check reciting that it was \u201cin full to date.\u201d At the time of the giving of the check the defendant said to the plaintiff that, if there was any mistake, he would rectify it. This fact is disputed by the defendant, but for the purpose of this appeal must be deemed to have been found, upon sufficient evidence by the justice. The plaintiff swears that he did not notice that the check read \u201cin full to date.\u201d He afterwards cashed the check, and thereafter brought this action for the balance claimed to be due from the defendant. He recovered in justice\u2019s court the sum of about $17. The judgment entered upon this recovery the county court has reversed, and from this reversal this appeal is taken.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b807-12\">Argued before PARKER, P.

Gaillard, 60 N. Y. 614. This case holds that \u201ca party who, upon the receipt of a sum of money, supposing that he is simply receipting therefor, signs, without reading it, a receipt in full of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"788\">*788</page-number>all accounts, is not concluded thereby from recovering any other sum due him.\u201d As no further error is claimed by the respondent to have been made by the justice, we find no sufficient reason for the \u2022 reversal by the county court.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-5\">Judgment of the county court reversed, and that of the justice\u2019s court affirmed, with costs in both courts. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
