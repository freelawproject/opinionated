In view of the nature of the contest between these parties, the doubt existing concerning the true boundary line of their respective properties, and the conflict concerning acquiescence in the acts of the defendant which are made the basis of the plaintiff\u2019s cause of action, we think their rights should not be determined upon affidavits, but only after a full trial of the cause. It may be said, in addition, that it is quite plain that the reinstatement of the temporary injunction vacated by the order appealed from would cause vastly more injury to the defendant than benefit to the plaintiff, and under such circumstances, and in such a case, the general rule referred to in Brower v. Williams, 44 App. Div. 340, 60 N. Y. Supp. 716, applies. In reaching this conclusion we wish it to be distinctly understood that we express no opinion whatever respecting the merits of the case, either as to the disputed questions of fact or the propositions of law involved in the action. The order should be affirmed, with $10 costs and disbursements.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
