Testimony was taken, and the commissioners made their report. On motion the report was confirmed by the county court. An appeal was taken to this court from the order of confirmation. Pending the appeal, this application was made to the county court to compel an amended return by the commissioners touching the evidence taken before them. The county court denied the application.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b263-6\">Argued before PARKER, P.

If the appeal had not removed the -matter beyond the jurisdiction of the county court, it is still an appeal from the judgment of the county court based upon the report of the commissioners and the evidence before the court as returned by the commissioners. To make a different record, with different facts, for this court, is not permissible. That would not, in any sense, be reviewing the county court. The record which comes here must be the exact case considered by the county court.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-10\">The order of the county court is affirmed, with $10 costs and disbursements.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
