Thereafter all the defendants moved for a change of venue to New York county, where all the transactions took place out of which the cause of action arose, and where all the witnesses for both parties who were not nonresidents resided. <em>Weld, </em>that the motion was improperly denied, since the corporation, not being a party to the stipulation (which, moreover, was not made by the other defendants as an intentional waiver of the right to a change of venue), should not be prejudiced thereby.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"history\" id=\"b867-10\">Appeal from special term, Albany county.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b867-11\">Action by Melville A.

The defendant the Distilling Company of America appeared by its attorneys and answered. The other defendants appeared by their attorneys, and, for the purpose of obtaining additional time to answer, entered into a stipulation which expressed this condition: \u201cThat the issue herein shall remain as of original date, and that the plaintiff may at any time after such day of issue serve a notice of trial, and file a note of issue for the special term, of the court for the trial of equity cases, appointed to he held in and for the county of Albany, at the city hall, in the city of Albany, on the 16th day of June, 1900.\u201d These other defendants were the directors and officers of the defendant distilling company. All defendants united in this application to remove the place of trial to the county of New York. It appeared that in that county all the transactions occurred out of which the cause of action has arisen, and substantially all the witnesses for either party live who do not live without the state. The plaintiff claims no witnesses within the county of Albany, and rests his defense to the motion mainly upon the stipulation of the defendants other than the distilling company as a consent to the trial of the action in Albany comity.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b868-4\">Argued before PARKER, P.

If this stipulation had been signed by all of the parties defendant, it would be such a consent on their part as would require the court to retain the place of trial in Albany county. Moreover, if the stipulation on the part of the other defendants than the distilling company had been made as an intentional waiver of the right to change the place of trial, the relation of those defendants to the distilling company is such that the court might well hold the distilling company to the stipulation of its officers, though not made on its behalf. The holding, however, in this case, that such a stipulation is an estoppel against the making of this motion, would be rather technical, and, in our judgment, should not be made, to the injury of the distilling company, not a party to the stipulation. All of the defendants unite in this application. As the estoppel claimed is not broad enough to forbid all the defendants from asking for a change of venue, and as the case seems otherwise to be one clearly calling for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"849\">*849</page-number>such a change, we think the special term erroneously denied the defendants\u2019 motion, and that the action should be tried in the county of New York. The order should therefore be reversed, and defendants\u2019 motion granted, with costs to the appellants to abide the event of the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-5\">Order reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and motion granted, with $10 costs, to abide event. AH concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
