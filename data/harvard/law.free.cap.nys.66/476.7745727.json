We think the law upon this point is established that, as to a purchaser having knowledge of the mortgage lien, even though the instrument be not filed, he is bound, but as to the judgment creditor such mortgage is actually void, notwithstanding he may have had notice of its existence brought home to him. Stephens v. Perrine, 143 N. Y. 476, 39 N. E. 11. We write upon this same subject in another case at this present term, presenting the like proposition. McDonald v. Surety Co., 66 N. Y. Supp. 475. And see, also, Hale v. Sweet, 40 N. Y. 99. The facts before us, shown by the record, would call for reversal on other grounds discussed by counsel, concerning testimony admitted over objection and exception; but, since <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>the main question is resolved in favor of appellants, such grounds need not be further considered.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-5\">Judgment and order appealed from must be reversed, and new trial ordered, with costs to appellant to abide the event.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-6\">CONLAN, J., concurs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
