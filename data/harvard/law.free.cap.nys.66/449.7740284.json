In fact there is no evidence in the case that the defendant rented the premises for the month of April, 1898. The learned justice should not have allowed the defendant\u2019s set-off for $80 for medical attendance to the plaintiff. According to the defendant\u2019s testimony, nothing was said about his rendering free medical attendance to the plaintiff or her family. If the defendant was employed, the husband of the plaintiff is liable in law, and not the plaintiff herself. This, evidently, was the defendant\u2019s understanding, for the bill rendered by bim was made out to the husband of the plaintiff, and not to the plaintiff. Judgment reversed, and new trial ordered, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
