Both sides at the trial moved for direction of a verdict in plaintiff\u2019s favor. No motion for dismissal of complaint was made by defendants when plaintiff rested, as might properly have been done, so their point that plaintiff had not proven ownership is not well taken; the right to so object having been waived by their silence. We think that, under the authorities cited (Cromwell v. Sac Co., 96 U. S. 51, 24 L. Ed. 681; City of Aurora v. West, 7 Wall. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>82, 19 L. Ed. 42; Bank v. Milliman, 31 Misc. Rep. 87, 65 N. Y.
