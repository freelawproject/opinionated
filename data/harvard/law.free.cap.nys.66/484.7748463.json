For these three, elements of damage plaintiff sought to recover back the sum of $700, paid by him at the time of purchase, and also $500 as damages for the false representations, \u2014$1,200 in all. Plaintiff alleged that he had been compelled to remove from the premises shortly after he had entered into posses<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>sion and enjoyment under his contract of purchase. It does not appear that the defendants procured an assignment of their lease to be made to plaintiff. The landlord would not recognize and accept plaintiff as tenant, but actually began proceeding for dispossession.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-5\">It seems that the charge, upon which the whole case was left with the jury, strictly conformed with the ruling set forth in Voltz v. Blackmar, 64 N. Y. 444; and, even though the trial justice might have deemed it a case where a smaller amount than was awarded would have done better justice between the parties, yet the limit, in his opinion, being less than excessive, he had the right and thought it proper not to set aside the verdict, since so well within the peculiar province of the jury. Kiff v. Youmans, 20 Hun, 125. We think this view correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-6\">Judgment and order appealed from affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-7\">FITZSIMONS, C.
