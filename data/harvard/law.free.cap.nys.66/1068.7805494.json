The motion was denied at special term, and from the order denying the motion this appeal is brought; the relator urging that his removal was illegal, for two reasons,\u2014one of them, that he is protected by chapter 708 of the Laws of 1887; and the other, that he is protected by the constitution and the provisions of chapter 370 of the Laws of 1899 known as the \u201cWhite Civil Service Law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1089-5\">If it be conceded that chapter 708 of the Laws of 1887 (a local statute dealing with the employ\u00e9s of the various departments of the city of Brooklyn and county of Kings) is still in force, it may be questioned whether it affords the protection which the relator demands. Mr. Justice Cullen had this statute under consideration in People v. England, 16 App. Div. 97, 45 N. Y. Supp. 12; and it was there held that a clerk of a police court in the city of Brooklyn, appointed under section 14 of title 21 of chapter 583 of the Laws of 1888, authorizing the police justices of that city to appoint clerks, the appointees to serve during the pleasure of the justices, is an independent public officer,. and, although a veteran soldier of the Civil War, his office does not fall within the provisions of section 1 of chapter 708 of the Laws of 1887, which relates solely to employ\u00e9s. The relator has evidently sought to avoid this ruling of the court by alleging that he \u201cheld a position in the county of Kings, being a process server or subordinate or detective in the district attorney\u2019s office\u201d; but it is evident that he was appointed to his position under the provisions of chapter 772 of the Laws of 1896, which declares that there shall be \u201cofficers known as county detectives in the county of Kings and such officers are hereby created.\u201d Under the circumstances, it would be difficult to distinguish the case at bar from that of People v. England, supra. Clearly, the tenure of a clerk of a court, where the statute provides for the appointment of one or more clerks, to hold office \u201cduring the pleasure of the justice appointing them,\u201d is not materially different from that of a county detective created by statute, and to hold-office \u201cduring the pleasure of the said district attorney.\u201d They are both, as Mr. Justice Cullen suggests, \u201cindependent public officers,\u201d and not mere employ\u00e9s of a department of the city; and they are not, therefore, within the provisions of the statute of 1887. \u201cWhen to this is added,\u201d say the court in the case cited, \u201cthe express provision of the statute that each justice should appoint a clerk, and the clerk hold office at the pleasure of the justice, I think it clear that the legislature did not intend to make the office <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1070\">*1070</page-number>of clerk subject to any provisions of law which would give an incumbent a permanent tenure.\u201d The remark is equally applicable to the statute under which the relator was appointed. This is manifest when it is remembered that chapter 708 of the-Laws of 1887 is a local law, and that chapter 772 of the Laws of 1896 is of the same character, and distinctly provides, in section 7, that \u201call acts and parts of acts inconsistent with this act are hereby repealed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1090-5\">Under the doctrine of the case of People v. Dalton, 158 N. Y. 204, 52 N. E. 1119, we are of opinion that chapter 821 of the Laws of 1896 (substantially re-enacted as section 21 of chapter 370 of the Laws of 1899), entitled \u201can act to further amend chapter 716 of the Laws of 1894, entitled \u2018An act to amend chapter 312 of the Laws of 1884/ entitled \u2018An act respecting the employment of honorably discharged Union soldiers and sailors in the public service of the state of New York, relative to removals/ \u201d defines the measure of the relator\u2019s rights. Indeed, the relator, by demanding a peremptory writ of mandamus, practically concedes that he is not proceeding under the provisions of chapter 708 of the Laws of 1887; for it was held in People v. Goetting, 133 N. Y. 569, 30 N. E. 968, that a mandamus would not lie, under the provisions of this act as re-enacted in section 29 of title 22 of chapter 583 of the Laws of 1888, to try the title of one claiming a public office filled by another, holding under color of right, where the question of title turns upon a construction of statutory provisions which are not entirely clear and unambiguous. It was there held that his remedy was by information in the nature of a quo warranta. The remedy by mandamus was first granted inferentially in 1894, and in 1896 it was expressly provided that a veteran improperly removed should have \u201ca remedy by mandamus for righting the wrong.\u201d This remedy is for wrongs committed under the provisions of chapter 821 of the Laws of 1896, and not for wrongs committed against the relator as an employ\u00e9 of the city of Brooklyn under the provisions of chapter 708 of the Laws of 1887, assuming it to be in force. 'Chapter 821 of. the Laws of 1896 is repealed by chapter 370 of the Laws of 1899, but it is substantially re-enacted as section 21 of the repealing chapter; and the rights of the relator must be deemed to be fixed by the law- as it now stands, which provides that \u201cnothing in this section shall be construed to apply to the position of private secretary or deputy of any official or department, or to any other person holding a strictly confidential relation to the appointing- officer.\u201d Is the position of the relator \u201cstrictly confidential\u201d? If we read the provisions of chapter 772, we can hardly \u25a0doubt that the legislature contemplated that these county detectives should be strictly confidential officers. They were to \u201cbe attached to the office of the district attorney of said county,\u201d and they were empowered, under the direction of the district attorney, to preserve order, \u201cto serve all papers and processes issued from the said office and to examine all bench warrants and orders of arrest in criminal cases and to perform such other duties as may from time to time be required of them by the said district attorney.\u201d In People <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1071\">*1071</page-number>v. Gardiner, 157 N. Y. 520, 52 N. E. 564, it was held that unofficial \u201csubpoena servers\u201d in the employ of the district attorney of the city and county of New York were occupying a \u201cstrictly confidential\u201d relation to such officer, under the meaning of the statute now under consideration; and no reason suggests itself why the relator\u2019s position as an independent official is less confidential in its relations, or why considerations of public policy do not justify the defendant in dismissing him. In the case cited, the court, adopting the opinion of the special term, say:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1091-5\">\u201cIt is clear to one who understands the duties of a district attorney\u2014the methods necessary to adopt to successfully prosecute criminals\u2014that the relation of the highest confidence must exist and be preserved on the part of the prosecuting officer towards every subordinate who can or may, under any circumstances, be possessed of office secrets, or operate any part of the secret machinery of the office. Any weakening of this confidence, whether it arises through actual cause or suspicion of matters unprovable, at once affects the efficiency of the service. There is no cure for this but removal.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1091-6\">The order appealed from should be affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
