Judgment is asked that he account to the plaintiff, and pay to him his proportionate share of the profits. The answer denied that there was any such agreement as stated in the complaint. The plaintiff then made application for the examination of the defendant before trial, alleging that he is a nonresident, and that his testimony is material and necessary to show that the agreement mentioned was made, and that profits were realized in carrying it out, which matters were peculiarly within the knowledge of the defendant, who retained all the reports in his exclusive control. The order for the examination was thereupon granted. Subsequently the defendant moved to vacate the order, restating in his affidavit the denials of the answer, and showing that he lived in Chicago, and could not well remain in New York to give the evidence asked for, and asserting that there are persons, in this city familiar with 'the facts sought to be obtained. An answering affidavit by the plaintiff states that he endeavored to ascertain the information desired, but could find no one other than the defendant who has knowledge thereof. The motion to vacate the order was denied, and from the order so entered the defendant appeals.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b1055-5\">Argued before VAN BRUNT, P.

If the action is not in fact by one partner against another, then, assuming that the allegations of the complaint can be sustained, it is so similar that the rules and methods of procedure adopted in partnership actions may be applied. Here it is essential that the plaintiff should obtain the evidence necessary to prove the alleged agreement, and that, out of the project to which it related, profits arose; and upon establishing these facts he would be entitled to an interlocutory judgment for an accounting. It being shown by the affidavits that the evidence required to prove the primary facts relating to the agreement and the profits is peculiarly within the knowledge of the defendant, whose testimony\u2014he being a nonresident\u2014cannot with certainty be secured upon the trial, we think that plaintiff is entitled to an examination for the purposes stated; i. e. to prove the agreement and resulting profits.</p>\n<p id=\"b1055-9\">If the plaintiff does not succeed in proving these facts, his complaint will be dismissed; but, until he has shown upon the trial that he is entitled to the relief demanded, he should not be at liberty to examine the defendant with regard to the details of the profits, or, in other words, to have an accounting concerning profits which, as it may turn out, the defendant may have made in an enterprise in which the plaintiff has no interest. If the defendant will stipulate in a general way that there were profits, the particulars of which can be inquired into upon the accounting, should the plaintiff succeed in proving the agreement as alleged, then the order herein should be modified by con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1036\">*1036</page-number>fining the examination to the eliciting o\u00ed facts tending to prove the agreement. Upon such a stipulation being given, the order should be modified in accordance therewith, without costs to either party in this court; but, upon the defendant\u2019s failure or refusal to give the stipulation, the order appealed from should be affirmed, with $10 costs and disbursements. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
