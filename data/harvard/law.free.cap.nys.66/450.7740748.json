It is unnecessary to pass upon this question, because the cause should not have been submitted to the jury at all: In order to maintain their action, it was necessary for the plaintiffs to show that J. Henry Banger was authorized to act as the agent of the defendants for the purpose of negotiating the loan in respect to which the plaintiffs claim a commission. No competent evidence of such an agency was presented. Consequently, the complaint should have been dismissed by the court. Judgment affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
