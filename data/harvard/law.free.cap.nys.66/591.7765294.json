Scallan.\u201d The contest is between Scallan and Brooks, the executor of the last will and testament of Bridget Steggles. The real question in the case relates to the ownership of this money on deposit. Does it be- \u25a0 long to the plaintiff, or is it assets of the estate of Mrs. Steggles, passing to her executor? From the evidence it is quite clear that Mrs. Steggles opened the account with the savings bank, and personally received the passbook, which she retained in her possession until the day before her death, when she handed it to the person named as executor in her will. From the form in which the account was opened by Mrs. Steggles, and the fact of her acceptance of the passbook, with the nature of the account and of the deposit stated in it, and from the evidence of two witnesses of statements and declarations made by Mrs. Steggles that she constituted the trust for the benefit of the plaintiff, the referee was authorized to find, as he did, that a trust for the plaintiff was created. The devotion of the money to a trust for the benefit of Scallan must be deemed, under the authorities cited in Farleigh v. Cadman, 159 N. Y. 169, 53 N. E. 808, and in Williams v. Bank, 51 App. Div. 332, 64 N. Y. Supp. 1021, to constitute an irrevocable trust. The retention of the passbook by Mrs. Steggles can only be regarded as the possession by a trustee of a muniment of title. If the deposit in trust is to be regarded as a gift, no question can arise of incompleteness of that gift by reason of the nondelivery of the subject of it to the donee; for, the trust existing, possession and title necessarily would be in the trustee. There is no question of revocation of the trust, by will or otherwise. The judgment appealed from should be affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
