They had before them all of the witnesses, and heard their testimony, and saw the manner in which they testified; and their judgment of defendant\u2019s guilt and plaintiff\u2019s innocence should be respected. We should not and will not interfere with the finding of jury unless it is clear that they were influenced by prejudice, bias, or unfair considerations in their deliberation. No such accusation can be made herein, as we read the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-17\">The judgment must be affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
