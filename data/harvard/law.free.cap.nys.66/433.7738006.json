The plaintiff testified that on the 23d day of January, 1900, he had a conversation with the defendants, who were cloak manufacturers in the borough of Manhattan, in the course of which conversation they employed him as an operator on cloaks until the 1st day of May following, at $20 per week. The defendants denied the making of such alleged agreement, and contended that they only employed the plaintiff by the week, but the justice settled the conflict of evidence in favor of the latter by rendering a judgment in his favor for $109.30, besides costs and extra costs. The defendants, in support of the appeal brought on by them, contend that the alleged contract of employment is invalid for lack of mutuality, because the proof fails to show that the plaintiff agreed with the defendants to work until May 1st. The record, however, does not support such contention. The plaintiff testified on his direct examination:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b454-11\">\u201cQ. State the conversation you had with the defendant. A. He told me he wanted to take me to work. Q. What else? A. I told him then I could not make piece work. He said, \u2018All right, you can work here by the week.\u2019 Q. Well, go ahead. A. He told me that he\u2019ll give me $20 a week until the 1st day of May. Q. What did you say? A. I told him that it isn\u2019t enough,\u2014$20. He said, therefore, T give you steady work till May; you don\u2019t need to stop.\u2019 Q. Did you begin to work? A. I started the 23d of January.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b454-12\">Upon cross-examination the plaintiff further testified that on several prior occasions he worked for the defendants \u201cby the piece\u201d; that he called upon them at their request, and that he went to work for the defendants the same day he had the above-noted conversation with them. Such conversation fairly imports a mutuality of contract, giving rise to a duty on the part of the defendants to receive the plaintiff in their employ until the 1st day of May following, at $20 per week, and a reciprocal obligation on the part of the plaintiff to enter the defendants\u2019 employment for such period and upon the said terms.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-13\">Assuming, however, for the sake of argument, that there was no mutuality in the inception of the contract, such want of mutuality may, nevertheless, be remedied by the subsequent conduct of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>parties, or by the execution of the agreement. 7 Am. &amp; Eng. Enc. Law (2d Ed.) p. 115. The proof brings the case within this principle. The plaintiff testified that he started to work for the defendants on the said 23d day of January, 1900, and continued in their employ until the 18th day of March of the same year, when he was discharged; that in each week during such period the defendants paid to him $19, and withheld $1, against the will of the plaintiff. Regarding the circumstances of his discharge, the plaintiff testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b455-5\">\u201cQ. Well, did he give you the reason why he discharged you? A. He says he hasn\u2019t much to do. Q. Did you tell him that you were engaged up to May 1st? A. Yes. Q. What did he say to that? A. He told me then, \u2018If you want to work by the piece, then it\u2019s all right; I can\u2019t afford to pay you $20 a week.\u2019 Q. And you refused to work by the piece? A. Yes, sir.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b455-6\">An admission by the defendants of the validity of the contract may be fairly inferred from this testimony, as well as from that given by one Louis Lipshitz, who testified that he informed one of the defendants of his disinclination to enter the defendants\u2019 employ without an agreement in writing on their part to employ him until the 1st day of May next, at $15 per week, to which this defendant rejoined: \u201cFor what you want an agreement? This other man (Sagalowitz) gets more. He gets $20 a week, and he believes me on my word.\u201d \u201cQ. Did you remain to work? A. I refused to work.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b455-7\">Error is also claimed in the exclusion of evidence tending to show the number of persons in the defendants\u2019 employ at the time when the contract in suit was made, and that other employ\u00e9s were employed by the week as distinguished from an employment until the month of May following. We do not think, however, that this error, if error it was, is sufficient to call for a reversal of the judgment, in view of the fact that the witness had already testified that he never had employed a man for a period ending the 1st of May, except one man, who was a designer. This, we think, fully covered all that the defendants were entitled to show in the matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-8\">The cases cited by the appellants, viz. Flagg v. Reilly, 23 App. Div. 57, 48 N. Y. Supp. 544, and Krieger v. Kaye (Sup.) 65 N. Y. Supp. 213, have no application, for the reason that they differ essentially in their facts from those of the present case. The former was an action to recover a balance of commissions for soliciting a policy of insurance. The plaintiff claimed that he was promised a commission of 25 per cent., while the defendant claimed that the commission was to be only 10 per cent. The latter sought to prove upon the trial what the usual commission was that was paid to persons employed as was the plaintiff. The evidence was excluded, and upon appeal it was held that this ruling was error. The other case was one to recover damages for an alleged breach of contract of employment. The plaintiff claimed that he was hired for a year, which the defendants denied. The plaintiff, against the latter\u2019s objection and exception, was permitted to show, by the testimony of third persons, that he had a contract with them for one year at the time he entered into negotiations with the defendants. This court held that such testimony was proper, since it bore upon the probability of the plaintiff of throwing- up such agreement, as he did, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>without securing from the defendants another one of equal, if not greater, advantage.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-4\">There being no other ground of asserted error apparent in the record, the judgment should be affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
