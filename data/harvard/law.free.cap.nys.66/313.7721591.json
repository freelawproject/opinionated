Judgment was rendered against the defendants for $185, damages, together with costs and extra costs. Although what seems to have been regarded as the value of such suits appears to have been taken into consideration by the justice in assessing the damages, the record fails to disclose any proof whatever that the same were ever in the possession or under the control of the defendants. Under these circumstances, the judgment must be reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to the appellants to abide the event.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
