In Boyd v. Gorman, 157 N. Y. 365, 368, 52 N. E. 113, the court, per Yann, J., discussing the incorporation of the subdivision in question, say:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b431-15\">\u201cThus, we have progressive action towards the single object of relieving a court overburdened with work. The legislature, in the exercise of its power to restrict appeals, wisely selected those classes of actions in which the law has been so well settled for so long a period as to make a second appeal unnecessary, except in rare instances, involving new questions, when permission can readily be obtained.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b431-16\">Actions of a character similar to this do not meet the reason given by the court for the restriction, inasmuch as they actually require the construction of express statutory provisions, rather than the application of well-settled general principles of law. For these reasons, we think that the motion should be denied, as not necessary in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-17\">Motion denied, without costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
