Plaintiff\u2019s certificate of a share in the association recited that, in case the holder, at any time before maturity of the stock, desired to withdraw from the association, he should receive the amount paid for the certificate, with dividends at the rate of 6 per cent.

Another section declared that any shareholder wishing to withdraw his stock might he allowed to do so at any time. The certificate contained an agreement to pay $200 on maturity to plaintiff in consideration, among other things, of his agreement to abide by all the terms, conditions, and by-laws of the association, and recited that it was \u201cfurther agreed\u201d that he might withdraw his stock before maturity, and receive the amount paid for it, together with dividends at the rate of 6 per cent. <em>Held, </em>that the second clause of the certificate should be construed together with the first, and controlled by the first, and- hence, where, during the month of plaintiff\u2019s demand for the withdrawal, the receipts of the association were insufficient to allow the association to pay the amount paid by the plaintiff, together with dividends, he could not recover such amount.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"history\" id=\"b130-9\">Appeal from special term, Oswego county.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b130-10\">Action by Abraham W.

Plaintiff bases his action upon a clause in the certificate of shares issued to him which provided that, in case he at any time before maturity of said stock desired to withdraw from the association, he should receive the full amount paid for the certificate, with dividends at the rate of 6 per cent, per annum. The defendant is an ordinary building and loan association. The stock issued to plaintiff was what was known as \u201cpaid-up stock.\u201d He was not to pay anything more upon it, but the bal.ance of $100 of the par value, over and above what he paid, was to he made up from the accumulation of profits thereon. Desiring to withdraw before the stock matured, he made a demand upon the company for the sum for which he now sues. What took place upon that demand being made is covered by a stipulation in the case, and it is to the effect that the attorney went to the defendant\u2019s office, and \u201cthen and there offered to surrender the certificate in this case upon the .payment of the amount of capital invested, to wit, $100, together with dividends upon the same from the 1st day of November, 1892, at the rate of six per cent., which he stated was provided for upon the face of the certificate, but would allow the association to dediict the expense element, as provided for in the second paragraph of the terms and conditions printed on the back of the certificate. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>His offer to surrender the certificate upon the above condition was rejected, and he was informed that payment would be made in accordance with the terms of the articles of incorporation and the by-laws, if the said certificate was surrendered for withdrawal; that said certificate had not earned the amount which the plaintiff\u2019s attorney demanded, and for that reason he (the defendant\u2019s officer) refused to pay it.\u201d Three defenses are urged by the defendant, which I shall consider: First, that neither at the time of the alleged demand or proof of claim on the defendant, nor at any time since, has the defendant had any moneys in its tre\u00e1sury applicable, under its articles of incorporation and by-laws, to the payment of the plaintiff\u2019s shares; second, that the payment of dividends \"at 6 per cent., as demanded by plaintiff, would exceed the net earnings of the shares of stock in question, said earnings having amounted to but 4 per cent.; third, that the defendant association, under its by-laws, was entitled to 60 days after demand or filing of proof of claim in which to pay, and that this action, having been commenced on the very day of the demand, was prematurely brought.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b131-4\">I will consider these defenses in the inverse order of their above statement. Assuming for the present that the plaintiff is bound by defendant\u2019s by-laws in operation at the time when this certificate was issued to him, I do not think that they sustain this last defense. Section 17 of them provides: \u201cThe association shall have sixty days after the filing of the proof of a claim and the approval thereof by the board of directors in which to pay the same, and this applies to claims maturing by death as well as to maturity of stock.\u201d As stated above, plaintiff bases his action upon his election to withdraw the sum paid by him to defendant for its shares before maturity thereof, as it is provided in the certificate issued to him he may do. The clause just quoted, and upon which defendant relies to sustain the defense now being considered, is, by its terms, made applicable to claims based upon death and upon maturity of stock, and is not applicable to plaintiff\u2019s case.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b131-5\">I think the second defense stated is sustained. Plaintiff did not give any evidence to show that his shares of stock had earned 6 per cent, dividends from the date they were issued to him. Upon the other hand, evidence was given by defendant to the effect that they had earned only about 4 per cent., and this, upon the trial, was assumed to be the fact. If plaintiff is subject to and bound by defendant\u2019s articles of incorporation and by-laws,\u2014as I think he is,\u2014he is certainly limited, upon withdrawal of his stock, to its net earnings. Article 12 of defendant\u2019s articles of incorporation provides for the withdrawal of stock before maturity, as plaintiff is seeking to do, but it places a limitation upon the amount of interest or dividends to be paid upon such withdrawal, as follows: \u201cShares which are not pledged may be withdrawn before maturity, * * * with such additional interest, if any, as the bylaws may .provide, except that the same shall not exceed the net earnings of said stock.\u201d Independent, however, of express provisions by the defendant, I have no doubt that the general principles of law cover this subject, and limit plaintiff\u2019s right to income upon his stock to its earnings. The clause in his certificate upon which he relies herein provides that upon withdrawal before maturity he shall receive the full amount paid for his certificate, \u201cwith dividends at the rate of 6 per cent, per annum.\u201d It will thus be noted that the obligation of the company, when narrowly tested by this clause alone, is not to pay a certain sum with a fixed rate of interest, but with a certain rate of dividend. It does not seem necessary to urge or reason at length that this language assured the \u25a0 plaintiff as a stockholder in defendant the earnings upon his stock up to a certain per cent.; that thereby defendant did not, and could not if it would, guaranty that such earnings should reach a certain figure; that if, as matter of fact, the earnings subject to a division upon this stock only reached 4 per cent., that would be the limit of plaintiff\u2019s rights; that defendant was not bound to pay, but by various principles of law and statutory provisions was prohibited from p'aying, to plaintiff upon his stock dividends at a greater rate than it earned. Plaintiff\u2019s only demand for payment of and offer to surrender his shares made it an essential condition that lie should receive an amount equal to dividends at the rate of 6 per cent. The point was expressly raised by the defendant that his stock had not earned and was not entitled to it. His demand and offer were not a sufficient basis for this action.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"A2J\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>I pass to the consideration of the third defense. Upon June 19, 1899, when plaintiff presented his certificate, and attempted to withdraw his moneys from defendant, there had been presented for similar withdrawal stock to the amount of \u00a7421,829.46, and there was on hand applicable to the payment of withdrawals only \u00a71,800. During the month of June prior to plaintiff\u2019s demand there had been presented for withdrawal stock aggregating \u00a73,023.10, and there had been received as applicable to the payment of such withdrawals but \u00a72,257.76. So that, if defendant is entitled to limit its payment of attempted withdrawals to the amounts received from its members (its only source of income), and in the order in which applications are made for withdrawal, plaintiff was not entitled to receive his money when he conimenced his action. And this, upon the figures given, would be so even should the proposed withdrawals and receipts of each month be considered by themselves. If plaintiff is bound by defendant\u2019s rules and regulations in force at the time he took out his certificate, he is limited to payment upon withdrawal in the manner claimed. Article 12 of the articles of incorporation provides: \u201cIn no event shall the association be required to pay to withdrawing members more than one-half of the net receipts of the monthly installments paid in during the month in which the withdrawals occur.\u201d Section 19 of article 14 of the by-laws provides: \u201cAny shareholder wishing to withdraw his stock may be allowed to do so at any time, but the association shall not be required to pay out more than one-half of the net receipts of the monthly installments paid in that month to withdrawing members.\u201d After plaintiff purchased his stock, another by-law was passed, which is urged upon my attention in this connection. It reads: \u201cPayments shall be made in the order of the applications for Withdrawal, but the association shall not be required to pay out on withdrawing or matured stock more than one-half the amount received from dues and stock payments in any month.\u201d I do not regard this provision as materially affecting this case. If the other provisions already quoted apply, I think the rule should be, independent of express provision to that effect, that, if the funds on hand applicable to the payment of withdrawals were insufficient to pay them all, they should be applied to payment in the order in which applications for withdrawal were made. So far as the latter part of the last provision is concerned, it is broader in plaintiff\u2019s favor as to the funds from which withdrawals may be paid than those in force when he joined the company. Plaintiff denies that he is bound by the provisions quoted. In his application for shares he says: \u201cI hereby agree to abide by all the terms, conditions, and by-laws contained or referred to in the certificate of shares, and will also comply with all the rules and regulations of said association.\u201d The certificate of shares issued to him recited that the agreements therein made by the company are so made in consideration of the moneys paid by plaintiff to it, and also of \u201cagreements and statements contained in the application for membership, * * * together with full compliance with the terms, conditions, and by-laws of this corporation.\u201d I do not understand that the plaintiff claims that his certificate of shares was generally free from and superior to the restrictions, of the articles of incorporation and by-laws now relied upon by defendant. But he insists that the clause in it relating to the right to withdraw, and payment thereupon, standing by itself, is an absolute and unconditional promise, and free from the Qualifications urged by defendant. It seems to me, however, that this is too narrow and restricted a construction. The certificate on its face starts out with an agreement to pay \u00a7200 upon maturity, etc., to plaintiff, in consideration of his agreement (in effect) to abide by all the terms, conditions, and bylaws of the association. Then right along, in continuation of this agreement, \u201cit is further agreed\u201d that he may withdraw his stock before maturity, and receive the amount paid for it, etc. No question is made but that the first ' clause of the agreement is subject to the provisions urged by defendant, and it seems to me that it would be a very strained interpretation to hold that the second clause, relied upon by plaintiff, is to be considered entirely by itself, and independent of all the other provisions of the certificate. Resorting to pretty narrow rules of construction, the word \u201cfurther\u201d in \u201cit is further agreed\u201d naturally implies, a continuation of the preceding agreements, and subject to the same conditions. But, viewing it from another standpoint, this was a mutual association. Plaintiff, under the terms, of his application for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>and certificate of stock, is to be charged with notice and knowledge of the provisions of the articles of association and by-laws. They both told him that the company could not be compelled to pay withdrawing members except from certain funds. These or some similar provisions were quite essential for the protection of all the members of the company. As said by Judge Andrews in a case against a similar association: \u201cIt was essential to the practical working of the scheme and purpose of the organization. The association, if the plan was followed, could have no assets of any considerable amount available for immediate repayment of dues paid in by withdrawing members. It was not a moneyed corporation in any proper sense, and would not, in the ordinary course of its business, have assets readily convertible into money. Its assets would be represented in the main by loans to members on mortgages, payable in small weekly payments. If no restriction existed preventing withdrawing members from immediately maintaining actions to recover their dues . and enforcing judgments obtained, it is evident that this and similar associations would have a precarious existence. They would be in peril at almost any moment to have their operations arrested, and to be thrown into a receivership, by the conjoint action of a few withdrawing members. The beneficial purpose of the statute for the encouragement of small savings would be frustrated, and the assets of the association subjected to costs and expenses which would seriously impair the general fund contributed by the members.\u201d Engelhardt v. Association, 148 N. Y. 281, 285, 42 N. B. 710, 35 L. It. A. 289, 297. Being thus chargeable with knowledge of the general nature and purpose of the association which he was joining, and of its rules and regulations, I think it must be held that when plaintiff took from defendant its agreement to pay him upon withdrawal before maturity a certain sum he took it subject to the qualifications as to method and manner of payment now claimed by it. I do not regard the case of Sinteff v. Association, 37 App. Div. 340, 57 N. Y. Supp. 611, especially relied upon by plaintiff\u2019s counsel, as an authority for his claims in this action. That case simply holds that a promise made by such an association, absolute and unconditional, cannot be qualified in important and substantial respects by regulations adopted afterwards. It does not hold that such promise is independent of or superior to the articles of incorporation and by-laws in force at the time of its making. It proceeds upon quite the opposite theory.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b133-3\">Judgment ordered dismissing plaintiff\u2019s complaint, with costs.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b133-4\">Argued before ADAMS, P.
