The record and briefs, with the cases cited, were carefully examined and considered. The evidence showed that gas manufactured by the de-\u201e fendant leaked into the plaintiffs\u2019 apartments from a meter put into a neighbor\u2019s premises by one of the defendant\u2019s collectors. We were of the opinion that the fact that the company had placed it in the collector\u2019s power to connect a meter with their service was some evidence of his authority to do what he did, notwithstanding his denial that he had any such authority, and that hence the question whether he acted within the scope of his employment was properly left to the jury by Mr. Justice Gaynor.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-4\">Motion for reargument denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
