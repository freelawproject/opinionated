The action was tried by the court without a jury, and on the 17th day of July, 1899, the court filed a memorandum opinion in which it said, 'Final judgment may be granted as against the plaintiff, with costs.\u201d The decision of the court, which embraced findings of fact and conclusions of law, was rendered on the 9th day of September; and upon that date an interlocutory judgment was entered, decreeing a partition of the premises in dispute, and adjudging the defendant Mary A. Denike to be the owner' of two-thirds of the property. The final judgment, which is involved in this appeal, was entered on the 11th day of August, 1899, prior to the decision and interlocutory judgment. The \u25a0interlocutory judgment provided that the question of costs (which, by the provisions of section 1022 of the 'Code of Civil Procedure, must be awarded by the decision of the court or report of the referee) should be fixed by the final judgment, and this had already been entered when the decision was made. There can be no doubt, therefore, that the judgment now before us, being without findings or a decision to support it, should be reversed. Hall v. Beeston, 13 App. Div. 116, 43 N. Y. Supp. 304; Shaffer v. Martin, 20 App. Div. 304, 46 N. Y. Supp. 992, and authorities cited. It appears necessary, under the circumstances, which are substantially the same as those presented in. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>Reynolds v. Insurance Co., 6 App. Div. 254, 39 N. Y. Supp. 885, that there should be a new trial. If practicable., we should remit the case to the trial court, in order that proper findings or a formal decision might there be made, as was done in the two cases first above cited; but this course canot be pursued, inasmuch as the judge who tried the case is now a justice of the appellate division in the Third department.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-5\">Judgment reversed, and new trial granted; costs to abide the final award of costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
