Among the assets of the estate was a deposit in the name of the testator in the Williamsburg Savings Bank, amounting to $1,344.30, which had come into the appellant\u2019s possession in the course of the preparation of the executors\u2019 accounts for the purpose of settlement. On the 8th of May, 1900, the appellant drew the money from the bank, and retained it in his possession under and by virtue of a claim to a lien thereon for his services. The money was drawn on an order signed by one of the executors, who accompanied the appellant to the bank, and who makes affidavit that the appellant stood close to the bank teller\u2019s window, and took possession of the money before he (the executor) was able to secure it. The order appealed from, as resettled, requires the appellant to deposit the money to the credit of the executors. The appellant has no lien upon the money. By the amendment to section 66 of the Code of Civil Procedure, effected by chapter 61 of the Laws of 1899, it may be assumed that proceedings in surrogate\u2019s courts were included within the provisions of the section. As so amended, the section provides that the attorney has a lien upon his client\u2019s cause of action, claim, or counterclaim, which attaches to a verdict, report, decision, judgment, or final order in his client\u2019s favor, and the proceeds thereof. The money in dispute is not within the description cited, nor does it proceed from any cause of action, claim, -or counterclaim, or any resultant verdict, order, decision, etc. The section, does not purport to give a general lien upon all moneys belonging to the client. Moreover, the amendment did not take effect until September 1, 1899, while the appellant\u2019s services appear to have \u2022been rendered in great part, if not wholly, before that date. The \u25a0amendment is purely prospective in its operation. \u2022 Goodrich v. McDonald, 112 N. Y. 157, 19 N. E. 649.</p>\n<p id=\"b1142-7\">Whether the appellant has or has not a lien upon the money, the order appealed from in no respect impairs his rights. It only provides for the safe custody of the estate of the deceased until his claim and rights, with those of others, can be judicially investigated and determined. This was the view taken by the former general term of this department in the very similar case of In re De Oraindi (Sup.) 9 N. Y. Supp. 873, and in which it was held that an \u2022order directing an attorney to deposit moneys which he had collected for an estate pending an inquiry into a claim by the attorney to hold them for services rendered to the estate is within the discretion of the surrogate.</p>\n<p id=\"b1142-8\">The order may also be upheld, irrespective of the validity of the appellant\u2019s claim of a lien, as ancillary to the power of the court to determine and enforce the lien under section 66 of the Code by virtue of the additional amendment made by chapter 61 of the Laws of 1899, to the effect that the court, upon the petition of the client <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1123\">*1123</page-number>or attorney, may determine and enforce the lien. This amendment relates to the remedy only, arid would seem quite applicable to a case like this, where the attorney has possession of a fund belonging to the client considerably in excess of his claim for services, and asserts the right to retain it by virtue of a lien. The order should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1143-5\">Order of the surrogate\u2019s court of Kings county affirmed, with $10 costs and. disbursements. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
