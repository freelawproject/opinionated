It was peculiarly his province so to do, and unless against the weight of evidence, which, after an examination of the proofs, we cannot assert, the judgment must be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-18\">Our attention is called, however, to an item of the recovery amounting to $1.50, as to which no proof whatsoever was given, and which, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>doubtless through inadvertence, was included by the trial justice in the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-4\">The judgment will therefore be modified by deducting therefrom the item in question, and as so modified affirmed, with costs to the respondent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
