In this the court erred. The testimony satisfactorily establishes plaintiff\u2019s employment and the sale of the property in question. The purchaser procured by the plaintiff was one Weinstein. For reasons of his own, the contract was signed and deed taken in the name of one Cohen, with whom Weinstein, who <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>supplied the purchase money, was associated in the transaction. An agent cannot be deprived of his commission merely because the actual purchaser takes title in another\u2019s name. Randrup v. Schroeder, 22 Misc. Rep. 367, 49 N. Y. Supp. 290. The gist of the action is, was the plaintiff the procuring cause of the sale? The details of the closing are but incidents of the transaction, which confer or destroy no rights. Even without resorting to the rule that the construc- \u201e tian most favorable to the plaintiff must be put upon the testimony, it is clear that a cause of action was made out when plaintiff rested, and it was error to dismiss the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-4\">Judgment reversed, and new trial ordered, with costs to the appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
