Rep. 786, 55 N. Y. Supp. 574. Upon that appeal the case was reversed because the price at which the property was taken on the exchange, and upon which amount was based the plaintiff\u2019s claim for brokerage, did not clearly appear in the record. Here the-evidence as to the value of the property at the time \u2022of exchange, in the procurement of which exchange the plaintiff claims to have been an important factor, is equally vague; the return failing to present any proof of a positive nature tending to establish this value with sufficient definiteness to afford a basis for the computation of the plaintiff\u2019s commissions. A careful examination of the record leads us to the opinion that, upon the evidence contained therein, the judgment rendered was founded mainly upon assumption; the evidence being insufficient to warrant the conclusion arrived at.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-8\">The judgment should therefore be reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to the appellant to abide the event.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-9\">O\u2019GORMAN, J., not voting.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
