This claim was originally tried in 1896, upon which trial the couit of claims dismissed the claim. Upon appeal this determination was reversed, and a new hearing ordered. See 15 App. Div. 169, 44 N. Y. Supp. 281. The case was retried in the court of claims in 1898, resulting in a judgment for the claimant of $1,692. This judgment was reversed in this court on account of insufficiency of damages. The claim was again heard, and resulted in the judgment from which this appeal is taken. The claimant was the owner of a paper mill upon the outlet of Skaneateles Lake. The state owns and controls a dam at the outlet of the lake, by means of which it controls the discharge of the water from the lake into the outlet. During a part of 1892 the state withheld the water from this outlet, and thereby deprived the plaintiff of the power to run his mill, causing the damage for which this claim is made.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b980-8\">Argued before PARKER, P.

Upon the former appeal the rules of law by which the damage should be measured were enunciated, and the court of claims will be presumed to have followed these rules, unless it otherwise appear from their decision. The result stated in the decision is a possible result as a resolution of a question of fact, the court passing upon the credibility of the evidence for the claimant. We are required, then, upon this appeal to assume that such was the method by which it was reached; and, even if we deemed a false theory indicated in the opinion, the error is beyond our reach. It appears in the decision, however, that the interest upon the damage was awarded only from the date of the first judgment, to wit, June 26, 1896, and not from the date of the filing of the claim. That the claimant is entitled to this interest upon his claim from the date of the filing of the claim seems to have been settled both in this court and in the court of appeals, and in this very case. See this case upon the former appeal, 45 App. Div. 114, 60 N. Y. Supp. 1081. Wilson v. City of Troy, 135 N. Y. 96, 105, 32 N. E. 44, 18 L. R. A. 449; Weeks v. State, 48 App. Div. 357, 63 N. Y. Supp. 203. The authorities cited by the learned judge below are all cases of breach of contract, and in Wilson v. City of Troy, supra, that class of cases is clearly distinguished from cases where the action is brought for a trespass, where it seems to be held that interest should, as a matter of law, be allowed. This judgment should be modified, therefore, by adding thereto the interest upon $2,242 from January 14,1893, to June 26,1896, and,as thus modified, affirmed, with costs of this appeal to the claimant. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
