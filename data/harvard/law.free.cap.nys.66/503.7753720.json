He may even cross-examine the witnesses produced by the plaintiff, but he may not, even by his cross-examination, attempt to establish a defense. Hartness v. Boyd, 5 Wend. 563. An examination of the record shows that the justice did not, in fact, violate this rule. It is true that, when this appellant\u2019s counsel interposed an objection, the justice at first refused to entertain it, but he subsequently offered to rule upon the objection, if the appellant insisted; which, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>however, he did not do. Thereafter the appellant\u2019s counsel neither interposed an objection nor offered to cross-examine. The one objection that was made did not call for any ruling, for no reason was stated why the question was deemed to be improper. The only apparent objection was that the question was leading. That, however, was not a fatal objection, and, if overruled by the justice, would not have warranted a reversal of the judgment. We have carefully examined the record, and fail to find that any improper evidence was admitted, and the judgment was fully justified by the evidence that was received. The appeal does not present any question as to the stipulation for setting aside, the judgment. dSTo order was ever entered upon it. The appellant was the first to attempt to violate it. . It provided for a trial on July 10, 1900, and the appellant undertook to avoid it by giving a bond for a long adjournment. The tender of the bond was ineffectual, because it was not offered on the return day, or upon any day to which the cause was adjourned, but after judgment. The judgment must be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
