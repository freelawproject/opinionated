The action upon defendant's motion was duly transferred to this court. Upon the trial, judgment was recovered against defendant for $43.75. Upon defendant\u2019s application, a bill of costs was taxed by the clerk against plaintiff for $71.78, because she had failed to recover a judgment of $50 or over. Upon appeal to the special term by plaintiff, the clerk\u2019s taxation was affirmed. In our judgment, this was error. The defendant in this court had no greater rights than those conferred upon him in the district court. His rights, as well as plaintiff\u2019s rights, remained unchanged by the transfer. Upon recovery of this judgment, plaintiff obtained all the rights which she would have had if the action was tried in said court.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-10\">Order appealed from reversed, also clerk\u2019s taxation, and he is directed to tax the charges allowed by the Code, in plaintiff\u2019s favor. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
