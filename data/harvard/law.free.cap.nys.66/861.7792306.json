No controversy arises over the facts of the case, the sole contention of the defendant being- that by the amendment to the stock corporation law enacted in 1899 (Laws 1892, c. 688, as amended by Laws 1899, c. 354, adding section 34 thereto) the right to recover the penalty for a violation of the requirements of section 30 was abrogated, in consequence of which the plaintiff\u2019s complaint should have been dismissed. The action was commenced on February 3, 1899, and the act above referred to was not passed until April 18th of that year, and did not go into effect until the 8th day of May following. The question, therefore, which this appeal presents, calls for a determination of the effect of that statute upon actions which were commenced before, and were actually pending at the time of, its enactment. This precise question has recently been decided adversely to the appellants\u2019 contention by the appellate division of the First department in two cases, \u2014Vineyard Co. v. Fritz, 48 App. Div. 233, 62 N. Y. Supp. 775; Wine Co. v. Same, 49 App. Div. 647, 63 N. Y. Supp. 198,\u2014and those cases, until reversed, must be regarded as controlling upon this court. Without, therefore, discussing the various propositions advanced by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"862\">*862</page-number>the counsel in their respective briefs, we feel ourselves constrained to follow the decisions above referred to, and to affirm the judgment appealed from.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-5\">Judgment affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
