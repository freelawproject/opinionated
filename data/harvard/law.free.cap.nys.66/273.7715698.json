Plaintiff testified that after his employment he called at his attorney\u2019s office, and told him about the property; that thereafter he saw the purchaser\u2019s attorney; that he then called on defendant, told him the contract was ready for execution, and to sign it, which he did. A witness for plaintiff testified that he saw defendant in relation to the property, having received from plaintiff\u2019s attorney the information that the property was for sale; that he went, with defendant\u2019s attorney, to look at the property, and then went with him to the office of plaintiff\u2019s attorney, where the contract was signed; that he brought the purchaser to such office, and submitted the property to him and his attorney. There was no direct proof that witness was acting through-plaintiff. <em>Held, </em>that the evidence failed to show that plaintiff procured the purchaser, though defendant, at the execution of the contract of sale, promised to pay plaintiff\u2019s commission; since the promise must be assumed to have been made in the belief at the time that defendant procured the purchaser.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"history\" id=\"b293-7\">Appeal from city court of Mt.

The law requires proof. The action is brought to recover the sum of $500 as broker\u2019s commissions on the-sale of real estate belonging to the defendant. The defendant admitted on the trial that he agreed to pay the plaintiff the commission if he should secure a sale of the property, and the evidence shows that shortly thereafter the defendant and one Katherine Kohler, through her attorney, H. L. Tuck, executed a written contract for the sale of the property at the defendant\u2019s price. The plaintiff\u2019s connection with \u25a0 the transaction, according to his testimony, is confined to the fact' that, after the agreement had been made for his commission, he called: at the office of his attorney, Mr. 'Swits, and told him about the property; that a week thereafter he saw Mr. Tuck at Mr. Swits\u2019 office, then called on the defendant, told him the contract was ready for execution, and to come to Mr. Swits\u2019 office, and sign it, which he did. There is no claim or assertion in the plaintiff\u2019s evidence that he was instrumental in procuring the customer, other than may be imagined between the lines of this meager statement. On the other hand, the plaintiff produced another witness,\u2014-Henry G. MacBeth,\u2014who testified that he saw the defendant in relation to the purchase of the prop<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>erty in question, having received from Mr. Swits the information that the property was for sale; that he went with Mr. Tuck to look at the property, and then went with him to Mr. Swits\u2019 office, where the contract was signed. He further testified that he brought the purchaser, Katherine Kohler, to Mr. Swits, and that he submitted the property to her and to her attorney, Mr. Tuck. In addition to the evidence stated, the case contains this admission: \u201cIt is admitted by plaintiff! that the witness MacBeth obtained Miss Kohler to buy the property in question at the request of the plaintiff.\u201d This important fact is not admitted by the defendant, nor is it testified to by either the plaintiff or MacBeth. As an admission it is of no more value than would be an admission by the plaintiff that the defendant owed him the money for which he sues. MacBeth was asked on cross-examinatian whether he claims a commission on the sale of the property, but the evidence was excluded. He did, indeed, afterwards testify that he had never asked, or made any claim, for a commission, excepting that one day on the street he asked the defendant\u2019s attorney about paying his commission on the sale of the property through the plaintiff, from which statement some inference, perhaps, may be deduced in support of the theory that he did what he did at the request and for the benefit of the plaintiff. But of direct proof on that subject the case is bare. The rule governing the plaintiff\u2019s claim is stated by Judge Earl in Wylie v. Bank, 61 N. Y. 415, at page 416:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-4\">\u201cBefore the broker can be said to have earned his commissions, he must produce a purchaser who is ready and willing to enter into contract upon his employer\u2019s terms. Tombs v. Alexander, 101 Mass. 255; Barnard v. Monnot, *42 N. Y. 203. The broker must be the efficient agent or the procuring cause of the sale. The means employed by him, and his efforts, must result in the sale. He must find the purchaser, and the sale must proceed from his efforts acting as broker. McClave v. Paine, 49 N. Y. 561; Lloyd v. Matthews, 51 N. Y. 124; Lyon v. Mitchell, 36 N. Y. 235; Briggs v. Rowe, *43 N. Y. 424; Murray v. Currie, 7 Car. &amp; P. 584; Wilkinson v. Martin, 8 Car. &amp; P. 5. It is not indispensable that the purchaser should be introduced to the owner by the broker, nor that the broker should be personally acquainted with the purchaser. But in such cases it must affirmatively appear that the purchaser was induced to apply to the owner through the means employed by the broker.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">I do not overlook the fact that the plaintiff testified that the defendant, on the day the contract for the sale of the real estate was signed, promised to pay the plaintiff\u2019s commission. This evidence might be quite sufficient to support the judgment but for the proof furnished by the plaintiff through the witness MacBeth, and but for the plaintiff\u2019s failure to establish by his own evidence that he in any manner aided in effecting the sale. The promise must be assumed to have been made in the belief by the defendant at that time that the plaintiff had procured the purchaser. Notwithstanding his promise then made, the defendant is entitled on the trial to deny that the plaintiff did procure the purchaser, and to have his right to payment established by competent proof; and, where the plaintiff has made it clearly appear that the sale has in fact been effected by another, the promise cannot be relied on to overcome such evidence, and to control the result. The case must therefore be tried again.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-6\">Judgment and order of the city court of Mt. Vernon reversed, and new trial granted; costs to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
