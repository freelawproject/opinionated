The matter demurred to was pleaded in mitigation of damages, and was therefore not the subject of a demurrer. Under section 494 of the Code of Civil Procedure, only matter pleaded by way of counterclaim or defense in an answer can be demurred to. The order sustaining the demurrer will be overruled, and the interlocutory judgment vacated, costs of the appeal to appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-18\">As to the second appeal, we agree with the order made. Defendant\u2019s time to serve his proposed amended answer had clearly expired. The order should be affirmed, with costs to the respondent.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-19\">HASCALL, J., concurs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
