A clear case was made out for submitting the question of the defendant\u2019s negligence and plaintiff\u2019s freedom from contributory negligence to the jury; and there would be no difficulty in sustaining the judgment upon the merits, were it not that the record discloses several erroneous rulings which appear to have been prejudicial to the defendant, and which probably had the effect of materially increasing the amount of the recovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-19\">The complaint in this suit mentions the killing of the horse and the demolition of the plaintiff\u2019s wagon, but it contains no allegation that the plaintiff suffered any loss by reason of the destruction of the animal or vehicle. The only averment of damage relates to the personal injuries which the pl\u00e1intiff himself claims to have sustained. At the opening of the trial his counsel moved to amend the complaint by inserting an allegation to the effect that the horse which was killed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>by the defendant\u2019s negligence was worth the sum of $1,750/ and,that, the demolishedvcarriage, was worth the sum of $100. ; This motion yyas opposed in behalf of, the defendant on the ground that after bring-, ing this suit another1 action had been brought' by the plaintiff, through ' the same attorney, against the same defendant, to recover for \u00a1dam-,' ages to the liorSe and wagon; that ah answer ;had'been interposed therein! setting up t]h\u00a1e \"pendency of the, present! action, as a'defense; and that counsel was not ready to try. the question of the value of the horse and wagon herein, but would be taken by surprise.by any evidence on that subject - The court denied the plaintiff\u2019s motion to amend, but announced that it would allow; the plaintiff to recover the value of the horse and wagon under th\u00e9 pleadings its th\u00e9y! stood. When evidence was, offered to .establish, the\u2019 value of the animal, .counsel for the defendant objected on the ground that it was not receivable, within the pleadings'. \u25a0 The objection was overruled; and an exception\" was Taken. Counsel, th\u00e9reuptin asked \"permisbibti tq- withdraw a juror, upon the, ground'that he had had no sufficient notice to enable him to prepare to meet the proof in regard to the loss occasioned by the destruction of the horse and wagon. The court, which; , had-already intimated-that the defendant ought to stipulate-in the second action that the issue of' negligence ' should\" abide' the event in th\u00e9 present actidii, declined tq alloy? th\u00e9 withdrawal of a juror! and counsel for the defendant again excepted!, The court .declared that there was no surprise in the case, and, oyer objection and exception, received all the evidence offered by the.plaintiff in regard-to the-value of: the horse'and Wagon! We are of th\u00e9 opinion that this eyid\u00e9nce was \u2018not'1 admissible/- \u00fander the complaint! \u25a0'1 There was - n'\u00f3-\u00e1lleg\u00e1tion * that the -plaintiff- had stiffened any'loss by reason of- the destruction'of ? th\u00e9 horse and wagon; nor did the complaint-demand that ariy damages should be awarded on that account. Indeed/ th\u00e9 bringing\" of the second action by the samp, attorney indicated \u00a1thaf the pleader, did/not intend to include in this suit any claim for such damages.; In the absence of an amendment the proof should not have been received. It is. true that counsel for the. defendant objected to _ the proposed amendment, hut this was only on the ground that the .change in the complaint would operate to place him at a disadvantage by reason, of, surprise, inasmuch as he did qqt anticipate that any proof would he offer\u00e9d as.iq ,the value of the horse and wagon in this c\u00e1se. That, oh), jection did not prevent him from, insisting subsequently\u00a1that the evidence was inadmissible under the complaint,as it, s\u00edqqd. We;q.re.also, -of the opiniop!fhat afi;er ,the court had, concluded; ,fq! rqceiye this .evig \u2022deuce, whether an amendment was allowed or not, it should have granted tir\u00e9, .application of; thq defendant for, the yvithdrayvai; of, a j uror. hfotice that such applicatiqn'would!be made was given before the cas\u00e9, had! bpen qpened to the jury, by the .counsel for plainttfij. . hihe appliea-\" tian was equivalent to a! motion for the postponement pf the trial, and, the exception tallen by the defendant warrants us in reviewing, flip'.refusal of the cpurt to grant it, Bank v.

The effect of the errors already discussed might be obviated by deducting, from the amount of the verdict the $1,250 representing the value qf the horse and wagon,, if, it did not appear that another erroneous ruling in the case probably had; the effect of, .enhancing the sum awarded as compensation .for the plaintiff\u2019s personal .injuries, This ruling related to the plaintiff\u2019s ability to draw fancy pictures. His occupation, was that of a manufacturer., of carriages, \u201cMy business is .carriage, manufacturer,\u201d he .said. \u201cI have been in business in the'borough of Bropklyn, formerly the city of Brooklyn, as a carriage, manufacturer, for .about,.twenty years. I. have a.trade. I, am a draftsman and painter, and all connected with the business. * * I made drafts of carriages, and I worked at the bench,\u2014used the saw and, plane, and all those .tools connected, with a, mechanical business.\u201d. His testimony tended to show that he had lost the use of the fingers of his right hand in consequence of.the accident, so that he could no longer use a pencil or paint brush or pen, and that, he was np ,longer able to do any work as a draftsman .or painter,in connection with his, business as a carriage manufacturer.1 The testimony was proper for this purpose,, and. wholly unobjectionable.; .It, was supplemented, how-, ever, by the introduction of 26 pictures, on \u25a0 26 different small cards., The plaintiff testified that these were .samples,, of .work done by him, before the accident, that ,they.were just drawings that came info his, head, and that he could give counsel a wheelbarrow load, of .them, if he desired. To the court, he said, .\u201cI have got a wagon load more, if they want them.\u201d A book containing .other drawings of the same character was also admitted; the cpurt, holding that they .showed the cunning .of the plaintiff\u2019s right hand, which he said had been destroyed. These drawings were received; over, the objection and .exception of the defendant. They represent landscapes and other scenes, either copied from nature or the offspring,of the plaintiff\u2019s fancy, having no.conceivable relation to his business as a.carriage, maker.,,They offered no basis,for .any estimate, pf pecuniary. ,lpss\u201e sustained.,by. the plaintiff, in, consequence of his inability to produce similar sketches in the future; yet it is impossible, to avoid the conclusion .that the production and exhibition to the jury, of. these pictures, coupl.ed. with, the statement that the plaintiff could no longer:enjoy the,artistic satisfaction which he had formerly derived from thus using his, pencil, must, have had. an effect ,to. augment the verdict. As - appears from the record,., the learned, trial judge, entertained serious doubts as to \u00a3he admissibility of. this evidence,.,saying that&gt;he w\u00b0nid like t.o have time to reflect about\u00a1 it, hut, woujd. let.it ip, q$ counsel was willing to. falee, the risk. We .think ft. should have been,excluded. The extent, of the plaintiff\u2019s disability; was shown when it was. proven that he could not use a pen, pencil, or paint.brush,with,,his right hand, ,For all this he,was entitled to compensation. , Put there was no allegation in. the complaint, that. his disability debarred him from any particular pursuit aside tiom his usual.vocation, nor could specific,damages be allowed, therefor , unless, itr was a. pursuit in, which he earned money.

This is an action for negligence resulting in injuries to the person and property of the plaintiff. On appeal it is conceded that the evidence of negligence on the part of the defendant was sufficient to take the case to the jury, and there seems to be no reason to question the propriety of submitting to the jury .the question of the lack of contributory negligence on the part of the plaintiff,\u2014a condition of facts appearing from the evidence, which would justify a finding that the plaintiff had established his freedom from contributory negligence. The complaint, aside from the formal averments, alleges that \u201cheretofore and on the 30th day of June, 1899, while the plaintiff was lawfully driving upon Quincy street, and crossing Franklin avenue, in said borough of Brooklyn, one of the cars of the defendant, running at an unlawful rate of speed, unlawfully and wrongfully and negligently ran into plaintiff with such force and violence that his horse was killed, his wagon demolished, and that he was violently thrown from said wagon to the street and dragged for a considerable distance, whereby he was cut, bruised, wounded, and injured about the head, body, and limbs, his right knee was injured, he sustained a. serious injury to his head, his back was badly wrenched, and he sustained a severe nervous shock to his whole system,\u201d and \u201cthat, by reason of the aforesaid, plaintiff has been, and will be compelled to suffer great pain, and has been and will be compelled to spend money for medicine and medical attendance, and has been and will be prevented from attending to his usual vocation, and has been, as he verily believes, permanently injured, and that he will never fully recover from the effects of the same, in all to his damage in the sum of twenty-five thousand dollars.\u201d It is doubtful, except for the subsequent act of the plaintiff in bringing a separate action for damages for the loss, of the horse and wagon, if any one would have questioned the sufficiency of this complaint as a demand for all of the damages growing out of the one wrongful act of the defendant. It states concisely the elements of the plaintiff\u2019s\" damages, and fixes a sum which covers all of Ms damages. The trial court was not in error in refusing the motion to amend the complaint, and in holding that the pleadings were broad enough to admit of evidence of the value \u00f3f the horse and wagon destroyed.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-5\">The point urged by the appellant\u2019s counsel, however, seemed to be that he was surprised at the demand of the plaintiff for that portion of the damages growing out of the killing of the horse and the demolishing of the wagon. The defendant insists that it is entitled to some kind of relief. When the plaintiff brought a subsequent action for the damages to his property, the defendant, in answering, alleged the pendency of the action now under consideration as a bar to the second action; and it is conceded that under the rule in Reilly v. Paving Co., 31 App. Div. 302, 52 N. Y. Supp. 817, a recovery in the present action would be a bar to a recovery in the second action; that there is in fact but one cause of action. Recognizing this fact, counsel for the plaintiff moved at the opening of the trial to amend the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>complaint by inserting the words, at a proper point, \"and that the horse which plaintiff drove, and which was killed by the negligence of the defendant, was worth the sum of $1,750, and that the carriage which was demolished by reason of the premises was worth the sum of $400.\u201d This motion was opposed by the defendant, counsel urging ) that he was taken by surprise at being called upon to defend for the value of a horse alleged to be worth $1,750. Yet it was stated in the argument that after bringing the present action \u201can action was brought, suing us for $2,150 for the loss of this man\u2019s horse and wagon.\u201d To this latter action an answer was interposed, in which the pendency of the present action was set up as a bar. The learned trial court denied the motion to amend, but stated, \u201cI am going to allow them to recover the value of the horse and wagon if they prove it under the pleadings as it stands.\u201d Counsel for the defendant then gave notice that he should move to withdraw a juror on the ground of surprise. Counsel for plaintiff offered to stipulate that if the defendant would withdraw the answer in the second action, serving a new answer in which the pendency of the present action should not be set up in bar, he would refrain from introducing evidence as to the value of the horse and wagon. \u201cIf there is any surprise here,\u201d said the plaintiff\u2019s counsel, \u201che can withdraw his answer and serve me with a simple denial of the negligence. If you do that, I will not put in any evidence here on the value of the horse, and this jury need assess no damages on that subject.\u201d The court then suggested: \u201cAnd the damages for those two items shall be assessed in the other action if the negligence is established in this.\u201d To this, plaintiff\u2019s counsel assented, and the court suggested that it \u201cis a perfectly fair offer.\u201d Defendant\u2019s counsel then urged that, if the plaintiff was to be permitted to prove the value of the horse and wagon, the defendant be permitted to amend its answer and allege that there is a separate action to recover the damages which they seek in this action. To this the court replied: \u201cI am not going to allow them to amend. I \"am only going to try the case on the pleadings as made. Your adversary has made you an offer which I consider absolutely fair to you,\u2014 that you shall stipulate in the other action that the issue of negligence \u25a0shall abide the event of this. So that, if you get a verdict here, you have a verdict there, and, if there is a recovery here, that shall settle your liability in the other case for the horse and wagon, and <em>it </em>shall be a mere assessment of damages.\u201d Defendant\u2019s counsel declined the proposition, and the case went to trial upon the pleadings as they .were; the defendant objecting to the introduction of evidence as to the value of the horse and wagon. These objections were overruled, the court and counsel rediscussing the propositions stated above; and then defendant\u2019s counsel moved to withdraw a juror on the ground of surprise, which motion was also denied, and an exception taken. While it is a well-established rule of law that a single cause of action ' cannot be severed or divided in order that separate actions may be brought to recover damages for the various parts of what really constitutes one demand (Reilly v. Paving Co., supra), we see no reason why the plaintiff should be denied a right to recover in the present .action because his attorney made a mistake in his practice, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>'brought two actions instead- of; one. \" If the .present \u00a1action\u2019 btiuld he \u25a0plead\u00e9d as a! bar to the subsequent action (ahd there is:ao \u2018doubt*Of <em>this);' </em>and \u25a0 the defendant was \u00a1aware, of the claim- of the-plaintiff-in re- ' spect- to the -value of the -horse Sind--wagon-, it is hardly -in a position; -to \u25a0 urge' such- a surprise: upbn the- occasion 'of \u2018this-trial1 as-to justify the trial cduvt in permitting the .withdrawal'-of; a juror.
