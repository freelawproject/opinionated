It is contended on this appeal that the papers before the court on motion were wholly insufficient to warrant the order made, and we agree with such contention. The default sought to be opened was regularly taken at the trial term. On the motion the only paper used by the respondent was the affidavit of the attorney presented in obtaining the order to show cause, and, while the order recites that it is made on the pleadings, the record does not bring that before us on this appeal. Ho affidavit of merits was used on the motion. The order was erroneously granted, and must be reversed. See Deane v. Loucks, 58 Hun, 555, 12 N. Y. Supp. 903; Davis v. Soloman, 25 Misc. Rep. 695, 56 N. Y. Supp. 80.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-16\">Order reversed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
