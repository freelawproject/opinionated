Turtle, 31 App. Div. 49, 52 N. Y. Supp. 857. But that objection was not taken upon the hearing of the motion, and for that reason the defendant cannot avail himself of it here. The affidavits are sufficient to warrant the conclusion reached by the court below as to the right of the plaintiff to alimony and counsel fees, and the motion, therefore, was properly granted. The order should be affirmed, with $10 costs and disbursements.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
