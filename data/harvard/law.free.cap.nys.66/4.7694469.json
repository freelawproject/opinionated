That section reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b24-17\">\u201cWhere any building, which is leased or occupied, is destroyed or so injured \u2022by the elements, or any other cause as to be untenantable, and unfit for occupancy, and no express agreement to the contrary has been made in writing, the lessee or occupant may, if the destruction or injury occurred without his fault or neglect, quit and surrender possession of the leasehold premises, and of the land so leased or occupied; and he is not liable to pay to the lessor or owner, rent for the time subsequent to the surrender.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b25-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>The leased premises consisted of a main building having a width of 46 feet fronting on Broadway, near Granite street, in the present borough of Brooklyn. The lease was for three years, beginning on May 1, 1897. In November, 1898, a part of the building, which is described as having formerly been a bowling alley, and as being a kind of shed, 13 feet wide, collapsed in consequence of the weight of the snowfall upon the roof. After this accident the defendant refused to pay any more rent, on the ground that in consequence thereof the premises had become untenantable and unfit for occupancy, and he was therefore entitled to the protection of the statute cited. It is doubtful whether, in any view of the case, the damage was extensive enough to interfere with the occupation of the leased premises as a whole, but it is unnecessary to pass upon this question.' The lease expressly bound the lessee to maintain the premises in repair. The language of the instrument is, \u201cAll inside and outside repairs to be made by said party of the second part.\u201d This agreement is plainly broad enough to include the obligation to make good the disastrous effects of the snowfall under which the shed gave way. \u201cA general covenant is binding upon the tenant under all circumstances. If the injury proceeds from the act of a stranger, from storms, floods, lightning, accidental fire, or public enemies, he is as much bound to repair as if it came from his own voluntary act. Such has been the settled rule since the time of Edward in. If the tenant desires to relieve himself from liability for injuries resulting from any of the causes above enumerated, or from any other cause whatever, he must take care to except them from the operation of his covenant.\u201d Polack v. Pioche, 35 Cal. 416, 422. In the present case no such exception can be found, and it is clear that the effect of the covenant on the part of the lessee was to render the section of the real property law which authorizes a surrender when the leased property ceases to be tenant-able unavailable in his behalf.</p>\n<p id=\"b25-5\">It follows that the tenant was rightly held liable for the rent.</p>\n<p id=\"b25-6\">Judgment affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
