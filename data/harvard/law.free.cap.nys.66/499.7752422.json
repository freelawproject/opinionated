To admit this testimony was error. It wasi admitting paroi evidence which varied the terms of a written instrument. The release is general and comprehensive, and reaches every debt due from defendant to the plaintiff. To show by paroi evidence that it was not intended to release every claim that the plaintiff had against the defendant is to contradict the instrument. See Pierson v. Hooker, 3 Johns. 68. Judgment reversed, and new trial ordered, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
