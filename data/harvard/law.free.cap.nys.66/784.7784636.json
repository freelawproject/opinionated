Coe, dated June 10, 1886, was on the 11th day of September, 1893, admitted to probate in the surrogate\u2019s court of Chenango county; .and letters testamentary were issued to George B. Coe, named in the will as .executor. The will contains a bequest of $2,000 to the \u201cFirst Congregational .Church of Oxford, N. Y.\u201d On an Intermediate accounting the administratrix of William M. Coe, deceased, one of the' residuary legatees, filed an objection \u2022that this bequest is void, on the ground that there is no such person or cor\u25a0poration. The surrogate, on a hearing in which all persons interested In the \u25a0 estate appeared, found that the Associated Presbyterian Society In Oxford is the corporation for whom the bequest was intended by the testatrix, and is the .society designated in the will as the \u201cFirst Congregational Church of Oxford, \"N. Y.\u201d On the voluntary judicial settlement of the accounts of the executor \u2022 on October 16, 1899, the executor claimed that the legacy to the \u201cFirst Congregational Church of Oxford, N. Y.,\u201d is Invalid, for the reason that there is no such person or corporation, and objected to the payment of the same to the Associated Presbyterian Church of Oxford. The decree of the surrogate, entered on November 20, 1899, on the judicial settlement of the saccounts of the executor, ordered the executor to pay this legacy to the Associated Presbyterian Church in Oxford. From this decree the only appeal is by George B. ..Coe, as executor of the last will and testament of Sarah A. Coe, deceased.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b804-13\">Argued before PARKER, P.

The question raised by him before the surrogate and on this appeal is in respect to the validity of the bequest to the First Congregational Church of Oxford, N. Y. In that question the residuary legatees alone are interested, as they are the persons who are entitled to the moneys if the bequest is void. It is not pretended that the estate is not ample for the payment of the bequest, and, on the contrary, it clearly appears to be more than sufficient. The only question is, who are the proper distributees of this \u00a72,000,\u2014-the church or the residuary legatees? And in this question the executor has not the slightest interest. He is not aggrieved by the direction in the decree to pay the bequest to the Associated Presbyterian Church in Oxford. In re Hodgman, 69 Hun, 487, 23 N. Y. Supp. 725, affirmed in 140 N. Y. 421, 35 N. E. 660; Bryant v. Thompson, 128 N. Y. 426, 28 N. E. 522. The executor does not represent the residuary legatees on this appeal, and no individual right or claim of his is brought before the court. In re Hodgman, supra; In re Mayer, 84 Hun, 539, 32 N. Y. Supp. 850.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-5\">The appellant contends that the surrogate had no power, on the order to show cause made by him on the petition of the Associated Presbyterian Society after the intermediate accounting, to decree payment of the bequest to the church; the executor having filed objections denying its validity. The answer to this is that the surrogate\u2019s court did not, on such order to show cause, make the decree for payment. The court (whether correctly or not is not here material) held that the executor could not, at that stage of the case, produce evidence in regard to the issues raised by his objection; and the executor thereafter voluntarily filed his petition for a final accounting and rendered his account, and the decree for the payment of the bequest was thereafter made on the judicial settlement of his account.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-6\">The appeal should be dismissed, with costs and disbursements against the appellant. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
