The. action was tried before a referee. On the first hearing, both the plaintiff and the defendant being present and in hearing, and the referee having been sworn and about to proceed with the trial, it was proposed by the counsel for the plaintiff that the referee should charge for his services whatever he saw fit, to which the defendant then and there acceded. . The referee reported in favor of the defendant, and charged for his services more than $3 per day. The defendant paid the referee\u2019s fees on receipt of the report, the plaintiff having given no notice of his intention to recall his agreement.
