Case.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b122-10\">The complaint alleged that by the general custom of brokers and dealers in stocks in the city of New York, the words \u201c dividends or surplus dividends \u201d in the conti\u2019act, were intended to mean dividends declared on the stock, without regard to whether they had been announced before or after the date of the contract, provided that on the day the contract was made the stock was selling in the market \u201c dividend on,\u201d and not \u201c ex dividendthat at the time of the making of the contract a dividend of four per cent, had been declared and announced, and the stock was selling \u201c dividend on ;\u201d that on April <em>1, </em>1864, plaintiff called for and demanded the one thousand shares of stock, and also for the four per cent, dividend;. that the defendant deli<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>vered the stock, but refused to pay or account for the dividend, and plaintiff demanded judgment for the amount of said dividend, being $2,000 and interest. The defendant demurred to the complaint on the ground that it did not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b123-5\">Wm. Allen Butler, <em>for defendant.</em></attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b123-6\">Wright <em>&amp; </em>Prentice, <em>for plaintiff.</em></attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b123-7\">Sutherland, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ast\">It is very clear that the complaint does not state a cause of action independent of the general custom of brokerage alleged in it, for the complaint alleges that the dividend claimed was announced previous to the date of the contract, and by the contract the bearer was entitled to all the dividends declared \u201c during the time,\u201d that is, during \u201c six months from date \u201d of contract. Now, I am of the opinion that the plaintiff would not be permitted on the trial to prove the alleged custom, for the reason that effect could not be given to the custom without making a new contract between the parties. \u201c Six months from date,\u201d cannot by proof of any custom, be extended or explained to mean or include \u201c a day or two before date.\u201d Independent of this, it is very clear that the complaint does not state any cause of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-8\">The defendant does not, by the contract, agree to pay the bearer any dividend or dividends, or to collect or receive such dividend or dividends for the bearer. The contract simply declares that \u201c the bearer is entitled to all the dividends,\u201d &amp;c. There is not an allegation in the complaint going to show that there is any debt or duty on the part of the defendant relative to the dividend claimed. It is not alleged that he has received it, or in any way interfered with the plaintiff\u2019s right to it, as the transferee of the stock. The inference from the complaint, and from the contract set forth in it is, that whatever right the plaintiff has to the dividend, he has and was to have, as the trans<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>feree of the stock, and as incident of or to the stock. The complaint alleges that the defendant \u201chas never paid or accounted for the said dividend, but is still justly indebted to the plaintiff thereforbut the difficulty with the complaint is, that it does not state facts to show that the defendant is under a legal obligation or duty to pay or account for the dividend, or that he is indebted to the plaintiff therefor.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-5\">The defendant must have judgment on the demurrer, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
