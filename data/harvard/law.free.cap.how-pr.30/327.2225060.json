The fifth section of the act of 1865, fixes the amount of the stock to be issued, the rate of interest, and the time when payable ; and also the time when the stock shall be redeemable. This section further provides a fund for the redemption of the stock, and pledges the faith and credit of \"the city and county for. its redemption.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b333-6\">, The sixth section of the act directs the comptroller to issue the stock specified in the \"fifth section, within thirty days after being so required by the commissioners. This section leaves it discretionary with - the comptroller to determine the nominal value or amount of the stock\" per share, and the number, of shares of which it shall consist, and .only limits him in its disposition, to award it to the highest bidder, and \"not to sell\" it at a rate less than its par;value. The amount of the stock being fixed, the rate of interest -and the time when payable determined, the fund for the redemption of the stock provided, and the faith and credit of the city and county pledged to such redemption, nothing remains \"for the common council to do, and it would.be .the merest surplusag\u00e9 for that body to enact an ordinance .providing for the creation of a stock which is already provided for; and created by statute.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b333-7\">The remedy of the relators is apparent. Relying upon the- provisions of the fifth section of the act, they should demand of the comptroller a compliance with the requirements of.the sixth section, which makes it his duty to issue \u25a0the stock within thirty days after its issue is demanded by the commissioners. Should the common council enact an ordinance in the precise words of the fifth section of the act of \"1865, it'would add nothing toithe existence of \"the .stock.. The true construction of the fifth and sixth sections of the act of 1865, is to construe the former section as providing for the crea\u00edtion of a stock by the corporation, which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>is to be created by the comptroller's issuing the stock in obedience to the requirements of the sixth section.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b334-5\">II. The common council owe ho duty to the relators.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b334-6\">(a.) .It is an elemental rule that a party applying for a <em>mandamus </em>must show a clear legal right to have' the act done, the performance of which he seeks to enforce, and must establish a corresponding duty upon the part of those against whom the writ is asked, to perform the- act as required. <em>(People ex rel. Green </em>agt. <em>Wood, </em>35 <em>Barb. </em>653, 659, 661; 22 <em>How. Pr. R. </em>286.) . The provisions of the- act reli\u00e9d upon to support the order appealed from impose no duty upon the common council. The language of the act is, \u201c the mayor, aldermen, and commonalty of the' city of New York, are' hereby directed to create a public fund or stock,\u201d &amp;c., &amp;c. The duty is imposed upon the corporation, and; not upon the common council. - The common council is not the corporation, but only one of its constituent parts, and its member^ are merely the agents and servants of the corporation, hvhich is composed of all the citizens of the city. <em>(Clarke </em>agt. <em>City of Rochester, </em>14 <em>How. Pr. R. </em>193; <em>Lowber </em>agt. <em>Mayor, </em>5 <em>Abb. </em>329, 336; <em>Wyatt </em>agt. <em>Benson, </em>4 <em>Abb. </em>186.)

Stearns, <em>counsel for respondents.</em></attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b335-5\">This application is made under the act of the legislature, . passed at the last session <em>(Ch. </em>180, <em>Sess. Laws, p. </em>211), to compel the common council of the city of New York to create, by the passage of an ordinance to that effect, the $75,000 of \u201c market stock,\u201d provided by the 5th section of the statute. The respondents below read, no counter affidavits, and the application was disposed of on the showing made by the relators.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b335-6\">It appears by the moving papers, and was conceded on the argument below:</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b335-7\">1. That a proper demand had been- made on behalf of the relators upon the common council, for the creation of the stock, in the month of May last.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b335-8\">2. That no steps were ever taken by the said common council towards a compliance with the demand, save that the matter in both boards was referred to some committee.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b335-9\">- 3. That by the non-action of the respondents below, the work of the commission had been, and still was, greatly delayed and hindered.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b335-10\">4. That the property specified in the act as the site of th\u00e9 proposed market, was purchased in the name of the-corporation in -1857 for that purpose, at a cost of nearly $200,000, and by solemn legislative action dedicated \u201c to the use and purpose of a market;\u201d and that down to-the present time it has remained unoccupied and unproductive. <em>(See Lowber Case, </em>7 <em>Abb. Pr. </em>R. 158, <em>and proceedings of Aldermen and Councilmen, August 16th, </em>1856, <em>November 8th, </em>1856, <em>February 18th, </em>1857.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b335-12\">5. That the relators have no remedy except by <em>mandamus.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b335-13\">It was contended by the relators, and cannot be disputed with any sliow.-of reason, that the conduct of the common council showed\u2019plainly an-intention to defeat the purposes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>of the statute. That these <em>quasi </em>legislators were seeking by evasions and delays, to \"render the completion of the work within the time fixed by the statute impossible. That the facts as set out at ff., 11-15 Of the appeal paper, warrant the court in finding \u00a1a refusal. The learned justice at special term did so find. <em>(The Queen, &amp;c. </em>agt. <em>Commissioners of </em>Navigation, &amp;c. 8 <em>A. &amp; E. </em>901 ; <em>The Queen, &amp;c. </em>agt. <em>Vestrymen of St. </em>Margaret\u2019s, <em>Id. </em>889.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b336-5\">The various counsel for the common council conceded at,special term that the writ must issue unless the following objections were well taken: . \u2022</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b336-6\">1. No action on the part of the common council is required, the stock is created by the statute, and the <em>mandamus </em>should run to the comptroller, to compel him to issue the stock, if On demand he refuses to do it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b336-7\">2. The act says, the mayor, aldermen, &lt;fcc., shall create this stock, therefore the <em>mandamus </em>should run to the whole corporation.,</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b336-8\">. 3, The common council, <em>i, e., </em>the boards \"of aldermen and.councilmen being, legislative, and vested with discretion, cannot be compelled to vote in any specific\"way.</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b336-9\"><em>4. </em>The writ should run to the ppmmitfcees of the two boards, to whom the matter is referred.</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b336-10\">-I. It is \u25a0 conceded that the. legislature had the power to pass this statute and create this commission, for just the \u00a1purposes, and.in just the way it has done, save in respect of the .imposition of an obligation on the common council .to. do a particular thing. It is agreed that the cases <em>People </em>agt. <em>Draper, </em>15 <em>'N Y. </em>R..532 ; <em>Sill </em>agt. <em>The Village of /Horning, Id. </em>297; <em>Darlington </em>agt. <em>The Mayor, </em>28 <em>How.

R. </em>128, place the validity of this.law beyond question.</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b336-11\">II. We now claim that under the law as' thus established, \u00a1every one of the objections urged is set at rest. The supreme power in respect to the erection of this market <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>being in the legislature, they have the unquestioned right \u25a0 to select the means by which it shall be built. They can call in as many collateral agencies as may seem good, or employ but one ; they can order the -payment of the whole of these construction bills, in money realized immediately by taxation, or they can make the burden less heavy by providing for the issue of bonds. They can order the mayor : to execute those bonds, or any other official. -They can order unimproved property bf the city to be sold for the purpose <em>(per </em>Denio, <em>C. in Darlington </em>agt.. <em>The </em>Mayor, <em>supra), </em>and they can 'make it imperative upon any local - officer or body of officers, to perform any part, great or small, in the work proposed. It is no answer to this to say\" that in respect of other matters these local officers or bodies of officers, are vested with discretionary powers, for , here the\" legislature in \u2018the exercise of its acknowledged powers, has imposed an additional duty upon. them, in respect of which they are not vested with any discretion; ; in respect of which they are mere executive or ministerial &gt; officers, charged with a duty which they cannot avoid, <em>i. </em>e.,. the creation of this market stock,\u201d \", '</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b337-5\">III. We will now answer in the order stated,, the several objections:</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b337-6\">1. No action required on the part of the common council, &amp;c. It is plain upon a mere reading of section 6\u201e that the . comptroller cannot act. until the stock has been created, as provided in section 5. It is the stock mentioned in \"that, section, and none other, which he is to issue ; stock created as indicated in that section, and not by an act of the legislature. A fatal answer to an application for a writ against \u25a0 the comptroller would be : \u201c There has been no stock as yet created under section 5.\u201d . The legislature did not intend to create the stock; for they have commanded another body to do it in the section 5, <em>i. e., </em>the legislative department of the corporation, the common council. The 12th section of the \u201c Metropolitan Fire District \u201d law, is a precedent for a law. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>creating stock. . That commands the comptroller to issue bonds, and the majmr to sign them and affix the seal of the corporation. Here no such thing is done.or contemplated. The compilations of Judge Davies and Mr. Valentine, are full of precedents for the\" sections 5 and 6 of this law, and it is drawn according to the forms sanctioned by a\" usage of many years; and under these statutes, it has been the uniform practice of the common council to enact an ordinance creating the stock, and for the comptroller to \u2022 then perform the ministerial duty of issuing ih. Again, there are no words in the statute which give- any color for the argument in behalf of the common council; it \u2018does not purport' to create the stock; it pledges the .faith of the city for the redemption of the stock to be created under section 5. -\"</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b338-5\">2. The act specifies the corporation, and the writ should so run, <em>&amp;c. </em>This is a fallacy; upon whom could service be made, the mayor, the comptroller and the corporation counsel ? - What would be the answer to it ? The common council only can create the stock, and a writ should be-issued against them. And how can they be compelled to act? Only by a writ,- which by proper servicie, shall-take effect on them individually. They must each be compelled * by a mandatory process to vote in favor of the' proposed ordinance.' Is it the duty of this commission to obtain a \u2022 <em>mandamus </em>generally against the corporation, for the name used in the act is but the name' of the corporation ? (The. mayor, the common council and the comptroller, are not the corporation, nor are they all, when combined with other officials, the -corporation. Denio, C. J., in <em>Darlington </em>agt. <em>The Mayor.) </em>And then this corporation after going to the-court of appeals' on the question of the right to the writ, is, on being defeated', to resort to the same course in respect to the common council, to obtain the passage of the ordinance, upon which they go-to the court of appeals; then a like proceeding to compel the mayor to sign, with a like <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>, <em>litigation; </em>then the same thing in regard to the comptroller, in every respect; but what if at the outset, the corporation counsel should decline to sue out any of these writs ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b339-5\">1 Would not this commission be at last reduced to the neces- | sity,, notwithstanding -the proposition of the respondents, <em>\\ </em>to take these extraordinary proceedings against some divi-. sion of the city government ? and if that be true, then why not upon the immediate body whose willful perverseness is now attempting to defeat the purposes of the legislature,- and the wishes of the residents of the city ? - Do not courts seek to avoid circuity of action ? Then, upon the reason of the thing, the proposition is absurd. How stands it-upon authority ? This precise question was made on there turn to the alternative writ in <em>Commonwealth ex rel. Hamilton </em>agt. <em>Select and Common Councils of Pittsburgh </em>(34 <em>Penn, S. R. </em>496), carefully examined and utterly repudiated by the. court. So, the opinion of the court by Bronson, ,J. <em>(pp. </em>460, 461), in <em>McCullough </em>agt. <em>The Mayor of Brooklyn </em>(23 <em>Wend. R. </em>458), is decisive that the writ dies against the body upon whom the duty of \u201c putting the necessary machinery in motion,\u201d is imposed. So, <em>People </em>agt. <em>The Common Council of .Syracuse </em>(20 <em>How. Pr. R. </em>521), is strong, to the same point. There the act of opening the streets was an act of the corporation, but the common\" council was to set the machinery in motion, and accordingly the writ was issued against them. The earlier English cases upon these .topics are collected in <em>Archbold\u2019s Practice of the Crown Office, </em>239, 250, \u00e1nd <em>in Tapping on Mandamus (Law Lib. </em>N. <em>S. </em>142), 94.</p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b339-7\">But finally, the statutes of this \"state put this question at rest. Chapter 603, laws of 1853, section 5 <em>(Sess. Laws. </em>1853, <em>pp. </em>1135, 1136), provide that.no debt of the character contemplated in the'act under consideration shall be contracted, except by virtue of an ordinance passed by the common council of the municipal corporation, by a vote of not less than two-thirds. There are many pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>visions in that statute which cannot apply to this Case, but so much of the section as is here referred to, clearly applies. Of course, no one contends that the power to pass an ordinance creating this stock :or-debt resides anywhere in the corporate authorities but the common council. <em>(See Amended Charter, Sess. Laws </em>1857, <em>vol. </em>1, <em>p. </em>874, \u00a7 5.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b340-5\">\u25a0 3. But we are told the common' council is with a discretion, arid cannot be compelled to vote. The answer is, that in respect of this law they are vested with no discretion whatever, any more than the board of supervisors is vested with .a discretion in respeefto'the auditing of a bill for the salary of a county officer, fixed at a specific sum by law: Here the obligation is equally: mandatory.' The legislature has imposed a duty which does not involve . the' exercise' of any discretion whatever. The authorities are \u2018controlling upon this point. <em>{The People </em>agt. <em>Common Council of Brooklyn, </em>22 <em>Barb, S. </em>C.R.AOi; <em>Green </em>agt. <em>Common 'Council of Syracuse, </em>20 <em>How.

The observations already made are a complete, answer &gt; to the .suggestion that the writ should run to committees of the common'council. Those instruments of the common council cannot compel the bodies of which they are the servants, to perform a public duty. It is clear, in every aspect, that the order directing the writ to issue, should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b340-7\">Clerke, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AY8\">On the argument the only points. taken by the counsel for the corporation, were first, that no action-upon the part of the common council was necessary to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>creation of the stock in question; and second, that the common council owe no duty to the relators.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-5\">As to the first point. The act <em>(Laws of New York for </em>1865, <em>p. </em>211, \u00a7 5) directs and authorises the mayor, aider-men and commonalty of the city of New York to create a public fund or stock, to be denominated \u201c market stock,\u201d for the amount of \u00a775,000. Section 6 directs the comptroller of the city to prepare and issue <em>said </em>stock within thirty days after being required in writing so to do by the commissioners. What stock ? The said stock; that is, the stock which in the preceding section the mayor, aldermen and commonalty of the city of New York are directed to create. The comptroller evidently can prepare and issue no other stock than that mentioned in the 5th section; and any action relating to any other would be null and void, and of course, the stock would be utterly worthless.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-6\">As to the point that the common council owe no duty to the relators. The language no doubt of the act, as we have seen, is \u201c the mayor, aldermen and commonalty of the city of New York, are hereby authorised and. directed to create a public fund or stock,\u201d &amp;c. The words common council, do not appear in the act. The common council, however, constitute the only agency or instrumentality by which this behest of the supreme legislature can be obeyed. The mayor, aldermen and commonalty, can act in no other possible way in the premises than by and through the common council. They cannot compel the latter to do so. The mayor, aldermen and citizens generally, who, I suppose, constitute the commonalty, may daily raise their voices in the loudest tones to the honorable the common council, commanding them to create this stock, and the common council could laugh at them, as they have laughed at the commissioners. The only possible method by which the common council can be compelled to do so is by application to this court, which alone can issue a mandamus capable of being enforced.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>This point has been frequently determined by authority. In the language of Bronson, J., in <em>McCullough </em>agt. <em>The Mayor, &amp;c., of Brooklyn </em>(23 <em>Wend. </em>458), the writ lies against the body upon whom the duty of putting the necessary machinery in motion is imposed. In <em>The People </em>agt. <em>The Common Council of Syracuse </em>(20 <em>How. Pr. R. </em>491), the act of opening the streets was the act of the corporation, but the common council had to set the machinery in motion, and accordingly the writ was issued against them.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-5\">The obligation was mandatory on them. They have no discretion in the matter as in ordinary cases of municipal legislation ; they must obey-the supreme legislature. <em>(See also the Commonwealth </em>agt. <em>Select and Common Councils of Pittsburgh, </em>34 <em>Penn.

The statute imposes the duty of creating this stock on the mayor, aldermen and commonalty of the city of New York. This is the corporate title of the municipal corporation. They act by the common council and the mayor. No action of the one without the consent of the other, can enact the necessary laws for creating the public stock, except in case of a veto from the mayor. The mandamus directs the common council to enact the necessary law to create the stock. This they cannot do without the mayor, and they are required to do what is not in their power. I have no objection to a modification of the command in the writ, so as to require them to prepare and pass in their separate boards the necessary ordinance for that purpose, and on complying with that direction their duty in the matter is discharged,</p>\n<p id=\"b343-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>In <em>The People </em>agt. <em>The Common Council of Brooklyn </em>(22 <em>Barb. </em>404), the writ was so directed and allowed, but in that case the statute directed the common council of Brooklyn to do the act. So in the case of <em>The People </em>agt. <em>Common Council of Syracuse </em>(20 <em>How. Pr. R. </em>491), the statute directed the common council after the award to pay the money.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-5\">In <em>McCullough </em>agt. <em>Mayor of Brooklyn </em>(23 <em>Wend. </em>458), Bronson, J., said, the proper remedy was a mandambs against the corporation to exercise their functions according to law. Two things are necessary, the action of the common council and the approval of the mayor, before the law can be enacted.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-6\">If the writ had been directed to the corporation, it would have been their duty to pass the law; as it is, the remedy at best will be imperfect.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
