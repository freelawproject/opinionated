It left New York again about the first of May, 1864, and has not since returned to that city.

It is different with a corporation, but the \u201c Union Towing Company \u201d was not a corporation.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-8\">Chapter 482, of the laws of 1862, has application to canal boats. The first section is made applicable to seagoing or ocean-bound vessels, or to <em>any other vessel; </em>and its fifth subdivision includes, among other items for which a vessel may be seized, that of towing. Bo.uvier says, in maritime law, vessel is a ship, brig, sloop or other craft, used in navigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-9\">\"When a legislature in its enactments, distinguish between .seagoing and other vessels, the latter clause should be received in its largest sense, and be held to include all craft used in navigating any of the waters or canals of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>state. The case of <em>Maury </em>agt. <em>JVoyes </em>(5 <em>Hill, </em>34), was decided under the Revised Statutes (2 <em>R. S. </em>493), which only contained the words \u201c ships or vessels,\u201d and did not name \u201c towing,\u201d as one of the debts which might, be ere- \u25a0 ated a lien. The act of 1862 was a substitute for the Revised Statutes, repealing the latter, and its enlarged terms show a design to extend its benefits beyond the narrow construction given by the courts to the repealed statute. The third section of this statute requires the specification of lien to be filed in the office of the clerk of the county in which the debt shall have been contracted. This claim was for towing the canal boat Sidney S. Gross, from Troy to New York. The offer to tow the boat to New York was made at Troy, and there accepted, but no time of payment was specified, no payment made or negotiable . obligation given, and hence the money did not become due until the delivery of the boat at New York. The place of bargain was Troy, but the agreement did not become a debt until performance ; that was completed in New York; and hence, in a legal sense, the debt may properly be said, ' within the spirit and intent of said statute, to have been contracted in New York. A careful consideration of the statute will demonstrate this. A lien is given by said act against vessels for work done or materials furnished, for provisions or stores, for wharfage or keeping of vessels in port, for loading and unloading, and for towing. Some of these are matters which can only be performed or rendered at the port where the vessel lies, while others may be contracted for elsewhere to be performed at such port, to be paid for when performed.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-6\">If a vessel lay in the port of Albany, a contract for loading or unloading might be made in Troy, but could only be performed in Albany; while executory no debt was created, but when performed a debt would exist. So if provisions were contracted for in Schenectady to be delivered on board in Albany, or a wharf at Albany, con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>tracted for in New York to be paid for at Albany, or a contract by a steamer in the narrows of Richmond county to tow a vessel into New York, to be paid for on reaching port. In such cases the executory contract would be in one county, to be completed in another. Until completed no debt existed, and can there be a doubt that the legislature intended the specification to create a lien should be filed in the latter county. No purpose would be subserved by filing in Rensselaer in the one case, or in Schenectady, New York or Richmond, in the others. The intention of the legislature was to furnish a record where creditors and purchasers might seek for information, and in the counties where were located the ports at which such vessel had touched. That the legislature meant by the term \u201c the \u2022county in which such debt shall have been contracted,\u201d was the port where a contract was performed \u00a1or completed, and became a debt, not the locality where a bargain was made. In this view the specification was properly filed in the New York clerk\u2019s office.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-5\">The statute requires that to continue a lien a specification of the same shall be sworn to by the person having the same, his legal representatives, agents or assignees. The specification in this case stated that the \u201c Union Towing Company,\u201d composed, &lt;fcc., had a lien upon the canal boat Sidney S. Cross, for towing, &amp;c., and was signed C. T. Benjamin, agent. The proof of the agency of Benjamin was sufficient; as general agent he had the authority to sign such specification, it being an act in the business of his \u25a0 agency, and such signing was the act of his principal.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-6\">For enforcing the lien given by the act, it provides that any person having a lien may apply for a warrant to any officer authorised to perform the duties of a justice of the supreme court at chambers. In this case application was made to a justice of the supreme court, and the warrant granted by him. It 'is insisted that no authoritj\u2019- to issue such warrant is vested in a justice of the supreme court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>by the act, but only in such officers as are authorised by law to do what a justice can do at chambers. In this we differ from the learned counsel of the defendants, and hold that the authority exists with the justices of this court, equally with those authorised by law to perform their duties at chambers.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-5\">The bond sued upon seems to have been executed by all of the defendants; upon its face all are liable for such claim or demand as was established as due to the plaintiff. It was insisted that because Vincent, one of the sureties thereon, was objected to as not being a freeholder, held not competent for, that reason, and another surety, Day, after-wards added, the bond again presented and then approved, that Vincent is not liable thereon; but objecting to Vincent for insufficiency, even though it were sustained and another surety added, would not release Vincent so long as his name was on the bond when finally accepted and property released. On the trial the plaintiffs7 claim for towing was proved, the claim had been made a lien upon the boat, and was in force when the boat was seized ; it was released upon delivery of the bond in suit; its execution by the defendants was duly proved; the jury have assessed that claim at $101.06, and for that sum.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-6\">Judgment for that sum should be directed for the plaintiffs, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
