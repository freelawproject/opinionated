Judgment was entered for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>plaintiffs, and the defendants failed to appeal from the judgment, but appealed from the order entered upon the judge\u2019s minutes, making and serving a case in the usual form, to bring up for review the sufficiency \"of the evidence to sustain the judgment. This was a re-argument ordered on motion of the appellants.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b81-5\">Timothy Cronin, <em>for appellants.</em></attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b81-6\">S.

No qualification is imposed limiting the right to cases where the judgment has not been entered. This subject was considered at general term in the sixth district <em>(Pumpelly </em>agt. <em>The Village of Owego, </em>22 <em>How. Pr. R. </em>385). The right'to appeal was there upheld in a similar case to the present. On the next page of the same volume occurs the case of <em>Soverhill </em>agt. <em>Post, </em>decided in the third district, where a contrary rule was held, but as it seems to me on very insufficient reasons. The court consider the appeal in the latter case as nugatory, because the judgment will no.t be affected by the decision on the appeal, even should the verdict be set aside.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-8\">With great respect, I differ. Should the verdict be set aside, the special term, can, on motion, vacate the judgment, as it will then have no foundation. Where an appeal is taken from a judgment, and there has been an appeal also from a denial of motion for a new trial on the judge\u2019s minutes, we think it the better course to hear both appeals argued on the appeal from the judgment. By section 329 of the Code, all intermediate orders may be reviewed on the appeal from the judgment, and the facts as well as the law, may under such circumstances be reviewed.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-9\">The motion to dismiss the appeal should be denied, but without costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
