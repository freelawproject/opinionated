Clarke, on the 10th day of June, 1;862, at De Ruyter, in the county of Madison, knowing the same had .been feloniously stolen-from said Clarke., That indictment was feloniously destroyed by some person or persons unknown, while on file in the office of the clerk of Madison county, on the 10th day of May, 1865.

The court granted the motion, and made an order quashing that indictment which was found on the 12th day of June, 1865, as aforesaid, and discharging the defendant in error from further imprisonment and custody thereon. The district attorney sued out a writ of error for the review of the decision of the court of sessions, by which the indictment found against the defendant in error on the 12th day of June,- 1865, was quashed, and the defendant in error was discharged from imprisonment and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>custody thereon. The return to the writ contained a copy thereof, \"and a copy of the indictment so quashed, as aforesaid, and a copy of the order and decision of the court of slssions quashing such indictment and discharging the defendant in error, and also papers showing the finding and felonious destruction of said first mentioned indictment.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b329-5\">The case was submitted to this court upon printed briefs, by</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b329-6\">D. W. Cameron, <em>District Attorney, for the people.</em></attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b329-7\">S. D.

And the statute of 1852 only authorises the district attorney to; bring writs of error to review <em>judgments </em>rendered in favor of defendants in criminal cases <em>(Laws of </em>1852, <em>p. </em>76). There must be a <em>judgment </em>in favor of a defendant in a criminal case, before the district attorney can bring a\" writ of error in behalf Of the \"people to review a decision therein, though the effect of it be to discharge the defendant from further prosecution upon the indictment in the case. (See <em>People </em>agt. <em>Merrill, </em>4 <em>Kern. </em>74; <em>People </em>agt. <em>Nestle, </em>19 N. <em>Y. Rep. </em>583 ; <em>People </em>agt. <em>Hartung, </em>26 <em>Id. </em>154 , <em>People </em>agt. <em>Barry, </em>4 <em>Parker's Cr. Rep. </em>657 ; S. <em>C. </em>10 Abb. 225 ; <em>Dawson </em>agt. <em>The People, </em>5 <em>Parker's Cr. Rep. 118; </em>2 <em>R. S. </em>738, \u00a74; 19 N. <em>Y. Rep. </em>551.) When judgment is arrested, \u00f3r the indictment is quashed, or a <em>nolle prosequi </em>is entered in a criminal case, no judgment is given though the defendant be discharged, and the order and proceedings cannot be pleaded <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>in bar to a subsequent indictment for the same offence. <em>(Barb. Cr. Tr. </em>303; <em>13 Johns. </em>351; <em>Wharton's Am. Cr. Law, 2d ed. </em>190, <em>&amp;c.; Lindsay </em>agt. <em>The Commonwealth, </em>2 <em>Vir. Cases, </em>345; <em>Wortham </em>agt. <em>The Commonwealth, </em>5 <em>Randolph, </em>669 ; <em>Commonwealth </em>agt. <em>Wheeler, </em>2 <em>Mass. Rep. </em>172; 2 <em>R. S. </em>701, \u00a7 24.)</p>\n<p id=\"b330-5\">There would not be much danger of injustice being done to persons accused of crime, if the legislature should author rise district attorneys to review the decisions of criminal courts, by writs of error or otherwise, quashing indictments, or arresting judgments, or discharging prisoners without trial, except by <em>nolle'prosequi. </em>But unless such authority be conferred upon district attorneys, criminal courts should require prisoners to present defences by plea, or .in a way so that judgments may be rendered upon the indictments in cases of acquittal without the intervention of a jury.</p>\n<p id=\"Ao8\">\u2022 \u25a0 If the defendant\u2019s motion to quash the indictment in this case had been denied, as it might have been, upon the ground that he should present his defence by a plea of the statute of limitations (2 <em>R. S. </em>726, \u00a7 37; <em>Laws of </em>1860, <em>p. </em>474), and he had pleaded the statute, as he probably would have done, a judgment sustaining the plea could have been rendered, which the district attorney could have reviewed by writ of error under the statute of 1852.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-7\">\u25a0 It is inexpedient for this court to express an opinion upon the question whether the defendant could have been tried on the indictment against him that was feloniously destroyed, or as to whether the statute which declares that indictments except for murder, \u201c shall be found and filed in the proper court, within three years after the commis-. sion of the offence,\u201d unless the accused has been out of the .United States, &amp;c., was a defence, to the indictment that was quashed. <em>{See </em>2 <em>R. S. </em>726, \u00a7 37; <em>Laws of </em>1860, p.' 474.) We only decide' that the district attorney cannot review the decision of the Madison county court of sessions, quashing the indictment and discharging the defendant, by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>writ of error in Tbelialf of the people, and that such\" writ should be quashed \u00e1s unauthorised. And it is proper to add that we are constrained to make this decision; though the defendant\u2019s counsel has not questioned the right of the district attorney to review the decision-of the .court of sessions by writ of error.
