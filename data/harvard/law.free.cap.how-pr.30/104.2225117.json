True the language is not changed in subdivision 7, so far as this question is concerned, but at that time the only reported cases liad decided that the number of term fees in the court of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>appeals was not limited, and the legislature are presumed to have been acquainted with those reported decisions. Therefore, the fact that they did amend that section in other particulars, and did not change it in this, must be deemed a legislative interpretation of the section as it had been judicially construed. The cases cited by defendant\u2019s counsel had not then been reported.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-5\">Order appealed from affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
