ZIEGLER AND COMPANY\u2019S MOTION TO DISMISS (Doc. # 81), AND DISMISSING THE AMENDED CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR VIOLATIONS OF ERISA</p>\n<author id=\"b996-6\">C.N. CLEVERT, JR., Chief Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"AnM\">Plaintiff, Lisa Bosman, brings this purported class action against her former employer, Harley-Davidson, Inc., and various defendants as alleged fiduciaries of nine retirement plans sponsored by Harley-Davidson, Inc. The defendants include Harley-Davidson, Inc., the Harley-Davidson Motor Company Retirement Plans Committee, the Harley-Davidson Leadership and Strategy Council, Harold Scott, James Ziemer, James Brostowitz, Gail Lione, Joanne Bischmann, Karl Eberle, Jon Flickinger, Ronald Hutchinson, James McCaslin, W. Kenneth Sutton, Jr., Donna F. Zarcone, and Jeffrey L. Bleustein (collectively referred to as the \u201cHarley-Davidson defendants\u201d), as well as B.C. Ziegler and Company (referred to in the complaint at the Ziegler and Companies, Inc.).</p>\n<p id=\"b996-9\">This action is brought under sections 409 and 502 of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (\u201cERISA\u201d), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1109 and 1132. It was consolidated pursuant to Fed. R. of Civ. P. 42 with related cases filed against Harley-Davidson and the individual defendants.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Before the court are the Harley-Davidson defendants\u2019 Motion to Dismiss or in the Alternative for Summary Judgment (Doc. #80), and B.C. Ziegler and Company\u2019s Motion to Dismiss and Joinder to the Harley-Davidson defendants\u2019 Motion (Doc. #81).</p>\n<p id=\"b996-10\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b996-11\">A motion to dismiss under Fed. R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6) challenges the sufficiency of the complaint to state a claim upon which relief may be granted. The essence of a Rule 12(b)(6) motion is not that the plaintiff has pleaded insufficient facts; rather, it is that even assuming all of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"957\">*957</page-number>facts presented are accurate, he has no legal claim. <em>Payton v. Rush-Presbyterian-St. Luke\u2019s Med. Ctr., </em>184 F.3d 623, 627 (7th Cir.1999). Moreover, the factual allegations must be enough to rise above the speculative level, meaning that the contentions have to state a claim that is plausible on its face. <em>See Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 </em>U.S. 544, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 1974, 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007). This requires more than \u201clabels and conclusions.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1965. \u201cIn addition, a plaintiff can plead himself out of court by alleging facts that show there is no viable claim.\u201d <em>See Pugh v. Tribune Co., </em>521 F.3d 686, 699 (7th Cir. 2008) (citing <em>McCready v. eBay, Inc., </em>453 F.3d 882, 888 (7th Cir.2006)).</p>\n<p id=\"b997-5\"> \u201cThe consideration of a 12(b)(6) motion is restricted solely to the pleadings, which consist generally of the complaint, any exhibits attached thereto, and supporting briefs.\u201d <em>Thompson v. Ill. Dep\u2019t of Prof'l Regulation, </em>300 F.3d 750, 753 (7th Cir.2002); Fed.R.Civ.P. 10(c) (\u201cA copy of any written instrument which is an exhibit to a pleading is a part thereof for all purposes.\u201d). Any further pleadings would turn the motion into a 12(c) motion for judgment on the pleadings, or if additional evidence was relied upon or introduced, the motion would be converted into a 56(c) motion for summary judgment. <em>Thompson, </em>300 F.3d at 753. However, \u201cdocuments attached to a motion to dismiss are considered part of the pleadings if they are referred to in the plaintiffs complaint and are central to his claim. Such documents may be considered by a district court in ruling on the motion to dismiss.\u201d <em>188 LLC v. Trinity Indus., Inc., </em>300 F.3d 730, 735 (7th Cir.2002) (quoting <em>Wright v. Associated Ins. Cos., </em>29 F.3d 1244, 1248 (7th Cir.1994)).</p>\n<p id=\"b997-9\">Here, the Harley-Davidson defendants style their motion as one to dismiss or in the alternative for summary judgment. While they present multiple exhibits in support of their Motion that they consider part of the pleadings, <em>(see </em>[\u00b6] Defs.\u2019 Mem. in Supp. Exs. 1-24)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>, they wish to add evidence relating to Bosman\u2019s termination date and election to take distribution of her plan account. To this end, they tender a limited list of proposed findings of fact with evidentiary support pursuant to Civil Local Rule 56.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b997-10\">Bosman presents no opposition to the defendants\u2019 proposed findings of fact, which may arguably be considered part of the pleadings inasmuch as they go to Bosnian\u2019s employment and involvement in the plans that are at issue. <em>(See </em>Am. ERISA Compl. \u00b6 17.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>) Regardless, as discussed in this opinion, recent controlling authority undermines the defendants\u2019 arguments as to Bosman\u2019s standing to sue, for which they present the additional evidence (as conceded by the defendants). Moreover, the decision that follows will rest on Rule 12(b)(6).</p>\n<p id=\"b997-11\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b997-12\">Harley-Davidson, Inc. (referred to as \u201cHarley\u201d or \u201cHarley-Davidson\u201d) is a Wis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"958\">*958</page-number>consin corporation with its principal place of business in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. It operates primarily in two business segments: motorcycles and related products, and related financial services. Harley is the parent company for the group of companies doing business as Harley-Davidson Motor Company (\u201cHDMC\u201d), Buell Motorcycle Company (\u201cBuell\u201d), and Harley-Davidson Financial Services (\u201cHDFS\u201d). HDMC and Buell manufacture and sell motorcycles, as well as motorcycle parts, accessories, apparel, and general merchandise. On the other hand, HDFS provides wholesale and retail financing, along with insurance programs primarily to HDMC and Buell dealers and customers. (Compl. \u00b6 18.)</p>\n<p id=\"b998-4\">During the purported class period, which runs from July 1, 2004, to March 1, 2006, (Compl. \u00b6 5), Harley sponsored nine separate retirement plans, which the complaint divides into two categories. The first includes five contribution retirement plans (referred to in the complaint as \u201cSavings Plans\u201d), which the plaintiffs contend qualify as \u201cemployee pension benefit plans\u201d and \u201cplans\u201d under ERISA \u00a7\u00a7 3(2)(A), (3), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1002(2)(A), (3), as well as \u201cdefined contribution plans\u201d under ERISA \u00a7 3(34), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1002(3) and (34). Such a plan \u201cprovides for an individual account for each participant and for benefits based solely upon the amount contributed to the participant\u2019s account, and any income, expenses, gains and losses, and any forfeitures of accounts of other participants which may be allocated to such participant\u2019s account.\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1002(34). Investments in all five of the Savings Plans are commingled in the Harley-Davidson Retirement Savings Plan Master Trust. The assets of the Trust are allocated among the plans based on the participants\u2019 interests. <em>(Id. </em>\u00b628.) Harley-Davidson common stock constitutes approximately 35% of the total invested assets of the Savings Plans. <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6 84.)</p>\n<p id=\"b998-6\">Among the Harley-sponsored Savings Plans is the Harley-Davidson Retirement Savings Plan for Salaried Employees (referred to as the \u201cSalaried Employees Savings Plan\u201d or \u201c401(k) Plan\u201d). The Salaried Employees Savings Plan provides separate accounts for each participant. <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6 78-79; [\u00b6] Defs.\u2019 Mem. in Supp. Ex. 8 \u00a7 6.1.) They may elect to make contributions on a pretax basis, up to certain amounts but in no case more than 50% of their pay. (HD Defs.\u2019 Mem. in Supp. Ex. 9 \u00a7 4.1.) Participants are eligible for matching employer contributions based on the financial performance of HDMC. (Compl. \u00b6 82; [\u00b6] Defs.\u2019 Mem. in Supp. Ex. 11 \u00a7 4.8.)</p>\n<p id=\"b998-7\">During the class period, participants were offered nineteen different investment fund options and were permitted to choose as many or as few options as they deemed appropriate. (Compl. \u00b6 79; [\u00b6] Defs.\u2019 Mem. in Supp. Ex. 8 \u00a7 6.2; Ex. 12 at 10; Ex. 13 at 4; Ex. 15 at 10.) The Summary Plan Description (\u201cSPD\u201d) provides that the options are intended to give participants \u201can opportunity to choose from a broad range of diversified investment alternatives with materially different risks and characteristics that will permit you [the participant] to achieve a portfolio with characteristics that are appropriate for you while minimizing your risk through diversification.\u201d (HD Defs.\u2019 Mem. in Supp. Ex. 14 at 15.) The options included several mutual funds as well as the Harley-Davidson Stock Fund, which is \u201csubstantially fully invested in Harley-Davidson common stock.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>Ex. 15 at 12.) The SPD warns in bold caps that \u201cIT IS VERY IMPORTANT THAT YOU NOT PUT ALL OF YOUR RETIREMENT SAVINGS IN JUST ONE FUND \u2014 AND THIS INCLUDES THE HARLEY DAVIDSON COMMON STOCK FUND.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"959\">*959</page-number><em>{Id. </em>Ex. 15 at 14.) Further, Harley-Davidson matching contributions were invested in the Harley-Davidson Stock Fund and must remain there until the participant is fully vested \u2014 after three years. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 82-83; [\u00b6] Defs.\u2019 Mem. in Supp. Ex. 8 \u00a7 6.3.) After three years (or upon reaching age 55), a participant may elect to transfer all or part of those matching funds out of the Harley-Davidson Stock Fund. (Compl. \u00b686; [\u00b6] Defs.\u2019 Mem. in Supp. Ex. 8 \u00a7\u00a7 6.3-6.4.)</p>\n<p id=\"b999-5\">The second category includes four defined benefit retirement plans (referred to in the complaint as \u201cAnnuity Plans\u201d), which the plaintiff contends qualify as \u201cdefined benefit plans\u201d and \u201cemployee pension benefits plans\u201d under ERISA \u00a7\u00a7 3(2), 3(3), 3(35), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1002(2), (3) and (35). (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 31-32.) Among the Annuity Plans is the Retirement Annuity Plan for Salaried Employees (referred to as the \u201cSalaried Employee Annuity Plan\u201d). Investments into the Annuity Plans are commingled in a common trust arrangement known as the Harley-Davidson Master Trust (referred to as the \u201cAnnuity Trust\u201d). To become vested in the Annuity Plan, an employee must have five years of service with the company or reach the age of 65. (HD Defs.\u2019 Mem. in Supp. Ex. 2 \u00a7 1.18.)</p>\n<p id=\"b999-6\">The Harley-Davidson Retirement Plans Committee (\u201cthe Retirement Plans Committee\u201d) was the designated administrator of the nine retirement plans throughout the purported class period. (Compl. \u00b6 19.) In that sense, it was the \u201cnamed fiduciary\u201d under 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1102(a)(1). During the class period, the members of the Retirement Plans Committee (collectively the \u201cRetirement Plans Committee Defendants\u201d) included defendants Harold Scott, Harley\u2019s Vice President for Human Resources; James Ziemer, Harley\u2019s President and CEO; James Brostowitz, Harley\u2019s Treasurer; and Gail Lione, Harley\u2019s Vice President, General Counsel, Chief Compliance Officer, and Secretary. <em>{Id. </em>\u00b6 20.)</p>\n<p id=\"b999-8\">B.C. Ziegler and Company (\u201cZiegler\u201d), through its Investment Services Group, provided advice to the Retirement Plans Committee regarding the investment of assets of the Plans during the class period. <em>{Id. </em>\u00b6 24.)</p>\n<p id=\"b999-9\">Harley\u2019s Leadership and Strategy Council (\u201cthe LSC\u201d) is comprised of selected members of senior management from various areas within Harley-Davidson, and is alleged to have exercised supervisory authority over the Retirement Plans Committee during the class period. <em>{Id. </em>\u00b6\u00b6 21, 47.) The LSC makes high-level resource decisions, develops policies, and acts as an advisory group to the CEO. <em>{Id. </em>\u00b6 21.) During the class period, the members of the LSC included defendants Joanne Bischmann, Harley\u2019s Vice President of Marketing; Karl Eberle, Harley\u2019s Vice President and General Manager; Jon Flickinger, a Harley Vice President and CEO of Buell; Ronald Hutchinson, a Harley Vice President; James McCaslin, Harley\u2019s President and COO; W. Kenneth Sutton, Jr., a Harley Vice President; Donna F. Zarcone, Harley\u2019s President and Chief Operating Officer of Financial Services; as well as Ziemer, Brostowitz and Lione. <em>{Id. </em>\u00b6 22) The LSC defendants reported to defendant Jeffrey Bleustein, who was Harley\u2019s CEO until his retirement on April 30, 2005. After that date, the LSC defendants reported to Ziemer. <em>{Id. </em>\u00b6 23.)</p>\n<p id=\"b999-10\">Plaintiff Bosman began working for Harley as a manufacturing engineer on June 2, 2002. <em>{Id. </em>\u00b6 16; Thone Decl. \u00b6 3.) On July 3, 2003, she became a participant in the Harley-Davidson Retirement Savings Plan for Salaried Employees, (Compl. \u00b6 17; Thone Decl. \u00b6 4), and on July 1, 2004, she became a participant in the Harley-Davidson Retirement Annuity Plan for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"960\">*960</page-number>Salaried Employees, (Compl. \u00b6 17; Thone Decl. \u00b6 5). During the course of her employment, Bosman contributed $3472.51 to the Harley-Davidson Retirement Savings Plan for Salaried Employees. (Thone Decl. \u00b6 6.) In turn, Harley-Davidson contributed $842.92. <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6 7.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-4\">On June 15, 2005, Bosman terminated her employment with Harley-Davidson. <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6 8.) She elected to take a distribution of 100% of her interest in the Salaried Employees Savings Plan in the amount of $3934.63 on December 27, 2005. At the time of her withdrawal, Bosman had 100% of her contributions invested in the Harley-Davidson Stock Fund. <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6 9.) Because the Annuity Plan requires at least \u201cFive (5) Years of Vesting Service\u201d before acquiring a vested interest, Bosman had not obtained a vested interest in the Harley-Davidson Retirement Annuity Plan when she terminated her employment with Harley-Davidson after two years and thirteen days. <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6 10; [\u00b6] Defs.\u2019 Mem. in Supp. Ex. 2 \u00a7 1.18.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-5\">Bosman brings this purported class action on behalf of all the Harley-sponsored plans, herself, and all other similarly situated individuals who were participants or beneficiaries of any of the nine plans between July 1, 2004, and March 1, 2006. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 1, 13, 66-67.) She does not contend that she participated in any of the Harley-sponsored plans aside from the Salaried Employees Savings Plan and Salaried Employees Annuity Plan. <em>(See id. </em>\u00b6 17.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-6\">The factual assertions underlying this ERISA action are nearly identical to those that birthed the related consolidated securities action against Harley and its officers, which is also pending in this court. The complaint cites portions of press releases issued during the class period touting Harley\u2019s record revenues and earnings, as well as corresponding earnings conference calls. The public statements include projected earnings and shipment goals. <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6\u00b6 89-102.) In reality, according to the complaint, Harley was losing market share due to declining demand and increased competition. <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6\u00b6 102-04.) This was evidenced by the growing gap between motorcycle shipments to dealers and actual retail sales. <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6 105.) Further, HDFS reduced its credit standards in an attempt to boost sales. This in turn resulted in increased credit losses. <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6\u00b6 106-07.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-8\">On April 13, 2005, Harley issued a press release announcing that it \u201cslashed\u201d expected earnings and was cutting motorcycle shipments. <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6 114.) Specifically, it adjusted its previous forecast of \u201cmid-teens\u201d earnings growth to around \u201c5-8 percent\u201d for 2005. Further, its shipment target for 2005 was reduced from 339,000 motorcycles to 329,000, which was up from the 317,000 shipped in 2004. <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6 115.) Following release of this information, Harley-Davidson stock slid from $58.77 per share on April 12, 2005 to $45.42 over the next several trading days. <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6 10, 118.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-9\">According to Bosman, Harley\u2019s forecasts and statements issued prior to the April 13, 2005, announcement were false and misleading because the defendants knew or recklessly disregarded the \u201ctrue fact\u201d that demand for Harley products was declining. <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6 119.) Bosman\u2019s primary contention is that the defendants breached their fiduciary duties to the plans and the plan participants (and beneficiaries) because they \u201ccaused or permitted the plans and their participants to acquire and hold shares of Harley-Davidson common stock\u201d when such stock was an imprudent investment. <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6\u00b6 4-6.) Moreover, Bosman asserts: \u201cHarley-Davidson stock was imprudent for the Plans to purchase or hold for retirement savings because ... the stock was trading at artificially high prices <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"961\">*961</page-number>due to the Company\u2019s public statements as to motorcycle shipments and earnings growth, because the Company\u2019s statements were false and later restated.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6\u00b6 4-5,119-21.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1001-5\">Due to the defendants\u2019 actions, the plans suffered \u201cat least tens of millions of dollars in losses because substantial assets of the Plans were imprudently allowed to be put at great risk.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6 122.) In Bosman\u2019s view, such losses would not have occurred \u201c[h]ad the Defendants discharged their fiduciary duties ... including the provision of full and accurate disclosure of material facts concerning investment in Harley-Davidson stock and divesting the Plan from Company Stock offered by the Plan once maintaining such an investment became imprudent.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6\u00b6 125-26.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1001-6\">Bosman raises six overlapping counts of breach of fiduciary duty under ERISA \u00a7\u00a7 404 and 405 in her complaint. Count I claims a breach of the fiduciary duty of care under ERISA \u00a7 404(a)(1)(B), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1104(a)(1)(B) against all defendants. Here, she claims the defendants \u201cfailed to act prudently and failed to use reasonable care, skill, or diligence in offering Harley-Davidson Stock as an investment option, purchasing Harley-Davidson Stock for the Plan, making matching contributions of Harley-Davidson Stock, monitoring the Plan participants to diversify out of Company Stock, and communicating information concerning Harley-Davidson\u2019s financial performance to Plan participants and beneficiaries.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6\u00b6 133, 134-47.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1001-7\">Count II alleges a breach of the fiduciary duty to provide complete and accurate information under ERISA \u00a7 404(a)(1)(A), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1104(a)(1)(A) by all defendants. Here, Bosman contends that the defendants failed to inform participants and beneficiaries properly \u201cregarding Harley-Davidson Stock, Harley-Davidson\u2019s true financial earnings growth, the widening gap between Harley-Davidson\u2019s motorcycle shipments and actual sales by dealers, the reduction in credit standards by HDFS, and the consequent artificial inflation of the value of Harley-Davidson Stock.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6 152.) Allegedly, the defendants also failed to \u201cconvey accurate information regarding the soundness of Harley-Davidson Stock and the prudence of saving for retirement with Harley-Davidson Stock.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6\u00b6 153,154-60.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1001-9\">Count III charges a breach of duty of loyalty under ERISA \u00a7 404(a)(1)(A), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1104(a)(1)(A) against all defendants related to individual defendants\u2019 personal stock holdings. The claim asserts that the defendants faced a conflict of interest, which they did not resolve, and endorsed unreasonable growth estimates for Harley-Davidson. <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6\u00b6 174-75.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1001-10\">Count IV alleges a breach of the fiduciary duty to monitor and investigate under ERISA \u00a7 404(a)(1)(A), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1104(a)(l)(A)-(B) by Harley-Davidson and individual defendants Bleustein, Ziemer, and \u201cthe Council Defendants.\u201d Here, the defendants are said to have \u201cfailed to ensure that monitored fiduciaries had access to knowledge about the Company\u2019s true financial performance and growth prospects ... [and] appreciated the huge risk inherent in saving for retirement with Harley-Davidson Stock.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6\u00b6 185-86.) This court further charges that the defendants failed to take action to prevent the monitored fiduciaries from \u201cimprudently allowing the Plans to continue offering the Harley-Davidson Stock as a retirement savings option, and to continue acquiring and holding Harley-Davidson Stock when it no longer was prudent to do so.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6 186.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1001-12\">Count V asserts co-fiduciary liability under ERISA \u00a7 405(a), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1105(a) on the part of all defendants for knowingly participating in and knowingly under[tak<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"962\">*962</page-number>ing] to conceal\u201d breaches of other fiduciary duties. <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6 193.) And, finally, Count VI alleges \u201cknowing participation in a breach of fiduciary duty\u201d against defendant Harley-Davidson, Inc.</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-4\">For relief, Bosman seeks an order compelling the defendants to restore all losses and profits to the plans resulting from the defendants\u2019 imprudent decisions regarding plan assets, a constructive trust on any amounts the defendants were unjustly enriched, actual damages, costs, attorneys fees and other equitable relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-6\">The Harley-Davidson defendants move to dismiss the complaint, or in the alternative, for summary judgment, asserting that (1) Bosman lacks standing to sue because she is a <em>former </em>participant in the plans, and (2) that the complaint fails to state a valid claim for breach of fiduciary duty under ERISA. As to the former, the parties agree that Bosman was a participant in the plans when her complaint was filed, and it is undisputed that Bosman had terminated her employment and had cashed out her plan benefits at the time she filed the amended complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-7\">I. Standing</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-8\">Pursuant to section 502(a)(2) of ERISA, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1132(a)(2), \u201c[a] civil action may be brought by ... by a participant, beneficiary or fiduciary for appropriate relief under section 1109 of this title.\u201d In turn, section 1109 specifies liability for breach of fiduciary duties and remedies for such breach.</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-9\">Under 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1002(7), a \u201cparticipant\u201d is defined as \u201cany employee or former employee ... who is or may become eligible to receive a benefit of any type from an employee benefit plan which covers employees of such employer.... \u201d In <em>Firestone Tire &amp; Rubber Co. v. Bruch, </em>489 U.S. 101, 118, 109 S.Ct. 948, 103 L.Ed.2d 80 (1989), the U.S. Supreme Court further interpreted \u201cparticipant\u201d to include either \u201cemployees in, or reasonably expected to be in, currently covered employment,\u201d or \u201cformer employees who have a reasonable expectation of returning to covered employment or who have a colorable claim to vested benefits.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-11\">After the parties completed briefing on this matter, the Seventh Circuit issued its decision in <em>Harzewski v. Guidant Corp., </em>489 F.3d 799 (7th Cir.2007), in which it reversed a district court\u2019s conclusion (which the defendants had relied on for support) that the purported class plaintiffs lacked standing to bring the ERISA action. Similar to Bosman, the named <em>Harzewski </em>plaintiffs cashed out their 401(k) plans prior to filing their amended complaint. 489 F.3d at 803. The district court agreed with the defendants that the plaintiffs lost standing at that point because they no longer had a colorable claim to \u201cvested benefits.\u201d The court of appeals rejected that conclusion, noting that regardless of when or whether a plaintiff cashes out her benefits, a money judgment against her employer in the ERISA action could constitute the receipt of a plan benefit under 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1002(7). It distinguished this remedy from suits seeking \u201cdamages\u201d; any monetary relief must constitute \u201cbenefits\u201d to which the participant is entitled. Hence, \u201cthe plaintiffs must show that they are claiming an amount of money to which they are entitled by plan documents over what they received when they retired and received the money in their retirement accounts.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 804. It observed that a former employee is entitled to prudent management of the retirement account. <em>Id. </em>at 805; <em>see also Evans v. Akers, </em>534 F.3d 65, 70-71 (1st Cir.2008) (\u201cUnder ERISA, a participant is also promised that the funds in her individual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"963\">*963</page-number>account will be managed prudently by the plan fiduciary.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-5\">The parties have been diligent in notifying the court of relevant supplemental authority, and the defendants acknowledge that <em>Harzewski v. Guidant Corp., </em>489 F.3d 799 holds that \u201cformer participants in 401(k) plans have statutory standing to sue.\u201d Therefore, in light of <em>Harzewski, </em>Bosman\u2019s claims against the defendants for breach of fiduciary duties with respect to the Savings Plans will not be dismissed for lack of standing. <em>See also Rogers v. Baxter Int\u2019l, Inc., </em>521 F.3d 702 (7th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-6\">Interestingly, the defendants have also asserted that Bosman \u201cdoes not have any vested interest in the Annuity Plan because she only had two years, 13 days of employment, well short of the Annuity Plan\u2019s five year vesting period.\u201d (HD Defs.\u2019 Mem. in Supp. 11.) And, the plan documents attached to the defendants\u2019 motion specify that the \u201cvesting date\u201d in the Salaried Employee Annuity Plan is the \u201cfirst date on which an employee shall have completed at least five (5) Years of Vesting Service.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>Ex. 2 \u00a7 1.18.) Bosman states that she \u201cparticipated\u201d in the Annuity Plans, (see Compl. \u00b6 17), but she does not challenge the defendants\u2019 contention directly. However, because she makes little distinction between the plans with regard to the defendants\u2019 alleged breaches of fiduciary duties, and there are sufficient grounds to dismiss Bosman\u2019s complaint on the merits, further discussion on this point is unnecessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-7\">II. Failure to State a Claim</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-8\"> In general, \u201c[t]o state a claim for breach of fiduciary duty under ERISA, the plaintiff must establish: (1) that the defendants are plan fiduciaries; (2) that the defendants breached their fiduciary duties; and (3) that the breach caused harm to the plaintiff.\u201d <em>Brosted v. Unum Life Ins. Co. of Am., </em>421 F.3d 459, 465 (7th Cir.2005) (citing <em>Kamler v. H/N Telecomm. Serv., Inc., </em>305 F.3d 672, 681 (7th Cir.2002)). The defendants\u2019 motion focuses on Bosman\u2019s contentions that the defendants breached their fiduciary duties. Though the facts underlying this action are identical in many respects to those underlying the related consolidated securities action, allegations of breach of fiduciary duties and ERISA violations are generally subject to the more lenient pleading standards under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8. <em>See Pugh, </em>521 F.3d at 699; <em>Howell v. Motorola, Inc., </em>337 F.Supp.2d 1079, 1088-89 (N.D.Ill.2004) (discussing pleading standard in ERISA action and citing cases). Rule 8 requires \u201ca short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-10\">As discussed, Bosman\u2019s complaint is premised on charges that the defendants breached their fiduciary duties by continuing to offer and maintain Harley common stock in the plans at a time when it was imprudent to do so, in violation of ERISA \u00a7\u00a7 404 and 405. \u201cSection 404 of ERISA imposes a \u2018prudent man\u2019 standard of care on plan fiduciaries.\u201d <em>Pugh, </em>521 F.3d at 699. \u201cThey discharge their obligations to plan participants by acting \u2018with the care, skill, prudence, and diligence under the circumstances then prevailing that a prudent man acting in a like capacity and familiar with such matters would use in the conduct of an enterprise of a like character and with like aims.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1104(a)(1)(B)). Bosman claims the defendants could have satisfied their duty and avoided \u201cpredictable losses\u201d had they taken certain actions, including \u201cnot offering Company Stock as a retirement option\u201d and \u201cdivesting the Plans of Company Stock.\u201d (Compl. \u00b6 141.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-11\">The defendants first argue that they cannot be liable for any breach of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"964\">*964</page-number>duty relating to imprudent investment for failing to diversify inasmuch as the Savings Plans are \u201celigible individual account plans\u201d (\u201cEIAPs\u201d) under 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1107(d)(3).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> As EIAPs under 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1107(d)(3), the Savings Plans\u2019 fiduciaries are exempt from ERISA\u2019s duty to diversify as well as the percentage limitations on investments in employer securities. <em>See </em>29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1104(a)(2) (\u201cIn the case of an eligible individual account plan ... the diversification requirement ... and the prudence requirement (only to the extent that it requires diversification) ... is not violated by acquisition or holding of ... qualifying employer securities.\u201d); <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1107(b)(1); <em>Pugh, </em>521 F.3d at 699; <em>Wright v. Or. Metallurgical Corp., </em>360 F.3d 1090, 1097 (9th Cir.2004). These exemptions were put in place given that the very nature of EIAPs \u201crun[s] afoul of ERISA.\u201d <em>Wright, </em>360 F.3d at 1094. In the case at bar, the plan provides a Harley-Davidson common stock fund that is \u201csubstantially fully invested in Harley-Davidson common stock,\u201d all matching contributions initially remain in the Harley-Davidson stock fund, and participants may invest in the various options as they see fit. (HD Defs.\u2019 Mem. in Supp. Ex. 8, \u00a7 6.3, Ex. 15 at 12; Compl. \u00b6 83 \u2014 \u201cConsequently, due to the Company\u2019s matching contributions, each and every Savings Plan participant held Harley-Davidson Stock in his or her Savings Plan account during the Class Period.\u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-4\">However, as a general matter, \u201cERISA\u2019s prudence requirement continues to apply to an EIAP\u2019s fiduciaries.\u201d <em>Wright, </em>360 F.3d at 1097; <em>see generally Armstrong v. LaSalle Bank National Ass\u2019n, </em>446 F.3d 728, 732 (7th Cir.2006) (noting that \u201cabsence of any general such duty [to diversify] from the ESOP setting does not eliminate the trustee\u2019s duty of prudence\u201d); <em>Summers v. State Street Bank &amp; Trust Co., </em>453 F.3d 404 (7th Cir.2006); <em>Steinman v. Hicks, </em>352 F.3d 1101, 1106 (7th Cir.2003). Under these circumstances, courts have applied a deferential standard in favor of fiduciaries investing in company securities. <em>See e.g., Edgar v. Avaya, </em>503 F.3d 340 (3rd Cir.2007); <em>Wright, </em>360 F.3d at 1097; <em>Moench v. Robertson, </em>62 F.3d 553 (3d Cir.1995); <em>Kuper v. Iovenko, </em>66 F.3d 1447, 1457 (6th Cir.1995). <em>But see Smith v. Delta Air Lines, Inc., </em>422 F.Supp.2d 1310, 1331 (N.D.Ga.2006) <em>(\u201cMoench\u2019s </em>holding defies \u00a7 1104(a)(2), mandating diversification in certain circumstances even though ERISA plainly excuses it.\u201d). The Ninth Circuit, relying on <em>Moench v. Robertson, </em>62 F.3d 553 (3d Cir.1995), described the standard:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1004-8\">Under this standard, an EIAP fiduciary who invests in employer stock is presumed to have acted consistently with ERISA; however, a plaintiff may overcome this presumption by showing that the fiduciary abused his or her discretion. To rebut the presumption, \u201cthe plaintiff must show that the ERISA fiduciary could not have believed reasonably that continued adherence to the [plan\u2019s terms] was in keeping with the settlor\u2019s expectations of how a prudent trustee would operate.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1004-9\"><em>Wright, </em>360 F.3d at 1098 (quoting <em>Moench, </em>62 F.3d at 571). In other words, \u201cthe plaintiff must show that the ERISA fiduciary could not have reasonably believed the plan\u2019s drafters would have intended under the circumstances that he continue to comply with the ESOP\u2019s direction that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"965\">*965</page-number>he invest exclusively in employer securities.\u201d <em>Kuper, </em>66 F.3d at 1459.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1005-5\">It is true, as Bosman points out, that EIAPs such as the Savings Plans, differ from employee stock ownership plans (\u201cESOPs\u201d), and that courts applying a deferential standard have focused on the characteristics of ESOPs. <em>See e.g., Moench, </em>62 F.3d at 571-72; <em>Kuper, </em>66 F.3d at 1458. An ESOP is defined in relevant part as an individual account plan \u201cdesigned to invest primarily in qualifying employer securities.\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1107(d)(6); <em>see Summers, </em>453 F.3d at 410 (\u201cThe goal of an ESOP is to give employees ... a larger stake in the company\u2019s fortunes.\u201d) (citing <em>United States v. McCord, </em>33 F.3d 1434, 1440 n. 6 (5th Cir. 1994)); <em>Martin v. Feilen, </em>965 F.2d 660, 664 (8th Cir.1992) (\u201cCongress expressly intended that the ESOP would be both an employee retirement benefit plan and a \u2018technique of corporate finance\u2019 that would encourage employee ownership.\u201d). And it is true that the Savings Plans here are intended to \u201cencourage savings and to provide benefits to salaried employees of Harley-Davidson upon their retirement or earlier termination____\u201d (HD Defs.\u2019 Mem. in Supp. Ex. 8 \u00a7 1.1.) However, the distinction for present purposes does not change matters. Indeed, if the deferential standard exists to hold fiduciaries to a standard of prudence in light of the unique risks to participants, <em>see Summers, </em>453 F.3d at 407; <em>Kuper, </em>66 F.3d at 1457, despite tension with the specific exemption provided to ESOP EIAPs, the standard appears as applicable to the Savings Plans inasmuch as the plans permit participants to diversify their individual investments while the plans maintain the dedicated employer common stock fund options.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1005-10\">In <em>Edgar v. Avaya, </em>503 F.3d 340, a case strikingly similar to this one, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit rejected the argument presented by Bosman, and applied a deferential standard to the plaintiffs breach of fiduciary duty claims. In that case, the plaintiff, on behalf of a purported class, contended that defendants Avaya Inc. and its officers breached their fiduciary duties under ERISA \u00a7 404 by imprudently offering Avaya common stock as an investment option and failing to disclose material information to plan participants. 503 F.3d at 342. As in this case, the plans at issue in <em>Edgar </em>were EIAPs, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1107(d)(3), that included as an investment option a stock fund primarily invested in Avaya common stock. <em>Id. </em>at 343-44. Also like here, the charges in <em>Edgar </em>arose from the defendants\u2019 alleged false and misleading statements that caused Avaya stock to trade at artificially high prices; stock prices fell 25% after Avaya announced that it was adjusting its performance goals. <em>Id. </em>at 348. Following a thorough discussion of <em>Moench v. Robertson, </em>62 F.3d 553, and related cases, the court concluded that \u201cthe underlying rationale of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"966\">*966</page-number><em>Moench </em>applies here [to the EIAP and] <em>Moench\u2019s </em>abuse of discretion standard governs judicial review of defendants\u2019 decision to offer the Avaya Stock Fund as an investment option.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 347-48.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Further, in <em>Pugh, </em>the Seventh Circuit acknowledged the application of a deferential standard in such cases:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1006-4\">Here, we must be mindful of the delicate balance an ESOP fiduciary must achieve: he risks being sued for violating the plan if he diversifies but may impose unwanted risk on the participants if he doesn\u2019t. <em>Summers, </em>453 F.3d at 410. As <em>a result, \u201cthe plaintiff must show that the ERISA fiduciary could not have reasonably believed that the plan\u2019s drafters would have intended under the circumstances that he continue to comply with the ESOP\u2019s direction that he invest exclusively in employer securities.\u2019\u2019 Id. </em>(quoting <em>Kuper v. Iovenko, </em>66 F.3d 1447, 1459 (6th Cir.1995)); <em>see also Moench v. Robertson, </em>62 F.3d 553, 571-72 (3rd Cir.1995).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1006-5\">521 F.3d at 701 (emphasis added)<footnotemark>8</footnotemark>; <em>see also In re RadioShack Corp. ERISA Litig., </em>547 F.Supp.2d 606 (discussing facts very similar to this case, reviewing <em>Moench, Kuper, Edgar, </em>and <em>Wright, </em>then applying deferential standard to plaintiffs\u2019 breach of fiduciary duty claims).</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-6\">With this backdrop, the defendants submit that Bosman has not put forth facts demonstrating that the defendants\u2019 abused their discretion as fiduciar\u00edes in continuing to offer Harley stock as an investment. At the core, Bosman asserts that Harley was shipping to dealers more motorcycles than were being sold, and that HDFS lowered credit standards to boost sales. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 105-09.) In repetitive and conclusory fashion, the complaint asserts that these practices were intended to deceive the market and to cause Harley stock to trade at inflated prices. All of this led to the April 13, 2005, announcement that Harley was adjusting its shipment and earnings projections, which caused a 23% drop in the value of Harley stock over the next several days of trading. And, with the benefit of hindsight, Bosman contends the fiduciaries should have abandoned the structure of the Plan and barred participants from investing in the Harley Stock Fund at some earlier point.</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-10\">Stating a valid claim of imprudence under these circumstances requires more than allegations that there were gaps between supply and demand and a corresponding bad quarter. \u201cMere stock fluctuations, even those that trend downward significantly, are insufficient to establish the requisite imprudence to rebut the <em>Moench </em>presumption.\u201d <em>Wright, </em>360 F.3d at 1099. Similar to the situation in <em>Edgar, </em>such developments and the corresponding drop in stock price do not create the type of dire situation which would require defendants to disobey the terms of the plans by not offering the Harley-Davidson Stock <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"967\">*967</page-number>Fund as an investment option, or by divesting the Plans of Harley securities. <em>See Edgar, </em>503 F.3d at 348. Bosman\u2019s assertions are even more dubious given that the April 2005 stock price drop was in no way indicative of a chronic, deteriorating financial condition. <em>(See </em>[\u00b6] Defs.\u2019 Mem. in Supp. Ex. 1.) Harley had achieved record revenue and income for eighteen years before the class period, (Compl. \u00b6 95), it achieved record revenue and earnings for the years included in the class period, <em>(see id. </em>\u00b6 102; [\u00b6] Defs.\u2019 Mem. in Supp. Exs. 19, 22), and, following the April 2005 drop, Harley stock prices generally increased throughout the remainder of the class period, (HD Defs.\u2019 Mem. in Supp. Exs. 1, 24). <em>See Pugh, </em>521 F.3d at 701 (\u201cComparing publicly available stock prices to the allegations in the complaint allows us to conduct a hindsight analysis of whether it was in fact imprudent to continue to invest in Tribune stock.\u201d); <em>Edgar, </em>503 F.3d at 349 n. 13 (\u201c[B]are allegations of fraud and other wrongdoing set forth in Edgar\u2019s amended complaint are insufficient to establish an abuse of discretion.,..\u201d); <em>In re RadioShack Corp. ERISA Litig., </em>547 F.Supp.2d 606; <em>see also Delta Air Lines, Inc., </em>422 F.Supp.2d at 1331 (\u201c[M]ere decline in stock value, absent knowledge of impending collapse or some other impropriety, is insufficient under <em>Moench </em>and cases interpreting it.\u201d).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Hence, Bosman fails to adequately allege that the defendants acted imprudently by not discontinuing investment in the Harley-Davidson stock fund and divesting the plans of Harley stock.</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-5\">Further, Bosman\u2019s related claims that the defendants failed to provide complete and accurate information are without merit. These allegations, again in repetitive and overlapping manner, focus on the defendants\u2019 failure to disclose \u201cmaterial information\u201d with regard to Harley\u2019s \u201ctrue earnings growth,\u201d gaps between shipments and sales, and reduction in credit standards by HDFS. While it may be assumed that a fiduciary \u201cmay not materially mislead those to whom section 1104(a)\u2019s duties of loyalty and prudence are owed,\u201d <em>see Edgar, </em>503 F.3d at 350 (citing cases), Bosman does not contend that the defendants intentionally misled participants with regard to investment. Indeed, these claims appear to rely entirely on information presented to the market in press releases, SEC filings, and conference calls, which, via cross-reference in plan documents to Harley\u2019s SEC filings, were made by \u201cthe defendants\u201d in a \u201cfiduciary capacity,\u201d according to Bosman. <em>(See </em>Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 111\u2014 13.) However, such charges have been found insufficient to give rise to fiduciary liability. <em>See Stein v. Smith, </em>270 F.Supp.2d 157, 172-73 (D.Mass.2003) (\u201cMany of the statements alleged to have been lacking were made not by Smith, but by S &amp; W \u2014 e.g., press releases and periodic filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. With respect to these statements, no fiduciary liability can be implicated: these were statements made to the market in general, not to Plan participants specifically.\u201d); <em>see generally Baker v. Kingsley, </em>387 F.3d 649, 662 (7th Cir.2004) (\u201c[V]ague allegations of \u2018assessments\u2019 of the general economic well-being of an employer, especially in the absence of specific allegations of intent to deceive, are not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"968\">*968</page-number>sufficient to state a claim for breach of fiduciary duty under ERISA.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1008-4\">The SPD informed participants of the risks involved in investment, and that \u201cthere is no guarantee that any fund will achieve its objective, and a fund may lose money.\u201d (HD Defs.\u2019 Mem. in Supp. Ex. 15 at 10-14.) It also encouraged diversification, specifically warning participants not to put all their savings in just one fund, including the Harley-Davidson Stock Fund. <em>(Id. </em>Ex. 15 at 14.) <em>See DiFelice v. U.S. Airways, Inc., </em>436 F.Supp.2d 756, 788 (E.D.Va.2006) (\u201cThus, if, as in this case, a 401(k) plan offers participants a broad array of investment choices, one of which is a relatively risky option to invest in employer securities, the fiduciary should not be deemed to have violated any fiduciary duty for offering this option provided the investment in company stock remains viable, and the company has fully disclosed to participants the risks attendant in that investment.\u201d), aff<em>'d, </em>497 F.3d 410 (4th Cir.2007).

For whatever reason, the Harley-Davidson defendants have chopped up various documents and submitted different pages as different exhibits. For example, the pages of the \"Harley-Davidson Retirement Savings Plan for Salaried Employees (As Amended and Restated Through January 1, 1997) Includes Amendments Adopted December 21, 2002\u201d are submitted as exhibits 6, 8, 9, 11, 17. Overlapping pages of the Summary Plan Description are submitted as exhibits 10, 12, 14, 15, 16, 18. If the exhibits lined up in a coherent manner with other documents, such as the defendants briefs, this may make sense. However, this does not appear to be the case.

Under 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1107(d)(3), an EIAP \"means an individual account plan which is (i) a profit-sharing, stock bonus, thrift, or savings plan; (ii) an employee stock ownership plan; or (iii) a money purchase plan....\u201d There is no dispute that the Savings Plans are EIAPs. <em>(See </em>PL's Mem. in Supp. 6.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1005-7\">. The court rejects Bosman's contention that application of a discretionary standard is somehow inappropriate at the motion to dismiss stage. Indeed, court decisions in <em>Pugh, </em>521 F.3d 686, and <em>Edgar, </em>503 F.3d 340, stand in direct opposition to the Bosman's position. <em>See e.g. Edgar, </em>503 F.3d at 349 (\"Quite simply, if a plaintiff does not plead all of the essential elements of his or her legal claim, a district court is required to dismiss the complaint pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6).\u201d); <em>In re RadioShack Corp.

Some courts have referred to similar plans with multiple options for investment as having an \"ESOP component\" \u2014 in this case, the Harley-Davidson Stock Option. <em>See e.g., Smith v.

In reaching this conclusion, the court specifically rejected the argument that its decision in <em>In re Schering-Plough Corp. ERISA Litigation, </em>420 F.3d 231 (3d Cir.2005), relied on by Bosman in this case, required a different result. <em>See Edgar, </em>503 F.3d at 347 n. 12.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b1006-8\">. Though the <em>Pugh </em>court quotes from <em>Summers </em>and <em>Kuper </em>in discussing an ESOP, the plan at issue in <em>Pugh </em>was similar to the Savings Plans in this case. Participants had a choice of investing their money in one or more of ten different funds. <em>See Hill v. The Tribune Co., </em>2006 WL 2861016, *13 (N.D.Ill.2006) (\"Both Plans [at issue] are defined contribution plans that provide individual accounts for participants.... Nine of the funds are third-party, publicly-traded mutual funds.

Bosman\u2019s reliance on hindsight is put front and center as, without citation to any authority, she argues in her opposition brief that the defendants\u2019 imprudent administration is evidenced by the fact that Harley-Davidson stock \"underperformed the market by as much as 45 percent\u201d during the purported class period. (Pl.\u2019s Mem. in Opp. 2, 23 n. 16.) Such a comparison is meaningless for myriad reasons, which is probably why plaintiff is unable to direct the court to any supporting authority.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b1008-5\">. The parties apparently tie the success or failure of the complaint at this stage on B osman\u2019s prudence claim. The Harley-Davidson defendants assert that Counts II through VI do not provide independent grounds for relief, but rather depend on the establishment of an underlying breach of fiduciary duty. Because the prudence claim fails, the remaining counts must also fail as a matter of law, according to the defendants. (HD Defs.\u2019 Mem. in Supp. 20.) The defendants then summarily go through the remaining counts and provide case law in support of their position. In response, Bosman apparently agrees, arguing only that \u201c[s]ince the Court should sustain Count I, Counts II through VI should be sustained as well.\u201d (Pl.\u2019s Mem. in Opp. 25.)</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
