Leiter was plaintiff and the defendants in error David S. Leiter and others, including plaintiff in error <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>James H. Wallace, were defendants. On the date above named the. cause was tried and a judgment and decree entered finding and adjudging the issues against the said Wallace and in favor of the other parties, and making order of partition accordingly. Wallace gave notice of appeal. The court, believing the cause appealable, fixed the bond at one hundred dollars. Thereupon bond for appeal was duly given and the cause in form appealed to the circuit court. In that court the defendants in error interposed a motion to dismiss the appeal on the ground that the court had no constitutional jurisdiction to entertain the same. The court thereupon sustained the motion and ordered the cause stricken from the docket. James H. Wallace brings error.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b228-6\"><em>Messrs.

This section was amended April 20, 1904 (97 Ohio Laws, 113), which amendment provides for appeals and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>error to the common pleas instead of the circuit court, but that amendment does not affect the question before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-5\">The ground on which the jurisdiction of the circuit court is assailed is that the statute, as then existing, undertakes to clothe the circuit court of Richland and the other counties named in the statute with jurisdiction not conferred upon the circuit courts of the remaining counties of the state, and, in our judgment, the point is well taken. The constitutional provision applicable to the question is section 26 of Article 2, which is that \u201call laws of a general nature shall have a uniform operation throughout the state.\u201d It is no longer an open question in Ohio that laws which relate to the organization and jurisdiction of the circuit court are laws of a general nature, that court being established by the constitution, which, requires its existence in every county of the state, and that at least one term in each year shall be held in each county. Those courts, therefore, exercise a most important agency in the administration of justice, and necessarily have, within the limits prescribed by law, jurisdiction over the persons and property of the entire population. It would needlessly encumber the record to cite all the cases which justify, if indeed they do not compel, this conclusion, but attention may be called to <em>Kelley </em>v. <em>The State, </em>6 Ohio St., 269, the principle of which applies to the case at bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-6\">The circuit court did not err in dismissing the \u00e1ppeal, and its judgment will be</p>\n<p id=\"b230-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b230-8\">Shauck, C.
