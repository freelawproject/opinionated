That there must be' an increase of the risk in addition to the \u201cvacancy\u201d or other change in property, to enable the insurance company to avoid payment for the loss. <em>Insurance Co. </em>v. <em>Moore, </em>52 Ohio St., 607; <em>Insurance Co. </em>v. <em>Clark et al., </em>53 Ohio St., <em>414; Retterer </em>v. <em>Insurance Co., </em>55 Ohio St., 635.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b588-9\">The above cases settle the question beyond any doubt.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b588-10\">All these decisions support our contention that neither \u201cvacancy\u201d nor \u201cchange of occupancy\u201d will avoid the policy, that there must be in addition to \u201cvacancy\u201d or \u201cchange\u201d an increase of risk. Vacancy is not <em>per se </em>an increase of risk. Richards' on Insurance, 166; May on Insurance, 4th Ed., <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>Vol. 1, Sec. 249; <em>Becker </em>v. <em>Insurance Co., </em>48 Mich., 610.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b589-5\">In <em>Insurance Co. et al. </em>v. <em>Baldwin, </em>62 Ohio St., 368, \u201cpremises occupied and to be occupied by tenant as private dwelling,\u201d was held to be merely a description of the property and the court held that the question to be tried was whether the non-occupancy of the building increased the risk. In the <em>Insurance Co. </em>v. <em>Kiernan, </em>83 Ky., 468, the policy read \u201coccupied as a family residence\u201d and by a subsequent condition, the policy was to be void if the property became' vacant, held that this was' a representation as to the present condition, and an agreement that 'it would remain so, and was not material unless the change increased the risk. ' Their statute is similar to ours, and this case was cited- and approved by our Supreme Court in case of <em>Moody </em>v. <em>Insurance Co., </em>52 Ohio St., 12.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b589-6\"><em>Mr. I. W. Mooney, </em>for plaintiff in error in case No. 10099.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b589-7\">The question presented, by the court\u2019s charge is, does vacancy in itself avoid the policy, or is it necessary to allege and prove in addition to vacancy the hazard was increased by reason thereof. The trial court in its charge saw fit to follow the case of <em>Moody </em>v. <em>Insurance Co., </em>52 Ohio St., 12. The conclusion reached by the court in this case is violative of the established rules of interpretation, and is in direct conflict with the decision of this court in the case of <em>Insurance Co. </em>v. <em>Wells, </em>42 Ohio St., 519. In the case of <em>Insurance Co. </em>v. <em>Wells, supra, </em>this court held that a similar <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>stipulation to that contained in the policy sued upon was absolute and avoided the policy.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b590-6\">The policy of insurance sued upon in the case of <em>Insurance Co. </em>v. <em>Wells, </em>was issued, after the legislature had enacted what is familiarly known as the \u201cValued Policy Law,\u201d or Section 3643, Revised Statutes.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b590-7\">The case of <em>Insurance Co</em>. v. <em>Wells, supra, </em>being in direct conflict with the case of <em>Moody </em>v. <em>Insurance Co., </em>it becomes the duty of this court to affirm one of these cases and overrule the other. The statute then provides in the absence of any change, meaning thereby any change in the building itself, increasing the risk without the consent of the insurers, the insurer shall be liable for the face of the policy, in case of total loss. It is evident that the words \u201cany change increasing the risk,\u201d relates entirely to the physical condition of the building, and not to. occupancy, liens or mortgages.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b590-8\">The court in the case of <em>Insurance Co. </em>v. <em>Webster, </em>7 C. C., 511, construed Section 3643, and limited the words, \u201cany change increasing risk,\u201d to the physical condition 'of the building. The opinion of the circuit court in the above case was affirmed by this court in the case of <em>Webster et al. </em>v. <em>Insurance Co., </em>53 Ohio St., 558.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b590-9\">Section 3643 was considered by this court in the case of <em>Sun Fire Office </em>v. <em>Clark et al., </em>53 Ohio St., 414, holding that a stipulation contained in a policy providing the same shall become void if the assured should take additional insurance, -without consent of the company, is not within the provision of Section 3643, Revised Statutes.</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b590-10\">\u201e.

We heartily concur, in the dissenting opinion in the case of <em>Insurance Co. </em>v. <em>Russell, supra.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b591-5\">Proofs of loss must be furnished within the time provided by the terms of the policy^ unless waived during such time by the insurer. <em>Insurance Co. </em>v. <em>Lindsey, </em>26 Ohio St., 348.</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b591-6\">The uniform rule' is, \u201cthere can be no waiver unless at the time of its exercise, the right or privilege waived, was in existence.\u201d There can be no waiver of a right that has been lost. A waiver is an intentional relinquishment of a known right. 29 Am. &amp; Eng. Ency.

Bassett, Ir., </em>for .defendant in error in case No. 10099.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b591-8\">The trial court evidently decided in its mind two propositions before delivering the charge to the jury.</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b591-9\">1. There being no dispute as to the fact-of vacancy, that it was a question, of law for the court to say to the jury that it was .vacant,, and</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b592-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>2. That vacancy merely within itself- did not make the policy void, but only voidable to be determined by the question of whether or not the risk was increased by reason of the vacancy; and as to whether that risk was or not increased was a question of fact which must be submitted to the jury for its consideration and determination as evidenced by a part of the court\u2019s charge.</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b592-5\">It is apparent from the charge of the trial court that the court followed'the case of <em>Moody </em>v. <em>Insurance Co., </em>52 Ohio St., 12, and gave to the holding in that case the construction which we contend was the proper construction and settled law of Ohio. The policy in this case contains what is designated as \u201cvacancy clause.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b592-6\">There are numerous cases which take note of the necessity for construction of such stipulation in a policy in view of the variety of senses in which the word void is used. <em>Insurance Co. </em>v. <em>Burget, </em>65 Ohio St., 124.</p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b592-7\">Counsel for plaintiff in error in his brief undertakes to quote from the language of the court, speaking through Judge Spear, in the case -of <em>Webster </em>v. <em>Insurance Co., </em>53 Ohio St., 568, and quoting . from a part of a language adopted by Judge Spear as to the construction of Section 3643, Revised Statutes.</p>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b592-8\">We contend that this authority conclusively settles the question as against the position taken by counsel for plaintiff in error. The use of the property is a physical condition. It is a condition which can be seen when examined by the agent of the company. It is not one of record or one which would require the examination of records on the part of the agent, and in addition to that, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>the court in that case expressly excepts from the operation of the statute as being^ a change in respect .to incumbrances, and also it has excepted from' the provisions of the statute the obtaining of other insurance without the knowledge of the insurer and without his written consent.</p>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b593-5\">The claim of the plaintiff in error, and practically the only one urged is, that under the provisions of the policy that the mere fact that the property became vacant avoids the policy.</p>\n<p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b593-6\">Counsel for defendant in error further cited and commented upon the following authorities: <em>Insurance Co. </em>v. <em>Leslie, </em>47 Ohio St., 409; <em>Insurance Co. </em>v. <em>Hull, </em>51 Ohio St., 270; <em>Sun Fire Office of London </em>v. <em>Clark et al., </em>53 Ohio St., 414; <em>Insurance Co. et al. </em>v. <em>Baldwin, </em>62 Ohio St., 368; <em>Insurance Co. </em>v. <em>Drackett et al., </em>63 Ohio St., 41; <em>Retterer </em>v. <em>Insurance Co., </em>55 Ohio St., 635; <em>Insurance Co. </em>v. <em>Wells, </em>42 Ohio St., 519; <em>Insurance Co. </em>v. <em>Russell, </em>65 Ohio St., 230.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b593-8\">Davis, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A6Q\">These cases have in common one point, which is decisive of each case. In one of the cases the policy provides that if a building1 therein described, whether intended for occupancy by owner or tenant, be or become vacant or unoccupied and so remain for ten days, the entire policy shall be void, unless otherwise provided by agreement indorsed thereon or added thereto. At the time of the fire and for more than ten days previous thereto, the premises were wholly unoccupied without the knowledge of the insurer. In the other case the policy provides that if the premises described therein shall become vacant, unoccupied or uninhabited without written' consent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>thereon; the policy shall be null and void. The building described in the policy was not occupied when the fire occurred nor for a considerable time before. Both cases are therefore controlled by <em>Farmers\u2019 Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Wells, </em>42 Ohio St., 519, unless a change of occupancy amounting, to a vacancy is within the words, \u201cany change increasing the risk,\u201d occurring in Section 3643, Revised Statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-5\">So much of the section as is material to the present purpose is as follows: \u201cAny person * * * hereafter insuring <em>any building </em>or <em>structure </em>\u25a0against loss or damage by fire or lightning, * * * shall cause such <em>building </em>or <em>structure </em>to be examined by an agent of the insurer, and a full description <em>thereof </em>to be made and the' insurable value <em>thereof </em>to be fixed by such agent; in the absence of <em>any change increasing the risk </em>without consent of the insurers, and also of intentional fraud on the part of the insured, in case of total loss, the whole amount mentioned- in the policy * * * shall be paid, and in case of a partial loss the full amount of the partial loss shall be paid * * *.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b594-7\">This enactment was passed March 5, 1879 (76 O. L., 26), and the policy which was sued on in <em>Insurance Co. </em>v. <em>Wells, supra, </em>was issued a year and a half after the passage of this act and was clearly governed thereby, if the statute covers such a case. It is not discoverable, however, that any reference was made to the statute by counsel or court, at any stage of the case, through several years of litigation. Inasmuch as the able counsel and the judges of the several courts must be presumed to.have known of the existence of the statute, the inference is very strong that it was con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>ceded all around that the statute did- not apply to the facts of that case. Yet, since the reason for the silence of this court upon that point can only be conjectural, the question here still remains with us. The ruling in <em>Insurance Co. </em>v. <em>Wells, </em>however, stands unquestioned and unqualified, except inferentially in cases hereinafter commented upon..</p>\n<p id=\"b595-4\">Proceeding now to a construction of the statute it will be noticed that it first, distinctly and without any ambiguity whatever, provides what may be required by \u201cany person hereafter insuring any building or structure.\u201d Pie \u201cshall cause such <em>building </em>or <em>structure </em>to be examined by an agent of the insurer.\u201d It is not required that the examination shall extend to the uses, purposes and surroundings of the \u201cbuilding or structure,\u201d nor to ownership, incumbrances, possession of exposures of the \u201cbuilding or structure;\u201d for if we may go outside of the explicit language of the .statute for one thing, we may for all. The information to be acquired by such an indefinite and extended examination may be valuable, and even necessary, in some aspects of the contract of insurance; but the purpose of the statute is satisfied when the examination is limited to the thing to be insured, that is, the \u201cbuilding or structure,\u201d and when the insurer\u2019s agent has made a full description.and fixed the insurable value \u201cthereof,\u201d that is, of the \u201cbuilding or structure.\u201d Now we come to the latent ambiguity of the statute, an ambiguity which disappears entirely if we keep in mind the sole purpose of the statute, to fix a value on the. insured \u201cbuilding or structure\u201d which should be unquestionable in case of a total loss and without regard to any other controversies which might <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>arise between the parties to the contract. \u201cIn the absence of <em>any change increasing the risk </em>-vyithout consent of the insurers, * * * in case of total loss, the whole amount mentioned, in, the policy * * * shall be paid,\u201d says the statute. Any change in what? Manifestly, in the \u201cbuilding or structure\u201d which is insured and valued, because only that is the subject-matter of the- statute and of the whole sentence in which the phrase \u201cany change\u201d occurs. \u201cAll words of a general nature not express and precise are to be restrained unto the fitness of the Subject-matter or the person.\u201d <em>Steamboat Messenger </em>v. <em>Pressler, </em>13 Ohio St., 255, 262.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-7\">Considerations similar to these have led this court to hold that a stipulation in a policy that it shall become void by the taking of additional insurance without the consent of the insurer, and a stipulation that a policy shall become void if any part of the- property insured shall be incumbered by mortgage without the consent of the company, are not within the provisions of Section 3643, Revised Statutes. <em>The Sun Fire Office of London </em>v. <em>Clark et al., </em>53 Ohio St., 414; <em>Webster et al. </em>v. <em>Dwelling House Ins. Co., </em>53 Ohio St., 558. The ground of these judgments was admirably stated by Minshall, J., in the first case cited here, as follows : \u201cThis examination relates only to the physical condition of the property, and, therefore, by the ordinary rules of construction the general language immediately following should be limited to a change in such things as come within the purpose of the examination. So interpreted, they can mean no more than that, in the absence of any change in the physical condition of the property <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>increasing the risk the full amount of the insurance shall be paid in case of a total loss. If it had been intended to enlarge the meaning so as to embrace other matters made material by the terms of the policy, more apt words could and, as we think, would have been used. The language wo\u00fald have been so introduced as not to be naturally restrained by the context to a more limited meaning.\u201d But it was also said in that case that: <em>\u201cA </em>careful reading of the statute will disclose, as we think, a simple purpose on the part of the legislature to limit it to such matters connected with the physical condition of the property \u2014 its value, structure <em>and surroundings, </em>as might.have been discovered in the examination required to be made;\u201d and in the other case it was said by the judge who delivered the opinion of the court that \u201cthe change referred to in the statute relates to some physical change in the insured building, <em>its use or its surroundings\u201d </em>etc. See p. 568. Now, as we have already said, we see no warrant in the statute for extending its terms over anything else than the \u201cbuilding or structure\u201d which is the subject of'the insurance; and we think that we have demonstrated that the statute was not intended to include or apply to anything distinct from, or accidentally related to, the <em>corpus </em>of th\u00e9 insured building. We, therefore, think it unfortunate that these able judges did not speak on this subject with their usual close discrimination;\u2019 otherwise we might not have been called upon to review the subject now. Those cases, however, ended in proper judgments, as we think it must be conceded; and. if covenants such as those are not annulled by the statutes, where shall the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>line be drawn? It was.argued in the above' quotation from <em>The Sun Fire Office of London </em>v. <em>Clark, supra, </em>and in an opinion by Laubie, J., in 7 C. C., 511, 519, <em>et seq, </em>to which special reference is made in <em>Webster </em>v. <em>Dwelling House Ins. Co., supra, </em>that if it had been intended to enlarge the meaning of the precise words of the statute so as to embrace other matters made material by the agreement of the parties, it would have been more natural to have said so definitely and directly. That' seems to be sound reasoning, and if true, then the conclusion would seem to follow that the legislature <em>meant </em>what it said, and no more; and it would also seem to follow, conversely, that if the courts may stretch the words, from their obvious meaning of any change in the building or structure, to any change in the <em>occupation </em>of the building, then there is no limit to such judicial legislation as would eliminate every condition of the policy relating to title, possession, incumbrance, over-insurance, use, occupation, and the like. We can not think that the legislature ever intended, to be so interpret\u00e9d.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-5\">The courts below in both cases now before this court followed the case of <em>Moody </em>v. <em>Insurance Co., </em>52 Ohio St., 12. The reasoning in support of the final judgment in that case is peculiar and, it seems to us, unsatisfactory. On the point now under consideration, the opinion occupies less than a page and is, in substance, as follows: \u201cThe statute being in force when the policy was issued, became a part of the contract of insurance, and controls its construction and operation.\u201d It is undoubtedly true that the statute controls according to its intent and meaning. , \u201cThe condition of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>policy in regard to the occupancy is <em>therefore </em>so qualified by the statute, that, in the absence of intentional fraud on the part of the insured, to make the change from occupancy, to disuse or want of occupancy available as a defense, it must appear that the risk was increased.\u201d With all respect, we are unable to see that the conclusion follows the premises. <em>Insurance Co. </em>v. <em>Leslie, </em>47 Ohio St., 409, is cited to support the conclusion and we will examine it presently. The opinion continues: \u201cIt is well settled that the risk is not necessarily, or <em>prima facie </em>increased, by the insured property becoming vacant or unoccupied (citing authorities). And, <em>therefore, </em>when the insurer pleads such change as a defense to an action on the policy, the answer must allege that the risk was increased on account of it, unless the insured was guilty of fraud.\u201d That is the whole reasoning-, upon this point; and the last \u201ctherefore\u201d might be accepted as valid, if it had been first shown that \u2018such change\u201d was within the meaning of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-5\">We now take up <em>Insurance Co. </em>v. <em>Leslie, </em>47 Ohio St., 409, which seems to have been relied upon as the chief corner-stone of <em>Moody </em>v. <em>Insurance Co. </em>Since no reason was given for the ruling in <em>Moody </em>v. <em>Insurance Co, </em>except a reference to this case we have looked through .it carefully for some attempt to show that the words of the statute, \u201cany change\u201d mean any change whatever, in the broadest sense, instead of any change in the building or structure; but we have looked in vain.. The construction is dogmatically announced,\u201d p. 415, without any attempt at elucidation. After a-statement of the substance -of the statute, the- fot-. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>lowing unsupported declaration is made: \u201cIf, after the policy is issued there be any change <em>in the condition or surroundings </em>of the property which increases the risk, without the consent of the insurer, or, if there be intentional fraud on the part of the insured, these are regarded by the statute as matters of substance and may defeat a recovery on-the policy.\u201d This is substantially all of the opinion in the Leslie case on this point; and the syllabus is no clearer than the statute, for it is in the same language as the statute. It reads as follows: \u201cThe more effectually to- accomplish these results, the statute holds the company liable on its policy, unless, after its issue, a <em>change </em>occurs <em>increasing the risk \u2019\u2019 </em>etc. Against this we must place the same query which arises upon a reading,of the words of the statute. A change in what?</p>\n<p id=\"b600-6\">We have; been referred also to <em>The Milwaukee Mechanics\u2019 Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Russell, </em>65 Ohio St., 230. That case was decided on the points stated in the syllabus, all the judges concurring; but it must be apparent from the report that at least half of the members of the court did not concur in all-that was said in the opinion by Williams, J.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-7\">The citation of cases which have been decided upon the authority of <em>Moody </em>v. <em>Insurance Co., </em>is beside the question. The question clearly presented here is, whether, in view of Section 3643, Revised Statutes, <em>Insurance Co. </em>v. <em>Wells, </em>42 Ohio St., 519, controls these cases, or whether they must be decided according to <em>Moody </em>v. <em>Insurance Co., </em>52 Ohio St., 12. Our- conclusion is, for the reasons stated, that the law as stated in <em>Insurance Co. </em>v. <em>Wells </em>has not been qualified by the statute, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>and that <em>Moody </em>v. <em>Insurance Co. </em>must be overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-5\">\n<em>The judgments below are reversed and judgment for the plaintiffs in error.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b601-6\">Si-iauck, C.
