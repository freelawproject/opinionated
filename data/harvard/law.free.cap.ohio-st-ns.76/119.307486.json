In. his petition and the amendment thereto, he alleged, as and for his cause of action, that: \u201cOn the 8th day of May, 1902, plaintiff was in the employ of the defendant as a laborer, his work being that of a coal shoveler- on a coal barge in the Ohio River moored to the landing owned and operated by the defendant, and which is known as the East End Gas Works in said city of Cincinnati.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b162-6\">\u201cThat on said day, while shoveling coal as aforesaid with three fellow-workmen, under the directions and control of a foreman employed by said defendant, in the course of plaintiff\u2019s employment, he, together with the three fellow-workmen, was ordered by said foreman to lift and move a very large and heavy timber, known as a spar, that helped to hold in place the' barge on which he was working, which timber was much too heavy 'for four -men -to lift under the conditions then and there existing, and the lifting and moving of which was likely to injure them, all of which was well known to said defendant and its said foreman.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b162-7\">\u201cHe states that notwithstanding such danger, said plaintiff and his three fellow-workmen were\u2019 so as aforesaid ordered to lift and move said.spar by said foreman, and plaintiff, unconscious of the danger to him in obeying the order of said foreman, undertook, with said'three fellow-workmen, to faithfully perform the said task assigned to him, and in so doing, because of the great weight of the said spar, he was severely and permanently <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>ruptured, and rendered permanently and for the balance of his life disabled from performing any hard manual labor and from earning a living in any of the usual employments of a laborer. * * *</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"ACQ\">\u201cHe states that the said defendant wrongfully and negligently failed to furnish and provide sufficient help to lift the spar so as aforesaid lifted by plaintiff and three fellow-servants on the 8th day of May, 1902, under the order of plaintiff, as set out in the petition. And hq states that by reason thereof and of the facts set up in the petition he was injured as stated in the petition herein. * * * \u201cThe plaintiff, by reason of the premises, has sustained damages in the sum of $5,000, for which he asks judgment.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b163-4\">For answer, and as a first defense, the defendant, The Cincinnati Gas &amp; Electric Company, denied each and. every allegation in said petition contained, except the allegation that \u201cit is a corporation created under the laws of Ohio.\u201d' And for a further and second defense it alleged, \u201cthat if the plaintiff was injured as complained of in the petition, then that such injuries were the result of his own negligence and carelessness and not the negligence or carelessness of the defendant or any of its employes.\u201d To this answer the plaintiff filed no reply. The case was tried to a jury in the superior court, special term, and upon the conclusion of all the evidence the defendant requested the court to direct <em>k </em>verdict in its favor, which request was refused. Thereupon the cause was submitted to the jury and a verdict returned in favor of the plaintiff for $1,550. Thereafter, the defendant, The Cincinnati Gas &amp; Electric Company, filed its motion asking for a judgment on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>the pleadings, notwithstanding the verdict. This motion was overruled by the court, and the defendant thereupon filed a motion for new- trial. This motion was also overruled, a new trial denied, and judgment was entered upon the verdict. This judgment was affirmed by the superior court in general term. The Cincinnati Gas &amp; Electric Company brings error, asking that the judgments of the courts below be overruled, and that judg- \u2022 ment now be entered in' its favor by this court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b164-6\"><em>Mr. George H.

They are: 1. Was the defendant below, The Cincinnati Gas &amp; Electric Company, after verdict, entitled to have judgment entered in its favor upon the pleadings? 2. Is said company, upon the record here presented, entitled to judgment upon the undisputed facts?</p>\n<p id=\"b165-9\">The first of the above propositions must, we think, upon authority of <em>Lovell </em>v. <em>Wentworth, </em>39 Ohio St., 614, be answered in the negative. The first clause of the syllabus in that case is as follows: \u201cIf no reply is filed to an answer of new matter constituting a defense, but the case is tried without objection, as though such allegation had been denied, a demand for judgment on the pleadings after each party has introduced his evidence, is too late.\u201d In the present case the demand for judgment was not made by the defendant until after the verdict. The case was tried without objection, and as though the allegation of contribu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>tory negligence in the answer had been properly put in issue by a reply. By treating this allegation as if denied, and proceeding to trial upon the merits as though issue had been joined upon this averment of the answer, the defendant below waived its right to demand a judgment on the pleadings, and its motion asking that judgment be so entered was therefore properly overruled. <em>Lovell </em>v. <em>Wentworth, supra; Franc </em>v. <em>Nirdlinger, </em>41 Ohio St., 300; <em>Woodward </em>v. Sloan, 27 Ohio St., 592\u2018</p>\n<p id=\"b166-6\">2. Is the plaintiff in error entitled to judgment in this case upon the undisputed facts? We learn from the record, that the plaintiff below, Ben Johnston, had been in the employ of The Cincinnati Gas &amp; Electric Company as a laborer, for at least five years immediately preceding the 8th day of May, 1902, which is the day on which he was injured. His work was that of coal shoveler, and his place of work on coal barges in the Ohio River at the dock or landing owned, by the defendant company and known as the East End Gas Works in the city of Cincinnati. This dock or landing is located at the foot of an incline plane railway, on which, by means of cars, the coal is carried from the boats or.barges to the retorts of the company, where it is used. In unloading a barge it frequently becomes necessary to shift or move the same, in order that the coal may be taken out from different parts of the boat, and in this manner the weight on the barge be kept properly distributed. When a barge has been emptied it is necessary to shift or change its position so as to permit a loaded barge to take its place, and in removing the empty barge from its position next <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>the shore, it is necessary to handle and use a heavy timber or spar. .When a barge is emptied the workmen at once remove it, and in doing so are required to use this spar. The number of shovelers that were employed on a barge varied from time to time from four to eight or ten. On the morning, and at the time, when Johnston was injured there were four men on the work, and when they had emptied the barge on which they were working they proceeded to move it out into the river, using this spar. In handling or lifting the spar Johnston was injured. The only default or negligence charged by plaintiff in his petition against the defendant company is: \u201cthat the said defendant wrongfully and negligently failed to furnish and provide sufficient help to lift the spar so as aforesaid lifted by plaintiff and three fellow-servants.\u201d On the trial of this cause in the superior court, the plaintiff being called as a witness in his own behalf, testified as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b167-5\">Direct Examination.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b167-6\">Q. Mr. Johnston, you are plaintiff in this case? A. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b167-7\">Q. Where do you live? A. I live on Fourth street.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b167-8\">Q. How long have you lived in Cincinnati?A. Forty-two years I am here.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b167-9\">Q. How old are you? A. Fifty-five.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b167-10\">Q. Where were you employed on the 8th of May, 1902? A. With the gas company, in the East End; East End Gas Company.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b167-11\">Q. What was your employment there? A. Shoveling coal at-the river.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b167-12\">Q. In the bargees? A. In the barges, yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>Q. How long have you.been employed there? A. I have worked, off and on there, about five years.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-5\">Q. You mean before this accident? You haven\u2019t worked there since. A. No, sif; I have not worked any since, no, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-6\">Q. Five years before, at the same kind of work? A. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-7\">Q. Now, just explain to the. jury \u25a0 how this accident happened. A. Yes, sir; I was working, the day I got hurt I was working on the coal boat, not a barge, a coal boat; that would measure about eight feet in diameter, and the coal boat would measure twelve feet\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-8\">Q. You mean in depth? A. Yes, that is what I mean; twelve foot lift; that is what strained myself, lifting, it was twelve foot; it was not a barge; a barge is only about eight feet.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-9\">Q. It was a coal boat? A. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-10\">Q. Now, that was fastened to the bank with a spar, was it? A. Yes; that spar stands in between the barges, like this (illustrating), and when they want to get a barge out, one end of it you have got to raise up, so the barge can pass out, one end of it you have got to lift it up on the lashing (?) so the boat can pass under it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-11\">Q. How large was this spar about? A. Something higher than thirty-six feet long.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-12\">Q. And how large square? Well, maybe it might be about twelve inches, something like that, thick.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-13\">Q. Who was working on the boat with you at the time? A. Shepard Carpenter, John Holland and John Ryan.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>Q. Were you working under the direction of the foreman? A. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-5\">Q. Under whose direction were you working? A. Mr. George Henson.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-6\">_Q. What was George Henson\u2019s position there? A. He was the foreman.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-7\">Q. He is a white 'man, is he? A. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-8\">Q. Then you four men were working on the boat. A. Yes, sir; in the morning when we started we had five men, and we had a man that done the dumping, John Cain, and along about eleven o\u2019clock, a friend of his had died, on Eastern avenue, and he went to the funeral, so that left us only four men. And Mr. Henson said, \u201cI have been around, boys, to try to get other men; but you boys do the best you can. I want you to help me out.\u201d And I knowed what he meant. Well, when he went away, he said, \u201cI don\u2019t want you men to catch the spar until I give the word; when I give the word I want every man to catch .hold of it and lift what he can.\u201d And so the boys said \u201cAll right.\u201d And we caught hold of it, and I was the tallest man in the crowd, and I had my shoulder against it, and the boys had theirs, and it got so they could not reach it, and they had to step in front of me so they could reach it to lift it, and that left the end rest on my shoulder.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-9\">Q. What was the effect ? A. It broke the rim of my stomach loose.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-10\">Q. Ruptured you? A. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-12\">Q. Now, Mr. Johnston, tell the jury whether or not at any time prior to that, four men, to your knowledge, had undertaken to handle that spar? A. That spar? Well, from eight to nine men, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>just as many as could get-around it; but we didn\u2019t have only just we four men, that is, we hadn\u2019t only us four men lifting, and it is too heavy; but they could not get no men. Mr. Henson said he could not get nobody. He said, \u201cWe will have to try to do the best we could.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-6\">Q. What was the customary number of men used to lift that spar, Johnston? A. We generally have nine to ten men, and sometimes more than that; but I never knew them to go to lift it with four men. They generally have more than that; that is, along in the summer season of the year, the men was warm working up there in the house, the men working down there, and that left a shortage\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-7\">Q. Never mind that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-9\">Cross-examination.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-10\">Q. And you are fifty-five years old, you'say? A. Yes, sir; I am fifty-five years old; I have been a good stout man.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-11\">Q. And you say you worked for the Cincinnati Gas Company for about five years. A. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-12\">Q. Before this accident; before you got hurt? A. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-13\">Q. For five years? A. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-14\">Q. Had you been working at the East End Gas Works all that time? A. Yes, sir; but sometimes, when the ice bothered up there, I would come down here, and then I would go back up there.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-15\">Q. Well, were you working at .that particular <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>place, on that coal boat, or coal landing, all of that five years? A. Oh, yes, sir; that is, I didn\u2019t do any other work much around there; I always worked at the river.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-5\">Q. You always worked at the river ? A. Yes, sir; they always kept me at the river; I did about a half a day\u2019s work in the yard the whole time I was there.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-6\">Q. And all the rest of the time you were working right down here on this boat, right down at the river? A. Yes, sir; in the East End, worked most all the time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-8\">Q. What else did you do beside shovel coal? A. Which, down there at that time?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-9\">Q. Yes, for all those five years? A. Oh, outside, when I was not working, the rest of the time ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-10\">Q. No, when you were shoveling' what else did you do down there for tlie company except shovel coal? A. That is all, shovel coal; there was not nothing else for me to do but shovel coal.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-11\">Q. Did you ever handle that spar before? A. \u2022 Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-12\">Q. .Handled that a great deal before, didn\u2019t you? A. Yes, sir, we did a great deal handle it, but we had plenty of help, too.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-13\">Q. You had plenty of help? A. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-14\">Q. And it was part of the duty of coal shovelers to handle that spar? A. Yes, that is what we had to do.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-15\">Q. That was one of your duties? A. Yes, sir. \u25a0</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-16\">Q. And how long had that spar been there? A. I don\u2019t know; if was there when I went there.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b172-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>Q. It was there when you went there? A. Yes, sir. ' .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b172-5\">Q. You handled that spar for five years, didn\u2019t you? A. Yes, sir; off' and on.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b172-6\">Q. And how often would you\u201ehandle that? A. A day?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b172-7\">Q. Yes. A. Well, it would be pretty hard to tell.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b172-8\"><em>Q. </em>You would handle that every day? A. Yes, have to handle that every day.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b172-9\">Q. You had to handle that every day during all those-five years? A. Yes, have to handle it; you can\u2019t pass any boats up without.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b172-10\"><em>Q. </em>Was that a pretty heavy spar? A. Yes, pretty heavy; no mistake about that; it was pretty heavy timb\u00e9r. .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b172-11\">Q. And you knew that was heavy? A. Yes, sir. \u25a0</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b172-12\">\u2022 Q. You had handled it all that time? A. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b172-13\">Q. Do you know what it weighs? A. I don\u2019t know what it weighs, but I knew it was mighty heavy.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b172-14\">Q. And you knew that all the time? A. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b172-16\">Q. You knew that morning before you men got hold of it, it was going to be a pretty- heavy lift? A. Yes, I did; and I done my best.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b172-17\">Q. Was Mr. Henson standing by? A.- Well, Mr. Henson was standing in the coal boat, at the lashing, and every time it would give a little he would take up what he could and as quick as he could and fasten it up on top of the coal boat. When we would make a lift he would try to catch <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>it up. We would lift one end at a time, then when we would get one end up we would go and lift the other then.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b173-5\">Q. What time of day did this occur? A. It was along about between eight and nine o\u2019clock in the morning.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b173-6\">Q. What had you been doing before that in the morning. A, Shoveling coal down from the barge.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b173-8\">Q. When did Mr. Henson speak to you about doing this work, 'moving that spar? A. He speaks to us any time he gets ready- for us; when the digger gets on near you on the.boat and they can\u2019t go any farther, then you have got to move your boat up so they can dig.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b173-9\">Q. And you have been doing that right along for five years? A. Yes,'sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b173-10\">Q. And do you remember that he asked you to do that this morning, to lift it up; he told you to lift it up? A. That is right, yes, sir; Mr. Henson told us that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b173-11\">Q. Where was he when he told you that? A. Up on top of the coal boat, right up on top.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b173-12\">Q. And he called to you to go ahead and do that? A. Yes, sir, and he done sent us off the boat up there to lift it; we walked .up ahead of him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b173-13\">Q. And he told you to do it? A. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b173-14\">Q. And you four started off to do it? A. Yes, isir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b173-15\">Q. Like you had done it many times before? A.

If the boss told me to do anything I just go and try it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b174-6\">Q. But you made no protest to him? A. No, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b174-7\">Q. Now, what kind of a man is Mr. Henson? A. I don\u2019t think there is a better boss man on the Ohio River than Mr. Henson.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b174-8\">Q. Is he a tyrannical man? No, sir; nothing like that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b174-10\">Q. And he never told you to do the work, and if you don\u2019t want to do it, to get out of the job, did he? A. No, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b174-11\">Q. He never talked that way? A. No, sir; never talks that way; I never knowed him to talk that way.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b174-13\">Q. Were any of the other three men who helped you lift that weight injured? A. Not that I know of.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b174-14\">Q. As far as you know, they were not? A. No, sir; I don\u2019t think they were.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ath\">Q. Are they still working for the gas company? A. Yes, still working there yet.

Counsel for defendant in error say in their brief that these facts \u201cmake the case of <em>The Van Duzen Gas &amp; Gasoline Engine Co. </em>v. <em>Schelies, </em>61 Ohio St., 298, perfectly applicable, and it is upon the law as laid down in that case that we rely for the affirmation of the judgments below, and we do not believe it necessary to make any further discussion of the law than a reference to that case.\u201d It would seem also that the view taken by both the courts below was, that the present case, upon its facts, \u2019is governed and controlled by the rule of law as declared by this court in the above case. In this view we do not concur. The rule announced in the Van Duzen case is not one to be applied indiscriminately 'to all kinds and classes of so-called negligence cases, but, that it may not be put in conflict with certain well established and universally recognized principles of the law governing the relation of master and. servant, must be limited in its application to those cases, which, because of their particular facts, fall within the class of cases to which the Van Duzen case belongs; namely, cases in which the master or his representative, having superior knowledge of a given situation,- assures the servant he can safely undertake a particular work which he is asked to perform, and which, in reliance upon the superior knowledge of the master he therefore undertakes. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>Or, cases where the master, or one in authority over the servant, peremptorily orders him to do a particular work, apparently dangerous, yet such as a reasonably prudent person, acting under the influence or restraint of such an order, might in obedience thereto properly undertake to perform.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-4\">The facts in that case were substantially as follows: Schelies, the servant, at the time the injury occurred was in the employ of the Van Duzen Gas &amp; Gasoline Engine Company as a \u201cvise hand.\u201d He was, in an emergency, called by the foreman from his usual and customary employment to assist in the adjustment of a pump shaft on a pump attached to a gasoline engine, near which at the time was a circular saw then in motion. This saw, by the culpable negligence of the company, was not protected. The shafting which he was ordered to adjust was close, and next to, this revolving saw. Schelies when ordered to perform this service protested, and suggested to the foreman that it was not safe to attempt to do so without first stopping the saw. Thereupon the foreman peremptorily renewed his order, commanding Schelies to proceed with the work. He obeyed this order, using ordinary care, but his clothing was caught by the saw, he was drawn over and on to it, and was thereby seriously injured. Upon these facts and under these circumstances it was held, that what passed between the master and the servant should be held to operate as a transfer of the risk from the servant to the master, and should be considered, and treated as an assumption by the latter of that particular risk. It was not intended by the decision in the Van Duzen case to overthrow and abolish, in Ohio, the entire doctrine of assumption of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>risk, for the court in that case say: \u201cIt therefore follows that the servant can have no relief against his master for injuries resulting from known and obvious dangers, avoidable by ordinary care, however culpable the master may be in the matter. All such injuries, togethef with such as happen where there is no fault on the part of the master, are in the ordinary language of the law, assumed by the servant.\u201d Recognizing and affirming the rule thus stated, to be the well settled -general rule of law, the court in that case denied to the master the right to invoke its protection, only because it was there shown that the master had waived such right, by the doing of that which under the facts and circumstances proven, amounted on its part, to the assumption by it of the particular risk.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-7\">The case at bar presents no such conditions, or state of facts, as was shown to exist in that case, and is therefore, we think, clearly distinguishable from it. In the present case the evidence does not show that Johnston, the employe, was suddenly called from one. department or kind of work, to another, but does show that at the time he was injured, he was then engaged in precisely the same character of work he had been performing daily for at least five years. This work was simple, and the risk and dangers, if any, open and apparent. Johnston was an experienced hand in that particular -work, and there is no evidence even tending to show that the injury he received resulted from any incapacity on his part to understand the character and requirements of the work in which he was then engaged. Again, in this case the order given to the workmen was not a peremptory order, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>as in the Van Duzen case. What the foreman said, and all he said was: \u201cI have been around, boys, to try to get other men; but you boys do the best you can, I want you to help me out. I don\u2019t want you men to catch the spar until I give the word; when I give the word I want every man to catch hold of it and lift what he can.\u201d This, as shown by the record, was simply an order or direction to \u2022 the men to go about the work in the usual way, although perhaps with a less number than were usually employed in moving said spar. The handling of this spar required no special skill, arid involved no risk or peril\" except such'as was perfectly obvious to every one. Johnston knew its weight, or at least that it was heavy, and he knew the number of men ordinarily employed in handling it. He knew the conditions and circumstances under which the spar was\u201d to be handled on this particular-occasion, how the work was to be done, and if four men were insufficient to handle it prudently, he knew it. In fact, it does not appear from the record in this case that there was any fact, circumstance or condition within the knowledge of the company that was not equally well known to, and understood by, Johnston. Upon these facts Johnston was not entitled to recover. <em>Pennsylvania Co. </em>v. <em>McCurdy, </em>66 Ohio St., 118. And the trial court at the close of the evidence, when so requested, should have instructed the jury to return a verdict for the defendant. The judgments of the courts below must be reversed and judgment will be entered by this court for the plaintiff in error..</p>\n<p id=\"b179-5\">\n<em>Reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b179-6\">Shauck, C.
