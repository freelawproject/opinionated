Contemporaneously with the petition he filed an affidavit for attachment on the ground of the non-residence of the defendant. No execution had ever been issued upon said judgment nor had any proceeding been taken to revive it. Answering said petition, Graham pleaded, among other things, that said cause of action, if any, is barred by the statute of limitations. In the court of common pleas there was a judgment for the plaintiff, and it was affirmed by the circuit court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b120-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number><em>Mr. Willard, B.

If the action becomes dormant, and no execution is issued, he has the further right by Section 5367 to revive it, and the limitation fixed by Section 5368 for revivor is twenty-one years. If a party dies it may be revived in the name of his successor in trust or legal representatives. (Sec. 5154-) If a personal representative of a deceased person be removed, or die, it may likewise be revived in the name of the heirs or successors in trust, and the limitation fixed for such revivor is one year, unless by consent. (Secs. 5148-5157.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b120-10\">We believe that these sections of the statute are not intended to be cumulative, but are designed to be exclusive, fixing the method of procedure when a litigant is careless and allows his judgment to become dormant. <em>Smalley </em>v. <em>Bowling, </em>64 Kan., 818.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b120-11\">By a line of old decisions in this state it has been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>held that a \u201cjudgment\u201d is never barred, because it is not specifically specified as an action to be limited. That an action could always be maintained upon a judgment, although an execution would be set aside if issued. Those decisions, however, were controlled by the condition of the statutes existing at that time; but as time progressed and those sections of the statutes were changed, different limitations were placed upon the same action, so that now the former decisions could have no controlling force.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b121-6\">We claim the decision in <em>Tyler\u2019s Exrs. </em>v. <em>Winslow, </em>15 Ohio St., 364, is not applicable to our present statutes, and has been overruled in <em>Doyle </em>v. <em>West, </em>60 Ohio St., 438.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b121-7\">At the time the Tyler case was decided, Section 5367 did not contain a provision limiting \u201cdebts of record,\u201d as causes of action to be revived only within twenty-one years, but it did when <em>Doyle </em>v. <em>West </em>was decided by this court. Section 4985 at that time had a limitation of four years, while at the time <em>Doyle </em>v. <em>West </em>was decided it was ten years.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b121-8\">The Tyler case was a suit upon a judgment, while <em>Doyle </em>v. <em>West </em>was an action upon a \u201cdebt of record.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b121-9\">Four points were settled by this court in the Doyle-West case, and which overrule the same points decided adversely in the Tyler case.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b121-10\">1. That the \u201crendition of a judgment\u201d is the \u201caccruing of a cause of action.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b121-11\">2. That the legislature intended to provide a limitation for \u201call actions\u201d without exception.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b121-12\">3. That Section 4985, providing that all other actions not specifically mentioned should be barred in \u201cfour\u201d years, controlled the minds of the court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>in the Tyler case. That it is without application to our present <em>\"ten\u201d </em>years\u2019 statute. \u25a0</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b122-5\">4. That ten years is long enough for a debt of record, and should be for a judgment.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b122-6\"><em>Mr. Hollis C. Johnston; Mr. T. E. Bradbury </em>and <em>Mr. E. D. Davis, </em>for defendants .in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b122-7\">We think the decision in the case of <em>Tyler\u2019s Executors </em>v. <em>Winslow, </em>15 Ohio St., 364, is conclusive of this case, until it be overruled by this court. It will be noted that the question in <em>Doyle </em>v. <em>West, </em>60 Ohio St., 438, arose over a \u201cdebt of record,\u201d and not upon a dormant judgment, and this fact is especially noted in the opinion in the latter case.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b122-8\">Counsel for plaintiff in error are therefore entirely wrong when they say that the Doyle case is decisive of the matter in their favor. The fact of the matter is that it is decisive against them, because in the body of the opinion it is said: \u25a0</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b122-9\">\u201cThere is no disposition to overrule this case; but if persuaded that it was not rightly decided, there is more reason for confining its application to cases identical with it in facts.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b122-10\">The case at bar is identical with the case of Tyler\u2019s Executors, and under the language of the Doyle case, it must be considered conclusive, and that there is no statute of limitations against a judgment, other than the time requisite at common law to raise a presumption of payment, which is twenty-one years.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b122-11\">Shauck, C. J.</author>\n<p id=\"AzR\">That the judgment whose reversal is sought in this, proceeding is in' accordance with that pronounced by this court in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number><em>Tyler\u2019s Executors </em>v. <em>Winslow, </em>15 Ohio St., 364, is entirely clear. In that case two propositions were established: That although a judgment of a court of this state is a good ground of action, its rendition is not the accruing of a cause of action within the meaning of the act of February 18, 1831; and that, therefore, said act of limitation does not apply to an action founded upon a judgment of a court of. this state. By that decision the question involved was put to a rest which appears to have remained undisturbed until the announcement of <em>Doyle </em>v. <em>West, </em>60 Ohio St., 438. The able counsel who presented the latter case to this court did not understand that they were disturbing the general repose of that question, nor did they in any wise challenge the soundness of the former decision. The case which they presented was broadly distinguished by the fact that it was an action not founded upon a judgment.- It was an action to recover the portion of a debt which remained unpaid after the foreclosure of a mortgage by which it was secured and after the application of the proceeds of the sale of the mortgaged premises. In the suit to foreclose no personal judgment had been sought in the petition, nor was \u00e1ny rend\u00e9red, nor was there even an award of execution for the satisfaction of any balance which might remain unpaid after applying the proceeds of sale. The action was, therefore, for the recovery of a balance of the amount which the court had found to be the indebtedness secured by the mortgage, the finding having been made as the predicate of the decree of foreclosure to subject the mortgaged property, and not affording to the creditor any executory remedy against the general property of the debtor. That finding, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>though lacking essential characteristics of a judgment, was held to,be a debt evidenced by record and a proper foundation for an action, but subject to a limitation of ten years or fifteen years, the case not requiring a more precise conclusion upon that question. Our judgment in the case was placed upon the nature of the finding and its deficiencies in the characteristics of a judgment. This clearly appears from the syllabus, whose function in these reports is well known.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-6\">It is true that in the course of the opinion in the later case some doubts were expressed as to the correctness of the conclusion reached in <em>Tyler\u2019s Executors </em>v. <em>Winslow, </em>but they do not appear to have been shared by the concurring members of the court, nor did they enter into the decision. It is also true that in that opinion encouragement is given to the proposition urged by counsel for the plaintiff in error in the present case: that differences between the present statute limiting'actions and that considered in <em>Tyler\u2019s Executors </em>v. <em>Winslow </em>are material to the question before us. No difference of that character appears. The statutes afford equal foundation for the proposition there affirmed and distinctly stated that the rendition of a judgment is not the accrual of a cause of action. That proposition being accepted, the ultimate conclusion reached by this court in that case and by the courts below in the present case is inevitable. We perceive no such defect in the reasoning by which that proposition was supported as would justify us in disturbing a conclusion in which the legislature has acquiesced for more than forty years. At most, adherence to that conclusion imputes to the legislature only the intention that an action to recover <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>upon a judgment may be brought at any time within twenty-one years, which is the limitation expressly imposed by Section 5368 of the Revised Statutes upon an action to revive a judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b125-6\">Price, Crew, Summers, Spear and Davis, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
