L. c. 231A is reserved and reported without decision upon the pleadings and an agreement as to all the material facts. G. L. c. 214, \u00a7 31. The broad questions to be determined are whether G. L. c. 140, \u00a7 183A, and B.e-vised Ordinances of Boston (1947) c. 40A, \u00a7 1, cl. 92, are inapplicable or void as to the plaintiff in so far as they purport to impose licensing requirements and the payment of license, fees for furnishing public entertainment on weekdays solely through \u201cmusic provided by mechanical or electrical means\u201d by the use of \u201c juke boxes,\u201d television, or radio. The defendants are the city and the licensing board.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-20\">The plaintiff, a Massachusetts corporation, has a place of business known as \u201cBall and Bat Cafe\u201d at 565 Tremont Street, Boston. It has been licensed by the board as a common victualler under G. L. c. 140, \u00a7 2, and as a common victualler it has been further licensed by the board under G. L. c. 138, \u00a7 12, as amended, to sell, on all days of the week, all alcoholic beverages for consumption on its premises. The licenses for 1958 are evidenced by a combination license issued on December 31, 1957, upon payment of a fee of $45 under the Revised Ordinances of Boston (1947) c. 40A, \u00a7 1, cl. 68, for the common victualler\u2019s license and a fee of $1,400 under G. L. c. 138, \u00a7 12, for the alcoholic beverages license.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-33\">The plaintiff\u2019s premises have been maintained in a safe and proper manner, and have been inspected from time to time by the building department of the city, which has certified to their safety for occupancy as a restaurant with a seating capacity of 105. In the restaurant food <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>and drink are sold for cash to members of the general public without admission fee, cover charge, or minimum charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-5\">The plaintiff maintains two television sets and a radio set by which on weekdays it makes regularly broadcasted programs available to customers without any payment or deposit of money over and above their payment for food, drink, or other refreshment sold to them for cash. It also maintains a coin-operated \u201cjuke box,\u201d which is a phonograph, with a capacity for one hundred \u201ctwo play\u201d records. This is an automatic electrical device which furnishes recorded music, and through its use on lawful hours on weekdays the plaintiff makes available to customers \u201cmusical entertainment provided by mechanical or electrical means\u201d on a voluntary basis according to their own selection upon deposit of a coin, but without other payment or deposit of money over and above their payment for food, drink, or other refreshment sold to them for cash.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-6\">The plaintiff contends that it has the right to furnish to customers, at lawful times and in a proper manner and in compliance with all other pertinent laws, public entertainment on weekdays through the use of television, radio, and \u201cmusic provided by mechanical or electrical means\u201d without obtaining any license pursuant to G. L. c. 140, \u00a7 183A, or paying any license fee under cl. 92 of the ordinance.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-7\">General Laws c. 140, \u00a7 183A, as amended by St. 1936, c. 71, \u00a7 1, provides: \u201cNo innholder, common victualler or person owning, managing or controlling a caf\u00e9, restaurant or other eating or drinking establishment shall, as a part of his usual business, offer to view, set up, set on foot, maintain or carry on a concert, dance, exhibition, cabaret or public show of any description at which food or drink or other refreshment is sold for cash, or in connection with' which, after free admission, music or other amusement is provided or furnished upon payment or deposit of money, either as a cover charge or in payment for food, drink or other refreshment, unless and until a license therefor, to be exer<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>cised on week days only, has been issued by the licensing authorities .... Such licenses, unless sooner revoked, shall expire on December thirty-first of each year.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b240-7\">Chapter 40A,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> \u00a7 1, provides in part: \u201cFees and charges are hereby fixed under chapter 222 of the acts of 1949 as follows: . . . (92) <em>Entertainment License. </em>The fee for a license granted by the licensing board under section 183A of chapter 140 of the General Laws (including a license so granted to an innholder or common victualler) shall be $100.00; provided, that in cases where the entertainment is solely through the use of television, radio, and music provided by mechanical or electrical means, the fee shall be $50.00; and provided also, that in cases where the entertainment is solely provided by not exceeding four instrumentalists, the fee shall be $75.00.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b240-19\">On December 30, 1957, the board issued to the plaintiff upon the payment of $50 a weekday entertainment license under cl. 92 for radio, phonograph, and television for the year 1958.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-23\">1. There is first presented the question whether the plaintiff\u2019s activities fall within \u00a7 183A. The initial problem of construction is whether \u201cin connection with which\u201d refers to \u201cusual business\u201d or to \u201cconcert, dance, exhibition, cabaret or public show of any description. \u201d We think that the reference is to the latter. In the interests of brevity we refrain from spelling out the defendants\u2019 detailed argument to the contrary. Our interpretation means that in order to sustain the board\u2019s authority, the plaintiff\u2019s activities must constitute a \u201cpublic show of any description,\u201d inasmuch as the other words, \u201cconcert, dance, exhibition, cabaret,\u201d are obviously inapplicable. We do not agree with the plaintiff that \u00a7 183A, which mentions no hours, is only a \u201cnight club \u201d statute, and confined to \u201clive\u201d entertainment. We believe that the statutory purpose is to regulate anyone who provides entertainment in connection with the business of furnishing \u201cfood or drink or other refreshment. \u201d Granting that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>television might have been unknown when \u00a7 183A was drafted, the very broad language, \u201cpublic show of any description,\u201d must be taken to comprehend new modes of entertainment. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Welosky, </em>276 Mass. 398, 403. We, therefore, do not accept the plaintiff\u2019s argument that \u00a7 183A does not include a \u201cjuke box\u201d because of the omission of the specific, but narrower, phrase found in \u00a7 181, \u201camusement . . . furnished upon a deposit of money in a coin controlled apparatus.\u201d The greater phrase used includes the lesser. Further detailed discussion of the arguments respecting this aspect of statutory interpretation would profit our jurisprudence nothing.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-5\">2. Another question of construction is presented by the last sentence of \u00a7 183A, which provides that \u201cno fee shall be chargeable\u201d for the license thereby required \u201cto a person who, for the period covered by such license, is also licensed under section two.\u201d General Laws c. 140, \u00a7 2, reads in part: \u201cLicensing authorities may grant licenses to persons to be innholders or common victuallers. \u201d The plaintiff argues that because it is already licensed as a common victualler under c. 40A, \u00a7 1, cl. 68, it cannot be made to acquire an entertainment license under cl. 92, which expressly refers to \u00a7 183A.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-6\">The answer to this argument is found in St. 1949, c. 222, entitled \u201cAn Act empowering the city of Boston to fix by ordinance certain fees and charges. \u201d The said act provides in \u00a7 1, \u201cThe city of Boston may from time to time, by ordinance, fix the fees for all licenses and permits granted under the authority of statutes where the entire proceeds of the fee form part of the income of the city, \u201d with exceptions not presently material. Section 3 reads: \u201cA fee or charge fixed by ordinance under this act shall be deemed to apply notwithstanding any general or special law heretofore passed fixing a different fee or charge or imposing any limitation on the amount thereof or designating a particular board or officer to fix said amount .... No general or special law hereafter passed shall, in the absence of express and explicit mention therein of this act, be construed to repeal this act <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>in whole or in part or to affect in any way any fee or charge theretofore or thereafter fixed by ordinance under this act.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b242-6\">The Legislature in c. 222 showed an intent to empower the city to fix certain license fees, such as the one before us, and to make c. 222 the sole source of power unless express mention of the act should be made in later legislation. The language of \u00a7 3 must be taken to wipe the slate clean of prior limitations even though expressed in the formally prohibitory words, \u201cno fee shall be chargeable. \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b242-13\">3. The plaintiff raises constitutional questions. In so doing it asserts that \u00a7 183A \u201cis clearly a censorship statute,\u201d and that \u201c \u00a7 183A and cl. 92 do not regulate, in any respect or to any extent, the place or time or manner of, nor the machine or device employed in, such 'entertainment, \u2019 but <em>directly </em>and <em>immediately </em>and <em>exclusively </em>apply their force to the actual <em>content </em>of the entertainment furnished. \u201d With these assertions we are not in accord. Section 183A is not a censorship statute. We are of opinion that the purpose of \u00a7 183A and of the ordinance is the preservation of public order at public entertainments. We fail to perceive any prior restraint or any attempt to impinge upon the constitutional guaranties of free speech and freedom of the press. We regard such cases as <em>Joseph Burstyn, Inc. </em>v. <em>Wilson, </em>343 U. S. 495, and <em>Brattle Films, Inc. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Pub. Safety, </em>333 Mass. 58, as inapplicable to the statute and ordinance rightly construed. In <em>Jaffarian </em>v. <em>Building Commr. of Somerville, </em>275 Mass. 267, 271, this court said in an opinion by Chief Justice Rugg, \u201cThe right to require licenses is based on the conception that places of public amusement may require supervision by public authorities to the end that they may not degenerate and become obnoxious to the public welfare.\u201d See <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>247 Mass. 589, 594-595.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-37\">The license by the express terms of \u00a7 183A is granted on H an annual basis. Not only would it be impractical and be- H yond all reasonable possibility to pass upon the entire next H year\u2019s programs in granting a license, but there is rio sugges- \u25a0 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>tian that the board ever attempted to use the licensing requirement as a cloak for exercising as to even one day\u2019s program a censorship power which the statute does not confer.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-5\">We are mindful of the plaintiff\u2019s argument that \u00a7 183A establishes no standards for the granting or denial of licenses, and is, therefore, void under the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States. But the purpose being the preservation of public order at public entertainments, greater particularity was not required. Instead of attempting to make an advance delineation of all possible circumstances in which applications might be made or licenses granted, \u00a7 183A confers upon the licensing authorities a \u201cquasi judicial authority to determine the facts and to pass upon the application in each instance under the serious sense of responsibility imposed upon them by their official positions and the delicate character of the duty entrusted to them.\u201d <em>Butler </em>v. <em>East Bridgewater, </em>330 Mass. 33, 37. They cannot act in an unreasonable or arbitrary manner. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McGann, </em>213 Mass. 213, 215. <em>General Outdoor Advertising Co. Inc. </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Works, </em>289 Mass. 149, 192. <em>State </em>v. <em>Cox, </em>91 N. H. 137, 144, affd. sub nom. <em>Cox </em>v. <em>New Hampshire, </em>312 U. S. 569, 576. See <em>Hannan </em>v. <em>Haverhill, </em>120 F. 2d 87, 89 (1st Cir.). They cannot function as a board of censors. Each individual application must be determined on its own set of facts. The licensing procedure is appropriate to afford notice to the municipal authorities of locations where large numbers of people might gather at one time under a single roof. See <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>247 Mass. 589, 594-595. It is likewise proper that the operation of radios, television sets, and \u201cjuke boxes\u201d in restaurants, bars, taverns, and other eating or drinking places not be allowed to become a public nuisance due to noise. That the plaintiff\u2019s premises have never become a nuisance is not decisive. <em>Boston </em>v. <em>Schaffer, </em>9 Pick. 415, 419. <em>Jaffarian </em>v. <em>Building Commr. of Somerville, </em>275 Mass. 267, 271. <em>Murphy </em>v. <em>California, </em>225 U. S. 623, 629. <em>Adams </em>v. <em>Tanner, </em>244 U. S. 590, 594.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-6\">We do not accept the contention that Congress has so <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>legislated<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> that the States have been excluded from dealing with television and radio as a matter of local public order. The statements in <em>Allen B. Dumont Labs. Inc. </em>v. <em>Carroll, </em>184 F. 2d 153, 156 (3d Cir.), must be read in the light of the question before the court, which was one of attempted State censorship. As the court said, also at page 156, \u201cProgram control was entrusted to the Federal Commission and it is an effective one.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b244-5\">Another case relied upon by the plaintiff which must be read within the scope of the question presented is <em>Brattle Films, Inc. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Pub. Safety, </em>333 Mass. 58. We were there dealing with a statute, G. L. c. 136, \u00a7 4, which required advance approval by public officials of a motion picture film intended for public entertainment on the Lord\u2019s day \u201cas being in keeping with the character of the day and not inconsistent with its due observance.\u201d The holding (page 62) was that the statute \u201cas applied to the plaintiff in the circumstances set forth in the bill of complaint is unconstitutional and void.\u201d In a companion case brought by a motion picture distributor, <em>Times Film Corp. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Pub. Safety, </em>333 Mass. 62, which raised a similar question under the same statute, we dismissed the petition without prejudice, saying (page 63), \u201cIt is not to be assumed that the respondent, who is a public officer and a defendant in the <em>Brattle Films </em>case, will not carry out his duty under the law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b244-6\">4. A final decree is to be entered declaring that the plaintiff\u2019s activities as set forth in its bill fall within G. L. c. 140, \u00a7 183A, and Revised Ordinances of Boston (1947) c. 40A, \u00a7 1, cl. 92, the provisions of which are not unconstitutional or void as applied to the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b240-40\"><em> </em>Effective December 1, 1956. \u2014 Reporter.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b244-8\"> Communications act of 1934, \u00a7\u00a7 2 (a), 3 (b, d), 303 (g), 48 Stat. 1064, 1065, 1082, as amended, 47 U.
