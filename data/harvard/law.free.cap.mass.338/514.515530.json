L. c. 118A, \u00a7 4 (as amended through St. 1951, c. 801, \u00a7 4),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> was recorded in the registry of deeds. Upon Chadwick\u2019s application, the town granted to him old age assistance in the amount of $1,638.50. After Chadwick\u2019s death, real estate taxes accrued in the sum of $587.42, and the real estate depreciated in value. The facts, except the value of the real estate, have been agreed. The judge found this value to be not less than $2,500 at the date of his finding (June 20, 1957) and somewhat more at the date of Chadwick\u2019s death. A final decree was entered (1) declaring that the defendants were indebted to the town for $1,638.50 for old age assistance and for $620.68 for taxes and interest; (2) ordering the real estate sold at public auction; and (3) directing distribution of the proceeds in the following manner. From the proceeds, the sum of $1,500 (the amount mentioned in \u00a7 4; see footnote 1, <em>supra) </em>was to be set aside. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>Out of this $1,500 the real estate taxes and interest were to be paid to the town and the balance of the $1,500 was to be distributed among Chadwick\u2019s heirs at law. From the proceeds in excess of $1,500 were to be paid the costs of sale, and then the amount of $1,638.50 to the town in satisfaction of its lien. The surplus, if any, was to be distributed among Chadwick\u2019s heirs. The defendants appealed. Their contentions are discussed below.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-5\">1. Section 4, as amended in 1951,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> has not been construed by this court in the respects here relevant. Cf. <em>Weaver </em>v. <em>New Bedford, </em>335 Mass. 644, and <em>Henderson </em>v. <em>Yarmouth, </em>335 Mass. 647. Under \u00a7 4 whether a lien for old age assistance may be enforced after a recipient\u2019s death depends on whether the fair market value of the recipient\u2019s real estate and the cash surrender value of the recipient\u2019s life insurance \u201cat the time of his decease\u201d exceed $1,500. The town, asserting the hen for old age assistance under \u00a7 4, in order to satisfy that lien may not have recourse to the first $1,500 of value of the real estate and insurance. No provision of \u00a7 4, however, bars the town from asserting its lien for taxes (G. L. c. 60, \u00a7 37, as amended through St. 1943, c. 478, \u00a7 1) against that first $1,500 of value. The trial judge properly ordered the amount of the taxes accruing after the death of Chadwick to be deducted from the first $1,500 of proceeds of the sale. Similarly, the lien of the town for old age assistance is not subordinated by anything in \u00a7 4 to the expenses of administering the estate of a deceased recipient of assistance. The right to sell real estate to pay debts and expenses given by G. L. c. 202, \u00a7\u00a7 1, 2, 14 (as amended), is subject to liens existing at the time of the recipient\u2019s death. See <em>Tyndale </em>v. <em>Stanwood, </em>182 Mass. 534, 536; Newhall, Settlement of Estates (4th ed.) \u00a7 119, at pp. 358-359.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-6\">2. The town is not barred by loches in enforcing its lien. <em>Sears </em>v. <em>Treasurer &amp; Receiver Gen. </em>327 Mass. 310, 326.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>3. The defendants\u2019 objections to so much of the decree as orders sale at public auction by a commissioner is without merit. Public auction is a reasonable method of judicial sale to enforce a lien where equitable enforcement of the lien is expressly authorized as under \u00a7 4. See <em>National Radiator Corp. </em>v. <em>Parad, </em>297 Mass. 314, 319-320; Pomeroy, Equity Jurisprudence (5th ed.) \u00a7\u00a7 171 (4), 1228, 1268. See also <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>Martin-Wilson Automatic Fire Alarm Co. </em>151 Mass. 515, 517-519; <em>Eastern Bridge &amp; Structural Co. </em>v. <em>Worcester Auditorium Co. </em>216 Mass. 426, 428-431; <em>Seder </em>v. <em>Kozlowski, </em>311 Mass. 30, 32-33. We need not consider upon what terms and to what extent in the judge\u2019s discretion the commissioner could have been authorized to sell at private sale. Cf. G. L. c. 202, \u00a7 14 (as amended through St. 1934, c. 157, \u00a7 1); c. 241, \u00a7 31. In any event there has not been shown any abuse of discretion in ordering sale at public auction.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-10\">4. The defendants contend that \u00a7 4 as amended in 1951 is unconstitutional, even though it operated only prospectively.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> They have advanced no reason which leads us to doubt that the Commonwealth may provide that old age assistance shall be furnished to persons applying for it under reasonable, nondiscriminatory terms and conditions calling for reimbursement from available resources of the recipient or his estate. Chadwick accepted assistance after the effective date of the 1951 amendment. There is nothing inequitable or unreasonable in holding him, and those claiming under him, to be bound by the provisions of the amendment relating to reimbursement. See <em>Boston </em>v. <em>McCafferty, </em>328 Mass. 177; note, 29 A. L. R. 2d 731, 733. In such matters there is a wide legislative discretion. See <em>Howes Bros. Co. </em>v. <em>Unemployment Compensation Commn. </em>296 Mass. 275, 283-286, cert. den. 300 U. S. 657. Cf. <em>Carmichael </em>v. <em>Southern Coal &amp; Coke Co. </em>301 U. S. 495, 515-521.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-13\">\n<em>Decree affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b553-9\"> Section 4 (which by St. 1951, c. 801, \u00a7 7, became effective in its amended form as of January 1, 1952) as so amended reads in part as follows: \u201cThe ownership ... of an interest in real estate by an applicant . . . shall not disqualify him from receiving [old age] assistance . . . provided, however, that the town shall take a lien on such property as a condition of granting old age assistance ....
