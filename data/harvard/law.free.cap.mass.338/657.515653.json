The case is here on the plaintiff\u2019s exception to the direction of <em>&amp; </em>verdict for the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-4\">From the brief record of the evidence it appears that in 1947 or 1948 the plaintiff\u2019s wife bought a lot of land at the corner of Saratoga and Addison streets in East Boston on which the defendant was maintaining a pole for the guying of a series of poles carrying wires on Addison Street. The defendant had no written authorization for the erection or maintenance of the pole and its \"location was purely permissive.\u201d In May, 1954, the plaintiff sold a plant at 155 Addison Street and planned \"to go into a smaller business . . ., the manufacturing of spumoni, in a new building to be erected\u201d on the said lot of his wife. He called one Pellegrini, the district manager of the defendant whom he had known for twenty years and with whom he had dealt in connection with his former business, and said, \"The pole is in the middle of the lot, here, and I want it moved out, because that is going to obstruct the construction.\u201d Pellegrini said, \"I\u2019ll take care of it.\u201d \u201cAfter several calls, Pellegrini said he would come over and take the pole out of where it was and put it in front of the building, so that the plaintiff could go on with his construction without being obstructed temporarily, because they couldn\u2019t move it out to the street, because they had to have a hearing at city hall to take the pole out and put it in the street and so he said: 'Temporarily, we will put the pole there in front of the building.\u2019 \u201d The pole was moved in June or July to a location between the front of the building and the sidewalk as shown on the photographs in evidence. \u201cAs the construction went along, the plaintiff had further talk with Pellegrini and told him 'to move the pole out of there, because I couldn\u2019t continue to keep moving the pole out, you know, hurrying him to take the pole out of the way.\u2019 Pellegrini said he had to wait until he got the hearing date and the O.K. from the city before they could move it from there onto the sidewalk.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b697-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>The plaintiff was injured on September 16, 1954, by tripping over a guy wire which extended from near the top of the pole to an anchor in the ground, He was passing through a space two or three feet wide between the wire and the building. The plaintiff knew that the pole and wire were there and testified, \u201cI probably went in there thousands of times and never got hurt but, on this particular day, I went in and caught my leg.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b697-5\">The plaintiff although alleging unlawful conduct has presented no evidence' of violation of law by the defendant from which a civil right of action would arise. See <em>Dean </em>v. Leonard, 323 Mass. 606, 607-608. Nor does he seek recovery on grounds suggested in Restatement: Torts, \u00a7 380. His case is predicated on the defendant\u2019s negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-8\">To prove such negligence it must appear that the defendant has committed a breach of a duty of care owed to the plaintiff. In determining the nature and extent of this duty the respective relations of the parties to the landowner are to be considered. It could be found from the nature of the construction work performed by the plaintiff on Ms wife\u2019s land that she had allowed Mm to use the land for Ms personal business. Such permission, however, did not make Mm her tenant or give Mm any interest in her property. <em>Colbert </em>v. <em>Richer, </em>314 Mass. 138, 139. Compare <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Benjamin, </em>8 Allen, 197. His right to use the land was at most that of a licensee.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-11\">The defendant appears from the long continued use of the land for its pole at some time to have been a licensee, originally of the prior owner, and subsequently of the plaintiff\u2019s wife. Whether as to her it had become a trespasser when the plaintiff was injured depends on whether she had ordered it to remove its pole and it had failed within a reasonable time to do so. See <em>Nelson </em>v. <em>American Tel. &amp; Tel. Co. </em>270 Mass. 471.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-12\">No evidence was offered that the notice to the defendant to remove its pole was by her authority. The mere relation of husband and wife is not sufficient to show that one spouse is actmg as the agent of another. <em>Barker </em>v. <em>Mackay, </em>175 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>Mass. 485. <em>Harvey </em>v. <em>Squire, </em>217 Mass. 411. <em>Hannon </em>v. <em>Schwartz, </em>304 Mass. 468, 470. <em>Gordon </em>v. <em>O\u2019Brien, </em>320 Mass. 739, 741. But if it could be found that the plaintiff\u2019s notice was impliedly authorized by his wife, the defendant did not become a trespasser as to him. Its duty of care remained no greater than that of one licensee to another, namely, to act in a manner which foreseeably would not be likely to cause harm to another rightfully on the premises. <em>Brosnan </em>v. <em>Gage, </em>240 Mass. 113, 117. <em>Buckley </em>v. <em>Arthur J. Hickey Family Laundry Co. </em>261 Mass. 348. <em>Falardeau </em>v. <em>Malden &amp; Melrose Gas Light Co. </em>275 Mass. 196, 199. Restatement: Torts, \u00a7 381.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-6\">The defendant had no reason to warn the plaintiff of the relocation of the pole which it had moved with his knowledge, if not with his tacit consent. <em>O\u2019Hanley </em>v. <em>Norwood, </em>315 Mass. 440, 442. We think that the jury would not have been warranted in finding that the probability of contact with the pole or wire by the plaintiff was such that in the exercise of reasonable care additional safeguards in the form of some protective devices were reasonably required. Ordinarily it may be assumed that a visitor on land will not violently come in contact with fixed objects which are known to him and the danger of which is obvious. See <em>Hoyt </em>v. <em>Woodbury, </em>200 Mass. 343, 345; <em>Brooks </em>v. <em>Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co. </em>302 Mass. 184, 187; <em>Flynn </em>v. <em>Cities Serv. Ref. Co. </em>306 Mass. 302, 304; <em>Lookner </em>v. <em>New York, N. H. &amp; H. R.R. </em>333 Mass. 555, 557.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-10\">There was no error in directing a verdict for the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-11\">It is not necessary to discuss the question of the plaintiff\u2019s contributory negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-12\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
