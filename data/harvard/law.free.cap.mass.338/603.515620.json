The declaration contained three counts. The jury returned a verdict <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>for the defendant on counts 1 and 2, and for the plaintiff on count 3. The only question for decision is whether there was error in the denial of the defendant\u2019s motion for a directed verdict on count 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-5\">Count 1 was based upon gross negligence causing injury to a social guest. Count 2 was for negligent injury to a business invitee. The third count alleged that the plaintiff and the defendant were \u201cengaged in a common or joint enterprise and that while engaged in said enterprise the plaintiff was lawfully riding in a motor vehicle operated by the defendant . . . on a public way . . . in a careless, negligent and reckless manner; and while the defendant was so operating said motor vehicle and by reason of and as a result of the defendant\u2019s carelessness, negligence and recklessness . . . the plaintiff was severely injured . . ..\u201d The plaintiff specified as to count 3: \u201cThe plaintiff and the defendant were engaged in a common and joint enterprise in that the plaintiff and the defendant had mutual business interests and that day had gone to Old Orchard, Maine, in the defendant\u2019s car at the invitation of the defendant, to attend to certain matters arising out of the business ventures between them.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b642-6\">It is agreed that there was evidence warranting the jury in finding that the defendant was negligent and that the plaintiff was not contributorily negligent.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-7\">In this court the plaintiff does not base his right to recover upon the existence of a joint enterprise, and in effect treats all such reference in count 3 as surplusage. To do this successfully, the remaining allegations must state a cause of action upon which the evidence warranted a verdict for the plaintiff. \u201cIt is not necessary that all the allegations should be proved if enough are proved to make out a cause of action.\u201d <em>Litchfield </em>v. <em>Hutchinson, </em>117 Mass. 195, 198. In addition, his proof must conform to his specifications. <em>Shea </em>v. <em>Crompton &amp; Knowles Loom Works, </em>305 Mass. 327, 329. <em>Stewart </em>v. <em>Morgan, </em>316 Mass. 164, 165. <em>Snow </em>v. <em>Metropolitan Transit Authy. </em>323 Mass. 21, 23. The declaration and specifications so construed state a cause of action upon which there was evidence to warrant the verdict. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>See <em>Labatte </em>v. <em>Lavallee, </em>258 Mass. 527; <em>Alderman </em>v. <em>Noble, </em>296 Mass. 30, 31.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-5\">At the time of the accident the parties were passing through Revere on a return trip to Boston from Old Orchard, Maine, to which place they had gone earlier in the day. The facts which the jury could have found are these. The parties were \u201cinterested\u201d in a corporation, known as Seashore Amusements, Inc., which operated \u201camusements and rides\u201d upon real estate at Old Orchard leased from one Osher, the owner. It had recently been the scene of a fire, and the purpose of the trip was to view the damage and to talk with Osher to get lower rent. They did not see Osher, but they divided $90 in the safe, and went to a lawyer\u2019s office. There it was said that they could not rent any space without getting \u201cstraightened out\u201d with Osher. The plaintiff was a stockholder, treasurer, arid general manager. The defendant had given him \u201csome cash\u201d for the business, and \u201chad a part interest in the rides.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b643-6\">We are of opinion that the jury could warrantably find that the plaintiff had conferred a benefit in the performance of something in which the defendant had an interest. As was said in <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>Goldstein, </em>329 Mass. 161, 163, \u201cAlthough the most obvious benefit to a defendant is one of a direct pecuniary nature, an indirect pecuniary benefit or an undertaking which holds out the hope of a pecuniary benefit may be sufficient to entitle the plaintiff to recover for ordinary negligence.\u201d We cite a few of the many cases illustrating the principle. <em>Foley </em>v. <em>McDonald, </em>283 Mass. 96. <em>Epstein </em>v. <em>Simco Trading Co. Inc. </em>297 Mass. 282. <em>Roy </em>v. <em>Bacon, </em>325 Mass. 173. <em>Hanlon </em>v. <em>White Fuel Corp. </em>328 Mass. 455, 458-459. That the object of the trip was likewise of advantage to the plaintiff does not render the principle inapplicable. <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Queen, </em>257 Mass. 515. <em>Foley </em>v. <em>McDonald, </em>283 Mass. 96. That the accident occurred on the homeward journey is not a material consideration. <em>Weida </em>v. <em>MacDougall, </em>300 Mass. 521, 524. <em>Howes </em>v. <em>Kelman, </em>326 Mass. 696, 698.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-7\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
