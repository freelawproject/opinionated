The case is here upon the plaintiff\u2019s exceptions to the direction of verdicts for the defendant upon all three counts of the declaration.</p>\n<p id=\"AnT\">The salient facts are these: On December 4, 1953, Archibald Fraser, the plaintiff\u2019s testator, a man then seventy-five years of age but deceased since the trial (hereinafter called the plaintiff), lent the sum of $2,175 to the defendant with whom he had been on friendly terms for years and whom he treated \"like a daughter.\u201d In return he took an interest free note payable in twenty-two years from that date with annual payments of $100 on principal. He also took a second mortgage on the defendant\u2019s house in West Roxbury to secure the note. The mortgage was not recorded. Payments of $100 each were made on the first and second anniversaries of the date of the note, on December 4, 1954, and on December 4, 1955. Sometime in 1956 the defendant was negotiating for the sale of her house on which the plaintiff held the unrecorded mortgage. On July 20 of that year, the defendant wrote the plaintiff in part: \u201cI believe you have the deed ... so will you please mail the deed to me . . . so I will have same with me. After everything is completed, I will settle with you . . . .\u201d It is clear that by \"the deed\u201d she meant the mortgage deed held by the plaintiff. She testified at the trial: \"I was all confused at the time, and I didn\u2019t know the difference between a deed and a mortgage note . . ..\u201d In answer to her letter the plaintiff sent the mortgage deed to her by mail. At' the time when the defendant wrote the letter asking for its return and promising to \"settle with\u201d the plaintiff after she had sold her house, no payments were due on the note. The defendant testified that by the word \u201csettle\u201d she \u201cthought that if there was anything due on the mortgage note, when <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>I passed the papers, that I would pay Mr. Fraser, but I didn\u2019t know that I owed anything on the note or not.\u201d The plaintiff testified, however, that when he next saw the defendant after he had mailed her the mortgage deed, \u201cI told her I\u2019d been there [at her new address] for my money.\u201d He also testified that he sent her the mortgage in reliance upon her promise to \u201csettle\u201d with him, that is, to pay the loan.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-5\">A suggestion of death of the plaintiff on December 14, 1957, was filed and the executor has prosecuted these exceptions.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-6\">We are of the opinion that there was error in the ordering of verdicts for the defendant on the first and third counts.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b345-7\">There was evidence that the defendant believed that the return of the unrecorded mortgage would facilitate the contemplated sale of her house and stated that if the plaintiff would give her the mortgage \u201cI will settle with you.\u201d The jury could disbelieve her explanation that she did not know the difference between a deed and a mortgage note, as they could find that she already had previous experience with a savings bank which held the first mortgage upon the same premises, and that she had already made two payments on the instant mortgage. The jury could find that she knew the relationship between the note and mortgage she had given the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-8\">The defendant contends that there was no agreement for the acceleration of the payment of the mortgage indebtedness and that if any arrangement was made concerning that loan it was too vague and indefinite to constitute a contract. Both parties testified as to their intentions in the transaction which resulted in the return of the mortgage instrument to the defendant. Where the terms of a written contract are ambiguous, both parties may testify as to what they understood by the terms of the contract when they exe<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>outed it. The jury will then determine what were its terms and apply the law to such facts as they find comprised its terms. <em>Rizzo </em>v. <em>Cunningham, </em>303 Mass. 16, 20. The jury could have found what arrangement the parties had in mind. Upon the evidence the contract was not too vague to be enforced. The subject was fully discussed by Rugg, J., in <em>Silver </em>v. <em>Graves, </em>210 Mass. 26, 28-30. <em>Noble </em>v. <em>Mead-Morrison Mfg. Co. </em>237 Mass. 5, 18-19. There was evidence that the plaintiff gave up the mortgage at the defendant\u2019s request and in reliance upon her promise to \u201csettle\u201d with him on the mortgage indebtedness. The surrender of his security would be adequate consideration for her promise. <em>Devine </em>v. <em>Murphy, </em>168 Mass. 249, 250. See <em>Stebbins </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>4 Pick. 97; Restatement: Contracts, \u00a7 76 (a). As was said in <em>Devine </em>v. <em>Murphy, </em>at p. 250, the giving up of a mortgage in return for a promise by the mortgagor \u201cis an ordinary case of a simple contract for a valuable consideration.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AtQ1\">With respect to the second count of the plaintiff\u2019s declaration, for money had and received, such an action \u201cmay in general be maintained whenever one has money in his hands belonging to another which in equity and good conscience he ought to pay over to the other. . . . The action may nevertheless be maintained where no money has actually passed but something has been received as a credit which is the equivalent of money.\u201d <em>Sherman </em>v. <em>Werby, </em>280 Mass. 157, 160-161. \u201cWhere property belonging to the plaintiff has been reduced to money after it was received by the defendant but before the action is brought, money had and received lies.\u201d <em>Devlin </em>v. <em>Houghton, </em>202 Mass. 75, 78. <em>Simmons </em>v. <em>Barns, </em>263 Mass. 472, 475. But here we find nothing in the record to indicate that the defendant held proceeds that remained from the sale of her house part of which in equity and good conscience belonged to the plaintiff. The judge was correct, therefore, in directing a verdict in favor of the defendant on the second count.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-5\">\n<em>Exceptions sustained as to the first and third counts; exceptions overruled as to the second count.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b345-9\"> These counts alleged in substance that the plaintiff surrendered the mortgage to the defendant in reliance on her assurance that (count 1) \u201cthe balance of the mortgage note would be paid\u201d or that (count 3) she \u201cwould settle up the entire loan,\u201d and that after selling her property she refused to pay the plaintiff such balance. \u2014 Repobteb.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
