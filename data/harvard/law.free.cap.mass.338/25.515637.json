The petitioner was employed as a laboratory technician in the sanatorium division of the Boston City Hospital. Following a hearing held on April 26, 1957, by the hospital board of trustees (the appointing authority under G. L. c. 31, \u00a7 43) the petitioner was notified <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>that she was removed as of the close of business, April 30, 1957, for \u201cconduct unbecoming an employee of the hospital [and] for the good of the service.\u201d The petitioner within five days requested a hearing before the civil service commission. \u00a7 43 (b). On May 2, 1957, the petitioner\u2019s request for a hearing was acknowledged and a hearing date was set for May 10. Subsequently this was changed to August 5. Having failed to appear at the hearing, the petitioner was notified by the commission that her request for a hearing was dismissed. Thereupon the petitioner brought this petition for a writ of mandamus, which was ordered dismissed \u201cas a matter of law and also as a matter of discretion.\u201d From a judgment entered in accordance with this order, the petitioner appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-5\">There was no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-6\">The notice of decision did not state \u201cfully and specifically the reasons therefor\u201d as required by G. L. c. 31, \u00a7 43 (a), and the petitioner could then have asserted her rights in mandamus proceedings. <em>Peckham </em>v. <em>Mayor of Fall River, </em>253 Mass. 590, 593. <em>Bois </em>v. <em>Mayor of Fall River, 257 </em>Mass. 471. She did not adopt that course but instead requested a hearing before the commission under \u00a7 43 (b). The case at bar is governed in principle by <em>Daley </em>v. <em>District Court of Western Hampden, </em>304 Mass. 86, 92. There the petitioner was removed in proceedings conducted under G. L. c. 31, \u00a7 42B, pursuant to an invalid notice. The petitioner thereafter sought judicial review under \u00a7 42B and in those proceedings attempted to challenge the sufficiency of the notice. It was held that the petitioner could have challenged the removal on the ground of improper notice by bringing a petition for a writ of mandamus, but having failed to avail himself of that remedy and having sought judicial review under the statute, he thereby admitted that there had been such a hearing before the commission as to entitle him to review, and that he thereby waived the deficiency in the notice and could not raise it thereafter. So here, the petitioner could have challenged the removal in mandamus proceedings on the ground of insufficient notice at the time <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>she received it, but she saw fit not to do so and requested the administrative review afforded by \u00a7 43 (b). Having done so, she must be deemed to have waived the deficiency in the notice and lost the right to question it in the present proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
