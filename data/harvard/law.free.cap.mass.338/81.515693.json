L. c. 117, \u00a7\u00a7 7-12,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> by the town of Hatfield (hereinafter called <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>the town) to force the defendant to contribute to his father\u2019s support. A judgment was entered for the town in the District Court. The defendant claimed an appeal to the Superior Court \u201cfor [a] new trial on the merits.\u201d He now contends that he was entitled to do so under G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 97.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The town\u2019s motion in the Superior Court to dismiss the defendant\u2019s appeal was allowed. The defendant has claimed an appeal from this dismissal to this court and has also filed a bill of exceptions.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-12\">The narrow question presented for our decision is whether a proceeding under \u00a7 7 (see footnote 1, <em>supra) </em>is a \u201ccivil action\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 97 (see footnote 2, <em>supra). </em>If it is, the defendant is entitled to a trial de nova on the merits in the Superior Court. If a proceeding under \u00a7 7 is not such a \u201ccivil action,\u201d no new trial is available under \u00a7 97.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-19\">The procedure under \u00a7 7 and related sections for compelling support of an indigent person by bis kindred is statutory. See <em>South Reading </em>v. <em>Hutchinson, </em>10 Allen, 68, in which Bigelow, C.J., said that the proceeding was \u201cnot a personal action\u201d but \u201ca proceeding of a peculiar nature, authorized by Gen. Sts. c. 70, \u00a7 5\u201d (a predecessor of the present \u00a7 7). There is no occasion for tracing the earlier history of the section which in part goes back to St. 1692-3, c. 28, \u00a7 9, but, in modern times, the proceeding seems to have been intended to be exclusively within the jurisdiction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>of the courts named from time to time in \u00a7 7 (cf. <em>Cooper </em>v. <em>Skinner, </em>124 Mass. 183, 184-185; <em>Fourth Natl. Bank </em>v. <em>Mead, </em>214 Mass. 549, 550-551) and its predecessors, and to have been regarded as on the equity side of the court. The liability under \u00a7 7 (see also G. L. [Ter. Ed.] c. 117, \u00a7 31) has been enforced in equity. See <em>Great Barrington </em>v. <em>Gibbons, </em>199 Mass. 527, 528-529.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-5\">Revised Laws (1902) c. 81, \u00a7 11 (confirming a change of language made by St. 1898, c. 425, \u00a7 4), was a predecessor of \u00a7 7. Section 11 placed jurisdiction of proceedings thereunder in a \u201cjustice of the superior court sitting in equity.\u201d See note, Report of the Commissioners for Consolidating and Arranging the Public Statutes, vol. 1, pp. 676-677. The section remained unchanged in this respect after the revision, and through the recodification of 1921 and the changes effected in the section by St. 1928, c. 155, \u00a7 16. By St. 1950, c. 485, \u00a7 1, the section was changed to give such jurisdiction to a \u201cjustice of the superior court or a judge or special judge of a probate court sitting in equity.\u201d By St. 1956, c. 156, such jurisdiction was transferred to the District Court without any indication, either in the statute itself or in its legislative history,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> of change in the equitable character of the proceedings. A purpose may well have been to take from the Superior Court and the Probate Court certain cases involving generally small amounts and continuing supervision which more appropriately and more easily could be dealt with in the several District Courts. We perceive no trace of any legislative intention to turn what had been a proceeding in equity into an action at law in the District Court subject to retrial in the Superior Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-6\">We are confirmed in this view by the circumstance that an equitable proceeding, like that under \u00a7 7, does not readily fit within the term \u201ccivil action.\u201d The term \u201ccivil action,\u201d which is used in \u00a7 97, ordinarily is applied under our State practice to actions at law. It further may be noted that no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>change was made in G. L. c. 117, \u00a7 9, by the 1956 amendment. Section 9 (see footnote 1, supra) calls for continuing supervision and alteration, by the court having jurisdiction under \u00a7 7, of the support payments as circumstances change. It would obviously be awkward, if such continuing supervision had to be exercised in the District Court subject to recurring trials de nova in another court. It is unlikely that the Legislature intended any such result. Because the proceedings are equitable in character, this is not the type of proceeding with respect to which a jury trial is required under art. 15 of the Declaration of Rights of the Constitutian of the Commonwealth. See <em>Commissioner of Banks </em>v. <em>Harrigan, </em>291 Mass. 353, 354-355; <em>Bashaw </em>v. <em>Willett, </em>327 Mass. 369, 371-372. Having all these considerations in mind, we hold that \u00a7 97 has no application to proceedings under \u00a7 7, and that the defendant\u2019s appeal to the Superior Court was properly dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-20\">It is not necessary in this proceeding to determine two questions somewhat argued in the briefs of the parties, viz. (1) whether questions of law arising in a proceeding under \u00a7 7 in the District Court may be reviewed by report to the Appellate Division (see G. L. c. 231, \u00a7\u00a7 103 and 108, as amended), and (2) whether such questions of law may be dealt with by petition for a writ of certiorari. See G. L. c. 213, \u00a7 1A, as amended through St. 1941, c. 180; c. 249, \u00a7 4, as amended. 7 , 3 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"Ah6\">7 , <em>Exceptions overruled.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b122-30\">\n<em>Appeal dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"ATrD\"> General Laws c. 117, \u00a7 7 (as amended through St. 1956, c. 156), reads in part: <em>\u201cA justice of a district court in the judicial district in which the person given such relief or support resides, or in the judicial district in which </em>any one of such kindred to be charged resides, upon complaint of any town . . . put to expense for the relief ... of such person, may on due hearing assess and apportion upon such of the kindred as the court finds to be of sufficient ability . . . such amount as the court considers reasonable for or towards the support of the person . . .\u201d (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"AyE\">The italicized words were substituted by St. 1956, c. 156, for the corn-parable words found in \u00a7 7, as amended by St. 1950, c. 485, \u00a7 1, \u201cA justice of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>the superior court or a judge or special judge of a probate court sitting in equity in the county where.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b120-31\">General Laws c. 117, \u00a7 9 (as amended through St. 1928, c. 155, \u00a7 18), reads: \u201c The court may, upon application of any party interested, make further orders, alter such assessment and apportionment according to circumstances, and may order with and by whom of such kindred as desire it such person shall live and be relieved, and the length of time he shall live with different kindred, having regard to the comfort of the person as well as the convenience of the kindred.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b120-38\"> General Laws c. 231, \u00a7 97 (as amended through St. 1931, c. 426, \u00a7 109), reads: \u201cUnless a written waiver of the right of appeal has been filed by all' the parties, \u00e1 party aggrieved by the judgment of a district court in a civil action which could not have been removed to the superior court may appeal therefrom to said court ... in case of a judgment rendered in any other civil action [(the provision here pertinent], within six days after the entry thereof. . . .
