One Sawyer, an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"753\">*753</page-number>electrical engineer employed by the plaintiff, made arrangements through one Logan, a consulting engineer, to have the defendant unload the transformer and place it in position at a site in Lunenburg which had been prepared for it. The site was a \u201ccleared level spot . . . surrounded by a steel fence . . . inside of which were concrete foundations for the transformer.\u201d Sawyer \u201ctook Mr. Williams, a foreman employed by the defendant ... to the site.\u201d He told Williams that because of the proximity of high voltage wires which crossed over the site he did not think a crane could safely be used in unloading the transformer and suggested that \u201cit would have to be rigged.\u201d Williams said that he could do the job.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b791-5\">On December 5, 1951, the transformer was unloaded by the defendant from the freight car onto a truck of the defendant which consisted of a tractor and \u201cflat bed trailer.\u201d The transformer was then transported to the site in Lunenburg. Upon arrival at the site the trailer was backed to the entrance of the enclosure. Then by means of blocks, tackle, rollers and a winch the transformer was \u201cinched\u201d toward the rear of the trailer. As it approached the rear it \u201csuddenly started to fall forward.\u201d It \u201cfell forward under the . . . trailer,\u201d \u201crolled to the left side,\u201d \u201cslid off onto the street,\u201d and was damaged.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-6\">The moving of the transformer was under the supervision of the defendant\u2019s foreman, Williams, and no one employed by the plaintiff gave him any advice or instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-7\">The judge found for the plaintiff and the case comes here on the defendant\u2019s exceptions to the refusal to give certain requests for rulings. In substance these asked the judge to rule that a finding for the plaintiff was not warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-8\">There was no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-9\">We agree, as the defendant argues, that no specific act of negligence on the part of the defendant was shown. And <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"754\">*754</page-number>we agree that the mere happening of an accident ordinarily is not sufficient to warrant a finding of negligence. But an accident may be of a kind that in the ordinary course of things would not have happened in the absence of negligence on the part of the person in control of the agency or instrumentality causing it. We are of opinion that this is such a case and that the judge was warranted in inferring that the defendant was negligent. The moving of the transformer at all times here relevant was under the direction and control of the defendant. See <em>Roscigno </em>v. <em>Colonial Beacon Oil Co. </em>294 Mass. 234, 235. The case is governed in principle by <em>DiRoberto </em>v. <em>Lagasse, </em>336 Mass. 309, and <em>Poulin </em>v. <em>H. A. Tobey Lumber Corp. </em>337 Mass. 146, and cases there collected, rather than by <em>Bloom </em>v. <em>Warshaw, </em>332 Mass. 14, and <em>Wardwell </em>v. <em>George H. Taylor Co. </em>333 Mass. 302, cited by the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-5\">t<em>Exceptions overruled.</em></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b791-10\"> It was conceded that Williams was authorized by the defendant to accept the job of moving the transformer and that \u201cwhat Williams did, the defendant did.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
