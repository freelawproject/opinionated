A final decree dismissed the bill as against the defendant American Automobile Insurance Company (hereinafter called American) and ordered the defendant United States Casualty Company (hereinafter called Casualty) to pay to the plaintiff $1,876.56 with interest and costs. Casualty appealed. The facts are stated on the basis of the trial judge\u2019s report of material facts. The evidence is not reported.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-4\">The plaintiff recovered judgment against one Marnoy for personal injuries and property damage caused by Marnoy\u2019s negligence on a public way in Massachusetts. Marnoy, at the time of the accident employed by Morton\u2019s Inc., was acting within the scope of his employment in operating a truck owned by Bern\u2019s Auto &amp; Truck Renting Co., Inc. (hereinafter called Renting). Throughout the period during which the accident occurred this truck was leased by Renting to \u201cand regularly used exclusively on the business of Morton\u2019s Inc.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b565-5\">At all pertinent times Casualty had in full effect a policy issued to Renting, providing (a) statutory (compulsory) coverage A; (b) increased bodily injury limits of $25,000 for each person and $50,000 for each accident as coverage B; and (c) property damage liability coverage C of $5,000 for each accident. In addition to statutory provisions Casualty\u2019s policy provided: pU] \u201cWith respect to the insurance under coverages B and C the . . . word \u2018insured\u2019 includes the named insured and . . . any other person responsible for the operation of the . . . vehicle with the . . . consent of the named insured. . . . [Y1 This policy does not apply: (d) under coverages B, C and D, to liability assumed by the insured under any contract or agreement. . . . [Z] 9. Other insurance. Under coverages A, B and C if the insured has other insurance against a loss covered by this policy the company shall not be liable under this policy for a greater propor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>tian of such loss than the applicable limit of liability stated in the declarations bears to the total applicable limit of liability of all valid and collectible insurance against such loss.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AV9T\">American had in full effect a policy issued to Morton\u2019s Inc. providing (a) statutory coverage; (b) increased bodily injury liability limits of $100,000 for each person and $300,000 for each accident as coverage B; and (c) property damage liability coverage Oof $50,000 for each accident. \u201cThe truck involved in the accident was not a . . . vehicle described . . . except under the classification of commercial automobiles hired.\u201d In addition to statutory provisions American\u2019s policy contained substantially (a) the definition of \u201cinsured\u201d under coverages B and C contained in Casualty\u2019s policy and quoted above as passage [XI, and (b) the provision contained in Casualty\u2019s policy with respect to \u201cother insurance,\u201d quoted above as passage [Z], It did not contain the words (with respect to liability assumed by the insured by contract) quoted above as passage [Y] but did contain as a proviso to the \u201cother insurance\u201d clause, quoted as passage <em>[ZJ, </em>the words set out in the margin.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> American\u2019s policy also contained a special indorsement entitled \u201chired automobiles\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> set out in the margin.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>Under a truck rental contract between Renting and Morton\u2019s Inc. in force at the time of the accident Renting agreed \u201cto carry insurance for public liability, property damage, fire and theft . . . and ... to assume all liability and save the lessee harmless from claims, liability . . . and cost resulting from accidents . . . other than for wilful collision and other malicious action ... of the lessee, his agents or servants.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b567-5\">Casualty voluntarily paid one half of the plaintiff\u2019s judgment. Casualty and American each refused the plaintiff\u2019s demand for payment of the remaining $1,876.56. The trial judge found that \u201cthe coverage provided by . . . American ... is excess coverage over and above, and not concurrent with, the coverage of . . . Casualty . . . and that the latter is solely responsible to the plaintiff for the unpaid balance of his judgment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b567-6\">1. Marnoy was an unnamed insured under American\u2019s policy and also under Casualty\u2019s policy with respect to coverages A, B, and C. He was operating the truck \u201cwith the express or implied consent\u201d of his employer, Morton\u2019s Inc., and of Renting<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> which had leased the truck for use by Morton\u2019s Inc. and its employees. With respect to coverages B and C he came within the definition of \u201cinsured\u201d under passage [X] already quoted and with respect to statutory compulsory coverage A he was within the definition of \u201cany person responsible for the operation of the insured\u2019s motor vehicle with bis express or implied consent.\u201d See G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 34A (as amended through St. 1949, c. 571, \u00a7 1); <em>Crompton </em>v. <em>Lumbermens Mut. Cas. Co. </em>333 Mass. 160.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-7\">2. The trial judge\u2019s conclusion that \u201cthe coverage . . . of ... American ... is excess coverage over and above . . . the coverage of . . . Casualty\u201d is unexplained by him, and we have not had any brief or argument in behalf of American. The relatively few provisions of the two <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>policies appearing in the record nowhere purport to make any coverage of either policy \u201cexcess\u201d coverage, except the proviso of the \u201cother insurance\u201d clause of American\u2019s policy. This proviso refers only to insurance under insuring agreements IV and V (see footnote 2, <em>supra). </em>Neither such agreement seems to have application here, insuring agreement IV because it relates only to \u201csubstitute\u201d vehicles \u201ctemporarily used\u201d and insuring agreement V because it refers only to insured individual or family vehicles classified \u201cpleasure and business. \u201d On this record, therefore, there is no applicable contractual provision of either policy making any relevant coverage under one policy \u201cexcess\u201d to any coverage under the other. Cf. clauses quoted in <em>O\u2019Brien </em>v. <em>Ready, </em>331 Mass. 204, 209, footnote 1. The record also shows no applicable contractual limitation of coverage A, B, or C in American\u2019s policy. In the absence of any such contractual provisions, this case is governed by the principles discussed in <em>Kenner </em>v. <em>Century Indem. Co. </em>320 Mass. 6, 14-15 (par. 7), where both policies contained an \u201cother insurance\u201d clause substantially identical to those in the two policies here considered. The plaintiff there seeking to reach and apply the proceeds of the two policies was allowed to recover against each of the insurers one half of the judgment, interest, and costs under the only coverage (A) upon which both insurers were liable.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> See <em>Celina Mut. Cas. Co. </em>v. <em>Citizens Cas. Co. </em>194 Md. 236, 241-245. The trial judge\u2019s subsidiary findings about the two policies do not support the ultimate finding that the coverage under American\u2019s policy was \u201cexcess coverage.\u201d The ultimate finding cannot stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-5\">3. Morton\u2019s Inc. and Renting are not parties. There is no occasion to consider in this proceeding the effect of the lease provision, mentioned above, by which Renting agreed to carry certain insurance and to save Morton\u2019s Inc. harm<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>less against certain liabilities. Since Casualty makes no contention that American is bound to pay more than half the total liability to the plaintiff by reason of the judgment, there is also no occasion to consider whether, because the coverage limits other than under coverage A in American\u2019s policy were higher than in Casualty\u2019s policy, the apportionment of liability should be any more favorable to Casualty.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-4\">4. The decree is to be reversed as against both defendants. A new decree is to be entered (a) adjudging that there is owing from American to the plaintiff the sum of $1,876.56 with interest from the date of judgment, January 20, 1953, and costs, and (b) dismissing the bill against Casualty, which is to have costs of this appeal, to be paid by American.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-5\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b566-4\"> The proviso reads: \u201cprovided, however, the insurance with respect to temporary substitute motor vehicles under insuring agreement IV or other motor vehicles under insuring agreement V shall be excess insurance over any other valid and collectible insurance available to the insured, either to said motor vehicles or otherwise.\u201d The two insuring agreements (IV and V referred to in the proviso) read in part: \u201cInsuring Agreement IV (3) Temporary substitute motor vehicle under coverage B, C and D, a motor vehicle not owned by the named insured while temporarily used as the substitute for the described motor vehicle while withdrawn from normal use because of its breakdown, repair, servicing, loss or destruction. . . .
