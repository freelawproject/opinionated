Each indictment contained an allegation that between September 23, 1942, and the date of the indictment the petitioner \u201cwas not usually and publicly resident within the said Commonwealth.\u201d During the greater part of that time the petitioner was confined in prison in Rhode Island for crime committed in that State.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-5\">On March 21, 1952, after a trial in which he was represented by experienced and competent counsel, the petitioner was found guilty on the three aforementioned indictments and was sentenced to a term in State prison on each, which he is now serving.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-6\">In the petition the only error assigned is that the three indictments \u201care illegal and contrary\u201d to the statutes of the Commonwealth and to the Constitution of the Commonwealth and of the United States. The petitioner now concedes that the indictments were not improper. We agree.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b70-7\">At the hearing before the single justice the petitioner presented a much broader question, namely, that the statute of limitations (G. L. c. 277, \u00a7 63) was not tolled during the period of his incarceration in Rhode Island.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-8\">From evidence introduced before him the single justice found these facts. \u201cOn September 30, 1942, . . . [the petitioner] was employed and resided in Taunton in this Commonwealth. On that night, police officers from Providence, Rhode Island, without a warrant went to the room where . . . [the petitioner] was living, and took him and one Howarth, who was asleep there, to the Taunton police station. Later that night, still without a warrant, the Providence police took . . . [the petitioner] and Howarth to Rhode Island.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b70-9\">The single justice ruled, in ordering the judgments affirmed, that during the period of his imprisonment in Rhode Island the petitioner was not \u201cusually and publicly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>resident within the Commonwealth\u201d within the purview of G. L. c. 277, \u00a7 63, and that the conduct of the Rhode Island police did not affect the right of this Commonwealth to prosecute for the crimes covered by the three indictments. The petitioner challenges this ruling. It is not disputed that if the statute of limitations was not tolled during the period of the petitioner\u2019s imprisonment in Rhode Island the petitioner would have had a good defence.</p>\n<p id=\"AC1\">The issue of the statute of hmitations was a defence which the petitioner could and should have raised at the trial. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Cook, 17 </em>Wall. 168. <em>Biddinger </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Police of N. Y. </em>245 U. S. 128, 135. <em>Forthoffer </em>v. <em>Swope, </em>103 F. 2d 707, 709 (9th Cir.). <em>United States </em>v. <em>Parrino, </em>203 F. 2d 284, 286-287 (2d Cir.), cert. den. sub nom. <em>Parrino </em>v. <em>United States, </em>348 U. S. 840. <em>Lincoln </em>v. <em>State, </em>199 Md. 194, 202. Speaking broadly, the review under a writ of error \u201cis of matters of law apparent on the record of the court in which the judgment was entered as disclosed by the return.\u201d <em>Berlandi </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>314 Mass. 424, 427. \u201cIt is a restricted remedy. \u2018Evidence heard at the trial on the merits is no part of the record and hence cannot be considered on a writ of error.\u2019 \u201d <em>Guerin </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>337 Mass. 264, 268. The errors of fact which may be reviewed on a writ of error are set forth in detail in the case just cited at page 268. The issue sought to be raised here does not come within any of the classes there enumerated. The record of the Superior Court reveals nothing that has any bearing on the issue of the subject of the statute of limitations and hence there is nothing apparent on the record touching this issue which may be reviewed. A party seeking relief by writ of error under the statutory authority must take the remedy with its hmitations. <em>Dolan </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>304 Mass. 325, 333. The petitioner was not without an adequate remedy. He could have brought the cases here as matter of right either by exceptions (G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 31), or by appeal if they were made subject to G. L. c. 278, \u00a7\u00a7 33A-33G, as amended, and in either case could <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>have had a review much broader than that afforded by a writ of error, but he did not see fit to do so. We are of opinion that the petitioner was not entitled to raise the questian here sought to be raised on a writ of error. However, since the result will be the same and the question is one which this court has never passed on, we shall proceed to the'merits. There was no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-6\">General Laws (Ter. Ed.) c. 277, \u00a7 63, provides in part: \u201cAn indictment for any other crime [than murder] shall be found and filed within six years after the crime has been committed; <em>but any period during which the defendant is not usually and publicly resident within the commonwealth shall be excluded in determining the time </em>limited\u201d (emphasis supplied). The issue, then, is whether the petitioner was \u201cnot usually and publicly resident within the commonwealth\u201d for a time sufficient to prevent the expiration of the period of limitation. The petitioner was not \u201cusually and publicly resident\u201d within this Commonwealth during the time he was imprisoned in Rhode Island, unless the Legislature can be said to have contemplated that only periods of <em>voluntary </em>absence will toll the statute. The statute, however, is unambiguous; it provides that the period of limitation is tolled during <em>any </em>period a person accused of crime is absent from the Commonwealth. There is no warrant here for the introduction of an exception not specified or contemplated by the Legislature. Decisions in other jurisdictions with similar statutory provisions support this conclusion. <em>People </em>v. <em>Carman, </em>385 Ill. 23. <em>Traxler </em>v. <em>State, </em>96 Okla. Cr. 231, 236-238. And see <em>McCowen </em>v. <em>United States, </em>105 F. 2d 791 (D. C. Cir.), cert. den. 308 U. S. 552; <em>Green </em>v. <em>United States, </em>188 F. 2d 48 (D. C. Cir.); <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>United States, </em>238 F. 2d 259, 260 (D. C. Cir.).</p>\n<p id=\"b72-27\">That the petitioner may have considered Taunton as his domicil during the entire period of his imprisonment in Rhode Island and that he may have never intended to change his legal residence is irrelevant here. It may be readily conceded that a person\u2019s domicil is unaffected by an involuntary absence. However, the words of \u00a7 63 under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>consideration are not to be equated with domicil. See <em>People </em>v. <em>Carmen, </em>385 Ill. 23.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-5\">The petitioner\u2019s final contention is that the Commonwealth is estopped from prosecuting him for crimes committed in Massachusetts because he was forcibly taken from this jurisdiction to Rhode Island by Rhode Island officers to stand trial there. There is no merit in this contention. We need not decide whether there might be situations where the Commonwealth had participated in the illegal seizure and removal of a defendant to such an extent that it could not in fairness avail itself of the exception tolling the statute, for the record here does not reveal anything of that sort. \u2014 .. 7 ,</p>\n<p id=\"b73-6\">7 <em>Exceptions overruled.</em></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b70-10\"> We do not intimate that it was necessary for the Commonwealth to plead, as it did in the indictments, the exception tolling the statute. See G. L. c. 277, \u00a7 37; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hart, </em>11 Cush. 130; <em>Murray </em>v. <em>Continental Ins. Co. </em>313 Mass. 557, 563; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Cook, </em>17 Wall. 168. But see <em>State </em>v. <em>Snyder, </em>182 Mo. 462; <em>State </em>v. <em>Steensland, </em>33 Idaho, 529.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
