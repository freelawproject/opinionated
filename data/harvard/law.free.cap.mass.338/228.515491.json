One Thomas, the local representative of the employer, arrived upon the scene within a few minutes and ordered Davidson to continue his journey and put his truck up at the garage, which the employee did. Davidson\u2019s foot became swollen and painful and was bathed each day. It became worse and his limp became more noticeable although he worked until noon of Friday, December 5, 1952, when he was sent home by Thomas. This was the last time he worked. Although he had for years worked alone, Thomas supplied him with a helper, one Pettingill, on December 1, 1952, who thereafter continued as such as long as Davidson remained in the employ of the express company. Pettingill knew that Davidson was having trouble with his right foot and saw him in the office of a chiropodist on December 5, 1952. He was later seen by a Dr. Christopher who immediately sent him to a hospital where two successive operations were performed on his right leg. Davidson was found to be suffering from \u201cdiabetes mellitus and gangrene of the right toe and foot, complicated by severe infection of the amputated stump which necessitated high mid thigh amputation. \u201d Thomas learned from the employee\u2019s wife on December 7, 1952, that Davidson was in the hospital, and Thomas sent her blanks to be executed by Davidson who was a member of a group of employees of the employer who were insured in a regular insurance company, which thereafter made several payments to Davidson. It does not appear why no further payments were made unless it was because this insurance did not cover claims under the workmen\u2019s compensation act. Davidson did not give any written notice and made claim about twenty months after the injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-6\">The self insurer does not contend that the claimant\u2019s in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>jury did not arise out of and in the course of his employment, and since there is evidence upon which the board\u2019s affirmative finding in this respect can be based, it will not be disturbed. <em>Pigeon\u2019s Case, </em>216 Mass. 51, 52. <em>Brown\u2019s Case, </em>334 Mass. 343, 346.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-5\">The self insurer does contend, however, that it was without knowledge of the injury and was prejudiced by the lack of notice of the injury and by the late filing of the claim for compensation. The failure of an employee to give written notice of his injury to the employer or insurer \u201cas soon as practicable after the happening thereof, \u201d G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 41, and to file a claim within six months after the occurrence of the injury, \u00a7 41, does not bar him from maintaining proceedings for compensation if the employer or insurer had knowledge of the injury or was not prejudiced by the lack of timely notice, \u00a7 44, or if his failure to make claim seasonably was due to mistake or other reasonable cause, or if the insurer was not prejudiced by the delay in filing the claim, \u00a7 49. On the issue of notice, the single member found \u201cthat the employee has shown affirmatively that the self insurer has not been prejudiced for want of due notice\u201d because it had sufficient knowledge through Thomas \u201cfor them to have looked into the matter if they had so desired.\u201d With respect to the late fifing of the claim, the member found \u201cthat the employee, through a misunderstanding, was collecting benefits under a group insurance policy and, therefore, had no reason for filing a claim at an earlier date. I find that the self insurer has not been prejudiced in any way and the defence . . . has no merit whatsoever. \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b268-6\">It is well settled that the burden of proving that the insurer has not been prejudiced by the failure of the employee to give timely notice rests upon the employee. <em>Russell\u2019s Case, </em>334 Mass. 680, 682. In proving lack of prejudice a claimant is not required \u201c\u2018to exhaust the possibilities of prejudice and displace them . . . <em>Kangas\u2019s Case, </em>282 Mass. 155, 158. \u201cThe burden is sustained if he introduces evidence from which a reasonable inference can be drawn that the insurer suffered no prejudice. \u201d <em>Zabec\u2019s Case, </em>302 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>Mass. 465, 469. Furthermore, \u201c[t]he circumstances, without evidence directed to disproving particular forms of prejudice, may of themselves warrant an inference by the board of want of prejudice.\u201d <em>Russell\u2019s Case, </em>334 Mass. 680, 683. It is a question of fact, <em>Berthiaume\u2019s Case, </em>328 Mass. 186, 191, and the findings of the board in this regard will not be upset if there is evidence to support them, <em>Zabec\u2019s Case, </em>302 Mass. 465, 469; they must stand if they can be supported on any rational view of the evidence. <em>Wnukowski\u2019s Case, </em>296 Mass. 63, 64.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-5\">Thomas was the authorized agent of the company and was in charge of its local office. His knowledge, therefore, can be regarded as the knowledge of the company. <em>Walkden\u2019s Case, </em>237 Mass. 115, 117. This court has frequently held that where a supervisory employee has observed the claimant\u2019s symptoms in such circumstances as would indicate that they are the result of an accident or disease arising out of and in the course of the claimant\u2019s employment, such observation is imputable as knowledge of the employer under \u00a7 44 of the statute. See, e.g., <em>Lapan\u2019s Case, </em>237 Mass. 340; <em>Dorney\u2019s Case, </em>259 Mass. 350, 353; <em>Gustafson\u2019s Case, </em>303 Mass. 397; <em>Perrotta\u2019s Case, </em>318 Mass. 737, 739; <em>Morrison\u2019s Case, </em>332 Mass. 658.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-6\">The self insurer contended in effect that it was misled and prejudiced by the employee\u2019s action in filing an application for insurance under his group insurance policy which did not cover injuries for which benefits were payable under the workmen\u2019s compensation act. The single member\u2019s finding adopted by the board was that the collection of benefits under the policy was \u201cthrough a misunderstanding\u201d of the employee and that the employee had no reason for filing a claim at an earlier date. There was evidence which warranted this finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-7\">Similarly the findings with respect to lack of prejudice, supported as they are by evidence upon which the inference of no prejudice may rest, must be affirmed. \u201cThe usual forms of prejudice to the insurer are the failure of the employee to be treated medically promptly after the in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>jury, and the inability of the insurer to procure evidence because of the delay in learning of the injury.\u201d <em>Kulig\u2019s Case, </em>331 Mass. 524, 526. Since it does not appear that Davidson\u2019s ailment could have been cured or the complications prevented had prompt notice of the injury been given, there is no evidence that the insurer has been prejudiced in this respect. <em>Gustafson\u2019s Case, </em>303 Mass. 397. On the contrary, there was evidence that the employee received prompt and adequate medical care. Since it also does not appear that prompt investigation would have disclosed anything more favorable to the insurer in the way of the cause of the employee\u2019s ailment, neither was the insurer prejudiced with respect to the procuring of evidence. See <em>Kangas\u2019s Case, </em>282 Mass. 155. And with regard to the accident itself the employer was not hampered from making a prompt and full investigation thereof. We cannot say in all the circumstances that there was no evidence for the board\u2019s finding that neither failure to give notice nor the late filing of claim was prejudicial to the employer. <em>Zabec\u2019s Case, </em>302 Mass. 465. <em>Gustafson\u2019s Case, </em>303 Mass. 397. <em>Davis\u2019s Case, </em>304 Mass. 530. <em>Wheaton\u2019s Case, </em>310 Mass. 504. <em>Duggan\u2019s Case, </em>315 Mass. 355, 359. <em>Perrotta\u2019s Case, </em>318 Mass. 737, 739. <em>Watson\u2019s Case, </em>322 Mass. 581, 584-585. <em>Tassone\u2019s Case, </em>330 Mass. 545. <em>Charron\u2019s Case, </em>331 Mass. 519, 521. <em>Kulig\u2019s Case, </em>331 Mass. 524. <em>Morrison\u2019s Case, </em>332 Mass. 658. <em>Brown\u2019s Case, </em>334 Mass. 343. <em>Channell\u2019s Case, </em>337 Mass. 124. Compare <em>Russell\u2019s Case, </em>334 Mass. 680.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-5\">The decree is affirmed. Costs of the appeal are to be determined by the single justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
