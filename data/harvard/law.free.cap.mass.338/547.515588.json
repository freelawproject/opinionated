The defendants appeal from a final decree permanently enjoining them from keeping swine on certain premises in Woburn and from transporting offensive substances through the streets of Woburn, without in each instance obtaining a permit as required by regulations of the board.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> \u201cSince the judge made no report of the material facts, the entry of the decree imported a finding of every fact essential to sustain it and within the scope of the pleadings.\u201d <em>Marlowe </em>v. <em>O\u2019Brien, </em>321 Mass. 384, 386. The evidence, mainly oral, is reported. We cannot say that the judge would have been plainly wrong in concluding (1) that the pertinent regulations had been duly adopted; and (2) that the defendants since about October 30, 1957, had been keeping about one thousand swine on their premises and transporting offensive materials through the streets without obtaining permits.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-8\">1. Although the board of health had authority to institute a suit for the city, it should have been brought in the name of the city. An amendment may be allowed for this purpose, even though the point is not now raised. See <em>Board of Health of Wareham </em>v. <em>Marine By-Products Co. </em>329 Mass. 174, 175.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-9\">2. The board of health of a city or town, pursuant to at least three legislative delegations of power, may require a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>permit for keeping swine. G. L. c. Ill, \u00a7\u00a7 31, 122, 143, as amended. See \u00a7\u00a7 146, 147, as amended.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b587-4\">The authority to make the regulation has usually been found in \u00a7 143, or in one of its predecessors. In <em>Quincy </em>v. <em>Kennard, </em>151 Mass. 563, it was held within the power of a board of health to require a permit for the keeping of swine as a condition of doing what could have been absolutely prohibited. In considering comparable regulations in <em>Lexington </em>v. <em>Miskell, </em>260 Mass. 544, 546-547, and in <em>Waltham </em>v. <em>Mignosa, </em>327 Mass. 250, 252-254, \u00a7 31 was referred to in addition to \u00a7 143. The <em>Lexington </em>case also referred to \u00a7 122. References by the court to the remedy provided by \u00a7 147 perhaps imply that the respective regulations were considered as adopted under \u00a7 143. In <em>Swansea </em>v. <em>Pivo, </em>265 Mass. 520, 521, 523, the conduct of the board in enforcing its regulation showed that it was acting under \u00a7\u00a7 143 and 146, regardless of whether it had adopted its regulation under \u00a7 31, \u00a7 122, or \u00a7 143. In <em>Cochis </em>v. <em>Board of Health of </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number><em>Canton, </em>332 Mass. 721, 722, this court (at p. 724), while recognizing that \u00a7 31 authorized \u201cboards of health to make reasonable regulations,\u201d stated that \u00a7 143 was a section authorizing \u201csuch boards to make specific prohibitions\u201d (emphasis supplied). It indicated that it was under \u00a7 143 that \u201cthe board presumably acted in promulgating . . . regulations\u201d absolutely prohibiting piggeries. Cf. <em>Board of Health of Wareham </em>v. <em>Marine By-Products Co. </em>329 Mass. 174, 178, a proceeding under \u00a7 143, not involving piggeries.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-5\">The regulations of the Woburn board of health were adopted April 27, 1953. When published, reference was made to \u00a7\u00a7 31, 122, and 143, among other sections of c. Ill, as providing authority for the regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-6\">Prior to St. 1920, c. 591, \u00a7 17, authority to regulate piggeries by a permit could have been found in the predecessors of \u00a7\u00a7 122 and 143 (see R. L. c. 75, \u00a7\u00a7 65, 91). Section 17, by enacting what is now c. Ill, \u00a7 31, provided a comprehensive, separate, additional source of authority for health regulations. The new section had been recommended by the commission (see St. 1919, c. 248) to complete the work of revising and codifying the laws relating to towns. Its report (1920 Senate Doc. No. 2, p. 14) said, \u201cThe provisions of law are such that considerable doubt has arisen with regard to the powers of the board of health to make regulations. In order to make matters clear the commission recommends the passage of section 24 of the general bill\u201d (p. 27)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> attached to the commission\u2019s report.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-7\">In the present case, the board of health has not proceeded to enforce its regulation under \u00a7\u00a7 143 and 146. No order of prohibition appears to have been served upon the defendants under \u00a7 146, which provides one method for enforcing a regulation adopted under \u00a7 143. We therefore consider <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>whether these regulations could have been adopted under \u00a7 31 and \u00a7 122, as well as under \u00a7 143, and whether, regardless of the section under which they were adopted, they can be enforced in equity under G. L. c. Ill, \u00a7 187,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> without compliance with \u00a7\u00a7 143 and 146.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-4\">In <em>Malden </em>v. <em>Flynn, </em>318 Mass. 276, 277-279, it was held that after the enactment in 1937 of the specific provisions of \u00a7 31A (see amendment by St. 1945, c. 423) and \u00a7 31B (inserted by St. 1937, c. 282) the \"authority of boards of health to prohibit absolutely ... by a general regulation the transportation of garbage . . . formerly possessed by virtue of what is now ... \u00a7 122, no longer exists.\u201d This court took the position that the subject matter was thereafter controlled by the very specific provisions on this subject of \u00a7 31A and \u00a7 31B which had in effect (at p. 278) \"carved out of the general power of boards of health over nuisances . . . the power to deal with the . . . transportation of garbage, and the authority of boards over this particular subject.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The <em>Malden </em>case suggests the question whether \u00a7\u00a7 143, 146, and 147 and related sections so completely deal with noisome trades like piggeries as to preclude the adoption of regulations regulating, but not prohibiting, such trades under \u00a7\u00a7 31 and 122. We need not decide whether complete prohibition of all piggeries can be dealt with only under \u00a7 143. There is, in any event, no express statutory indication that regulation of piggeries, by requiring permits, may not be undertaken under \u00a7\u00a731 and 122. As has been noted, \u00a7 31 was passed as legislation of broad and general scope, after the predecessors of \u00a7\u00a7 143, 146, and 147 had been on the statute books for many years. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>The legislative history (see footnote 3, <em>supra, </em>and the text to which it relates) shows no purpose to limit its scope. See <em>Brielman </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Pub. Health of Pittsfield, </em>301 Mass. 407, 409, which refers to \u00a7 17 of the 1920 statute as establishing a \u201cbroad power\u201d which is \u201cnot subject to the limitations of earlier rule making powers of boards of health.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b590-4\">The requirement of a permit is a traditional method of regulation, and a regulation calling for a permit certainly may be adopted where there exists some statutory delegation of authority (as here may be found in \u00a7 143) to prohibit absolutely. See <em>Butler </em>v. <em>East Bridgewater, </em>330 Mass. 33, 36-38, where, as here, the power to prohibit existed. In that case, instead of an absolute prohibition, the town required only a permit and invested the licensing authority \u201cwith quasi judicial authority to determine the facts and to pass upon the application [jfor a permitj[ in each instance under the serious sense of responsibility imposed upon them by their official positions and the delicate character of the duty entrusted to them.\u201d In that case, also, the court distinguished <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Maletsky, </em>203 Mass. 241, <em>Goldstein </em>v. <em>Conner, </em>212 Mass. 57, and <em>Kilgour </em>v. <em>Gratto, </em>224 Mass. 78, on grounds which are applicable in the present case. It is immaterial, in determining whether a regulation requiring a permit for a piggery may be adopted under \u00a7\u00a731 and 122, that absolute statutory power to prohibit piggeries (which reinforces the power to require a permit) exists most clearly under another section (\u00a7 143). We hold that the regulations relating to piggeries (see footnote 1, <em>supra) </em>could properly have been adopted under \u00a7 31 and \u00a7 122, and that enforcement of such regulations is permitted under \u00a7 187 (see footnote 4, <em>supra).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b590-5\">The provisions of \u00a7\u00a7 146 and 147 in terms apply only to orders under \u00a7 143. See <em>DeVincent </em>v. <em>Public Welfare Commn. of Waltham, </em>319 Mass. 170, 171. We hold that these sections have no necessary application to the enforcement of general regulations valid under \u00a7\u00a7 31 and 122, unless the method of enforcement in fact adopted by the appropriate public authorities is that under \u00a7 146.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>3. The evidence would justify findings that the defendants moved some one thousand pigs to the premises here in question, purchased by them in late October or November, 1957, without obtaining a permit to keep them there.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-4\">Applications for permits to keep the pigs on these premises were not filed until February, 1958, nearly three months after this bill was filed. The board of health has taken no action on these applications.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-5\">Obviously, if the board of health should fail to act upon the defendants\u2019 applications, the injunction ordered by the final decree would give to the board\u2019s inaction the effect of a complete prohibition without the consideration by the board impliedly called for by the regulation. A board which has power to grant or withhold a permit must decide \u201cin a fair, judicial and reasonable manner upon the evidence as presented . . . keeping in mind the objects\u201d of the applicable regulation. <em>Butler </em>v. <em>East Bridgewater, </em>330 Mass. 33, 38. Complete inaction may be as arbitrary as affirmative action. To be sure, a board which does not act promptly may be compelled to act by mandamus. G. L. c. 249, \u00a7 5 (as amended through St. 1943, c. 374, \u00a7 2). Also, if the board\u2019s decision<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> reveals errors of law, the remedy by certiorari is available. <em>Butler </em>v. <em>East Bridgewater, </em>330 Mass. 33, 39. See <em>Tracht </em>v. <em>County Commrs. of Worcester, </em>318 Mass. 681, 685-687. Of course, in passing upon applications for a permit, the board of health may take into account all relevant considerations of public health, safety, and welfare which bear upon whether, in an expanding community, piggeries in addition to any now permitted should be conducted. It is improper, however, for a board simply to fail to act at all on applications for permits.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-8\">The defendants contend that the board of health was determined not to grant a permit to the defendants and that evidence to that effect was improperly excluded. See, however, <em>Swansea </em>v. <em>Pivo, </em>265 Mass. 520, 523. The evidence was irrelevant here in a proceeding to enforce a regulation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>which the defendants had disregarded until they had confronted the board of health with the accomplished fact of the presence of one thousand pigs on the land. As to the future, it is not to be assumed that the board of health will not apply proper principles, now that those principles have been indicated, in considering any appropriate applications for permits after there has been compliance by the defendants with the regulation. <em>Brookline </em>v. <em>Co-Ray Realty Co. Inc. </em>326 Mass. 206, 214, and cases cited. In view of the defendants\u2019 conduct, this is not an occasion where we should impose conditions on injunctive relief. Cf. <em>Jurewicz </em>v. <em>Jurewicz, </em>317 Mass. 512, 517; <em>Kressler </em>v. <em>Flynn, </em>323 Mass. 610, 612-613.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-4\">4. The decree is affirmed.
