Outside of the club, and elsewhere, the plaintiff and the defendant engaged in further encounters, both physical and verbal, over the girl. Finally, the defendant made off in his automobile with the girl and the plaintiff followed in his automobile in order to catch up <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>with the defendant, who had entered Cocasset Street. After traveling along Cocasset Street for \u201cbetter than a mile,\u201d the plaintiff observed the defendant\u2019s automobile for the first time \u201ctraveling on its right hand side\u201d of the road. The plaintiff\u2019s speed at this point was \u201cforty to fifty miles per hour, maybe better.\u201d The plaintiff came up to within twenty feet of the defendant\u2019s automobile at the end of an \u201cS\u201d curve. At the \u201cbeginning of the straight stretch of road, at the end of the curve, the plaintiff pulled over to his left of the road, and blinked his lights, and started to pass.\u201d The defendant\u2019s automobile, \u201cthen being operated in the center of the road, speeded up and pulled to the defendant\u2019s right, the plaintiff having plenty of room to pass.\u201d The plaintiff \u201ccontinued straight ahead on the left side of the road, and the defendant continued straight ahead in the middle of the road until the plaintiff lost sight of him.\u201d \u201cpVTJost of [the] defendant\u2019s automobile . . . [was] on its own right side of the road.\u201d The plaintiff did not \u201c observe the defendant doing anything except driving straight ahead.\u201d When the plaintiff\u2019s \u201cright front fender drew abreast of the rear of the defendant\u2019s left rear fender, and \u2018there was a distance of twenty-five feet between the two cars\u2019 the plaintiff felt a bump and the next thing he knew \u2018he awoke in the hospital.\u2019\u201d The \u201cleft rear of the defendant\u2019s car and the right front of [the] plaintiff\u2019s car had come\u2018in contact.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b206-28\">A police officer testified that after the accident he \u201cobserved the left front of [the] plaintiff\u2019s car in contact with a telephone pole situated ... off [and to the left of <footnotemark>1</footnotemark>] the traveled portion of the way.\u201d He found no skid marks on the roadway but he observed \u201ca mark\u201d parallel to the roadway and six to eight inches off to the side which \u201cstopped one and one half feet to two feet to the rear of [the] plaintiff\u2019s car.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b206-36\">On cross-examination the plaintiff admitted that he was following the defendant\u2019s automobile \u201cintending to stop him and have a fight with him.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b207-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>The defendant testified that he first observed the plaintiff\u2019s automobile on Cocasset Street when it was two hundred to three hundred feet behind him; that he (the defendant) at that time was going thirty-five to forty miles per hour and was traveling on the right side of the road. \u201cHe moved the left wheel of his car slightly to the left of the center of the road, and continued in this position for one hundred fifty to two hundred feet when he felt a bump.\u201d Prior to \u201cfeeling the bump he had accelerated his car when [the] plaintiff\u2019s car was ten to twenty feet to the rear of his vehicle.\u201d The plaintiff\u2019s automobile was under the defendant\u2019s observation until it was four to five feet to the rear of, and slightly more to the left side of the road than, the defendant\u2019s automobile. The defendant left the scene of the accident without</p>\n<p id=\"b207-5\">A plaintiff is not required to exclude every possible cause for his injuries other than the negligence of the defendant. It is sufficient to show that there was a greater likelihood that the accident was caused by the defendant\u2019s negligence than from some other cause. <em>Rocha </em>v. <em>Alber, </em>302 Mass. 155, 157-158. <em>Sargent </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Acc. Co. </em>307 Mass. 246, 250-251. <em>Howard </em>v. <em>Lowell Coca-Cola Bottling Co. </em>322 Mass. 456. But it is equally well settled that a verdict must rest on something more than surmise or conjecture. In this case the evidence left the cause of the accident to conjecture. <em>Helie </em>v. <em>Goldstein, ante, </em>22, and cases cited. The entire evidence with regard to the impact of the two vehicles, considered in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, merely showed that the plaintiff started to pass the defendant at the beginning of a straight stretch of road; that the plaintiff, traveling at a higher speed than the defendant, \u201cpulled over to his left\u201d; that the plaintiff had plenty of room to pass; that the defendant continued straight ahead in the middle of the road until the plaintiff lost sight of him; that there was a contact between the right front of the plaintiff\u2019s automobile and the left rear of the defendant\u2019s automobile; and that the left front of the plaintiff\u2019s vehicle collided with a telephone pole three feet off the traveled portion of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>way. It cannot reasonably be said from this evidence that it is more probable than not that an act of the defendant caused the impact between the two vehicles rather than an act of the plaintiff. We attach no significance to the testimony of the police officer that he observed \u201ca mark\u201d parallel to the roadway which stopped one and one half to two feet from the rear of the plaintiff\u2019s automobile. There is no evidence that this was a tire mark or that it was made by the defendant\u2019s automobile. The total effect of the evidence in the case leaves the cause of the accident shrouded in mystery and doubt. Even if we infer that the impact was caused by some act of the defendant, there is no evidence, however slight, from which to conclude that such act was negligent. The defendant\u2019s motion for a directed verdict should have been granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-5\">In view of the foregoing conclusion we do not reach the question of contributory negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-6\">\n<em>Exceptions sustained.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b208-7\">\n<em>Judgment for the defendant.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b206-39\"> This appears from, photographs taken after the accident which are before us.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
