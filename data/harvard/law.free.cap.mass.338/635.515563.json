The department of public welfare eventually<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> filed a report disapproving the proposed adoption. The natural parents of the child were not married to each other at the time of the child\u2019s birth or when the petition was filed but were married November 30, 1956, some seven and one half months after the filing of the petition. They opposed the adoption, although the mother had consented in writing to the adoption before the filing of the petition for adoption. The probate judge by final decree on October 31, 1957, approved the adoption. The natural parents have appealed. The evidence is reported.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-11\">The facts are stated upon the basis of the judge\u2019s findings of material facts which are plainly justified by the evidence. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"637\">*637</page-number>The unmarried mother of the child, discovering that she was pregnant, went with the father of the child, in September, 1955, to consult a doctor. The doctor urged marriage. The father, a student then receiving G. I. aid of $110 a month, said that \u201cunder no circumstances\u201d could he \u201cpossibly get married.\u201d The mother said she did not want to use the baby to force marriage then or in the future. She declined to deal with the usual State agencies and asked that the \u201cdoctor . . . refer the baby to some private family.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b675-5\">The doctor discovered that the petitioners, married for eight years and childless, were going to Sicily in the hope of finding a child there to adopt. The doctor discussed this with the child\u2019s mother while she was still in the hospital following the child\u2019s birth. The petitioners in the meantime had gone to Europe, but returned by air at once on receiving word that the child was available. On her discharge from the hospital, the mother and \u201cthe child\u2019s father left the new born baby at the home of the male petitioner\u2019s brother.\u201d (See comment, <em>infra, </em>on this finding.) The confinement expenses of the mother were paid by the petitioners. The \u201cchild\u2019s mother assented to the\u201d adoption petition after being told that the paper she was signing was \u201cthe adoption paper,\u201d although the attorney did not want her to \u201csee the names of the adopting parents.\u201d See <em>Erickson </em>v. <em>Raspperry, </em>320 Mass. 333, 334.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-6\">The natural father and mother now five in a somewhat unsatisfactory apartment in a congested area. The father testified that he would plan to live for a time with his parents in a suburb of Boston, if the adoption should be in fact refused and if they should gain custody of the child. The father\u2019s income, while he remains a student and when first starting work, will be small compared to that of the petitioners.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-7\">The petitioners five in Winthrop and have adequate income and suitable facilities to enable them to give the child good care. Besides caring for the child, the female petitioner \u201ckeeps house for her husband, and a fourteen months old baby boy placed [there] ... by the Catholic Charitable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number>Bureau.\u201d They are happily married, \u201cregular church attendants and highly respected in their community.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b676-5\">The department\u2019s psychologist examined the child in the petitioners\u2019 house. She stated that the female petitioner \u201cis to be commended for her loving and wise care of . . . [the child] when she had two babies to care for at one time,\u201d that the child \u201cshows by his splendid development and contentment that he is secure in this home,\u201d and that the male petitioner \u201cis . . . devoted to the children.\u201d Counsel for the natural parents conceded that he did not \u201cknow anything ill or bad about the\u201d petitioners. There was testimony of a psychiatrist from the Children\u2019s Medical Center that \u201cany child who has developed very nicely in a family in which he has lived for nineteen months suffers a severe set back to be changed in [sic] any other situation.\u201d The judge concluded \u201cthat it is for the best interest of this little boy to be the adopted son of the petitioners, not merely for security but also for the moulding of character.\u201d Relevant statutes governing adoption are set out in part in the margin.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Various questions are raised by these provisions and by G. L. c. 190, \u00a7 7 (as amended through St. 1943, c. 72, \u00a7 1), which provides that an \u201cillegitimate child whose parents have intermarried and whose father has acknowledged him as his child . . . shall be deemed legiti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>mate and shall be entitled to take the name of his parents to the same extent as if born in lawful wedlock.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b677-5\">1. The failure of the department of public welfare (see footnote 2, <em>swpra) </em>to consent to the petition presents no obstacle to the adoption. Under G. L. c. 210, \u00a7 2A (E), as amended (see footnote 2, <em>supra), </em>an appeal to the Probate Court lies from the department\u2019s action. Nothing in the statute requires that such appeal be taken by any formal document. The trial judge, by an express reference to St. 1957, c. 184, reasonably treated the hearing on the merits of the adoption petition as such an appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-6\">2. The judge\u2019s finding that the child\u2019s mother herself, accompanied by the child\u2019s father, \u201cleft the new born baby at the home of the male petitioner\u2019s brother\u201d in a minor respect differs from the evidence, for the mother testified that she left the child at the doctor\u2019s office. This inadvertence is immaterial, for the judge would have been amply justified in finding that the doctor was the mother\u2019s agent to transfer the child to the petitioners. As the placement of the child for adoption thus was by both natural parents, the provisions of G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 6, as amended (see footnote 2, <em>supra), </em>were satisfied.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-7\">3. The probate judge\u2019s conclusion, that the adoption was for the best interests of the child, was justified. We must consider, however, an issue of law which does not appear to have been argued to the probate judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-8\">An illegitimate child acknowledged by the father becomes legitimate under G. L. c. 190, \u00a7 7, as amended, upon the intermarriage of the natural parents at least \u201cfrom and after the time when the intermarriage becomes valid under the law.\u201d <em>Hopkins </em>v. <em>Hopkins, </em>287 Mass. 542, 550. See <em>Loring </em>v. <em>Thorndike, 5 </em>Allen, 257, <em>263; Monson </em>v. <em>Palmer, </em>8 Allen, 551, 556; <em>Houghton </em>v. <em>Dickinson, </em>196 Mass. 389, 391. Cf. <em>Lopes </em>v. <em>Downey, </em>334 Mass. 161, 163. The father acknowledged this child on various occasions, notably by a petition for custody of the child filed on August 16, 1957. Because the child became legitimate about eleven months before the final decree, we must decide whether that decree could be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>entered without the father\u2019s written consent, in view of G. L. c. 210, \u00a7 2, as amended (see footnote 2, <em>supra). </em>If the persons whose consent to the decree of adoption is required under \u00a7 2 are to be determined at the date of the decree, the consent of the natural father at that time may have become necessary. If the persons who must consent to the decree are to be determined at the date of the petition or upon the return of an order of notice under c. 210, \u00a7 4,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> then the result may be different. This question was first considered in this court for its possible bearing upon the Probate Court\u2019s jurisdiction to enter the decree. See <em>Foster </em>v. <em>Everett, </em>334 Mass. 14, 16; <em>Witzgall </em>v. <em>Witzgall, </em>334 Mass. 365, 368.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-5\">Sections 3, 3A, 4, and 5 of c. 210 provide some exceptions from the requirements of such consent laid down in \u00a7 2. Sections 3 (as amended through St. 1955, c. 89) and 3A (inserted by St. 1953, c. 593, \u00a7 1) do not directly cover the present situation, although \u00a7 3 does indicate that the date of the petition, in certain cases at least, determines the persons to whom notice is required under \u00a7 4 and whose consent is necessary except as provided in \u00a7 5 (see e.g. the case of a father in prison or who has deserted his child, whose conduct or status as related to the date of the petition determines whether his consent to adoption is required). See also the brief discussion of the effect of certain events subsequent to the petition in <em>Barden </em>v. <em>Flannery, </em>256 Mass. 140, 141-142. The successive amendments<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> of \u00a7 3, although they show <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"641\">*641</page-number>some recent relaxation of the legislative requirements of consents to adoptions by natural parents, also do not directly deal with the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-5\">It may be argued that G. L. c. 190, \u00a7 7, has no necessary relation to adoption proceedings because it appears in a chapter of the General Laws relating to descent and distribution and because the section is usually thought of only in that connection. See e.g. 38 B. U. L. Rev. 299, 311-312. Section 7, however, has been applied in cases not involving the devolution of property. See <em>Monson </em>v. <em>Palmer, </em>8 Allen, 551, 556, in which Hoar, J. (in considering whether children, deemed to be legitimate for other purposes, take the settlement of the father) said of a predecessor of \u00a7 7, \u201cIts terms are as broad and general as the language affords. And we do not think there is such evidence that the intention of the Legislature was to confine their application to the single subject of the descent of property, as will authorize this court to interpret it in any narrower sense by implication, than that which the import of the language used naturally suggests.\u201d See also another legislative application of the broad policy behind \u00a7 7 in G. L. c. 46, \u00a7 13 (as amended through St. 1956, c. 342), relating in part to amendment of birth records of legitimatized children. There has been brought to our attention no indication whatsoever that the Legislature in framing the adoption provisions found in c. 210 has ever given any thought to the provisions of c. 190, \u00a7 7. We recognize, however, that \u00a7 7 carries out a broad legislative policy of relieving an illegitimate child, whose parents subsequently marry and whose father acknowledges him, from all the disabilities of birth out of wedlock and of placing the child on a parity with legitimate children for all purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-6\">No prior Massachusetts case appears to decide the precise question here presented. Cf. <em>Erickson </em>v. <em>Raspperry, </em>320 Mass. 333, 334. In other States, however, the question has been considered under statutes which vary somewhat from ours. See Annotation, 51 A. L. R. 2d 497, 503-509. Some jurisdictions hold that the consent of the natural father to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number>adoption is required where there has been legitimization of a child by the marriage of his natural parents and the acknowledgment of the child by the father.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Decisions in other jurisdictions are consistent with the view that legitimization by intermarriage subsequent to the giving of consent to adoption by a mother, then unmarried, does not retroactively \u25a0 operate to make the father\u2019s consent necessary.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b680-4\">In <em>Wyness </em>v. <em>Crowley, </em>292 Mass. 461, 463-464, this court held that the consent of the natural mother, given before the filing of a petition under c. 210, \u00a7 2, could not be withdrawn after the filing of the petition without the consent of the probate judge. See <em>Kalika </em>v. <em>Munro, </em>323 Mass. 542, 543; Newhall, Settlement of Estates (4th ed.) \u00a7 24, pp. 74-75. See also <em>Harper </em>v. <em>Harper, </em>329 Mass. 85, 88-89. The effect of the <em>Wyness </em>case was thus to treat the date of the petition, with the prior consent of the natural mother upon it, as determining her consent, unless in the discretion of the court she was permitted to withdraw her consent. See <em>Erickson </em>v. <em>Raspperry, </em>320 Mass. 333, 335; <em>Ellis </em>v. <em>McCoy, </em>332 Mass. 254, 258.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-5\">In the present case, the natural father participated in placing the child for adoption. This probably does not impose an absolute estoppel upon him to oppose the adoption for the probate judge in his discretion could certainly permit him to oppose an adoption as not in the best interest of the child. Cf. <em>Ellis </em>v. <em>McCoy, </em>332 Mass. 254, 259. At the time the mother\u2019s consent was given she alone had authority to speak for the natural parents under c. 210, \u00a7 2, and did so. The father\u2019s consent then was not necessary. See <em>Gibson, appellant, </em>154 Mass. 378, 381-382; Annotation, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number>24 A. L. R. 416, 428. Cf. <em>Chambers\u2019s Case, </em>221 Mass. 178, 179-180; <em>Plymouth </em>v. <em>Hey, </em>285 Mass. 357, 359. The natural father\u2019s participation in the placement ought fairly to put him on no better basis, as of right, than the natural mother, who would not be allowed to withdraw her earlier consent except with the permission of the Probate Court. Her consent, conclusive when given, should be treated as binding on him as the other natural parent. Permission to withdraw that consent should be given by the probate judge only when the best interests of the child so dictate.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-4\">We give great weight to the considerations mentioned in the testimony (quoted above) of the psychiatrist from the Children\u2019s Medical Center. See also <em>Adoption of Morrison, </em>260 Wis. 50, 63-65, which discusses this problem. When a child is placed by its parent for adoption in a good family the inevitable consequence will be that firm bonds of affection and confidence will rapidly arise on both sides. The damage to the child, who cannot understand what is happening, from breaking these bonds is something which even competent psychiatrists may be unable to predict. In the absence of compelling statutory command, such a breach should not be permitted lightly at the request of either of the natural parents who had their chance to take care of the child themselves and who themselves have created the unfortunate situation. The interests of the natural parents in such a case must be completely subordinated to the paramount interest of the child. Weight must also be given to the general tendency in recent amendments (see footnote 4, <em>supra) </em>of the adoption statutes to permit a constantly greater area of discretion to the Probate Court with respect to approving adoptions which will serve the best interests of the child. In the absence of any indication that the Legislature has ever had G. L. c. 190, \u00a7 7, specifically in mind when dealing with c. 210, \u00a7 2,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> we hold that the consent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number>of a father who was not a lawful parent at the child\u2019s birth or at the time when there is a default under c. 210, \u00a7\u00a7 4 and 5, is not required by \u00a7 2, as a condition precedent to adoption.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-5\">We recognize that,- in other connections, we have given weight to the interest of natural parents. <em>Richards </em>v. <em>Forrest, </em>278 Mass. 547, 556. <em>Gordon </em>v. <em>Gordon, </em>317 Mass. 471, 474-477. <em>Stinson </em>v. <em>Meegan, </em>318 Mass. 459, 465-466.
