The prayers are for a temporary injunction pending a hearing, for a permanent injunction restraining \u201csuch registration and practice,\u201d and for further relief. The judge found that the allegations of the bill are true. On November 25, 1957, an order was entered for a decree permanently restraining the registration of the daughters under the name of Ruegg in the three specified schools \u201cunless and until the surname of \u2018Ruegg\u2019 be lawfully bestowed and changed thereto from the present lawful surname of \u2018Margolis.\u2019\u201d <em>Mark </em>v. <em>Kahn, </em>333 Mass. 517.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-5\">On February 6, 1958, the plaintiff moved to amend his bill by adding two new prayers for relief: a fourth, that the children be entered in the present schools under the name of Margolis, and a fifth, that the defendant be permanently enjoined from causing any of the children to be known by any other surname than Margolis or from so representing them. The plaintiff also moved that the order of November 25, 1957, be amended to grant the relief asked in the motion to amend the bill. After a hearing, at which the plaintiff presented certain requests for rulings, the judge on February 28, 1958, denied the motions without acting on the requests, which must be treated as denied. <em>Kravetz </em>v. <em>Lipofsky, </em>294 Mass. 80, 84. <em>Bankoff </em>v. <em>Coleman Bros. Inc. </em>302 Mass. 122, 123. <em>Ryerson </em>v. <em>Fall River Philanthropic Burial Soc. </em>315 Mass. 244, 246.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-6\">Without pausing to consider procedural questions which are raised on the record to date, it is apparent that on the judge\u2019s finding, that the adoption of false surnames is not in the best interests of the children, this litigation should be brought to an end. The judge appears to have ruled in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>denying a request that he had no power to allow an amendment to the bill. This was incorrect. <em>Day </em>v. <em>Mills, </em>213 Mass. 585, 587. In any event, we have that power. G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 231, \u00a7 125. We do now allow the plaintiff\u2019s motion to amend by adding prayers 4 and 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-5\">The final decree is to be modified by also enjoining the defendant in accordance with prayers 4 and 5, and, as so modified, it is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
