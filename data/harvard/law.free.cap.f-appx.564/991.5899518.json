After review of the record and Wilmington Trust\u2019s brief, we affirm.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1057-6\">Ms. Malone has two mortgage liens on her house. The first has an outstanding balance that exceeds the house\u2019s current value, while the second, at issue in this case and held by Wilmington Trust, is junior to the first lien. Wilmington Trust\u2019s lien is considered to be wholly \u201cunderwater\u201d in that the debt secured by the first lien exceeds the current value of the house. Accordingly, Ms. Malone moved to have Wilmington Trust\u2019s junior lien extinguished under \u00a7 506(d) of the Bankruptcy Code. <em>See </em>11 U.S.C. \u00a7 506(d). Notwithstanding certain stated reservations, the bankruptcy court granted Ms. Malone\u2019s motion, concluding that binding circuit precedent holds that \u00a7 506(d) authorizes a Chapter 7 debtor to \u201cstrip off,\u201d <em>ie. </em>remove in its entirety, a junior lien where the amount of debt securing the senior lien exceeds the value of the house. <em>See McNeal v. GMAC Mortgage, LLC (In re McNeal), </em>735 F.3d 1263, 1266 (11th Cir.2012); <em>Folendore v. SBA (In re Folendore), </em>862 F.2d 1537, 1539 (11th Cir.1989). The bankruptcy court granted the parties\u2019 joint motion to certify its order for direct appeal under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(d)(2)(A) and Federal Rule of Bankruptcy Procedure 8001(f).</p>\n<p id=\"b1057-7\">Wilmington Trust argues that the Supreme Court\u2019s intervening opinion in <em>Dewsnup v. Timm, </em>502 U.S. 410, 112 S.Ct. 773, 116 L.Ed.2d 903 (1992), abrogated our construction of \u00a7 506(d) as set forth in <em>Folendore, </em>and that we therefore should re-visit this issue. As Wilmington Trust also acknowledges, however, we recently rejected that very argument in <em>McNeal, </em>concluding that <em>Dewsnup </em>was not clearly on point because it disallowed only a \u201cstrip down\u201d of a partially secured mortgage lien, rather than a \u201cstrip off\u2019 of a wholly unsecured mortgage lien, and thus did not abrogate <em>Folendore. See McNeal, </em>735 F.3d at 1265-66.</p>\n<p id=\"b1057-11\">Because we are bound to follow our prior published decisions in <em>Folendore </em>and <em>McNeal, </em>we affirm the bankruptcy court\u2019s decision voiding Wilmington Trust\u2019s lien on Ms. Malone\u2019s house.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1057-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1057-8\">. Ms. Malone filed no answer brief in this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1057-9\">. By separate order, Wilmington Trust\u2019s petition for initial hearing en banc has been denied. Wilmington Trust remains free, of course, to seek rehearing en banc of this panel\u2019s decision.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
