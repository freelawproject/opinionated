After a careful review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-12\">After Godinez-Del Toro\u2019s convictions at trial, the probation officer prepared a pre-sentence investigation report (PSI) calculating his base offense level at 38, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c)(l). Due to the application of a two-level role enhancement under \u00a7 3B 1.1(c), his total offense level became 40. Because Godinez-Del Toro\u2019s criminal history category was I, his applicable guideline range was 292 to 365 months\u2019 imprisonment. He was subject to a mandatory-minimum ten year sentence and a statutory maximum of life on each count. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A)(viii). The district court adopted the PSI\u2019s calculations, but ultimately sentenced Godinez-Del Toro to a low-end guideline sentence of 292 months. This is his appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-14\">We review the reasonableness of a sentence under a deferential abuse of discretion standard, <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 41, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007), and the party challenging the sentence bears the burden of establishing that it is unreasonable, <em>United States v. Gonzalez, </em>550 F.3d 1319, 1324 (11th Cir.2008). To evaluate procedural reasonableness, we consider, among other things, whether the district court failed to consider the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors or failed to adequately explain the chosen sentence. <em>United States v. Livesay, </em>525 F.3d 1081, 1091 (11th Cir.2008). \u201cIn consideration of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, the district court does not need to discuss or state each factor explicitly. An acknowledgment the district court has considered the defendant\u2019s arguments and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors will suffice.\u201d <em>Gonzalez, </em>550 F.3d at 1324 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b564-15\">The substantive reasonableness of a sentence is examined in light of the totality of the circumstances and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. 586. Under \u00a7 3553(a), the district court must impose a sentence that is sufficient, but not greater than necessary, to reflect the seriousness of the offense, promote respect for the law, provide just punishment for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>the offense, deter criminal conduct, and protect the public from future crimes of the defendant. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2). The court must also consider, among other factors, the nature and circumstances of the offense, the history and characteristics of the defendant, and the applicable guideline range. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 3553(a). We will not vacate a sentence as substantively unreasonable unless \u201cleft with the definite and firm conviction that the district court committed a clear error of judgment in weighing the \u00a7 3553(a) factors by arriving at a sentence that lies outside the range of reasonable sentences dictated by the facts of the case.\u201d <em>United States v. Irey, </em>612 F.3d 1160, 1190 (11th Cir.2010) <em>(en banc).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b565-5\">On appeal, Godinez-Del Toro contends that any sentence above the ten-year mandatory minimum he faced on each count would be unreasonable and greater than necessary to accomplish the goals of sentencing, and that the district court failed to adequately explain its reasons for imposing his specific sentence. In support of his claims of error, Godinez-Del Toro cites his lack of criminal history; the increased costs to the government of incarcerating him beyond the ten-year mandatory minimum; and his minor role in the offense conduct as a \u201cmiddle man errand runner.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b565-6\">Based on the record, we cannot say that the district court abused its discretion. First, Godinez-Del Toro\u2019s sentence is procedurally reasonable because the district court explained that it had considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, correctly calculated the applicable guideline range, and acknowledged the advisory nature of the Guidelines. Notably, the court was not required to specifically state why it opted not to deviate from the guideline range down to the statutory minimum.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-7\">The sentence is also substantively reasonable. Godinez-Del Toro\u2019s total 292-month sentence was at the low-end of his guideline range of 292 to 365 months\u2019 imprisonment. <em>See Gonzalez, </em>550 F.3d at 1324 (\u201cWe ordinarily expect a sentence within the Guidelines range to be reasonable\u201d). His sentence is also well below the statutory maximum of life imprisonment, which itself is indicative of a reasonable sentence. <em>See id. </em>Although Godinez-Del Toro highlights his lack of a criminal background and the fact that he did not use any weapons during the offense conduct as mitigating circumstances, these factors were already accounted for in the district court\u2019s calculation of his advisory guideline range. As such, we are far from convinced that Godinez-Del Toro\u2019s low-end sentence of 292 months\u2019 imprisonment is substantively unreasonable particularly in light of the nature and circumstances of the offense, including the amount of drugs that were seized and his relatively significant role as \u201cmoney man\u201d in the drug organization. Accordingly, we affirm Godinez-Del Toro\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
