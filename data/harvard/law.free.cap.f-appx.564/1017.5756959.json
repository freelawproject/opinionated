After review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1046-15\">For the first time on appeal, Burton argues that the district court erred in treating his three prior felony drug convictions under Florida Statutes \u00a7 893.13(l)(a) as \u201ccontrolled substance offenses\u201d under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(2).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Section 893.13(l)(a) makes it unlawful \u201cto sell, manufacture, or deliver, or possess with intent to sell, manufacture, or deliver, a controlled substance.\u201d Fla. Stat. \u00a7 893.13(l)(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b1046-16\">Because Burton did not dispute in the district court that his prior Florida convictions qualified as controlled substance offenses, our review is limited to plain error. <em>See United States v. Castro, </em>455 F.3d 1249, 1251 (11th Cir.2006). For an error to be plain, it must be clear under current law. <em>Id. </em>at 1253. \u201cWhen the explicit language of a statute or rule does not specifically resolve an issue, there can be no plain error where there is no precedent from the Supreme Court or this Court directly resolving it.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1046-17\">Under \u00a7 2K2.1, the defendant\u2019s offense level increases to 24 if he has two prior felony convictions for either a crime of violence or a \u201ccontrolled substance offense.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(2). The term \u201ccontrolled substance offense\u201d as used in \u00a7 2K2.1, means:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1046-18\">an offense under federal <em>or state </em>law, punishable by imprisonment for a term <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1019\">*1019</page-number>exceeding one year, that prohibits <em>the manufacture, import, export, distribution, or dispensing of a controlled substance </em>(or a counterfeit substance) or the possession of a controlled substance (or a counterfeit substance) with intent to manufacture, import, export, distribute, or dispense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1047-4\">U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2(b) (emphasis added); <em>see also </em>2K2.1(a)(2) cmt. n. 1 (providing that \u00a7 4B1.2(b)\u2019s definition of \u201ccontrolled substance offense\u201d applies to offense level enhancements under \u00a7 2K2.1).</p>\n<p id=\"b1047-5\">A violation of Florida Statutes \u00a7 893.13(l)(a) falls squarely within U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2(b)\u2019s definition of a \u201ccontrolled substance offense.\u201d As a violation of Florida criminal law, it is an \u201coffense under federal or state law.\u201d <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2(b). Given that a \u00a7 893.13(a)(1) cocaine offense is a second degree felony that carries a fifteen-year maximum prison term and a \u00a7 893.13(a)(1) cannabis offense is a third degree felony that carries a five-year maximum prison term, these \u00a7 893(a)(1) offenses meet U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2(b)\u2019s requirement that the state offense be punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year. <em>See </em>Fla. Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 893.13(l)(a)(l)-(2); 893.03(2)(a); 775.082(3)(c)-(d). And, by making it unlawful \u201cto sell, manufacture, or deliver, or possess with intent to sell, manufacture, or deliver\u201d cannabis and cocaine, Florida Statutes \u00a7 893.13(a)(1) clearly \u201cprohibits the manufacture, import, export, distribution, or dispensing of a controlled substance ... or the possession of a controlled substance ... with intent to manufacture, import, export, distribute, or dispense,\u201d as defined in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2(b). The district court\u2019s treatment of Beasley\u2019s convictions was not erroneous, much less plain error, under the language of \u00a7 4B1.2(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b1047-8\">Burton argues that a \u00a7 893.13(a)(1) violation can never be a controlled substance offense in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2(b) because only knowledge of the presence of the substance, but not its illicit nature, is an element of a \u00a7 893.13(l)(a) offense. <em>See State v. Adkins, </em>96 So.3d 412, 415-16, 423 (Fla.2012); <em>see also Shelton v. Sec\u2019y, Dep\u2019t of Corrs., </em>691 F.3d 1348, 1350-51 (11th Cir.2012), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 133 S.Ct. 1856, 185 L.Ed.2d 822 (2013) (explaining that the Florida legislature\u2019s 2002 amendment to \u00a7 893.13(1)(a) \u201cdid not completely eliminate <em>mens rea </em>from Florida drug crimes\u201d; it converted one aspect of <em>mens rea </em>[the illicit nature knowledge] from an element of the crime into an affirmative defense). However, the plain language of \u00a7 4B1.2(b) does not require knowledge of the substance\u2019s illicit nature for an offense to be a controlled substance offense. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2(b) (requiring only that the state law \u201cprohibits the manufacture, import, export, distribution, or dispensing of a controlled substance\u201d). Thus, Burton cannot show plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b1047-11\">Burton relies on <em>Donawa v. United States Attorney General, </em>735 F.3d 1275 (11th Cir.2013), but <em>Donawa </em>has no application here. <em>Donawa </em>involved whether an alien\u2019s conviction under Florida Statutes \u00a7 893.13(1)(a) qualified as an \u201caggravated felony\u201d under the Immigration and Nationality Act, which defines the term to include drug trafficking offenses listed in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(2). <em>Donawa, </em>735 F.3d at 1280. Burton\u2019s reliance on <em>Descamps v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 133 S.Ct. 2276, 186 L.Ed.2d 438 (2013), is similarly misplaced. <em>Descamps </em>concluded that a defendant\u2019s prior California burglary conviction did not qualify as a \u201cviolent felony\u201d under the Armed Career Criminal Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e). <em>Descamps, </em>133 S.Ct. at 2285-86. Given that <em>Descamps </em>and <em>Dona-wa </em>address other federal statutes and do <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1020\">*1020</page-number>not address whether an offense under Florida Statutes \u00a7 893.13(l)(a) is a controlled substance offense under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2(b), their holdings cannot establish plain error in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1048-4\">For these reasons, Burton has not shown plain error. <em>See Castro, </em>455 F.3d at 1253. Accordingly, we affirm Burton\u2019s 70-month sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1048-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1046-12\">. Burton's presentence investigation report (PSI) identified two of the felony drug convictions as \u201cCannabis, Sell, Manufacture, Deliver, Possession with Intent,\u201d and the third felony drug conviction as \"Cocaine Sell, Manufacture, Deliver, Possession with Intent.\u201d The PSI did not identify the statute underlying these convictions, but the parties agree that Burton\u2019s drug convictions were for violating Florida Statutes \u00a7 893.13(l)(a).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
