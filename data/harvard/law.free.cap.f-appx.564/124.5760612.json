He contends his within-Guidelines sentence is substantively unreasonable because it is greater than necessary to satisfy the sentencing goals of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). Along that line, he contends: the sentence is too severe because his offense was, at most, an international trespass; his reason for reentry, his daughter\u2019s request that he return to help care for his other children, mitigates his offense and outweighs his criminal history; and, there are additional mitigating facts \u2014 he has lived in the United States for much of his adult life and he suffers from alcoholism and gout.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-19\">Although <em>post-Booker, </em>the Sentencing Guidelines are advisory only, and a properly preserved objection to an ultimate sentence is reviewed for reasonableness under an abuse-of-discretion standard, the district court must still properly calculate the Guidelines-sentencing range for use in deciding on the sentence to impose. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). In that respect, for issues preserved in district court, its application of the Guidelines is reviewed <em>de novo; </em>its factual findings, only for clear error. <em>E.g., United States v. Cisneros-Gutierrez, </em>517 F.3d 751, 764 (5th Cir.2008). Persona does not claim procedural error. As noted, he claims only that his sentence is substantively unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-20\">\u201cA discretionary sentence imposed within a properly calculated guidelines range is presumptively reasonable.\u201d <em>United States v. Campos-Maldonado, </em>531 F.3d 337, 338 (5th Cir.2008) (citations omitted). Although Persona contends a sentence imposed under the illegal-reentry Guideline should not be accorded that presumption because it is not empirically based, he concedes this contention is foreclosed by this court\u2019s precedent; he raises it only to preserve the issue for possible further review. <em>See United States v. Duarte, </em>569 F.3d 528, 529-30 (5th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b153-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>The record reflects the district court had an adequate basis for the sentence imposed. It considered the presentence investigation report, Persona\u2019s allocution, his extensive criminal history, and the purposes of sentencing as expressed in \u00a7 3553(a). The court acknowledged Persona\u2019s reasons for return, but explained it could not overlook Persona\u2019s lengthy criminal history. Further, the court noted it relied on Persona\u2019s personal history and characteristics, as well as the nature and circumstances of his offense, in setting the sentence. We do not require a \u201crobotic\u201d recitation of each factor under \u00a7 3553(a). <em>United States v. Smith, </em>440 F.3d 704, 707 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b153-5\">This court has rejected repeatedly the contention that the Guidelines overstate the seriousness of illegal reentry because, according to Persona, it is simply an international trespass offense. <em>E.g., United States v. Juarez-Duarte, </em>513 F.3d 204, 212 (5th Cir.2008). Persona has not shown the court failed to consider a significant factor, gave significant weight to an irrelevant factor, or made a clear error of judgment in balancing the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Cooks, </em>589 F.3d 173, 186 (5th Cir.2009). Rather, he disagrees with its weighing of those factors and asks this court to reevaluate the decision. Given the deference due to a district court\u2019s assessment of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and its sentencing decision, Persona has not shown his sentence is substantively unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b152-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
