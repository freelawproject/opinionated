Allen argues for relief from his convictions on the ground that the district court erred when it refused to accept his plea of guilty to the distribution offense and later when it denied his motion for a judgment of acquittal on the charge of conspiring to distribute methamphetamine. Allen also challenges the enhancement of his sentence for obstruction of justice and the denial of relief under the safety valve. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-5\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b580-6\">Allen and his coconspirators were charged, in a six-count indictment, for crimes related to their conspiracy to distribute methamphetamine. Allen was indicted for two crimes: conspiring to distribute and possess with intent to distribute 50 grams or more of methamphetamine between January 24, 2011, and August 19, 2011, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 \u00a7 841(a)(1), 841(b)(1)(A), 846, and distributing five grams or more of methamphetamine on August 19, 2011, <em>id. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1), (b)(1)(B). Allen initially pleaded not guilty to the charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-8\">Allen entered a written agreement to plead guilty to distributing methamphetamine in exchange for the dismissal of his charge for conspiracy and for recommendations by the government to reduce his offense level for his acceptance of responsibility and to impose a sentence at the low end of the advisory guidelines range. The factual basis stated that Allen agreed to sell a confidential informant $1,600 of methamphetamine; the informant delivered the cash to Allen at his tile shop; Allen handed the money to Andres Hernandez, who left the shop in Allen\u2019s truck to obtain the methamphetamine; the informant also left Allen\u2019s shop and later returned after Allen notified him that the drugs had been delivered; the informant collected the methamphetamine, which was lying on the floor of the shop wrapped inside a towel; and Allen also sold the informant half of a pound of marijuana for $650, which was wrapped in a towel. When tested, the methamphetamine weighed 22.2 grams.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-10\">At the change of plea hearing, Allen tendered a plea of guilty and stated that he had not been coerced to change his plea to guilty. But when asked if he was tendering his plea of guilty voluntarily, Allen stated that his father had received a telephone call in which the caller threatened to harm Allen\u2019s family if he did not plead guilty.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b580-11\">THE COURT: Other than the terms of the plea agreement we have just briefly discussed, has anybody promised you anything or given you any other assurance of any kind in an effort to induce you to enter this plea of guilty?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b580-12\">THE DEFENDANT: No, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b580-13\">THE COURT: Has anyone attempted in any way to force you to plead guilty in this case?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b580-14\">THE DEFENDANT: No, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b580-15\">THE COURT: Are you pleading guilty voluntarily and of your own personal decision to do so?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b580-16\">THE DEFENDANT: Well, can I say something, Your Honor? THE COURT: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b580-17\">THE DEFENDANT: My and my dad\u2019s name are the same. And I was \u2014 I was kind of \u2014 somebody called my dad and threatened if I didn\u2019t plead into it, you <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>know, or that they were going to harm my family. And they called his number thinking that was me, because I\u2019m a junior and it\u2019s not listed in the phone book as a junior. So, but I understand, yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-5\">THE COURT: Well, are you pleading guilty because somebody made a threat on your life, or your father\u2019s, or your family\u2019s, or are you pleading guilty because you are, in fact, guilty?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-6\">THE DEFENDANT: It was today when they called.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-7\">THE COURT: No. That\u2019s not my question.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-8\">Are you pleading guilty because you are, in fact, guilty?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-9\">THE DEFENDANT: No, sir. I\u2019m guilty. I\u2019m guilty, sir, you \u2014 but, you know, I\u2019m guilty, yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b581-10\">When asked to state a factual basis for his plea, Allen stated that he participated in the drug transaction because he worked as a confidential informant for the Etowah County Drug Task Force. Allen stated that he had worked for the task force for years and that he was trying to gain the confidence of drug dealers and infiltrate a drug organization to \u201cwork off\u2019 criminal charges incurred by his son.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-11\">THE DEFENDANT: I was working \u2014 I sold narcotics \u2014 I worked for Etowah County for seven years. I have worked for Etowah County as a C.I.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-12\">THE COURT: C.I.?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-13\">THE DEFENDANT: Yes, sir. And to the point \u2014 to the point I have listed things I have done for them that I was under the influence of whatever I had to do to get to the Avilas is what I was asked to do.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-14\">And I got \u2014 I was also in a process, these other guys here with me, I have cases on them that I \u2014 I was actually trying to work something off for my son. My son was in some trouble. And I got involved in it and was trying to help him in on it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-16\">And when the physical evidence come back against my son, I couldn\u2019t \u2014 they said it wouldn\u2019t count. So all this that I have done for \u2014 for my son, the trafficking cases with these guys here that are listed on this, they don\u2019t count.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-17\">So I was still trying to get to the Avilas through Andres and the other Mexican trying to bring down an organization that Etowah County\u2019s been trying to get for the past 10 or 15 years, I guess, maybe longer. And I got caught up in it too much and \u2014 and was trying to do whatever I had to do, do whatever I had to do to get involved in it. And I got caught selling also.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-18\">THE COURT: Well\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-19\">THE DEFENDANT: Without \u2014 without the \u2014 then- authorization, but was under the influence that I was told specially to do what I had to do, we went to Avilas.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-20\">THE COURT: So did you think you were working for the drug task force, or were you doing it for your own profit?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A-h\">THE DEFENDANT: There was no profit involved, sir. I was trying to further more \u2014 my influence of getting involved with them, you know. They come to my shop, like a few days before that, five of them did, with Andres. Come to my shop. And Steve Guthrie knows about that the \u2014 of Etowah\u2014 Steve Guthrie and [sic] narcotic agent that I have been working for, for the past five years and brought down big cases for them all over Georgia, Alabama, you know. I was in the other states, too, doing work for them.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-21\">But he knew about them coming to the shop, meeting with me. And this was exact words, the organization.... <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>They were in Roebuck, these guys were. And they were in an organization.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b582-4\">The district court interrupted Allen and asked the prosecutor why Allen was being charged for distributing methamphetamine. The prosecutor acknowledged that Allen had served extensively as an informant before the drug transaction, but the prosecutor argued that Allen did not conduct the transaction on behalf of the government. Allen\u2019s attorney interjected that the government had video and audio recordings of the transaction.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b582-5\">THE COURT: Why are we here, Ms. Hodge?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b582-6\">MS. HODGE: It\u2019s the Government\u2019s position \u2014 we agree in part with what Mr. Allen says.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b582-7\">There was a period of time where he was working with the Etowah County Drug Task Force Unit extensively in the past for credit for things on state-related cases, things related to his son, things of that nature. He was, in fact, working to help make some of the deals that are part of this indictment. And then he fell off the wagon, so to speak.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b582-8\">There was a period of time in between. ... And the last buy that we have in which he was involved working for law enforcement was April 6th of 2011.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b582-9\">So it\u2019s the Government\u2019s position there was a period of approximately four months when he was not in contact with law enforcement where he was not working at their behest. He was not conducting otherwise illegal activity under the authority of law enforcement, which is how we were able to make this buy from him on August the 19th. That was not part of any authorized activity that he was supposed to be doing as a confidential informant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b582-10\">THE COURT: So you sent a C.I., a C.I. informant in to make a buy on this date from Mr. Hernandez and Mr. Allen?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b582-11\">MS. HODGE: Yes, Your Honor. And that was based on information that they were hearing \u2014 that law enforcement was hearing about Mr. Allen going off on his own ventures.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b582-12\">MR. BROOME: I might also add, there is a video and audio of that C.I. buying from Mr. Allen on August the 19th.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b582-13\">The district court questioned Allen about his conduct. Allen acknowledged that he was not instructed by the task force to sell the methamphetamine, but he insisted that he made the sale on behalf of the task force.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b582-14\">THE COURT: Mr. Allen, did you hear and understand what Ms. Laura Hodge the assisting supervisor said?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b582-15\">THE DEFENDANT: Yes, sir. THE COURT: Is she correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b582-16\">THE DEFENDANT: Yes, sir, she is. But I was under the influence \u2014 you know\u2014</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b582-17\">The district court refused to accept Allen\u2019s change of plea to guilty. Allen and his attorney appeared prepared to proceed to trial,' but the prosecutor requested a recess for Allen to confer with his attorney.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b582-18\">THE COURT: \u2014 I tell you what. I think we better try this case. And let Mr. Allen explain himself to the jury. And if they believe that he thought he was still under the influence of the Government, even though the Government sent a confidential informant in, then he can be found not guilty, but I am not going to take this plea. I wouldn\u2019t touch it with a ten foot pole.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b582-19\">MR. BROOME [Defense counsel]: Yes, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b582-20\">THE COURT: So you just get ready for trial, Mr. Allen. And that way you <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>won\u2019t have to worry about any personal\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b583-5\">THE DEFENDANT: Your Honor, I would, just speaking what I feel, you know, I\u2019m sorry.... You know, but I\u2014 you know, I do other work. I\u2019ve actually got ... other things, too, you know.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AfP\">THE COURT: Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b583-6\">MS. HODGE: Your Honor, if I may.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b583-7\">Could we have a few moments outside the presence of the Court to give Mr. Broome an opportunity to talk to his client and then to ask any questions of us that he might have in an effort to clarify this matter and resolve it today? THE COURT: I will give you some time.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b583-8\">When the hearing resumed, defense counsel announced that Allen wanted to plead guilty. The district court continued to express its reservations about accepting Allen\u2019s plea of guilty in the light of his protestations of innocence.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b583-9\">MR. BROOME: Judge, we would like to go forward with our change of plea, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b583-10\">THE COURT: Well, I\u2019m concerned about doing that, Mr. Broome.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b583-11\">As I understand what your client is saying, is that he ... was under the mental impression that he was doing what the Government wanted him to do when he sold 5 grams or more of methamphetamine to a confidential informant on the 19th day of August of 2011 in Etowah County.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b583-12\">MR. BROOME: Judge, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s what the facts show, and I don\u2019t really think that\u2019s what Mr. Allen meant to tell the Court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b583-13\">THE COURT: He stated it pretty clearly, as far as I heard.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b583-14\">MR. BROOME: Your Honor, he wouldn\u2019t have been \u2014 Judge, he can probably tell the Court must better than I can.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b583-16\">Allen acknowledged that the information included in the factual basis was accurate. Allen admitted that his truck was used to obtain the methamphetamine because \u201c[t]hey always used my vehicle\u201d; he knew the confidential informant, Sam Greenwood, because Greenwood had sold Allen illegal drugs in the past; and he instructed Greenwood to retrieve from the floor a towel containing the methamphetamine. But, when questioned by the district court, Allen maintained that he was acting for the task force.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b583-17\">THE COURT: Well, when you were doing all these things, did you think you were working on behalf of the Government, or was it for your own profit? MR. BROOME: You have got to tell the truth. That\u2019s all I can tell you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b583-18\">THE DEFENDANT: I felt like I was, but I guess I wasn\u2019t, sir. I felt like I was, though, in my heart.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b583-19\">The district court questioned Allen about the threatening telephone call. Allen\u2019s father stated that the caller said \u201cthey [would] get rid\u201d of Allen. Based on Allen\u2019s hesitation to admit his guilt and the threatening phone call, the district court refused to enter a plea of guilty.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b583-20\">THE COURT: And do you know who called your father\u2019s house today and threatened him?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b583-21\">THE DEFENDANT: No, sir. Other than being part of that organization.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AHk\">THE COURT: And what exactly did they say?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b583-22\">THE DEFENDANT: What exactly did they say, daddy?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b583-23\">MR. DAVID ALLEN, SR.: Said they was going to get rid of him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b583-24\">THE COURT: Well, I\u2019m not prepared to take this plea. And if there\u2019s a threat against Mr. Allen\u2019s life, best protection <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>that we can give him is to try his case. That way nobody will think that he is acting as a snitch, as an informant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b584-4\">MR. BROOME: Judge, I respect Your Honor\u2019s opinion on that, but it would come out during a trial that he was actually working \u2014 it would be more information than the public, as far as him working for the Etowah County Drug Task Force, if he went to trial. He would testify to that. I would ask the agents information about that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b584-5\">THE COURT: Well, if you want to waive venue, we could try it some place other than Gadsden and Etowah County.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Amg\">MR. BROOME: Then that is a\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b584-6\">THE COURT: That\u2019s up to you....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b584-7\">MR. BROOME: Thank you, Your Hon- or.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b584-8\">At trial, the government presented testimony and audio recordings establishing that Allen sold methamphetamine and marijuana to Greenwood, who was another informant for the county task force. Michael Martin, an agent of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, testified that Allen had worked as a confidential informant when making controlled purchases of methamphetamine between January and April 2011; Allen purchased the drugs from Hernandez, who the Bureau believed had connections to a drug trafficking organization run by the Avila family; and Allen always was equipped with a recording device and gave the drugs that he purchased to his supervising agents. After Martin learned that Allen had been selling drugs and had sold methamphetamine to Greenwood, Martin arranged for Greenwood to make a controlled purchase from Allen.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-9\">Martin and Greenwood testified about the drug transaction between Greenwood and Allen on August 19, 2011, and Greenwood identified the audio recording of the sale. Martin testified that, while Greenwood was waiting inside Allen\u2019s shop for Hernandez to return with the methamphetamine, Martin visited the shop to talk to Allen, but Allen did not mention that he was selling drugs to Greenwood. Greenwood admitted that he used methamphetamine and testified about his drug transaction with Allen; stated that Allen had demanded payment for methamphetamine he had given Greenwood one day earlier; and recalled a conversation in which Allen boasted that he was going to perform tile work in a federal agent\u2019s house and \u201csmoke some stuff in [the] bathroom.\u201d At the conclusion of Greenwood\u2019s testimony, Allen moved for a judgment of acquittal on the ground that there was insufficient evidence to prove that he had conspired with Hernandez to distribute methamphetamine, but the district court denied Allen\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-11\">Allen testified that he was acting on behalf of the task force when he sold methamphetamine to Greenwood. Allen testified that he began working for the Etowah County Drug Task Force in 2008 in exchange for the dismissal of a drug charge and later he made controlled buys for compensation because \u201cit made [him] feel like one of [the officers].\u201d Allen testified that he ceased working as an informant in 2009, but he resumed the work about a year later to \u201cwork off charges against his son.\u201d Allen acknowledged that his supervising agent, Agent Steve Guthrie, had told him to wait before transacting with Greenwood, but Allen sold methamphetamine to Greenwood because Guthrie said to \u201cdo whatever you have got to do\u201d to \u201cbring down the organization\u201d; Allen wanted to continue cultivating his relationship with Hernandez, whom Allen believed had connections to the Avila organization; and Allen needed to dispel suspicions expressed recently <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>by Hernandez and others that Allen was working for the government. Allen acknowledged that he did not contact Guthrie about the transaction with Greenwood, but Allen said that he hinted that he was \u201cworking on something right now\u201d to Agent Martin when he visited Allen\u2019s shop.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-5\">Guthrie testified that Allen had worked regularly as an informant for the task force; he was an \u201centhusiastic\u201d informant; and he liked to \u201cbrag [that] his initials were DEA.\u201d Guthrie testified that all government informants were instructed not to buy or sell drugs unless at the direction of the task force, but Allen had purchased drugs without permission on a couple of occasions and been allowed to continue working as an informant. Guthrie also testified that Allen had been warned to \u201cquit [making purchases without permission] ... because [the task force] can\u2019t make prosecutable cases [that] way.\u201d On cross-examination, Guthrie stated that he was introduced to Greenwood by Agent Martin; he never gave Allen permission to make uncontrolled drug purchases; he never instructed Allen to \u201cdo whatever it takes\u201d; and Allen had bought, but never sold drugs as an informant.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-6\">The government called Agent Martin to rebut Allen\u2019s testimony. Martin denied that Allen mentioned having \u201csomething going on right now\u201d or that he gestured to Greenwood to suggest that Allen was conducting a drug transaction for the government. Martin testified that Allen did not report to the task force that he had sold methamphetamine to Greenwood, nor did Allen confess immediately when he was questioned by agents. Allen renewed his motion for a judgment of acquittal on the charge of conspiracy, but the district court denied the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-7\">The jury found Allen guilty of conspiring to distribute and of distributing methamphetamine. The jury found that Allen was responsible for more than five grams, but less than 50 grams of methamphetamine that the conspiracy distributed.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-9\">Allen\u2019s presentence investigation report provided a base offense level of 28, based on the 22.2 grams of methamphetamine that he sold to Greenwood. <em>See </em>United States Sentencing Guidelines Manual \u00a7 2Dl.l(c)(6) (Nov.2012). The report increased the offense level by two points because Allen had perjured himself at trial by falsely \u201ctestifying] that he was working as a[CI] when the August [19], 2011, drug transaction took place.\u201d <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 3C1.1. With a criminal history of I and a total offense level of 30, Allen\u2019s presentence report provided a sentencing range between 97 and 121 months of imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-10\">Allen objected to the two-point enhancement of his sentence for obstruction of justice on the ground that he did not give \u201cwillful and intentional perjured testimony at trial,\u201d and he also sought a reduction of two points under the \u201csafety valve,\u201d <em>see </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(16); 18 U.S.C \u00a7 3553(f). The government responded that Allen perjured himself by testifying that he was working as an informant on August 19, 2011. The government also argued that Allen failed to qualify for the safety valve because he \u201cmaintained through the course of the trial ... that he was working under the direction of the Government when he sold methamphetamine .... \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b585-12\">The district court overruled Allen\u2019s objections to the presentence investigation report. The district court credited the testimony from Martin and Guthrie that \u201cAllen had never been instructed to sell methamphetamine to anyone at any time\u201d and that \u201c[h]is sole function as a confidential informant was to purchase controlled substances usually while wearing the wire or video equipment and providing information\u201d against Hernandez and another co-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>conspirator. Based on its findings that the agents\u2019 testimonies were \u201ccredible and truthful\u201d and that \u201cAllen lied,\u201d the district court determined that an enhancement for obstruction was \u201ca correct attribution for [Allen\u2019s] false testimony during trial\u201d and for \u201cthe denials that he made in [the] Rule 11 plea colloquy.\u201d The district court ruled that Allen\u2019s false statements \u201calso deprive[d] him of the benefit of the ... safety valve under Guideline Section 501.2(a)(5), and ... its ... statutory corollary Title 18, U.S.Code, Section 3558(f)(5).\u201d The district court adopted the factual findings and calculations in the presentence report, sentenced Allen to two terms of 97 months of imprisonment, and ordered that the terms run concurrently.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-4\">II. STANDARDS OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b586-5\">We apply three standards of review. We review the refusal of the district court to enter a plea of guilty for abuse of discretion. <em>See United States v. Gomez-Gomez, </em>822 F.2d 1008, 1010 (11th Cir.1987). We review <em>de novo </em>the denial of a motion for acquittal based on the sufficiency of the evidence and interpret all inferences and credibility choices in favor of the jury\u2019s verdicts. <em>United States v. Isnadin, </em>742 F.3d 1278, 1303 (11th Cir.2014). We review for clear error the enhancement of a sentence for obstruction of justice and the denial of relief under the safety valve, <em>United States v. Singh, </em>291 F.3d 756, 763 (11th Cir.2002) (obstruction); <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>375 F.3d 1300, 1301 (11th Cir.2004) (safety valve), and we \u201caccord great deference to the district court\u2019s credibility determinations,\u201d <em>Singh, </em>291 F.3d at 763.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-7\">III. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b586-8\">Allen argues for vacatur of his convictions and his sentence on three grounds. First, Allen argues that the district court erred in refusing to accept his plea of guilty to distributing methamphetamine \u201con [an] erroneous legal conclusion that there is a \u2018good faith\u2019 defense to the offense of distribution of a controlled substance.\u201d Second, Allen argues that there is insufficient evidence to support his conviction for conspiracy to distribute methamphetamine. Third, Allen argues that the district court clearly erred by finding that he gave false testimony and by enhancing his sentence for obstruction of justice without specifying that the false testimony was material. Allen\u2019s arguments fail. We address each in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-10\">\n<em>A. The District Court Did Not Abuse Its Discretion by Refusing to Accept Allen\u2019s Tendered Plea of Guilty.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b586-12\">\u201c[W]e give the utmost deference to the decision of the trial judge in rejecting guilty pleas.\u201d <em>Gomez-Gomez, </em>822 F.2d at 1011. A defendant has no absolute right to have a plea of guilty accepted by the district court, <em>id. </em>at 1010, and \u201c[w]hen a defendant attempts to couple a guilty plea with an assertion of facts that would negate his guilt, a judge may properly treat this assertion as a protestation of innocence\u201d and \u201cis not required to ... enter judgment upon a guilty plea under these circumstances,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 1011. \u201c[W]hen a defendant casts doubts upon the validity of his guilty plea by protesting his innocence or by making exculpatory statements, the court may resolve such doubts against the plea.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b586-13\">The district court did not abuse its discretion when it refused to accept Allen\u2019s plea of guilty. During the change of plea hearing, Allen stated that someone had threatened to harm him if he did not plead guilty. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Crim.P. 11(b)(2) (requiring the district court to determine that the defendant is entering a plea of guilty voluntary and not due to coercion or prom<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>ises). And Allen asserted repeatedly that he sold the methamphetamine on behalf of the county drug task force. <em>See id. </em>11(b)(1)(B) (requiring the district court to ensure that the defendant understands that he has the right to \u201cpersist\u201d in a plea of not guilty). Allen insisted that he conducted the drug transaction to maintain the confidence of a drug seller whom he believed he could use to infiltrate a large-scale drug organization. Even after Allen consulted with his attorney, who acknowledged that the evidence was sufficient to substantiate a plea of guilty, and Allen admitted the elements of the distribution offense, he maintained that he was innocent. Allen likens his situation to <em>United States v. Martinez, </em>486 F.2d 15 (5th Cir.1973), where the district court erred by refusing to accept a plea of guilty on the ground that Martinez\u2019s statement to authorities was arguably coerced and rendered his tendered plea involuntary. <em>Id. </em>at 21. But, unlike Martinez, who \u201cfreely admitted his guilt,\u201d <em>id., </em>Allen contended that he was innocent because he distributed methamphetamine in cooperation with the task force and in the belief that he had been instructed to do \u201cwhatever [he] had to do to get to the Avilas.\u201d Allen argues that the district court erred by reasoning that he had a viable \u201cinnocent intent\u201d or \u201cpublic authority\u201d defense, but Allen asserted that his actions were the result of a mistake of fact that would not be consistent with criminal intent. <em>See United States v. Tobin, </em>676 F.3d 1264, 1280 (11th Cir.2012) (\u201c[T]he term \u2018knowingly\u2019 means that \u2018the act was performed voluntarily and intentionally, and not because of a mistake or accident.\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>United States v. Woodruff, </em>296 F.3d 1041, 1047 (11th Cir.2002)); <em>see also United States v. Baptista-Rodriguez, </em>17 F.3d 1354, 1368 n. 18 (11th Cir.1994).) Regardless of the validity of his defense, Allen\u2019s continued protestation of his innocence casted doubt on the voluntariness of his decision to plead guilty. The district court had the discretion to resolve such doubt against accepting Allen\u2019s plea of guilty. <em>See Gomez-Gomez, </em>822 F.2d at 1011.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-6\">\n<em>B. Sufficient Evidence Supports Allen\u2019s Conviction for Conspiring to Distribute Methamphetamine.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b587-7\">The district court did not err by denying Allen\u2019s motion for a judgment of acquittal on the charge of conspiring to distribute methamphetamine. To convict Allen, the government had to prove that Allen agreed with Hernandez to distribute methamphetamine; Allen knew the purpose of the agreement; and Allen knowingly and voluntarily participated in the agreement. <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846. Allen did not dispute that on August 19, 2011, he sold methamphetamine to Greenwood; the task force had instructed him only to purchase, not to sell, methamphetamine; and he continued to consort with Hernandez after the drug task force ceased making controlled purchases from him. And the jury reasonably could have found that Allen conspired with Hernandez to sell drugs based on the evidence that Hernandez was waiting at Allen\u2019s shop for Greenwood to arrive; Allen counted Greenwood\u2019s $1,600 payment in Hernandez\u2019s presence and handed him that money; Hernandez used Allen\u2019s vehicle to transport the methamphetamine; Allen also sold marijuana to Greenwood; and Allen later demanded payment from Greenwood for the marijuana. <em>See United States v. Gianni, </em>678 F.2d 956, 959 (11th Cir.1982) (\u201cThere is rarely any direct evidence of an agreement to join a criminal conspiracy, so that a defendant\u2019s assent can be inferred from acts furthering the conspiracy\u2019s purpose.\u201d). Sufficient evidence supports Allen\u2019s conviction for conspiracy.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>Allen argues that the evidence was insufficient to prove that he had a \u201cpersonal stake\u201d in the drug transaction or that he joined in the objective of the conspiracy, but we disagree. Allen argues that he participated only in \u201can isolated instance of distribution,\u201d <em>see United States v. Hardy, </em>895 F.2d 1381, 1335 (11th Cir.1990), but the jury reasonably could have found that Allen had an ongoing agreement with Hernandez based on their past transactions and their coordinated efforts to sell methamphetamine and marijuana to Greenwood. Allen also argues that he was \u201cworkpng] to impede his alleged co-conspirators\u2019 efforts to distribute\u201d drugs, but the jury rejected Allen\u2019s testimony and credited the testimonies of Agents Martin and Guthrie that Allen was selling drugs \u201con the side,\u201d <em>see United States v. Calderon, </em>127 F.3d 1314, 1325 (11th Cir.1997) (\u201cIt is well established that credibility determinations are the exclusive province of the jury.\u201d (internal quotation marks and alteration omitted)). We will not disturb the credibility determinations of the jury, particularly when Allen does not challenge the agents\u2019 testimonies as incredible as a matter of law. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b588-4\">\n<em>C. The District Court Did Not Clearly Err by Enhancing Allen\u2019s Sentence for Obstruction of Justice or by Denying Him Relief Under the Safety Valve.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b588-5\">A defendant is subject to a two-level increase in his offense level if he \u201cwillfully obstructed or impeded, or attempted to obstruct or impede, the administration of justice with respect to the investigation, prosecution, or sentencing of the instant offense of conviction....\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1. One way in which a defendant obstructs justice is when he \u201ccommit[s], suborn[s], or attempts] to suborn perjury.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 3C1.1 cmt. n. 4. Perjury occurs when a defendant offers \u201cfalse testimony concerning a material matter with the willful intent to provide false testimony, rather than as a result of confusion, mistake, or faulty memory.\u201d <em>United States v. Dunnigan, </em>507 U.S. 87, 94, 113 S.Ct. 1111, 1116, 122 L.Ed.2d 445 (1993). Where the basis for the obstruction of justice enhancement is perjury, \u201ca general finding that an enhancement is warranted suffices if it encompasses all of the factual predicates for a perjury finding.\u201d <em>Singh, </em>291 F.3d at 763 (quoting <em>United States v. Lewis, </em>115 F.3d 1531, 1538 (11th Cir.1997)).</p>\n<p id=\"b588-7\">The district court did not clearly err when it enhanced Allen\u2019s sentence for obstruction of justice. Allen objected to the enhancement on the ground that he did not give \u201cwillful and intentional perjured testimony at trial,\u201d but the district court was entitled to make a contrary finding. The district court found that Allen\u2019s testimony about acting on behalf of the task force was irreconcilable with the testimony from Agents Martin and Guthrie that Allen never had been instructed to sell drugs and that he had not followed the routine procedures for engaging a controlled transaction on behalf of the task force. <em>See United States v. Williams, </em>627 F.3d 839, 845 (11th Cir.2010) (concluding that a defendant\u2019s testimony which is irreconcilable with evidence credited by the jury constitutes obstruction of justice). Allen\u2019s testimony warranted an enhancement for obstruction of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-8\">Allen argues that the district court failed to identify the material facts about which he testified falsely, but this argument fails. We can readily discern from the statements of the district court at sentencing that it found Allen obstructed justice by testifying falsely that he distributed methamphetamine in cooperation with the drug task force. Because Allen\u2019s per-jurious statements were woven throughout <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>his testimony, more \u201cdetailed findings [by the district court] were not necessary and would have been redundant.\u201d <em>See United States v. Smith, </em>231 F.3d 800, 820 (11th Cir.2000). Moreover, the district court was not obliged to make further findings when it adopted the statement in Allen\u2019s presentence investigation report that he \u201cperjured himself ... at trial\u201d when \u201c[h]e testified that he was working as a confidential informant when the ... drug transaction took place, when in fact, he was not,\u201d and when Allen did not ask the district court to specify what statements were material. Allen \u201cfailed to request more detailed findings of perjury at sentencing, [and] it is too late now to complain in this court.\u201d <em>United States v. Gregg, </em>179 F.3d 1312, 1317 (11th Cir.1999) (internal quotation marks, citation, and alteration omitted); <em>see, e.g., United States v. Wayerski, </em>624 F.3d 1342, 1352 (11th Cir.2010); <em>Smith, </em>231 F.3d at 820.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-5\">We will not disturb the decision of the district court to deny Allen relief under the safety valve. Allen requests an \u201copportunity to seek the safety valve adjustment\u201d if we conclude that the district court clearly erred by finding that Allen\u2019s testimony was false. Because we affirm the enhancement for obstruction of justice based on perjury, we need not consider Allen\u2019s request for the application of the safety valve.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-6\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b589-7\">We AFFIRM Allen\u2019s convictions and sentence.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
