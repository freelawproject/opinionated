Finding that the case did not present exceptional circumstances, the BIA denied the motion as untimely. The respondent has moved to dismiss the petition for want of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-5\">Because the authority to reopen an immigration proceeding sua sponte is entirely discretionary, this court lacks jurisdiction to review a challenge to the BIA\u2019s refusal to do so. <em>Ramos-Bonilla v. Mukasey, </em>543 F.3d 216, 219-20 (5th Cir.2008) (citing <em>Enriquez-Alvarado v. Ashcroft, </em>371 F.3d 246, 248 (5th Cir.2004)). <em>Kucana v. Holder, </em>558 U.S. 233, 253, 130 S.Ct. 827, 175 L.Ed.2d 694 (2010), cited by Khan, does not hold otherwise. <em>See </em>558 U.S. at 251 n. 18, 130 S.Ct. 827; <em>see also Ibarra-Gonzalez v. Holder, </em>542 Fed.Appx. 341, 341 (5th Cir.2013) (unpublished).</p>\n<p id=\"b149-6\">The respondent\u2019s motion to dismiss is GRANTED, and Khan\u2019s petition for review is DISMISSED. <em>See Ramos-Bonilla, </em>543 F.3d at 220.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b148-6\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
