Leichner, </em>181 Fed.Appx. 634, 635 (9th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b108-18\">Leichner has appealed the dismissal of his petition under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241, in which he contended that his money-laundering conviction should be vacated in light of the Supreme Court\u2019s opinion in <em>United States v. Santos, </em>553 U.S. 507, 128 S.Ct. 2020, 170 L.Ed.2d 912 (2008), and this court\u2019s decision in <em>Garland v. Roy, </em>615 F.3d 391 (5th Cir.2010). Leichner contended that he should be permitted to assert this issue in a \u00a7 2241 proceeding under the Savings Clause of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. The district court held that Leichner could not show that he was convicted of a nonexistent offense in light of <em>Santos. See Reyes-Requena v. United States, </em>243 F.3d 893, 904 (5th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b108-21\">We assume, without deciding, that <em>Santos </em>applies in the \u00a7 1957 context. <em>See United States v. Bush, </em>626 F.3d 527, 536 (9th Cir.2010); <em>United States v. Kratt, </em>579 F.3d 558, 560 (6th Cir.2009). In making the wire transfer underlying the money-laundering offense, which was to fund the purchase of a residence, Leichner was not paying essential expenses of the wire-fraud scheme, which involved foreign-currency trading. <em>See United States v. Kennedy, </em>707 F.3d 558, 567 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 133 S.Ct. 2779, 186 L.Ed.2d 227, <em>and cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 133 S.Ct. 2785, 186 L.Ed.2d 227 (2013); <em>see also Stewart v. Keffer, </em>514 Fed.Appx. 504, 507-08 (5th Cir.2013). The wire transfer involved profits of the wire-fraud scheme, which was complete at the time the money-laundering offense occurred. Therefore, no merger problem is presented. <em>See Kennedy, </em>707 F.3d at 565-67; <em>United States v. Fernandez, </em>559 F.3d 303, 317 (5th Cir.2009); <em>see also Santos, </em>553 U.S. at 517, 128 S.Ct. 2020 (\u201cInterpreting \u2018proceeds\u2019 to mean \u2018profits\u2019 eliminates the merger problem.\u201d). The district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b108-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
