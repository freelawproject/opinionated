Brown, appointed counsel for Rodney Eugene Hill in this direct criminal appeal, has moved to withdraw from further representation of the appellant and filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). J. Clark Stankowski, appointed counsel for Florence Chigozie Nna in this direct criminal appeal, has moved to withdraw from further representation of the appellant and filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396. Our independent review of the entire record reveals that counsel\u2019s assessment of the relative merit of the appeal is correct. Because independent examination of the entire record reveals no arguable issues of merit, counsels\u2019 motions to withdraw are GRANTED, and Hills\u2019s and Nna\u2019s convictions and sentences are AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
