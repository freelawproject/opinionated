The government alleged that it had discovered two firearms and eight rounds of .22 caliber ammunition pursuant to a consent search of the residence leased by Andrews\u2019s girlfriend, Taryn Young, while Andrews was present there. Prior to trial, the government and Andrews jointly submitted the following proposed jury instruction, based on the Eleventh Circuit Pattern Jury Instruction, regarding the possession element of Andrews\u2019s offense:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1006-13\">The law recognizes several kinds of possession. A person may have actual possession, constructive possession, sole possession, or joint possession.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1006-14\">\u2018Actual possession\u2019 of a thing occurs if a person knowingly has direct physical control of it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1006-15\">\u2018Constructive possession\u2019 of a thing occurs if a person doesn\u2019t have actual possession of it, but has both the power and the intention to take control over it later....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1006-16\">Possession of a thing cannot be established, however, by a person\u2019s mere presence near that thing.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1006-17\">At trial, and before the jury was instructed, Andrews submitted the following additional proposed jury instruction:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1006-18\">Possession may be actual or constructive. Constructive possession exists when a person exercises dominion or control over the contraband itself, or the premises in which the contraband is concealed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1006-19\">Dominion and control are not established by mere proximity to the contraband, mere presence on the property where it is located, or mere association with the person who controls the property. Furthermore, ambiguous and even suspicious circumstances cannot support a finding of possession unless those circumstances prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant exercised dominion or control over the contraband.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AW0K\">The district court denied Andrews\u2019s request to include the additional instruction, noting that the existing constructive-possession instruction \u201caccurately reflects the law,\u201d and instead provided the original instructions that Andrews and the government had submitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"979\">*979</page-number>Following the instructions and during its deliberations, the jury submitted, <em>inter alia, </em>the following question to the court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ANx\">Please provide clarification on the language under \u201cconstructive possession\u201d on power and the <em>intention </em>to take control over it later. It feels like \u201cintention\u201d is a hypothetical. Is this true? Or should we be thinking about this in another way?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1007-5\">Following this question, Andrews requested that instructions be given to clarify that a defendant\u2019s mere presence or \u201cmere knowledge\u201d of the existence of a firearm on the property was not, by itself, sufficient to establish possession. Also, he requested that the court respond to the jury\u2019s question by providing the instruction from his earlier submission. Andrews stated that this instruction was based on this Court\u2019s conclusion in <em>United States v. Mieres-Borges, </em>919 F.2d 652, 658 (11th Cir.1990), that the proximity of a defendant\u2019s boat to drugs in issue was not, by itself, sufficient to establish constructive possession. The district court denied Andrews\u2019s request to include the additional instruction, reasoning that the facts of <em>Mieres-Borges </em>were not analogous to Andrews\u2019s returning to his girlfriend\u2019s residence, where he sometimes visited or resided.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The jury found Andrews guilty on this count, and the court sentenced him to 96 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-6\">On appeal, Andrews challenges the district court\u2019s refusal to give his proposed jury instruction that a defendant\u2019s \u201cmere association\u201d with a person controlling a firearm is insufficient to establish constructive possession under \u00a7 922(g)(1). Andrews argues that the district court\u2019s given jury charge on possession, which included the Eleventh Circuit Pattern Jury Instruction and contained a \u201cmere presence\u201d instruction, was inadequate to substantially cover the substance of his proposed \u201cmere association\u201d instruction because the concepts of presence and association are distinct, and the jury\u2019s questions indicated that it needed additional guidance on the meaning of possession.</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-9\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-10\">\u201cWe review a district court\u2019s refusal to submit a defendant\u2019s requested jury instruction for an abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>United States v. Dominguez, </em>661 F.3d 1051, 1071 (11th Cir.2011). A district court\u2019s decision will not be disturbed if it falls within a range of possible conclusions that do not constitute a clear error of judgment. <em>United States v. Lopez, </em>649 F.3d 1222, 1236 (11th Cir.2011) (citing <em>United States v. Frazier, </em>387 F.3d 1244, 1259 (11th Cir.2004) (en banc)). In determining whether the district court abused its discretion, we consider: \u201c(1) whether the requested instruction is a substantially correct statement of the law; (2) whether the jury charge given addressed the requested instruction; and (3) whether the failure to give the requested instruction seriously impaired the defendant\u2019s ability to present an effective defense.\u201d <em>Dominguez, </em>661 F.3d at 1071 (citation omitted). Although a defendant is entitled to have instructions given relating to a theory of his defense if there is a supportive founda<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"980\">*980</page-number>tion in the evidence, a district court is afforded broad discretion in formulating its jury charge. <em>United States v. Palma, </em>511 F.3d 1311, 1315 (11th Cir.2008) (per cu-riam). A theory-of-defense charge is not warranted if \u201cthe charge given adequately covers the substance of the requested instruction.\u201d <em>United States v. Ndiaye, </em>434 F.3d 1270, 1293 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b1008-4\">Section 922(g)(1) requires that a defendant have been in knowing possession of a firearm. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1); <em>see United States v. Beckles, </em>565 F.3d 832, 841 (11th Cir.2009). Possession may be either actual or constructive. <em>United States v. Perez, </em>661 F.3d 568, 576 (11th Cir.2011) (per curiam). The government demonstrates constructive possession if it can show that the defendant \u201cwas aware or knew of the firearm\u2019s presence\u201d and \u201chad the ability and intent to later exercise dominion and control over [the] firearm.\u201d <em>Id. </em>However, a defendant\u2019s \u201cmere association\u201d with a person actually possessing the firearm at issue is insufficient, by itself, to establish constructive possession under \u00a7 922(g). <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1008-5\">We have held that it is not an abuse of discretion for a district court to give the Pattern Instruction on constructive firearm possession, even if the district court declines to include verbatim a specific instruction requested by a defendant in support of his defense theory. <em>See United States v. Woodard, </em>531 F.3d 1352, 1364-65 (11th Cir.2008) (affirming the district court\u2019s denial in part of a defendant\u2019s request for a \u201cmere presence\u201d instruction to support his defense theory, as it was substantially covered by the pattern instruction requiring a defendant to have \u201cthe power and the intention to later take control\u201d over a firearm).</p>\n<p id=\"b1008-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b1008-7\">Upon review, we find that the district court did not abuse its discretion in declining to give Andrews\u2019s proposed instruction that a defendant\u2019s \u201cmere association\u201d with a person controlling a firearm is insufficient to establish constructive possession under \u00a7 922(g)(1). First, the jury charge that the district court gave \u2014 initially proposed by both parties \u2014 was a \u201csubstantially correct statement of the law.\u201d <em>Dominguez, </em>661 F.3d at 1071. Second, the jointly requested instruction was comprised of the Pattern Instruction regarding the definition of possession in its entirety, and encompassed Andrews\u2019s proposed instruction regarding \u201cmere association,\u201d which the court was not required to include. <em>See Woodard, </em>531 F.3d at 1358, 1364. Andrews\u2019s concern was ensuring the jury understood that it could not convict him of possessing the rifle and ammunition merely on the basis of his association with Young. However, the court\u2019s given instruction adequately covered the substance of Andrews\u2019s proposed instruction because the instruction expressly required that a person have both the power to possess a firearm and the intention to take control over it later. <em>See Dominguez, </em>661 F.3d at 1071. Neither of these requirements would have been satisfied by Andrews\u2019s mere presence on the premises or association with its occupants. This conclusion is consistent with our Court\u2019s holding that a district court did not abuse its discretion in declining to give a requested \u201cmere presence\u201d instruction because it was substantially covered by the court\u2019s pattern instruction including the same power and intention prerequisites. <em>See Woodard, </em>531 F.3d at 1364-65.</p>\n<p id=\"b1008-9\">Third, given that Andrews, as the lessee\u2019s boyfriend, was present at the residence at least every weekend as a house-guest, there is little functional distinction between Andrews\u2019s \u201cmere presence\u201d at the residence, included in the court\u2019s instructions, and his \u201cmere associations\u201d with its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"981\">*981</page-number>occupants. Therefore, it is clear that the court\u2019s failure to give the requested instruction did not \u201cseriously impair[] the defendant\u2019s ability to present an effective defense.\u201d <em>Dominguez, </em>661 F.3d at 1071.</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-5\">Finally, there is little basis for concluding, as Andrews contends, that the jury was confused concerning his association with Young based on its question submitted to the court during deliberations. If anything, the jury\u2019s question suggests that it was grappling with the issue of whether or not Andrews had intended to later take possession of the revolver, rifle, or ammunition discovered at Young\u2019s residence. This was not conceptually related to inferring possession from Andrews\u2019s association with Young, nor could it have been clarified by Andrews\u2019s proposed instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-6\">For the aforementioned reasons, the district court did not abuse its discretion by failing to give Andrews\u2019s request jury instruction. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1007-7\">. The government requested that the court provide the jury with examples of constructive possession from the Eleventh Circuit criminal handbook and an instruction that the government need not prove a defendant\u2019s actual possession, both of which the court denied. Instead, the district court responded to the jury\u2019s questions as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1007-11\">While I am not sure I fully understand your two questions, I refer you to the Court\u2019s instructions on page 10, while bearing in mind that you must consider all of the Court\u2019s instructions as a whole and may not single out or disregard any of the Court\u2019s instructions. If you want to clarify your questions, I would be happy to answer them.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
