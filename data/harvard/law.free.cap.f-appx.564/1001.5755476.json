Ferdarko, a City of Roswell, Georgia police officer, appeals from the district court\u2019s denial of qualified immunity on summary judgment. Plaintiff, Sandra Gray, moves to dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction. Gray\u2019s claim arises from her arrest for criminal damage to the property of Gregory Pompelia, her tenant, during her attempt to remove him from her home without seeking a writ of dispossession.</p>\n<p id=\"AhL\">The district court\u2019s summary judgment order denying qualified immunity to Fer-darko is immediately appealable as a collateral order because Ferdarko\u2019s challenge is based in part on a question of law. In his brief, Ferdarko challenges the district court\u2019s legal analysis of Georgia criminal trespass statutes, O.C.G.A. \u00a7 16-7-21 and \u00a7 16-7-23, to consider whether those statutes provide arguable probable cause to arrest Gray, and whether the district court used an improper standard to determine whether the law clearly proscribed the conduct complained of. Thus, Ferdarko\u2019s appeal presents questions of law which are properly before this Court on interlocutory review. <em>See Cottrell v. Caldwell, </em>85 F.3d 1480, 1485 (11th Cir.1996). To the extent that the appeal also implicates the district court\u2019s factual determinations, we may review and resolve such issues in connection with the immunity question. <em>Id. </em>at 1485-86. Therefore, we DENY the motion to dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"AI9\">On review, we agree with the district court that the evidence Gray presents in support of her false arrest claim, when viewed in the light most favorable to her, suggests that there was no basis for believing that she committed a crime and that there was no probable cause, arguable or otherwise, to support her arrest. Therefore, the district court\u2019s denial of summary judgment as to Ferdarko\u2019s affirmative defense of qualified immunity was not in error.</p>\n<p id=\"ADB\">MOTION TO DISMISS DENIED. AFFIRMED and REMANDED for further proceedings.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
