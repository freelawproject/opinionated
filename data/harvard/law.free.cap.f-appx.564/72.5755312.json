California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), and <em>United States v. Flores, </em>632 F.3d 229 (5th Cir.2011). Agopian has filed a re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>sponse. She also moves this court for the appointment of new counsel on appeal and moves to strike the <em>Anders </em>brief filed in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-5\">The record is insufficiently developed to allow consideration at this time of Agopi-an\u2019s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel; such a claim generally \u201ccannot be resolved on direct appeal when the claim has not been raised before the district court since no opportunity existed to develop the record on the merits of the allegations.\u201d <em>United States v. Cantwell, </em>470 F.3d 1087, 1091 (5th Cir.2006) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). We have reviewed counsel\u2019s brief and the relevant portions of the record reflected therein, as well as Agopian\u2019s response. We concur with counsel\u2019s assessment that the appeal presents no nonfrivolous issue for appellate review. Accordingly, the motion for leave to withdraw is GRANTED, counsel is excused from further responsibilities herein, and the APPEAL IS DISMISSED. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2. Agopian\u2019s motion for appointment of counsel on appeal and her motion to strike counsel\u2019s <em>Anders </em>brief are also DENIED. <em>See United States v. Wagner, </em>158 F.3d 901, 902-03 (5th Cir.1998).</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b100-6\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
