He appeals from the dismissal of his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 petition challenging his counts of conviction. We review the dismissal de novo. <em>Pack v. Yusuff, </em>218 F.3d 448, 451 (5th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b155-7\">As the district court determined, because Lamberti Ledezma seeks to challenge the validity of his conviction, rather than the manner in which his sentence has been executed, his petition properly arises under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. <em>See Pack, </em>218 F.3d at 451-52. Lamberti Ledezma may not use \u00a7 2241 as a vehicle to challenge his conviction because he has not shown that \u00a7 2255 \u201cis inadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his detention.\u201d <em>Reyes-Requena v. United States, </em>243 F.3d 893, 904 (5th Cir.2001). A \u00a7 2255 motion must be filed by the movant in the court that convicted him. \u00a7 2255(a); <em>Ojo v. INS, </em>106 F.3d 680, 683 (5th Cir.1997). Because the district court did not enter the judgment of conviction, it did not err in dismissing the petition rather than construing it as a \u00a7 2255 motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b155-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
