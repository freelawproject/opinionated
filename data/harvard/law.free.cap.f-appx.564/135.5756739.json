Chisley, Jr., Louisiana prisoner #86581, as time barred. Alternatively, the court determined that his challenge to his 30-year sentence at hard labor under state law was not cognizable in federal habeas review. The district court granted a certificate of appealability (COA), stating that Chisley \u201calleges the sentence imposed upon him violated Louisiana\u2019s habitual offender statute, La.Rev.Stat. ANN. \u00a7 15:529.1.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b163-19\">Chisley contends that his application was timely and that his sentence violated his rights to due process and equal protection under the United States Constitution. However, it appears that the district court\u2019s grant of a COA was limited to the non-dispositive and non-constitutional state law sentencing issue, and Chisley does not request a COA from this court to appeal the rulings that his application was time barred and not cognizable under \u00a7 2254. <em>See United States v. Kimler, </em>150 F.3d 429, 431 &amp; n. 1 (5th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b163-20\">We are not authorized to consider issues beyond the scope of the COA. <em>See Simmons v. Epps, </em>654 F.3d 526, 535 (5th Cir.2011). Because it is unclear whether the district court\u2019s grant of a COA encompasses the dispositive issues for appeal, we VACATE the COA order and REMAND for clarification as to whether Chisley has shown that jurists of reason would find it debatable whether his \u00a7 2254 application \u201cstates a valid claim of the denial of a constitutional right and that jurists of reason would find it debatable whether the district court was correct in its procedural ruling[s].\u201d <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000); <em>see United States v. Ratliff, </em>719 F.3d 422, 424 (5th Cir.2013) (28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 case).</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b163-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
