The district court denied the motion after finding that the Government had already returned all property belonging to Oduu in its possession.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-10\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-11\">In September 2011, officers with the Denham Springs Police Department stopped a rental car driven by Ndem Oduu for speeding. After obtaining Oduu\u2019s consent to search the car, the officers found, inter alia, four counterfeit driver\u2019s licenses; 22 prepaid debit cards; an Acer Aspire One laptop computer; an Iomega external hard drive; lists containing the names, dates of birth, social security numbers, and addresses of about 97 individuals; and $3,557.76 in cash. The officers arrested Oduu.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-16\">The officers contacted Jacquelyn Norris, a special agent with the United States Secret Service. Norris met the officers, examined the evidence recovered during the traffic stop, and interviewed Oduu.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-17\">In October 2011, a federal grand jury charged Oduu with possession of 15 or more unauthorized access devices in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1029(a)(3) (count one) and identity theft in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1028(a)(7) (count two). The indictment also contained a forfeiture allegation, which indicated that Oduu would forfeit \u201cany personal property used or intended to be used to commit the offense ... and property constituting, or derived from, proceeds the defendant obtained, directly or indirectly, as the result of\u2019 the offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-18\">Oduu eventually pleaded guilty to count one pursuant to a written plea agreement. In his plea agreement, Oduu waived his right to appeal his conviction and sentence, reserving only his right to (1) appeal any punishment that (a) exceeded the statutory maximum, (b) constituted an upward departure pursuant to the Guidelines, or (c) was above the Guidelines range calculated by the court, and (2) bring an ineffective assistance claim. Oduu also agreed to forfeit (1) all funds contained in accounts associated with the 22 prepaid debit cards, including but not limited to $27,144.02 that had been seized pursuant to a warrant; (2) the Acer Aspire One laptop computer; and (3) the Iomega external hard drive. Oduu <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>waived his right to appeal or collaterally challenge the forfeiture.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-4\">The district court sentenced Oduu to 51 months in prison, which was at the top of his advisory Guidelines range of imprisonment, and two years of supervised release. Oduu timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-5\">While his appeal was pending, Oduu filed a second pro se Rule 41(g) motion for the return of personal property not subject to forfeiture. Specifically, Oduu requested that the Government return $3555.70 in cash, a driver\u2019s license, school books, passports, clothing, and other personal items that were in his rental car when he was arrested. The Government responded to Oduu\u2019s motion, asserting that it did not possess the personal property Oduu was seeking to have returned. The Government explained that it had seized only the property which was subject to forfeiture and that the Denham Springs Police Department might have the remainder of Oduu\u2019s property since it had impounded Oduu\u2019s rental car. However, the Government did admit that it had found within its possession Oduu\u2019s driver\u2019s license, and stated that it had mailed the driver\u2019s license to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-6\">The district court denied Oduu\u2019s motion since the Government had \u201creturned all property of [Oduu] that it ever had in [its] possession.\u201d The next day, the district court received Oduu\u2019s reply to the Government\u2019s response. In his reply, Oduu conceded that the Denham Springs Police Department had his cash. He maintained, however, that the Secret Service had seized all of his other property. Oduu timely appealed the district court\u2019s denial of his motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-11\">We subsequently affirmed Oduu\u2019s conviction and sentence.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b157-12\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-13\">Oduu argues that the district court erred in denying his Rule 41(g) motion. He contends that the Government\u2019s response to his first motion (i.e., that it would advise him how to retrieve any property it may have) indicates that the Government has his property.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-14\">The Government has moved for summary affirmance, contending that no error occurred. The Government contends that although Agent Norris seized the property Oduu used to commit the offense of conviction, she did not seize the property Oduu is seeking to have returned. The Government alternatively argues that Oduu\u2019s appeal is barred by the appeal waivers in his plea agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-15\">In his reply, Oduu argues that the district court erred in relying on the Government\u2019s bare assertion that it did not possess the property. He also contends that the appeal waivers are inapplicable since he is seeking the return of properties not subject to forfeiture.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-16\">Summary affirmance is proper when \u201ctime is truly of the essence or where the position of one of the parties is clearly right as a matter of law so that there can be no substantial question as to the outcome of the case.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The summary affir-mance procedure is generally reserved for cases in which the parties concede that the issues are foreclosed by circuit precedent.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>Oduu does not concede that his argument is foreclosed, and the Government has failed to identify controlling authority foreclosing Oduu\u2019s argument. Thus, we DENY the motion for summary affirmance.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b158-4\">However, we DISPENSE with further briefing as the Government\u2019s motion and Oduu\u2019s response adequately address the parties\u2019 positions.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-5\">A person whose property has been seized by the government may file a motion under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 41(g), formerly codified in Rule 41(e),<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> for the return of the property:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b158-6\">A person aggrieved by an unlawful search and seizure of property or by the deprivation of property may move for the property\u2019s return. The motion must be filed in the district where the property was seized. The court must receive evidence on any factual issue necessary to decide the motion. If it grants the motion, the court must return the property to the movant, but may impose reasonable conditions to protect access to the property and its use in later proceedings.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b158-7\">We review de novo a district court\u2019s interpretation of Rule 41(g), and review factual determinations concerning ownership or lawful possession for clear error.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b158-13\">Here, both parties disputed at the district court whether the Government ever possessed the non-forfeited property that Oduu seeks. A finding that the government actually possesses the property sought is a necessary predicate to the resolution of a Rule 41(g) motion.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b158-14\">The real question presented here is which party bears the evidentiary burden under a Rule 41(g) motion? \u201cIf a motion for return of property is made while a criminal prosecution is pending, the burden is on the movant to show that he or she is entitled to the property.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> But when criminal proceedings have ended, that burden shifts to the Government.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Hence, \u201c[a] criminal defendant is presumed to have the right to return of his property once it is no longer needed as evidence.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Indeed, the termination of criminal proceedings does not simply shift the burden but also changes how we deal with Rule 41(g) motions in general. When a defendant files a Rule 41(g) motion after the criminal proceedings have concluded, we treat the motion as a civil action under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331 and treat the district court\u2019s denial of that motion as a grant of summary judgment in favor of the government.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b158-15\">Here, Oduu filed his Rule 41(g) motion while his direct criminal appeal was pending. Therefore, criminal proceedings had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>not yet ended, and he had to bear the burden. In his district court pleadings, Oduu asserted that the Government was in possession of the property he was seeking to recover. He failed, however, to offer any evidence in support of his assertion. In his appellate brief, Oduu again fails to offer any evidence in support of his assertion that the Government is in possession of his property. Oduu\u2019s reliance of the Government\u2019s conditional response to his first motion (i.e., that it would return whatever non-forfeited property it may have) is unavailing as it clearly does not indicate that any such property even existed.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-7\">Oduu\u2019s argument that it was error for the district court to rely on the Government\u2019s bare assertion fails to persuade. It is true that our sister courts have remanded for fact-finding in cases where in the face of a Rule 41(g) motion the government contended that the property had already been destroyed.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> However, in those cases, the government\u2019s bare assertion was not enough because the government had to bear the burden.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> That is not the case here.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-8\">Accordingly, Oduu has failed to show that the district court erred in denying his motion. The district court\u2019s decision is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b156-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
