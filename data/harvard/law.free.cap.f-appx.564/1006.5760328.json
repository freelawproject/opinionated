Concerning her ADA and Rehabilitation Act claims, Horsley argues that the district court erred in: (1) failing to apply the four-year \u201ccatch-all\u201d statute of limitations under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1658, for federal claims created after 1990; (2) failing to apply the ten-year statute of limitations under Aa-bama Code \u00a7 6-2-33, for actions founded upon a contract or writing under seal; and (3) in concluding that the limitations period was not equitably tolled. Ater careful review, we affirm.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1036-3\">We review <em>de novo </em>the grant of a 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss, accepting the complaint\u2019s factual allegations as true and further construing them in a light most favorable to the plaintiff. <em>Glover v. Liggett Group, Inc., </em>459 F.3d 1304, 1308 (11th Cir.2006). The application of statutes of limitations is likewise subject to <em>de novo </em>review. <em>Center for Biological Diversity v. Hamilton, </em>453 F.3d 1331, 1334 (11th Cir.2006). Dismissal under Rule 12(b)(6) \u201con statute of limitations grounds is appropriate only if it is apparent from the face of the complaint that the claim is time-barred.\u201d <em>Tello v. Dean Witter Reynolds, Inc., </em>410 F.3d 1275, 1288 (11th Cir.2005) (quotation omitted). When considering a motion to dismiss, the district court should limit its consideration to the pleadings and any exhibits attached thereto. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1036-4\">A four-year statute of limitations applies to any federal claim that was made possible by a post-1990 enactment. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1658(a); <em>see Jones v. R.R. Donnelley &amp; Sons Co., </em>541 U.S. 369, 382, 124 S.Ct. 1836, 158 L.Ed.2d 645 (2004). However, for discrimination claims under Title II of the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act, which were both enacted prior to 1990, the applicable limitations period is governed by the most analogous state statute of limitations. <em>Everett v. Cobb Cnty. Sch. Dist., </em>138 F.3d 1407, 1409-10 (11th Cir.1998). In Aa-bama, where this action was brought, the applicable limitations period is two years. ALA. CODE \u00a7 6 \u2014 2\u201438(\u00bf) (providing that non-enumerated actions for any injury to the person or rights of another not arising from contract must be brought within two years).</p>\n<p id=\"b1036-9\">A limitations period begins to run when a cause of action accrues. <em>Rozar v. Mullis, </em>85 F.3d 556, 561 (11th Cir.1996). A cause of action ordinarily \u201cwill not accrue, and thereby set the limitations clock running, until the plaintiff[ ] know[s] or should know (1) that [she] ha[s] suffered the injury that forms the basis of [her] complaint and (2) who has inflicted the injury.\u201d <em>Chappell v. Rich, </em>340 F.3d 1279, 1283 (11th Cir.2003). In general, once a limitations period has run, the action is barred, regardless of the merits of the plaintiffs claims. <em>Arce v. Garcia, </em>434 F.3d 1254, 1260-61 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b1036-10\">However, statutes of limitation may be subject to equitable tolling. <em>United States v. Locke, </em>471 U.S. 84, 94 n. 10, 105 S.Ct. 1785, 85 L.Ed.2d 64 (1985); <em>Cook v. Deltona Corp., </em>753 F.2d 1552, 1562 (11th Cir.1985). Equitable tolling is an extraordinary remedy to be applied sparingly, and is appropriate when a plaintiff untimely files due to extraordinary circumstances that are both beyond her control and un<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1009\">*1009</page-number>avoidable even with diligence. <em>Arce, </em>434 F.3d at 1261. We have emphasized that equitable tolling typically requires some affirmative misconduct, such as fraud, misinformation, or deliberate concealment, and that \u201cignorance of the law does not, on its own, satisfy the constricted extraordinary circumstances test.\u201d <em>Jackson v. </em>As<em>true, </em>506 F.3d 1349, 1356 (11th Cir.2007) (quotation omitted). Likewise, we have previously rejected the notion that <em>pro se </em>status, ignorance of the judicial process, or slow administrative proceedings can warrant the application of equitable tolling. <em>Wakefield v. R.R. Ret. Bd., </em>131 F.3d 967, 970 (11th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b1037-5\">Here, the district court did not err in dismissing Horsley\u2019s ADA and Rehabilitation Act claims by applying the two-year statute of limitations. Horsley\u2019s complaint alleged that she had a disability and that the Defendants violated Title II of the ADA and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act by failing to accommodate her disability. While Horsley argued in subsequent pleadings that her claims were not cognizable before the enactment of the ADA Amendments Act in 2008 and that she and the Defendants had a contract under seal, our case law makes clear that dismissal under Rule 12(b)(6) on statute of limitations grounds depends only on \u201cthe face of the complaint.\u201d <em>Tello, </em>410 F.3d at 1288. Thus, the district court properly limited its consideration to the face of Horsley\u2019s complaint and ignored any arguments in Hors-ley\u2019s subsequent pleadings.</p>\n<p id=\"b1037-6\">Based on the face of the complaint, the district court properly dismissed Horsley\u2019s claims as barred by the two-year statute of limitations because the claims were untimely. <em>See Everett, </em>138 F.3d at 1409-10. Horsley received her grades for the fall semester of 2007 and the spring semester of 2010 in December of 2007 and May of 2010, respectively. Furthermore, the open confrontation regarding Horsley\u2019s absences and other personal information took place on February 28, 2010. Finally, the Defendants\u2019 request that Horsley sign the release of claim form was made on July 22, 2010. Accordingly, by July 22, 2010 at the latest, Horsley knew that she had suffered an injury, and that it was a result of the Defendants\u2019 failure to accommodate her disability. <em>See Chappell, </em>340 F.3d at 1283. Yet she failed to file a complaint until February 1, 2013, beyond the two-year statute of limitations period. <em>See Everett, </em>138 F.3d at 1409-10.</p>\n<p id=\"b1037-8\">Furthermore, Horsley has failed to establish the extraordinary circumstances that would warrant equitable tolling. Horsley asserted no facts in her complaint indicating that her untimely filing was the result of circumstances beyond her control and unavoidable even with diligence. <em>See Arce, </em>434 F.3d at 1261. While it is true that Horsley was actively pursuing numerous appeals during the intervening period between the time she suffered the injury and the time she filed her complaint, she has alleged no reason that she could not have concurrently pursued a federal court action. Moreover, although Horsley alleged in her brief that the Defendants provided fraudulent information to and withheld information from the appeals boards, Horsley did not allege any affirmative misconduct in her complaint. <em>See Astrue, </em>506 F.3d at 1356. Accordingly, we affirm the dismissal of Horsley\u2019s ADA and Rehabilitation Act claims as time-barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b1037-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1036-5\">. Notably, Horsley does not address the district court\u2019s dismissal of her claims under FERPA and Alabama Code \u00a7\u00a7 16-38-2 and 21-9-1. Therefore, she has abandoned any arguments related to these claims. See <em>Timson v. Sampson, </em>518 F.3d 870, 874 (11th Cir.2008) (\u2018\u2018[I]ssues not briefed on appeal by a <em>pro se </em>litigant are deemed abandoned.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
