In the brief he filed in support of his petition, Petitioner argues that the BIA \u201cviolated its regulatory duty by failing to review the IJ\u2019s factual findings,\u201d Petitioner\u2019s Br. at 12, pursuant to 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 lOOS.RdXSXi).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The BIA purportedly shirked this duty because there was evidence in the record establishing that the IJ\u2019s factual findings about his family\u2019s good health were clearly erroneous. Alternatively, assuming that the BIA reviewed the findings, Petitioner argues the review was \u201cdeficient because it ignored material record evidence,\u201d Petitioner\u2019s Br. at 18, including documentation about his daughter\u2019s significant medical conditions. The Attorney General argues that we do not have jurisdiction to hear the claim, pursuant to Immigration and Nationality Act (\u201cINA\u201d) \u00a7 242(a)(2)(B), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B), because the denial of cancellation of removal is a discretionary decision not subject to appellate review.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b507-14\">\u201cThe Attorney General ... has discretion to cancel the removal of a nonperman-ent resident if that alien has (A) a continuous physical presence of not less than 10 years, (B) good moral character, (C) a lack of certain criminal convictions, and (D) establishes exceptional and extremely unusual hardship to a qualifying relative.\u201d <em>Gonzalez-Oropeza v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>321 F.3d 1331, 1332 (11th Cir.2003) (citing INA \u00a7 240A(b)(l), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(b)(1)). Assuming the alien has established the first three points, whether the alien\u2019s removal is cancelled turns on whether the Attorney General decides that the alien\u2019s removal would subject a qualifying relative \u2014 in this case, Petitioner\u2019s children \u2014 to exceptional and extremely unusual hardship. That decision is a discretionary call and, as such, is not subject to judicial review. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B);<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>Gonzalez-Oropeza, </em>321 F.3d at 1332-33; <em>Najjar v. Ashcroji, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1297-98 (11th Cir.2001). Notwithstanding this jurisdictional bar, though, \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B) affords judicial review of a cancellation-of-removal decision <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>that presents a \u201cgenuine ... question of law,\u201d <em>Jimenez-Galicia v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>690 F.3d 1207, 1209 (11th Cir.2012), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 183 S.Ct. 2824, 186 L.Ed.2d 883 (2013), which we review <em>de novo, Zhu v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>703 F.3d 1303, 1307 (11th Cir.2013). Petitioner\u2019s argument that the BIA violated its regulatory duty by failing to review the IJ\u2019s factual findings presents a question of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-6\">The BIA reviews an IJ\u2019s factual findings for clear error. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(d)(3)(i)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> ; <em>Zhu, </em>703 F.3d at 1305, 1308-09. In order to review an IJ\u2019s factual findings for clear error, the appealing petitioner must identify and inform the BIA of the factual finding that, he contends, is clearly erroneous. That is, he must exhaust the administrative remedy the law provides him; he must ask the BIA to set aside the finding. INA \u00a7 242(d)(1); 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d)(1).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The presence of this statutory exhaustion requirement means that the BIA is not required to review each of the IJ\u2019s factual findings on its own initiative. This explains why, in <em>Amaya-Artunduaga v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>463 F.3d 1247, 1250-51 (11th Cir.2006), we dismissed a petition asking us to review the BIA\u2019s sua sponte review of the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility finding.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b508-11\">Although the petition for review before us presents a question of law, we decline to consider the question because to do so would sanction Petitioner\u2019s avoidance of \u00a7 1252(d)(l)\u2019s exhaustion requirement. His petition for review is therefore denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-12\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b507-8\">. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1, Organization, jurisdiction, and powers of the Board of Immigration Appeals, provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-10\">(d) Powers of the Board\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-11\">(3) Scope of review.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-12\">(i) The Board will not engage in de novo review of findings of fact determined by an immigration judge.

The court's opinion in <em>Amaya-Artunduaga v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen. </em>seems to imply that 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d)(1) contains an \"excuse or exception\u201d to its exhaustion requirement. <em>Amaya-Artunduaga v. U.S. Atty. Gen., </em>463 F.3d 1247, 1250 (11th Cir.2006). As the <em>Amaya-Artun-duaga </em>panel put it, \"circuit precedent clearly states that, absent a cognizable excuse or exception, 'we lack jurisdiction to consider claims that have not been raised before the BIA.' \" <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Sundar v. I.N.S., </em>328 F.3d 1320, 1323 (11th Cir.2003)). <em>Sundar </em>was an appeal of the District Court\u2019s denial of a petition for a writ of habeas corpus under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241. <em>Sundar, </em>328 F.3d at 1321. The \"question [before the court was] whether \u00a7 1252(d)(l)\u2019s exhaustion requirement applies in \u00a7 2241 habeas proceedings or only in direct appeals to this Court from the BIA.\" <em>Sundar, </em>328 F.3d at 1321. The court concluded that it applies. <em>Id. </em>The court then addressed the question of whether \"perceived futility\u201d provided an exception to the exhaustion requirement of the habeas statute, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254, and concluded that it did not \u2014 with this statement: \"The decision in <em>Engle v. Isaac, </em>456 U.S. 107, 130, 102 S.Ct. 1558, 1573, 71 L.Ed.2d 783 (1982), establishes that perceived futility is no exception to the exhaustion requirement contained in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254, and it should not be an exception to the one contained in 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d)(1), either.\u201d <em>Sundar, </em>328 F.3d at 1325.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-15\">Because the <em>Sundar </em>court was deciding whether the habeas statute contained a \"perceived futility\u201d exception to its exhaustion doctrine and because Petitioner does not argue that he did not need to identify the IJ factual findings he considered clearly erroneous, we consider the court\u2019s reference to \u00a7 1252(d)(1) as <em>dicta </em>and, moreover, need not explore the possibility that \u00a7 1252(d)(1) provides an excuse or exception that would allow a petitioner to insist that the BIA examine <em>sua sponte </em>an IJ\u2019s factual findings.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
