Stat. \u00a7 944.40 was not a violent felony in light of <em>Begay v. United States, </em>553 U.S. 137, 128 S.Ct. 1581, 170 L.Ed.2d 490 (2008), and <em>Chambers v. United States, </em>555 U.S. 122, 129 S.Ct. 687, 172 L.Ed.2d 484 (2009). Thus, he contended he had been incorrectly sentenced as an armed career criminal under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e), and was \u201cactually innocent\u201d of the sentencing enhancement. The district court originally dismissed Chaplin\u2019s petition after finding the savings clause was inapplicable. On appeal in 2012, we accepted the Government\u2019s concession that Chaplin could utilize the savings clause to bring his petition, and remanded for the district court to consider his petition on the merits. After <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>the district court denied the petition on the merits on remand, Chaplin again appeals on the ground that his prior conviction for escape under Fla. Stat. \u00a7 944.40 was not a violent felony under the Armed Career Criminal Act (ACCA).</p>\n<p id=\"b467-5\">Although we previously remanded Chaplin\u2019s \u00a7 2241 petition to the district court for consideration of the merits based on the Government\u2019s concession that the savings clause applied, we have recently held the applicability of the savings clause is a threshold jurisdictional issue that cannot be waived. <em>Williams v. Warden, </em>713 F.3d 1332, 1337-38 (11th Cir.2013); <em>see also Bryant v. Warden, </em>738 F.3d 1253, 1271 (11th Cir.2013) (holding we could not accept the government\u2019s concession regarding the applicability of the savings clause). Thus, we may no longer rely on the Government\u2019s concession. Because the applicability of the savings clause is a threshold jurisdictional issue that cannot be waived, we must <em>sua sponte </em>determine whether we have subject matter jurisdiction by determining whether the savings clause applies. <em>See Williams, </em>713 F.3d at 1340-41.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-6\">In <em>Williams, </em>the petitioner filed a \u00a7 2241 petition for habeas corpus, alleging his prior burglary convictions under Fla. Stat. \u00a7 810.02, were not violent felonies for purposes of the ACCA sentencing enhancement. <em>Id. </em>at 1334-35. Because of the ACCA enhancement, he was sentenced to a term of imprisonment above the otherwise applicable ten-year statutory maximum sentence. <em>Id. </em>at 1334. We explained that, for the savings clause to apply, a prisoner\u2019s \u00a7 2241 claim must have been squarely foreclosed by prior Circuit precedent at the time of his trial, direct appeal, and first \u00a7 2255 motion. <em>Id. </em>at 1343. However, Williams could not make that showing because, during his direct and collateral attacks, no Circuit precedent squarely held that burglary of a dwelling under \u00a7 810.02 was a violent felony under the ACCA. <em>Id. </em>at 1344-45. Thus, \u201cit was an open question\u201d whether \u00a7 810.02 would categorically constitute a violent felony under the ACCA. <em>Id. </em>at 1345.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-10\">We recently reaffirmed <em>Williams, </em>and held that, to show that a prior \u00a7 2255 motion was inadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his detention, a petitioner must demonstrate, <em>inter alia, </em>that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A1p\">throughout his sentencing, direct appeal, and first \u00a7 2255 proceeding, our Circuit\u2019s binding precedent had <em>specifically addressed his distinct prior conviction </em>that triggered \u00a7 924(e) and squarely foreclosed the \u00a7 924(e) claim that he was erroneously sentenced above the 10-year statutory maximum penalty in \u00a7 924(a).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b467-11\"><em>Mackey v. Warden, </em>739 F.3d 657, 661 (11th Cir.2014) (emphasis added); <em>see also Bryant, </em>738 F.3d at 1274.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-12\">Chaplin cannot demonstrate, that \u00a7 2255 was an inadequate or ineffective remedy because he cannot show that an escape conviction under Fla. Stat. \u00a7 944.40<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> was a violent felony under the ACCA during his trial and sentencing in 2003, direct appeal in 2004, and \u00a7 2255 motion in 2005. <em>See Mackey, </em>739 F.3d at 661; <em>see also Bryant, </em>738 F.3d at 1274.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> This Court held in 2001 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>that an escape conviction constituted a crime of violence for purposes of the career offender criteria of the Sentencing Guidelines. <em>United States v. Gay, </em>251 F.3d 950, 954 (11th Cir.2001). However, that case did not \u201csquarely foreclose\u201d Chaplin\u2019s argument, because <em>Gay </em>involved the career offender criteria rather than the ACCA, and analyzed a Georgia escape statute rather than the Florida statute at issue in Chaplin\u2019s case. <em>See id. </em>at 952 (analyzing Gay\u2019s escape conviction under O.C.G.A. \u00a7 16-10-52); <em>see also Mackey, </em>739 F.3d at 661 (holding the binding precedent must have \u201cspecifically addressed his distinct prior conviction\u201d). As in <em>Williams, </em>it was an open question during Chaplin\u2019s sentencing, direct appeal, and \u00a7 2255 motion whether an escape conviction under Fla. Stat. \u00a7 944.40 constituted a violent felony under the ACCA. <em>See Williams, </em>713 F.3d at 1345. Thus, because no case from this Court squarely foreclosed Chaplin\u2019s claim so as to render \u00a7 2255 an inadequate or ineffective remedy, \u201cthere was no circuit precedent for <em>Begay </em>to bust.\u201d <em>See id. </em>at 1347 (\u201c[A]t the time of Williams\u2019s first \u00a7 2255 motion, there was no circuit precedent for <em>Begay </em>to bust.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b468-4\">Accordingly, Chaplin is unable to demonstrate the remedy provided under \u00a7 2255 is \u201cinadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his detention.\u201d <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(e). Thus, the district court had no jurisdiction to consider the merits of Chaplin\u2019s \u00a7 2241 petition. <em>See Williams, </em>713 F.3d at 1337 (explaining if we determine at any time that we lack subject matter jurisdiction, we must dismiss the action). We vacate the district court\u2019s denial of Chaplin\u2019s \u00a7 2241 petition, and remand for the district court to dismiss the petition for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-6\">VACATED AND REMANDED WITH INSTRUCTIONS.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b467-7\">. The version of Florida\u2019s escape statute in effect in 1987, when Chaplin was convicted, provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b467-8\">Any prisoner confined in any prison, jail, road camp, or other penal institution, state, county, or municipal, working upon the public roads, or being transported to or from a place of confinement who escapes or attempts to escape from such confinement shall be guilty of a felony of the second degree.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b467-14\">Fla.

To the extent Chaplin argues he was \"actually innocent\u201d of the sentencing enhancement, we have expressly rejected such a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>claim. <em>See Williams, </em>713 F.3d at 1345-46 (holding actual innocence refers only to factual innocence of crimes, and a sentencing challenge regarding predicate ACCA offenses constitutes a claim of legal innocence).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
