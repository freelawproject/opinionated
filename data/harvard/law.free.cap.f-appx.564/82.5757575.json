As he did below, Mitchell challenges the district court\u2019s assignment of a strike for the dismissal as frivolous of the complaint in <em>Jackson v. Garner, </em>No. 96-cv-130 (E.D.Tex. Oct. 9, 1996). Mitchell asserts that he was not a plaintiff in that ease.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-5\">The district court\u2019s docket sheet in <em>Jackson </em>confirms that Mitchell was in fact one of the prisoner-plaintiffs and, more specifically, that his complaint was dismissed as frivolous. The district court thus properly concluded that the dismissal counted as a strike for purposes of \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 387 (5th Cir.1996). The strikes assigned to Mitchell based on the dismissal of a prior state-court civil lawsuit, however, should not have counted. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 451, 1915(g). Accordingly, the district court\u2019s judgment is vacated, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-6\">We note that, after filing the instant lawsuit, Mitchell accrued two additional strikes for the district court\u2019s dismissal of his \u00a7 1983 lawsuit and our dismissal of his appeal as frivolous in <em>Mitchell v. Henderson, </em>No. 13-20262, 2013 WL 6659745 (5th Cir. Dec. 18, 2013) (unpublished). <em>See Adepegba, </em>103 F.3d at 387. Although he had not accumulated three strikes at the time that he filed the instant suit, Mitchell has now done so. Consequently, Mitchell is warned that he will be barred from proceeding in forma pauperis in any future civil actions filed while he is incarcerated, absent a showing that he is in imminent danger of serious physical injury. \u00a7 1915(g). Mitchell is also cautioned that any future frivolous or repetitive filings in this court or any court subject to our jurisdiction will subject him to additional sanctions, as will his failure to withdraw any pending matters that are frivolous, repetitive, or otherwise abusive.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-9\">VACATED AND REMANDED; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED; 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g) BAR IMPOSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b110-6\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
