Upon consideration, and in the light of the very able arguments and brief submitted, we are of opinion that the said will, protocol, and documents were properly admitted in evidence, and that their effect, sustained, as they were, by proof of corroborating facts and circumstances, is to show that the plaintiffs below, plaintiffs in error here, as the heirs and descendants of Gabriel Rivas, have no right to recover the lands in controversy. The direction to the jury to find for the defendants was correct, and the judgment of the Circuit Court is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
