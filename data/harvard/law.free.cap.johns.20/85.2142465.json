Immediately following the description of the premises in the deed, were these words: \u201c It is understood, that the parties of the first part reserve to themselves the use of the premises during their natural lives.\u201d The deed contained a covenant of warranty, in the usual form. <em>Joseph TV., </em>the grantee, at the time of the execution of the deed, was the infant son of the grantors, being then about 15 years of age. The defendant, then, gave in evidence a deed for the premises in question, dated <em>March </em>6,1817, from <em>Joseph Wood </em>and his wife, to him. A verdict was taken for the plaintiff, subject to the opinion of the Court, as to the operation of the deed from <em>James Wood, </em>the elder, and Ms wife, to <em>Joseph Wood.</em></summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b91-6\"><em>Kirkland, </em>for the plaintiff,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Aoi\">contended, 1. That the deed from <em>James Wood </em>and his wife, to their son, <em>Joseph Wood, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>was for a freehold to commence <em>in futuro, </em>and, therefore, void. 2. That if the deed was not void, it must be construed according to the plain intent of the parties, as expressed in the deed; and <em>that the lessor, Jerusha Wood, </em>who had survived, had a life estate in the premises. <em>(Plowd. </em>300. <em>Cruise\u2019s Dig. </em>32. ch. 12. s. 6\u201413. 2 <em>Wils. </em>75. 1 <em>Johns.

Spencer, </em>contra.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AqLS\">The clause in the deed, reserving the use of the premises for the lives of the grantors, is not a <em>reservation, </em>which is defined by <em>Coke (Co. Litt. </em>47. <em>a.) </em>to be \u201c always of a thing not <em>in esse, </em>but newly created or reserved out of the land or tenement demised.\u201d Here was no rent, service, or estate, newly created. An <em>exception </em>is always a part of the thing granted, and of a thing <em>in esse. </em>If any thing, this was an exception j and if so, it is void, as being repugnant and uncertain. <em>Shepherd, </em>in his <em>Touchstone, </em>(p. 78, 79.) mentions the requisites essential t\u00f3 constitute a good exception. It must be part of the thing granted; it must be of such a thing as is severable from the thing granted ; it must be of such' a thing, as the person in whose favour it is made may have it. Now, the wife, in this case, could have no part of the estate as properly belonging to her. After the grant in fee of the whole estate, apart, or residuary part thereof, cannot be reserved. (2 <em>Bl. Com. </em>164. <em>Plowd. </em>152. 3 <em>Bac. Ab. </em>383. tit. <em>Grant. Bac. Ab. </em>tit. <em>Conditions. </em>(L.) <em>Thompson </em>v. <em>Gregory, </em>4 <em>Johns. Rep. </em>81.) Besides, the exception is void for uncertainty. Can the wife of <em>James Wood </em>take, without being a grantee, or named as such ? She executed the deed merely to release her dower, as wife of the grantor. <em>(Hornbeck </em>v. <em>Westbrook, </em>9 <em>Johns. Rep. </em>73. 12 <em>Johns. Rep. </em>199.)</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"A3h\">Spences, Ch. J.</author>\n<p id=\"AuR\">delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"ADqt\">The questions to be decided, are, 1st. Whether the deed from <em>James Wood </em>and <em>Jerusha </em>his wife to <em>Joseph Wood, </em>is void, as conveying a fee to commence <em>in futuro </em>; and, 2d. Whether the reservation to <em>Jerusha Wood </em>of an estate for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>lfe5 is valid and operative ? The consideration expressed in the deed, as between the grantors and the grantee, is 500 dollars 3 and the deed contains the words \" grant, bargain, sell,\u201d fee. 3 and, after describing the premises granted, are these words: \u201c <em>It is understood that the parties of the first part reserve to themselves the use of the premises during their natural lives.\"</em></p>\n<p id=\"b93-3\">It appears that <em>James Wood, </em>the grantor, was solely seised of the premises, his wife having no interest therein, except an inchoate right of dower. The lessors are <em>Jerusha, </em>the widow of <em>James Wood, </em>he having died in possession six years since, and three of the children o\u00ed <em>fimes </em>Wood.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-4\">On the first point, there can be no doubt, that the deed operated as a covenant to stand seised, if the estate of the grantee, <em>Joseph, </em>was to take effect after the deaths of <em>James Wood </em>and his wife. It was expressly decided, in <em>Jackson v. Dunsbagh, </em>(1 <em>Johns. Cas. </em>91.) that a deed of bargain and sale, founded on a pecuniary consideration, to take effect <em>in futuro, </em>was effectual. This principle was again recognised in <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Staats; </em>(11 <em>Johns. Rep. </em>351.) and it is fully explained in 2 <em>Saund. </em>96. n. 1., where the cases are referred to, and in 4 <em>Cruise\u2019s Digest, </em>p. 185\u2014193.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-5\">It has been insisted, that <em>Jerusha Wood </em>took nothing by the deed, in the event of her surviving her husband, on the ground that an exception or reservation in a deed, in favour \u00a9f a third person, who had no title or interest in the land, is inoperative. The position that a reservation or exception in favour of a stranger, is ineffectual, is undoubtedly true. It is founded on the same principle, that upon a bargain and sale, a use cannot be limited to any other person than the bargainee. The deed in question cannot operate by way of an exception, or reservation, in favour of <em>Jerusha </em>Wood. (3 <em>Barnewall &amp; Alderson, </em>p. 66. <em>Co. Lit. 47 a. 4 Cruise, </em>46.) But it has effect and operation as a covenant to stand seised, and is within the principles adopted in <em>Bedell\u2019s </em>case, (7 <em>Co. </em>133.) and in <em>Goodtitle </em>v. <em>Petto, </em>(2 <em>Str. </em>934.) In <em>Bedell\u2019s </em>case, the facts were, that <em>B. </em>was seised, and he and his wife, in consideration of the natural affection and paternal love which he had to his sons, <em>James </em>and Michael, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>and for their better preferment and advancement, covenant\u00bb \"ed to stand seised of the premises conveyed, to the use of himself for life, and, after his decease, to the use of his wife for life <em>j </em>and, after their deaths, of one moiety to the use of one son, and of the other moiety to the use of the other son, in tail. The question was, whether any use arose to the wife, or not; and it was resolved, that if a man covenant to stand seised to the use of his wife, son, or cousin, it shall raise a use, without any express words of consideration ; and, upon writ of error, the judgment was affirmed by all the Judges of the Common Pleas, and Barons of the Exchequer. The case of <em>Goodtitle </em>v. <em>Petto </em>was adjudged on the same principle. Again; in <em>Paget\u2019s </em>case, (1 <em>Co. Rep. </em>154 <em>a.) </em>it was decided, that upon a covenant to stand seised, a use will arise to those who are within the consideration, though no use will arise to those who are strangers to it. It is scarcely necessary to observe, that in such a conveyance no technical words are required $ such as that the grantor covenants to stand seised, to the use of <em>Jl., </em>&amp;c.; but any other words will create a covenant to stand seised, if it appears to have been the intention of the party to use them for that purpose. <em>(Willes\u2019 Rep. </em>676.) That it was the intention of <em>James Wood, </em>in the deed to which he and his wife were parties, to make provision for her in case she survived him, by securing to her the enjoyment of the premises during her life, is unquestionable. The deed, then, though-it is a valid one, will not take effect until after the death of <em>Jerusha Wood; </em>and the plaintiff is, therefore, entitled to recover on that demise.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-6\">Judgment for the plaintiff.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
