It was admitted, that the rule for judgment was duly entered, and the judgment-roll regularly signed before the <em>ca. sa. </em>issued; but the record was not filed until afterwards, though before notice of the present motion.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b313-9\"><em>C.

The <em>seventh </em>section of that statute declares, (1 <em>N.R.L. </em>500. sess. 36. ch. 50.) That where any debt shall be recovered, &amp;c. it shall be lawful for the party in whose favour such judgment shall be given, to have an execution against the body, or the goods and chattels, lands and tenements, &amp;c. By the <em>second </em>section of the same act, the Judge or officer <em>signing </em>any judgment, is required to set down the day and year of his signing upon the margin of the roll or record where the same judgment shall be <em>entered; </em>and the clerks of the Courts are required to mark on the back of every roll or judgment <em>filed, </em>the time <em>o\u00ed filing </em>the same; and no judgment shall affect any lands, &amp;c. but from the time of the actual filing of the roll or record of the judgments in their respective offices, after the same sh\u00e1ll have been <em>signed </em>as aforesaid. Now, the judgment is perfect as soon as the judgment-roll is signed by the Judge or officer, in the manner prescribed by the act, so as to authorize the issuing of an execution against the <em>body </em>of the debtor; though his lands cannot be affected until the judgment is actually <em>filed or </em>docketted. It is expressly laid down in the <em>English </em>books' of practice, that an execution may issue as soon as judgment is <em>signed. (Tidd\u2019s Pr. </em>909. <em>Gilb. C. P. </em>24. <em>Law of Executions, </em>43. <em>Sheridan\u2019s Pr. </em>299. <em>Barnes\u2019 </em>notes, 197.) <em>Tidd (Pr. </em>843.) says, \u201c the taxing of costs upon <em>a postea, </em>is considered as signing final judgment, after which execution may be immediately taken out against the defendant\u2019s person or goods ; but in order to charge him in execution, or bind his lands, &amp;cc. or if a writ of error be brought, it is necessary that the judgment should be <em>entered </em>of record, and docketted, and the judgment-roll carried to, and filed in the treasury of the Court.\u201d (1 <em>Crompton\u2019s Pr. </em>336. 1 <em>Sellon\u2019s Pr. </em>530, 531.) The <em>charging in execution </em>mentioned by <em>Tidd, </em>is a very different thing from issuing a <em>ca. sa. </em>To charge a defendant in execution, according to the <em>English </em>practice, a <em>committitur </em>must be entered on the roll; and to authorize the entry of such <em>committitur, </em>on record, a com<em>mittitur-piece </em>must be filed with the clerk. (3 <em>Burr. Rep. </em>1841. 1 <em>Crompt. Pr. </em>377.)</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b315-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>Spencer, Ch. J.</author>\n<p id=\"AIpQ\">It has been the established and invariable practice of this Court, for more than thirty years, to require the judgment-roll to be filed with the clerk, before issuing execution. It is, therefore, unnecessary to take notice of the practice of the <em>English </em>Courts. The motion to set aside the execution ought to be granted, on the defendant\u2019s stipulating not to bring an action for false imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-4\"><em>Per totam </em>Curiam.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-9\">Rule accordingly.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
