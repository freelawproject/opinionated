The defendant then read \u2122 evidence an exemplification of the proceedings under the late bankrupt law of the <em>United States, </em>against <em>John </em>Pin<em>tard, </em>(the lessor,) as a bankrupt; by which it appeared, that ^e commission was issued in <em>July, </em>1800, and that the bankrupt executed an assignment, pursuant to the statute, dated <em>* </em>\u00b0 r ... <em>May </em>29, 1807, \u201c of all the estate, right, title, mterest, use, trust, property and possession, benefit and equity of redempt;on cjajm an&lt;j demand whatsoever, which the said <em>J. P. </em>had, at the time of his becoming a bankrupt, in trust for all ^-g cre\u00bfjtors.\u201d The defendant, also, gave in evidence a release, dated <em>May </em>30, 1807, from the assignees of <em>P., </em>the bankrupt, to <em>James A. Stewart </em>and <em>John A. Wells, </em>of all the lands of <em>P., </em>the bankrupt, in the counties of <em>Ulster </em>and <em>Orange, </em>in the state of <em>New-Yorh, </em>for the consideration of 750 dollars. The plaintiff\u2019s counsel objected to the evi- * dence o\u00ed this release, on account of the generality and vagueness of the description of the lands released; but the dudSe reserved all questions of law. The defendant\u2019s counsel insisted, that he had shown a title out of the lessors \u00b0f the plaintiff. The counsel for the plaintiff then read in ev*dence an exemplification of the examination of Pintar\u00e1, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>before the commissioners of bankrupt, in <em>August, </em>1800; in which he declared, among other things, that he had been discharged under the insolvent law of the state of <em>New-Jersey, </em>on the <em>22d </em>of <em>May, </em>1798, and had assigned and delivered up all his estate, real and personal, to <em>Elias </em>Dayton, <em>John N. Cummings, </em>and <em>Jesse Baldwin, </em>his assignees, and that, at the time of his examination, he had no estate or effects whatever ; and that the schedules, attached to his examination, contained true accounts of all his debts and effects, as exhibited when he so obtained his discharge under the insolvent act of <em>New-Jersey; </em>by which schedules, it appeared, that <em>Pintard </em>claimed and assigned about four thousand acres of land in the patent of <em>Minisinh. </em>The plaintiff\u2019s counsel then produced in evidence, an exemplification of the proceedings of the Court of Common Pleas of <em>Essex </em>county, in the state of <em>New-Jersey, </em>in the case of <em>John Pintard, </em>an insolvent debtor, and an assignment of all his estate, real and personal, by him, to the said <em>Dayton, Cummings </em>and <em>Baldwin, </em>made pursuant to the law of that state, dated <em>May 22d, </em>1798, in <em>trust, </em>to and for the use and benefit of all the creditors of the said <em>Pintard.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b191-6\">The defendant then gave in evidence an exemplification of certificate of the clerk of the county of <em>Essex, </em>in <em>New-Jersey, </em>authenticated in the manner required by the act of Congress, that he had searched, and found no oath or affidavit of the said <em>Dayton, Cummings </em>and Baldwin, the assignees of <em>Pintard, </em>on the files or records of the said Court. It was proved, that a short time before the trial of the cause, <em>Cummings, </em>one of the assignees of <em>P. </em>under the insolvent act of <em>New-Jersey, </em>declared, that the trustees had never qualified, and that he had nothing to do with the trust or property ; that <em>Baldwin, </em>another of the assignees, was present at the time the declaration was made by \u20ach and said nothing of the oath, but refused to execute any release to <em>J. A. Stewart; </em>and it appeared that <em>Dayton </em>was dead. It was also proved, that in <em>July, </em>1816, <em>Cummings, </em>on being applied to for a release for some of the lots in the <em>Minisinh </em>patent, said that he never had qualified as a trustee, and never intended to act under the assignment of Pintard.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"A-\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>A verdict was taken for the plaintiff, subject to the oph \u2122\u00b0n ^le Court, on a case, containing the facts as above stated; and all questions of law and evidence at the trial were reserved.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b192-4\"><em>Betts, </em>for the plaintiff,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AZ\">contended, that the plaintiff had proved a title under <em>Pintar\u00e1, </em>and his assignees, under the insolvent law of <em>New-Jersey. </em>The defendant had attempted to show a title out of the lessors, in purchasers under a deed from the assignees of <em>P. </em>as a bankrupt, in 1807, seven years after the bankrupt obtained a certificate of discharge, and which did not describe any property specifically. Such a general assignment by the commissioners of a bankrupt will not pass a particular estate in land. The property must be particularly described. The 11th, 12th, and 17th sections of the act show that the commissioners must <em>specify </em>the real estate which they intend to convey or assign : so that, even if the commissioners had power, in 1807, to make a conveyance, he contended, that it has not been well executed. But the bankrupt law of the <em>U. S. </em>was limited to five years, and expired in 1805, and after that term these commissioners had no power to convey.</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b192-5\">Again; the commissioners of bankrupt were apprized of the assignment by <em>Pintar\u00e1, </em>the bankrupt, previously made to the trustees, under the insolvent law of <em>New-Jersey. </em>The law will presume a delivery of ,the deed to the trustees, and an acceptance by them of the trust, until the contrary appears. Those assignees are the real lessors in this suit.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b192-6\"><em>Billings </em>and <em>D. B. Og\u00e1en, </em>contra,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AUU\">insisted, that by the bankrupt act of the <em>\u00dc. S. </em>all the property of the bankrupt was vested in the commissioners. In cases of bankruptcy or insolvency, the assignments are always general; and such a general description of land in a deed is sufficient. (Jackson, ex dem. <em>Livingston, </em>v. <em>De Lancey, </em>11 Johns. <em>Rep. </em>365.) The bankrupt law contained a saving of all proceedings under commissions actually issued at the time the act expired; and the commission in-the case of <em>Pintar\u00e1 </em>had issued before that time.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b192-8\">Again; the assignees of <em>P. </em>under the insolvent law of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number><em>Mew-Jersey, </em>never took the oaths required of them by that law; and until they had qualified, they could not act as trustees : and it is proved that though above twenty years have elapsed, nothing has, in fact, been done by those trustees. Besides, the trustees, by virtue of the insolvent law of Mew-Jersey, can claim nothing in this state, under the assignment to them, for the benefit of the insolvent\u2019s creditors there. A record of proceedings under an act of the legislature of <em>Mew-Jersey, </em>cannot pass land in this state. But admitting that the. assignment was regular and duly executed, there is no evidence of its delivery or of its acceptance by the grantees. A deed, in order to pass land, must be executed and delivered according to the forms required by the laws of the state in which the land is situated.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b193-6\">Spencer, Ch, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AmL\">delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-7\">The plaintiff\u2019s right to recover depends entirely on the effect of the discharge to <em>John Pintar\u00e1, </em>and the assignment made to <em>Cummings </em>and <em>Baldwin, </em>under the insolvent proceedings in <em>Mew-Jersey ; </em>for it does not admit of a doubt, that the assignment, under the bankrupt act, by the commissioners of bankruptcy, to <em>Moore </em>and <em>Farquhar, </em>the assignees of <em>Pintar\u00e1, </em>passed all the estate and interest of <em>Pintar\u00e1 </em>in the premises. The act repealing the bankrupt act, contained savings and provisos in favour of such cases as were then pending ; and this case was then pending.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-8\">The question is, whether, under the facts proved in this case, the <em>Mew-Jersey </em>assignees can, now, for the first time, after the lapse of more than twenty years, assent to the trust, and take under a deed, when, during all that period, they have never acted, nor accepted the trust conferred on them by the assignment of the 22d of <em>May, </em>1798 ? I am of opinion that they cannot. It is necessary to the validity of a deed, that there he a grantee willing to accept it. It is a contract, a parting with property by the grantor, and an acceptance thereof by the grantee. An acceptance will be presumed, from the beneficial nature of the transaction, where the grant is not absolute. The presumption is not so strong, that the grantee accepts the deed, where he derives no benefit under it, but is subjected to a duty, or the per<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>formance of a mere trust. The non-existence of any oath# on the part of the assignees, to execute the trust, and the lapse of so many years, without having executed it, coupled with the declarations of one of the two surviving trustees, in the presence of the other, without any dissent on his part, that they had nothing to do with the trust, that they had never qualified, had no concern with the property, and never intended to act, make out the fact, that they never agreed to accept the trust, and, consequently, never assented to the deed. In <em>Jackson, </em>ex dem. <em>M\u2018Crea, </em>v. <em>Dunlap, </em>(1 <em>Johns. Cas. </em>114.) and in <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Phipps, </em>(12 <em>Johns. Rep. </em>422.) the principle is distinctly advanced, that it is essential to the legal operation of a deed, that the grantee assent to receive it, and that there could be no delivery without an acceptance.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-4\">Without examining the other points in the case, this is decisive against the plaintitf\u2019s right of recovery.</p>\n<p id=\"AY5\">Judgment for the defendant..</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
