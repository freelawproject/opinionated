Pell, </em>as if his wife had not been made defendant. The action was debt on a bond executed by the defendants, <em>jointly, </em>to <em>Elizabeth Pugsley, </em>the testatrix; and the plaintiff declared against them as joint obligors. The defendant served a demurrer to the declaration, (which had been filed <em>de lene esse,) </em>assigning, as a special cause, that the action was brought against the husband and wife, jointly, when it ought <em>to </em>have been against the husband alone. But the plaintiff\u2019s attorney returned the demurrer, because no special bail had been filed in the cause.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b132-8\"><em>SUliman, </em>contra,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AK0\">objected, that where a wife is made a party, the plaintiff cannot enter a <em>nolle prosequi; </em>but must discontinue, and commence a new action against the husband alone.
