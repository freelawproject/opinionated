Levy, </em>a merchant, resident at <em>g^ Thomas, </em>but then in the city of <em>New-York, </em>about the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>plaintiff\u2019s loading two vessels at <em>New-YorJc, </em>on his own account, and delivering their cargoes at <em>Havanna, Laguira, </em>or <em>Porto Cabello, </em>to be paid for by <em>Levy, </em>on their delivery. This negotiation resulted in an agreement, the terms of which were contained in two letters, each bearing date the 21st <em>July, </em>1818. The first letter was from <em>Levy </em>to the plaintiff, as follows : \u201cI am desirous of purchasing of you, deliverable in <em>Havanna, Laguira, </em>or <em>Porto Cabello, </em>a certain quantity of beef, pork, flour, peas, &amp;tc. and will contract with you, on the following terms ; for a cargo of beef, &lt;kc. to be shipped by the brig <em>Warrior, </em>and a cargo of flour, to be shipped by the brig <em>George Washington, </em>to <em>Havanna </em>or <em>Laguira, I </em>will pay you <em>the </em>amount of the costs and charges, including the cost of insurance which you shall pay thereon, and five per cent, advance on the amount of invoice, for your profit, together with one dollar per barrel, freight, if delivered at <em>Havanna, </em>or two dollars and fifty cents per barrel, if delivered at <em>Laguira </em>or <em>Porto </em>Cabello.\u201d The answer of the plaintiff to this letter, was as follows : <em>\u201c </em>I have received your letter, and I agree to your proposal to deliver you the cargoes of the <em>Warrior </em>and the <em>George Washington, </em>at <em>Havanna, </em>or a port to windward, at the cost and charges, as paid, and five per cent, advance on amount of invoice, together with one dollar per barrel, freight; and in case that one or both should go to <em>Laguira or Porto Cabello, </em>an additional freight of one dollar and fifty cents per barrel; fifteen running days to be allowed for discharging the cargoes at <em>Havanna, </em>and twenty-five running days for all ports if they proceed to windward.\u201d It appeared that <em>Levy </em>had made a contract with the intendant utHavanna, to supply the government at <em>Havanna, Laguira, </em>and <em>Porto Cabello, </em>with provisions like those of the cargo of the <em>George Washington </em>; and for that purpose, he came to the <em>United States, </em>and made, among others, the contract with the plaintiff; but <em>Levy </em>did not communicate to the plaintiff, nor did the plaintiff know of the contract between him and the intendant of <em>H. </em>The <em>George Washington, </em>of which the plaintiff owned two thirds, and <em>Noah Pratt </em>the other third, was laden with a cargo of flour and pork, and the master, on the 5th of August, 1818, signed bills of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>lading, stating that the plaintiff had shipped, 8zc. the flour and pork, to be delivered at the port of <em>Havanna, </em>to <em>Hernanclez and Chauviteau, </em>or their assigns, paying no freight, the same being the property of the owner of the vessel. The invoice which accompanied the cargo, stated that it was shipped by the plaintiff, on board the brig <em>George Washington, </em>for <em>Havanna, </em>for account and risk of the shipper, a citizen of the <em>United States, </em>and consigned to Messrs. <em>Hernandez and Chauviteau. </em>It appeared that <em>H. C. </em>were the persons designated by <em>Levy </em>to be the consignees of the cargo at <em>Havanna, </em>and had his instructions relative \u25a0to it, and to whom the cargo was to be delivered at <em>Havanna, </em>or was by them to be ordered to be delivered at <em>Laguira </em>or <em>Porto Cabello. </em>Before the vessel sailed, the plaintiff addressed a letter of instructions to the master, signed by <em>F. G. Bull, </em>his authorized agent for the purpose, in which he directed him to proceed to <em>Havanna, </em>and on his arrival there, address himself to <em>Hernandez and Chauviteau, </em>who would either receive the cargo, or if they thought best for his interest would direct the master to proceed to some other market to windward; and if the brig was discharged at <em>Havanna, </em>he was to advise with <em>H. fy C. </em>as\" to procuring the best freight for <em>Europe </em>or the <em>U. S. </em>&amp;c. The plaintiff, also, wrote a letter to <em>Hernandez and Chauviteau, </em>which was delivered to the master, in which he mentions the shipment to them of the cargo of flour and pork, amounting to 17,853 dollars ; and requesting them to receive and dispose of the same to the best advantage for his account; and that in case they thought it best for his interest, to send the vessel to any other market, that is, to windward, they might do so ; but in that case, they must calculate that the cost of the flour would be augmented one dollar and fifty cents for freight, and eight per cent, for insurance. That the shipment was made by the advice of their mutual friend Mr. <em>Levy, </em>and he hoped that it would prove satisfactory, and come to a good market. That in case the vessel discharged at the <em>Havanna, </em>they were requested to consult with the master, as to procuring a freight for <em>Europe </em>or the <em>U. S. </em>preferring the latter ; and to furnish the master with money sufficient to pay his expenses, and take his bill on the plain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>tiff for the amount. If the vessel discharged at <em>H. </em>and no freight could be procured for the <em>U. S., </em>and a cargo of molasses, or part of a cargo, could be purchased at eight reals per keg, they were requested to make the purchase, after taking what freight could be obtained, drawing on him for the amount; and if no freight could be procured, <em>he </em>was willing to go' as high as nine reals per keg for molasses. These letters were shown to Mr. <em>Levy </em>at the time they were written, and before they were delivered to the master.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b223-4\">The <em>G. W. </em>arrived at <em>Havanna </em>about the 10th of <em>September, </em>1818, where she remained about two days, without delivering any part of her cargo. The letter addressed by the plaintiff to <em>H. fy C. </em>was delivered to them; and they directed the captain to proceed with the vessel and cargo to <em>Laguira. </em>While at <em>Havanna, </em>one of the clerks of <em>Hernandez and Chauviteau, </em>in the presence of Captain <em>Pratt, </em>inserted in the body of the bill of lading, after the words \u201c port of <em>Havanna,\u201d </em>the words \u201c or a marketand the following indorsement was made on the <em>same </em>bill of lading : <em>\u201c </em>Deliver the contents within to Mr. <em>Gerardo Patrullo ; </em>ordered the brig to proceed, not finding a favourable sale of the cargo at <em>Havanna.\u2014Havanna, </em>11th of <em>September, </em>1818. <em>Hernandez and Chauviteau.\u201d </em>Two letters were written at <em>Havanna, </em>by <em>Hernandez and Chauviteau </em>? one addr\u00e9ssed to <em>Gerardo Patrullo, </em>at <em>Laguira, </em>and the other to <em>Jose Beneto de Austria, </em>at <em>Porto Cabello, </em>both dated the 10th of <em>September, </em>1818. A translation of the first letter was as follows : \u201c The <em>American </em>brig <em>George Washington, </em>Captain <em>Noah Pratt, </em>has just arrived here with a cargo of flour and pork, consigned to us by Mr. <em>James Be Wolf, </em>jun.

Has the warranty of <em>American </em>property been complied with in this case <em>t </em>The contract between the plaintiff and Mr. <em>Levy, </em>was a valid contract at common law, and by the law of nations ; most certainly, in a state of peace. But it will be objected, that as war existed between <em>Spain </em>and her colonies, this is to be considered and treated as a contract in time of war. Sir <em>William Scott, </em>in the case of the <em>Packet de Bilboa, </em>(2 <em>Rob. Adm. Rep. </em>133.) admits, that in time of peace, there would be nothing unlawful in the consignor taking upon himself the whole risk of the goods, until delivered to the consignee. But, \u201c in time of war,\u201d he says, \u201c this cannot be permitted, for it would at once put an end to all captures at sea because it would be a contrivance resorted to, for the purpose of protecting property from capture, \u201c in all consignments from neutral ports to the enemy\u2019s country, to the manifest defrauding of all rights of capture.\u201d And because it <em>may </em>be used as an instrument of fraud, he comes to the very illogical conclusion, that it, therefore, is to be considered as an invalid contract in time of war; thus applying a rule of evi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>dence to interpret a contract, in order to render it void, ]\\fay; he puts the doctrine on a more fanciful^ ground; that as the consignee has a right to receive the cargo, the captor\u2019 \u201c having all the rights that belong to his enemy,\u201d has the right to take possession of it, and his possession is equivalent to a delivery to the consignee. If the captor, in succeeding to the <em>rights, </em>succeeded, also, to the <em>duties </em>of the consign\u00e9e, this reasoning might be plausible; bnt when the' payment by the consignee is to depend on the delivery of thes goods to him, it is not easy to perceive how the possession by the captor, who <em>does not pay, </em>is equivalent to a delivery to the consignee. Indeed, the learned Judge is sensible of the fallacy \u00f3f such reasoning, and is obliged to suppose that the consignor has, in his bargain with the consignee, guarded against the <em>loss by capture; </em>or, if he' has not, that <em>\u201c </em>he has acted improvidently, and without caution.\u201d Sir <em>William Scott </em>cites no authority whatever for this doctrine ; and it is, manifestly, not supported by principle. In the first place, it infers the illegality of a contract, from the mere circumstance that it may be fraudulent. To consider a shipment, under such circumstances, as <em>prima facie </em>evidence of a fraud on belligerent rights, would be going far enough; but to .pronounce a contract unlawful, because it may be abused for such a purpose, is unsound. A neutral may put his property, <em>bona fide, </em>on board of a belligerent vessel, or even an armed ship of the enemy, to be carried to the belligerent country; and it is not, therefore, to be. treated as enemy\u2019s property; though this would be liable to great abuse and distrust. <em>(The Nereid, 9 Cranch, </em>388. <em>The Atalanta, </em>3 <em>Wheat. Rep. </em>417.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b226-4\">In the next place, this doctrine is inconsistent with the other and better reasoning of Sir <em>'William Scotf, </em>in the same case; where he says, \u201c The goods are sent at the risk of the shipper. If they had been lost, on whom would the loss have fallen, but on him ? What surer test of property call there be than this ? It is the true criterion of property, that if you are the person on whom the loss will fall, you are to. be considered as the proprietor.\u201d If this be so, \u2022 where a: contract is made in time of peace, there is no authority or principle which will support the position, that such a con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>tract is invalid in time of war. With the exception of blockaded ports, and articles contraband of war, the right of the neutral to make contracts with the belligerents, remains the same as in a state of peace. If his contract to deliver goods to an enemy, is fraudulent, in fact, and not at his own risk, but used as a mere cover to protect the property of a belligerent, it ought to share the fate of belligerent property. If, however, the contract is <em>bona fide, </em>it is an unlawful restraint on the rights of a neutral to pronounce it illegal.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b227-4\">Again: It is said, the property is good prize, because, on -delivery, it would belong to the belligerent, and the captor \u2022succeeds to his rights; that is, the right of receiving. But from whom does the captor receive it <em>? </em>From the neutral. And whose property is it, until the capture ? The neutral\u2019s. Its character can-only be changed by a delivery to the enemy. It is, then, captured as neutral property.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b227-7\">In the case of the <em>Atlas, </em>(3 <em>Rob. Adm. Rep. </em>299, 300. <em>Sally-Griffiths, </em>in the note,) it is again laid down as the doctrine of the Prize Court, that contracts of purchase effected by a belligerent, but the payment contingent, depending on the delivery of the property, which remains at the risk of the neutral, though lawful in peace, are unlawful in war, and if taken <em>in transitu, </em>the property is to be condemned as enemy\u2019s property. Will this Court adopt such a doctrine, and apply it to a contract between two of our own citizens ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b227-9\">In the case of <em>Ludlow </em>v. <em>Bowne and Eddy, </em>(1 <em>Johns. Rep. </em>1.) this Court reviewed the doctrine of the British Prize Court, and refused to adopt it; and the decision in that case has been the law of this state since <em>February, </em>1806. The present Chancellor, though he differed from the other Judges, did not rest his opinion on the doctrine of Sir <em>William </em>Scott; but thought the agreement, in that case, fraudulent in fact.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b227-11\">In the case of the <em>Venus, </em>(8 <em>Cranch, </em>275.) Mr. Justice <em>Washington </em>says, <em>\u201c </em>To effect a change of property, as between seller and buyer, it is essential that there should be a contract of sale agreed upon by both parties j and if the \u2022thing agreed to be sold, is to be sent by the vendor to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>vendee, it is necessary to the perfection of the contract, that jt ghouJd be delivered to the purchaser or to his agent, which the master, to many purposes, is considered to be.\u201d In the case of the <em>Frances, </em>(8 <em>Cranch, </em>418.) he says, \u201cWhen goods are sent upon the account and risk of the shipper, the delivery to the master is a delivery to him as agent of the shipper, not of the consignee.\u201d In the case of the <em>Jose Indiano, </em>(1 <em>Wheat. Rep. </em>208.) Mr. Justice <em>Story </em>says, \u201cIn general, the rules of the Prize Court, as to the vesting of property, are the same with those of the common law, by which the thing sold, <em>after the completion of the contract, </em>is properly at <em>the </em>risk of the purchaser.\u201d But, until the vendor \u201chas done some notorious act to devest himself of his title, or has parted with the possession, by an actual and unconditional delivery, for the use of the vendee, no property in the goods vests in him.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b228-4\">2. Then, was the plaintiff bound to communicate to the defendants the contract under which the cargo was shipped ? It is not necessary to communicate or disclose any things for which the insured undertake by a warranty, express or implied. <em>(Marshall on Ins. </em>475. <em>Shoolbred v. Nutt, </em>S. C. <em>Park, </em>229.) The representation is merged in the warranty. If the defendants, not relying on their warranty, had asked for information, and the plaintiff had communicated what was not true, that might be a ground of defence. The case of <em>Haywood </em>v. <em>Rodgers, </em>(4 <em>East, </em>590.) very strongly illustrates the rule on this subject.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b228-5\">jD. <em>B. Ogden </em>arid <em>S. Jones, </em>contra.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ADcp\">1. The cargo, upon its shipment in <em>New-York, </em>became the property of <em>Levy, </em>by delivery, and was not, therefore, <em>American </em>property. <em>L; </em>was the agent of the <em>Spanish </em>government, and made the purchase, here. A delivery to him, was, in truth, a delivery \u2022 to the <em>Spanish </em>government. He was to bear the costs and charges attending it, and to pay for the insurance ; the cargo was at his risk. The letter of instructions to the captain does not forbid the delivery of the cargo, without payment; nor is he enjoined to demand payment of the purchase money. It is evident, that the contract of sale was consummated here, and that the payment for the cargo was not to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>depend on its delivery at the ports mentioned. In the case of <em>Ludlow </em>v. <em>Bowne and Eddy, </em>the vendee was to give a bill of sale with a <em>guaranty, </em>and until that was done, the goods were not to be delivered. Here, if the goods had never been delivered at <em>Savanna, </em>or <em>Laguira, </em>or <em>Porto Cabello, </em>they must have been regarded as belonging to Mr. <em>Levy.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b229-4\">Again : The vessel arrived at <em>Savanna, </em>and the agent of Mr. <em>Levy </em>altered the bill of lading, directing the delivery at <em>Savanna, or a market, </em>and ordering the master to proceed to <em>Laguira </em>or <em>Porto </em>Cabello; thus exercising complete ownership and control over the property. The master was instructed to deliver the property to the agent of Mr. <em>Levy, </em>not to the agent of the plaintiff. At and from Savanna, then, the property ceased to be <em>American.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b229-5\">The counsel for the plaintiff has criticised the doctrine of the Prize Court, as laid down by Sir <em>William Scott. </em>But it is a doctrine which, on examination, will be found sound and well founded 5 a doctrine, without which, no belligerent could maintain his rights,, or repel the secret attacks of war in disguise. Nothing can be added to the learned, luminous, and cogent reasoning of Sir <em>William Scott </em>on this subject. And this country, whenever it becomes belligerent, will be compelled to adopt it, as indispensable to the maintenance of its rights. In <em>Ludlow </em>v. <em>Bowne and Eddy, </em>the cases cited from the admiralty, were not touched by the Court, but considered as inapplicable to the state of facts presented in that case.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b229-6\">2. Every fact which may vary or enhance the risk, ought to be; disclosed to the insurer. It is enough, that a belligerent Prize Court would have considered this contract, no matter whether rightfully or wrongfully, as affecting the neutrality of the property. If so, it must enhance the risk. The insured is bound to communicate every species of intelligence which he possesses, which may influence the insurer in deciding whether he will insure at all, or what premium he will ask for making the insurance. <em>(Durell </em>v. Bederley, 1 <em>Holt's N. P. Rep. </em>283\u2014287. notes.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b229-7\">Again: The facts in this case show, most clearly, that this was a cover for <em>Spanish </em>property, and that the plaintiff <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>knew that he was covering belligerent property. The letter from the plaintiff to <em>Hernandez and Chauviteau, </em>was false throughout, if Mr. <em>Levy </em>was to be the owner of the cargo on its arrival at <em>Havanna. </em>The fact is, that <em>Levy </em>was an agent, sent out to purchase supplies for the <em>Spanish </em>government, and the plaintiff must be presumed to have known the fact.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b230-4\">3. The property was condemned by a competent Court of Admiralty, for a breach of blockade; and, although the sentences of foreign Courts of Admiralty are not held to be conclusive in the Courts of this state, as to contracts between our own citizens, yet, [Here the counsel was stopped by the <em>Chief </em>Justice, who said, that the doctrine on that subject had been so long and so definitively settled, that it was not, now, to be questioned.]</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b230-5\"><em>T. A. </em>Emmet, in reply,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AfCF\">said, that the case of <em>Ludlow </em>v. <em>Bowne </em>was quite decisive of the present case, .which is, indeed, stronger in favour of the plaintiff. The delivery of the goods was a condition precedent to the payment. They were put on board the plaintiff\u2019s own vessel; and under the care of his own master; they were, therefore, in his own possession, and under his own control. The election to deliver or not, was to be made at <em>Havanna, Laguira, </em>or <em>Porto Cabello.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A_0F\">Again: The treaty between <em>Spain </em>and the <em>United States, </em>declares; that free ships make free goods; and it would naturally be supposed that the <em>Spanish </em>captors would adhere-to that article, until it had been otherwise declared. Even according to the reasoning of Sir <em>William Scott, </em>there can be no fraud, unless the party knew that he was dealing with An enemy, and intended to cover his property. Now, the case states that the plaintiff did not know of the contract between <em>L. </em>and the <em>Spanish </em>government at <em>H. </em>Suppose the \u2022 cargo had been lost by perils of the sea, who would have borne the loss ? Surely, it must have fallen on the plaintiff, or his insurers. The cause or mode ofloss can make no difference in the construction of the warranty. If the property had been warranted <em>neutral, </em>then the Court must have looked to the law of nations, to ascertain what constituted its neutral character. But when the warranty is that it is <em>American </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>property, they must look to the municipal law of our own country, to determine its <em>American </em>character. A warranty is to be construed according to the plain commercial import of the terms, among mercantile men. <em>(Marshall on Insurance, </em>347 <em>a.)</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b231-4\">As to the alleged concealment, the answer is, that it is a matter covered by the warranty. A concealment, to vitiate the policy, must be fraudulent, and the fact of its being fraudulent must be found by a jury. <em>(Duguet </em>v. <em>Rhinelander, </em>1 <em>Caines\u2019 Cases in Error, </em>27. S. C. 2 <em>Johns. Cas. </em>476. <em>Hallet </em>v. <em>Jenks, </em>1 <em>Caines\u2019 Cases in Error, </em>43\u201447.) The jury have not passed upon the fact, and the Court cannot draw the conclusion. But as <em>Levy </em>was a <em>Dane, </em>and his rights precisely the same, in regard to belligerents, as those of the plaintiff, it could not have varied the risk, or the premium, had it been stated that he was the owner. <em>(Le Roy </em>v. <em>The United Insurance Co. </em>7 <em>Johns.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"ATU\">delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-10\">This case gives rise to three questions; 1st. Was the delivery of the cargo at one of the three ports, <em>Havanna, Laguira, </em>or <em>Porto Cabello, </em>at the election of <em>Levy, </em>a condition precedent to the plaintiff\u2019s right to demand payment of the stipulated price, according to the contract; or was the sale consummated here ? 2d. Was the transaction a cover, and did the plaintiff know that the cargo was for the <em>Spanish </em>government? 3d. Was it necessary for the plaintiff to disclose to the defendants the circumstances under which the property was shipped, even if the risk was enhanced ?</p>\n<p id=\"b231-11\">The contract on the part of the plaintiff is to deliver the cargo at one of the designated places; and it 'is perfectly clear that the election at which of the ports <em>Levy </em>would receive it, was in him. This right of election, to receive the cargo at <em>Laguira </em>or <em>Porto Cabello, </em>might be made and signified to the plaintiff at <em>Havanna, </em>and so it was understood by the parties to the contract. The policy speaks the same language. The cargo is insured from <em>JVew- York </em>to <em>Havanna, </em>and at and from thence to <em>Laguira </em>and <em>Porto Cabello, </em>or either of them, at a premium of seven per cent., to return five and a quarter per cent.., if the risk ended at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number><em>Havanna </em>without loss; thus making <em>Havanna </em>a port to which the vessel was to go, at all events, and leaving it op- ' tional with the assured to proceed to one or both of the other ports. The contract is to purchase and sell, <em>deliver-' able </em>in <em>Havanna, Laguira </em>or <em>Porto Cabello. </em>The risk of delivery rests on the vendor, and the purchase is incomplete, unless the cargo be delivered at one of the appointed places, to be elected by the vendee. As an indemnity for the risk to be incurred by the vendor, he wasat liberty to procure . insurance, which, in the event of the delivery, was to constitute part of the price of the cargo, and in the event of a loss, by the perils insured against, the vendor would find his indemnity in the insurance. Until, then, the plaintiff had performed his part of the contract, by delivering the-cargo at one of the designated ports to be elected by <em>Levy, </em>the property never became vested in <em>Levy, </em>and the plaintiff never could recover the price, and consequently it remained the plaintiff\u2019s property. Such a contract, Sir <em>William Scott, </em>in the case of the <em>Packet de Bilboa, (2 Robinson, </em>111.) considered lawful in time of peace, but as illegal in time of war, and as a fraud on the belligerent, because it went to protect property <em>in transitu </em>to the enemy, and as it deprived the belligerent <em>of </em>his right <em>of </em>capture.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-3\">It was urged, on the argument, that the cargo was received by the consignees at the <em>Havanna, </em>and that thenceforth the property ceased to be the plaintiff\u2019s. The vessel merely reported herself there to <em>Hernandez and Chauviteau, </em>to whom she was addressed; she remained there but two days, and never broke bulk; and then, by their directions, as agents to <em>Levy, </em>proceeded to <em>Laguira. </em>Nothing like an acceptance of the cargo at <em>Havanna </em>is perceived in these acts; but, on the contrary, an election not to receive the cargo there. It has also been insisted, that as the cargo was consigned to <em>Hernandez and Chauviteau, </em>and was not to be sold, what they did, and particularly the alteration in the bill of lading, was equivalent to an acceptance. It was shown, most satisfactorily, by the late Ch. J. <em>Thompson, </em>in the case <em>of Ludlow </em>v. <em>Bowne and Eddy, </em>(1 <em>Johns. Rep. </em>1.) that the consignment was open to explanation, whether made to the consignees, on the account and risk of the consignor, or on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>their account and risk. <em>Hernandez and Chauviteau </em>were also the agents of the plaintiff, in the event that they did not, as the agents of <em>Levy, </em>accept the cargo at <em>Havanna; </em>and, as such agents, they had a right, after electing not to accept the cargo there, with the assent of the captain, to alter the bill of lading in the manner they did, without compromitting the rights of either party. It was a necessary and an innocent act.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-4\">We come back to the question, whether the contract between the plaintiff, an <em>American </em>citizen, and <em>Levy, </em>a resident merchant at <em>St. Thomas, </em>was so far unlawful, as to subject the cargo to capture as <em>Spanish </em>property. The case of <em>Ludlow </em>v. <em>Bowne and Eddy </em>decides this case; and it is impossible to distinguish the two cases. In both, the property insured was warranted to be <em>American </em>property. There, the cargo was shipped by the plaintiffs under an agreement with merchants in <em>France, </em>whereby' the plaintiffs were to deliver the goods at <em>St. Vallery, </em>for which they were to be allowed eight per cent, commissions, taking upon themselves all risk, expressly including a premium for sea risks as well as war risks; the consignees to pay freight on the delivei\u2019y, and also for the amount of cargo, in bills on <em>London, </em>guarantied by a commercial house in <em>London. </em>The goods were captured <em>in transitu, </em>by the <em>British, </em>and condemned as <em>French </em>property. This Court decided, that the goods remained the property of the consignors, and that the warranty was complied with. A majority of the Court were of opinion, that the goods remained the property of the plaintiffs, until their delivery at <em>St. Fallery. </em>In that case, we held, that there was a right to withhold the delivery of the goods, until payment had been made according to the contract; and here, by the express stipulation of the parties, the plaintiff can have no right to demand payment, until he has performed the condition precedent,- the delivery of the goods according to the contract; so that, in both cases, there was no change of property.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-5\">The decisions of Sir <em>William Scott, </em>in the Admiralty Court, were then pressed upon our attention; but we regarded them as the result of political expediency, and as evincing a determination in the <em>British </em>councils, to destroy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>all commerce with their enemy, rather than as rules of international law. We adopted the broad and just principle, that a neutral had a right, and was justified by the law of nations, in supplying belligerents, with the sole exception of contraband goods, and going to a blockaded port. How can the existence of a state of war between <em>Spain </em>and her colonies, not then recognised by the rest of the world as independent states, or how can the existence of war between <em>Spain </em>and <em>Venezuela, </em>under any circumstances, affect such a contract, or render it unlawful ? The warranty in the policy, that the property was <em>American, </em>means that it was so by the law of nations. If the contract would be a legal one in time of peace, which Sir <em>William Scott </em>expressly admits, and if the property would be deemed the plaintiff\u2019s, until actual delivery at one of the elected ports, what would vitiate this contract, or make the property the vendee\u2019s before the performance of the condition precedent, according to the law of nations ? Certainly not because there was a war between <em>Spain </em>and <em>Venezuela; </em>for I trust that this country never will permit the great principle, that a neutral may carry on commerce with a belligerent during war, as well as in peace, with the exceptions already mentioned, to be infringed or abandoned. In the case referred to, we meant to dissent from the principles advanced by Sir <em>William Scott, </em>which go to consider all property bound to an enemy\u2019s country as belonging to the enemy, and as exposed rightfully to capture and condemnation. We meant to consider that rule as an arbitrary one, forming no part of the international code, and as entirely destructive of neutral rights. Subsequent reflection has served to strengthen the opinion 1 held in that case ; and it has led to a conviction that the doctrines advanced by that eminent Judge, in the <em>British </em>Admiralty, were the result of power forgetting right, and the offspring of state policy, created for the occasion.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-4\">As to the alleged concealment, or non-disclosure by the plaintiff, that the cargo was intended by <em>Levy </em>for the <em>Spanish </em>government, the case definitively settles the point; for it is admitted by the defendants, that the plaintiff did not know that <em>Levy </em>had contracted with the Intend ant at, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number><em>Havanna </em>to supply the <em>Spanish </em>government with flour ana provisions; and that he did not know that the cargo, on its arrival at its port of final destination, would have been applied by <em>Levy </em>to the performance of his contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-4\">But it is urged, that the facts and circumstances of the contract should have been disclosed, as the risk was materially enhanced. If it be conceded, that those circumstances did enhance the risk, the answer is decisive, that a party need not communicate any thing with respect to a fact, in regard to which there is an express or implied warranty. As to the conclusiveness of the sentence of condemnation, we are not at liberty to question the doctrine on that point, which has been definitively settled in the Court for the Correction of Errors, and has been so long acquiesced in. There must be judgment for the plaintiff, according to the stipulation in the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-8\">Judgment for the plaintiff.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
