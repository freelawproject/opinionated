A less sum may be a satisfaction of damages, but not of a debt <em>in numero ; </em>nor can it be pleaded in bar of an action for a debt. Again, it does not appear that the note, in this ease, was a negotiable note.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b83-12\">Lynch, contra,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AJoL\">cited 5 <em>Term Rep. </em>513. 517. 1 Johns. <em>Rep. </em>37. 2 <em>Johns.

He contended, that by the English authorities, a <em>negotiable </em>note, given for a simple contract debt due, was a \u00abRsch\u00e1rge of such debt. And this Court have recognised the rule, but have added a qualification, that the party must deliver up and cancel the note, if he means to proceed on the original contract. The acceptance of the note is deemed, at least, <em>prima^^cie </em>evidence of a satisfaction; and where it is expressly stf 'agreed, it is payment; and it makes no difference whether it is the note of the defendant, or of a third person. From the description of the notes in the plea, as having been <em>indorsed </em>by the payee, it is necessarily to be inferred that they were negotiable. But if they are not to be deemed negotiable, yet, as <em>Childs, </em>the indorser, would be liable to the indorsee, for the amount, they must be regarded as a satisfaction of the original debt.</p>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b83-16\">The defendant was not bound, in his plea, to aver payment of the notes. Whether they have been negotiated and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>paid, must be known to the plaintiffs. Again, it being aves\u00bb red that die notes were given and accepted in full satisfaction and discharge, it will be intended that they were for the full amount of the plaintiffs\u2019 demand. But if the amount of the notes were less than the original demand, the additional security by the indorsement of Childs, is a sufficient consideration for the discharge of the balance ; and it would be a fraud on <em>Childs, </em>if the plaintiffs were permitted to recover the balance of the defendants. (2 <em>Camp. N. P. Rep. </em>126. 384. 11 <em>East, </em>390.)</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b84-8\">Platt, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AaU\">delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-9\">The question is, whether the third plea sets out such an <em>accord and satisfaction </em>as will bar the action ?</p>\n<p id=\"b84-10\">The general rule is well settled, that the payment of a less sum of money than the whole debt, <em>without a release, </em>is no satisfaction ofathe plaintiff\u2019s claim. <em>(Cumber </em>v. <em>Warn, </em>1 <em>Stra. </em>426. <em>Harrison </em>v. <em>Wilcox </em>and <em>Close, </em>2 <em>Johns. Rep. </em>449. <em>Fitch v. Sutton, </em>5 <em>East, </em>232. <em>Seymour </em>v. <em>Minturn, </em>17 <em>Johns. Rep. </em>169.) And a mere agreement to accept less than the real debt, would <em>be nudum pactum. (Heathcote </em>v. <em>Crookshanks, </em>2 <em>Term Rep. </em>24.) But, in my judgment, this case is distinguishable from the cases cited. Here was a <em>beneficial interest </em>acquired, and a <em>valuable consideration </em>received by the plaintiffs, when they agreed to accept <em>less </em>than their whole demand. The plea avers that three promissory notes, drawn by the defendant, payable to <em>David W. Childs, </em>and by him indorsed, were delivered to the plaintiffs, and by them accepted and received from the defendant, in full satisfaction and discharge of the promises stated in the declaration. It would be an abuse of terms to call this a mere <em>nudum pactum. </em>Here was <em>inconvenience </em>to the defendant, in procuring a surety ; and also a <em>benefit </em>to the plaintiffs. The defendant held the notes, with Childs' indorsement, and offered them, to secure 2,750 dollars of the debt, if the plaintiffs would relinquish the residue of their claim. It is to be inferred, that <em>Childs </em>lent his indorsement for the sole purpose of effecting this compromise. The plaintiffs accepted the notes as payment of the whole debt; and, I think, good faith and sound principle require that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>this should be deemed a valid accord and satisfaction, to bar the plaintiff\u2019s action. It would operate as a fraud upon <em>Childs, </em>the indorser, whose means of reimbursement from the defendant would be greatly impaired, if this plea be not sustained. If <em>Childs </em>had been the maker, and <em>Hitchcock </em>the mere <em>indorser, </em>the case, as to him, (Childs,) would be widely different; for if <em>Childs, </em>as a real debtor, had made the notes, it would be immaterial to him whether he paid them to <em>Hitchcock </em>or to his indorsees. But independent of the consideration due to the surety, I am of opinion, that if a debtor offers <em>additional security, </em>on condition that his creditor shall give up a portion of the debt, and the creditor accepts such security for a less sum, as a satisfaction for the whole debt, it is a valid discharge, on the ground of accord and satisfaction. <em>(Sheehy </em>v. <em>Mandeville, </em>&amp;c., 6 <em>Cranch, </em>253.)</p>\n<p id=\"b85-5\">In the case of <em>Fitch </em>v. <em>Sutton, </em>(5 <em>East, </em>231.) Lord <em>Ellenborough </em>said, \u201c It is impossible to contend that acceptance of 17 pounds, 10 shillings, is an extinguishment of a debt of 50 pounds. There must be some consideration for the relinquishment of the residue ; something collateral, to show a possibility of benefit to the party relinquishing his further claim; otherwise, the agreement is <em>nudum pactum $ </em>but the mere promise to pay the rest when of ability, put the plaintiff in no better condition than he was before.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b85-6\">In the case of <em>Steinman </em>v. Magnus, (11 <em>East, </em>390.) Lord <em>Ellenborough </em>said, \u201c It is true, that if a creditor simply agree to accept less from his debtor than his just demand, that will not bind him ; but if upon the faith of such an agreement, a third person be lured in to become surety for any part of the debt, on the ground that the party will be thereby discharged of the remainder of his debt, the agreement will be binding.\u201d Here, the plaintiffs have, in fact, \u201c <em>lured </em>in\u201d Mr. Childs. They agreed to purchase his indorsement, and the price to be paid for it was the portion of the debt which they agreed to relinquish to <em>Hitchcock; </em>and why shall they not pay the price, as well as enjoy the benefit of that contract ?</p>\n<p id=\"b85-8\">I am of opinion that the defendant is entitled to judgment on the demurrer.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-9\">Judgment for the defendant.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
