W\u00e9 do not reject but fully accept the general principle that a platform principal owes no general duty to an independent contractor\u2019s employees to correct a hazard on the platform which was created by the contractor. We are simply unwilling to say, without the benefit of a full development of the facts and with no consideration of the argument by the trial court, that here Chevron owed no duty or, of course, that any such duty has not been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>breached. The trial court did not decide whether Chevron owed a duty. Nor do we now. We vacated and remanded so that the trial court may determine whether, under the facts of this ease, Chevron owed plaintiff a duty, separate from vicarious liability, after affording counsel an opportunity to develop all the facts and to make their argument, by further summary proceedings, or trial, as the district court may decide.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-4\">JONES, J., dissents from the denial of rehearing.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
