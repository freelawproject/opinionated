We reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-26\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b613-27\">Hecker filed suit in Texas state court complaining that on July 8, 1991, Wal-Mart\u2019s negligence caused her to slip and fall in the Wal-Mart store and suffer personal injuries. Hecker mailed her complaint to the state court clerk\u2019s office on or about July 1, 1993. On July 7, the clerk\u2019s office informed her that the check enclosed for the filing fee was insufficient and that an additional $20 was required. On July 9, one day after the applicable two-year statute of limitations had run, the clerk\u2019s office received the additional amount and marked the complaint filed. About a month later, Wal-Mart removed the case to federal court and moved to dismiss it as time-barred. The district court granted the motion. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-28\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b613-29\">It is undisputed that the applicable Texas statute of limitations required that Hecker <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>file her personal injury suit with the state clerk by July 8, 1993. V.T.C.A. Civ.Prac. &amp; Rem.Code \u00a7 16.003 (person must bring personal injury claim not later than two years after the day the cause of action accrues); Texas Rules Civ.Proc., Rule 22 (suit is commenced by filing petition in the office of the clerk). The question before us is whether tendering documents without the proper filing fees constitutes filing. Texas case law provides a clear answer.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-4\">The longstanding rule in Texas is that \u201can instrument is deemed in law filed at the time it is left with the clerk, regardless of whether or not a file mark is placed on the instrument and regardless of whether the file mark gives some other date of filing.\u201d <em>Standard Fire Ins. Co. v. LaCoke, </em>585 S.W.2d 678, 680 (1979); <em>see also Arndt v. Arndt, </em>709 S.W.2d 281, 282 (Tex.App. \u2014 Houston [14th Dist.] 1986, no writ) (per curiam). Furthermore, an instrument is deemed filed even if it is tendered without the appropriate filing fee. <em>Arndt, </em>709 S.W.2d at 282 (examining language in statute governing filing fees and holding that paying fees is not a condition precedent to filing); <em>see also Port Distrib. Corp. v. Fritz Chem. Co., </em>775 S.W.2d 669, 670 (Tex.App. \u2014 Dallas 1989, writ dism\u2019d by agr.) (noting that clerk\u2019s refusal to file-stamp a document because filing fee was not attached was improper). In light of this clear precedent, we must conclude that Hecker\u2019s suit was filed when received by the clerk and thus timely.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b614-6\">The district court\u2019s dismissal of Hecker\u2019s complaint is REVERSED and this matter is REMANDED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
