J.,</author>\n<p id=\"ApS\">delivered the opinion of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-10\">Pursuant to Code, \u00a7 58-1145, United Givers Fund of Richmond, Henrico and Chesterfield, Inc., hereinafter called UGF, filed an application in the court below praying that the land and building owned by it at 2501 Monument avenue, in the city of Richmond, and known as the Branch Memorial House, be declared exempt from real estate taxes assessed against it by the city for the years 1960 and 1961, and that the taxes paid by it for these years be refunded. The application was amended to include taxes for the years 1962 and 1963. The applicant alleged that the property is exempt from taxation pursuant to the provisions of \u00a7 183 (f) of the Constitution of Virginia and Code, \u00a7 58-12. The city resisted the application. After hearing the evidence the lower court entered an order holding the property exempt from taxation and directing the refund of the taxes paid. We granted the city a writ of error. The sole issue is whether the property is exempt from taxation under these constitutional and statutory provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-11\">UGF is a nonstock, nonprofit corporation organized under the laws of this State entirely for charitable purposes. Like other community chest organizations, it conducts annual campaigns to raise money for distribution to and through its various agencies. Such contributions and other gifts are its only source of income.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>UGF has two classes of membership, \u201cinstitutional\u201d and \u201ccontributing.\u201d The forty-two welfare agencies which receive funds from UGF and distribute them are known as \u201cinstitutional members.\u201d \u25a0Persons who contribute funds to UGF are known as \u201ccontributing members\u201d who elect a board of governors. This board determines the eligibility of the institutional members or agencies to receive money from UGF. The funds received by these welfare agencies are distributed by them for charitable purposes throughout the year.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-4\">The operations of UGF are under the direction of an executive director and secretary, assisted by a corps of clerks and employees. The salaries of these and the other operational expenses are paid out of the funds collected from contributors.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-5\">From 1954 to 1959 the Branch Memorial House, owned by Mrs. Zayde Branch Rennolds, had been used by Richmond Area Community Chest, the predecessor of UGF, as its headquarters. For this use the Community Chest paid a nominal rental equivalent to the amount of taxes assessed against the property. By a series of annual deeds, the first of which was dated December 1, 1954 and the last on December 1, 1959, Mrs. Rennolds conveyed the property to the Community Chest. Upon the advice of the City Attorney, the property was assessed for real estate taxes for the years 1960, 1961, 1962 and 1963. The annual taxes amount to $1,422.41.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-6\">The Branch Memorial House, originally designed for and used as a residence, has three floors and a basement. The executive director and other employees of UGF have their offices there. Other rooms are used for meetings of the board, numerous meetings of various committees, and for conferences incidental to the work of UGF and its forty-two agencies. The building is used as the headquarters during annual campaigns for the solicitation of contributions. From five to six thousand individuals take part in these campaigns and numerous meetings are held there in connection with such' campaigns.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-7\">In addition to such use by the UGF, its members, agencies and employees, any \u201cnonprofit\u201d or \u201cnonpolitical\u201d organization is permitted to use the meeting rooms. During the year 1961, twenty-two such organizations were permitted to hold meetings in the building or make use of portions thereof. Among such permitted users were a summer theater, the Richmond Dental Society, United States Coast Guard, and Virginia Motor Sports Club. For such use these outside agencies paid no rent but only a janitor\u2019s fee for cleaning the rooms. So far as the record shows, no particular room or rooms, or portions of the building, were allotted for the use of any of these agencies. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>Nor was their use limited to any particular time, except in the case of the summer theater which was permitted to use a portion of the building during the months of June and July. No fraternal organizations met there during any of the years in controversy.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-4\">The pertinent portion of \u00a7 183 of the Constitution reads thus:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b527-5\">\u201cUnless otherwise provided in this Constitution, the following property and no other shall be exempt from taxation, State and local, including inheritance taxes:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b527-6\">\u25a0\u00cdF Tt* Tp TT \"\u00cdS *ir Tt* \u2022Jf\" \"Tr \"re1</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b527-7\">\u201c (f) Buildings with the land they actually occupy, and the furniture and furnishings therein, belonging to any benevolent or charitable association and used exclusively for lodge purposes or meeting rooms by such association, together with such additional adjacent land as may be necessary for the convenient use of the buildings for such purposes; # #</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b527-8\">The pertinent portion of Code, \u00a7 58-12, as amended, reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b527-9\">\u201cThe following property shall be exempt from taxation, State and local, including inheritance taxes:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b527-10\">##########</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b527-11\">\u201c(5) * * <em>* </em>property whether real or personal, owned by any community club or associations or its trustees, when said property is used or operated exclusively for general and community purposes and not for profit. (As amended by Acts 1956, ch. 478, p. 693.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b527-12\">\u201c(6) Buildings with the land they actually occupy, and the furniture and furnishings therein, belonging to any benevolent or charitable association and used exclusively for lodge purposes or meeting rooms by such association, together with such additional adjacent land as may be necessary for the convenient use of the buildings for such purposes; * * * .\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b527-13\">It will be observed that the quoted portion of \u00a7 183(f) of the Constitution is identical with that in Code, \u00a7 58-12(6).</p>\n<p id=\"b527-14\">The city advances a number of reasons why it claims that the property is not exempt from taxation under these constitutional and statutory provisions. First, it says that UGF is not a \u201ccharitable association\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 183(f) of the Constitution and Code, \u00a7 58-12(6). The basis of this contention is the testimony of the executive director of UGF that one of its brochures had correctly stated that the organization performed \u201cnot \u2018charities,\u2019 but services.\u201d The implication seems to be that because UGF administers <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>its benevolences indirectly through its agencies and makes no direct gifts or money to, and provides no direct services for, individuals, it is not a charitable organization. We do not agree with this contention. In 84 C. J. S., Taxation, \u00a7 282, p. 543, it is aptly said: \u201cThe word \u2018charitable,\u2019 as used in laws providing for exemption of property used for charitable purposes, should be given a fair and reasonable interpretation, and means intended for charity. So, in order to be charitable, in this sense, an institution must be organized and conducted to perform some service of public good or welfare, * * #</p>\n<p id=\"b528-4\">Webster\u2019s New Collegiate Dictionary defines \u201ccharitable\u201d as, \u201cLiberal in benefactions to the poor; beneficent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b528-5\">No reason has been advanced why these charitable services or gifts may not be made indirectly through agencies. Indeed, it is a matter of common knowledge that many charitable organizations administer their benevolences through agencies.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-6\">The brochure referred to in the testimony of the executive director shows that UGF allocates the funds collected by it to forty-two agencies, including the American Red Cross, Salvation Army, Travelers Aid Society, Children\u2019s Home Society of Virginia, Young Men\u2019s Christian Association, and others, all of which are commonly recognized as charitable organizations. Clearly, we think that in the administration of its benevolences through these agencies, UGF is a charitable association within the meaning of that term as used in the constitutional and statutory provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-7\">Next, the city contends that the exemption of the property of benevolent or charitable associations referred to in \u00a7 183 (f) of the Constitution and Code, \u00a7 58-12(6), applies only to properties of \u201cfraternal orders\u201d and that UGF is not that kind of association. It argues that the restricted use of the property \u201cfor lodge purposes or meeting rooms\u201d shows such a purpose. The ready answer is that other associations than fraternal orders may use their property for the purpose of meeting rooms.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-8\">Again, the city says that at the time the Constitution was being framed in 1902, community chests and united funds were unknown, whereas the debates show an intended purpose to exempt the property of fraternal orders. It is true that during the debates much was said about the exemption of the property of fraternal orders, some of which were mentioned by name. (Debates of the Constitutional Convention, Vol. II, p. 2694 ff.) But it further appears from the debates that the members also had in mind the exemption of the property of other charitable and benevolent associations \u201cnot \u25a0 con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>ducted for profit.\u201d Debates of the Constitutional Convention, Vol. II, pp. 2699, 2700.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-4\">The city further relies upon a dictum in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Trustees Evergreen Burial Park, </em>176 Va. 9, 10 S. E. 2d 495. That case involved the interpretation of \u00a7 183(c) of the Constitution exempting from taxation cemeteries and endowment funds lawfully held for their care. After quoting verbatim paragraph (c) of the section, the opinion identified certain other paragraphs in general language, thus: \u201c(a) Applies to public property, (b) Applies to church property. * * * (f) Applies to property of fraternal orders.\u201d 176 Va. at 11, 10 S.E. 2d at 496.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-5\">What was there said with reference to paragraph (f) was, of course, not necessary to the decision of that case. While paragraph (f) <em>does </em>apply to the property of fraternal orders, as that opinion states, we did not say that its application is limited to such associations. We now hold that it is not so limited.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-6\">The critical issue in the present case is raised by the further contention of the city that the property is not \u201cused exclusively for lodge purposes or meeting rooms\u201d by UGF and its agencies within the meaning of \u00a7 183(f) of the Constitution and Code, \u00a7 58-12(6). Here the argument is that such tax exemption provisions must be strictly construed and that when this is done it will appear that the property is not used exclusively by UGF \u201cfor lodge purposes or meeting rooms,\u201d but mainly as an office building. Moreover, the city argues that many of the meetings held in this building are by organizations \u201ctotally unconnected with UGF.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b529-7\">Contrary to the argument of the city, beginning with <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lynchburg Y.M.C.A., </em>115 Va. 745, 748, 80 S. E. 589, 50 L. R. A. (N.S.) 1197 (1914), we have applied a liberal interpretation to such exemption provisions. See <em>City of Norfolk </em>v. <em>Board of Sup\u2019rs of Nansemond County, </em>168 Va. 606, 192 S. E. 588 (1937); <em>City of Richmond </em>v. <em>Richmond Memorial Hospital, </em>202 Va. 86, 116 S. E. 2d 79 (1960); <em>Memorial Hospital Ass\u2019n of Va. </em>v. <em>County of Wise, </em>203 Va. 303, 124 S. E. 2d 216 (1962); <em>County of Hanover </em>v. <em>Trustees of Randolph-Macon College, </em>203 Va. 613, 616, 125 S. E. 2d 812, 815 (1962); <em>St. Andrew\u2019s Ass\u2019n </em>v. <em>City of Richmond, </em>203 Va. 630, 125 S. E. 2d 864 (1962); <em>Board of Sup\u2019rs of Wythe County </em>v. <em>Medical Group Foundation, Inc., </em>204 Va. 807, 811, 134 S. E. 2d 258, 261 (1964). See also, Horsley, Taxation, 1960-61, Annual Survey of Virginia Law, 47 Virginia Law Review 1311, 1313-16; Horsley, Taxation, 1961-62, Annual Survey of Virginia Law, 48 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>Virginia Law Review 1554, 1561-65; Horsley, Taxation, 1962-63; Annual Survey of Virginia Law, 49 Virginia Law Review 1662-63.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-4\">In <em>City of Richmond </em>v. <em>Richmond Memorial Hospital, supra, </em>we said that the word \u201cexclusively,\u201d as used in such exemption provisions, \u201chas never been considered an absolute term.\u201d 202 Va. at 91, 116 S. E. 2d at 82.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-5\">In 51 Am. Jur., Taxation, \u00a7 601, p. 584, it is said that, \u201cTo come within a provision for the exemption of property used exclusively for charitable purposes, an organization must have charity as its primary, if not sole, object.\u201d This is in accord with our rule. We have pointed out that in determining whether certain property is exempt from taxation under these constitutional and statutory provisions the controlling factor is the dominant purpose in the use of the property. As we said in <em>County of Hanover </em>v. <em>Trustees of Randolph-Macon College, supra, </em>if the use of the property \u201chas direct reference to the purposes for which the institution was created, and tends immediately and directly to promote those purposes, it is then within the exemption provision of the Constitution, * <em>* </em>* .\u201d 203 Va. at 617, 125 S. E. 2d at 815.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-6\">In the case before us the dominant purpose in the use and occupancy of the Branch Memorial House is to promote the charitable work of UGF and its agencies. As the record shows, this organization and its agencies operate through various boards and committees. Numerous meetings are held there during the annual cycle of their operations. A large amount of money is collected from numerous contributors and distributed through forty-two agencies. Obviously this requires considerable clerical work and office space which contribute directly to the purposes for which UGF was organized and is carrying out. Consequently the devotion of a portion of the building for office space and clerical help does not destroy its tax exemption</p>\n<p id=\"b530-7\">The city next contends that the building is not \u201cexclusively used\u201d by UGF because it permits organizations not connected therewith to hold meetings there. This is but another way of saying that such permitted use by outside civic organizations destroys the tax exemption status of the property. We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-8\">As has been said, no rooms or portions of the building are allotted for the use of any of these outside organizations. They pay no rent and UGF derives no income or profit from their use. Their use of the property in no way interferes with, but is merely incidental to, the dominant and primary use by UGF for its benevolent and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>charitable purposes. See <em>Memorial Hospital Ass\u2019n of Va. </em>v. <em>County of Wise, supra, </em>203 Va. at 309, 124 S. E. 2d at 220; <em>County of Hanover </em>v. <em>Trustees of Randolph-Macon College, supra, </em>203 Va. at 617, 125 S. E. 2d at 815; <em>St. Andrew\u2019s Ass\u2019n </em>v. <em>City of Richmond, supra, </em>203 Va. at 637, 125 S. E. 2d at 869; <em>Board of Sup\u2019rs of Wythe County </em>v. <em>Medical Group Foundation, Inc., supra, </em>204 Va. at 813, 134 S. E. 2d at 262.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-4\">In the oral argument before us it was suggested on behalf of the city that because of the use of the building partly by UGF and its agencies and partly by organizations not connected therewith, the case should be remanded with direction that there be an apportionment of the assessment in accordance with the respective uses of the property under the provisions of Code, \u00a7 58-16. This section reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b531-5\"><em>\u201cAssessment of building used only partly for benevolent, religious or charitable purposes.\u2014In </em>assessing any building and the land it occupies which may be owned exclusively by any organization or association mentioned in \u00a7 58-12 but all of which is not used exclusively for its purposes, the assessing officers shall only assess for taxation that portion of said property subject to any such lease or otherwise a source of profit or revenue and the tax shall be computed on the basis of the ratio of the space subject to any such lease or otherwise a source of profit or revenue to the entire property; provided that when any such property is leased for portions of a year the tax shall be computed on the basis of the average use of such property for the preceding year.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b531-6\">Such request for an apportionment of the assessment was not presented to the lower court, is not within the assignments of error before us, and is not discussed in the briefs. But aside from this, we find that this statute is not applicable to the present situation.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-7\">In the first place, it will be observed that the statute provides for the assessment of \u201cthat portion\u201d of the property which is \u201csubject to\u201d a lease or is \u201cotherwise a source of profit or revenue\u201d \u201con the basis of the ratio\u201d which that \u201cspace\u201d bears \u201cto the entire property.\u201d Thus, where a portion of a budding is used for benevolent, religious or charitable purposes, and a portion is \u201csubject to\u201d a lease or is \u201cotherwise a source of profit or revenue,\u201d the latter is assessable for taxation. In the present case, those portions of the building which were used by the outside agencies were not leased to them by, nor were they \u201ca source of profit or revenue\u201d to, UGF, as contemplated by the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>In the next place, what is equally important, there was no separation or division of space in the building for the use of UGF and its agencies, on the one hand, and the use of the outside agencies on the other hand, as the statute contemplates. Both used the same space or rooms, from time to time, as the occasions required.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-4\">The antecedent of this statute was construed and applied in <em>City of Richmond </em>v. <em>Grand Lodge of Virginia, </em>162 Va. 471, 174 S. E. 846. There a portion of a lodge building was leased for commercial purposes while the remainder was used exclusively for lodge purposes and meeting rooms. We pointed out that, \u201cThe language of the section in terms exempts from taxation such part or parts of the buildings and land of such institutions as are used exclusively for lodge purposes or meeting rooms, and provides only for the assessment of that part of the buildings and land that is used for other purposes.\u201d 162 Va. at 476.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-5\">This is in accord with the statement in Cooley on Taxation, 4th Ed., Vol. 2, \u00a7 688, pp. 1443, 1444, that under such statutes <em>\u201cif the exempt and nonexempt parts are separable, </em>for purposes of valuation, the former should be held not taxable and the latter taxable.\u201d (Emphasis added.) See also, 84 C. J. S., Taxation, \u00a7 232, p. 450.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-6\">Accordingly, there is no basis for the suggestion by the city that there may be an apportionment of the assessment in accordance with the respective uses of the property under the provisions of Code, \u00a7 58-16.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-7\">Being of opinion that the lower court correctly held that this property was exempt from taxation under \u00a7 183(f) of the Constitution and Code, \u00a7 58-12(6), it is unnecessary that we deal with the other questions discussed in the briefs.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-8\">The order appealed from is</p>\n<p id=\"b532-9\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
