The motion alleged that on February 26, 1958, defendant negligently delayed, at its railway crossing on Granby street<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>, certain Norfolk fire apparatus that was proceeding to a fire at plaintiff\u2019s place of business, which delay proximately caused the fire to get out of control and resulted in property damage to plaintiff in the sum of $398,521.37. At the conclusion of plaintiff\u2019s evidence, the trial court sustained defendant\u2019s motion to strike plaintiff\u2019s evidence and entered summary judgment for defendant. We awarded plaintiff a writ of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b1042-5\">The plaintiff was the owner and operator of Ocean View Amusement Park which was located between Ocean View avenue and the Chesapeake Bay at the northern end of Granby street in Norfolk. Granby street runs north and south; Ocean View avenue runs east and west. Hence, the intersection of Granby street and Ocean View avenue forms the letter \u201cT\u201d. The plaintiff\u2019s facilities consisted of ten buildings or structures. They all faced Chesapeake Bay with the exception of the roller coaster which was located on Ocean View avenue. Norfolk and Western Railway Company owns railroad tracks which run generally in an east-west direction and cross Granby street at grade about three miles south of plaintiff\u2019s amusement park in an area known as Wards Corner.</p>\n<p id=\"b1042-6\">On February 26, 1958, a fire developed in the merry-go-round building of the amusement park and the first alarm was given at 6:25 p.m. Personnel from five Norfolk fire companies responded with a total of four pieces of fire fighting equipment and a salvage truck. Two of the companies were stationed close by and they dispatched two pumpers and a hook and ladder which appeared at the scene in about one minute after the alarm sounded. Some of the equipment came from Thole street station and had to cross defendant\u2019s tracks on Granby street. The crossing was not blocked and it arrived in a matter of minutes. None of the equipment which responded to the first alarm was delayed in any manner. Chief J. L. Ballard, who answered the first alarm, testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1043-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"951\">*951</page-number>\u201cQ. All right, sir. Now, then, when you arrived at that fire can you describe its condition to us?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1043-4\">\u201cA. It was a lot of fire there and in my opinion it was out of control.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1043-5\"># # # # *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1043-6\">\u201cQ. Chief, limiting opinions, then, I just want you to describe the nature of the fire. Was it entirely inside the building so that you could just see it through a window somewhere or was it outside?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1043-7\">\u201cA. It was outside of the building. It was coming through the windows and leaping over the top of the roof and it possibly\u2014I couldn\u2019t tell whether part of the roof had fallen in or not, but I know the flames were leaping much higher than the roof when I arrived.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1043-8\">\u201cQ. Now, did that condition progress or recede?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1043-9\">\u201cA. It progressed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1043-10\">\u201cQ. In what direction?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1043-11\">\u201cA. West.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1043-12\">\u201cA. West and south, I should say, because it caught the Leap the Dip.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1043-13\">\u201cQ. Well, were your forces hampered in their fighting the fire by any physical factors, weather conditions or any other factors?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1043-14\">\u201cA. Well, the weather conditions, the velocity of the wind that was blowing tended to spread it extremely fast, and the nature of the material that was being consumed, being dry lumber, tended to accelerate the spread of the fire, and as far as\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1043-15\">\u201cQ. Was this accessible to the buildings?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1043-16\">\u201cA. No, it wasn\u2019t. We were greatly hampered by the chain link fence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1043-17\">A second alarm was sounded by Captain R. F. Joyner at 6:26 p.m., one minute after the first alarm. He observed the magnitude of the fire just before he reached it while answering the first alarm and decided that help was needed. His alarm alerted three additional fire companies, and three pieces of equipment proceeded immediately toward the scene of the fire. When two of the vehicles arrived at the crossing on Granby street at Wards Corner they were compelled to stop because defendant\u2019s automatic gates were down and a train was crossing the street. Captain H. M. Boggs stated that his fire truck was delayed for the length of time it required the train to pass over the crossing, and J. T. Pierce said that his fire truck was delayed for a maximum of two minutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b1043-18\">A third alarm was given at 6:34 p.m., and each of two companies <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"952\">*952</page-number>dispatched a pumper. It took these vehicles about five minutes to reach Granby street crossing. The gates were down and a train was crossing Granby street. The captains estimated that their trucks were delayed at the crossing approximately five minutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b1044-4\">Three officials of plaintiff corporation, who were proceeding to the fire scene, testified in effect that about 6:30 p.m. the crossing was continuously blocked by the gates and a passing train up to a period of fifteen minutes. During this interval they observed certain fire equipment also delayed at the crossing.</p>\n<p id=\"b1044-5\">Dudley Cooper, one of plaintiff\u2019s officials who were blocked at the crossing, stated that he arrived at the fire scene about 6:55 p.m.; that only the merry-go-round building was burning; that \u201cthere was only a couple of streams going on that fire at the time\u201d; that he observed this building burn for fifteen minutes before the fire spread southwestwardly and ultimately burned six additional buildings or structures belonging to plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b1044-6\">There was no evidence of a standing train at the crossing. The official records of the railroad introduced by plaintiff show that two trains moved along the Granby street crossing during the time in question. The first train was outbound and departed defendant\u2019s marshalling yards at Sewells Point, which is about two miles west of the crossing, at 6:25 p.m. It was about 7500 feet long and passed over the crossing at a speed of 20 to 25 miles per hour.</p>\n<p id=\"b1044-7\">The second train was about 7100 feet in length and was proceeding westerly or inbound towards Sewells Point at a speed of approximately 20 miles per hour when it crossed Granby street. It passed the first train in the vicinity of Simpson\u2019s curve, which begins about 4,000 feet east of the crossing. The defendant\u2019s records disclose that the inbound train had crossed Granby street and stopped at Camp Allen at 6:35 p.m.</p>\n<p id=\"b1044-8\">It is not clear from the evidence whether the automatic gates opened between the time the first and second trains passed over the crossing. In the view we take of the case this is immaterial, and we may assume for the purposes of this opinion that defendant\u2019s moving trains obstructed the Granby street crossing continuously for a period of fifteen minutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b1044-9\"> The trial court struck plaintiff\u2019s evidence on the ground that, assuming defendant was negligent, there was no showing of proximate cause. Having reached this conclusion the court did not consider it necessary to decide whether I 27-86 of Norfolk City Code <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"953\">*953</page-number>1950, <em>infra, </em>which limits obstruction time at grade crossings, applied to moving trains.</p>\n<p id=\"b1045-4\">Here, plaintiff does not contend that there was any common law negligence on the part of defendant. Indeed, the record is devoid of evidence showing any such negligence. However, plaintiff maintains that there was ample evidence to show that defendant obstructed its crossing on Granby street in violation of a Norfolk city ordinance (\u00a7 27-86) which constituted negligence <em>per se </em>and that whether such negligence was the proximate cause of its damages should have been submitted to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b1045-5\">On the other hand, defendant takes the position that there was no evidence that the ordinance was violated because it applied only to standing trains and that even if the ordinance did apply to moving trains the evidence failed to show proximate cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b1045-6\">Section 27-86 of Norfolk City Code, 1950, provided in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1045-7\">\u201cBetween the hours of 6:00 A.M. and 12:00 midnight following <em>* * * </em>the crossing at grade of any public street or avenue in any part of the city <em>* * * shall not be obstructed by a locomotive engine, car or train </em>for more than eight minutes at any one time, and if any such crossing is obstructed for said period of eight minutes between said hours, there shall be immediately an interval of at least five minutes before said crossing is again obstructed * # *. (Italics supplied.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1045-8\"><em>M. \u00bft. JJ. </em>w \u00cdF w w</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1045-10\">\u201cFor a violation of this section the railroad company # # shall be subject to a fine in any sum not more than fifty dollars for each offense.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1045-12\">The dominant question presented is whether the prohibited obstruction under the ordinance applies to a moving train. If not, it is manifest that no actionable negligence has been established.</p>\n<p id=\"b1045-13\">The plaintiff cites no case, nor have we found one, in which it has been held that a moving train obstructed a crossing in violation of a city ordinance. An examination of the authorities discloses that many of the statutes or ordinances which regulate the time that a railroad may obstruct a crossing expressly include the words \u201cremain standing\u201d, \u201cstand on or across\u201d, or words of similar import. See <em>Houren </em>v. <em>Chicago, M. &amp; St. P. Ry. Co., </em>236 Ill. 620, 86 N.E. 611; <em>Cleveland, C., C. &amp; St. L. Ry. Co. </em>v. <em>Tauer, </em>176 Ind. 621, 96 N.E. 758; <em>Cleveland, C., C. &amp; St. L. Ry. Co. </em>v. <em>Gillespie, </em>96 Ind. App. 535, 173 N.E. 708; <em>Tyler </em>v. <em>Chicago &amp; Eastern Illinois Railway, </em>241 Ind. 463, 173 N.E. 2d 314; <em>Missouri-Kansas-Texas R. Co. </em>v. <em>Neuhoff </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"954\">*954</page-number><em>Bros., </em>Tex. Civ. App., 297 S.W. 2d 316; <em>Mlenek </em>v. <em>Fleming, </em>224 Minn. 38, 27 N.W. 2d 800; <em>Walker </em>v. <em>Missouri Pac. Ry. Co., 95 </em>Kan. 702, 149 P. 677.</p>\n<p id=\"b1046-4\">It is evident from a careful consideration of the ordinance that it does not apply to moving trains. The ordinance refers to \u201ca locomotive engine, car or train\u201d, and the word \u201cmoving\u201d does not appear anywhere therein. Certainly, a single moving locomotive engine or car could not possibly obstruct a railroad crossing for a period in excess of eight minutes regardless of speed. Since the ordinance has reference to a standing locomotive or car, we think that it also contemplates a standing train.</p>\n<p id=\"b1046-5\">Moreover, there is another reason why we feel constrained to interpret the ordinance as applicable only to standing trains. If it were construed to apply to moving trains, the ordinance, in effect, would or could limit the length of a train and thereby unreasonably hinder the free flow of commerce between the states in contravention of the commerce clause of the Federal Constitution. (Article 1, \u00a7 8)</p>\n<p id=\"b1046-6\">In <em>Kahn </em>v. <em>Southern Ry. Co., </em>202 F. 2d 875 there were two city ordinances involved. The first ordinance provided in part: \u201cAny corporation, conductor, engineer, or other employee of any steam railroad company having tracks running across the public streets of this city, who shall obstruct the same, or prevent the free passage of vehicles and pedestrians longer than three minutes at one time, shall be subject to a penalty.\u201d The second ordinance limited the speed of trains \u201calong, through or across any street\u201d in the city to 4 miles per hour. Defendant\u2019s train was stopped on a crossing for two minutes and then proceeded to move over the crossing at a speed of 4 to 6 miles per hour. Its movement consumed approximately twenty minutes and prevented certain fire apparatus from reaching the scene of plaintiff\u2019s fire. The court construed the two ordinances together and said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1046-7\">\u201cIt is also true that the passing train obstructed the street longer than the period of three minutes prescribed by Ordinance No. 537; but we think that this provision must be interpreted as applying to trains standing still in the body of the street and not to trains moving on the railroad\u2019s right of way. * * <em>*</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1046-8\">\u201cIf, on the other hand, Ordinance No. 537 was intended to apply to moving trains then, in our opinion, the ordinance must be held to be invalid as contravening the commerce clause of the Federal Constitution. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1047-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"955\">*955</page-number>\u201c* * # No additional evidence is needed to show that the ordinances so construed come within the condemnation of the following passage from Southern Pacific Co. v. Arizona, 325 U.S. 761, at page 775, 65 S. Ct. 1515, at page 1523:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1047-4\">\u201c \u2018If one state may regulate train lengths, so may all the others, and they need not prescribe the same maximum limitation. The practical effect of such regulation is to control train operations beyond the boundaries of the state exacting it because of the necessity of breaking up and reassembling long trains at the nearest terminal points before entering and after leaving the regulating state. The serious impediment to the free flow of commerce by the local regulation of train lengths and the practical necessity that such regulation, if any, must be prescribed by a single body having a nation-wide authority are apparent.\u2019 \u201d 202 F. 2d at pp. 878, 879.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1047-5\">There is a well recognized canon of construction that when a statute or an ordinance is susceptible of two constructions, one of which is within the legislative power and the other without, the courts are required to adopt the former construction. <em>Adams Express Co. </em>v. <em>Charlottesville Woolen Mills, </em>109 Va. 1, 5, 63 S.E. 8; <em>Bourne </em>v. <em>Board of Supervisors, </em>161 Va. 678, 684, 685, 172 S.E. 245; 17 M.J., Statutes, \u00a7 30, p. 277. In applying this rule we hold that the ordinance in question applies to standing trains and not to moving trains. Thus, defendant did not violate the ordinance as contended, and no actionable negligence was shown.</p>\n<p id=\"b1047-6\">Since we hold that defendant was not guilty of negligence, the question of proximate cause becomes moot. However, upon a consideration of the entire record, we find that the evidence adduced relating to proximate cause was too speculative and lacked sufficient probative value to sustain a verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b1047-7\">For the reasons stated, the judgment appealed from is</p>\n<p id=\"b1047-8\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1042-7\">At the time in question the tracks were owned by The Virginian Railway Company and its trains were involved. Prior to the institution of this action The Virginian Railway Company merged with Norfolk and Western Railway Company.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
