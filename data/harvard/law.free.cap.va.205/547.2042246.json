Vol.). His punishment was fixed at a fine of $200.00 and confinement in jail for a period of sixty days, the jail sentence being suspended during his good behavior for one year. We granted the defendant a writ of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>The sole question in the case is whether the trial court erred in admitting into evidence the results of the chemical analysis of the defendant\u2019s blood sample.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-5\">The evidence shows that on the night of April 13, 1963, Harry J. Hughes, Jr., a deputy sheriff of Pulaski County, observed a vehicle being operated in an erratic manner on Robinson Track Road. He caused the vehicle to be stopped and discovered the defendant to be its operator. The deputy detected that the defendant had the odor of alcohol on his breath, that he was unsteady on his feet and that he was \u201cthick-tongued.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b640-6\">The defendant was arrested and upon being advised of his right to a blood test, at first refused but later consented to take such a test. He was taken to Pulaski Hospital where, within two hours of the time of his arrest, a sample of blood was withdrawn from his arm by Mrs. Jean Alderman, a registered nurse.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-7\">An analysis of the sample, made by the office of the Chief Medical Examiner in Richmond, disclosed that the defendant\u2019s blood contained 0.22 per cent by weight of alcohol.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-8\">Mrs. Alderman, in sterilizing the defendant\u2019s arm, preparatory to withdrawing his blood, had used ether. It is this use of ether, the defendant contends, which rendered inadmissible the results of his blood test.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-9\">The defendant relies on Code, \u00a7 18.1-55 (c), 1960 Repl. Vol., 1962 Supp., as it read on the date of his arrest,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> which required that the prescribed persons withdrawing blood, for chemical analysis in driving under the influence cases, use some type of cleanser or sterilizer, \u201c. . . for the part of the body from which the blood is taken, other than alcohol or other substance which might in any way affect the accuracy of the test.\u201d The defendant argues that ether is a, \u201csubstance which might in any way affect the accuracy of the test\u201d and was, therefore, excluded from use as a sterlizing agent in the chemical analysis now under consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-10\">It will be noted that alcohol was the only substance specifically prohibited by Code, \u00a7 18.1-55 (c) from use as a cleanser or sterilizer. We are of opinion that it was a question of fact whether the use of some other substance, \u201cmight in any way affect the accuracy of the test.\u201d The crucial inquiry in this case, therefore, is whether the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>evidence supports the trial court\u2019s finding that the use of ether on the defendant\u2019s arm did not adversely affect the admissibility of the results of the test here involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-4\">Mrs. Alderman, the registered nurse who withdrew the blood from the defendant\u2019s arm,, testified as a witness for the Commonwealth. She stated that the use of ether would not, \u201cin any way affect the blood stream of the person from whom\u201d blood is withdrawn. She admitted, on cross-examination, that ether is a derivative of alcohol, but insisted that ether \u201cevaporates immediately\u201d and could not, \u201cget into the veins.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b641-5\">Gerald V. Clark, chief laboratory technician at Pulaski Hospital, was called as a witness for the Commonwealth. He testified that if ether, \u201cwere allowed to get into the sample, it would certainly have the same effect as that amount of alcohol.\u201d He said, however, in the context of driving under the influence cases, that ether is, \u201cin the approved category\u201d as a sterilizer. He explained that ether evaporates \u201calmost instantly\u201d and that, \u201cif it\u2019s evaporated, it couldn\u2019t get into the blood stream.\u201d He further stated that if the person withdrawing blood were to swab the patient\u2019s arm with ether and then pick up \u201cthe needle\u201d, it would not be possible to place \u201cthe needle\u201d on the arm before the ether would evaporate. Finally, Mr. Clark testified that, \u201cthe very purpose of using ether is to avoid contaminating the blood sample in any way.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b641-6\">No evidence was introduced by the defendant to contradict or counteract the testimony given by Mrs. Alderman and Mr. Clark.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-7\">We are aware that the statute here involved, as it read on the date of the defendant\u2019s arrest, required strict compliance with its terms, otherwise the accused, \u201cshall be deemed to have been prejudiced, and he shall be found not guilty.\u201d Code, \u00a7 18.1-55 (f), 1960 Repl. Vol., 1962 Supp.; <em>Lutz </em>v. <em>City of Richmond, </em>205 Va. 93, 97, 98, 135 S. E. 2d 156; <em>Kyhl </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>205 Va. 240, 243, 135 S. E. 2d 768.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-8\">The statute under consideration was a technical one and its technicalities had to be observed. But, in determining whether the prescribed steps have been followed, the evidence must, nonetheless, be given a reasonable view. When that is done, it is manifest that the trial court was justified in finding that the use of ether on the defendant\u2019s arm did not render inadmissible the results of his blood test.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>The trial judge stated, \u201cThere is ample evidence in this case to show a full and complete compliance with the statute enacted by the Legislature.\u201d That conclusion, and the conviction that followed, are supported by the evidence. Accordingly, the judgment will be</p>\n<p id=\"b642-5\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b640-11\"> Code, \u00a7 18.1-55 was repealed <em>by </em>the General Assembly at its 1964 session and Code, \u00a7 18.1-55.1 was enacted to prescribe the procedures to be followed in chemical tests to determine the amount of alcohol in blood in driving under the influence cases</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
