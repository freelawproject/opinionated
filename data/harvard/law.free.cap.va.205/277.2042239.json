The jury fixed his punishment at a fine of $200 and by confinement in jail for a term of one month. Code, \u00a7 18.1-58. The case is before us upon writ of error and supersedeas to the judgment of conviction entered on the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-12\">On April 1, 1963, at approximately 7:45 p.m. trooper P. R. Jeffrey, Jr., was proceeding north on U. S. Route No. 17 in Essex county. He was \u201cattempting to clock\u201d the speed of a station wagon. When the speed of that vehicle was slackened he observed a pick-up truck in front of it traveling in the same direction, which was being driven by Caldwell, the defendant, over into the southbound lane and back into the northbound lane. The trooper was unable to pass defendant\u2019s truck and waited until it reached Brays Fork, a short distance away. There defendant turned his vehicle into a service station and ran it up on a curb between eight and twelve inches in height. The truck <em>\u201crolled </em>back\u201d off the curb and defendant drove it again onto the curb. According to the trooper this performance occurred''three times. The defendant alighted from his vehicle' and the trooper <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>observed that he was \u201cunsteady on his feet, his eyes were glassy, and he had thick speech.\u201d A \u201cfaint odor of alcohol\u201d was detected on his breath. A bottle of vodka was found on the seat of the truck and defendant stated that he had \u201chad a couple of drinks with a war buddy of his\u201d from this bottle.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-5\">The trooper informed defendant that he was being placed under arrest for operating his vehicle under the influence of alcohol, and that \u201ca new Virginia law required you to submit to a blood test.\u201d The trooper asked defendant \u201cwould he like to take one\u201d and he replied: \u201c[Y]es, let\u2019s go and get it over with now.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b371-6\">The trooper carried defendant to a justice of the peace who issued a warrant charging him with the offense for which he was tried and convicted. From there he was taken to the office of Dr. Douglas Andrews in Tappahannock where 20 c.c. of defendant\u2019s blood was extracted for chemical analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-7\">The defendant testified that it was his intention to proceed south on Route No. 360 towards Richmond; that by mistake he took U. S. Route 17 where it intersects with Route No. 360; that after he had traveled a short distance he turned around and proceeded back, \u201clooking at the signs\u201d in order to turn left on Route No. 360; that while looking for the signs he \u201cprobably\u201d crossed over the center line of the highway, and that he drove into the service station to get his bearings and information about making the desired turn. He further testified that he was not \u201cintoxicated\u201d, and that an operation for varicose veins in his leg affected his ability to walk.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-8\">In his assignments of error defendant contends that the court erred in admitting in evidence the results of the blood test, and in refusing to strike the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence and dismiss the prosecution because (1) the Commonwealth failed to comply with the provisions of Code, \u00a7 18.1-55<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>, the \u201cImplied Consent Law\u201d, and (2) he \u201cwas <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>deprived of his right not to give evidence against himself, as guaranteed to him under the Constitutions of Virginia and the United States.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b372-5\">The defendant contends that the Commonwealth failed to comply with Code, \u00a7 18.1-55 in that (1) the trooper failed to inform him of the provisions of the law; (2) the doctor who extracted his blood did not comply with the plain mandate of the statute; (3) he was deprived of his right to have a separate sample of his blood analyzed.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-6\">The defendant argues that the trooper failed to advise him \u201cthat he had the right to refuse to take such blood test; that he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>had the right to request same within a two-hour period; that if practicable, he had the right to have a physician of his own choice administer the blood test; or that he would be entitled to know the results of the test.\u201d He testified that he was told by the trooper that \u201cit was a new State law that you had to take\u201d a blood test, and that he would not have taken the test had he not been informed by the trooper that he was required under the law to do so. Thus, he says, he cannot be deemed to have consented to submit to the test, or to have waived his right not to consent.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">Under the statute any person who operates a motor vehicle upon a public highway in this Commonwealth shall be deemed to have consented to, and shall be entitled to, have a sample of his blood taken for a chemical analysis to determine its alcoholic content when arrested for operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol. In <em>Walton </em>v. <em>City of </em>Roanoke, 204 Va. 678, 133 S. E. 2d 315, we said that \u201cthe defendant was not compelled under \u00a7 18.1-55 to submit to the blood test. He had a choice of either allowing the test to be made or refusing it.\u201d We adhere to that holding. However, the statute does require an accused to submit to a blood test in order to avoid prosecution for refusing to take it, which may result in the suspension of his operator\u2019s license if such refusal is found to be unreasonable. He has the power to refuse to submit to the test but no right to refuse it. Since there exists no \u201cright to refuse\u201d to submit to a blood test, the trooper was without authority to advise defendant that he had such a right. Furthermore, defendant orally consented to submit to the test so that it was not incumbent upon the trooper to advise him of the consequences if he refused. Had defendant refused to submit to the test, it then would have been the duty of the trooper to advise the accused that \u201crefusal to do so constitutes grounds for the revocation of the privilege of operating a motor vehicle upon the highways of this State\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-6\">There is no provision in the statute which expressly requires that the arresting officer advise the accused of his rights to request a test within a two-hour period; to have, if practicable, a physician of his own choice to extract his blood, or to know the results of the test. These provisions are available to an accused but are merely directory, not mandatory, insofar as they apply to the arresting officer. We conclude that the failure of the trooper to inform defendant of the provisions of the statute complained of did not constitute a lack of compliance.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-7\">It is next contended that the doctor failed to comply with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>mandate of the statute, because the record does not show that the instruments he used in extracting defendant\u2019s blood were sterilized and because he did not personally perform certain acts prescribed by the statute. Defendant makes no claim that the containers were not especially equipped with a sealing device and were not sealed so as to prevent tampering.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">The statute requires the using of \u201csome type of a cleanser or sterilizer for the instruments used and for the part of the body from which the blood is taken, other than alcohol or other substance which might in anyway affect the accuracy of the test,\u201d in extracting blood for analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-6\">Dr. Andrews testified emphatically that he washed defendant\u2019s arm with \u201can antiseptic surgical soap\u201d, which contained no alcohol or other substance which might in any way affect the accuracy of the test. With respect to sterilization of the instruments used, he had this to say:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b374-7\">\u201cBy Mr. Overton:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b374-8\">######</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b374-9\">\u201cQ.

The patient was seated in a chair, his arm was resting on our examining table, and a tourniquet, a stretchable rubber strip, was placed around his upper arm. This makes the veins stand out so I can better find the vein, and cause less pain. The accused\u2019s arm was then wiped off and washed off thoroughly with a surgical soap. The syringe was taken from its sterile container. It was a sterile needle. It was placed on the syringe\u2014the needle was\u2014then inserted* into the vein, and twenty CC\u2019s of blood were withdrawn from the patient\u2019s vein.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b374-11\"><em>M. </em>4t&gt; lit. , 'Jl' \u25a0Jp is-</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b374-13\">\u201cQ.

I can testify that all the syringes in the office are cleaned and sterilized by me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b376-28\">\u201cQ. Every morning?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b376-29\">\u201cA. Every morning.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b376-30\">In <em>Kyhl </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>205 Va. 240, 135 S. E. 2d 768, we said that the statute does not require that the instruments used in extracting blood be sterilized in the presence of the accused. The statute clearly states that the instruments must be cleansed or sterilized, but it does not specify by whom or when such must be done. We hold that there was sufficient evidence adduced for the jury to conclude <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>that the instruments used were properly sterilized before extracting defendant\u2019s blood.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-5\">The defendant argues that \u201cThe statute requires that the physician break open the containers [boxes], take out and open the vials sealed therein, withdraw the sample of blood and place it in the vials, close the vials and replace them in the containers, seal the containers and deliver one to the arresting officer and the other to the defendant.\u201d He points out that the trooper performed some of these acts. However, the evidence shows that they were done at the request of the doctor in his presence and in the presence of defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-6\">The statute specifically requires that only a physician, registered professional nurse or graduate laboratory technician may extract the blood, and that after it has been placed in the vials, labelled and sealed, \u201cOne sample shall then be delivered by the person who withdrew it to the police officer * * * and the other sample shall be delivered to the person accused * # The statute does not specify that the person who extracts the blood must personally perform the other procedures mentioned. The evidence is uncontradicted that Dr. Andrews extracted defendant\u2019s blood. It is true that he did not actually hand the accused\u2019s sample to him. It was delivered to defendant by the trooper at the doctor\u2019s request and in his presence. That constituted a valid delivery by the doctor. We find that the doctor did not fail to comply with the statute on the grounds relied upon.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-7\">As has been stated defendant was given a sample of his blood. He was also given an instruction sheet containing the names and addresses of laboratories authorized to analyze his blood and stating, among other things, that the sample \u201cshould be taken or mailed-without delay\u201d. Upon his arrival at the jail he was incarcerated and his sample was taken from him without objection by the jailer for safekeeping. No one offered to take or mail the sample for him nor did he make the request of anyone. The sample and the instruction sheet were returned to defendant when he was released about 18 hours later. He was asked:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b377-8\">\u201cQ. Did you ever send it to any of those laboratories?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b377-9\">\u201cA. No, sir. It said on those instructions that it had to be done immediately, right now, so seventeen or eighteen hours after I didn\u2019t figure it was worth sending in, so I throwed it away.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b377-10\">The instruction sheet did not state that the blood sample \u201cmust\u201d be forwarded to a private laboratory \u201cimmediately\u201d. It stated; \u201cTo <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>insure the fullest possible protection of your rights, the container should be taken or mailed-without delay.\u201d If defendant had forwarded his blood sample after he was released it would have been \u201cwithout delay.\u201d He made no inquiry or request and decided to throw away his sample. Under these circumstances it cannot be said that he was, through no fault of his own, deprived of his right to have his blood sample analyzed and the results thereof received in evidence. Thus, he was not entitled to have the prosecution dismissed under the provisions of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-5\">Finally, defendant contends that he was deprived of his right not to give evidence against himself in violation of \u00a7 8 of the Constitution of Virginia and the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States. In <em>Walton </em>v. <em>City of Roanoke, supra, </em>we held that \u00a7 18.1-55 was not violative of these constitutional provisions. The defendant does not attack the constitutionality of the statute itself but he contends that it is unconstitutional as applied in the case at bar. He argues that his submission to the blood test was unlawfully obtained because he was told by the trooper that he was required to submit under the statute and was not advised that he had the right to refuse such a test. There has been no showing of coercion. By operating his motor vehicle upon a public highway defendant, under the statute, was deemed to have consented to take the blood test. When asked if he would like to take the test, he expressly consented. As was previously said defendant had the power to refuse the blood test but he had no right to refuse it. We find that this contention is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-6\">We hold that the trial court did not err in admitting in evidence the certificate attested by the Chief Medical Examiner, which showed defendant\u2019s blood contained 0.18% alcohol by weight, and in refusing to strike the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence and dismiss the prosecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-7\">For the reasons stated, the judgment appealed from is</p>\n<p id=\"b378-8\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b371-9\"> \u00a7 18.1-5J. \u201cUse of chemical test to determine alcohol in blood; procedure; costs; evidence; suspension of license for refusal to submit to test.\u2014* * *</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-10\">\u201c(b) Any person, whether licensed by Virginia or not, who operates a motor vehicle upon a public highway in this State on and after July one, nineteen hundred sixty-two shall be deemed thereby to have agreed as a condition of such operation to consent to, and shall be entitled to, have a sample of his blood taken for a chemical test to determine the alcoholic content thereof if he is arrested for a violation of \u00a7 18.1-54 * * *.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-11\">\u201c(c) Only a physician, registered professional nurse or graduate laboratory technician, using some type of a cleanser or sterilizer for the instruments used and for the part of the body from which the blood is taken, other than alcohol or other substance which might in any way affect the accuracy of the test, shall withdraw blood for the purpose of determining the alcoholic content therein; where practicable, the physician of such person\u2019s choice shall withdraw said blood.
