Lea, Frank B. Barker, and the Board of Supervisors of Halifax County, defendants,, from condemning a roadway across complainants\u2019 land.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"687\">*687</page-number>Sometime prior to May 7, 1962, Floyd J. Lea (also spelled Lee) and Frank B. Barker petitioned the Board of Supervisors of Halifax County to establish a private outlet across the land of complainants. On May 7, 1962, the board appointed five viewers pursuant to Code, \u00a7 33-142 to go upon complainants\u2019 land and report \u201cupon the expediency of establishing or altering the location of such private outlet\u201d. It directed that all costs \u201cincident to this action\u201d be paid by petitioners. (\u00a7 33-153) Four of the viewers went upon the land and reported to the board that there was a necessity for estabhshing a road \u201cIn Mt. Carmel District beginning on Rt. 693 and going SW through the land of Hallie Foster, Anna Foster and Mary Foster a distance of about 1200 feet.\u201d The viewers further reported that the sum of $300 would be just compensation to complainants for the \u201c40 feet wide right of way\u201d through their land, and that \u201csaid road will be one of such mere private convenience as to make it proper that it should be opened, established or altered and kept in order by the * # # persons for whose convenience it is desired.\u201d (Lea and Barker)</p>\n<p id=\"b779-5\">On October 1, 1962, the board confirmed the viewers\u2019 report, and on October 17, 1962, complainants filed a bill of complaint praying that defendants be permanently enjoined from taking their land. The trial court heard evidence in the cause <em>ore tenus </em>on April 20, 1963 and thereafter entered a decree which provided in part: \u201cthe injunction sought by the complainants is hereby denied and the report of the viewers filed herein granting the defendants a right of way across the lands of the complainants is hereby confirmed and approved in every particular except that the right of way granted the defendants is hereby established at 30 feet.\u201d It is from this decree that we granted complainants an appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-6\">Complainants\u2019 farm fronts upon the western side of State Route No. 693 in Halifax county. Defendants Lea and Barker own farms that adjoin complainants\u2019 land. The Lea tract adjoins it on the south, and the Barker property adjoins it on the west. The Barker farm also adjoins the Lea farm on the west. Complainants own a dirt road about twelve feet wide and twelve hundred feet long which runs across their land from Route 693 to the Lea farm. It traverses the Lea farm and comes to a dead end upon the land of Barker. Lea, Barker,, and their predecessors in title have used the road for fifty years or more. It is not disputed that they have a private easement to use this road. At the time of trial, Lea and Barker each had a tenant living on their property.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"688\">*688</page-number>Over the years, complainants have always permitted Lea and Barker to use the road, but objected to their attempt to widen it. It was sometime after complainants interposed then* objection that Lea and Barker petitioned the board of supervisors to institute condemnation proceedings, which resulted in condemning the dirt road to a width of forty feet.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-5\">Complainants made four assignments of error to the actions of the lower court, but we are of opinion that there is only one fundamental issue that needs to be discussed. This issue is quite narrow, and it presents the following question for our determination: whether or not Code, \u00a7\u00a7 33-141 <em>et seq. </em>permit a county board of supervisors to condemn the land of one property owner and establish a private road for the benefit of adjacent property owners. Aside from any constitutional question involved we hold that the question must be answered in the negative.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-6\">The board of supervisors proceeded to condemn complainants\u2019 land pursuant to the provisions of Code, \u00a7 33-142. That section provides in part: \u201cWhenever the board of supervisors or other governing body of any county shall be of opinion that it is necessary to establish or alter the location of a <em>public road, * * * </em>it may appoint five viewers, who shall be resident freeholders of the county, any three of whom may act, to examine such roads or routes and report upon the expediency of establishing or altering the location of such <em>public road, </em># * #.\u201d (Italics supplied.) It authorizes a board of supervisors to take private property for the purpose of establishing a \u201cpublic road\u201d. Defendants concede that the board lacks authority to take private property for a private use.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-7\">In <em>Fallsburg, &amp;c. Co. </em>v. <em>Alexander, </em>101 Va. 98, 101, 43 S. E. 194, we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b780-8\">\u201cNeither in our Constitution, nor in the constitutions of other States of the Union, is there any express provision forbidding the Legislature to pass laws whereby the private property of one citizen may be taken and transferred to another for his private use. As has been well said by Green, J., in <em>Varner </em>v. <em>Martin, 21 </em>West. Va. [534, at page] 548: \u2018It was doubtless regarded as unnecessary to insert such a provision in the Constitution or bill of rights, as the exercise of such an arbitrary power of transferring by legislation the property of one person to another, without his consent, was contrary to the fundamental principles of every republican government; and in a republican government neither the legislative, executive, nor judicial de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"689\">*689</page-number>partment can possess unlimited power.\u2019 In that case it is further said that there is an entire concurrence of all the authorities in the proposition, that private property cannot be taken for private use, either with or without compensation.\u201d See <em>Boyd </em>v. <em>Ritter L. Co., </em>119 Va. 348, 351, 357, 370, 89 S. E. 273; <em>Heninger </em>v. <em>Peery, </em>102 Va. 896, 899, 47 S. E. 1013; 6 M. J., Eminent Domain, \u00a7 16, p. 701.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b781-5\">The record before us clearly indicates on its face that defendants were condemning complainants\u2019 land for a private use. The May 7 resolution of the board of supervisors stated that it was predicated \u201cUpon the application of F. B. Barker and F. J. Lee, incident to a proposed <em>private outlet </em>from the property of the said F. B. Barker and F. J. Lee in Mt. Carmel District of Halifax County, Virginia.\u201d (Italics supplied.) The heading of the resolution provided in part: \u201cPetition of F. B. Barker and F. J. <em>bee\u2014Private Outlet </em>in Mt. Carmel District.\u201d (Italics supplied.) Thus, it is readily apparent that the condemnation proceeding was begun in contravention of Code, \u00a7 33-142.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-6\">The proceeding not only contravened the express terms of Code, \u00a7 33-142 at its inception, but it also disregarded the statute at the time the viewers were appointed. The May 7 resolution designated five viewers \u201cincident to a proposed <em>private outlet </em>and ordered them to \u201cview the proposed <em>private outlet </em>in question and report to this Board upon the expedience of establishing or altering the location of such <em>private outlet. </em>* * # \u201d The words \u201cpublic road\u201d do not appear anywhere in the resolution, yet the words \u201cprivate outlet\u201d appear five times.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-7\">The report of the viewers stated that the road would \u201cProvide outlet for F. B. Barker, F. J. Lee and two other families.\u201d Defendants contend that a road may be public even though it leads only from a public highway to the dwelling or farm of a single person and serves only a few individuals. <em>Lewis </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>5 Gratt. (46 Va.) 265, 269. Defendants\u2019 contention is sound, but the road must be in fact a public road and not a private one.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-8\">In 17 M. J., Streets and Highways, \u00a7 2, p. 448, it is said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b781-9\">\u201cWhether a road sought to be established is a public highway or one merely for the benefit of private individuals is not tested by the fact that such individuals receive a greater benefit than the public generally. The test is not simply how many actually use the road, but how many have a free and unrestricted right in common to use it. If it is free and common to all the citizens, it is a public road.\u201d See <em>Heninger </em>v. <em>Peery, supra, </em>102 Va. at p. 899.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b782-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"690\">*690</page-number>The report of the viewers was made pursuant to the order of the board of supervisors. Since the order directed them to consider a \u201cproposed private outlet\u201d, it must be assumed that they did not consider the establishment of a public road that would be open to every one. The report dealt with the creation of such outlet for the convenience of Lea, Barker, and their two tenants.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-5\">When the court entered its decree on July 5 it did not use the words \u201cpublic road\u201d. It merely confirmed and approved the report of the viewers \u201cin every particular except that the right of way granted the defendants is hereby established at 30 feet.\u201d The decree had the effect of granting a private right of way across the land of complainants.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-6\">The language used in the condemnation proceeding shows that complainants\u2019 property was being taken for a private use. The board may not have intended that the condemned land would be used only for private purposes, but if it had been its intention to establish a public road pursuant to Code, \u00a7 33-142 it could easily have so stated in the resolution of May 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-7\">We hold that Code, \u00a7\u00a7 33-141 <em>et seq. </em>did not give the board of supervisors the authority to condemn complainants\u2019 land for the purpose of establishing a private road. The decree of July 5 is reversed and remanded with directions to the lower court that it enter an order restraining defendants from taking any part of the land of complainants pursuant to the May 7 resolution of the board of supervisors and the report of the viewers pursuant thereto.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-8\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
