After alleging the fact that appellant was engaged in the business of a retail liquor dealer, it is further averred that \"therein and therefrom his place of business there situate, anterior to the filing of this affidavit, between the hours of twelve o\u2019clock midnight of Saturday, August 22, 1908, and before five o\u2019clock a. m. of the following Monday, August 24, 1908, unlawfully sell and barter five bottles of whisky to one J. E. Edwards.\u201d The information follows the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-6\">The particular point of attack on the information and complaint is, that it fails to allege that the sale occurred before the making and filing of the pleadings. The allegation is express, that the sale occurred \"anterior\u201d to the filing of the pleadings, and between the hours of 12 o\u2019clock midnight of Saturday and 5 o\u2019clock the following Monday morning. We are of opinion that it is sufficiently stated that the offense occurred prior to the making of the pleading. This question has been definitely settled in the case of Wilson v. State, 15 Texas Crim. App., 150. In that case the pleadings were filed on the 31st day of August, 1883, and alleged that \"heretofore\u201d on the 31st day of August, 1883, the offense was committed. This was held a sufficient allegation that the offense was committed \"anterior\u201d to the presentment of the information. In the case of Williams v. State, 12 Texas Crim. App., 226, the offense was alleged to have been committed on the same day that the information was presented and without any allegation that the offense was anterior to the filing of the information, but in the Wilson case the court held that the word \u201cheretofore\u201d as used in the information was equivalent to a direct allegation that the offense was committed anterior to the time of presenting the information. The complaint and information in the case in hand directly allege that the offense was committed anterior to the making and filing of the complaint and information. See also Williams v. State, 17 Texas Crim. App., 521. We are of opinion therefore, that there is no merit in this contention of appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-7\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-8\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
