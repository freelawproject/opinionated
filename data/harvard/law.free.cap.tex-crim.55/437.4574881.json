There is no merit in this objection. The facts of this case show that appellant and his codefendant, Powell Jack, were put off of a train, and after leaving same threw rocks at it, and the conductor came out and fired off his pistol, he saying he fired it in the air; other witnesses say he shot at the parties throwing rocks. The witness Jack Rolen happened to be near when the transaction occurred, and one of the boys in the presence of the other, as shown by circumstantial evidence, made the above statement to him, the said Jack Rolen. This renders the testimony altogether admissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-6\">Bill Ro. <em>2 </em>complains of the argument of the prosecuting attorney, wherein he used the following language: \u201cGentlemen of the jury, not long before all this happened (having reference to the throwing of the stone at the train) these boys were warned by one of their friends that if they did not be more careful they would be in trouble the first thing they knew.\u201d Whereupon the defendant\u2019s attorney then objected to said remark because the same was beyond the record, and was not based upon evidence, and the prosecuting attorney then stated to the jury: \u201cGentlemen of the jury, I will ask you not to consider the said remark. I thought it was right and proper, but I may be going a little too far.\u201d While this statement was not proper, it does not authorize a reversal of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-9\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-10\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
