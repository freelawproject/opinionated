Do you believe he told the truth when he made that statement? I am allowed by the court to argue this phase of the testimony to you on the question of his credibility as a witness in this ease.\u201d We are of opinion that this testimony was too remote. The State ought not to be permitted to inquire into crimes, or any other wrong that a man may have committed fifteen vears before. This question has been so often decided bv this court that it is not necessary to cite authorities. It is sufficient to say that if this testimony was not admissible the introduction of the same by the State, the singling of this fact out by the court and charging upon it, the severe allusion to it by the State\u2019s attorney and his arraign<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>ment of the appellant, charging him with telling a falsehood about the facts of his conviction in said case, was not only irrelevant, but highly prejudicial to the rights of the defendant, for which this case should be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-5\">We find no other errors in the record. We think the charge of the court presented all the issues of the case, and also in an affirmative way presented the defenses to the jury, and for the error alone of admitting the testimony of the previous conviction of the appellant the case should be reversed and remanded and it is so ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-6\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
