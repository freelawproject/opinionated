The charge is upon the weight of the evidence. It is a question of fact and not of law as to where a sale takes place. If the facts are undisputed that a sale takes place in a certain county, then it would be not amiss for the court to so say. But the evidence in this case suggested that appellant was acting as the agent of the prosecuting witness at the time said whisky was purchased, and appellant insists that it was purchased outside of the local option district and brought and delivered to the prosecuting witness in the local option district; that he had no recollection of being paid by prosecuting witness in the local option district for the whisky. It is true the State\u2019s case makes out a clear sale in Scurry County, where the prosecution was pending, but the defense\u2019s testimony suggests it was not. This is not a C. O. D. shipment, but an actual delivery of the whisky. We accordingly hold that the charge was on the weight of the evidence and should\" not have been given.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-10\">For the error above pointed out the judgment is reversed and the cause is remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-11\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
