A statute which imposes an occupation tax upon a certain class of subjects, and exempts from the payment of such tax any occupation within the same class so taxed, is in violation of the Constitution of Texas.

Subdivision 3 of article 5049 of the Bevised Civil Statutes, is as follows: \"Peddlers of Patent Medicines: From every traveling person selling patent, or other medicines, one hundred [one hundred and seventy-five] dollars, and no traveling person shall so sell until said tax is paid; provided, that this tax shall not apply to commercial travelers, drummers, or salesmen making sales, or soliciting trade for merchants engaged in the selling of drugs, or medicines by the wholesale.\u201d In the affidavit and information it is averred \u201cHe, the said J. L. Huffman, not then and there being a commercial traveler, drummer, or salesman soliciting trade for merchants selling drugs or medicines by the wholesale.\u201d It omits the words, \u201cor salesmen making sales.\u201d This precise question was decided in the case of Needham v. State, 51 Texas Crim. Rep., 248. See Rev. Stat., art. 5049, sub. 3; Rice v. State, 37 Texas Crim. Rep., 36; Williamson v. State, 55 S. W. Rep., 568-570; Potts v. State, 45 Texas Crim. Rep., 45; 74 S. W. Rep., 31. This, it may be stated, is the rule of common law from a very early period and is supported by an unbroken line of decisions in this State.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-10\">2. Counsel for appellant in the argument urged us to decide the question as to whether or not the law is constitutional. On motion for rehearing in Needham v. State, supra, Judge Henderson, speaking for the court, held that this law is constitutional, and that it did not exempt either of the classes named from the tax if they sell at retail, although they represent a wholesale house. Judge Davidson, however, took a different view of the question as will be noted by his dissenting opinion appearing in the official report of the case. It occurs to us that the reasoning of Judge Henderson is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>sound and gives the proper interpretation and construction of the statute. We deem it unnecessary to elaborate this view or to do more than to affirm the decision in the Needham case.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-5\">For the reason that the affidavit and information charge no offense against the law, the judgment of conviction is set aside, and the prosecution dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-6\">\n<em>Reversed and dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
