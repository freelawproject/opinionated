Article 411a under which appellant was prosecuted, is as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b163-6\">\u201cAny person or association of persons who shall engage in the sale of spirituous, vinous or malt liquors, or medicated bitters, without having obtained license therefor, shall be fined in any sum not less than the amount of the taxes so due and not more than double that sum, or imprisonment 'in the county jail from ten to ninety days in the discretion of the jury.\u201d The writer was first inclined to the belief that the information was sufficient but on more mature reflection it seems to be certain that it is not. The law levies a tax only on intoxicating malt liquors. It has been distinctly held (Ex parte Gray, 83 S. W. Rep., 838) that no tax can be levied in this State on non-intoxicating malt liquors. It would, beyond doubt, be essential to prove before a conviction could be had that such malt liquors were intoxicating. Petteway v. State, 36 Texas Crim. App., 197; 35 S. W. Rep., 646. It would seem to follow therefore, logically, having reference to the laws and decisions that the information must aver the intoxicating quality of the malt liquors alleged to be sold.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-7\">It is therefore ordered that the judgment of the court below, be and the same is hereby reversed and the prosecution dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-8\">\n<em>Reversed and dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
