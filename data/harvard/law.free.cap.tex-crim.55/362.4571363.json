And be it further remembered that there was no evidence of the loss or destruction of any license so issued to the defendant, nor of notice to the defendant or his attorneys to produce same. Whereupon the State offered in evidence a stub from said stub-book, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-5\">\u201cRetail (Liquor) Dealers License.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-6\">(Individual)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-7\">For the Sale of Spirituous, Vinous or Malt Liquors and Medicated Bitters.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-8\">No. 218.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-9\">Dallas County, Texas.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-10\">Issued to J. W. Ward,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-11\">for the sale of Spirituous, Vinous and Malt Liquors and Medicated Bitters in quantities of one gallon and less than one gallon to be drunk on the premises.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-12\">At 153 Main Street, Dallas County, Texas.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-13\">Date, Aug. 2, 1907.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-14\">State Tax.....$375.00</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-15\">County Tax.....$187.60</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-16\">City Tax......$......</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-17\">License expires July 31, 1908.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b387-18\">The above bill of exceptions was allowed with this qualification: \u201cSaid witness, Whitley, testified that this particular stub introduced in ' evidence was in his own handwriting. That the entry on the stub was made at the same time the license was issued. That all the liquor dealers in Dallas County procured license under the Baskin-McGregor law about the same time, and that he had no independent recollection of issuing a license to J. W. Ward. That the stub-book was kept by the county clerk for the clerk\u2019s convenience to show what licenses had been issued. No other records of licenses were kept, and that as he understood the law the stub-book was not required to be kept by the clerk. Afterwards the defendant on cross-examination admitted he had a liquor license covering the period of prosecution.\u201d Clearly in the light of the explanation of the court, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>and the admission of the defendant, there could have been no error in the ruling thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-3\">Bill of exceptions Ho. <em>2 </em>shows that defendant requested the court to give the following charge: \u201cYou are instructed that in this case the defendant has introduced testimony of the incorporation and chartering of the \u2018Down Town Athletic and Literary Club/ and you are further instructed that unless the State has proved beyond a reasonable doubt that said \u2018Down Town Athletic and Literary Club\u2019 is a mere subterfuge, and has further proved beyond a reasonable doubt that said business on the second floor of 153 Main Street was on August 18, 1907, the exclusive business of J. W. Ward and a part of his licensed business on the first floor, you will acquit the defendant. And the burden of proof is upon the State to establish said facts beyond a reasonable doubt. And unless you so believe from the evidence beyond a reasonable doubt you will acquit the defendant.\u201d In this connection the court charged the jury as follows: \u201cYou are further instructed that, if you believe from the evidence or have a reasonable doubt thereof that the house or place alleged to have been open or kept open between the hours of midnight Saturday, August 17, 1907, and five o\u2019clock a. m. of the following Monday, August 19, 1907, was at said time used as a bona fide club organized for the purpose of the support' and promotion of a literary undertaking providing literature for its members, and the promotion of athletic arts among its members and that said club was not a sham or subterfuge for the purpose of evading the Sunday law, then you will acquit the defendant.\u201d This charge certainly covered all that appellant could ask, to say the least of it. We think the evidence in this case scarcely warranted any charge of this character. Appellant owned the saloon and was running the upstairs, according to the evidence, in open violation of the law on Sunday, under the patent subterfuge of a literary club. The court very properly terms the defense a \u201csham;\u201d and such a thin disguise and wilful violation of the law scarcely requires a charge of any character. However, the court covered appellant\u2019s special charge in the main charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-10\">Appellant asked the court to give the following special charge: \u201cIf you should believe beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant J. W. Ward was conducting a separate and distinct bar and place of business on the second story of said building without a separate license therefor, he could not be convicted in this case.\u201d There is no evidence that it was a separate bar, hence the charge was not required.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-11\">The other charges of appellant as far as any of them were pertinent, were covered in the main charge of the court. The evidence in this case clearly supports the verdict of \"the jury. Appellant, in order to evade the law, had charge of the building and organized what he called a club, but the whole testimony shows <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>that he had exclusive control of the premises. The jury was amply warranted in their verdict, and the judgment is in all things affirmed.</p>\n<headnotes id=\"b389-6\">[Rehearing Denied March 17, 1909.\u2014Reporter.]</headnotes>\n<p id=\"b389-5\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
