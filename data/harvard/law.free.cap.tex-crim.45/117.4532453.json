In Brown v. State, 38 Texas Crim. Rep., 597, where a similar question was under consideration, this court used, the following, language: \u201cArticle 199, Penal Code, 1895, provides: \u2018Any merchant, grocer or dealer in wares or merchandise, or trader in any business whatsoever, or the proprietor of any place of public amusement, or the agent or employe of any such peson, who shall sell, barter, or permit his place of business or place of public amusement to be open for the purpose of traffic or public amusement on Sunday, shall be fined not less than twenty nor more than fifty dolars,\u2019 etc. Appellant was charged as agent and employe of N. C. Rhodes, who was conducting a saloon business, with unlawfully and willfully keeping open and permitting his store and place of business to be open for the purpose of traffic and sale on Sunday, and also charged with making a sale on Sunday to W. A. Sadler. Now if appellant sold (being engaged in this business) as the agent of Rhodes to W. A. Sadler, certain goods, wares and merchandise on Sunday, he violated the law. If he opened or permitted the saloon to be opened for the purpose of traffic and sale on Sunday, he would be guilty of violating this statute, with or without sale. The proof is unquestioned that the saloon was open on Sunday, and sales of beer and whisky were made to other parties besides Sadler. Concede for the argument that the jury may not have believed Sadler when he swore that he bought whisky, or that a sale was made to him; yet it can not be questioned, when all of the facts are taken together, that the saloon was open for the purpose of business on Sunday. All of the testimony in relation to sales to other people of beer and whisky introduced on the trial of this case was competent to establish the fact.that the house was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>open on Sunday for the purpose of engaging in the business. This is a misdemeanor; and the indictment contains two allegations, either of which, if found true, establishes an offense. The State was not bound to elect upon which count to proceed, because the statute provides that, if he is proved guilty of either, he could be legally convicted; and it was not necessary for the different states of facts to be set forth in separate counts.\u201d That portion of the indictment which charges appellant with being a trader in a lawful business, to wit, \u201cthat of a liquor dealer or keeper of a barroom,\u201d is not in the alternative, as insisted by appellant, inasmuch as the words \u201cdealer\u201d and \u201ckeeper\u201d are synonymous, and in the manner here used mean the same thing. However, we would suggest that the disjunctive \u201cor\u201d should not be used in the indictment in either instance. In view of the fact that the prosecution was based upon the first clause of the indictment, which, in our opinion, is good, and not upon the sale of whisky, as stated in the last clause, we do not deem it necessary to pass upon the validity of the last clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-5\">Appellant complains of the following portion of the court\u2019s charge, given at the instance of the State: \u201cIf you believe, from the evidence, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the defendant on the 23d day of November, that day being Sunday, or upon any Other Sunday prior to and within two years before said date, did permit his saloon to be open for the purpose of traffic, you will return a verdict of guilty and assess his punishment at a fine of not less than twenty nor more than fifty dollars; and in this connection you are further instructed that if the said defendant did permit -his saloon to be open on any Sunday within the period named above, and did then and there sell beer, or any other malt liquor, to any&lt; person whomsoever, he is guilty of permitting his saloon to be open for the purpose of traffic.\u201d Appellant insists that this charge is upon the weight of the evidence, and also that it is erroneous,'in that it permits the jury to convict defendant for any time prior to November 23, 1902, the day alleged in the indictment, instead of two years prior to December 17, 1902, the date of the filing of the indictment. This last contention is correct. The charge is also on the weight of the evidence. But in view of the evidence before us, we do not think either of these errors were calculated to injure the rights of appellant, and under article 723, Code of Criminal Procedure, we are not authorized to reverse, unless it is so made to appear. There is no positive evidence from any witness that any sales were made, except in the fall of 1902. Nor is there any evidence controverting the fact that the saloon was kept open for business at that time. In view of the testimony, we do not see how the charge could have injured the rights of appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-6\">At the instance of the State, the court also gave this charge to the jury: \u201cIf you believe, from the evidence, beyond a reasonable doubt, that defendant did permit his saloon to be open on Sunday for the purposes of traffic within two years prior to November 23, 1902, you must return a verdict of guilty, even though said defendant did have a board<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>ing house or hotel open at the same time.\u201d This charge presents a cor- . rect rule of law subject to the criticism above stated.</p>\n<headnotes id=\"b144-5\">[Appellant\u2019s motion for rehearing was overruled without a written opinion.\u2014Reporter. ]</headnotes>\n<p id=\"b144-3\">Ho reversible error appearing in the record, the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-4\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
