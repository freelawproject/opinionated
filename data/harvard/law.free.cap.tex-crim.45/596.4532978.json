A. Allison \u201cdid then and there unlawfully <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>and corruptly offer to bribe and did bribe John Shipp, who was then and there a qualified voter at a primary election, and did then and there unlawfully, wilfully and corruptly offer to give and did give to said John Shipp the sum of three dollars, in money (lawful and current money of the \"[Tinted States of America) for the purpose of influencing the said John Shipp at such election to vote and cast his vote at such election for E. E. Prince, who was then and there a candidate for the office of Congress. The said primary election being authorized by law, and being a primary election held by authority of the Democratic party on the 14th day of June, 1903, in all election precincts in Limestone County, for the purpose of nominating a candidate for Congress,\u201d etc. Appellant made a motion to quash the indictment on the ground that there is no such office as \"Congress\u201d known to the law. In ordinary parlance, where a candidate is elected as the representative of the people of a district of a State to Congress, he is known and designated as congressman, or a ' candidate for Congress while running. But in law there is no such office as \"Congress.\u201d Nor can an election be held to elect a candidate for the office of Congress. Article 1, section 3, of the Constitution of the United States designates the office as \"representative,\u201d and hence the election was held to elect a nominee for \"representative to the Congress of the United States.\u201d We can not indulge presumptions to aid an indictment. The indictment must be drawn with legal accuracy and express the exact legal status of the position that the person seeks. It follows, therefore, that the indictment is defective in the particular pointed out. The judgment is reversed and the prosecution ordered dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-5\">\n<em>jReversed and dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
