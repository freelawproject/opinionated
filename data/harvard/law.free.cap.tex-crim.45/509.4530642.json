The facts show that appellant was engaged in the business of selling whisky upon prescriptions of physicians in the town of Greenville, Hunt County, under a license taken out for that purpose; and that he sold on December 1, 1902, on a prescription, one quart of whisky. The prescription was regular on its face, etc. In addition to this he only sold patent medicine and pills. It is contended that the evidence does not show a violation of the statute. This contention is correct. The statute under which he was indicted has no application to this sort of case. In the sale of whisky upon prescription it is not necessary to compound any medicines or drugs, nor was this law ever intended to apply to such, character of sales on prescription. The judgment is reversed and cause remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-7\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
