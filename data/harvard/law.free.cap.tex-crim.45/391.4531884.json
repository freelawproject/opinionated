Among other things, appellant excepted to the charge of the court defining a deadly weapon \u201cas a gun used as a firearm within carrying distance.\u201d As applied to the facts of this case, there was no error in this charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-7\">Nor did the court err in defining an assault.

There is no testimony authorizing a charge on this subject. The evidence shows that, at prosecutor Bolton\u2019s request, defendant had agreed to accompany him to Bolton\u2019s house to.confront his wife, whom Bolton alleged defendant had attempted to debauch, and there explain and settle the matter; and that on the way appellant, who was armed, dropped behind and, at close range, discharged his gun at him, powder burning his neck and face. There is no testimony traversing this evidence. The court fairly submitted all the issues arising under the evidence, and the charge is not subject to the criticisms mentioned or others invoked by appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-9\">Nor is there anything in appellant\u2019s application for new trial based on newly discovered testimony.
