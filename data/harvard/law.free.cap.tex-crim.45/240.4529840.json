The court submitted the case alone upon the counts for receiving, and the penalty assessed by the jury was two years confinement in the penitentiary.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-21\">Among other things, reversal is sought on account of the misconduct of the jury. In support of this is filed the affidavits of W. L. Stewart and B. L. Denio. Upon the trial of the motion, Sullivan testified that he was a juror who tried appellant; that after the retirement of the jury and while deliberating upon the case, some one stated that he would not believe the evidence of John Hankins. Hankins was the principal State\u2019s witness and a particeps eriminis: The juror stated that Hankins was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>just as credible and worthy of belief as Bradford Mitchell, who had been recently acquitted by a jury for participating in this offense. This juror stated that Mitchell had sworn that Tom Bussell sold the gray mare or filley to a man named Exorne. Tom Bussell was also connected with this transaction as a guilty participant. Witness further stated that he informed the jury that Exorne told him and his family that he bought the gray mare or filley from Bradford Mitchell and paid him six or eight dollars for it; that Exorne started to leave the country with said animal, having also in possession the saddle of the son of the juror; that at Walnut Springs, he, Exorne, tried to sell the horse and saddle, and referred the party to the juror to ascertain if the title was good; that a phone message came while this juror was acting as grand juror. As the phone message came to the courthouse, the juror met his son Will and got him to answer the phone; that his son told the party at Walnut Springs that Exorne had not paid for the mare and the saddle belonged to him, that is, witness\u2019 son. At the time these statements were made the jury were discussing the credibility of the witnesses, especially Hankins and Bradford Mitchell; and at said time they had not agreed upon a verdict, but subsequently did agree to a conviction. This discussion occurred about midnight. They agreed upon the verdict about 9 or 10 o\u2019clock the following morning. When the jury first went out they stood nine for conviction and three for acquittal; and before retiring for the night all had agreed to conviction but George Edmonston, who agreed the following morning, about 9 or 10 o\u2019clock. This witness favored giving appellant five years.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-3\">Watterson was also one of the jurors who convicted appellant. Stewart\u2019s affidavit states that while he was talking to Glass, on the public square in Glen Bose, juror Watterson approached affiant and Glass, who was also a juror in attendance upon the court, and just prior to the calling of appellant\u2019s case, stated to Glass, in affiant\u2019s presence, \u201cthat we (meaning himself and Glass) had just as well go home, as they (meaning appellant and his counsel) would not take either of them upon the jury (meaning appellant\u2019s jury), as they knew too much about us (the jurors); that they knew he and Glass would convict Pete Williams, and that by God, we would send them up\u201d (meaning Pete Williams and the other parties indicted for the theft of the same horses for which Williams was indicted). But this information was not communicated to appellant nor his counsel, nor any of his friends, until after Watterson had been impaneled, etc. Watterson was used as a witness on the hearing of the motion for new trial, and admitted making the statements imputed to him, but said he was joking, and that he knew nothing about the facts and had no prejudice against defendant. The affidavit of Denio attacks the juror Bryan, to the effect that Bryan stated, that \u201cIf they let me sit on that case I will hang them darned horse thieves;\u201d and said to affiant, \u201cWouldn\u2019t you?\u201d And affiant said \u201cHo; they would have to prove the boys guilty [meaning Tom Bussell, Bradford Mitchell and Pete Williams] before I would convict them, as I would go according to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>law and evidence.\u201d Mr. Bryan said that he did not have any use for the horse-thieves. <em>\u201cI </em>said I didn\u2019t care if a man was a horse-thief, I would not convict him unless he was proven guilty.\u201d Mr. Bryan then said that of course \u2018die would try to go according to the law and the evidence.\u201d That these matters were not communicated to defendant or his counsel, etc. This conversation was denied by Bryan. However, Bryan corroborated that portion of the motion for new trial in regard to the statements to Sullivan. There is some other evidence in regard to the juror Thompson. We have stated enough to demonstrate the misconduct of the jury, and for which this judgment must be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-3\">\u25a0 There are several bills of exception with reference to the rulings of the court in the admission of testimony, involving the statements of the different parties who were shown by the witness Hankins to be particeps criminis in the transaction detailed by his testimony. Hankins states that he was employed by appellant, Mitchell and Sullivan to go to Black Stump Valley, in Eratli County, and drive from that point to Somervell County, the five horses claimed by them; that he undertook to drive them, and made a failure; that he secured the services of his brother Jim to assist him; that the horses were finally driven as far as the pasture of the witness Ham, and placed in pasture for a few days; that the parties mentioned by him, including defendant, accompanied by himself, went to\u201dthis point, drove the horses and put them in the pen of one Davis, where there was a trade entered into, which Hankins says was a sham, by which a bill of sale was to be executed by him in favor of Tom Bussell, one of the parties to the original employment; that he (Hankins) was to get one-half of the horses for driving them from Black Stump Valley; that the horses were then driven away from Davis\u2019 pen, and put into appellant\u2019s pasture, at least \"some of them were; Hankins receiving one of the animals, which he traded to his brother, and a note for $40, executed by Tom Bussell, appellant and Bradford Mitchell. The bill of sale was executed in favor of Tom Bussell, as agreed upon. The note and bill of sale were read in evidence, and are incorporated in the record. Appellant introduced both instruments. The trade spoken of is testified to by several of appellant\u2019s witnesses as having occurred, among others, by appellant himself, as well as Bradford Mitchell. They denied, however, any complicity in the criminal part of the transaction, claiming innocence in their connection with it. Without going into detail as to the statements admitted over objection by the different witnesses, it is sufficient to say that, in our opinion, a proper predicate was laid; that is, sufficient evidence was introduced to justify the court in admitting these declarations on the theory of conspiracy between the parties. It is necessary to make this statement because -appellant denied hearing some of said statements. Though the State shows that most of them were made in such juxtaposition to appellant that he could have heard them, as he was present with the parties at the time they were made, and much of it was directly in connection with handling the horses at the pen of the witness Davis and subsequently. These statements <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>were somewhat of a criminative nature and character. We think these bills, explained by the court, rendered the testimony admissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-5\">Will Williams, while testifying in behalf of appellant, states that on the 11th or 12th of August, he prepared the bill of sale executed bj&lt; Hankins, conveying to Bussell the horses in question; that he remembered the circumstances of Bradford Mitchell, Tom Bussell and appellant bringing the horses in controversy to their homes about that time; that he saw defendant for the first time after he brought the horses to his home, about a day or two after he had gotten them, and that he then asked defendant about said horses, and from whom and where he had gotten them. The witness was then asked by appellant\u2019s counsel, to detail the statements of defendant to him about his possession of the horses and from whom and where he had gotten them. State\u2019s counsel objected to this testimony because it would be self serving and hearsay; and said counsel, in response to an inquiry form the court, stated that his purpose in offering ishe testimony was to show that defendant\u2019s explanation of his possession of the horses. The court sustained the objection, ami the witness was not permitted to detail said statements of appellant. The witness would have testified that the first time he saw defendant, which was a day or two after he (appellant), Bradford Mitchell and Tom Bussell brought the horses in controversy to appellant\u2019s home, and on the day the witness prepared the bill of sale from Hankins to Bussell, which was the 11th or 12th of August, 1902, that defendant told him, in answer to his (witness\u2019) question as to how, where and from whom he came into possession of the horses, that John Hankins told him in Glen Bose on Saturday, August 9, 1902, that he had' some horses in old man Ham\u2019s pasture, and wanted to trade them to him (appellant) for a buggy; that defendant, Bradford Mitchell and Tom Bussell went to Ham\u2019s place on Sunday, August 10, 1902, by agreement with witness Hankins to look at the horses, and if the same suited appellant, he would trade his buggy for them; that after he got there and saw said horses, he refused to trade for the same, and that subsequently Tom Bus-sell bought three head of horses that were in Williams\u2019 pasture, and the one that had already been placed in this pasture, from said Hankins, for the sum of $40; that Bussell agreed to give Hankins his note therefor for $40, with defendant and Bradford Mitchell as sureties; that Hankins said he was willing to take Bussell\u2019s note for said horses, provided he would make it secure, so that he could trade it for the buggy; and that appellant and Bradford Mitchell agreed to sign said note for the purpose of making the same secure, so that Hankins could trade it for the buggy. The court signs this bill with the explanation that the bill of sale was exhibited to the witness, and he stated that he wrote it on said occasion, and it recited the sale of horses from Hankins to Bussell; and it was further admitted in evidence that the note given was also admitted in evidence and Hankins admitted signing the bill of sale and accepting the note. And he further qualifies the bill by stating that the evidence of the witness Davis shows tliat defendant\u2019s possession of the horses <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>was first questioned at his (Davis\u2019) house, in Somervell County, before\u00bb they got them to Hood County, and two or three days before this conversation should have occurred. Under the explanation of the court, the ruling was correct. If appellant was called upon at Davis\u2019 to explain possession of the horses, this preceded the conversation sought to be introduced through Will Williams; but whether this is true or not, it was a fact, not denied by the State and proved by appellant, that the matters occurred as sought to be testified by Williams. Why the State should have objected to this testimony is not easily explained, because it was the theory of the State in regard to this phase of the case that the sale was a sham and a fraud, and the bill of sale and note were executed to carry out this idea, and to cover up, as best they could by this means, the fraudulent transaction with a glamour of innocence. While we do not see .any particular injury that could accrue to appellant, yet, upon another trial, it might be well enough to let this testimony go to the jury for what it would be worth.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-5\">The judgment is reversed and the cause remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-6\">\n<em>Reversed amd remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
