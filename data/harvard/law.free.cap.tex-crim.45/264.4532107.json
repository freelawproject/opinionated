Such a charge is upon the weight of evidence, which instructed the jury, in effect, that such evidence -was to be, considered by them together with the other testimony, and to be given such weight as, upon consideration of the entire testimony, they might deem the same entitled to in determining defendant\u2019s motive, and for no other purpose; and that such testimony could not be considered as affecting defendant\u2019s right of self-defense.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b288-18\">5. \u2014Same\u2014Charge\u2014Apparent Danger\u2014Self-Defense.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b288-19\">A charge upon self-defense based upon apparent danger is necessary where deceased made an attack upon defendant, or defendant believed he was about to make an attack upon him threatening his life or serious bodily injury. ,</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b289-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>6.\u2014Same\u2014Manslaughter.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b289-3\">On a trial for murder, a charge upon manslaughter is not required where there is no evidence presenting that issue.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"history\" id=\"b289-4\">Appeal from the District Court of Walker, on a change of venue from Trinity County.

Otho Oldacre jointly with the murder of J. M. Gary, in Trinity County, on the 17th day of July, 1902, by shooting him with a gun. The killing occurred in the town of Groveton, and after midnight. Gary, the deceased, was a practicing physician, and at the time he was killed was in company with one L. B. Eagle, who had gone for him to come and attend a man who had been shot at the Sylvan Hotel. Eagle was also killed at the same time and place as was Dr. Gary.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b289-7\">By a separate indictment these same parties, appellant, Magee and Oldacre, had also been jointly indicted in Trinity County for the murder of Eagle. A severance was had in the case for the murder of Gary, and Howard Magee had been separately tried and acquitted of that murder. When this case was called for trial against Wright Terry, this defendant, he made another motion for severance from his codefendant Howard Magee, in the case for the murder of Eagle, so that defendant might have the benefit of his, Magee\u2019s, testimony in the case untrammeled by his being under indictment in said latter case. This motion was overruled.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b289-8\">Late on the night of the killing Wright Terry and Howard Magee and Otho Oldacre were together. They borrowed a Winchester and a double-barreled shotgun and procured ammunition and loaded the guns and started out, for what purpose the record does not disclose. Shortly afterwards they were seen in the rear of the Sylvan Hotel. Here, it seems, they got into a wordy altercation with Eagle, who was a guest, and who hollooed to them from the inside of the hotel. They cursed him and commenced firing into the hotel. They fired a number of shots into the house and wounded a guest in the house by the name of Williams. Eagle went for Dr. Gary to come and see the wounded man Williams, but returned without the doctor. Partlow, another guest, then went for the doctor and found him. In the meantime Eagle again started out for the doctor. In going from the hotel to the doctor\u2019s office,\u201d the nearest way was through an alley in the rear of the Sylvan Hotel. The defendant and his comrade were in this alley. When Eagle came up to where they were, in answer to their questions as to where he was going, he told them he was going after a doctor to see the wounded man. About this time, Dr. Gary approached from the other direction on his way to the hotel. Defendant testified that he became alarmed at the actions and movements of the parties\u2014thought they were going to disarm and shoot him\u2014and that he fired first at Eagle and then at Dr. Gary, killing them both.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b290-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>Defendant\u2019s testimony that he asked Eagle where he was going, and he replied that he was going for a doctor. \u201cI told him to go get <em>one; </em>that I was no doctor. He got up pretty close to me and tried to get hold of my gun, and Howard and Oldacre went down the alley. He tried to get up close to me and tried to get hold of my gun, and Howard and Oldacre went down the alley. He tried to get up close to me and I told him to go on and let me alone. I told him to go on and- get a doctor, and he turned one way and I turned the other down the alley. When we turned we turned our backs together, and I thought he was gone. He turned back on me and I heard the footsteps. I looked around-and he was right on me, and I brought my gun down and shoved him off. I gave him a good shove and he went some ways into the main street. I raised my gun and told him to leave. He started towards the comer of the millinery store, and I went down the side of the market. Then he turned down the side of the millinery store and was about two feet behind me. I was on one side of the alley and he was on the other. I got down by the willow tree and stopped. He went on about fifteen or twenty feet through the alley in the direction of the Sylvan Hotel. He stopped and looked around, and I asked him where he was going; he said he was going for a doctor for a man who was shot in the Sylvan Hotel. He got closer to me, and I told him I did not know anything about him and did not want to hurt him, but to let me alone and let my gun alone. About this time I heard another man coming up and heard him coming up behind me. I backed out north up toward the printing office. When this other man got up to me I asked him who it was and he said nothing, and Eagle says, \u2018That is Dr. Gary,\u2019 and Dr. Gary says, \u2018He lmows who it is.\u2019 Then about that time when I asked who it was the other boys ran, Otho behind the fence and Magee across the alley behind a willow tree. This last man, Gary, was going in the direction of the Sylvan Hotel when I first saw him. This other man, Eagle, was on my right and Gary on my left. I thought they wanted to do something to me and I had no way to run. Gary came and I told him to stop; he raised his hands. Gary turned out of the path and started towards me, and the other man came on from the other side. I thought they were going to kill me, so I shot Gary first, then turned and shot Eagle. He was coming on me when I shot him. I did not know him, had never seen him before. I did not have any bad feeling towards Gary.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b290-5\">The State made an effort to show that defendant shot Gary because the doctor was a witness against him in a case pending against him for the murder of one Less Washburne. This is a brief but- sufficient statement of the essential facts in the case. The other matters discussed will be fully understood from the opinion.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b290-6\"><em>Stevenson &amp; Stevenson, Kenley &amp; Stevenson,.

Rep., 395.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b293-7\"><em>Howard </em>Martin, Assistant Attorney-General, for the State.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b293-8\">BROOKS, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"AVg\">Appellant was convicted of murder in the first degree, and his punishment assessed at confinement in the penitentiary for life. Appellant, Howard Magee and Otho Oldacre were jointly indicted in Trinity County for the murder of Dr. J. M. Gary. Otho Old-acre was not arrested. The venue was changed to the District Court of Walker by the court of its own motion, because appellant was related to numerous prominent and influential citizens in Trinity County, and this would preclude the State securing a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-9\">Appellant filed a motion to dismiss the case in Walker County because the venue was changed, and the District Court of Walker County had no jurisdiction to try it. In his motion he alleges that the indictment charged that said offense was committed by Wright Terry, Howard Magee and Otho Oldacre; that said cause was entitled by the indictment, \u201cState of Texas v. Wright Terry, Howard Magee and Otho Oldacre, defendants,\u201d and was numbered 1981 on the docket of the District Court of Trinity County; that there is nothing to show that these defendants, Wright Terry and Howard Magee, or either of them, severed from Otho Oldacre, or that any disposition was ever made of said case pending against said Oldacre, or that such a case as the one at bar ever existed in Trinity County, or was ever transferred to Walker County from Trinity County.</p>\n<p id=\"AtA\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>The district attorney controverted\" appellant\u2019s motion to dismiss, alleging that the indictment is one and the same as that found in.Trinity County, and that Otho Oldacre has never been arrested. This last statement is sworn to by the sheriff of Trinity County. It seems that appellant\u2019s motion is predicated solely upon the contention that the case was not transferred so far as Otho Oldacre was concerned.' There is no insistence to the effect that it is not one and the same indictment as that found by the grand jury of Trinity County. The judgment of the court changing the venue from Trinity to Walker County shows that Wright Terry and Howard Magee were then in custody. The court did not err in refusing to sustain the motion to dismiss the indictment. It appears that it had been properly transferred to Walker County. The mere fact that there was no transfer so far as Otho Oldacre was concerned, would not vitiate the order changing the venue. In Stevens v. State, <em>42 </em>Texas Crim. Rep., 168, we held that the failure to transfer the case, so far as a part of the codefendants were concerned, would not invalidate the transfer as to the others. It appears by the first bill of exceptions that all the papers relating to the case of the State of Texas v. Wright Terry and Howard Magee were duly transferred to the District Court of Walker County, and are the identical indictment and other .papers on file herein.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">Appellant made a motion for severance, and asked the court to place Howard Magee on trial first. The motion is embodied in a bill of exceptions, and is substantially as follows: Appellant asked that Howard Magee be placed on trial in cause No. 6309, then pending, and that this defendant be not compelled to go to trial before the trial of said cause No. 6309. The court overruled the motion. Attached to the bill is the following explanation: \u201cThat Howard Magee had been tried in cause Ho. 6308, in which defendant Wright Terry was tried, charged with the murder of J. M. Gary, and that said Magee had been acquitted of said offense on a former day of said term, and'was then in custody of the sheriff of this county and in the jail of this county charged jointly with defendant with the murder of L. B. Eagle, in said cause Ho. 6309, and that defendant or his counsel made no application or request to have said Magee brought into court to testify in behalf of defendant in this cause (Ho. 6309), which request, if it had been made, would have been granted by the court and said Magee would have been allowed to testify in behalf of defendant in said cause. Further, on call of cause No. 6308, State of Texas v. Wright Terry et al., defendant Terry presented his motion for a severance in said case, and asked that Magee be put to trial first, in order that he might have the benefit of Magee\u2019s testimony in his behalf on his trial of said cause, which motion was sustained by the court and Magee tried and acquitted in said cause Ho. 6308.\u201d It appears that Magee and appellant were jointly indicted for the killing of Gary, and also jointly indicted for the killing of Eagle. Magee, upon proper motion by appellant, was first tried and acquitted for the killing of Gary. How appellant makes a motion to have Magee <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>also tried for the killing of Eagle, before he (appellant) should be tried at all.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-5\">The court erred in refusing this motion. Article 706 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, provides: \u201cWhen two or more defendants are jointly prosecuted they may sever in the erial upon the request of either.\u201d Article 707 of the Code of Criminal Procedure reads: \u201cWhere two or more defendants are prosecuted for an offense growing out of the same transaction, by separate indictments, either defendant may file his affidavit in writing that one or more parties are indicted for an offense growing out of the same transaction for which he is indicted, and that the evidence of such party or parties is material for the defense of the affiant, and that the affiant verily believes that there is not sufficient evidence against the party or parties,\u201d etc. As we understand the bill of exceptions Magee and appellant were indicted for one and the same transaction; for though two different killings still it is one and the same transaction. The court should have granted the motion for severance, and placed Magee upon trial for the killing of Eagle, prior to the calling of appellant\u2019s case.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-7\">Appellant also complains\" that the court erred in permitting the witness Guy Wilbourn to testify about appellant procuring arms prior to the difficulty, and also that the court erred in permitting witness Earnest Mangum to testify to the purchase of ammunition. Also that, the court erred in permitting witness Lige Pruitt to testify to appellant procuring arms. And also permitting witness C. A. Dean to testify that appellant shot into the Sylvan Hotel, and that he was seen immediately back of said hotel. He further complains that the court erred in permitting the witness G. W. Williams to testify about appellant shooting into the hotel. He also objects to the court forcing appellant to testify that on the night of the alleged killing of Dr. Gary he came to town without a gun; that he procured a gun from Wilbourn, and another from Pruitt, and ammunition from Mangum, and went to a little barn and fired into the Sylvan Hotel -six or eight times, and that Howard Magee fired some shots into said hotel. All of this testimony appellant insists is not admissible on the ground that it is proof of extraneous crimes, in no way showing an intent on the part of appellant to kill Dr. Gary; nor was it a part of the res gestae; nor did it serve to identify defendant with the killing of Dr. Gary. We think this testimony was admissible. It appears that appellant Magee and Otho Old-acre were together some time near <em>12 </em>o\u2019clock at night, and after securing a shotgun and Winchesters, and buying ammunition, were seen immediately back of the Sylvan Hotel, where they had some heated words with deceased Eagle. A short while afterwards they fired their guns into the hotel, wounding an'inmate thereof, Immediately thereafter Eagle left the hotel, and went a short distance for a physician. Appellant and his companions were sitting near the hotel in the dark. In about ten or fifteen minutes after said shooting, according to the testimony of appellant, Eagle' returned, going in the direction of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>hotel, accompanied by Dr. Gary. The State\u2019s testimony shows that Dr. Gary informed defendant and his companions who he was, and without an/ provocation, appellant shot Dr. Gary, and then shot Eagle, killing both. Appellant\u2019s theory is that he thought Eagle and Gary intended to hurt him, and that he shot in self-defense. The whole transaction appears to have occurred within a short while, and all the antecedent acts complained of in the above bills served strongly to illustrate and make manifest the cruelty and wanton motive prompting appellant and his companions, and are so interwoven and connected with the killing for which he was being tried, that they become part and parcel thereof, and res gestae of the transaction. Leeper &amp; Powell v. State, 29 Texas Crim. App., 69; McKinney v. State, 8 Texas Crim. App., 645. However, appellant insists that McAnally v. State, 7 Texas Ct. Rep., 398; Walker v. State, 7 Texas Ct. Rep., 394; Hill v. State, 7 Texas Ct. Rep., 389, sustain his contention. We do not think so. It is clearly held by this court that extraneous crimes illustrating the motive, intent and identity of appellant are admissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-5\">Appellant complains of the following portion of the court\u2019s charge: \"'You are instructed that the testimony admitted before you regarding the procurement of arms by defendant and other parties, the occurrence at the Sylvan Hotel before the procurement of arms, and the occurrence at said hotel after said procurement of arms, is admitted before you to be considered by you together with the other testimony in this ease, and to be given such weight as, upon a consideration of the entire testimony, you may deem the same entitled to, as a circumstance in determining whether or not defendant had a motive at said time and place in killing J. M. Gary, deceased, a^d for no other purpose whatever, and under no circumstances will said testimony be considered by you as affecting the defendant\u2019s right of self-defense, if you shall believe that the defendant was acting in self-defense in the killing of said J. M. Gary at the time and place of said killing.\u201d This and similar charges complained of by appellant were clearly upon the weight of evidence, and the court erred in giving such charges. Walker v. State, 7 Texas Ct. Rep., 395; Hudson v. State, 28 Texas Crim. App., 324; Attaway v. State, 41 Texas Crim. Rep., 395, 55 S. W. Rep., 45. These authorities hold that it is not necessary to charge on motive. However, it does become the duty .of the court, wherever extraneous crimes are introduced on a controverted question of intent, .to limit the same to that purpose. For collation of authorities, see White\u2019s Ann. C. C. P., p. 529. But where another crime forms part and parcel of the motive and res gestae of the motive, it is not proper to charge on the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-6\">In this connection, appellant complains that the court erred in permitting the State to prove that Dr. Gary was a witness against appellant in another homicide. This evidence is admissible, if it should appear that said defendant knew said fact; but if knowledge is not brought home to defendant, then said testimony is not admissible. However, this can <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>'be done- under the usual rules of evidence, either by positive or circumstantial testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-5\">Appellant also complains that the court erred in refusing to charge on apparent danger. The court properly presented the law of actual attack, but failed to present the law of apparent danger.
