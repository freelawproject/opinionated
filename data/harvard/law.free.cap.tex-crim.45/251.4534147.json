This phase of the case as made by the evidence was not covered by the court\u2019s general charge, hence this special charge so requested or a similar one setting forth this phase of the case should have been given.

The theory of the defense being that the defendant had the permission of the alleged owner of the horse to use the horse as if it was defendant\u2019s horse, and there being evidence before the jury tending to show this to be the fact, the court should have instructed the jury that the fraudulent intent of the defendant, if any, must have existed in his mind at the time he sold the horse.

He received the horse in Victoria County, rode it into De Witt County, and there disposed of it. His defensive theory was that he had permission of the owner to dispose of the horse. Exception was reserved to the charge because it failed to instruct the jury that the fraudulent intent in converting the property was necessary to the conviction. An inspection of the charge sustains this contention. After charging the jury with reference to the necessary possesion of defendant by virtue of the contract of borrowing, the court informed the jury: \u201cAnd you further believe that defendant converted said horse to his, defendant\u2019s own use without the consent of the said Eugene Porter, with the intent to deprive the said Eugene Porter of the value of said horse, then you will Hnd defendant guilty,\u201d etc. The fraudulent conversion of the horse is a necessary element to constitute this crime, and without it there would be no offense, and the jury should have been so informed. This omission is fatal and requires a reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-8\">Exception was reserved to this section of the charge, to wit: \u201cIf you believe from the evidence that said Eugene Porter authorized or gave his permission or consent to defendant to sell or otherwise dispose of said horse, or if you have a reasonable doubt thereof, you will acquit defendant.\u201d It is contended this changes the reasonable doubt, and places the burden upon the accused. We do not so understand it. If the owner gave appellant his authority or permission to sell, or in any manner dispose of the horse, this would meet the contention of the State that the conversion was fraudulent. How, if there was a reasonable doubt of this, then appellant was entitled to an acquittal; and, as we understand this charge, it gave this phase of the law in accordance with our statutory provisions. We do not understand how a reasonable doubt of an authority would throw the burden on appellant, when the jury are informed .if there was such reasonable doubt, they should acquit. If the jury had been informed that, in case they had a reasonable doubt of the fact of consent or permission to dispose of the horse they would convict, appellant\u2019s contention would be correct. But such is not the charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-9\">For the error indicated, the judgment is reversed'and the cause remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-10\">\n<em>Reversed and rem.ande,d.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
