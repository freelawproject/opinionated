The conditions of the bond appear to comply with article 889, Acts Twenty-seventh Legislature, page 291, except that the sureties bind themselves to pay the sum of forty dollars. The statute provides that said bond \"shall not in any case be for a less sum that fifty dollars.\u201d This is a statutory requisite, and the bond executed under it must comply with the statute. Appellant insists that it is an appearance bond, and that he should be permitted to execute a new bond. While it is true it is an appearance bond, still the bond must be executed at the time of the perfecting of the appeal, and in the terms of the law. Accordingly we hold that the county court did not err in dismissing appellant\u2019s appeal. The judg-, ment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-10\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
