The Assistant Attorney-General moves to dismiss- the appeal because the recognizance does not comply with article 887, Code Crim. Proc; First, it does not state that appellant was convicted of a misdemeanor \u201cin this cause,\u201d and it is not made to appear in what <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>cause he was convicted; second, it is more onerous than the law provides, in that it requires him to make his \u201cpersonal\u201d appearance; third, because it states \u201cuntil discharged by due course of law,\u201d instead of \u201cnot depart without leave of this court.\u201d The form of recognizance prescribed by article 887 is plain and simple, and we have repeatedly held that it should be complied with. The motion is well taken. Meeks v. State, 7 Texas Ct. Rep., 824. The appeal is accordingly dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-5\">\n<em>Appeal dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
