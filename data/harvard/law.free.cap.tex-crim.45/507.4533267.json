He has attempted to appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeals by giving recognizance. The Assistant Attorney-General has filed a motion to dismiss the appeal-because the amount of the fine in the county court was less than one hundred dollars, and consequently the judgment of the county court was final. The motion is well taken. Article 4, section 16, Constitution, prescribes the jurisdiction of the county court; and the Legislature by the acts of 1892, page 37, section 25 provides: \u201cThe preceding section shall not be so construed as to embrace eases which have been appealed from justices\u2019, mayors\u2019 or other inferior courts, to the county court, and in which the- judgment rendered or fine imposed by the county court shall not exceed one hundred dollars, exclusive of cost. In such cases, the judgment of the county court shall be final.\u201d See also Nelson v. State, 33 Texas Crim. Rep., 379. The appeal is accordingly dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-7\">\n<em>Dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
