As soon as the set was finished witness went to appellant, who was talking with Wheeler Dennis, and touched him on the shoulder and requested an interview. They went off some twenty feet in front of the house in the yard. Upon reaching that point witness turned and asked appellant what he meant by his remark in the house, and he replied that he meant just what he said; that he was going to kill witness, and at once began cutting him with a knife. He then describes the further progress of the difficulty and the cuts inflicted; that they fell to the ground, he on top of- appellant, and \u201cI finally called for some one to part us, when .Hamby and Buchanan came up and parted us.\u201d There had been no previous difficulty between the parties according to this witness. Witness weighed 160 pounds, and was 28 years of age; while appellant was 17 years of age, and weighed about 130 pounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-9\">Hamby was at the party and was in the yard, some fifteen steps .from the house, talking with Buchanan, when appellant and Dennis came-out of the house, and stopped about ten feet from where witness was standing. Witness heard one of them say something, but did not .understand what it was. He immediately heard a blow and the two men began fighting. They fell to the ground, and witness went up and found Dennis, the injured party, on top of appellant, and he tried to pull him off but could not. Witness stepped back and heard defendant say, \u201cYou are too big for me to fight; if you don\u2019t quit choking me I will cut your God-damned guts out.\u201d Defendant\u2019s voice sounded like he was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>being choked or smothered. \u201cDirectly T heard Dennis say, Tull him off, boys; he is cutting me all to pieces/ \u201d Buchanan and witness then separated them. When Dennis got up he said, \u201cWhere is my pistol? I will kill the son of a bitch.\u201d Dennis further remarked, when he got in the house, \u201cI had my thumb in the hollow place in Drake\u2019s throat, and was trying to choke him to death, but could not do it.\u201d Buchanan testified substantially as did the former witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-3\">Appellant\u2019s theory of the difficulty is directly in conflict with the testimony of Dennis. He says that just before the difficulty he was standing at the door talking to Wheeler Dennis. Oscar Dennis came up and touched him with his hand, and said, \u201cCome out, I want to see you.\u201d That they had gone about twenty feet when Dennis turned, facing defendant, and said, \u201cYou damned son of a bitch, I am going to fix you.\u201d He then struck me on the side of my face with his fist, and grabbed me. He.threw me down; he fell on top, and began choking me. I told him if -he did not quit I would cut his God-damhed guts out. Defendant further testified that Dennis continued choking him, and he finally succeeded in getting his knife'out and cut him until Dennis was pulled off. He flatly denied making the statement imputed to him in the house.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-4\">Charging on self-defense, the court in every instance qualified this issue with a charge on provoking the difficulty. There were five charges on this issue given by the court in the main charge, and each qualified or limited by a charge on provoking the difficulty. Exception was reserved to these charges, which we think are well taken. Perhaps the court was justified in charging on the issue of provoking the difficulty, but it is unquestionably correct that appellant had a right under the law to a clear and unequivocal charge on self-defense. Appellant and his witnesses make a clear case of self-defense, one that required a charge untrammeled by any limitations or qualifications.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-5\">Hpon another trial, if the court should charge upon the issue of provoking the difficulty, it should not be so charged as to limit appellant\u2019s (right of self-defense, because under his view of the case there was absolutely no provocation, but his opponent was in the wrong and was the aggressor from the beginning. The remaining errors will not occur upon another trial.</p>\n<p id=\"AHM\">For the errors discussed, the judgment is reversed and the cause remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-8\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b299-9\">BROOKS, Judge</author>\n<p id=\"AD3\">(Dissenting.)\u2014I do not agree with the opinion of the majority. I think the issue of provoking the difficulty is clearly presented by the facts. To give an unqualified charge on self-defense, as suggested by the majority, would be a contradiction of the charge on provoking the difficulty. In every state of facts presenting the issue of provoking the difficulty, the injured party is necessarily the aggressor; that is, A. provokes the difficulty, B. makes an overt act or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>an assault against A., and A. shoots to protect himself against such assault or attempted assault. A. insists under his evidence that he shot in self-defense. \u00a1Now, an unqualified -charge, stating in substance that if A. shot in self-defense he would not be guilty, would be a contradiction of the charge on provoking the difficulty, because A. has no right under the law to shoot in self-defense if he has provoked the difficulty; and it is proper and right for the court to tell the jury what his right of self-defense is, and that said right would be perfect unless he provoked the difficulty. As stated above, in every case where a party is killed, and the State\u2019s evidence indicates that he provoked the difficulty, then this issue is presented on the theory that he brought about the necessity of shooting the deceased, and that therefore he can not claim self-defense. Hence an unqualified charge on self-defense would be directly contradictory of the charge on provoking' the difficulty. In other words, appellant can not have an unqualified right of self-defense where the evidence for the State presents the issue of provoking the difficulty. I do not mean to be understood as holding that appellant\u2019s evidence presenting the perfect right of self-defense should not be given in charge to the jury; but the court should clearly indicate to the jury that this right only exists where he did not provoke the difficulty. I understand the charges in this case clearly present these issues. As stated by the majority, the evidence for appellant presents the issue of perfect self-defense, and the evidence for the State presents the issue of provoking the difficulty. I think the charge of the court in this ease admirably presents all the law of this case so far as the objections of appellant are concerned. For the reasons indicated, I do not agree with the opinion of the majority.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
