This is the allegation in the information. However, appellant contends that the evidence fails to show that said Hose Cinnamon\u2019s private residence was commonly resorted to for the purpose of gaming. We have carefully examined the evidence, and it shows there were a number of games played at said residence, extending from a space of time from the 1st of January until the 1st of July, 1902. The witnesses say they know of six or eight times when they went to this residence and engaged in games of cards for money. Both on account of the number of parties engaged in such games, as well as the number of games played, and the space of time over which these games extended, there was unquestionably sufficient evidence to raise the issue as to whether said private residence was commonly resorted to for the purpose of gaming; and the evidence was ample to authorize the finding that it was commonly resorted to for the purpose of gaming. Wheelock v. State, 15 Texas, 264. Appellant also contends that the evidence is mot sufficient to establish that said house was a private residence. We\u00a1 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>have examined the fecord carefully in that respect, and we do not believe this point is well taken. There being no error in the record, the \u25a0\u00a1udgment is affirmed.</p>\n<headnotes id=\"b224-6\">[Appellant's motion for rehearing was overruled without a written opinion.\u2014Reporter.]</headnotes>\n<p id=\"b224-5\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
