She testified that the defendant did not shoot her, but that the gun fell and accidentally shot her, detailing just how the same occurred. The court then permitted counsel for the State to propound the following-questions to the witness,.and forced her to answer same: Q. Wasn't you before the grand jury ? A. Yes. Q. Didn't you testify there that Mrs. Lydia Barnard shot you? A. I did tell that, but you kept pulling me around and scared me, and was going to carry me to jail, is the reason I said that; I first told you the gun fell and shot me. Q. You are under the power and influence of Joe Fulton, aren't you ? A. No, sir. Q. What power has he got over you all out there, any way? A. I don't know, sir. Q. Millie, are you a married woman ? A. No, sir. Q. How many children have you? A. Four. Q. What is their color? A. They are bright colored. Q. Who is the father of your children? A. I don't know, sir. Q. Isn't Joe Fulton their father ? A. I don't know, sir. Q. Didn't you tell Mrs. Barnard that you had as much right to Joe Fulton as she did, and that you had been with him fifteen years and she only five? A. No, sir.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b92-9\">This evidence was certainly not admissible for any purpose, and could have no bearing whatever upon any issue in this case; it tended only to show supposed illicit acts by and between the witness and Joe Fulton who was also a State's witness, the defendant being in nowise connected therewith.

App., 251.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b92-10\">The court erred in permitting the prosecuting attorney, over the objections of the defendant, to propound the questions to the State's witness Millie Jackson, and to require said witness to answer said questions. And the court further erred in permitting the prosecuting attorney to cause to be read in the presence and hearing of the jury what purported to be the testimony of the said witness Millie Jackson before the grand jury; which said purported testimony contained among other things the following: \u201cFulton has been keeping me for the past fifteen years and he is the father of my four, children.\u201d For the reasons that said questions and answers related to no issue upon the trial of said cause, was upon an immaterial matter, and entirely foreign to any issue in the trial of said cause; and by the introduction of said purported testimony of said witness before the said grand jury, the prosecuting attorney was permitted to impeach his own witness upon wholly immaterial matter and in nowise' connected with this cause, and which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>tended to show the bad character of said witness Millie Jackson, which was calculated to and did prejudice the minds of the jury against this defendant.

By the third bill of exception, complaint is made that Millie Jackson was asked the following questions: \u201cAre you a married woman?\u201d To which she answered, \u201cNo.\u201d \u201cHow many children have you?\u201d To which she answered, \u201cFour.\u201d \u201cWhat is the color of those children ? Aren\u2019t they mulattoes ?\u201d To which she answered, \u201cThey are bright-colored.\u201d \u201cMillie, who is the father of your children ?\u201d To which she answered, \u201cI do not know.\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t you know that Joe Fulton is the father of your children?\u201d To which she answered, \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d \u201cDidn\u2019t you swear before the grand jury that Joe Fulton had been keeping jmu for fifteen years, and that he was the father of your children ?\u201d To which she replied, \"I said it up there because I was scared. You had been pulling me around and threatened to put me in jail.\u201d To which questions and the answers defendant objected, which objections were overruled. State\u2019s counsel then called for the grand jury statement as made by witness, and was permitted to read said testimony of Millie Jackson, \u2022 which contained, among other things, the following: \u201cFulton has been keeping me for the past fifteen years, and he is the father of my four children.\u201d To which defendant objected because said questions and answers related to no issue in the case, were upon an immaterial matter, entirely foreign to any issue; that by the introduction of the written testimony he was attempting to impeach his own witness upon immaterial matters, no way connected with the case, and which tended only to show bad character of Millie Jackson, and was calculated to prejudice and poison the minds of the jury against defendant. To this bill is appended the following explanation: \u201cWitness had been shown to be hostile to the State, and testified upon the stand that she had shot herself accidentally, and then the State was permitted to ask if she didn\u2019t testify as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>follows before the grand jury: \u2018Millie Jackson, being sworn, says: She was standing in her house last summer, about September, 1902, when Mrs. Barnard \u201ccame to my house with a gun and said she would kill me, and asked me what I was following Mr. Fulton for down at the well, and if I did not stay away from him she would fix me up. I was in the house, talking to her. I told her she had no right to shoot me about Fulton; that he was as much mine as he was hers. I was standing upon the floor with my hands down, had nothing in my hands and was doing nothing to her, was not trying to fight her, was not making any demonstration, toward her, when she shot me. She brought the gun from her house, and took it back with her. I never had the gun at my house. When she shot me she ran off with the gun towards home. When I met Fulton, and told him Mrs. Barnard had shot me, 1 did not tell him that it was an accident. 1 did not tell him that the gun fell down and shot me. He asked me why I let her shoot me, and I told him I could not help myself, and he said it was awful bad, and I said I was going to make her pay for it. He said he would just let it alone, and not have anything to do with it; that it was just one of Mrs. \u25a0Barnard\u2019s crazy spells. My girl, Lillie May, was present when I was shot, and I sent her to tell Mrs. Fulton that I was shot, and that Mrs. Barnard had shot me. Fulton has been keeping me for the past fifteen years, and he is the father of my four children,\u201d \u2019 \u201d etc.</p>\n<p id=\"A7s\">The rule in reference to this question is clearly expressed in Blake v. State, 38 Texas Crim. Rep., 385, from which we quote as follows: \u201cArticle 795 of the Code of Criminal Procedure of 1895 provides: \u2018The rule that a party introducing a witness shall not attack his testimony is so far modified as that any party, when facts stated by the witness are injurious to his cause, may attack his testimony in any other manner, except by proving the bad character of the witness.\u2019 At common law this could not be done unless the party was surprised by the testimony of his witness, or unless the party had been misled by a witness, and, when put upon the stand, testified, not in his favor, but against him. Our statute does not provide or require that the party must be surprised; but it is clear that, if the testimony of his witness is injurious to him, he can attack his testimony in any method other than proof of bad character. We are not to be understood as holding that where the party introduces a witness, knowing that the witness is going to testify against him, and without any reason to believe that the witness will testify in his favor, we would reverse the judgment because the party, under such state of facts, was deprived of the right of impeaching the witness by proof of contradictory statement. But in this case this witness, Stella McKenzie, had testified in the Harbolt case. She had sworn to facts which, if true, established an alibi for the defendant. How, the defendant had a right to believe that she would not perjure herself by swearing to facts in conflict with those <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>already testified to; and this, although she may have told him that she would so testify. It frequently occurs that a witness will deny knowing anything about a fact or a case, making an effort not to be used as a witness, but, when placed upon the stand and sworn, tells the truth. Was appellant surprised? Being informed that she had deliberately sworn to facts sustaining his alibi, would he not have been surprised if she had sworn otherwise\u2014especially to facts and circumstances disproving his alibi? We are of opinion that the court erred in not permitting this witness to be impeached.\u201d Now, reverting to the bill of exceptions under consideration, it appears from this and a previous bill, which we do not deem necessary to set out, that, at the time the State placed the witness on the stand, it had been apprised of the fact\u2014perhaps, by her own statement-\u2014that she would swear that defendant shot her; and, after placing her on the stand and being sworn, under the Blake case, supra, the prosecuting attorney could presume that, having previously sworn in behalf of the State, she would still so swear, although she may have told State\u2019s counsel that she would not. However, the bill of exceptions before us shows that the witness did not deny malting the statement imputed to her before the grand jury, but, on the contrary, with the utmost alacrity, admitted having done so. Then, for what purpose could this testimony have been introduced? We can conceive of none, except,' as appellant insists, to prejudice her rights; that is, as a criminative fact against appellant, tending to show that she fired the shot at prosecuting witness and wounded her. This testimony was not admissible for that purpose. It is a well known rule that, if a witness on cross-examination admits having made a contradictory statement to that to which she is then testifying, such admission is absolutely conclusive, and can not be proved in the face of her'admissions.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-5\">The State\u2019s witness <em>Joe </em>Fulton, while on the stand, was asked by the district attorney the following questions, over appellant\u2019s objections, to which witness replied, as stated: \u201cHow many acres of land do you own? A. 380 acres, mostly in cultivation. Don\u2019t Millie Jackson live on your place?- A. Yes; she lives between my house and Mrs. Barnard\u2019s. How many children has she? A. Four. Don\u2019t Mrs. Lydia Barnard live on your place? A. Yes. Don\u2019t you whip people out there, and make them do as you please? A. They are free people. I don\u2019t whip and control them. What is the color of Millie Jackson\u2019s children ? A. They are bright color.\u201d Appellant excepted to the asking of the questions, because illegal, irrelevant, and inadmissible; that said questions were remote and entirely foreign to any issue in the trial of Lydia Barnard for assault with intent to murder Millie Jackson; for the reason the same tended to couple defendant with witness Joe Fulton in the management of his affairs on his farm, and to develop illicit acts by and between State\u2019s witness Joe Fulton and Millie Jack<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>son, and was thereby calculated to prejudice the rights of defendant before the jury. The court appends the following explanation: \u201cIt was shown that Joe Fulton was hostile to the State, and that witness Millie Jackson was under the influence of said witness, and also to show the condition on Fulton\u2019s farm, and the relation of the women to Fulton, to show the motive for the alleged assault.\u201d Of course,..it is always permissible to prove motive for an assault, though frequently it is not necessary. It was also proper to show the condition of Fulton\u2019s farm, and the relation of the women to Fulton. But we do not understand this testimony comes within either of these rules. That Fulton whipped people on his farm would not indicate any motive on the part of appellant to shoot prosecuting witness, nor would it indicate the re-; lationship appellant bore to witness or to prosecuting witness. We do not think this testimony was admissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-5\">The fifth bill complains of the introduction of the testimony of State\u2019s witness J. B. Dunn. This witness makes a long statement as to the condition and relative position of the bed, gun, and gun rack, and the hole in the wall where prosecuting witness had alleged the gun fell and was accidentally discharged. However, the proof shows that the bed and other furniture were not in the same position they were at the time prosecuting witness Millie Jackson claims to have been accidentally shot. This would merely go to the weight of the testimony, and not to its admissibility. This bill also shows that witness was permitted to state that, in his opinion, Millie Jackson could not have been shot accidentally in the manner testified by her. This was the issue to be tried by the jury, and the opinion of the witness would not be testimony. He can state the relative position of the furniture, gun rack, location of the house, and other matters, and then leave the jury to draw conclusions legitimately from the testimony. The opinion of the witness should not have been admitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-6\">The' sixth bill complains of the introduction of Sims, who testified substantially as did Dunn, and also gave his opinion as to whether Millie Jackson could have been accidentally shot in the manner she claimed. The court states in his explanation to -the bill: \u201cDefendant did not ask to have the testimony stricken out, and did not request a charge upon same.\u201d This would not deprive appellant of the right to complain by bill and on motion for new trial of the admissibility of the illegal testimony. It was clearly inadmissible for the witness to give his opinion as indicated.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-7\">The judgment is reversed and the cause remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-8\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
