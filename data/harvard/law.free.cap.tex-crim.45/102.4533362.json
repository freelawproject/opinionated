I. Raleigh, and his punishment assessed at a fine of $5.</p>\n<p id=\"A8s\">The Assistant Attorney-General moves to dismiss the appeal, because the recognizance \u201cfails to substantially comply with the form prescribed in article 887, Court of Criminal Procedure. First, it fails to show the recognizance was taken in open court; second, the principal and sureties do not \u2018acknowledge themselves severally indebted to the State of Texas in the penal sum\u2019 fixed by the court. It is more onerous than the law requires in this, it obligates the principal, Willie Haley, to be indebted in the full sum of two hundred dollars; and the sureties in additional sums of two hundred dollars each.\u201d The recognizance states that, it was taken \u201cbefore the court in session,\u201d while the form prescribed by article 887 says, \u201cin open court.\u201d We do not think this is a valid objection to the recognizance. Nor do we think that the mere fact that the recognizance states the principal is bound for $200, and that each surety is bound in the sum of $200, is violative of the clause of article 887 which says that each are severally bound. In -other words, we think this recognizance is a substantial compliance with article 887. However, this court has repeatedly insisted that this recognizance, so simple in its form, should be complied with as written; but we can not say that this recognizance is not a substantial compliance with the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-19\">Appellant\u2019s motion for new trial insists that the evidence is insufficient to support the verdict. We do not think this is true. There is enough. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>evidence to support the verdict. However, the evidente for appellant strongly preponderates, both as to the extent of the injury to the cow and in refutation of the State\u2019s witness testimony that the cow was injured at all. But the State\u2019s witnesses testify to an injury to the cow. The facts show, with reasonable certainty, that appellant roped the cow, and that he inflicted upon her a cruel and wanton injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-5\">Appellant insists that the court should have granted him a new trial, on the ground of \"undiscovered evidence.\u201d It may be conceded that it was undiscovered at the time of the trial; but it does not come within any rules of newly discovered evidence, since the most casual diligence would have discovered this testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-6\">Ho error appearing in the record, the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
