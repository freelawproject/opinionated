On appeal Preacher argues: (1) that the district court erred in determining that abandonment is not a valid defense under \u00a7 1958 and erred in denying his proposed jury instruction on abandonment; and (2) because there was sufficient evidence of abandonment presented at trial, the district court also erred in denying Preacher\u2019s motion for judgment of acquittal. For the reasons that follow, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1228-17\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b1228-18\">Ronald Preacher was angry at his close friend, Ralph Burton, for \u201cstealing\u201d his girlfriend. Preacher threatened to kill Burton through a series of voicemails, and offered money to another friend and coworker, David Moore, to do the job for him. Moore refused the solicitation, so Preacher asked that he find someone to kill Burton instead.</p>\n<p id=\"b1228-19\">Moore informed Special Agent Zachary Coates about Preacher\u2019s solicitation. Under the FBI\u2019s direction, Moore made a recorded call to Preacher and told Preacher that he had found someone to do the job. Special Agent Ricky Gibbs was directed to act as Moore\u2019s hitman, going by the name of Rico. For several days, the two exchanged a series of text messages and phone calls regarding the hit. Preacher expressed fear of getting caught, but a desire to follow through with the plan nonetheless.</p>\n<p id=\"b1228-20\">On July 29, Preacher told Moore that he had gotten the money together to pay the hitman. Preacher stated that he had gone to his ex-girlfriend\u2019s house the night before and tampered with her car. That afternoon, Preacher left work and returned with $1,250.00 in cash (the half payment expected up front) and photos of Burton. Gibbs went to Preacher\u2019s workplace to meet and take payment. Preacher then told Gibbs he was afraid to go through with plan. He therefore cancelled <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1203\">*1203</page-number>the deal. After Gibbs left, Preacher was arrested.</p>\n<p id=\"b1229-5\">A federal grand jury indicted Preacher for using a facility of interstate commerce with the intent that a murder-for-hire be committed in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1958(a). Preacher proposed a jury instruction on the defense of abandonment, claiming that he abandoned his effort to commit the crime and that abandonment is a complete defense to \u00a7 1958. The government filed a motion in limine to preclude the use of an abandonment defense and requested that a special jury instruction be given explaining when a \u00a7 1958 offense is complete. The district court made a finding that a \u00a7 1958 offense is complete once a defendant uses a facility of interstate commerce with the requisite intent. The district court then granted the government\u2019s motion in limine and denied Preacher\u2019s proposed jury instruction, finding that a completed crime cannot be abandoned. After trial the jury returned a guilty verdict, and Preacher was sentenced to 36-months imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1229-6\">II. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b1229-7\">A district court\u2019s denial of a proposed jury instruction is reviewed for an abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Westry, </em>524 F.3d 1198, 1216-17 (11th Cir.2008). However, we review a district court\u2019s determination of the availability of a defense under a statute <em>de novo. United States v. Thompson, </em>25 F.3d 1558, 1563 (11th Cir.1994). Therefore we apply a <em>de novo </em>review to the district court\u2019s determination that abandonment is not a defense to \u00a7 1958 and refusal to give a jury instruction in that regard.</p>\n<p id=\"b1229-8\">Section 1958(a) prohibits:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A44\">traveling] in or causing] another (including the intended victim) to travel in interstate or foreign commerce, or us[ing] or causing] another (including the intended victim) to use the mail or any facility of interstate or foreign commerce, with intent that a murder be committed in violation of the laws of any State or the United States as consideration for the receipt of, or as consideration for a promise or agreement to pay, anything of pecuniary value.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1229-12\">18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1958(a). In order to get a conviction under this statute, the government must prove that the defendant: (1) used or caused another to use any facility of interstate or foreign commerce; (2) with the intent that a murder be committed; (3) as consideration for a promise or agreement to pay anything of pecuniary value. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1958(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b1229-13\">We have yet to address the issue of whether abandonment is a defense to a charge under this statute, but we find instructive the Eighth Circuit\u2019s discussion of when a \u00a7 1958 offense is complete. In <em>United States v. Delpit, </em>94 F.3d 1134, 1149-50 (8th Cir.1996), the Eighth Circuit stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1229-14\">This statute is relatively straightforward, both in what it prohibits and in what it does not reach. It does not prohibit murder or attempted murder. Instead, it outlaws using interstate-commerce facilities with the intent that murder-for-hire be committed. Once the interstate-commerce facility is used with the required intent the crime is complete. One who travels or causes another to travel in interstate commerce with the necessary murderous intent need not do anything else to violate the statute.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1229-15\"><em>Id. We </em>agree with the Eighth Circuit that once the defendant uses an instrument of interstate commerce with the intent that a murder-for-hire be committed, the crime is completed.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1230-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1204\">*1204</page-number>Moreover, we conclude that once a crime is completed, it logically can no longer be abandoned. Preacher used and caused Agent Gibbs to use an instrument of interstate commerce, a cellular telephone, with the intent that an individual be murdered for a price to be paid by Preacher. The first time that Preacher used his cell phone to communicate his desire that the victim be killed for money, he violated \u00a7 1958. Abandonment only remains a defense to a completed crime if Congress provides for such a defense in the statute. <em>See, e.g., </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 373.</p>\n<p id=\"b1230-4\">Because we hold that abandonment is not an affirmative defense to a completed violation of \u00a7 1958, the district court appropriately declined to give Preacher\u2019s proposed jury instruction and properly denied his motion for a judgment of acquittal. Accordingly, Preacher\u2019s conviction is</p>\n<p id=\"b1230-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1229-9\">. Preacher attempts to distinguish himself from the defendant in <em>Delpit </em>by arguing that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1204\">*1204</page-number>the indictment against him charges an ongoing crime, and therefore the crime cannot said to be complete at the first instance he used his cell phone with the requisite intent. We need not address this issue, however, because the indictment clearly charges a single crime occurring \"on or about\u201d certain dates and not an ongoing crime.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
