M. ARMSTRONG, Appellant, <em>v. </em>D. LOWE, Respondent.</parties>\n<syllabus data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"syllabus\" id=\"b648-6\">Authority of Beat, Estate Brokers Employed \u201cto Sell\u201d Land.\u2014 Where real estate brokers are employed \u201cto sell \u201d land, they have not, from this alone, authority to execute a contract to convey.</syllabus>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b648-7\">Arpead from a judgment of the Superior Court of San Luis Obispo County, and from an order refusing a new trial.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b648-8\">In January, 1887, the defendant employed the firm of Cook &amp; Henderson, real estate brokers, to sell certain land belonging to him, and executed and delivered to them the following written memorandum:\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b648-9\">\u201cSan Luis Obispo, January 6,1887. \u201cW.

I hereby agree to pay you the sum of five per cent for your services in case you effect a sale, or find a purchaser for the same, or will pay you two and a half per cent of above commission should I sell the same myself, or through another agent. This authority to remain in full force for the term of three months, or until canceled by (Signed) \u201cD. Lowe.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b648-12\">Subsequently Cook &amp; Henderson entered into a written contract with the plaintiff to sell him the property, which consisted of ten acres, in consideration of two thousand dollars, to be paid upon the delivery of a satisfactory deed by the defendant. Upon the refusal of the defendant to execute the deed, the plaintiff brought the present action to recover damages for the breach of the contract to sell. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>Judgment was rendered in favor of the defendant, from which, and from an order refusing a new trial, the plaintiff appealed.

Wilcoxon, </em>for Appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b649-5\">The written authorization to Cook <em>&amp; </em>Henderson shows that it was the intention of the parties that they should be more than mere brokers to find a purchaser. The authority given them included the power to enter into a valid contract of sale. <em>(Rutenberg </em>v. <em>Main, </em>47 Cal. 219; Code Civ. Proc., sec. 2175; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Babbitt, </em>1 Black, 55; <em>Biggerstaff </em>v. <em>Briggs, </em>3 West Coast Rep. 354; <em>Hopwood </em>v. <em>Corbin, </em>63 Iowa, 218; <em>McNeil </em>v. <em>Shirley, </em>33 Cal. 202.)</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b649-6\"><em>Venable &amp; Coodchild, </em>and <em>W.

Rep. 617; <em>Rutenberg </em>v. <em>Main, </em>47 Cal. 219; <em>Fish </em>v. <em>Henarie, </em>13 Or. 156; <em>Barnard </em>v. <em>Mounot, </em>34 Barb. 90; <em>Coleman </em>v. <em>Garrigan, </em>18 Barb. 67; <em>Glenworth </em>v. <em>Luther, </em>21 Barb. 145; <em>Holly </em>v. <em>Gosling, </em>3 E.

We think that upon the authority of <em>Duffy </em>v. <em>Hobson, </em>40 Cal. 244, 245, 6 Am. Rep. 617, it must be held that they had not, and that the case of <em>Rutenberg </em>v. <em>Main, </em>47 Cal. 219, is not in point.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-9\">We therefore advise that the judgment and order denying a new trial be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>Foote, C., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-5\">Belcher, C.
