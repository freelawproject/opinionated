BURHAM, Appellant, v. SAN FRANCISCO FUSE MANUFACTURING COMPANY, Respondent.</parties>\n<syllabus data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b56-4\">Corporation\u2014Dissolution at Instance op Stockholder.\u2014The facts that the officers of a corporation had refused to allow a stockholder to inspect its account-hooks, that it is carrying on a losing business, and that the directors had levied an assessment for the purpose of compelling the stockholder to dispose of his stock, are insufficient to entitle the stockholder to maintain an action for the dissolution of the corporation.</syllabus>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b56-5\">Appeal from a judgment of the Superior Court of the city and county of San Francisco, and from an order setting aside a restraining order.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b56-6\">The action was brought by the plaintiff, a stockholder in the corporation defendant, to restrain the sale of his stock for a delinquent assessment, and for the appointment of a receiver to take charge of and wind up the affairs of the defendant. The court granted a preliminary restraining order, which was afterwards set aside, and judgment rendered in favor of the defendant. The further facts are stated in the opinion of the court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b56-7\"><em>J.

If in this state a corporation may be dissolved at the suit of a stockholder, the court below was justified in refusing such decree upon the facts alleged in the present com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>plaint. (Civ. Code, sec. 377; Taylor on Private Corporations, 610, 611.)</p>\n<p id=\"b58-4\">The demurrer was properly sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-5\">Judgment-and order affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-6\">Searls, C.
