The defendant, in paragraph 3 of his answer, alleged that the work and materials were done and furnished in pursuance of a written agreement executed by the defendant and the plaintiff, a copy of which was annexed to the answer and pleaded as an exhibit, and that before the work therein mentioned was commenced, \u201cthe agreement was filed in the.office of the county recorder of San Diego County, state of California, in the county where the said property is situated.\u201d The answer further alleged a breach of the agreement by the plaintiff, in that he had failed to finish certain of the work within the time required by its terms, and prayed for damages sustained by reason of the delay. By the terms of the agreement set up in the answer, it was provided that the plaintiff should do the work \u201cconformable to the drawings and specifications made by C. E. Sawyer, and signed by the parties, within the time aforesaid, .... and also shall and will find and provide suc-h good, proper, and sufficient materials of all kinds whatsoever as shall be proper and sufficient for completing and finishing all the said brick-laying and plastering and other works of said buildings mentioned in the brick<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>layer\u2019s specifications.\u201d The plaintiff demurred to this portion of the answer, claiming that the plans and specifications were part of the contract, and should have been filed in the office of the county recorder, and not having been so filed, that the contract was void, so that neither party could recover thereon. In support of this position the plaintiff relied on section 1183 of the Code of Civil Procedure, which at the time the contract was executed provided as follows: \u201cSection 1183. All such contracts shall be in writing when the amount agreed to be paid thereunder exceeds one thousand dollars, and shall be subscribed by the parties thereto, and shall, before the work is commenced, be filed in the office of the county recorder of the county, or city and county, where the property is situated, who shall receive one dollar for such filing; otherwise, they shall be wholly void, and no recovery shall be had thereon by either party thereto; and in such case the labor done and materials furnished by all persons aforesaid, except the contractor, shall be deemed to have been done and furnished at the personal instance of the owner, and they shall have a lien for the value thereof.\u201d The demurrer was sustained, and judgment rendered in favor of the plaintiff. The further facts are stated in the opinion of the court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b467-5\"><em>M. A.
