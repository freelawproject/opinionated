We conclude it cannot.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-30\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b776-31\">Appellants Automaker, Inc. and U.S. Modular, Inc. sued appellees USA Factors and Financial Services Company, C.C.R.T. Company, Ltd., 1911 Financial Services, Inc., Howard B. Chapman, Glen C. Runnels, Richard B. Tribe, and Richard B. Cole in Fort Bend County over a financial agreement between the parties. The parties eventually settled this initial lawsuit. Automaker, U.S. Modular, and appellant Daniel H. Stinger later filed a third-party action against USA <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"745\">*745</page-number>Factors, C.C.R.T., 1911 Financial, Chapman, Runnels, Tribe, and Cole in Harris County. The third-party action initially included claims for usury, breach of the duty of good faith and fair dealing, negligence, and gross negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-4\">USA Factors, C.C.R.T., 1911 Financial, Chapman, Runnels, Tribe, and Cole filed a motion for summary judgment based on res judicata, release, estoppel, and lack of individual liability of Chapman, Runnels, Tribe, and Cole. On October 14,1994, the trial court heard the motion, and it rendered and signed a general summary judgment on November 11, 1994.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The day before the trial court rendered summary judgment, Automaker, U.S. Modular, and Stinger filed an amended third-party action, adding a claim for breach of the settlement and compromise agreement that ended the Fort Bend County lawsuit. Although Automaker, U.S. Modular, and Stinger did not file a motion requesting leave of court to file their amended pleading, the trial court on February 21, 1995 signed an \u201cOrder Granting Leave to File Late Response to C.C.R.T.\u2019s Motion for Summary Judgment.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The trial court signed the order on the last day the court possessed plenary power. See Tex.R. Civ. P. 329b(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b777-5\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b777-6\">In points of error one and two, Automaker, U.S. Modular, and Stinger contend the trial court erred in rendering a summary judgment because their amended pleadings raised additional causes of action not addressed by the motion for summary judgment. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-13\">It is well-settled summary judgment law that if a nonmovant for summary judgment (1) files an amended pleading <em>after </em>the summary judgment hearing and (2) the amended pleading raises an additional claim not mentioned in the summary judgment motion, then the trial court does not err in granting the summary judgment <em>motion </em>because \u201cthe pleadings ... on file <em>at the time of the hearing, </em>or filed thereafter and before judgment with permission of the court, show ... there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Tex.R. Civ. P. 166a(e) (emphasis added); <em>see </em>Tex.R. Civ. P. 63; <em>Hussong v. Schwan\u2019s Sales Enters., Inc., </em>896 S.W.2d 320, 323 (Tex.App. \u2014 Houston [1st Dist.] 1995, no writ); <em>West Tex. Gas, Inc. v. 297 Gas Co., </em>864 S.W.2d 681, 685 (Tex.App. \u2014 Amarillo 1993, no writ); <em>Leinen v. Buffington\u2019s Bayou City Serv. Co., </em>824 S.W.2d 682, 685 (Tex.App. \u2014 Houston [14th Dist.] 1992, no writ). A nonmovant must secure the court\u2019s permission if it files the amended pleading <em>after </em>the summary judgment hearing. <em>Leinen, </em>824 S.W.2d at 685; <em>cf. Goswami v. Metropolitan Sav. &amp; Loan Ass\u2019n, </em>751 S.W.2d 487, 490 (Tex.1988) (if amended pleading filed <em>before </em>summary judgment hearing and within seven days of hearing, trial court presumed to have given permission to file).</p>\n<p id=\"b777-14\">In this appeal, even if we were to interpret the trial court\u2019s February 21, 1995 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"746\">*746</page-number>order as granting leave to file an amended pleading, the order would be ineffective because rule 166a provides that the amended pleadings must be filed <em>before </em>judgment <em>with </em>permission of the court. <em>See Hussong, </em>896 S.W.2d at 323. Here the trial court did not grant permission to file the amended pleadings until <em>after </em>it rendered judgment. A trial court cannot grant a motion to amend the pleadings once the trial court renders judgment. <em>Texas Gen. Indent. Co. v. Ellis, </em>888 S.W.2d 830, 831-32 (Tex.App.\u2014Tyler 1994, no writ); <em>Boarder to Boarder Trucking, Inc. v. Mondi, Inc., </em>831 S.W.2d 495, 498-99 (Tex.App.\u2014Coipus Christi 1992, no writ); <em>Briercroft Serv. Corp. v. Perez, </em>820 S.W.2d 813, 818 (Tex.App.\u2014Corpus Christi 1990), <em>aff'd in part, rev\u2019d in part on other grounds, </em>809 S.W.2d 216 (Tex.1991); <em>Morris v. Har-grove, </em>351 S.W.2d 666, 668 (Tex.Civ.App.\u2014Austin 1961, writ ref d n.r.e.); <em>see Merckling v. Curtis, </em>911 S.W.2d 759, 771 (Tex.App.\u2014Houston [1st Dist.] 1995, writ denied) (\u201cA party, upon leave of court, may amend its pleadings to include issues tried by consent at any time up to the submission of the ease to the court or jury-\u201d) (citing Tex.R. Civ. P. 67).</p>\n<p id=\"b778-6\">The rendition of judgment is obviously a significant event in the life of a lawsuit. If an adversely affected party seeks to set aside or modify that judgment, it should do so openly by filing a motion for new trial or a request to modify, correct, or reform the judgment. Public policy concerns favoring the finality of judgments counsel against allowing a party to set aside a judgment covertly, <em>e.g., </em>by a postjudgment motion requesting permission to file amended pleadings. Accordingly, we conclude the trial court did not err in rendering summary judgment when the nonmovants did not timely file amended pleadings and did not obtain the trial court\u2019s prejudgment permission to file the untimely amended pleadings.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-7\">We overrule points of error one and two. The discussion of the remaining points of error does not meet the criteria for publication set forth in Texas Rule of Appellate Procedure 47.4. Accordingly, the remainder of the opinion is not designated for publication.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-9\"><em>We </em>affirm the judgments of the trial courts.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b777-7\">. The summary judgment order reads in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AE1e\">On October 14, 1994, came on for hearing [USA Factors, C.C.R.T., 1911 Financial, Chapman, Runnels, Tribe, and Cole\u2019s] Motion for Summary Judgment, and the Court, having considered the pleadings, evidence, and arguments of counsel, is of the opinion that the motion is meritorious and should be GRANTED; it is therefore;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AhSX\">ORDERED that [USA Factors, C.C.R.T., 1911 Financial, Chapman, Runnels, Tribe, and Cole\u2019s] Motion for Summary Judgment is GRANTED in all respects....</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"A1ic\">.

After considering the pleadings, the motion, the response, affidavits, and other evidence on file, the Court GRANTS [Automaker and U.S. Modular\u2019s] motion.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b777-16\">It is ORDERED that Automaker\u2019s, (et al) <em>First Amended Cross-Action </em>and Supplemental Response <em>be filed </em>and deemed a timely response to C.C.R.T. Company's, (et al) Motion for Summary Judgment pursuant to Rule 166a of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b777-17\">(Emphasis added.) Nothing in this order indicates that on judgment day (November 11, 1994) the court was considering a motion requesting leave to file the first amended cross-action.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
