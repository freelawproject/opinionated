The complaint showed that of six trustees named in the will one had died, and a second had been removed as incompetent, by the supe<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>rior court, leaving but four others; that the will provided that when the number of the trustees was reduced to four, the four trustees should appoint another, and that they had appointed a fifth trustee, who was joined as a co-plaintiff. The last demurrer of the defendant alleged that the complaint did not state a cause of action, because it did not show that the fifth trustee had been appointed by the superior court or was qualified to act, or that the real property had been vested in him. A previous general demurrer to the complaint had been overruled, and the time to answer had been repeatedly extended. The last demurrer was filed at the expiration of the time allowed to answer, but was not served, and was stricken from the files, with an order that the defendants answer during the day on which the order was made. Having failed to answer during that day, their default was entered at nine o\u2019clock of the following morning, and an answer was filed thereafter on the same day that the default was entered. Further facts are stated in the opinion of the court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b524-5\"><em>Moses G.

Y. 502.) The superior court should have appointed another trustee on nomination of the remaining trustees. (Civ. Code, sec. 2237; <em>Brennan </em>v. <em>Willson, </em>71 N. Y. 502.) The answer filed after entry of default should not have been stricken out. <em>(Mayor </em>v. <em>James, </em>17 Hun, 588; <em>Ghirardelli </em>v. <em>McDermott, </em>22 Cal. 539; <em>Greenbaum </em>v. <em>Turrill, </em>57 Cal. 285; <em>Lybecker </em>v. <em>Murray, </em>58 Cal. 186.)</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b524-7\"><em>W.
