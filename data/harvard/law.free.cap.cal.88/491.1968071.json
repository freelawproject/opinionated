C. 519.) The provision of the Political Code for a penalty is the imposition of a penalty by law. The legislature may delegate power to fix a sum not exceeding a certain amount. <em>(McAllister </em>v. <em>Hamlin, </em>83 Cal. 361.)</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b520-7\"><em>S.

St. Rep. 257.) The rule attempts to make certain forbidden acts an offense, and the payment of five hundred dollars the penalty or forfeiture therefor. <em>(United States </em>v. <em>Montell, </em>Taney, 47; <em>Clark </em>v. <em>Barnard, </em>108 U.

In other words, it is a fixed penalty imposed by law as a <em>punishment </em>for breach of duty enjoined by law, and must be treated as such,\u201d etc.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b521-7\">The board of harbor commissioners is a creature of the statute, and purely an executive body, and the fixing and imposing of penalties are matters of which the legislature alone has cognizance. An act providing that if a person does or does not do a certain thing he shall pay a penalty of five hundred dollars is legislation. And it is a cardinal principle of representative government that the legislature cannot delegate the power to make laws to any other authority or body. (Cooley\u2019s Constitutional Limitations, 116, 139.)</p>\n<p id=\"b521-9\">Conceding that the legislature could delegate to the plaintiff the authority to make rules and regulations with reference to the navigation of Humboldt Bay, the penalty for the violation of such rules and regulations is a matter purely in the hands of the legislature.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-10\">The act of the legislature in fixing the maximum of such penalty is of no avail; the vice of the whole matter is in not itself fixing the penalty, and in delegating such legislative power to the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>Justice Agnew, in <em>Locke\u2019s Appeal, </em>72 Pa. St. 491, 13 Am. Rep. 716, says : \u201cThe legislature cannot delegate its power to make a law ; but it can make a law to delegate a powmr to determine some fact or state of things upon which the law makes or intends to make its own action depend. To deny this would be to stop the wheels of government.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b522-3\">And it would seem that the establishment of rules as to the navigation of Humboldt Bay would be simply acts of executive administration which the legislature could delegate to the plaintiff as an executive body under the foregoing authority; but when the executive body has made such rules and regulations, it has exhausted all the authority which the legislature had power to confer upon it.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-4\">In the case at bar, the legislature attempted to go further than in the case of <em>Ex parte Cox, </em>63 Cal. 21.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-5\">Under an act of the legislature approved March 4, 1881, the viticultural health officer, with the approval of the board of viticultural commissioners, was empowered to declare and enforce ruj.es in the nature of quarantine, to prohibit the importation of diseased vines, etc.; and further provided that any willful violation of these rules should constitute a misdemeanor.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-6\">The petitioner Cox was discharged upon <em>habeas corpus </em>by this court, he having been convicted of violating certain of these rules and regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-7\">The court said : \u201c For the purpose of local legislation, legislative functions may be conferred upon and exercised by municipal corporations; but the act before us is in no sense a conferring of powers for municipal purposes. The legislature had not authority to confer upon the officer or board the power of declaring what acts should constitute a misdemeanor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b522-8\">In that case, the legislature delegated the power to the board to make the rules, but expressly provided in the act itself the punishment for the violation of such rules. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>But in the case at bar, the legislature not only delegated the power to the plaintiff to make the rules and regulations, but went far beyond that, and attempted to delegate the power to the plaintiff to punish for the violation of such rules and regulations. This could not be done.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-5\">Let the judgment be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-6\">Harrison, J., and Paterson, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
