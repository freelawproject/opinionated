Connor v. Vicksburg &amp; M. R. Co., 36 Fed. Rep. 273; Rice v. Newport News &amp; M. V. R. Co., 3 W.

Consolidated Ice Mach. Co., 138 Ill. 67.</p><p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b148-9\" pgmap=\"148\">The defendant executed the note sued on, to plaintiff, and having thus dealt with it, he is therefore estopped to deny it is legally organized.
