Pierce, 75 Ill. 426, 435.</p><p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b226-7\" pgmap=\"226\">An agent, the principal being absent, having full charge, management and control of the business of the principal, must necessarily possess and exercise the same power and authority in the business that his principal could if present. A general agency, until revoked, is co-extensive in scope and duration with the business. The German Fire Ins. Co. v. Grunert, 112 Ill. 68.</p><p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b226-8\" pgmap=\"226\">Power to act generally in a particular business or a particular course of trade, will constitute a general agency, if this is so indicated, no matter what the private instructions of an agent may.be. The extent of the authority of an agent should not be confounded with the nature of the agency; but his action will bind his principal, in either case, within the general scope of the authority which the world has been permitted to suppose he possesses. The authority of an agent may be shown by his acts about the business of his principal, and the previous course of dealing by the agent is proper evidence. Doan et al. v. Duncan, 17 Ill. 272.</p><p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b226-9\" pgmap=\"226\">Power to act generally in a particular business or a particular course of trade in a business, however limited, would constitute a general agency, if the agent is so held out to the world, howsoever restricted his private instructions may be. Crain v. National Bank, 114 Ill. 516, 526.</p><p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b226-10\" pgmap=\"226\">An agent may make himself liable to his principal for an act done in excess of his authority, and yet the principal be responsible to third persons for the act, if done within the scope of the agent\u2019s apparent authority.

The defense was a set-off exceeding the demand sued upon.</p> <p id=\"b227-6\" pgmap=\"227\">For the purposes of this opinion it is assumed that J. E. Avery was the general western agent of the appellant, and resident of Chicago, where the appellee was in business.</p> <p id=\"b227-7\" pgmap=\"227\">Cigarettes were the goods principally dealt in between the parties.</p> <p id=\"b227-8\" pgmap=\"227\">The appellant was a manufacturer in Eochester, H. Y., and a fierce competition was raging between it and a monopoly named American Tobacco Company, for the trade of buyers.</p> <p id=\"b227-9\" pgmap=\"227\">The American Tobacco Company were offering a special rebate of thirty cents per thousand on cigarettes bought of it, to buyers who would buy of no one else. To induce the appellee to continue buying of the appellant, Avery gave to the appellee this writing:</p> <blockquote id=\"b227-10\" pgmap=\"227\">\u201c Chicago, May 28, 1890.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"AHG\" pgmap=\"227\">Messrs. W. H. Heegaard &amp; Co., City.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b227-11\" pgmap=\"227\">Gentlemen :\u25a0\u2014We, in consideration of your handling our cigarettes, guarantee that you will receive the rebate of 30 c. pr. M. on all cigarettes you handle manufactured by the Amer. Tob. Co., or its branches, from April 1st, 1890, until April 1st, 1891. Yours truly,</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b227-12\" pgmap=\"227\">J. E. Avery, Gen\u2019l. Agt.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b227-13\" pgmap=\"227\">S. F. Hess &amp; Co.,</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b227-14\" pgmap=\"227\">Eochester, H. Y.\u201d</blockquote> <p id=\"b227-15\" pgmap=\"227(20) 228(27)\">There is no evidence that the home office of the appellant, or any person therewith connected, had any knowledge of that writing until all dealings between the parties had. ceased; nor is there any evidence of any ratification of it, nor of any similar transaction with anybody.</p> <p id=\"b228-5\" pgmap=\"228\">The appellant did settle with another customer upon the terms of this writing:</p> <blockquote id=\"b228-6\" pgmap=\"228\">\u201cConfidential. May 27th.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b228-7\" pgmap=\"228\">Messrs. A. Meyer &amp; Co., 141 La Salle Street, Chicago:</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b228-8\" pgmap=\"228\">Gentlemen :\u2014In consideration of the friendship you have extended to us in the fight against the cigarette combine, we hereby authorize you, when you remit to S. F. Hess &amp; Co., to take off, in addition to the regular trade discount of ten per cent and two and one-half off for cash, a special discount also of two and one-half per cent, which arrangement please consider strictly private.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b228-9\" pgmap=\"228\">Tours, etc.,</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b228-10\" pgmap=\"228\">J. E. Aveby,</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b228-11\" pgmap=\"228\">Gen\u2019l Agt. S. F. Hess &amp; Co.\u201d</blockquote> <p id=\"b228-12\" pgmap=\"228\">The distinction between the two writings is obvious. The latter contains terms upon which goods sold by appellant might be paid for.</p> <p id=\"b228-13\" pgmap=\"228\">It concerned the business of the appellant only, and as a general agent may do for his principal such acts, within the general scope of the business intrusted to the agent, as the principal might do, the terms of sale of the goods were within the authority of the agent. But the first paper was a collateral undertaking to answer for the conduct of a competitor. The consideration or inducement which moves an agent to undertake or bind his principal, does not enlarge the authority to bind.</p> <p id=\"b228-14\" pgmap=\"228\">The principle has been often applied to partners. See Bates on Partnership, Sec. 320 et seq.</p> <p id=\"b228-15\" pgmap=\"228\">The set-off claimed by, and allowed to, the appellee, was for the rebates that he did not receive from the American Tobacco Company. It is unnecessary to go through the details of the case, as the real question is whether the appellant was bound to make good to the appellee, the rebates, if the American Tobacco Company would not allow them.</p> <p id=\"b228-16\" pgmap=\"228\">Holding that the appellant was not bound, the judgment is reversed and the cause remanded.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
