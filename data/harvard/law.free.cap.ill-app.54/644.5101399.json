E. Crandall, it is understood that said $1,000 is to be retained by said Payne until the matter of said lots and farm is closed, not exceeding said fifteen days.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b643-9\" pgmap=\"643\">Dated April 14, 1891.\u201d</blockquote> <p id=\"b643-10\" pgmap=\"643\">The plaintiff in error was no party to the trade, but the title to the lots was to come from him to one of the parties. He does not seem to have been in fault, and yet between the parties \u201cthe matter of said lots and farm\u201d was never \u201c closed.\u201d His argument now is \u201c that this was to be done Avithin fifteen days, but whether or not done within that time, plaintiff in error Avas not to suffer; the $1,000 Avas to be paid to him at the expiration of the fifteen days at all events.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b643-11\" pgmap=\"643\">There was no contract betAveen him and anybody as to this money, and conceding that he might sue for money had and received by a stranger Avho had received money to be paid to him, yet he could only sue after the event upon Avhich the payment depended had happened. That event could never happen so long as \u201c the matter \u201d was not \u201c closed,\u201d hoAvever stringent the arrangement betAveen the parties as to the time in Avhich it should happen.</p> <p id=\"b643-12\" pgmap=\"643\">The judgment is affirmed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
