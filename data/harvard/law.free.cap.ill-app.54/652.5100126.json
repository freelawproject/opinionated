But to put him in the position of guarantor, it is essential that Plesher should have been liable to the appellee. Brandt, Sur. &amp; Guar. 56, et seq.; Geary v. O\u2019Neil, 73 Ill. 593.</p> <p id=\"b651-6\" pgmap=\"651\">Plesher was unconscious when the appellee came to attend upon him, and although the services were for his benefit, and part of them rendered after he regained consciousness, yet there is not a syllable in the evidence indicating that anybody interested ever had a thought that he was liable. The finding of the court, without a jury, that the appellant was the party to whom alone credit was given, can not be disturbed.</p> <p id=\"b651-7\" pgmap=\"651\">The motion for a new trial assigned as the only ground that \u201c the judgment is contrary to the law and the evidence.\u201d Upon such a motion affidavits of new witnesses are not admissible, and therefore those filed are not considered, further than to say that even if newly disclosed evidence had been ground of the motion, the affidavits would have been unavailing. The judgment is affirmed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
