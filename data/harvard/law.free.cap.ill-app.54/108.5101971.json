The directors and visiting committee shall be guided by the circumstances of the member and the general term of our laws. Ho action shall be taken under this section until thirteen weeks\u2019 benefits have been paid.\u201d</p><p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b107-7\" pgmap=\"107\">The constitution is that of \u201c The Ancient Order of Hibernians of the United States of America.\u201d It was adopted at a national convention held at Cleveland, in 1884, as revised by a committee, while the by-laws were adopted as revised at a State convention held in Illinois the same year.</p><p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b107-8\" pgmap=\"107\">The defendant in error is a division of the general order above named.</p><p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b108-4\" pgmap=\"108\">The plaintiff in error was a member, as we gather from the evidence, before the revision of the by-laws, and has always kept his dues paid as thereby required. There is no claim made that his absence in Ireland forfeited or impaired any of the rights obtained by membership, nor that application for relief was not properly made.</p><attorneys data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b108-5\" pgmap=\"108\">Wm.

Hibernia Fire Engine Co. v. Harrison, 93 Pa. St. 264; Angell &amp; Ames on Corporations, Sec. 331.</p> <opinion data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\"> <author id=\"b108-8\" pgmap=\"108\">Mr. Presiding Justice Sample</author> <p id=\"ACW\" pgmap=\"108\">delivered the opinion of the Court.</p> <p id=\"b108-9\" pgmap=\"108\">The question in this case is narrowed down to the proposition as stated by the counsel of defendant in error. \u201c Was the defendant in error under its constitution and by-laws, compelled to continue the payment of sick benefits to the plaintiff in error indefinitely during the time plaintiff in error remained sick ? \u201d</p> <p id=\"b108-10\" pgmap=\"108(144) 109(106)\">It will be observed the constitutional provision is mandatory in its character as to the requirement of the payment of sick benefits. The weekly benefits shall be five dollars for each week for thirteen weeks during any twelve months, provided, however, that the board of directors and the committee on sick shall determine what further amount, if any, shall be appropriated. The term \u201c during any twelve months \u201d means the same as \u201c during any year.\u201d The phrase is one of limitation; what does it limit \\ Hot the period of sickness, the number of sicknesses, nor the number of \u201cthirteen weeks\u201d that benefits must be paid. That is, it would not be contended if the member was sick for thirteen weeks only during one year, and then again became and remained sick for another thirteen weeks the next year, that he could not receive sick benefits for each of such years. To so construe the constitution would be to hold that the benevolent feature of the order ivas exhausted by the payment of thirteen weeks\u2019 benefits, without regard to the length of time of membership. Such a construction would not accord with the preamble of the constitution, which declares, \u201c the membership of this order do declare that the intent and purpose of the order is to promote friendship, unity and true Christian charity among its members, by raising a stock or fund of money for maintaining the aged, sick, blind and infirm members.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b109-4\" pgmap=\"109\">It is clear that if a. member was sick at different times, during different \u201c twelve months \u201d or years, though such sickness should be prolonged more than \u201c thirteen weeks \u201d each of such years, that he would be entitled to the full amount of benefits each year. Therefore, the limitation is not as to the number of sicknesses. There is no more reason for holding the limitation applies to the length of time the member is sick. If the sickness is prolonged into different66 twelve months \u201d the member is entitled to the same benefits as if he had had two different sicknesses, one in each of such twelve months. The limitation was intended to measure the amount of benefits which the member had a right to demand during a certain period of time, viz., twelve months; that is, during no year shall the member be entitled to receive more than thirteen weeks\u2019 benefit at the rate of $5 for each week, though he may be sick during the entire year. This construction is believed to be in accord not only with the letter of the law, but also Avith the spirit of benevolence that pervades the constitution of this order. It is urged, however, the by-laavs indicate a different construction. The constitution and by-laws should be construed, if practicable, so that, like the constitution and statutes of the State, they Avill harmonize; that is, it aa\u00faII be presumed the framers of the by-laws intended the language used should be interpreted so that they will harmonize with the fundamental laAV of the order.</p> <p id=\"b109-5\" pgmap=\"109(19) 110(92)\">By the constitution the proper officers could extend benefits beyond the period of thirteen weeks during any one year, if they deemed it best so to do, or having determined to extend such benefits, which, being a matter of grace, they could at any time thereafter discontinue for such year. Sec. 5 of Art. 8 of the By-laws, read in the light of this interpretation, will harmonize with the constitutional provision relating to benefits. The authority thereby given to discontinue benefits relate to those benefits granted as a matter of grace, and not to those granted by virtue of the law. The judgment is reversed and the cause remanded.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
