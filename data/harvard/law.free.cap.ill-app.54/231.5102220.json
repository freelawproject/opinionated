Had such an agreement been embodied in the bill of exceptions, and thereby have borne the stamp of authenticity afforded by the signature of the trial judge, the requirements of the statute would have been fully met.</p> <p id=\"b230-8\" pgmap=\"230\">Or had there been a separate stipulation, evidencing such an agreement, as is usually done, it would be sufficient.</p> <p id=\"b230-9\" pgmap=\"230\">Where, as here, no such agreement is embodied in the bill of exceptions, \"we will, as in duty bound, look elsewhere in the transcript to find, if we can, the agreement, as evidenced by the stipulation referred to by the clerk.</p> <p id=\"b230-10\" pgmap=\"230\">So looking in this case, we do find a stipulation entitled in the suit of Houts v. Gage, in the Circuit Court, in words and figures as follows:</p> <blockquote id=\"b230-11\" pgmap=\"230\">\u201c It is hereby stipulated and agreed by and between the parties hereto and their respective attorneys that the original bill of exceptions may be incorporated in the record in said cause in lieu, of a copy thereof.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b230-12\" pgmap=\"230\">(Signed) Thomas W. Prtndiville,</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b230-13\" pgmap=\"230\">Plaintiff\u2019s Attorney.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"ATu\" pgmap=\"230\">Hewman &amp; Horthrup and</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"Ako\" pgmap=\"230\">S. O. Levinson,</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b230-14\" pgmap=\"230\">Defendant\u2019s Attorneys.\u201d</blockquote> <p id=\"b230-15\" pgmap=\"230\">But we find no other stipulation touching the bill of exceptions.</p> <p id=\"b230-16\" pgmap=\"230(9) 231(21)\">Ho one looking at that stipulation can find anything within it indicating that an appeal to this court, or any other, was in the contemplation of the parties to it.</p> <p id=\"b231-4\" pgmap=\"231\">It is a mere stipulation that the original bill of exceptions should be a part of the record of the cause as it stood in the Circuit Court, and nothing more.</p> <p id=\"b231-5\" pgmap=\"231\">We can not, without forcing upon one or the other of the parties to it, an interpretation which may not have been within his intention, give to that stipulation an effect not at all within its very plain wording.</p> <p id=\"b231-6\" pgmap=\"231\">This court has repeatedly held that such a stipulation is no compliance with the statute. Overman v. Consolidated Coal Company, 51 Ill. App 289, and cases there referred to.</p> <p id=\"b231-7\" pgmap=\"231\">We must, therefore, presume that the Circuit Court had before it ample evidence to sustain its judgment, tad, for the same reason, we must presume that the cause ivas properly placed and heard upon the short cause calendar.</p> <p id=\"b231-8\" pgmap=\"231\">The judgment of the Circuit Court is affirmed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
