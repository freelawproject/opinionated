Such preferences are not fraudulent' in fact or in law. An attachment can not be based upon the transfer, either intended or accomplished, by a debtor of his property to pay or secure honest debts, though such transfers cut off, and are intended to cut off, the redress of all others.

After the attachment was levied Young made an assignment for the benefit of creditors. The assignee interpleaded in this suit, claiming the goods attached. The appellant put in evidence what the appellee said in an examination before the County Court in the insolvency proceedings. As against himself his declarations, whether under oath or not, were admissible, but as against his assignee, his declarations, after the assignment, were not admissible.</p> <p id=\"b383-4\" pgmap=\"383\">Now if the attachment levied before the assignment were sustained by his declarations made after the assignment, what title would the assignee have % -The judgment is affirmed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
