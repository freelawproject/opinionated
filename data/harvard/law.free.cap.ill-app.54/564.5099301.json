It is agreed that said grantor shall pay all costs and attorney\u2019s fees incurred or paid by said grantee or the holder or holders of said note, in any suit in which either of them may be plaintiff or defendant, by reason of being a party to this trust deed, or a holder of said note, and that the same shall be a lien on said premises, and may be included in any decree ordering the sale of said premises and taken out of the proceeds of any sale thereof.\u201d</blockquote> <p id=\"b563-8\" pgmap=\"563\">John C. Behrer filed the bill making appellant, William Behrer, as trustee, and Julius Stern, successor in trust, parties defendant. Julius' Stern acted as complainant\u2019s solicitor. The court in its decree allowed the complainant a solicitor\u2019s fee of \u00a7100. This is said to have been error.</p> <p id=\"b563-9\" pgmap=\"563(33) 564(20)\">The compensation allowed is not to Mr. Stern, as trustee, nor is it for any services rendered by him, as trustee; indeed he seems never to have rendered any such service, but to have had at the most only a mere right of succession to what appears to have been a naked trust.</p> <p id=\"b564-6\" pgmap=\"564\">The case of Cheltenham Improvement Co. v. Whitehead, 128 Ill. 279, is decisive of this; see also Heffronv. Gage, M, E. Reporter, March 30, 1894, p. 569.</p> <p id=\"b564-7\" pgmap=\"564\">The making of Mr. Stern a party defendant, did not prevent his acting as solicitor for complainant, nor does it afford a reason why the complainant should not be allowed a solicitor\u2019s fee.</p> <p id=\"b564-8\" pgmap=\"564\">Mr. Stern had no duties to discharge or interests to defend; he was a mere nominal defendant.</p> <p id=\"b564-9\" pgmap=\"564\">The decree of the Superior Court is affirmed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
