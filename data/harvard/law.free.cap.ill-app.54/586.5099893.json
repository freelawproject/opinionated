Instructions\u2014'A Master as Insurer for Absolute Safety.\u2014In an action for personal injuries, the contest being over the construction of a pulley, it is proper to instruct the jury that the defendant is not bound as an insurer for the absolute safety and suitability of the machinery and appliances furnished by him for use in his business. He is not bound to furnish the very best or most approved kind of machinery to be used in his factory. It is sufficient if the machine and the pulleys and appliances connected with the same are reasonably safe and suitable for the purpose for which they were used.</headnotes><p data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b584-12\" pgmap=\"584\">Mr. Justice Shepard, dissenting.</p><summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b584-13\" pgmap=\"584\">Memorandum.\u2014Action for personal injuries.
