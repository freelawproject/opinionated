We find the maxim explained and applied (without reference now to railroad cases, such as I. C. R. R. v. Phillips, 49 Ill. 234) in the following, among other cases:</p><p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b478-12\" pgmap=\"478\">It applies \u201c even where no special relation like that of passenger and carrier exists between the parties,\u201d North C.

If the horses run around upon a road separating an inner inclosure from an outer one, and if within the inner inclosure are spectators, some on foot, and some in carriages, it is not apparent how the proprietors of the race course could hold the horses of the spectators. In the nature of things some, one in charge of any carriage would be also in charge of the horse or horses attached. Unless it be negligence to admit at all spectators in carriages, which, we suppose, would not be contended, there could be no neglect charged upon the appellee because a horse ran away.</p> <p id=\"b480-7\" pgmap=\"480\">The description in the declaration of a race course and what happens there, is not sufficient to show any duty of the appellee, and the averment of duty is idle. Angus v. Lee, 40. Ill. App. 304.</p> <p id=\"b480-8\" pgmap=\"480\">Uegligence by omission can only be where a duty is not performed. C. &amp; W. I. v. Roath, 35 Ill. App. 349.</p> <p id=\"b480-9\" pgmap=\"480\">The judgment is affirmed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
