Early in July, the appellants, on account of exigencies of their own business, and admittedly for no fault of the appellee, discharged her, and have paid her nothing since. She remained idle, wanting work. She has in this suit recovered the amount of her wages from the time of discharge to October 1, 1893.</p> <p id=\"b655-11\" pgmap=\"655(24) 656(38)\">There can be no defense to a suit like this except to deduct from the claim of the appellee what she earned or might have earned, elsewhere, during the period of idleness; and the burden of proof was on the appellants to show how much that was, or should have been. Fuller v. Little, 61 Ill. 21; Wood, Mas. &amp; Serv. 238.</p> <p id=\"b656-4\" pgmap=\"656\">She testified to unavailing efforts she made to obtain other employment, and her readiness to fulfill her engagement with the appellants is an almost necessary inference. If they wished to revoke the discharge, they should have notified her.</p> <p id=\"b656-5\" pgmap=\"656\">\u00a9n the merits there can be no reasonable complaint of the judgment.</p> <p id=\"b656-6\" pgmap=\"656\">The case was tried upon a \u201cshort cause calendar,\u201d against the objection and exception of the appellants. It appears that the plea was filed before the declaration was, but that does not prevent the two making an issue. No other plea was ever filed, and the case was tried upon the issue then made. No similiter is absolutely necessary. Hazen v. Pierson, 83 Ill. 241.</p> <p id=\"b656-7\" pgmap=\"656\">There is some confusion in the record as to identity of the affidavit upon which the cause was brought on for trial, but we can not find that there Avas any irregularity, and for such mere technicalities we do not make a very anxious search.</p> <p id=\"b656-8\" pgmap=\"656\">The real grievance on the part of the attorneys of the appellants, or at least that of which their complaint is most emphatic, is shoAvn by the folloAving extracts from the record:</p> <blockquote id=\"b656-9\" pgmap=\"656\">\u201c James D. Johnson, on his voir dire, testified in reply to questions put by defendant\u2019s counsel that he had difficulty Avith his employers touching payment of wages. Thereupon the counsel for defendants inquired of the said juror Avhether the trouble or difficulty in question would prejudice him against the defendants in the trial of this case, but the court ruled that the question was improper, and that the juror need not answer the question, to which ruling of the court the defendants by their counsel then and there duly excepted.\u201d</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b656-10\" pgmap=\"656(21) 657(21)\">\u201cEdward Ryan,- a juror, on his voir dire, testified: I am a fur dresser, employed at 198 Division street; working for Bromberg; don\u2019t know the plaintiff; never heard of this suit; never had any trouble with my employers, or dispute about wages.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b657-4\" pgmap=\"657\">Q. Let me ask you here: Suppose in this case that the court instructs you that the plaintiff\u2014</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b657-5\" pgmap=\"657\">The Court: I won't permit such questions\u2014as to what they would do on a certain state of proof.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b657-6\" pgmap=\"657\">(To which ruling of the court the defendants by their counsel then and there duly excepted.)</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b657-7\" pgmap=\"657\">Mr. Northrop: Now, let me ask you, if the evidence were equally balanced\u2014</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b657-8\" pgmap=\"657\">The Court: That you need not answer.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b657-9\" pgmap=\"657\">(To which ruling of the court the defendants by their counsel then and there duly excepted.)</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b657-10\" pgmap=\"657\">Mr. Northrop: Suppose, Mr. Kyan, that in this case the plaintiff could put in evidence\u2014</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b657-11\" pgmap=\"657\">The Court: I won\u2019t permit that kind of examination at all.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b657-12\" pgmap=\"657\">(To which ruling of the court the defendants by their counsel then and there duly excepted.)</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b657-13\" pgmap=\"657\">The Court: The only question that seems to me to be in this matter is, whether they can try this case fairly. Now, as to what he would do under the particular state of proof, I don\u2019t think it is a proper matter of examination.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b657-14\" pgmap=\"657\">Mr. Northrop: I don\u2019t see, your honor, how I can determine whether a juror has a prejudice or not unless I examine him on that behalf.\u201d</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b657-15\" pgmap=\"657\">X- 'X' -X\u00bb -X- -l\u00ed- \u2018X- X-</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b657-16\" pgmap=\"657\">a The Court: Any further questions of this witness ?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b657-17\" pgmap=\"657\">Mr. Northrop: I will see shortly.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b657-18\" pgmap=\"657\">The Court (immediately): Well, you may be excused.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b657-19\" pgmap=\"657\">Mr. Northrop: If the court please, I wish to note an exception to the court\u2019s ruling, and to state that I simply desire to confer with my associate counsel, Mr. Levinson, for a moment.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b657-20\" pgmap=\"657\">The Court (immediately): Is there any further question to be asked of the witness ? Otherwise, I will excuse her. Is there anything on the re-direct ?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b657-21\" pgmap=\"657\">Exception by defendants.\u201d</blockquote> <p id=\"b658-4\" pgmap=\"658\">There is too much of the same sort as to jurors to put in the whole; it occupies eleven printed pages of' the abstract.</p> <p id=\"b658-5\" pgmap=\"658\">That this preposterous method of examining jurors did at one time have the sanction of the Supreme Court, is no excuse for continuing it, since the decision in C. &amp; A. R. R. v. Fisher, 141 Ill. 614.</p> <p id=\"b658-6\" pgmap=\"658\">It is an extension of a vicious practice which grew up\u2014 how, probably nobody can tell\u2014in criminal cases, and described and reprobated by Gaston, Judge, one of the ablest wlio ever sat on the bench of any State, in State v. Benton, 2 Dev. &amp; Bat. Law, 196, at page 221.</p> <p id=\"b658-7\" pgmap=\"658\">A judge regardful of his duty, desires to dispatch business with some regard to the interests of the public; and under the ermine of the judge, is the cuticle of the man. Anglo-American P. &amp; P. Co. v. Baier, 31 Ill. App. 653.</p> <p id=\"b658-8\" pgmap=\"658\">Justice is done and the judgment is affirmed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
