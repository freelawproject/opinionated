Winans, 20 N. J. Eq. (5 C. E. Green) 392), is now seeking to have this court reverse its decision in this same case on a former appeal. Schroth v. Black, 50 Ill. App. 168.</p> <p id=\"b642-9\" pgmap=\"642\">That former decision is the law of the case for this court. C. M. &amp; St. Paul Ry. Co. v. Hoyt, 44 Ill. App. 48.</p> <p id=\"b642-10\" pgmap=\"642\">But by a praecipe for part only of the record, followed by the clerk in making up and certifying the transcript \u201c as per praecipe,\u201d the object of this appeal is not so apparent.</p> <p id=\"b642-11\" pgmap=\"642\">We have so often held that transcripts \u201c as per praecipe \u201d are insufficient, that we will not repeat the reasons. Wilkenson v. Linden Steel Co., 35 Ill. App. 448; Alling v. Wenzell, 46 Ill. App. 562. These cases having been many times followed since.</p> <p id=\"b642-12\" pgmap=\"642\">Hot having before us the complete case as the Circuit Court had it, we do not know whether any error was committed or not, and therefore affirm the decree.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
