That Benson left the college, and the college, without notice to or consent of the appellant, did appoint or elect one Buckmaster to the chair, neither he nor the college buying the ten shares held by the appellant, although he has demanded that it should be bought from him.</p> <p id=\"b662-9\" pgmap=\"662\">At the hearing the appellant desired by an amendment to insert some loose charges of \u201c in fraud of,\u201d etc.; also allegations that the appellant bought the stock relying upon the by-law, believing that when Benson vacated, his successor or the college, would be legally bound to take the stock of the appellant, and that if an injunction is not granted to him restraining Buckmaster from teaching from the chair and the college from appointing another thereto, the shares of the appellant will become greatly depreciated and worthless in the hands of any other than those persons connected with the college. How that consequence was to follow was not stated, but in the view we take of the case it is not material. The Circuit Court refused to permit the amendment.</p> <p id=\"b662-10\" pgmap=\"662(21) 663(33)\">\u25a0 The by-law as stated in the appellant\u2019s abstract is\u2014\u201cand the stock of any such teacher leaving the school or college shall be purchased and held for the use of his successor before the vacant chair shall be occupied by any teacher, provided the previous teacher is willing to sell his stock.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b663-4\" pgmap=\"663\">The letter of the by-law refers only to stock of the outgoing teacher, and the purchase of it is contingent upon his willingness to sell. Anybody holding stock for his use is not within the by-law. Upon this single ground without considering the many questions raised by counsel, the decree of the Circuit Court sustaining a demurrer to, and dismissing the bill, is affirmed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
