Peterson v. Chemical Bank, 32 N. Y. 21.</p><p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b490-8\" pgmap=\"490\">The recognition of such rights is, as stated by Story on Conflict of Laws, Sec. 420, 8th Ed., in commenting on the case of Abraham v. Plestoro, referred to in In re Waite, \u201c a surrender of the principle; for no one will contend that the assignees can sue either in law or in equity in our courts, unless they possess some title under the assignment.\u201d</p><p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b490-9\" pgmap=\"490\">\u201c Where there has been an actual transfer of possession, the transfer will be upheld everywhere.\u201d Burrill on Assignments, 6th Ed., Sec. 281.</p><p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b490-10\" pgmap=\"490\">Aside from the considerations already given, it is the policy of our laws to broaden, rather than to limit the doctrine of comity.

It is not a question of the foreign receiver\u2019s general right to sue, but of his title to the goods in controversy in this case. We state the following propositions :</p><p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b491-4\" pgmap=\"491\">I. A receiver has of right no extra-territorial powers of official action.</p><p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b491-5\" pgmap=\"491\">II. By comity he may exercise such extra-territorial powers, but only where the rights of domestic creditors will not be prejudiced or injured thereby.</p><p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b491-6\" pgmap=\"491\">These propositions-are so universally accepted as to need no discussion.

Although the record is .destitute of statement as to the character of the proceedings wherein the receiver was appointed, it is apparent that the appointment was by the. court and was involuntary as to the corporation.</p> <p id=\"b492-12\" pgmap=\"492\">The privilege of a foreign receiver to exercise extra-territorial powers, is derived wholly from the doctrine of comity.</p> <p id=\"b492-13\" pgmap=\"492(42) 493(21)\">The favor, or courtesy, known as comity, is usually accorded to foreign receivers, either to sue in our courts, or to hold and deal with property here located, over which they have been appointed, where the result of so doing would involve no violation of our domestic policy, and would not conflict with the rights of creditor citizens of our own State.</p> <p id=\"b493-4\" pgmap=\"493\">But it is not the policy of this, or any other State, so far as we are advised, to permit receivers of foreign corporations to come within its limits and remove from our jurisdiction the property here located of such corporations, and thereby require our citizens who have claims against them to go into foreign jurisdictions to assert their rights.</p> <p id=\"b493-5\" pgmap=\"493\">The State owes a duty to its citizens to protect them in the assertion of their claims against such insolvent bodies, by retaining within its own jurisdiction and control such of their property as may be here located until the just claims and rights of its own citizens have been satisfied.</p> <p id=\"b493-6\" pgmap=\"493\">The doctrine of comity has never been so extended as to deny that duty.</p> <p id=\"b493-7\" pgmap=\"493\">The case of Heyer v. Alexander, 108 Ill. 385, is in point.</p> <p id=\"b493-8\" pgmap=\"493\">The controlling question in that case was whether a voluntary deed of assignment, made in Missouri, and valid there, by a debtor citizen of that State, for the benefit of his creditors, was operative to pass the title to real estate in Illinois, as against creditors in this State, and it Avas held that it was not. And it Avas so held notAvitlistanding actual possession of the real estate had been taken, under.the assignment, before the rights of others had attached.</p> <p id=\"b493-9\" pgmap=\"493\">It Avas there said: \u201c The doctrine is, that such a conveyance is subject to the claims of resident creditors where the property is located. This we regard as the true rule. It is not just or fair that creditors in this State should be compelled to go to a foreign State to receive a fro rata share of the debtor\u2019s property, Avhen they perhaps extended credit alone upon the faith of the debtor\u2019s property in this State and to Avhich they looked for payment.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b493-10\" pgmap=\"493\">The same doctrine is approved in May v. First Nat. Bank, 122 Ill. 551; Woodward v. Brooks, 128 Ill. 222; Henderson v. Schaas, 35 Ill. App. 155; Webster v. Indah, 27 Ill. App. 294; Ford v. Holbrook (No. 4759, this court, filed May 24, 1893).</p> <p id=\"b493-11\" pgmap=\"493(12) 494(11)\">If we were to resort to other States Ave should find the same principle reiterated in numerous cases, but it is unnecessary.</p> <p id=\"b494-6\" pgmap=\"494\">The case of C., M. &amp; St. P. Ry. Co. v. Keokuk Northern Packet Company, 108 Ill. 317, is clearly distinguishable from this case, and\" from Heyer v. Alexander, s%vpra, upon the grounds stated in the opinion in the latter case, and we only refer to it because it is strenuously urged as being decisive^ here.</p> <p id=\"b494-7\" pgmap=\"494\">If, then, it be the law that a voluntary assignment by the foreign owner of property has no extra-territorial effect as against creditors resident within the State where the property is located, how much stronger, and with what increased effect, does the rule apply in cases, where, as here, the proceedings were in invitum ?</p> <p id=\"b494-8\" pgmap=\"494\">\u201c A decree of court appointing an assignee to administer the debtor\u2019s property for the benefit of his creditors, whatever its effect in the State where it is rendered, has no extras territorial effect on the debtor\u2019s real estate in another or foreign jurisdiction.\u201d Heyer v. Alexander, supra.</p> <p id=\"b494-9\" pgmap=\"494\">In principle the rule in cases where the property in controversy is personal property, does not differ from that applied to real estate, when, as here, the receiver claims under an order or decree of a foreign court and not under a voluntary deed by the owner. \"Woodward v. Brooks, supra.</p> <p id=\"b494-10\" pgmap=\"494\">The court below properly held that under the facts disclosed by the record, the doctrine of comity must yield to the superior rights of the resident creditors, and the judgment will therefore be affirmed.
