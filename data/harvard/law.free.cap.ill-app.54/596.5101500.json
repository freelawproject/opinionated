Packer v. Roberts, 40 Ill. App. 445.</p> <p id=\"b597-8\" pgmap=\"597\">Nevertheless, we will consider the objections made.</p> <p id=\"b597-9\" pgmap=\"597\">First, that the warrant is to \u201c any attorney of any court oE record,\u201d and that there is no such attorney as \" Walker &amp; Walker\u201d who signed the cognovit.</p> <p id=\"b597-10\" pgmap=\"597\">We maybe mistaken in our conjecture that \u00a3\u2018Walker &lt;fe Walker \u201d means two persons. No law would forbid parents named Walker naming a child \u00a3\u00a3 Walker &amp;.\u201d In Cromwell\u2019s time during the French Revolution stranger names were in use, and the Superior Court is presumed to know the members of the bar practicing there. Crane v. Nelson, 37 Ill. App. 597.</p> <p id=\"b597-11\" pgmap=\"597\">In any case the objection is of no merit. Zimmerman v. Wead, 18 Ill. 304.</p> <p id=\"b597-12\" pgmap=\"597(22) 598(40)\">The objection that Goit had no interest in the note is by the brief of the plaintiffs in error subdivided into seven,! heads, but is answered by the fact that the bank held the note under an indorsement in blank by Bredt. Filling up such an indorsement is mere form, and may be wholly omitted. Trainer v. Adams, 54 Ill. App 523.</p> <p id=\"b598-5\" pgmap=\"598\">The holder under such an indorsement may sue in the name of any person who consents. Law v. Parnell, 7 C. B. N. S., 282, 97 E. C. L. 281.</p> <p id=\"b598-6\" pgmap=\"598\">By the affidavits filed on behalf of Goit, and such affidavits were admissible (Truby v. Case, 41 Ill. App. 153), it is made to appear so clearly that there can be no reasonable doubt of it, that the bank was a bona fide holder of the note, for value, deriving its title by indorsement of the payee before maturity.</p> <p id=\"b598-7\" pgmap=\"598\">In such case the makers, however much they were wronged by the payee, can have no redress or relief at the expense of the assignee. Thayer v. Richard, 44 Ill. App. 195.</p> <p id=\"b598-8\" pgmap=\"598\">The judgment is affirmed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
