Street, in answer to that proposition, said he would like to negotiate with Shoemaker for the lumber shed, stable, fencing and some other .things that they had on the ground, which were not included in the arbitration agreement, and that while he (Street) was negotiating for these he might make an arrangement to purchase the planking. Galloway said he had no objections to his buying the planking by private trade; that \u201c he could either buy it or take it at the appraised value.\u201d Street said he would take the premises on the terms named. They then put their agreement into writing. The agreement as written contains the following clause : \u201c The party of the second part (Street, Chatfield &amp; Co.) shall be entitled to take the planking now on said ground, belonging to Walter Shoemaker &amp; Co., at the appraised value, as provided in the lease between James B. Galloway and Walter Shoemaker &amp; Co., or to purchase said planking direct from said Walter Shoemaker &amp; Co., and at the expiration of the lease hereby agreed to be made, the first party agrees to purchase the planking on said yard of Street, Chatfield &amp; Co., at its then appraised value, to be appraised as follows: \u201c Each of the parties to said lease shall select one appraiser, and if these two can not agree, they shall select a third appraiser, and a majority of the three so chosen shall decide the value of said planking.\u201d</p><p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"At\" pgmap=\"569\">After this agreement was made, Street negotiated with Shoemaker &amp; Co., and bought the lumber shed, fencing and other property on the premises, but they could not agree on the price for the planking. Street then requested an immediate appraisal. Appraisers were appointed, but the one selected by Galloway declined to act, and Street then said he would himself get a man who would be acceptable and would make a good appraiser. Street informed Galloway of the time set for the appraisal and requested him to be present. On April 7, 1892, Street introduced Galloway to Holtmeier, the appraiser selected by Street, and an appraisal was made the same day. The price placed on the planking was almost $500 more than the amount for which it had been offered to Street by Shoemaker &amp; Co. Galloway left while the appraisers were at work, but Street remained until an appraisal was made.</p><p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b570-4\" pgmap=\"570\">The next day Street called on Galloway, and said the appraisal was too high, but he was willing to pay the amount for which it had been offered to him. Shoemaker &amp; Co. refused the offer.</p><p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b570-5\" pgmap=\"570\">Leases were drawn and tendered to Street, Chatfield &amp; Co., in accordance with the agreement referred to, a provision being inserted that Street, Chatfield &amp; Co. should pay the appraisal. They declined to sign the leases.</p><p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b570-6\" pgmap=\"570\">On May 1, 1892, Street, Chatfield &amp; Co. took possession of the property and the planking and are using the same in their business. On May 2, 1892, they sent the complainant notice to remove the planking. The original bill of complaint was filed on May 18, 1892.</p><p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b570-7\" pgmap=\"570\">A second amended bill was filed, praying for a reformation of the contract and for specific performance.</p><p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b570-8\" pgmap=\"570\">Defendants answered, admitting all the material allegations of the bill, denying, however, that Street, Chatfield &amp; Co. were bound to take the planking, and further that no mistake was made in the reduction of the agreement to writing.</p><p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b570-9\" pgmap=\"570\">A reference to a master in chancery was had, and testimony was taken. On the close of complainant\u2019s evidence, the master recommended the dismissal of the second amended bill for want of equity.

Millard, Attorney.</attorneys><p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b571-7\" pgmap=\"571\">The rule is well settled that a simple mistake of a party as to the legal effect of an agreement which he executed, or as ti the legal result of an act which he performs, is no ground for either defensive or affirmative relief. If there were no elements of fraud, concealment, misrepresentation, undue influence, violation of confidence reposed, or other inequitable conduct in the transaction, the party who knew or had an opportunity to know the contents of an agreement or other instrument, can not defeat its performance or obtain its cancellation or reformation, because he mistook the legal meaning and effect of the whole or any of its provisions.</p><p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b571-8\" pgmap=\"571\">Where the parties with knowledge of the facts, and without any inequitable incidents, have made an agreement or other instrument as they intended it should be, - and the writing expresses the transaction as it was understood and designed to be made, then the above rule uniformly applies; equity will not allow a defense or grant a reformation or rescission, although one of the parties\u2014and as many cases hold, both of them\u2014may have mistaken or misconceived its legal meaning, scope and effect. Pomeroy\u2019s Eq., Secs. 842, 843; also Note 1.</p><p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b572-4\" pgmap=\"572\">To this general rule exceptions exist, as, for instance, after making an agreement, if in the process of reducing it tO' writing a mistake is made by the scrivener, Avho fails to express Avhat the parties agreed upon, or where the mistake is common to both parties, such as where they act under some misapprehension of the legal effect of the transaction, or where there is a misconduct on the part of one of the parties, or some other reason whereby an inequitable situation is created, arising from misunderstanding the facts or the intentions of the parties, equity has in many cases granted relief; but this exception is only alloived to interfere with the general rule where it clearly appears from the evidence in the case that some state of facts existed which misled the parties; but where the parties, knoAving all the facts and familiar with the situation of all the circumstances, deliberately enter into an agreement, especially where the party complaining was learned in the law, as Avell as familiar Avith the facts, courts do not apply any exceptions to the general rule.

The intent of the parties is the thing at which courts endeavor to arrive in construing contracts. For this purpose the court will place itself in the shoes of the parties, that, viewing the subject-matter from their standpoint, it may read the contract in the light under which it was written. 2 Kent, 555; Boskowitz v.

The City, 46 Mo. 121; Seavers v. Cleary, 75 Ill. 349; Wilson v. Marlow, 66 Ill. 385.</p> <p id=\"b573-8\" pgmap=\"573\">Illumining the agreement by these well known rules of construction, and it is manifest that the defendants understood that they had agreed to do one of two things, viz., to take the planking then on the ground, belonging to Walter Shoemaker &amp; Co. at the appraised value as provided in the lease between Galloway and Shoemaker &amp; Co., or to purchase said planking direct from said Shoemaker &amp; Co. Defendants not being able to agree with Shoemaker &amp; Co. as to the price to be paid for the planking, requested an appraisal of the same. In accordance with such request an appraisement was had, one of the appraisers being selected by defendants.</p> <p id=\"b573-9\" pgmap=\"573(19) 574(55)\">The defendant attended throughout the appraisal, but when it was declared and was found to be $500 more than the price for which Shoemaker &amp; Co. had offered to sell the planking, defendants then declined to pay the sum so fixed, but offered to give the price at which, before the appraisal, Shoemaker &amp; Co. had offered to sell. Shoemaker &amp; Co., very naturally, refused to take less than the amount of the appraisal.</p> <p id=\"b574-5\" pgmap=\"574\">Defendants, by requesting an appraisal, selecting an appraiser and attending when the appraisal was being made, clearly indicated their understanding that having failed to agree with Shoemaker &amp; Co., they, defendants, were to take the planking at the price that should be fixed by appraisal.</p> <p id=\"b574-6\" pgmap=\"574\">Their conduct in this regard was meaningless, not to say absurd, if the result of such appraisal was to them a matter of no consequence, a thing by which they were in no xvise bound. There can be no doubt that if the appraisers had found the value of the planking to be $500 less than the sum for which Shoemaker &amp; Co. had offered to sell, defendants xvould have insisted upon their rights to take the same at the appraisal.</p> <p id=\"b574-7\" pgmap=\"574\">Defendants well knew how plaintiff understood the agreement; they had heard Galloway state the terms upon which he would make a lease, and while they may not directly haxe stated that they assented thereto, they had expressed no dissent, and proceeded to sign an agreement drawn up by Galloway after making such statement, in which Galloway told them that he would lease the property to defendants for $5,400 a year, providing defendants xvould take the property as provided in the lease to Shoemaker &amp; Co. The agreement thereafter signed provided for a lease at $5,400 a year, and contained the stipulation as to the planking hereinbefore mentioned.</p> <p id=\"b574-8\" pgmap=\"574\">Where the terms of an agreement are open to construction, a party may be held bound to the understanding which he knew his adversary had of the contract. Wells v. Carpenter, 65 Ill. 447; 2 Kent\u2019s Com., 557.</p> <p id=\"b574-9\" pgmap=\"574(28) 575(94)\">If the terms of the writing signed by the parties were unmistakable, the foregoing rule of construction would not be applicable; but the agreement viexved from the standpoint of the parties is not, as is contended by defendants, .clearly to the effect that they were under no obligation to take the planking upon any terms. It is not denied that the agreement shows that when it was made plaintiff was bound to purchase the planking, then on the premises, at a value to be fixed by appraisement; that defendants, the lessees, were to pay taxes upon the improvements; that plaintiff at the expiration of defendants\u2019 lease should purchase from them the planking on the premises at its then appraised value.</p> <p id=\"b575-5\" pgmap=\"575\">Looking at the written agreement alone, it may be said to be uncertain whether defendants were bound to take the planking under one of two ways for fixing its price, or might decline to take it at all. Regarding the contract from the standpoint of the parties and their subsequent conduct, we have no doubt as to its meaning.</p> <p id=\"b575-6\" pgmap=\"575\">By the agreement of the parties, the defendants became bound when the appraisal had been had to discharge the obligation of plaintiff, Shoemaker &amp; Co., in respect to the planking.</p> <p id=\"b575-7\" pgmap=\"575\">As between plaintiff and defendants as to the obligation to pay Shoemaker &amp; Co., the defendants were their principals, and plaintiff surety: plaintiff could therefore maintain a bill to compel the defendants to discharge their obligation to Shoemaker &amp; Co. Brandt on Guaranty and Suretyship, Sec. 223; Moore v. Topliff, 107 Ill. 211.</p> <p id=\"b575-8\" pgmap=\"575\">We do not think it necessary that any reformation of the instrument signed by the parties be made; plaintiff in error is entitled to relief upon the case it has made. The decree of the Circuit Court will be reversed, with directions to enter a decree directing the defendants to pay into court the appraised value of the planking as found by the appraisers, with interest thereon at five per cent per annum from May 1, 1892, and to execute a lease of said premises in accordance with the instrument signed by the parties, bearing date February 2,1892, the same to be prepared and executed by the plaintiff.</p> <p id=\"b575-9\" pgmap=\"575(11) 576(40)\">If plaintiff in error shall present to the Circuit Court satisfactory evidence that it has discharged its obligation to Shoemaker &amp; Co. in respect to said planking, plaintiff will then be entitled to the money, to be paid into court on account thereof by defendants in error. Reversed with directions.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
