Of these ten witnesses but one was at the time of testifying in the service of the company; three, including this one, were in its service when the accident happened.</p> <p id=\"b384-9\" pgmap=\"384\">Appellee called a police officer, and his testimony not sustaining appellee\u2019s account of the occurrence, she attempted to introduce a police minute book showing a report made by such officer of the accident. It appeared that the police officer made to the desk sergeant a report of the accident, and that the desk sergeant committed to writing what was told to him.</p> <p id=\"b384-10\" pgmap=\"384\">We do not think that this report can be considered by us in arriving at a conclusion in this case. The very great preponderance of the evidence is with the appellant. Appellee, if entirely uninfluenced by her position in the case, can not be presumed to have had a more accurate remembrance of the circumstances leading to the accident thaw the other witn\u00e9sses.</p> <p id=\"b384-11\" pgmap=\"384\">It is true that juries are not to count witnesses so much as to weigh what they say; and a reviewing court must bear in mind, that to a jury is the determination of the question of fact committed.</p> <p id=\"b384-12\" pgmap=\"384(29) 385(21)\">Nevertheless we can not fail to notice wherein, not the mere preponderance, but the great preponderance of the .evidence lies. There is not in the statements of the witnesses for appellant anything inherently improbable, nor does it appear that they have any reason for being biased or testifying untruthfully.</p> <p id=\"b385-4\" pgmap=\"385\">The judgment obtained, $14,200, is a large one, and we think that the evidence presented by this record is such that the cause should be committed for another trial. The judgment of the Circuit Court is reversed and the cause is remanded.</p> </opinion> <opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\"> <author id=\"b385-5\" pgmap=\"385\">Mr. Presiding Justice Shepard,</author> <p id=\"AL6\" pgmap=\"385\">dissenting.</p> <p id=\"b385-6\" pgmap=\"385\">On the question that the verdict was against the weight of evidence, which is the view the majority of the court take, I do not agree. The jury and the trial judge saw and heard the witnesses and observed their manner of testifying, and I prefer to rely upon their conclusion rather than upon a conclusion arrived at from a bare reading of their testimony. The damages are great\u00e9r than the evidence seems to justify, and on that account, alone, if at all, can a reversal of the judgment be justified, in my opinion. But before reversing on that ground, I would afford opportunity to appellee to remit in this court, down to a more reasonable sum.</p> <author id=\"b385-7\" pgmap=\"385\">Mr. Justice Gary.</author> <p id=\"b385-8\" pgmap=\"385\">This case is substantially like Goss &amp; Phillips Mfg. Co. v. Suelan, 35 Ill. App. 78, and North Chicago St. Ry. Co. v. Lotz, 44 Ill. App. 78.</p> <p id=\"b385-9\" pgmap=\"385\">The appellee\u2019s case stands only upon her own uncorroborated testimony; for that of the other witness mentioned by Judge \"Waterman, is so contradictory in itself, that it can not fairly he regarded as corroborative of anything.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
