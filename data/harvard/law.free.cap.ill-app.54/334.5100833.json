On the 28th day of September, at the same term, appellant specially appeared and moved the court to quash the summons and to vacate the judgment entered by default. The sheriff asked leave to amend his return on the summons. His motion was in the following words :</p><p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b333-4\" pgmap=\"333\">\u201c And now comes James H. Gilbert, sheriff of said Cook county, and moves the court for leave to amend the return made by said sheriff on the summons in the above entitled cause, by making such return read as follows, according to the facts: 1 Served this writ on the within named defendant, Montana Columbian Club, by delivering a copy thereof to R. B. Duncan, manager and general agent of said defendant, Montana Columbian Club, on the 8th day of September, A. D. 1893, the president or any clerk or secretary or superintendent of said defendant, Montana Columbian Club, not found in my county.' \"</p><p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b333-6\" pgmap=\"333\">In support of his motion he filed the following affidavit:</p><p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b333-7\" pgmap=\"333\">\u201c On the 8th day of September, A. D. 1893, I duly served the writ of summons upon said defendant, the Montana Columbian Club, by delivering a copy thereof to R. B. Duncan, who is the manager, and who had sole charge and control of said club, the president of said club not being found in my county. In making the return of the service I inadvertently wrote the name * California5 instead of \u2018 Montana.5 55</p><p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b333-8\" pgmap=\"333\">In support of its motion to quash the summons and to set aside the default and judgment, appellant read the affidavit of Bred L. Brooks, who states that he is the secretary of the Montana Columbian Club; thatT. S. Corrigan is the treasurer and that they both reside in the city of Chicago and county of Cook, and were in the said city and county at the time of the service of the summons in this case, and that Robert B. Duncan \u201c is not now and never has been an officer or agent of said company, but merely an employe at said club house.\u201d</p><p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b333-9\" pgmap=\"333(65) 334(27)\">Appellant also filed and read the affidavit of Robert B. Duncan in support of its motion. Duncan swears in his affidavit that he was employed by the Montana Columbian Club, and that his duties confine him in and about the rooms of said club building; that he told the deputy sheriff, when he called at the club house to serve the summons, that \u201c he was only an employe'of said company and could not accept service, and then and there informed said sheriff where' the officers of said club could be found.\u201d</p><p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b334-5\" pgmap=\"334\">Upon the reading of the affidavits the court granted leave to the sheriff to amend his return, and overruled the motion of appellant to quash the summons and to set aside and vacate the default and judgment. The sheriff then amended his return on the summons to read as follows:</p><p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b334-6\" pgmap=\"334\">\u201c Served this writ on the within-named defendant, Montana Columbian Club, by delivering a copy thereof to E.
