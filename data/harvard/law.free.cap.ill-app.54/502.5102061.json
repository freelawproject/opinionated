D. 1893, the sum of one hundred and twenty dollars ($120), and on the Thursday of each and every week thereafter the sum of fifteen dollars ($15), as alimony, during the pendency of this suit, until the further order of this court.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b501-8\" pgmap=\"501\">The record contains no evidence tending to support the conclusion that it was \u201c equitable and just that the defendant should pay the complainant the sum of fifteen dollars ($15) per week as alimony,\u201d nor is the recital of that conclusion a finding of any fact.</p> <p id=\"b501-9\" pgmap=\"501\">In substance it is like the recital in Baird v. Bowers, 131 Ill. 66, \u201c that the complainant is entitled to the relief,\u201d etc. The decree is reversed and the cause remanded.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
