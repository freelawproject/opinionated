The extent of this right is in dispute and is not determined by the notations of encumbrances upon the plaintiff\u2019s registration certificate, for although it is there stated that the land is subject to the easement \u201cof a drift way\u201d set forth in a certain deed from Spear to Hobart in 1855, it is further stated that the \u201cRight of Way\u201d shown on the plan accompanying the certificate \u201cis also subject to the rights of all those lawfully entitled thereto.\u201d The master does not find that the defendant\u2019s easement is in fact a \u201cdrift way\u201d as described in the Spear-Hobart deed. It may be one of the \u201crights of all those lawfully entitled thereto\u201d apart from that deed. These rights are not defined in the certificate of title.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-6\">The master does not set forth the precise origin of the defendant\u2019s easement, so that its terms can be stated with accuracy, doubtless because the evidence was not such as to enable him to do so. He endeavors to ascertain the nature of the defendant\u2019s rights from the nature of the actual use of the way for many years and from references in ancient deeds which he uses as evidence only and which need not be set forth in detail here.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-7\">Since it is the defendant who relies upon the easement, the burden rests upon him to show that his right is extensive' enough to authorize the amount and character of the use which he has made of the way. <em>Hooten </em>v. <em>Barnard, </em>137 Mass. 36. <em>Bigelow Carpet Co. </em>v. <em>Wiggin, </em>209 Mass. 542, 547, 551. <em>Mt. Holyoke Realty Corp. </em>v. <em>Holyoke Realty Corp. </em>284 Mass. 100, 105.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-8\">The master finds that the way has been used for teaming cordwood and fence posts from the back land and at one <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>time for carting dressing to two or three gardens located there and carting out produce from them. \"Some seventy-five years ago\" sand was carted out \"by horse and team\u201d at the rate of \u201ctwo or three loads every two or three years for a period of six or seven years.\u201d More recently some peat and other material have been taken out. During the past few years a casual load of gravel has been taken out by truck. For two or three years before the defendant purchased the back land the way was not used at all and became overgrown with grass, brush and bushes, although it was still distinctly visible on the land. It is clear that during the many years of the existence of the way, its use was intermittent and generally infrequent, except perhaps when cordwood was being cut and carted off. The way is, however, the only present means of access to a large tract of land.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-5\">The master makes an ultimate finding as to the nature of the defendant\u2019s right of way in these words: \"Upon all the evidence I find that the right is impressed with the limitation that it must be used with reasonable regard to the comfort and enjoyment of the owner of the servient estate, and not in such manner as to disturb his peace or the value of his property.\u201d Since the evidence in general is not reported, and this finding is not in conflict with subsidiary findings, it must stand, indefinite as it is, as a limitation upon the defendant\u2019s rights. <em>MacLeod </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>290 Mass. 335, 338. <em>Dodge </em>v. <em>Anna Jaques Hospital, </em>301 Mass. 431, 435. <em>Zak </em>v. <em>Zak, </em>305 Mass. 194, 196. But the finding must be construed fairly with the whole situation in mind. We do not think it means that every trifling disturbance of the plaintiff or the least possible detriment to his property is prohibited. A right of way so strictly limited could hardly be exercised at all. The sentence quoted should be balanced by implying the adverb \"substantially\u201d before the verb \u201cto disturb.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b626-6\">The master reports these further facts: After the defendant purchased the back land, about April 1, 1939, he widened the used portion of the way, including that part on the plaintiff\u2019s premises, to a width sufficient for two <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>trucks to pass each other, and he placed gravel and sand upon it. By the time this suit was brought his sand and gravel operations had reached such proportions that thirty or forty truck loads passed out in a day, making from sixty to eighty trips out and in. This \u201cperforce\u201d raised \u201clarge clouds of dust,\u201d diminished in some degree near the plaintiff\u2019s house by the defendant\u2019s use of calcium chloride upon the surface of the way. The trucks, \u201cfrom the very nature of the mechanism,\u201d make \u201ca considerable amount of noise\u201d in passing the plaintiff\u2019s house. This use of the way has interfered with the comfortable enjoyment of the plaintiff\u2019s premises. \u201cThe noise and dust ... is not a reasonable use of the way in consideration of the rights established in the original instance.\u201d The defendant \u201chas attempted to burden the servient estate to an unreasonable degree.\u201d The plaintiff has \u201csuffered a nuisance\u201d from dust and noise.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-5\">Upon the facts found by the master the plaintiff is entitled to a decree. It is true that the defendant has established the existence of an easement in his favor which seems on the findings not to have been confined to use for any specified purpose or purposes, but within reasonable limits may be inferred to have comprehended general use as a way for purposes compatible with the nature of a tract of woodland separated from the public road, but subject to the limitations found by the master. We are not prepared to say that the defendant cannot haul out any sand or gravel, but on the findings the defendant\u2019s present use of the way for the carrying on of a practically continuous business of mining sand and gravel on the wood lot exceeds any privilege shown to have been acquired, amounts to a new servitude, and overloads the easement. <em>Atwater </em>v. <em>Bodfish, </em>11 Gray, 150, 152. <em>Sargent </em>v. <em>Hubbard, </em>102 Mass. 380. <em>Parks </em>v. <em>Bishop, </em>120 Mass. 340. <em>Rowell </em>v. <em>Doggett, </em>143 Mass. 483. <em>Baldwin </em>v. <em>Boston &amp; Maine Railroad, </em>181 Mass. 166, 169. <em>Randall </em>v. <em>Grant, </em>210 Mass. 302. <em>Cornell-Andrews Smelting Co. </em>v. <em>Boston &amp; Providence Railroad, </em>215 Mass. 381, 389.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-6\">We have not overlooked the general rule that when a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>right of way arises by grant and not by prescription and is not limited by the terms of the grant, \u201cit is available for the reasonable uses to which the dominant estate may be devoted.\u201d <em>Parsons </em>v. <em>New York, New Haven &amp; Hartford Railroad, </em>216 Mass. 269, 273. <em>Anzalone </em>v. <em>Metropolitan District Commission, </em>257 Mass. 32, 36. The peculiarity of the case at bar is that the existence of a right of way of some kind is conceded, but no deed of grant has been identified by which to measure its terms. Indeed, so far as appears the right may have originated in prescription and not in grant. In a case like this the right cannot be assumed to be more extensive than the proof shows it to be.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-5\">The decree should not,, however, have limited the defendant\u2019s use to that of a driftway. Strictly speaking, and as generally defined in the dictionaries, a driftway seems to be a way to be used for driving cattle. <em>Ballard </em>v. <em>Dyson, </em>1 Taunt. 279. <em>Cannon </em>v. <em>Villars, </em>8 Ch. D. 415, 421. No doubt the context may sometimes indicate a broader meaning. <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Ladd, </em>41 Maine, 314, 320. The earliest deeds referring to the way do not describe it as a driftway. The master finds that the two later deeds which do refer to it as such were not deeds by which the defendant\u2019s rights originated. So far as appears the way has never been used for the driving of cattle, and none of the uses found to have been made of it is strictly a use as a driftway. The master has not found that the defendant\u2019s rights are those of a driftway. To limit the defendant\u2019s use to a driftway is inconsistent, we think, with the tenor of the master\u2019s findings. Instead of this the decree should enjoin the defendant from using the way for the hauling of quantities of sand or gravel to such an extent or in such manner as substantially to disturb the peace of the occupants of the plaintiff\u2019s property or substantially to decrease its value. In this respect the defendant\u2019s use of the way has exceeded any right that the findings show him to possess.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-6\">The decree went too far in entirely prohibiting the use by the defendant of motor trucks. It cannot be assumed that \u201creasonable regard to the comfort and enjoyment of the owner of the servient estate\u201d and the securing of his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>\u201cpeace\u201d and the \u201cvalue of his property\u201d are necessarily and forever inconsistent with any use whatsoever of motor trucks under any conceivable conditions of speed, weight, frequency, and of the future surface of the way itself. Three of the five ancient deeds mentioning the right of way refer to passing \u201cwith teams and other ways\u201d or use equivalent words. We should be very slow to hold that even ancient rights of way, not expressly restricted as to the type of vehicle <em>(Clarkin </em>v. <em>Duggan, </em>292 Mass. 263), could not be employed at all for the means of transportation in common use by a succeeding generation. See <em>Crosier </em>v. <em>Shack, </em>213 Mass. 253. This clause of the decree should be omitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-5\">Another paragraph of the decree enjoins the defendant from causing, or allowing any use of the way which by reason of noise or dust will constitute a nuisance. The plaintiff is entitled to this relief in substance. The wording of this part of the decree, however, is open to the objection that it requires the defendant to define the legal meaning of \u201cnuisance\u201d at his peril and tends to transfer the controversy to future contempt proceedings. <em>Guillet </em>v. <em>Livernois, </em>297 Mass. 337, 341. It must be conceded that in cases involving acts in the nature of nuisances it is often difficult to frame a decree that is much more than a paraphrase of words commonly employed to define a nuisance. Nevertheless, we think it better practice to make the attempt, and in this case at least to follow more closely the findings of the master. This paragraph of the decree is to be modified by enjoining the defendant from so using the way as substantially to disturb the peace, comfort, or enjoyment of persons of ordinary sensibilities occupying the plaintiff\u2019s premises or unreasonably to diminish the value of the plaintiff\u2019s property. See <em>Stevens </em>v. <em>Rockport Granite Co. </em>216 Mass. 486, 488, 492; <em>Marshall </em>v. <em>Holbrook, </em>276 Mass. 341, 348.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-6\">Since the only appeal filed by the defendant was filed more than twenty days after the confirmation of the master\u2019s report, G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 214, \u00a7\u00a7 19, 26, it would seem to have the effect of an appeal from the final decree only. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number><em>Hays </em>v. <em>Georgian Inc. </em>280 Mass. 10, 15. Even if the defendant\u2019s objections to the master\u2019s report are fully open now, we find no error in respect to them which should have prevented the confirmation of the report or which affects the final decree.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-3\">\n<em>Decree as modified affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
