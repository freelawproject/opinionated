The deceased was a passenger in an automobile driven by the defendant on \u201cConcord Turnpike\u201d in Lincoln on July 29, 1937, at about 9:10 p.m., when the automobile ran off the road, and in returning to the road, tipped, rolled over twice, and stopped on its side, facing in the direction from which it had come.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-5\">There was evidence tending to show that the automobile left its right hand side of the straight, level, four-lane cement highway in front of or near a \u201cvegetable stand,\u201d so that the left wheels went as far as seven feet off the edge of the road. The wheel marks on the ground described an arc about eighty-five feet long from the road back to the road again with \u201cscrape marks\u201d on the road itself extending about twenty feet farther to the place where the automobile was found. The entrance to the stand where the marks were \u201cwas about one hundred feet,\u201d and the surface was of hard gravel or dirt, level with the roadway. It was a \u201cnice clear summer\u2019s night.\u201d The highest estimate of the defendant\u2019s speed was \u201cabout forty-five or fifty miles an hour.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b635-6\">A State police officer testified that he went to the scene of the accident and talked with the defendant; that the lights on the defendant\u2019s automobile were not lighted and the switch was on; that he himself turned the lights on and the switch off. The defendant testified that he stayed about five minutes at the place of the accident, and paid no attention to his automobile after it tipped over; that it was dark enough for headlights; that his headlights were lighted; that with his headlights on he could see one hundred sixty feet; but that he did not see the automobile ahead of him hereinafter mentioned until he was about twenty-five feet from it.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-7\">The defendant\u2019s story of the accident was that while travelling thirty-five or forty miles an hour in the right hand lane he saw an automobile, which had \u201capparently\u201d come from the opposite direction, making a \u201cU-turn\u201d in front <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>of him to go in the same direction in which he was going; that when he saw this automobile it was right across his lane of travel headed toward the woods at his right side of the road and going \u201cvery, very slowly,\u201d if it was moving at all; that he turned to the right off the road, and his \u201cfront tire blew\u201d; that he tipped over in turning back upon the road beyond this automobile; that he saw no lights on the automobile that was across his path. He told the police officer that its headlights \u201cwere headed into the woods so that it was not visible in the dark.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b636-5\">The meaning of the evidence as it appears in the report is not clear at all points. There was some evidence from which the jury might well have found that considerable time had elapsed before the police officer, as he testified, arrived at the scene and turned on the defendant\u2019s headlights, so that the lights might have been tampered with before he came. But upon the evidence already narrated, including the defendant\u2019s failure to see an automoible in front of him until he was twenty-five feet from it, we cannot quite say as a matter of law that there was no evidence for the jury that the defendant was driving without lights. The probabilities are not for us to decide.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-6\">There was somewhat conflicting evidence as to the degree of darkness at the time, but in addition to evidence that it was \u201cdark\u201d we may draw upon our own knowledge that in this latitude very little daylight remains at about 9:10 p.m. on July 29. The sun had set over an hour before. We cannot say as matter of law that it is not grossly negligent to drive without turning on lights on a main highway in darkness substantially that of night at a speed of from forty-five to fifty miles an hour and to run off the road under the circumstances which could here be found. Failure to use the lights is more than a momentary lapse of care. We think this case distinguishable from <em>Lynch </em>v. <em>Springfield Safe Deposit &amp; Trust Co. </em>294 Mass. 170, and from the cases relied upon by the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-7\">\n<em>Judgment on the verdicts.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
