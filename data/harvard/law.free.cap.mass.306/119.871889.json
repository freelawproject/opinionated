On direct examination she testified, as we construe her language, that on the fourth step from the top she stepped on a piece of wood two inches in height and fell. On cross-examination she testified that all she knew was that when she went to put her foot on the second step she felt something hard, but did not know what it was.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-6\">The plaintiff\u2019s brother testified that he returned home and got up to his tenement just as the plaintiff came out and started down the stairs; that as he had come into the house from the \u201cdoor onto the step\u201d he had seen \u201cone of the working men\u201d carrying down the stairway a nail barrel \u201coverfilled\u201d with pieces of wood, \u201cstuff from plaster and pieces of wall and stuff from lime\u201d; that this man was dressed as a workingman; that the witness had often seen bim carrying materials down the stairway between March 25 and April 12; that the witness saw this man drop four or five pieces of wood on the stairs; that when the witness told him some one might get hurt the man replied, \u201cI don\u2019t care\u201d; that some of the pieces of wood were \u201ctwo fingers\u201d or more high; that after he went into his tenement he heard a noise, ran down stairs, and found the plaintiff lying on the floor; and that he then saw the wood on the stairs.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-7\">In our opinion there was evidence for the jury. Although the plaintiff\u2019s testimony was not altogether consistent, and if we assume without deciding that she was bound by her last statement on cross-examination that all she knew was that when she put her foot on the second step she felt \u201csomething hard,\u201d <em>Sullivan </em>v. <em>Boston Elevated Railway, </em>224 Mass. 405, still the juiy, taking her testimony in connection with that of her brother, and believing both, could find that the \u201csomething hard\u201d was a piece of. wood or plaster which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>had been negligently dropped a few minutes before by the workman and negligently allowed by him to remain upon the stairway. They could also find that the workman was one of the men employed by the defendant in connection with the renovation of the building, and that it was part of his work to remove from the building such material as was in the nail barrel. <em>Power </em>v. <em>Beattie, </em>194 Mass. 170, 175, 176. They could find that the plaintiff was properly upon the premises under the right of her brother, who was a tenant of the defendant. <em>Gallagher </em>v. <em>Murphy, </em>221 Mass. 363, 364. <em>Russo </em>v. <em>Rizzo, </em>302 Mass. 177. See <em>Coupe </em>v. <em>Platt, </em>172 Mass. 458; <em>Webber </em>v. <em>Sherman, </em>254 Mass. 402, 403. No argument has been made that the plaintiff was not in the exercise of due care. If the jury made these possible findings the defendant would properly be held liable for the negligence of its own employee. <em>Watkins </em>v. <em>Goodall, </em>138 Mass. 533, 536. <em>Caruso </em>v. <em>Lebowich, </em>251 Mass. 477, 478, 479. <em>Henebury </em>v. <em>Cabot, </em>288 Mass. 349, 352. <em>Martin </em>v. <em>Rich, </em>288 Mass. 437.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-5\">\n<em>Exceptions sustained.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
