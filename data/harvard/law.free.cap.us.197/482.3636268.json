Cotton to prosecute said claim. Mr. Cotton was a citizen of the District of Columbia.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b507-6\">Thereupon a form of contract was prepared and executed by the then Governor of Massachusetts, in behalf and under the seal of the Commonwealth, and by Cotton;'and a duplicate original thereof was deposited with the Secretary of the Treasury of the United States.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b507-7\">The prosecution of the claim was at once entered upon, and after five years was finally adjudicated, audited and passed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b507-8\">On or about May 2, 1904, the Treasury Department issued and delivered to Cotton,- as the duly authorized agent of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, war settlement warrant No. 11343, payable \"to the Governor of the State of Massachusetts, or order,\u201d for the sum of $1,611,740.85, and addressed \u201cP.

C.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b507-9\">Mr. Cotton notified the state attorney general of the delivery of the warrant to him, and that he was entitled to a lien upon the warrant for the amount of his fees under his contract; and the .Governor was informed to the same effect. Mr. Cottofi also notified the Secretary of the Treasury that he claimed a lien upon the. warrant for compensation in accordance with his contract. Subsequently, the Governor, Hon. John L. Bates, addressed a communication to the Secretary of the Treasury, in which he demanded that the warrant be cancelled and that a duplicate thereof be forwarded to him as Governor of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>Commonwealth. The Secretary declined to comply with the demand. Later Mr. Cotton filed a bill in the Suprenie Court of the District of Columbia against \u201cLeslie M. Shaw, Secretary, of the Treasury, and John L. Bates, Governor of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts,\u201d in which he asserted his. right to an attorney\u2019s lien upon the papers of his client, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, including the warrant,in question, and prayed, among other things, that said Leslie M. Shaw might be restrained and enjoined from cancelling the warrant which had been delivered to him, and from drawing or issuing a duplicate thereof to said Bates, and \u201cthat the defendant, John L. Bates, may be restrained and enjoined from asking, demanding or receiving from the defendant, Leslie M. Shaw, or any of his assistants, subordinates or clerks, a second or duplicate warrant as aforesaid.\u201d'</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b508-5\">\u25a0 The State of Massachusetts was not named as a party to this suit, and no relief was prayed against the State.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b508-6\">Upon the filing of this bill one of the justices of the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia entered a rule on the Secretary of the Treasury, requiring him to show cause why the relief prayed against him should not be granted, which was duly served, but has not yet come on for hearing. No process was served upon defendant Bates, who has since ceased to be Governor, and he has never appeared in the suit, nor has the Commonwealth of Massachusetts intervened therein in' any way.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b508-7\">'The Commonwealth of Massachusetts then filed a petition in this court, on leave, for writs of prohibition, mandamus and certiorari, to restrain the justices of the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia from taking further proceedings or entertaining jurisdiction in the equity suit.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b508-8\">In response to a rule entered on that petition, the Chief \u25a0 Justice and Associate Justices of the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia showed cause, and submitted, for reasons set forth, that, as'the case stood, the court ought not to be prevented from exercising jurisdiction.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b509-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number><em>Mr. Herbert Parker, </em>Attorney General of the State of Massachusetts, and <em>Mr. Frederick Ii.

The only court where the dispute between Cotton and the Commonwealth can be adjudicated is the Supreme Court of Massachusetts where the Commonwealth has consented to be impleaded. 11th Amendment, Const.

And it has not appellate jurisdiction, because since the passage of the act of February 9, 1893, 27 Stat. 434, c. 74, establishing the court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, this court, generally speaking, and not including cases arising under the bankruptcy law, <em>Audubon </em>v. <em>Shufeldt, </em>181 U.
