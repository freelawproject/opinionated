The applications of Blanchard and Cook were each rejected, as being in Conflict with White\u2019s entry., On April 27, 1889, Blanchard filed his affidavit of contest; .charging that White entered the Territory prior to twelve o\u2019clock noon of April 22, 1889, in violation of the act of Congress approved March 2, 1889, 25 Stat. 980, 1004, c. 412, and the President\u2019s Proclamation issued under that act. 26 Stat. 1544. On May 1, 1889, Cook also filed an affidavit of contest against White, alleging the latter\u2019s disqualification as above stated, to enter the land,, and also that Blanchard was also disqualified upon the same grounds as those alleged in reference to White.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b328-11\">The contest having been tried before the local land office\u2014 ea\u00e9h party charging that the other two bad entered the Terri<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>tory prior to noon of April 22,1889, \u2014 the Register and Receiver recommended the cancellation of White\u2019s entry, and dismissed the contest of both Blanchard and Cook. From this decision\\ all parties appealed to the Commissioner of the General Land Office, and on March 7, 1890, the decision of the local office was affirmed. An appeal was then taken to the Secretary of the Interior. While the case was pending before that offiber, namely, on November 29, 1890, White relinquished of record his entry, and Murphy, the defendant; on the same day,entered the land. The Secretary, of the Interior, July- 21, 1891,' affirmed the decision of the Commissioner of th\u00e9 General Land Office. <em>Blanchard </em>v. <em>White, </em>13 L.

That application was received, but it was suspended pending the contest of White, Blanchard and Cook. On the day last named McMichael filed a contest or protest, alleging that he had made settlement on the land on June 3; 1889, had lived there in \u00e1 tent with his family until August 2, 1889, Avhen, at the instance of White, he was forcibly removed therefrom by the military authorities; that his rights were superior to those of White, Blanchard and Cook, all of whom, he alleged, were disqualified \u25a0by reason of ha-ving entered the Territory during the period prohibited by law; that his application of June 3, was rejected because it conflicted with White\u2019s interests, although he' was the only qualified settler on the tract entitled to make entry. The case, as between McMichael and Murphy, having been heard on February 15, .1892, a decision was rendered in favor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>of the latter. Thereupon McMichael appealed to the General Land Office which, on January 18, 1893, affirmed the decision of the local office.

Murphy demurred on the ground that the petition did not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action \u2014 McMichael's claim being that the Secretary of the Interior had misconstrued and misapplied the law. The demurrer was sustained, and the plaintiff having elected to stand on his petition the court dismissed the case. From that decree the plaintiff brings the case here for review.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b330-6\">After the cause was entered in the Supreme Court of the Territory McMichael died and the cause was revived in the name of his heirs.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b330-7\"><em>Mr. Joseph K.

Under these circumstances he was, in contemplation of law, in possession of and a settler upon the land from May 28, 1889, continuously throughout the period covered by the transactions described in his petition.' His tempoT rary absence from part of the land, wrongfully compelled by military force and induced by intimidation, did not break the continuity of his residence. <em>Dorgan </em>v. <em>Pitt, </em>6 L.

All of the defendants, having been either parties to these unlawful transactions, or privy thereto, must be regarded as having taken, and as holding the legal title, as trustees for, and should be compelled to convey the said land to, the heirs of McMichael.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AJa\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>Under the circumstances McMichael\u2019s remedy was by petition to a court of equity for the securing and protection of his rights, which were not cognizable by a court of law.

That Proclamation contains the following clause: \u201cWarning is hereby again expressly given, that no person entering upon and occupying said lands before said hour of twelve o\u2019clock, noon, of the twenty-second day of April, A. D. eighteen hundred and eighty-nine, hereinbefore fixed, will ever be permitted to enter, any of said lands or acquire any rights thereto; and that the officers of the United States will be required to strictly enforce the provision of the act of Congress to the above effect.\u201d 26 Stat. 1544, 1546.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-5\">It may be assumed, for the purpose of this case, that White entered the Territory and occupied the land before noon of April 22, 1889, in violation of the act of Congress and the Proclamation of the President. But his entry did not, on its face or in the papers connected therewith, disclose the fact of his personal disqualification to make a valid entry. While the entry remained uncancelled of record by any direct action of the Land Office or by relinquishment, could another person, by making an entry, acquire a right in the land upon which a patent could be based? If not, then'McMichael acquired n\u00f3 right by his entry or application to enter.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-6\">The Supreme Court of the Territory held that White\u2019s homestead entry was <em>prima facie </em>valid, and that so long as White\u2019s entry remained uncancelled of record it segregated the tract of land from the mass of the public domain and precluded McMiehael from acquiring an inceptive right thereto by virtue of his alleged settlement.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-7\">We are of opinion that there was no error in this ruling. It is supported by the adjudged cases. <em>Kansas Pacific Ry. Co. </em>v. <em>Dunmeyer, </em>113 U. S. 629; <em>Hastings &amp;c. R. R. </em>v. <em>Whitney, </em>132 U. S. 357, 361, 362; <em>Sioux City &amp;c. Land Company </em>v. <em>Griffey, 143 </em>U. S. 32, 38; <em>Whitney </em>v. <em>Taylor, </em>158 U.

S. 622, 634, 635; and <em>Hodges </em>v. <em>Colcord, </em>193 U. S. 192, 194-196.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-8\">In the last named case the question now before us was di.rectly presented and decided. It was there alleged that one' <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>Gayman, jvho had made a homestead entry, was disqualified ^\u00bfreason of his having entered the Territory of Oklahoma ih. violation of the above act of Congress and:the Proclamation of the President. ' The court said: \u201cGayman\u2019s homestead entry was <em>prima facie </em>valid. There was nothing on the-face- of the record to show th\u00bft he had entered the Territory prior to the' time fixed for the opening thereof for settlement, or that he had in any manner violated the statute or the Proclamation of the President. This <em>prima facie_ </em>valid entry removed the land, temporarily at least, out of the public domain, and beyond the reach of other homestead entries. . . . Generally, a homestead entry while it remains uncancelled withdraws the land from subsequent entry. Such has\u2019 been the ruling of the Land Department. . . . The entry of Gay-man, though ineffectual to vest any rights in him, and therefore void as to him, was such a4 entry as prevented the acquisition of homestead rights by another until it had been set \u00bfside.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AXT\">Following the adjudged cases, we hold that White\u2019s original entry was <em>prima facie </em>valid, that is, valid on the face of the record, and McMicha\u00e9l\u2019s entry, having been made at a time when White\u2019s entry remained uncancelled, or not relinquished, of record, conferred no right upon him, for the reason that White\u2019s entry, so long as it remained undisturbed, of record, had the effect to segregate the lands from the public domain and make them not subject to entry.' Upon White\u2019s relinquishment they again became public lands, subject to the entry made by Murphy.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-4\">\u2022 In addition, it may be observed that the action of the. Land Department und\u00e9r the statutes relating to the public l\u00e1nds has been in line with the above views. This appears from the decision ip <em>Hodges </em>v. <em>Colcord, </em>and from the opinion of the Secretary of the Interior in <em>McMichael </em>v. <em>Murphy, </em>20 L. D. 147. It is our duty not to overrule the construction of a statute upon which the Land Department has.uniformly proceeded,. in its administration of the public lands, - except for cogent reasons. <em>United </em>States v.
