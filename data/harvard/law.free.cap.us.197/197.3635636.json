I of the Constitution of the United States, by reason of its being an <em>ex post facto </em>law, as applicable to the judgments of the judge. <em>Powell </em>v. <em>Brunswick County, </em>150 U.

No definite issue as to the validity of the statute is distinctly deducible from the record so as to present a Federal question. <em>Powell </em>v. <em>Brunswick County, </em>150 U.

(2) That the wife of the Circuit Judge had died ten years prior to the bringing of -that suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-6\">The petition to vacate the decree was denied July 13, 1901, by the Circuit Court, and its decree to that effect was affirmed by the Supreme Court, November 17, 1903 (the case having beep submitted March 31, 1902), whereupon this writ of error was allowed, and comes before us on a motion to dismiss for want of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-7\">The state Supreme Court delivered no opinion in affirming the decree denying the petition to vacate, and the record discloses no title, right, privilege or immunity specially set up or claimed under the Constitution or any law of the United States, which was denied by the decision; nor any assertion of an infraction of the Fourteenth Amendment, or any provision of the Constitution. But it is said that by necessary intendment the validity of an act of the general assembly of Florida of May 30, 1901, was drawn in question as repugnant to the Constitution of the United 'States, and its validity sustained. The act referred to provided.that section.970 of the Revised Statutes of Florida was thereby amended so as to read: \u201cAny and all judgments, decrees and orders heretofore or hereafter rendered in causes where the disqualifications appear of record in the cause, shall be void, but where the dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>qualification does not so appear, they shall not be subject- to collateral attack.\u201d Session Laws, Florida, 1901, p. 39.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-5\">The contention is that the judgment of the Supreme Court proceeded upon this act, which was invalid, if so applied, because <em>ex post facto, </em>and that, therefore, this court has jurisdiction, inasmuch as the validity of the act was thus drawn in question and its validity sustained. Yet no' definite issue as to the validity of that statute was distinctly deducible from the record, no decision in favor of its validity appeared therefrom, and the judgment might have rested on grounds not involving its validity.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-6\">Whether the Supreme Court of Florida, if it sustained the decree of the Circuit Court in denying the petition on either \u25a0 of the grounds set up in defense, committed error cognizable here, or whether the act referred to was applied as asserted in contravention of,the. Constitution of the United States, we are not called on to consider, since we do not find that any Federal question was so raised, on the petition or in the proceedings thereunder, at the proper time and in the proper way, as to give us jurisdiction under section 709 of the Revised Statutes. <em>Mutual Life Insurance Company </em>v. <em>McGrew, </em>188 U. S. 291, 307, 308; <em>Powell </em>v. <em>Brunswick County, 150 </em>U. S. 433; <em>Sayward </em>v. <em>Denny, </em>158 U.
