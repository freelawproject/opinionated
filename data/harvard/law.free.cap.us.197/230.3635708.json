Stat., are broad enough to include- the whole of a city on.those shores and within the limits named. The Collection \u25a0 District of Georgetown includes the whole of the city of Washington, D. C., and the Secretary of the Treasury has no power, general' or statutory, under \u00a7 \u00a7 3657, 3658, Rev. Stat., to appoint, and allow compensation to, a disbursing agent for funds appropriated for building a post office in Washington.</syllabus>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"Ack\">The facts are stated in the opinion.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b254-9\"><em>Mr. J.

They are not otherwise defined by law. The Secretary of the Treasury did not prescribe the duties of disbursing agent for the Post Office, Washington, D. C., as part of or additional to the duties of appellant as disbursing clerk '-of the Treasury Department. On the contrary the Secretary separates the former from the latter, by the terms of appellant\u2019s appointment as disbursing agent for the Post Office. Rev. Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 173, 174, 176.</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b254-12\">The city of Washington, in the District of Columbia, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>place of the location of the public work, was not the place Uf the location of the port of Georgetown, in the District of Columbia, for the purpose of making disbursements for the Post Office building at the city of Washington. No collector of customs was'located at the city of Washington, the place of the public work. Sections 2550, 2551, 3658, Rev.

Sections 3657, 3658, 255, Rev. Stat. and act of August 7, 1882, 22 Stat. 306, govern the case. As to collector in Washington see \u00a7\u00a72550, 2551, Rev. Stat., 28 Stat. 650; as to salaried officers of the United States receiving compensation for discharging duties of any other office see \u00a7\u00a7 1760, 1763-1765, Rey. Stat.; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Saunders, </em>120 U. S. 126.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b255-8\">The act making appropriations fqr the construction of this post office required the Secretary of the Treasury to disburse the money and did not contain any provision whatever for payment of compensation for such service. 26 Stat. 174, 413; 27 Stat. 351, 573; 28 Stat. 373, 913; 29 .Stat. 415; 30 Stat. 13. No office of disbursing agent was created by those acts. In the execution thereof and in conformity with the duty thus conferred, the Secretary of the Treasury appointed the disbursing clerk of the Treasury Department to make these disbursements.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b255-9\">At the time these services were rendered appellant was an officer in the public service, and, as such, was receiving pay or salary as fixed by law. He was the proper officer and the one naturally to be selected for these duties, which, as stated by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>the court below, \u201cwere not only germane to his regular duties as disbursing clerk, but were identical therewith, and hence they cannot be considered-as two distinct offices or employments having different duties.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b256-5\">Mr. Justice Holmes</author>\n<p id=\"Agm\">delivered the opinion of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-6\">This is an appeal from a judgment of the Court of Claims rejecting the claim of the appellant. 39 C. Cl. 338. The claimant while a disbursing clerk of the Treasury Department received a letter from the Secretary of the Treasury, as follows: \u201cGeorge A. Bartlett, disbursing clerk, Treasury Department, Washington, D. C. Sir: You are hereby appointed disbursing agent for such, funds as may be advanced to you from time to time on account of the appropriation for post-office, Washington, D. C. You will be entitled to such compensation for the services named as is provided by law, and the same rate of compensation will be allowed on all amounts disbursed by you since October 15, 1891, on account of the appropriation named.\u201d Directions . followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-7\">\u25a0 The claimant gave no new bond and took no additional oath of office. He proceeded to disburse nearly two and a half millions of dollars and claims three-eighths of one per' cent upon the sum disbursed.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-8\">The claimant puts his right to compensation on two grounds, the general powers of the Secretary of the Treasury apart from statute, and Rev. Stat. \u00a7 3658. As to the dormer it is enough to say that whatever power the Secretary might have, in the absence of legislation, Congress has dealt with the subject so fully that it is plain that we must look to the statutes alone. Rev. -Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 1760-1765, 3657, 3658, 255. Act of August 7, 1882, c. 433 ; 22 Stat. 302, 306. Looking to the statutes, the claimant relies on Rev. Stat. \u00a73658: \u201cWhen there is no collector at the place of location of any public work specified in the preceding section [which section specifies post-offices], the-Secretary of the Treasury may appoint a disbursing agent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>for the payment of all moneys appropriated for the 'construction of any such public work, with such compensation as he may deem equitable and just.\u201d It is urged that there is no collector at Washington, the place of location of the public work concerned.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-5\">The statutes as to .the collector for Washington are as follows: Rev. Stat. \u00a72550. \u201cThere shall be in the District of Columbia one collection-district, as follows: The district of Georgetown; to comprise all the waters and shores of' the Potomac River within the State of Maryland and the District of Columbia from Pomonkey Creek to the head of the navigable waters of that river; in which Georgetown shall be the port of entry.\u201d \u00a72551. \u201cThere- shall be in the district of Georgetown a collector.\u201d It appears from \u00a7 2550 that the collection district of Georgetown is more extensive than the city of Georgetown. And this- is not changed by the later statute making Georgetown a part of Washington. Act of February 11, 1895, c. 79, 28 Stat. 650. We do not perceive on what ground it is denied that the Washington post office is within this district. The words, \u201cshores of the Potomac River,\u201d seem to us broad enough to include the whole of a city on those sh'ores and within the other limits named. \u201cWaters and shores\u201d is the usual phrase in Rev. Stat. Title 34, c. 1, \u00a7\u00a72517-2612. The words \u201cin which\u201d assume that Georgetown' is embraced within the district. If within the district it is so simply because it is on the shores as that word is used in \u00a7 2550, and if Georgetown is within it Washington is in it also, on the same ground. The same form of expression and the same assumption constantly recur in other sections. To show still further that collection districts run inland and are not limited to the mathematical line which bounds the water, it may be observed that, while \u201cwaters and shores\u201d is the most common expression, a district frequently is declared to include towns; e. .g., \u00a72517, Seventh, Thirteenth; \u00a72522; \u00a72531, First, Second; \u00a72533, First. It may include lands,. \u00a72519; or embrace a county, \u00a72517, First, Sixth; or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>even a State, \u00a7 2522. If Washington is within the collection district, then there was a collector at the place of location of the Washington .post office, see \u00a7 3657, and the authority of the Secretary to appoint a disbursing agent under \u00a7 3658 was. excluded by its very words.</p>\n<p id=\"AU7\">The claimant does not contend that his case gets any appreciable help from the act of August 7, 1882, c. 433, 22 Stat. 306. That gives the compensation allowed by law to collectors of customs to disbursing agents appointed to disburse-any appropriation for any United States post office or other buildings, \u201cnot located within the city of Washington.\u201d No-other statute is relied upon. No doubt the Secretary was under the impression, when the letter was written, that he was making an appointment which would entitle the claimant to distinct compensation for new work and responsibility. Undid not regard the claimant as designated to be disbursing agent within the claimant\u2019s district under Rev.- Stat. \u00a7 255;. and therefore as not entitled to any additional pay. Rev. Stat. .\u00a7\u00a7 1764, 1765. But we do not see how the Case can be put any higher. It is.agreed that the claimant was not appointed to a new office by the Secretary\u2019s letter. Therefore-ho help is to be got from <em>United States </em>v. <em>Saunders, </em>120 U. S. 126, 129. The case is a hard one, but we are of opinion that the decision of the Court of Claims was right.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed*</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
