We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-5\">Claimant compensably injured his left arm in June, 1980. The claim was closed by a 1982 determination order that awarded him permanent partial disability (PPD). Between 1983 and 1986, the claim was re-opened and re-closed four times. A February, 1984, order granted claimant additional PPD. Subsequent determination orders did not award any additional PPD, but did award him TTD from January 15, 1986, to March 3, 1986. Claimant\u2019s requests for hearings on the determination orders were dismissed in September, 1987. After he had received vocational training, a November, 1986, determination order awarded no additional PPD. In March 1987, claimant underwent a surgical procedure, and that claim was closed in February, 1988, without an award of additional PPD.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-6\">The Board describes what happened next:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b643-7\">\u201cOn or about February 23, 1988, claimant requested a hearing contesting a February 17, 1988 Determination Order. At the hearing, claimant requested that Referee Michael Johnson set aside four prior Determination Orders, which issued February 8, 1984, February 16, 1984, April 26, 1985, and November 18, 1986. Johnson [set aside the orders and] ordered payment of over $10,000 in what he characterized as temporary total disability compensation [for the period of September 6, 1983, to November 2, 1987]. SAIF did not pay. Claimant requested a hearing, seeking enforcement of Johnson\u2019s order. After a February 1989 hearing, Referee Harri ordered SAIF to pay the monies ordered by Johnson and assessed a 25 percent penalty and related attorney fee for SAIF\u2019s failure to comply.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b643-8\">\u201cSAIF did not pay. Claimant requested another hearing, seeking only penalties and related attorney fees. Referee Emerson awarded an additional 15 percent penalty and a related attorney fee for SAIF\u2019s failure to comply with Harri\u2019s enforcement order.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b643-9\">\u201cSAIF still did not pay. Claimant requested a fourth hearing, seeking penalties and attorney fees for SAIF\u2019s continued failure to comply with Harri\u2019s order. Referee Podnar, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>in WCB Case No. 89-14455, noted that Emerson had already penalized SAIF for refusing to comply with Harri\u2019s order. Podnar also noted that the most recent order requiring payment of anything other than penalties and associated attorney fees was Harri\u2019s. Podnar dismissed claimant\u2019s request for a hearing, because he found no basis to award an additional or continuing penalty.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b644-4\">Thereafter, SAIF requested board review of the orders issued by referees Johnson, Harri and Emerson and argued that Johnson did not have jurisdiction, because a timely request for hearing had not been made regarding the determination orders that Johnson had set aside. In its review of Johnson\u2019s order, the Board concluded that Johnson had jurisdiction; however, it held for SAIF on the merits and reversed Johnson\u2019s award of compensation.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On the same day, the Board affirmed Harri\u2019s and Emerson\u2019s orders,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> except for the award of penalties. SAIF filed a petition for judicial review of Johnson\u2019s order. Claimant moved to dismiss, and SAIF did not oppose the motion. We entered an order of dismissal in October, 1990.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-5\">In the meantime, SAIF continued to resist paying claimant TTD, so he sought yet another hearing regarding SAIF\u2019s liability for penalties. In March, 1990, Referee Peterson concluded that, under the circumstances, it was not unreasonable for SAIF to refuse to pay TTD and entered an order dismissing the request for hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-6\">SAIF sought judicial review of the Harri/Emerson order, which had adopted Johnson\u2019s order for TTD. Claimant filed a cross-petition for judicial review but, before we rendered a decision, the Board withdrew its order. The Board then issued an order on reconsideration, in which it concluded that Johnson lacked jurisdiction to issue his order, because claimant\u2019s requests for hearing were made more than a year after the determination orders that were the subject of the requests. Therefore, it held that Harri\u2019s order requiring SAIF to pay TTD was void. It also said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b645-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>\u201c[E]ven if the issue were not \u2018jurisdiction\u2019 <em>per se, </em>Johnson lacked statutory authority to act. It is fundamental that an administrative agency does not have substantive authority beyond that delegated by the legislature. <em>Former </em>ORS 656.319(4) provides that a hearing \u2018shall not be held\u2019 if the request for hearing is not timely filed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b645-4\">On that basis, it concluded that SAIF had not unreasonably resisted the payment of compensation and that SAIF could not be held liable for attorney fees or penalties. On the same day, the Board issued its order regarding Podnar\u2019s and Peterson\u2019s orders<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and affirmed the denial of additional attorney fees and penalties on the basis of the conclusion that Johnson\u2019s order was void.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-5\">Claimant seeks judicial review of the Harri/Emerson order on reconsideration and the Podnar/Peterson order. He seeks reinstatement of Harri\u2019s and Emerson\u2019s orders and additional penalties and attorney fees for SAIF\u2019s failure to pay the compensation ordered by Johnson. In the alternative, claimant argues that the Board erred in not ordering SAIF to pay him TTD while Johnson\u2019s and Harri\u2019s orders were pending on review. Claimant also seeks penalties and attorney fees in connection with those claims. SAIF argues that Johnson\u2019s order was void for lack of jurisdiction, because the request for hearing was not timely filed. Therefore, according to SAIF, because the order was a nullity, it could not give rise to a duty to pay the compensation ordered by Johnson or to any subsequent duty to pay TTD.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-6\">Johnson\u2019s order is not void for want of jurisdiction. A judgment is void only when the tribunal rendering it has no jurisdiction of the parties or the subject matter. <em>Dolph v. Barney, </em>5 Or 191, 211 (1874), <em>aff'd </em>97 US 652 (1878). Subject matter jurisdiction depends on whether the tribunal has the authority to make an inquiry. It exists when a statute authorizes the tribunal to do something about the dispute. <em>See Callahan v. Employment Division, </em>97 Or App 234, 238, 776 P2d 21 (1989). Johnson had authority under ORS 656.708<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>and ORS 656.704(3)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> to decide the issue in dispute. Although the request for hearing was subject to denial as untimely under ORS 656.268(6)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>(since amended by </em>Or Laws 1990, ch 2, \u00a7 16; Or Laws 1991, ch 502, \u00a7 1) and ORS 656.319(4) <em>(since amended by </em>Or Laws 1990, ch 2, \u00a7 24),<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and Johnson may have erroneously exercised his authority when he denied SAIF\u2019s motion to dismiss, his erroneous exercise of that authority did not deprive him of subject matter jurisdiction. <em>See Goss v. Wilkins, </em>80 Or App 241, 721 P2d 884, <em>rev den </em>302 Or 35 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b646-4\">The Board\u2019s reliance on <em>Weyerhaeuser Co. v. Roller, </em>85 Or App 500, 737 P2d 625 (1987), as support for the proposition that a referee lacks jurisdiction when there is no timely request for a hearing regarding a determination order, is misplaced. Although, in that case, we affirmed a Board order that held that the referee did not have jurisdiction to review a determination order in those circumstances, we did not decide the issue on the basis of subject matter jurisdiction. We held only that the requirement that the parties seek a hearing within one year of the issuance of a determination order was not tolled pending a petition for review of a Board order that held the claim to be noncompensable.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-5\">The Board\u2019s decision holding Johnson\u2019s order void is erroneous. However, that does not aid claimant\u2019s cause. When the Board reversed the award of TTD and reinstated the determination orders, and we dismissed the appeal, an award of TTD for the period of September 6, 1983, to November 2, 1987, was precluded.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>The Board predicated its denial of TTD, penalties and attorney fees for the periods of time subsequent to Johnson\u2019s order on its determination that the order was void. Because it is not void, the Board must now consider whether claimant was entitled to TTD while review was pending before it. <em>See </em>ORS 656.313(1) <em>(since amended by </em>Or Laws 1990, ch 2, \u00a7 23).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> We remand to the Board to determine the issues of TTD, penalties and attorney fees in the light of our holding that Johnson\u2019s order was not void. As a result, we need not discuss claimant\u2019s other assignments of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-4\">Reversed and remanded for proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b644-7\"> The Board reversed the portions of Johnson\u2019s order that gave rise to the enforcement actions heard by Harri and Emerson.
