In reaching this conclusion we have taken into account that while defendant has a prior conviction for burning property with intent to defraud the insurer, the conviction was in 1943, about 27 years ago, and since that time defendant has no reported criminal record other than driving a car while his license was suspended. Additionally, defendant is 64 years old and is and has been in poor general health.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-15\">This decision is now made despite our announced remarks at the hearing that defendant\u2019s application was to be continued until the June, 1970, hearings of this Court, and is done to make defendant eligible for parole consideration in May, 1970.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-16\">We thank Larry D. Herman, Esq., of the Montana Defender Project for his assistance to the Court and to the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-18\">SENTENCE REVIEW DIVISION</p>\n<p id=\"b585-19\">Philip C.
