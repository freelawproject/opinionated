Orozco, Texas prisoner #831994, appeals the district court\u2019s dismissal of his motion, which he styled as a Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b) motion, challenging the district court\u2019s grant of leave to proceed in forma pauperis (IFP) in his appeal of the dismissal of his 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-23\">In 2006, Orozco filed a pro se civil rights complaint against prison physician Abbas Khoshdel. The district court dismissed the complaint as frivolous and for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted. Orozco filed a notice of appeal concerning the dismissal of his complaint and moved for leave to proceed IFP on appeal. The district court granted Or-ozco\u2019s IFP motion and, pursuant to the Prison Litigation Reform Act of 1996 (PLRA), required Orozco to pay the $455 appellate filing fee in installments. This court dismissed Orozco\u2019s appeal for lack of jurisdiction because Orozco had not timely filed his notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-24\">Orozco subsequently filed a purported Rule 60(b) motion challenging the district <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>court\u2019s grant of IFP. In his motion, Or-ozco requested the return of the $455 appellate filing fee and argued that the district court should have known at the time that he filed his IFP motion that this court lacked jurisdiction over his appeal because his notice of appeal had not been timely filed. The district court denied the motion, and Orozco filed a timely notice of appeal of the district court\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-5\">Orozco\u2019s brief does not adequately address the basis for the district court\u2019s denial of his motion. <em>See Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 224-25 (5th Cir.1993). Thus, Orozco has abandoned any challenge to the district court\u2019s dismissal of his motion. <em>See Brinkmann v. Dallas County Deputy Sheriff Abner, </em>813 F.2d 744, 748 (5th Cir. 1987). In any event, Orozco is not entitled to a refund of the $455 appellate filing fee simply because his appeal was dismissed for failure to timely file a notice of appeal. <em>See Williams v. Roberts, </em>116 F.3d 1126, 1128 (5th Cir.1997); <em>see also Thurman v. Gramley, </em>97 F.3d 185, 187 (7th Cir.1996), <em>overruled on other grounds by Walker v. O'Brien, </em>216 F.3d 626 (7th Cir.2000) (\u201cA solvent litigant [proceeding IFP on appeal] must pay the filing and docketing fees for the privilege of initiating an appeal; dismissal on jurisdictional grounds [for failure to timely file a notice of appeal] does not lead the court to refund the appellant\u2019s money.\u201d). To the extent that Orozco raises arguments related to his previously dismissed appeal, we are without jurisdiction to consider them. <em>See Pryor v. United States Postal Serv., </em>769 F.2d 281, 288 (5th Cir.1985). Accordingly, the district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b670-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
