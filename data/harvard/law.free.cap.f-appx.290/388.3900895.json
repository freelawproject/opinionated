Vitaliano of the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b411-16\">SUMMARY ORDER</p>\n<p id=\"b411-17\">The defendants William G. Brown and Vlad Goldenberg appeal from judgments of conviction and sentences after a jury trial for illegal conduct arising out of their participation in a \u201cboiler room\u201d stock operation on Staten Island. Brown was convicted of one count of securities-fraud conspiracy, five counts of substantive securities fraud, one count of money-laundering conspiracy, and nine counts of money laundering. The district court sentenced him to 180 months\u2019 imprisonment, three years of supervised release, and $14,563,848.30 in restitution. Golden-berg was convicted of one count of securities-fraud conspiracy and five counts of substantive securities fraud. The district court sentenced him to 97 months\u2019 imprisonment, three years of supervised release, and $2,972,840.14 in restitution. Both defendants appeal the verdicts and sentences. We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the facts, procedural history, and specification of issues on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-18\">I. William Brown</p>\n<p id=\"b411-19\">A. References to Guilty Pleas of Co-conspirators</p>\n<p id=\"b411-20\">Brown argues that his trial was rendered prejudicially unfair when the prosecutor made reference in his summation to the guilty pleas of several co-conspirators who testified against Brown at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>trial. In particular, Brown complains of this statement, which came in over defendant\u2019s objection: \u201cDo you think [the cooperating witnesses] would have pleaded guilty to crimes with an aggregate possible ... sentence of ever [sic] a hundred years imprisonment if these were really good deals and there was no stock fraud? Of course not.\u201d Despite overruling Brown\u2019s objection to the prosecutor\u2019s statement, the district court instructed the jury \u201cto draw no inferences of any kind about the guilt of the defendants on trial from the fact that the prosecution witnesses pled guilty to similar or related charges.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b412-4\">A defendant demanding a new trial based on remarks by a prosecutor at trial must demonstrate that \u201cthe misconduct alleged [is] so severe and significant as to result in the denial of [his] right to a fair trial.\u201d <em>United States v. Locascio, </em>6 F.3d 924, 945 (2d Cir.1993). \u201cIt is a rare case in which improper comments in a prosecutor\u2019s summation are so prejudicial that a new trial is required.\u201d <em>United States v. Rodriguez, </em>968 F.2d 130, 142 (2d Cir.1992) (internal quotation marks omitted). This is not such a case. \u201cDetermination of whether there should be a reversal requires an evaluation of the severity of the misconduct, the curative measures taken, and the certainty of conviction absent the misconduct.\u201d <em>United States v. Rosa, </em>17 F.3d 1531, 1549 (2d Cir.1994). Although the prosecutor\u2019s statement was improper, <em>United States v. Louis, </em>814 F.2d 852, 856 (2d Cir.1987), it was isolated, and the evidence against Brown was extremely strong. Moreover, the district court gave a clear and correct curative instruction. <em>Cf. United States v. Ramirez, </em>973 F.2d 102, 105 (2d Cir.1992). When a district court gives such an instruction, we reverse only \u201cwhere there is an overwhelming probability that the jury will be unable to follow the court\u2019s instructions and the evidence is devastating to the defense.\u201d <em>United States v. Jones, </em>16 F.3d 487, 493 (2d Cir.1994). Again, this is not such a case. <em>See United States v. Cruz, </em>797 F.2d 90, 93 n. 1 (2d Cir.1986) (affirming conviction when district court issued a curative instruction \u201cdirected specifically toward\u201d a misstatement made in the prosecutor\u2019s summation).</p>\n<p id=\"b412-6\">B. Reasonableness of the Sentence</p>\n<p id=\"b412-7\">Brown argues that the sentence of 180 months\u2019 imprisonment imposed by the district court is substantively unreasonable, despite that it was a 55-month downward variance from the low end of the correctly calculated Guidelines range. The Supreme Court recently confirmed that the courts of appeals review all sentences for abuse of discretion, \u201cwhether inside or outside the Guidelines range.\u201d <em>Gall v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, -, -, 128 S.Ct. 586, 594, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). Because Brown alleges no procedural error, we need only \u201cconsider the substantive reasonableness of the sentence ... tak[ing] into account the totality of the circumstances, including the extent of any variance from the Guidelines range.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 597. While the \u201clength of a sentence can exceed the bounds of \u2018reasonableness,\u2019 we anticipate encountering such circumstances infrequently.\u201d <em>United States v. Fleming, </em>397 F.3d 95, 100 (2d Cir.2005). When the sentence is <em>within </em>the Guidelines, the defendant bears a significant burden because the Sentencing Commission and the sentencing judge have agreed that the challenged sentence achieves the purposes of \u00a7 3553(a). <em>See Rita v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, ---, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2465-67, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007). In this case, the district court\u2019s downward variance by almost six years suggests strongly that the sentence is not unreasonably long.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-12\">Brown also contends that his sentence must be reversed because Gary Todd, a co-conspirator whom Brown deems equally culpable, received only an 87-month sen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>tence. We do not object to a \u201cdistrict court[\u2019s] consideration of similarities and differences among codefendants when imposing a sentence,\u201d but \u201c\u00a7 8553(a) does not require district courts to consider sentencing disparity among co-defendants.\u201d <em>United States v. Wills, </em>476 F.3d 103, 110 (2d Cir.2007) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). Moreover, Brown and Todd were not similarly situated: (1) Todd pleaded guilty, entitling him to credit under the Guidelines for acceptance of responsibility; (2) Todd pleaded guilty only to one aspect of the scheme, while Brown was found guilty at trial of two conspiracy counts, five securities-fraud counts, and nine money-laundering counts; and (3) at the trial, evidence was admitted demonstrating Brown\u2019s obstruction of justice related to the SEC investigation, exposing him to greater penalties. As such, the district court\u2019s sentence was not substantively unreasonable, even when compared to Todd\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-5\">II. Vlad Goldenberg</p>\n<p id=\"b413-6\">A. Ineffective Assistance of Counsel</p>\n<p id=\"b413-7\">Goldenberg argues that he received ineffective assistance of counsel when his attorney made arguments in summation which opened the door to the government introducing incriminating statements Goldenberg had made at a proffer session prior to trial. Whatever the merits of Golden-berg\u2019s claim, we see no reason to deviate from our \u201cbaseline aversion to resolving ineffectiveness claims on direct review.\u201d <em>United States v. Khedr, </em>343 F.3d 96, 99-100 (2d Cir.2003) (citations and internal question marks omitted); <em>see also Massaro v. United States, </em>538 U.S. 500, 504-05, 123 S.Ct. 1690, 155 L.Ed.2d 714 (2003). Although we will review claims on direct appeal when the record is fully developed and resolution is beyond doubt, <em>United States v. Garcia, </em>413 F.3d 201, 219 n. 13 (2d Cir.2005), these requirements are not met here, and we decline to review Golden-berg\u2019s ineffectiveness claim at this point.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-9\">B. Consciousness-of-Guilt Instruction</p>\n<p id=\"b413-10\">Goldenberg argues that the district court erred by instructing the jury that it could infer his consciousness of guilt from the testimony of his co-conspirator Mario Rodriguez, that Goldenberg coached him to lie in testimony before the SEC and NASD. There was nothing improper about this instruction; we have held that \u201ca defendant\u2019s knowledge of the conspiracy and his participation in it with criminal intent may be established through circumstantial evidence,\u201d and \u201c[sjuch circumstantial evidence may include acts that exhibit a consciousness of guilt, such as ... attempts to influence the testimony of a witness.\u201d <em>United States v. Gordon, </em>987 F.2d 902, 906-07 (2d Cir.1993) (internal citations omitted). Here the evidence was clear that Goldenberg was impersonating Rodriguez when dealing with his clients because Rodriguez was a licensed broker and Goldenberg was not. When Rodriguez was called to testify before the SEC and NASD, Goldenberg gave Rodriguez significant information about his clients so that Rodriguez could mislead investigators into believing they were his clients and not Goldenberg\u2019s. As such, evidence in the record supported giving the instruction. Moreover, the district court committed no error in stating in its instruction that there was evidence that Goldenberg had \u201ccoached\u201d Rodriguez, as the record supported that characterization. <em>See United States v. Lung Fong Chen, </em>393 F.3d 139, 153 (2d Cir.2004) (\u201cthe district court has broad discretion to decide which facts, if any, it will mention in its comments to the jury\u201d (internal citations omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b413-11\">C. Obstruction-of-Justice Enhancement</p>\n<p id=\"b413-12\">Goldenberg argues that the district court erred by assessing a two-level en<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>hancement to his sentence for obstruction of justice under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1, based on his coaching Rodriguez prior to his SEC testimony. \u201cWe review <em>de novo </em>the sentencing court\u2019s interpretation of the Sentencing Guidelines but review its related findings of fact only for clear error.\u201d <em>United States v. Fiore, </em>381 F.3d 89, 92 (2d Cir.2004). An enhancement under \u00a7 3C1.1 is appropriate only if the district court makes a finding that the defendant had the specific intent to obstruct justice, and that finding may be made by a preponderance of the evidence. <em>United States v. Carty, </em>264 F.3d 191, 194 (2d Cir.2001) (per cu-riam). Here, the district court made such a finding, and it was supported by the record. Given the evidence noted above, it was certainly not clearly erroneous for the district court to find that Goldenberg intended to obstruct justice when coaching Rodriguez to lie before the SEC and NASD.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-4\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgments of the district court are hereby AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
