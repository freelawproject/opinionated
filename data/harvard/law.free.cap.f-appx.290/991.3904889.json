INS, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"992\">*992</page-number>222 F.3d 1208, 1209 (9th Cir.2000) (per curiam) (notice to attorney of record constitutes notice to the petitioner).</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-4\">The 1994 charging document was not facially deficient because it gave Singh sufficient notice of the grounds of his inadmissibility. <em>See Lazaro v. Mukasey, </em>527 F.3d 977, 980 (9th Cir.2008). At oral argument, Singh abandoned his ineffective assistance of counsel claim, conceding that he had not established such a claim.

The Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 (\"IIRIRA\u201d) has replaced Section 1105 a with a new judicial review provision codified at 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. However, the new provision does not apply to petitions such as Singh\u2019s, whose deportation proceedings commenced before April 1, 1997. <em>See </em>IIRIRA \u00a7 309(c)(1); <em>see also Valeriano v.
