We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts, the procedural history, and the issues on appeal. We review the Tax Court\u2019s findings of fact for clear error, <em>see Am. Valmar Int\u2019l Ltd. v. Comm\u2019r, </em>229 F.3d 98, 101 (2d Cir.2000), and its legal determinations <em>de novo, see Texasgulf, Inc. v. Comm\u2019r, </em>172 F.3d 209, 214 (2d Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b415-13\">[1] We agree with the Tax Court\u2019s conclusion that the patent royalty payments do not qualify for long-term capital gains treatment under 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 1235 because, to the extent Garfield transferred patent rights to Mechanical Plastics Corp. (\u201cMPC\u201d), he transferred those rights to a related person. <em>See </em>26 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 267(b)(2), 1235(d). Garfield asserts that he transferred his patent rights to an unrelated entity by operation of a \u201cforbearance agreement\u201d executed in 1969. There is no evidence of a forbearance agreement in the record aside from Garfield\u2019s testimony that it existed, which the Tax Court rejected as not credible. Having reviewed the record, we conclude that the Tax Court\u2019s finding was not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-14\">The Tax Court rejected Garfield\u2019s alternative argument that the royalties were long-term capital gains under 26 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1221-1222. The court found that Garfield failed to hold any patent right for the requisite period before transferring it. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 1222. Our review of the record reveals no clear error in the Tax Court\u2019s finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-15\">Garfield argues that the Commissioner is estopped from challenging his tax treatment of patent royalties because the Commissioner approved that treatment during a 1983 audit. Even assuming (as we do not) that the Commissioner may be estopped from challenging tax treatment after previously indicating his approval, Garfield fails to show that the Commissioner approved <em>his </em>treatment of royalty income as long-term capital gain. Rather, the record shows that MPC \u2014 not Garfield \u2014 obtained a \u201cno change\u201d letter following an audit of MPC\u2019s 1981 corporate return.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-16\">[2] Garfield unsuccessfully argued to the Tax Court that he was entitled to protection from an accuracy-related penal<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>ty, <em>see </em>26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6662, because he acted in good faith and with reasonable cause when underpaying his taxes, <em>see id. </em>\u00a7 6664(c)(1). In sustaining the penalty, the Tax Court noted that Garfield did \u201cnot contend that [he] followed, or even sought, the advice of a tax professional.\u201d Garfield acknowledged at oral argument that he never contended to the Tax Court that he sought or followed professional tax advice. While his Forms 1040 for the years 2000-2002 were signed by Cohen, Estis and Associates, L.L.P., Garfield conceded at oral argument that nothing in the record indicates that Cohen, Estis and Associates, L.L.P. is a tax professional; nor does the record reflect that Garfield provided Cohen, Estis and Associates with complete and accurate information. <em>See Crigler v. Comm\u2019r, 85 </em>T.C.M. (CCH) 1091 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b416-4\">We have considered Garfield\u2019s remaining arguments and find them to be without merit. For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the Tax Court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
