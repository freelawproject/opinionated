Brown appeals his sentence of 24 months\u2019 imprisonment, imposed after the district court revoked his supervised release, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e)(3). After review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-9\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b331-10\">In 1998, Brown was convicted of possession with intent to distribute crack cocaine and served a 110-month prison sentence. The terms of his supervised release mandated that Brown \u201cnot commit any federal, state or local crimes\u201d and imposed a special condition that he maintain \u201cfull-time, legitimate employment\u201d and not be unemployed for more than thirty days without permission.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-11\">Following his release on January 27, 2007, Brown\u2019s probation officer petitioned for revocation of his supervised release, alleging, <em>inter alia, </em>that Brown had failed to maintain full-time employment and remained unemployed for more than thirty days. A superseding petition alleged that Brown also violated Florida law by possessing and selling cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-12\">At an evidentiary hearing, the government presented testimony of Detective Michael Dilks with the Sheriffs Office in Indian River County. Dilks testified that, during a narcotics investigation, a confidential informant (\u201cCl\u201d) arranged a controlled buy with a drug dealer named \u201cMook.\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Dilks showed the Cl a photograph of defendant Brown, and the Cl identified him as \u201cMook.\u201d Dilks surreptitiously watched as a blue four-door car driven by a black male arrived and the Cl walked to the vehicle and conducted a hand-to-hand exchange. The Cl returned to Dilks with crack cocaine.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The government also presented testimony from Brown\u2019s probation officer that Brown had been unemployed for the majority of his supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-18\">The magistrate judge issued a report (\u201cR&amp;R\u201d) recommending that Brown\u2019s supervised release be revoked because the government had shown by a preponderance of the evidence that Brown was unemployed for over thirty days and had sold cocaine. The R&amp;R concluded that Dilks\u2019s hearsay testimony about the Cl\u2019s identification of Brown as the \u201cMook\u201d who sold him the cocaine was reliable, noting that there was independent corroboration. The R&amp;R identified the following evidence establishing Brown as \u201cMook\u201d: (1) the Cl identified his drug source as \u201cMook,\u201d (2) Dilks testified that Brown was known in the area as \u201cMook,\u201d (3) Brown\u2019s PSI referenced \u201cMook\u201d as Brown\u2019s street name, (4) the Cl identified Brown from a photograph, and (5) Dilks personally witnessed the phone call and the controlled buy. The R&amp;R also noted that video surveillance showed a blue car, and Brown was known to drive a blue four-door car. The R&amp;R noted the Cl\u2019s criminal history, but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>concluded that these past convictions did not outweigh the reliability of the CPs identification. The R&amp;R also found that the government had shown that Brown failed to maintain employment and was unemployed for at least thirty days.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-4\">Brown filed an objection to the R&amp;R, arguing that Dilks\u2019s hearsay testimony that the Cl had identified the drug dealer \u201cMook\u201d as defendant Brown was unreliable. Over Brown\u2019s objection, the district court adopted the R&amp;R and found that Brown had violated his supervised release terms. The district court sentenced Brown to 24 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-5\">Brown timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-6\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b332-7\">A district court may \u201crevoke a term of supervised release, and require the defendant to serve in prison all or part of the term of supervised release authorized by statute ... if the court ... finds by a preponderance of the evidence that the defendant violated a condition of [his] supervised release.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3588(e)(8).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Although the Federal Rules of Evidence do not apply in revocation of supervised release proceedings, defendants \u201care entitled to certain minimal due process requirements,\u201d and \u201cthe admissibility of hearsay is not automatic.\u201d <em>Frazier, </em>26 F.3d at 114. In deciding whether to admit hearsay testimony, the district court must (1) conduct a balancing test between \u201cthe defendant\u2019s right to confront adverse witnesses\u201d and \u201cthe grounds asserted by the government for denying confrontation,\u201d and (2) determine whether the hearsay statement is reliable. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b332-11\">On appeal, Brown argues that Dilks\u2019s hearsay testimony as to the Cl\u2019s identification of Brown was unreliable.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Brown emphasizes the Cl\u2019s prior criminal history and the fact that Dilks\u2019s testimony changed regarding whether he showed the Cl Brown\u2019s driver\u2019s license photograph or some other photograph.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-12\">However, the Cl\u2019s identification of Brown was supported by independent corroborating evidence. Dilks witnessed the Cl place a phone call to a drug dealer named \u201cMook\u201d and arrange a drug deal and then witnessed the Cl conduct a hand-to-hand exchange for crack cocaine with a black male driving a blue, four-door car. Brown\u2019s PSI established that Brown had used the alias \u201cMook.\u201d Brown\u2019s probation officer testified that Brown sometimes drove a blue, four-door car matching the description of the car Dilks saw during the controlled buy.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-13\">Given this corroborating evidence, the district court did not abuse its discretion in concluding that Dilks\u2019s hearsay testimony identifying Brown was reliable and finding that Brown violated his supervised release by selling crack cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-14\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b331-13\">. Dilks named and identified the Cl, but we do not refer to him by name.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b331-15\">. Dilks also testified that a surveillance team followed the blue car, conducted a traffic stop and positively identified Brown as the driver. However, the magistrate judge found this portion of Dilks's testimony too vague and uncorroborated to be reliable and did not rely on it.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b332-8\">. We review a district court's revocation of supervised release for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Frazier, </em>26 F.3d 110, 112 (11th Cir.1994). The district court\u2019s findings of fact made at a revocation hearing are reviewed for clear error. <em>United States v. Almand, </em>992 F.2d 316, 318 (11th Cir.1993).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b332-9\">. We decline to address Brown\u2019s alternative arguments, raised on appeal for the first time in his reply brief and never raised in the district court, that the district court (1) erred by failing to inquire as to why the Cl was unable to testify, and (2) violated his Sixth Amendment confrontation rights under <em>Crawford v. Washington, </em>541 U.S. 36, 124 S.Ct. 1354, 158 L.Ed.2d 177 (2004), by admitting the Cl\u2019s out-of-court identification. <em>See United States v. Britt, </em>437 F.3d 1103, 1104 (11th Cir.2006) (declining to address issues not raised in the initial brief).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
