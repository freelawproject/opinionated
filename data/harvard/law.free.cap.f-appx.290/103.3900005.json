HARTZ, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b126-17\">Isaac Clinton Allen, appearing pro se, requests a certificate of appealability (COA) to appeal the district court\u2019s denial of his motion for relief under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 2253(c)(1)(B) (requiring COA to appeal denial of \u00a7 2255 motion). He claims that (1) he was deprived of his Sixth Amendment right to effective assistance of counsel because counsel (a) failed to consult a firearms expert to prove that the AK-47 rifle in his possession had not been altered, (b) lied to him by saying that such an expert had been retained, and (c) failed to honor his request to appeal when he learned the truth; and (2) the district court erred in refusing to hold an eviden-tiary hearing. Because no reasonable jurist could conclude that Mr. Allen\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion should have been resolved in a different manner, <em>see Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 485, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000), we deny his application for a COA and dismiss this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-18\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b126-19\">On October 13, 2006, Mr. Allen pleaded guilty in the United States District Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>for the Northern District of Oklahoma to a charge of felon in possession of firearms and ammunition. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1). The court sentenced him to 76 months\u2019 imprisonment and ordered him to pay a fine of $8,000.00 and a special monetary assessment of $100.00. Following his conviction Mr. Allen did not file a direct appeal but filed a motion for relief under \u00a7 2255. He alleged that he had received ineffective assistance of counsel because his counsel did not object to the district court\u2019s base-offense level calculation under the United States Sentencing Guidelines (USSG). He contended that his base-offense level should not have been calculated under USSG \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(3) (providing for a base offense level of 22 for an offense involving a rifle whose barrel is shorter than 16 inches) and that counsel failed to consult a firearms expert regarding the measurement of the AK-47 rifle that had been in his possession. He also requested an evidentiary hearing to resolve his claims. (The \u00a7 2255 motion did not allege that counsel was ineffective for failing to appeal, so we need not address that issue. <em>See United States v. Dixon, </em>1 F.3d 1080, 1082 n. 2 (10th Cir.1993) (declining to address issue not raised in original \u00a7 2255 motion), <em>abrogated on other grounds by Florida v. White, </em>526 U.S. 559, 119 S.Ct. 1555, 143 L.Ed.2d 748 (1999).) The district court denied Mr. Allen\u2019s motion and his request for an evidentiary hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-5\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b127-6\">A. Ineffective-Assistance-of-Counsel Claim</p>\n<p id=\"b127-7\">A person seeking a COA must make \u201ca substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2). \u201cWhere a district court has rejected the constitutional claims on the merits, ... [t]he [movant] must demonstrate that reasonable jurists would find the district court\u2019s assessment of the constitutional claims debatable or wrong.\u201d <em>Slack, </em>529 U.S. at 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-9\">To obtain relief on his ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim, Mr. Anderson must show both that his \u201ccounsel\u2019s representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness\u201d and \u201cthat there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\u201d <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 688, 694, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). The review of trial counsel\u2019s performance \u201cmust be highly deferential\u201d and the court \u201cmust indulge a strong presumption that counsel\u2019s conduct falls within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance; that is, the defendant must overcome the presumption that, under the circumstances, the challenged action might be considered sound trial strategy.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 689, 104 S.Ct. 2052 (internal quotation marks omitted). Applying these demanding standards, the district court correctly determined that Mr. Allen had failed to show that his counsel\u2019s performance fell below an objective standard of reasonableness.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b127-12\">Mr. Allen states his claims as follows: Trial counsel in the instant case failed to exercise proper sound counsel when using AFT [sic] Agent Petree to perform the measurement of the rifle barrel for the defense. [He] was prejudiced because (l)[he] was not informed that his counsel had used the government\u2019s witness as a expert for the defense of which the agent was plurally operating in the interest of the government to establish the weapon [he] was convicted was modified, and (2) counsel performed deficiently when using Agent Petree to determine the outcome of the sentencing proceedings and lying to [him] in which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>counsel had claimed the \u201cmeasuring of the rifle barrel was performed by Mark Lyons.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b128-6\">Aplt\u2019s Br. in Supp. of Req. for COA at 6-7. The undisputed facts in the affidavits presented by the government, however, show that there was no deficiency in defense counsel\u2019s work. Special Agent Josh Pe-tree of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms &amp; Explosives swore that on two occasions \u2014 once in the presence of the prosecutor and defense counsel \u2014 he measured the barrel of the rifle possessed by Mr. Allen and found the barrel to be 12 inches in length. Defense counsel, Stephen J. Knorr, swore that (1) he had observed Agent Petree measure the rifle; (2) the measurement was \u201cless than 16 inches by two or three inches,\u201d R. Vol. I, Doc. 58, Ex. 2 at 1; and (3) he had described Agent Petree\u2019s measurement to Mark Lyons, a local criminal defense attorney and licensed firearms dealer, who had told him that Agent Petree\u2019s method of measuring \u201cwould ensure the longest measurement and was the proper way to determine the actual length of a barrel,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 2. Based on this information, defense counsel concluded that \u201cthere were no grounds to challenge the two level increase based on the barrel length\u201d and therefore did not object to the court\u2019s base-offense-level calculation at sentencing. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b128-7\">To establish that counsel\u2019s performance was deficient, Mr. Allen submitted an article from Wikipedia on \u201cAK-47,\u201d which says that an unaltered barrel of an AK-47 rifle is 16.3 inches in length. Mr. Allen\u2019s \u201cevidence,\u201d however, shows only that his rifle must have been altered. It does not contradict the evidence regarding the length of the barrel of his weapon.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-8\">B. Denial of Evidentiary Hearing</p>\n<p id=\"b128-9\">\u201cWe review the district court\u2019s refusal to hold an evidentiary hearing for an abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>United States v. Harms, </em>371 F.3d 1208, 1210 (10th Cir. 2004). Mr. Allen contends that the district court erred when it refused to hold an evidentiary hearing to resolve his ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim. But \u201c[t]he purpose of an evidentiary hearing is to resolve conflicting evidence\u201d and a hearing is unnecessary when the uncontested evidence establishes that counsel\u2019s performance was not ineffective. <em>Anderson v. Att\u2019y Gen. of Kan., </em>425 F.3d 853, 860 (10th Cir.2005); <em>see Blackledge v. Allison, </em>431 U.S. 63, 80-83, 97 S.Ct. 1621, 52 L.Ed.2d 136 (1977) (petitioner not entitled to full evidentiary hearing when he fails to raise a genuine issue of fact to be resolved by the court). Because the undisputed facts in the record demonstrate that counsel\u2019s performance was not ineffective, the district court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to hold an evidentiary hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-11\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b128-12\">No reasonable jurist could debate the district court\u2019s rulings. Therefore, we DENY Mr. Allen\u2019s application for a COA and DISMISS this appeal.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
