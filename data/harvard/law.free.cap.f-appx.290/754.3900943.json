He filed a \u201cMotion to Modify/or Clarify Sentence Pursuant to Fed. Rule of Criminal Procedure 35(a)(2) and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(b)(C)(i).\u201d The district court dismissed the motion on October 5, 2006. On November 30, 2007, Cour-ville filed a \u201cMotion for Determination of Status and Order for the Government to Show Cause\u201d to determine the status of his \u201cMotion to Modify/or Clarify Sentence.\u201d The court denied the November 30 motion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"756\">*756</page-number>on December 3, 2007, and Courville filed a notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-4\">Courville asserts that he is seeking review of the denial of his \u201cMotion to Modify/or Clarify Sentence.\u201d We pretermit the issue of whether he has filed a timely notice of appeal with respect to that motion, because there is no jurisdictional impediment to reaching the merits of the case, and his appeal fails on the merits. <em>See United States v. Martinez, </em>496 F.3d 387, 389 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 728, 169 L.Ed.2d 568 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b778-7\">The district court\u2019s jurisdiction to correct or modify a sentence is limited to those specific circumstances articulated in \u00a7 3582(b) and (c). <em>United States v. Bridges, </em>116 F.3d 1110, 1112 (5th Cir. 1997). Courville\u2019s contention that he is entitled to relief because <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), altered the binding nature of the guidelines provides no basis for a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion. <em>See United States v. Shaw, </em>30 F.3d 26, 28-29 (5th Cir.1994). Furthermore, Fed.R.Crim.P. 35 does not provide a basis for relief, because neither the version of rule 35 in force when Courville committed his offenses nor the current version permits the district court to correct a sentence \u201cat any time\u201d or on the defendant\u2019s motion. <em>See </em>Fed. R.CrimP. 35.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-8\">Courville\u2019s notice of appeal was timely with respect to the denial of his \u201cMotion for Determination of Status.\u201d <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(1). Federal courts are courts of limited jurisdiction. <em>Save the Bay, Inc. v. United States Army, </em>639 F.2d 1100, 1102 (5th Cir.1981) (per curiam). The order denying the \u201cMotion for Determination of Status\u201d was not a final order of dismissal. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291; <em>Frizzell v. Sullivan, </em>937 F.2d 254, 255 (5th Cir. 1991). The order also does not fall within any jurisprudential exception that would render it a final, appealable order. <em>See Witherspoon v. White, </em>111 F.3d 399, 401 n. 5 (5th Cir.1997) (recognizing the collateral order, death knell, and pragmatic finality exceptions to the general rule requiring finality). It also does not fall into the classes of interlocutory decisions listed in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292 over which courts of appeal have jurisdiction. Finally, it was not certified for appeal by the district court pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(b) or Fed.R.Civ.P. 54(b). Thus, this court does not have jurisdiction over the order. <em>See Dardar v. Lafourche Realty Co., </em>849 F.2d 955, 957 (5th Cir.1988); <em>Save the Bay, </em>639 F.2d at 1102.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b777-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
