INA \u00a7 241(b)(3), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(c). The Board concluded that Estrada-Pena failed to establish past persecution, a probability of future persecution, or a likelihood of torture if she returns to El Salvador. We deny Estrada-Pena\u2019s petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-16\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b283-17\">After four unsuccessful attempts, Estrada-Pena entered the United States on April 7, 2004. Two weeks later, Estrada-Pena was charged for being present in the country without admission or parole. INA \u00a7 212(a)(6)(A)\u00ae, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(6)(A)\u00ae. At her removal hearing, Estrada-Pena admitted the charges and conceded removability. The immigration judge continued the hearing when Estrada-Pena stated that she planned to file an application for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the Convention. In her application for asylum and withholding of removal, Estrada-Pena alleged persecution based on her political opinion. She alleged that, after the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front gained control of the government of El Salvador <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>in the 2003 election, the Farabundo Marti threatened to harm her to retaliate for her father\u2019s involvement with the opposition Arena Party.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-4\">Estrada-Pena testified that, while she lived with her aunt, the Farabundo Marti left notes at night under the door of her family\u2019s home. The notes threatened to \u201cget even\u201d with Estrada-Pena\u2019s father for his support of the Arena Party. Estrada-Pena did not participate in any political activity, but Farabundo Marti threatened to harm her because she was her father\u2019s \u201cmost beloved daughter.\u201d Estrada-Pena\u2019s family was never harmed and moved to a different town to escape the threats. Estrada-Pena remained with her aunt after the threats, but alleged that she was forced to leave because the Farabundo Marti investigated her absence from the family home. On one occasion, Estrada-Pena was shadowed while she was on a bus, but she was not confronted or harmed. Estrada-Pena testified that she feared that she would be raped or murdered if she returned to El Salvador.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-5\">The immigration judge denied Estrada-Pena\u2019s application. The judge found that Estrada-Pena had never participated in political activities, was never harmed, and her family remained in El Salvador. The judge found that there was no evidence that the Farabundo Marti targeted Estrada-Pena on the basis of her actual or an imputed political opinion. Absent evidence of persecution or a reasonable basis to fear future harm, the judge denied asylum and concluded that Estrada-Pena was ineligible for withholding of removal and relief under the Convention.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-6\">The Board of Immigration Appeals affirmed. The Board ruled that the threats against Estrada-Pena did not establish that she was subject to past persecution or that she possessed a well-founded fear of future persecution when her family had remained unharmed in El Salvador. The Board also decided that Estrada-Pena failed to establish that she would, more likely than not, be tortured when she returned to El Salvador.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-8\">II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b284-9\">We review the decision of the Board to determine whether it is \u201c \u2018supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u2019 \u201d <em>Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1284 (11th Cir.2001) (quoting <em>Lor-isme v. INS, </em>129 F.3d 1441, 1444-45 (11th Cir.1997)). \u201cTo reverse [those] fact findings, we must find that the record not only supports reversal, but compels it.\u201d <em>Mendoza v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>327 F.3d 1283, 1287 (11th Cir.2003)(citing <em>Fahim v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>278 F.3d 1216, 1218 (11th Cir. 2002)).</p>\n<p id=\"b284-10\">III. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b284-11\">Estrada-Pena argues that she established past persecution and a well-founded fear of future persecution. She argues that she was targeted based on a political opinion that the Farabundo Marti imputed to her because of her father\u2019s involvement with the Arena Party. Estrada-Pena\u2019s argument fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-12\">To qualify for withholding of removal, an alien must prove that her \u201clife or freedom would be threatened on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\u201d <em>Mendoza, </em>327 F.3d at 1287 (citing 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3)(A)). The alien must establish that she \u201cmore-likely-than-not would be persecuted ... upon [her] return to the country in question.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Fahim, </em>278 F.3d at 1218). An applicant for relief under the Convention must \u201cestablish that it is more likely than not that ... she would be tortured if removed to the pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>posed country of removal.\u201d <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1303 (quoting 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(c)(2)) (internal quotation marks omitted). Torture is confined to those acts inflicting \u201csevere pain and suffering, whether physical or mental\u201d committed at the hands, under the direction, or with the acquiescence of \u201ca public official or other person acting in an official capacity.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.18(a)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b285-5\">Substantial evidence supports the decision that Estrada-Pena did not suffer political persecution. Estrada-Pena\u2019s testimony about receiving written threats and perceiving once that she had been followed on a bus supports the finding that Estrada-Pena suffered harassment, not persecution. <em>See Silva v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>448 F.3d 1229, 1238 (11th Cir.2006); <em>Sepulveda v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1226, 1231 (11th Cir.2005). Estrada-Pena also was not targeted on account of a protected ground because her testimony established, at most, that she was threatened because of her relationship to her father, not on account of her actual or imputed political opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-6\">The record also supports the finding that Estrada-Pena does not have a well-founded fear of future persecution. Estrada-Pena testified that her father had left the Arena Party and she was not involved in any political activity or organization adverse to the Farabundo Marti. <em>See Silva, </em>448 F.3d at 1237-38. She also testified that her family had relocated within El Salvador and remained unharmed. <em>See Ruiz v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>440 F.3d 1247, 1259 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b285-7\">Substantial evidence also supports the finding that Estrada-Pena will not likely be tortured upon her return to El Salvador. \u201cThe burden of proof for an applicant seeking withholding of removal under the Convention, like that for an applicant seeking withholding of removal under the statute, is higher than the burden imposed on an asylum applicant.\u201d <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1303; <em>see </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(c)(2). Because Estrada-Pena failed to establish a well-founded fear of persecution, she also cannot establish that she would suffer \u201ctorture.\u201d <em>See Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1303-04.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-9\">IY. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b285-10\">Estrada-Pena\u2019s petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
