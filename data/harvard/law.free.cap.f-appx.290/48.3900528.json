We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>Huffine contends that the district court abused its discretion by denying his motion for the appointment of standby counsel to assist him in his self-representation. However, Huffine\u2019s unconditional guilty plea waived his right to appeal the denial of standby counsel. <em>See United States v. Lopez-Armenta, </em>400 F.3d 1173, 1175 (9th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b71-5\">Huffine also contends that the district court abused its discretion by denying his motion to withdraw his guilty plea before sentencing. However, Huffine failed to meet his burden of demonstrating a fair and just reason for withdrawing his plea before sentencing. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Crim.P. 11(d)(2)(B). The district judge who accepted Huffine\u2019s guilty plea determined that Huffine had adequately discussed the plea with his counsel and understood the consequences. The thorough Rule 11 colloquy belies Huffine\u2019s contention that the plea was given under duress. Further, Huffine\u2019s belief, based upon his own reading of the statute, that he is actually innocent of the offense does not constitute \u201cnewly discovered evidence\u201d supporting withdrawal of the guilty plea. <em>See United States v. Jones, </em>472 F.3d 1136, 1141 (9th Cir.2007). We conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b71-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b70-29\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
