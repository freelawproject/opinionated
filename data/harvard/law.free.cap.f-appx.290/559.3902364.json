Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-24\">Hearne first maintains that the rule of this circuit which affords a rebuttable presumption of reasonableness to a sentence within a correctly calculated guideline range effectively reinstates the mandatory guideline scheme and is thus contrary to <em>Booker </em>and unreasonable. This is an untenable position after <em>Rita v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 2456, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>2462-69, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007), which upheld our presumption of reasonableness for a within-guidelines sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-5\">Hearne\u2019s two counts of conviction were grouped together for sentencing purposes under <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 3Dl.l(c) (2005). Hearne did not previously challenge the grouping of the two counts, but now claims that Count Three was the most serious offense because it had a higher statutory maximum than Count One, and thus should have been used as the offense level for the group. He relies on <em>United States v. Brinton, </em>139 F.3d 718, 722 (9th Cir.1998), <em>overruled on other grounds by United States v. Nordby, </em>225 F.3d 1053 (9th Cir. 2000), <em>overruled on other grounds </em>by <em>United States v. Buckland, </em>289 F.3d 558 (9th Cir.2002). However, to the extent that <em>Brinton </em>constitutes a ruling on the issue, and not mere dicta, its reasoning has been rejected by three circuits. <em>See United States v. Eversole, </em>487 F.3d 1024, 1032-34 (6th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 649, 169 L.Ed.2d 516 (2007); <em>United States v. Evans, </em>318 F.3d 1011, 1020 (10th Cir.2003); <em>United States v. Kroeger, </em>229 F.3d 700, 703 (8th Cir.2000). Moreover, because Hearne failed to raise this issue in his prior appeal, he has forfeited review of the issue under the mandate rule. <em>United States v. Bell, </em>5 F.3d 64, 66 (4th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b583-8\">Hearne filed a pro se motion for a downward departure before he was sentenced. Although the district court assured Hearne before imposing sentence that it had read everything he filed, Hearne maintains that the court did not consider the reasons for a downward departure he set out in his motion, as evidenced by the court\u2019s failure to discuss most of the arguments he made in favor of a departure. This court lacks the authority to review the district court\u2019s decision to deny Hearne the departure he requested. <em>United States v. Brewer, </em>520 F.3d 367, 371-72 (4th Cir.2008). However, a failure to consider the 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3553(a) (West 2000 &amp; Supp.2008) factors would constitute a procedural error. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). Nevertheless, \u201cwhere judge and Commission both determine that\u201d a guideline sentence is appropriate, \u201cthat sentence likely reflects the \u00a7 3553(a) factors.\u201d <em>Rita, </em>127 S.Ct. at 2467.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-12\">Here, the district court decided that a sentence within the guideline range of 140-175 months was not excessive in light of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and Hearne\u2019s \u201crecord of continuous assaults, [and] the likelihood of continued criminal activity....\u201d The court also stated that \u00a7 3553 required a sentence \u201cat least equal to that which is set forth in the Sentencing Guidelines,\u201d because of the likelihood that Hearne would commit future crimes, the necessity of protecting the public, and the principle of deterrence. We are satisfied that no error occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-13\">In his first appeal, Hearne contested the district court\u2019s factual finding that, in addition to the Ruger revolver charged in the indictment, he had possessed two additional firearms. This court upheld the district court\u2019s determination that government witness David Horne was credible when he testified at sentencing that Hearne threatened him with two guns with an ammunition clip, which he described first as a Mac 9 and a Mac 10, and later as \u201cUzi-like.\u201d At the resentencing, after Hearne\u2019s testimony, the district court again found that the base offense level was appropriately enhanced.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-14\">Hearne argues that the district court\u2019s finding was erroneous because it was based on unreliable information. <em>See </em>USSG \u00a7 6A1.3(a), p.s. However, the district court\u2019s credibility findings are not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>renewable on appeal. <em>See United States v. Locklear, </em>829 F.2d 1314, 1317 (4th Cir. 1987). We conclude that the district court did not clearly err in reaching the same conclusion it did at the first sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-4\">Last, Hearne argues that the district court erred in denying his motion to withdraw his guilty plea. Hearne did not contest the validity of his guilty plea in his first appeal, and only moved to withdraw his guilty plea after his case was remanded. Hearne\u2019s challenge to the validity of his guilty plea is not properly before this court. We previously upheld his conviction, and his case was remanded for resentencing under <em>Booker </em>only. His attempt to relitigate the validity of his guilty plea is beyond the scope of the remand order. <em>See Bell, </em>5 F.3d at 66-67. Therefore, we decline to consider his claim that the district court abused its discretion in denying the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-5\">We affirm the sentence imposed by the district court. We deny Hearne\u2019s motion for leave to file a pro se supplemental brief. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
