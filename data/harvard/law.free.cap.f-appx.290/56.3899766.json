Hubble seeks benefits for the period of May 8, 2002, the date she stopped working due to her condition, through November 23, 2003. Hubble argues that the remand should have been for a calculation of benefits and not for further administrative proceedings. Under these circumstances, we review the district court\u2019s decision to remand for abuse of discretion. <em>Benecke v. Barnhart, </em>379 F.3d 587, 590 (9th Cir.2004). We reverse and remand for a calculation and payment of benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-25\">Here the Commissioner acknowledged, and the district court concluded, that the ALJ erred when he discredited Hubble\u2019s testimony of pain for lack of supporting objective medical evidence. It was legal error to discredit Hubble\u2019s testimony on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>this basis, because she satisfied the test established in <em>Cotton v. Bowen, </em>799 F.2d 1403 (9th Cir.1986), <em>superseded by statute on other grounds as stated in Bunnell v. Sullivan, </em>912 F.2d 1149 (9th Cir.1990), by (1) producing objective evidence of an impairment; and (2) demonstrating that the impairment could reasonably be expected to produce the symptoms alleged; there was no evidence of malingering; and the ALJ failed to provide \u201cclear and convincing\u201d reasons to discredit her testimony. <em>Dodrill v. Shalala, </em>12 F.3d 915, 918 (9th Cir.1993). In its summary judgement ruling, the district court echoed the ALJ\u2019s finding that \u201cPlaintiff has severe impairments consisting of degenerative joint disease and chronic pain. The medical evidence justifies this conclusion.\u201d No. 05-1383, Order at 10 (D.Ariz. Sept. 29, 2006). Accordingly, on this record, we credit her testimony as true. <em>Harman v. Apfel, </em>211 F.3d 1172, 1178-79 (9th Cir.2000) (citing <em>Varney v. Sec\u2019y of Health and Human Servs., </em>859 F.2d 1396, 1398-99 (9th Cir. 1988)).</p>\n<p id=\"b79-5\">Further, it is clear from the vocational expert\u2019s testimony that when Hubble\u2019s testimony is appropriately credited, the ALJ would be required to find Hubble disabled. \u201cWhen an \u2018ALJ\u2019s reasons for rejecting the claimant\u2019s testimony are legally insufficient and it is clear from the record that the ALJ would be required to determine the claimant is disabled if he had credited the claimant\u2019s testimony,\u2019 we remand for a calculation of benefits.\u201d <em>Orn v. Astrue, </em>495 F.3d 625 (9th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b79-6\">REVERSED and REMANDED for a calculation of benefits.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b78-26\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
