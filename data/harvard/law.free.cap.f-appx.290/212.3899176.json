He asserts the district court committed impermissible double counting by enhancing his sentence two levels under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.2 after enhancing his sentence two levels under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Ll.l(b)(6).</p>\n<p id=\"b235-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>The standard of review for a claim of double counting is <em>de novo. United States v. Matos-Rodriguez, </em>188 F.3d 1300, 1310 (11th Cir.1999). \u201cImpermissible double counting occurs only when one part of the Guidelines is applied to increase a defendant\u2019s punishment on account of a kind of harm that has already been fully accounted for by application of another part of the Guidelines.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1309 (quotations omitted). It is presumed the Sentencing Commission intended to apply separate Guidelines sections cumulatively unless there are specific directions otherwise. <em>United States v. Stevenson, </em>68 F.3d 1292, 1294 (11th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b235-5\">In relevant part, under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Ll.l(b)(6), a defendant receives a two-level enhancement if the offense conduct recklessly creates a risk of serious bodily injury to another person. Under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.2, a defendant receives a two-level enhancement if flight from law enforcement recklessly creates a serious risk of bodily injury to another person. If conduct justifying enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Ll.l(b)(6) is solely related to fleeing from law enforcement, then U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.2 should not be applied. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.1, comment, (n.5). In parallel, enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.2 should not be applied where \u201cthe offense guideline in Chapter Two, or another adjustment in Chapter Three, results in an equivalent or greater increase in offense level solely on the basis of the same conduct.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.2, comment. (n.l).</p>\n<p id=\"b235-6\">When acts of reckless conduct are temporally and spatially separated, however, enhancement based on separate Guidelines provisions is permissible. <em>Matos-Rodri-guez, </em>188 F.3d at 1312. In <em>Matos-Rodri-guez, </em>the defendant was in his vehicle when approached and told to stop by a Secret Service agent. Instead of complying, the defendant accelerated toward the agent. Police pursued the defendant\u2019s vehicle. During the pursuit, the defendant drove recklessly, including running stop signs, driving against oncoming traffic, and driving more than double the speed limit. <em>Id. </em>at 1302.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-8\">In computing the Guidelines range, Ma-tos-Rodriguez\u2019s sentence was enhanced under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3A1.2(b) (official victim) and additionally under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.2 (reckless endangerment during flight). <em>Id. </em>at 1303. The defendant asserted that enhancement under both provisions imper-missibly counted his reckless conduct twice. <em>Id. </em>at 1309. We noted the assault on the agent was distinct in time and space from the high speed chase, and the defendant\u2019s conduct at issue \u201cwas not a single, uninterrupted event.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1312. Because there were really two distinct acts of reckless conduct, we held \u201c[t]he enhancements were not levied solely on the basis of the same conduct,\u201d and affirmed the sentence imposed. <em>Id. </em>(quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b235-9\">Rodriguez-Gareia\u2019s claim the district court erred by double counting his reckless conduct to justify two distinct enhancements is without merit because the facts of this case show two distinct moments of reckless conduct leading to two distinct risks of serious bodily injury. First, Rodriguez-Garcia overloaded his vessel with Cuban aliens, supporting an enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Ll.l(b)(b). Second, Rodriguez-Garcia fled the Coast Guard, supporting an enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.2. The two instances of reckless conduct are divided in time by the initial intervention by the Coast Guard. The two instances of reckless conduct are also divided in space by the distance from Havana, where Rodriguez-Garcia loaded his vessel, and 20 miles south of Florida, where the Coast Guard ordered Rodriguez-Garcia to heave <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>to his vessel. Thus, the district court did not commit impermissible double counting because the two acts of reckless conduct were distinct in time and space. Accordingly, we affirm Rodriguez-Garcia\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
