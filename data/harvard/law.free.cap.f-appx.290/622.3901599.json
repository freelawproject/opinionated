Because the Tripps have failed to show that there are genuine issues of material fact that CFAW violated either TILA or the Federal Odometer Act, we affirm the district court\u2019s ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-17\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-18\">On August 7, 1999, the Tripps entered into a deal at CFAW for the purchase of a 1994 Ford Taurus (the \u201cvehicle\u201d), which they intended to finance. After the Tripps had selected the vehicle and negotiated the basic terms of the deal, a CFAW employee placed several documents (the \u201ctransaction documents\u201d) before them to read and sign. The primary transaction documents were as follows: the Buyer\u2019s Order; the Motor Vehicle Installment Sale Contract, which included the Truth-in-Lending Disclosures, the Promissory Note, and the Security Agreement (the \u201ccredit contract\u201d); the Re-Assignment of Title by Virginia Motor Vehicle Dealer Form (the \u201cRe-Assignment Form\u201d); a document entitled \u201cImportant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>Notice;\u201d and the Application for Certificate of Title and Registration.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-4\">The Buyer\u2019s Order itemized the sale price of the vehicle and other amounts to be paid. It also contained an odometer disclosure statement, showing that the vehicle had a total mileage of 67,154 miles. This document included a provision entitled \u201cSeller\u2019s Right to Cancel,\u201d which essentially provided that if the financing deal had not been accepted by the financing company \u2014 Future Finance Company, Inc. (\u201cFuture Finance\u201d) \u2014 the Seller could void the contract. This clause provided for the return of the vehicle and allowed the Buyer to receive his down payment, less any mileage charges or physical damage or other expenses incurred in recovering the vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-5\">The Credit Contract is the document setting forth the terms and conditions of the financing deal in addition to the required TILA disclosures. This document also contained a provision regarding the contingency of the contract on the approval of the financing agreement by Future Finance. The Credit Contract, like the Buyer\u2019s Order, included a section entitled \u201cItemization of Amounts Owed,\u201d which reflected the inclusion of a $395.00 processing fee in the total amount financed.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-6\">The Important Notice document contains an exact reprint of a provision from the sales contract, notifying the buyer and co-buyer that the vehicle must be returned to the dealer if the financing agreement is not approved. The document also included a provision at the top of the page that the buyer is to read the notice carefully and sign below, \u201cacknowledging complete understanding\u201d of the contract and its terms.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-8\">The Re-Assignment Form is a document that transferred title to the vehicle from CFAW to the Tripps and also identified Future Finance as the lienholder on the vehicle. Additionally, this document contained the odometer disclosure statement, which also showed a mileage reading of 67,154 on the date of purchase, August 7,1999.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-9\">Finally, the Application for Certificate of Title and Registration disclosed the owner\u2019s information, the lienholder\u2019s information, as well as the mileage disclosure and the date of purchase.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b646-10\">A CFAW employee presented and explained these documents to the Tripps, and afterwards, the Tripps signed each document, thereby completing the transaction and contractually binding themselves. The deal required the Tripps to make a $1,000 down payment, $500 of which was initially paid the Tripps, with the remaining balance being paid in two installments within the next two weeks. That same day, the Tripps left the dealership with the vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-11\">On August 24, 1999, CFAW informed the Tripps that Future Finance had not approved the deal. CFAW then gave the Tripps the option to restructure a new deal, which would require an additional $500 down payment, or they could return the vehicle. The Tripps did not agree to either of these options, and CFAW subsequently took possession of the vehicle. Thereafter, on August 25, 1999, Mr. Tripp went to CFAW and requested the return of his down payment. He was told that he could receive a refund that day only if he went to the Norfolk dealership. Thereafter, the Tripps went to Norfolk, Virginia, to receive their refund. They were asked again by a CFAW employee to renegotiate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>the deal but refused. Before the Tripps could receive their refund, they were required to sign a Release Form, which purported to release CFAW from any liability and prevent the Tripps from bringing any suit or claim against CFAW regarding the purchase of the vehicle. After deducting the contractual mileage charge, the Tripps received a check in the amount of $656.80 and cashed it that day.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-5\">On August 8, 2000, the Tripps initiated this lawsuit by filing their complaint in the Eastern District of Virginia.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Both parties filed motions for summary judgment: the Tripps moved for summary judgment on the TILA and the Virginia Consumer Protection Act claims, and CFAW moved for summary judgment on the TILA and the Federal Odometer Act claims. After hearing oral argument, the district court found that the Release signed by the Tripps was unenforceable and not supported by adequate consideration, and thus not a valid contract. The district court then ruled on the federal law claims, denying the Tripps\u2019 motion for summary judgment and granting CFAW\u2019s motion for summary judgment. The district court also declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the state law claims and accordingly dismissed those claims.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b647-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-7\">Summary judgment is appropriate when \u201cthe pleadings, the discovery and disclosure materials on file, and any affidavits show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c). In reviewing a grant of summary judgment, we apply the same standards as the district court, and our scope of review is <em>de novo. Seabulk Offshore, Ltd. v. Am. Home Assur. Co., </em>377 F.3d 408, 418 (4th Cir.2004). On summary judgment, any permissible inferences to be drawn from the underlying facts must be viewed in the light most favorable to the party opposing the motion. <em>Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co., Ltd. v. Zenith Radio Corp., </em>475 U.S. 574, 587-88,106 S.Ct. 1348, 89 L.Ed.2d 538 (1986). The Tripps appeal the district court\u2019s ruling granting summary judgment to CFAW on the TILA and the Federal Odometer Act claims as well as its decision to decline jurisdiction over the state law claims. We shall address each claim individually.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-11\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-12\">Under TILA, the Tripps contend that the district court erred in granting summary judgment to CFAW because material issues of fact remain as to whether CFAW complied with TILA by providing the required credit disclosures to the Tripps in the proper form and at the proper time, as mandated by the Act and its regulations. First, they argue that CFAW failed to comply with the form and timing provision of the Act\u2019s disclosure requirements by waiting until after the contract <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>was signed to give the Tripps a copy of the document. Second, they argue that CFAW failed to label the processing fee as a \u201cfinance charge\u201d that was optional for cash purchasers. Third, the Tripps argue that CFAW failed to make known that the TILA disclosures were estimates. Finally, as a result of these violations, the Tripps contend that they are entitled to statutory damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-4\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-5\">TILA was passed by Congress in order to \u201cassure a meaningful disclosure of credit terms so that the consumer will be able to compare more readily the various credit terms available to him and avoid the uninformed use of credit .... \u201d 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1601(a); <em>see also Mourning v. Family Publ\u2019ns Serv., Inc., </em>411 U.S. 356, 363 and n. 20, 93 S.Ct. 1652, 36 L.Ed.2d 318 (1973). TILA mandates that creditors make specific disclosures before extending credit to consumers. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1638(a), (b). The Federal Reserve Board (\u201cFRB\u201d), the agency charged with administering the statute, has adopted Regulation Z to implement the Act\u2019s mandates and methods of disclosure. <em>See </em>12 C.F.R. Part 226 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b648-6\">TILA requires a lender to disclose to a borrower, among other things, the amount financed, the finance charge, the annual percentage rate, and the total sale price. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1638; 12 C.F.R. \u00a7 226.18. In closed-end transactions, like the one in this case, the creditor must make the specified disclosures \u201cclearly and conspicuously in writing, in a form that the consumer may keep\u201d before \u201cconsummation<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> of the transaction,\u201d i.e., before the credit is extended. 12 C.F.R. \u00a7 226.17(a), (b); <em>see also </em>15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1638(b). The Amended Commentary to the regulation states that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"azg-dedup-0\">Creditors are not required to give the consumer two separate copies of the document before consummation, one for the consumer to keep and a second copy for the consumer to execute. <em>The disclosure requirement is satisfied if the creditor gives a copy of the document containing the unexecuted credit contract and disclosures to the consumer to read and sign; and the consumer receives a copy to keep at the time the consumer becomes obligated. </em>It is not sufficient for the creditor merely to show the consumer the document containing the disclosures before the consumer signs and becomes obligated. The consumer must be free to take possession of and review the document in its entirety before signing.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b648-10\">67 Fed.Reg. 16983 (April 9, 2002) (emphasis added).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b648-11\">We have had the opportunity to address the plain meaning of this regulation in <em>Polk v. Crown Auto, Inc., </em>221 F.3d 691 (4th Cir.2000) <em>{Polk I). </em>There, the issue before the court was \u201cwhether a seller is required to make the required disclosures in writing and in a form that the consumer can keep <em>before </em>consummation, or whether Regulation Z is satisfied as long as the disclosures are made in some form [i.e., orally] before consummation and the consumer later receives the disclosures in writing, in a form that he can keep.\u201d <em>Polk </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number><em>I, </em>221 F.3d at 692. We held there that the plain meaning of the statute was clear, in that written disclosures must be provided to the consumer in a form that he could keep before consummation of the transaction. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b649-5\">Turning to the facts in this case, the Tripps contend that CFAW violated TILA because they did not provide the Tripps with the document containing the TILA disclosures in a form they could keep prior to consummation, i.e., they were not given physical possession of the document as opposed to simply viewing it. However, contrary to the Tripps\u2019 interpretation, nothing in the statute or the case law requires actual, physical possession of the documents to satisfy the Act\u2019s provisions. As long as disclosures are made in writing before the transaction is complete, the requirements under the statute and the regulations are met.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-6\">Here, the record shows that a CFAW employee provided the transaction documents and credit disclosures to the Tripps before signing, i.e., before the transaction was consummated, and the Tripps had the opportunity to read the documents before signing. This manner of presenting the documents satisfied the form and timing requirements. <em>Polk I, </em>221 F.3d at 692; <em>see </em>Regulation Z, 67 Fed.Reg. at 16983 (\u201cThe disclosure requirement is satisfied if the creditor gives a copy of the document containing the unexecuted credit contract and disclosures to the consumer to read and sign; and the consumer receives a copy to keep at the time the consumer becomes obligated.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b649-7\">TILA does not compel the consumer to take the document, although they are not prevented from doing so. Nor does TILA compel the consumer to read it, although it is perhaps a prudent thing to do. The Tripps admitted several times that they did not read the contract or all of the documents placed before them. The Tripps also acknowledged during their deposition testimony that CAFW gave them the transaction documents and explained \u201cmost of the important numbers.\u201d (J.A. 276). Furthermore, the Tripps stated that the CFAW employee asked them to sign the document \u201cif all of that [the terms] was agreeable to [them].\u201d (J.A. 276). Their signature is evidence that the disclosed credit terms were \u201cagreeable\u201d to them.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-9\">Additionally, one of the stated purposes of TILA is to allow consumers to use these disclosures and \u201ccompare more readily the various credit terms,\u201d presumably with other creditors. The Tripps admitted in their depositions that they were not going to \u201cshop around\u201d to other dealerships because they were told that they were approved for a car, and there was no reason to continue searching. (J.A. 259-60). While that fact does not relieve CFAW of its obligations to comply with the statute, it diminishes the likelihood of a violation, and it certainly minimizes any potential harm or damage, if any, to the Tripps by CFAW\u2019s actions. Nevertheless, the record shows that CFAW did provide the Tripps the disclosures in writing in a form they could keep prior to consummation. Thus, we find that there were no violations of the form and timing requirements as provided under TILA.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-10\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-11\">The Tripps next contend that CFAW violated TILA by failing to label the $395 processing fee as a \u201cfinance charge\u201d that was optional for cash purchasers. As stated above, the \u201cfinance charge\u201d is one of the items that must be disclosed to consumers. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1638(a)(3); <em>see also </em>12 C.F.R. \u00a7 226.18 (requiring disclosure and itemization of, <em>inter alia, </em>the finance charge and the amount financed). Under TILA, a \u201cfinance charge\u201d is any charge \u201cimposed di<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>rectly or indirectly by the creditor as an incident to the extension of credit,\u201d but it \u201cdoes not include charges of a type payable in a comparable cash transaction.\u201d 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1605(a); <em>see also </em>12 C.F.R. \u00a7 226.4(a). The reason is that such charges cannot be considered as having been imposed \u201cas an incident to the extension of credit.\u201d To prevail under this provision of TILA, a plaintiff must provide evidence that a fee was incident to the extension of credit and not charged in comparable cash transactions. <em>See Polk v. Crown Auto, Inc., </em>228 F.3d 541, 542 (4th Cir.2000) <em>(Polk II); see also Alston v. Crown Auto, Inc., </em>224 F.3d 332, 334 (4th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b650-4\">The Tripps argue that they presented evidence that an issue of fact was raised about whether CFAW charged them a mandatory processing fee that was optional for cash purchasers. They point to the deposition testimony of Mr. Timothy Doe, who testified on behalf of CFAW for a previous case in 1999 where CFAW was involved. Mr. Doe testified during a deposition in that case that the processing fee would not have been charged to a customer who purchased a vehicle with cash. (J.A. 178-79, 664-65). Mr. Doe later corrected himself, after having taken a break and reviewed the relevant documents, and came back on the record to explain that he had been mistaken on one of his previous answers and that the $395 processing was charged on all transactions \u2014 both cash and credit. (J.A. 666-67).</p>\n<p id=\"b650-5\">In this case, Mr. Doe testified that regardless of whether the transaction is one for cash or credit, the $395 processing fee is charged to all customers for the necessary title work. (JA. 629-633). In addition, documents produced by CFAW show that in 1999, when the Tripps purchased their vehicle, CFAW\u2019s general practice was to charge the fee to both cash and credit customers.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Moreover, these documents \u2014 the Buyer\u2019s Purchase Orders\u2014 clearly indicate that the seller\u2019s processing fee is \u201capplicable to Cash or Credit Sales.\u201d (J.A. 414-31). Because the Tripps have not produced evidence to refute CFAWs general practice of charging the $395 processing for both cash and credit transactions, we find that the $395 processing fee was not a \u201cfinance charge\u201d under TILA, and CFAW was not required to disclose it as a \u201cfinance charge.\u201d <em>Polk II, </em>228 F.3d at 542 (4th Cir.2000) (finding that $85 processing fee was not a \u201cfinance charge\u201d under TILA and that dealer was not required to disclose it as such); <em>Alston, 224 </em>F.3d at 334 (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b650-10\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-11\">The Tripps next argue that CFAW violated TILA by failing to make known that the disclosures were estimates. They underscore their argument by contending that the district court erred in failing to determine whether the contract was one with a condition precedent or a condition subsequent so as to establish the effective date of the contract and thus determine whether the disclosures were accurate at that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-12\">TILA requires that the credit disclosures \u201creflect the terms of the legal obligation of the parties.\u201d 12 C.F.R. \u00a7 226.17(c)(1). Disclosures must be labeled as estimates when \u201cany information necessary for an accurate disclosure is unknown to the creditor.\u201d 12 C.F.R. \u00a7 226.17(c)(2)(i). Moreover, even If the information disclosed under TILA is \u201csubsequently rendered inaccurate as the result of any act, occurrence, or agreement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>subsequent to the delivery of the required disclosures, the inaccuracy resulting therefrom does not constitute a violation.\u201d 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1634.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-5\">For purposes of TILA, the crux of the inquiry begins and ends at the moment when the transaction is consummated. As we have held previously, when the consumer has signed the buyer\u2019s order and the retail installment sales contract, the transaction is \u201cconsummated.\u201d <em>Nigh v. Koons Buick Pontiac GMC, Inc., </em>319 F.3d 119, 124 (4th Cir.2003), <em>rev'd on other grounds, </em>543 U.S. 50,125 S.Ct. 460, 160 L.Ed.2d 389 (2004). Relying on <em>Nigh, </em>we concluded in <em>Gibson v. LTD, Inc., </em>that \u201cwhen the purchaser of a motor vehicle signs a retail installment sales contract after which he no longer can alter the terms of credit and after which the dealer retains the exclusive right to decide when the financing arrangement takes effect, the transaction is \u2018consummated\u2019 for TILA purposes.\u201d 434 F.3d 275, 281 (4th Cir.2006); <em>Nigh, </em>319 F.3d at 124; <em>see also Bragg v. Bill Heard Chevrolet, Inc., </em>374 F.3d 1060, 1066 (11th Cir.2004) (adopting <em>Nigh </em>as being consistent with Regulation Z and the consumer\u2019s obligations for unfunded financing agreements).</p>\n<p id=\"b651-6\">Here, when the Tripps signed the contract documents on August 7, 1999, the transaction was consummated, thereby contractually obligating the Tripps to the terms of the deal. If the credit contract had been approved at a later time, the effective date of the contract would relate back to the date of consummation \u2014 August 7, 1999. The credit contract stated, in addition to the Important Notice, that the contract was \u201ccontingent on Future Finance Company, Inc. or other assignee approving and purchasing the contract from seller.\u201d (J.A. 357). It goes on to explain that \u201cin the event the contract is not purchased from seller for whatever reason, the contract shall be voidable at the sole option of the seller.\u201d <em>Id. </em>If the financing company had approved and agreed to purchase the credit contract, then the Tripps would have been legally obligated to purchase the vehicle at the terms disclosed on the credit contract; those terms could not be altered by the Tripps. If the financing company had not approved the contract, then the contract was voidable, since there would (most likely) be no contract. As such, the terms disclosed under the credit contract need not have been disclosed by CFAW as estimates \u2014 those were the amounts disclosed to the Tripps that they were obligated to under the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-8\">The Seventh Circuit case of <em>Janikowski v. Lynch Ford, Inc., </em>210 F.3d 765 (7th Cir.2000), is also instructive on this point. There, the court affirmed the entry of summary judgment to the dealer where the plaintiff entered into a new contract to buy a vehicle at an 11.9% interest rate, when the dealer could not obtain financing at the initial contract rate of 5.9%. <em>Id. </em>at 767. The court rejected Plaintiffs argument that the 5.9% interest rate was an estimate, stating that it was not an estimate but rather, the contractual rate, and thus, an \u201caccurate disclosure for that contract\u201d since it \u201ccould not and did not vary under its terms.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 768. The court went on to explain that had the financing condition been satisfied, the plaintiff would have been obligated to purchase the vehicle at the 5.9% interest rate. <em>Id. </em>The plaintiff could have canceled the contract and refused to purchase the vehicle, but \u201c[ejither way, the disclosed rate was a set rate, not an estimate.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b651-9\">Moreover, contrary to the Tripps argument, the determination of whether the contract was one with a condition precedent or a condition subsequent is unnecessary. Consummation has still occurred with the signing of the unfunded credit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>contract by the Tripps. The sales contract states that the sale is \u201cnot contingent upon financing on terms that are satisfactory to Buyer, yet [is] contingent upon acceptance of this contract by Future Finance Company or other Assignee.\u201d (J.A. 355). As we have stated before, as long as the dealer, and not the consumer, had control over satisfaction of the terms, we need not reach the issue of condition-precedent or condition-subsequent. <em>See Gibson, </em>434 F.3d at 282.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-4\">D.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-5\">Next, the Tripps contend that they are entitled to statutory damages for CFAW\u2019s violations under TILA\u2019s form and timing requirements and that fact issues remain as to whether CFAW provided the Tripps with the substantive disclosures in a form they could keep before consummation. We disagree. Since we have found that there were no violations of the form and timing requirements or of the manner in which the disclosures were given to the Tripps, we find that the Tripps are not entitled to any damages under TILA. As a result, the district court properly granted summary judgment to CFAW on the TILA claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-6\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-7\">Under the Federal Odometer Act (\u201cFOA\u201d), the Tripps argue that the district court erred in granting summary judgment to CFAW because material issues of fact remained regarding whether CFAW violated the Act, particularly regarding whether the \u201cintent to defraud\u201d element was present.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-8\">FOA requires that persons transferring ownership of a motor vehicle must disclose to the transferee, in writing, the \u201ccumulative mileage registered on the odometer.\u201d 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 32705(a)(1)(A). The purpose behind the act was to \u201cprohibit tampering with motor vehicle odometers\u201d and \u201cto provide safeguards to protect purchasers in the sale of motor vehicles with altered or reset odometers.\u201d 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 32701(b). However, it is important to note that FOA\u2019s disclosure provisions are not implicated until ownership of the vehicle is transferred. 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 32705(a)(1); <em>see also </em>49 C.F.R. \u00a7 580.5(c). FOA defines \u201ctransfer\u201d to mean \u201cto change ownership by sale, gift, or any other means.\u201d 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 32702(8).</p>\n<p id=\"b652-13\">FOA prohibits the transferor from making false statements to the transferee surrounding the required mileage disclosures. 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 32705(a)(2). We have interpreted this prohibition to mean that FOA is violated when the mileage specified on the disclosure statement fails to correspond with the vehicle\u2019s actual number of miles traveled, even if the stated mileage does correspond to the odometer reading at the time of sale. <em>Ryan v. Edwards, </em>592 F.2d 756, 760 (4th Cir.1979).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Civil liability arises under FOA only if a person violating the Act did so with \u201cintent to defraud.\u201d 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 32710; <em>Ryan, </em>592 F.2d at 761.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-14\">At the outset, we note that Virginia is considered a \u201cstrict title\u201d state, which means that transfer of ownership of a motor vehicle requires the assignment of title. <em>Allstate Ins. Co. v. Atlanta Cas. Co., </em>260 Va. 148, 155, 530 S.E.2d 161, 165 (2000); <em>Rawl\u2019s Auto Auction v. Dick Herriman Ford, Inc., </em>690 F.2d 422, 426-27 (4th Cir. 1982) (citing <em>Thomas v. Mullins, </em>153 Va. 383, 149 S.E. 494 (1929)). FOA allows title to be transferred on a Reassignment of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>Title Form as long as the mileage and other required disclosures are provided on that document. 49 C.F.R. \u00a7 580.5(b),(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b653-5\">Before proceeding to the substance of FOA, we must first determine whether the FOA\u2019s requirements are triggered\u2014 whether title (i.e., ownership) was transferred to the Tripps. Reviewing the facts of this case, we find that ownership of the vehicle did not transfer to the Tripps, and, thus, did not trigger the requirements of FOA. First, the Tripps admit that title to the vehicle was never transferred to them. In their complaint, they state that CFAW never \u201csigned title of the car over to the Tripps.\u201d (J.A. 19, 24). Additionally, in Virginia, ownership is transferred whenever title has been assigned to the transferee. <em>Allstate Ins. Co., </em>260 Va. at 155, 580 S.E.2d at 165. Here, since the credit contract was not approved by Future Finance and the contract was voided by CFAW, title was never assigned to the Tripps. The Tripps merely had possession of the vehicle between the time they signed the credit contract and the time the vehicle was returned to CFAW. As it remains, there is no viable claim under FOA.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-6\">To the extent that title somehow did transfer to the Tripps, we find that the disclosure requirements of FOA had been satisfied. CFAW, in accordance with the regulations, was entitled to use a valid ReAssignment of Title document (that would have eventually transferred title to the Tripps) since title to the vehicle was not in CFAW\u2019s name. 49 C.F.R. \u00a7 580.5(c). Title was actually in the name of Crestar, with a reassignment to CFAW. (J.A. 47, 787).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> As shown from the Crestar title, CFAW obtained a written assignment of title on July 24, 1999, from Crestar, and no new title was issued in CFAW\u2019s name. On August 7, 1999, when the Tripps signed the credit contract and were given possession of the vehicle, title of the vehicle remained in Crestar\u2019s name.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-12\">On July 24, 1999, Crestar disclosed the mileage of the vehicle as 67,149 miles, when it assigned the vehicle\u2019s title to CFAW. (J.A. 47, 787). Two weeks later, on August 7, 1999, CFAW disclosed the mileage to the Tripps on the Re-Assignment form as 67,154 miles (J.A. 778, 358). This reading was taken after a short test drive by the Tripps. (J.A. 728, 393). On the Re-Assignment of Title form, CFAW properly disclosed the mileage at the time the form was executed. In addition to the odometer reading at the time of transfer, the form also had the other disclosures as required under the regulation: the date of transfer, the transferor\u2019s name and current address; the transferee\u2019s name and current address; and the identity of the vehicle, including the make, model, year, and body type; and its vehicle identification number. <em>See </em>49 C.F.R. 580.5(c). Moreover, no evidence has been produced by the Tripps to refute these odometer readings as inaccurate.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-13\">Finding that there were no violations of FOA, we need not reach the issue of CFAWs alleged \u201cintent to defraud.\u201d Furthermore, the law was envisioned to protect consumers from unscrupulous dealers who were intentionally trying to conceal a vehicle\u2019s mileage and take advantage of unsuspecting buyers who were relying upon those disclosures in assessing the safety and reliability of a vehicle. The facts and circumstances of this case do not present that situation. Here, CFAW properly recorded the mileage of the vehicle from the title to the re-assignment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>form, and the various documents and testimony do not present any material issues of fact as being in dispute with regard to the mileage disclosure. As such, the district court properly granted summary judgment to CFAW under FOA.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-4\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-5\">Finally, the Tripps argue that the district court erred in dismissing their remaining state law claims. The district court, having disposed of the Tripps\u2019 federal claims under TILA and FOA, declined to exercise its supplemental jurisdiction over the state law claims. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1367(c). A district court has the inherent power to dismiss a case having only state law claims provided that the conditions for declining supplemental jurisdiction under 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1367(c) have been met. <em>Hinson v. Norwest Fin. S.C., Inc., </em>239 F.3d 611, 617 (4th Cir.2001). Here, the district court declined to hear the remaining state law claims since the federal claims over which it had original jurisdiction had been dropped from the case through summary judgment. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1367(c)(3). These remaining claims could not provide a basis for original jurisdiction under federal question, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> As stated earlier, exercising supplemental jurisdiction is within the discretion of the district court and since the district court here properly granted summary judgment to CFAW on the federal law claims, we find that there was no abuse of discretion in dismissing the state law claims. <em>See Shanaghan v. Cahill, </em>58 F.3d 106, 110 (4th Cir.l995)(acknowledging that district courts \u201cenjoy wide latitude in determining whether or not to retain jurisdiction over state claims when all federal claims have been extinguished.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b654-7\">VI.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-8\">Based on the foregoing discussion, the judgment of the district court is therefore</p>\n<p id=\"b654-9\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b646-7\">.

There has been quite a delay in the completion of this appeal. The Tripps filed their Notice of Appeal on September 19, 2001. However, on February 7, 2002, after the Tripps filed their opening brief but before CFAW (and Future Finance) filed their response brief, the case was suspended pending the resolution of a Chapter 11 bankruptcy petition filed by Future Finance. <em>See In re Future Finance Company, Inc., </em>Case No. 02-DHA-70457 in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Eastern District of Virginia, Norfolk Division.

I will address the Tripps\u2019 other TILA theories seriatim.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-14\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-15\">The Tripps first argue that the district court erred in concluding they had not created a genuine factual issue concerning whether CFAW violated TILA by waiting until after the credit contract was signed to give them a copy of the document containing the TILA disclosures. I agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-16\">In enacting TILA, Congress declared that \u201c[i]t is the purpose of this subchapter to assure a meaningful disclosure of credit terms so that the consumer will be able to compare more readily the various credit terms available to him and avoid the un<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number>informed use of credit.\u201d 15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1601(a) (West 1998). TILA specifically authorizes the Federal Reserve Board (\u201cFRB\u201d) to adopt regulations to carry out TILA\u2019s purposes. <em>See </em>15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1604(a) (West 1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b655-5\">The transaction at issue in this case was a closed-end credit transaction governed by 15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1638 (West 1998 &amp; Supp. 2008) and \u201cRegulation Z.\u201d <em>See </em>12 C.F.R. pt. 226, subpt. C (2008). With such transactions, the creditor is required to disclose, <em>inter alia, </em>the amount financed, the finance charge, the annual percentage rate, and the total sale price. <em>See </em>15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1638(a); 12 C.F.R. \u00a7 226.18. These disclosures must be made before the transaction is consummated. See 15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1638(b); 12 C.F.R. \u00a7 226.17(b). The disclosures also must be made \u201cclearly and conspicuously in writing, in a form that the consumer may keep.\u201d 12 C.F.R. \u00a7 226.17(a)(1). Official Staff Commentary to the regulation clarifies the meaning of \u201cform that the consumer may keep\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b655-6\">The disclosure requirement is satisfied if the creditor gives a copy of the document containing the unexecuted credit contract and disclosures to the consumer to read and sign; and the consumer receives a copy to keep at the time the consumer becomes obligated. It is not sufficient for the creditor merely to <em>show </em>the consumer the document containing the disclosures before the consumer signs and becomes obligated. The consumer must be free to take possession of and review the document in its entirety before signing.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b655-7\">12 C.F.R. pt. 226, Official Staff Commentary 17(b)(3) (emphasis added). This rule that simply <em>showing </em>the disclosures to the consumer rather than allowing him to take possession of them furthers TILA\u2019s purpose of allowing consumers \u201cto compare more readily the various credit terms available.\u201d 15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1601. If merely allowing a consumer to view the disclosures were sufficient and allowing the consumer to take possession of the disclosures were not required, consumers seeking to shop different creditors\u2019 terms would need to memorize all of the figures as they proceeded from lender to lender.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-9\">Here, the Tripps stated in their affidavits and depositions that CFAW merely <em>showed </em>them the relevant documents but never <em>gave </em>them the documents until the documents were signed. According to the Tripps, they did not know CFAW would allow them to take a copy of its documents so that they could compare the terms offered to those offered by another lender. I therefore would hold that the Tripps created a genuine factual issue regarding whether CFAW\u2019s disclosures satisfied TILA\u2019s requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-10\">CFAW argues it forecast evidence that had the Tripps decided to reject the terms disclosed on the credit contract, CFAW would have allowed them to walk away from the deal with a copy of the unsigned credit contract. In support of this claim, CFAW points to the following excerpt from the affidavit of Tim Doe, CFAW\u2019s business manager:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b655-11\">If a CFAW customer decides to reject the credit terms disclosed on the Credit Contract or on a separate form, even after signing a Buyer\u2019s Order, he or she may discontinue and cancel the entire transaction. In this situation, CFAW has no policy against a customer leaving the CFAW dealership with an unexecut-ed copy of the Credit Contract, which contains the credit terms mandated by [TILA]....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b655-12\">J.A. 391. CFAW\u2019s argument notwithstanding, CFAW\u2019s internal policy or secret intentions that were never communicated to the Tripps are not sufficient to discharge CFAW\u2019s TILA obligations. Until CFAW gave the document to the Tripps, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"634\">*634</page-number>or at least told them they could have it, the Tripps were certainly not \u201cfree to take possession of\u2019 CFAWs document. The FRB\u2019s Staff Commentary clearly provides that merely showing the disclosures to the consumer is not sufficient, and the Tripps forecast evidence that that was all CFAW did in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-4\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-5\">Despite my belief that the Tripps created a genuine factual issue regarding whether CFAW violated TILA by waiting until after the credit contract was signed to give them a copy of the TILA disclosures, in the end, I, like the majority, conclude that this liability theory fails as a matter of law. The district court concluded that, even if CFAW did not comply with Regulation Z\u2019s form and timing requirements, the Tripps\u2019 liability theory failed because (1) the Tripps failed to create a fact issue regarding whether they were actually injured from this alleged violation since they had no intention of shopping for better credit terms with other dealers, and (2) statutory damages were not available for the violation of untimely providing the required \u00a7 1638 disclosures. The Tripps do not challenge the first conclusion, but they do maintain that proof of a \u00a7 1638(b) violation would entitle them to statutory damages, and thus that failure to prove damages is not a basis on which summary judgment may be affirmed. However, for the reasons explained in <em>Baker v. Sunny Chevrolet, Inc., </em>349 F.3d 862, 865-69 (6th Cir.2003), I agree with the district court that statutory damages are not allowed for a defendant\u2019s untimely presentation of the required TILA disclosures, <em>see also Brown v. Payday Check Advance, Inc., </em>202 F.3d 987, 990-92 (7th Cir.2000) (holding that statutory damages are available only for violations of subsections specifically enumerated in \u00a7 1640(a)), and I would affirm the grant of summary judgment regarding this theory on this basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-7\">The Tripps next argue that the district court erred in determining they had not created a genuine issue of material fact regarding whether the $395 processing fee was required to be included in the \u201camount financed.\u201d I agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-8\">TILA defines \u201cfinance charge,\u201d as is relevant here, as \u201cthe sum of all charges, payable directly or indirectly by the person to whom the credit is extended, and imposed directly or indirectly by the creditor as an incident to the extension of credit.\u201d 15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1605(a) (West 1998). \u201cThe finance charge does not include charges of a type payable in a comparable cash transaction.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In order to ensure that the finance charge disclosed to the consumer is the actual cost of obtaining credit, TILA prohibits a creditor from including a finance charge as an element of the \u201camount financed.\u201d <em>See </em>12 C.F.R. \u00a7 226.18 (requiring disclosure and itemization of, <em>inter alia, </em>the finance charge and the amount financed).</p>\n<p id=\"b656-9\">I believe that the Tripps created a genuine issue of material fact regarding whether, at the time they purchased their vehicle, CFAW was charging the $395 processing fee to every customer; and for that reason, I believe they also created a genuine issue of material fact regarding whether CFAW should have disclosed the $395 processing fee as part of the finance charge. Doe testified at a deposition in another case in April 1999 that \u201cthe services [CFAW provides in exchange] for the processing fee relate only to the title documents,\u201d and that the fee is charged on every sale because CFAW needs to ensure that the lien is properly recorded on the title. J.A. 178. Doe explained that his endorsement of a check received from another lender \u201cguarantees lien and title delivered to\u201d that lender. J.A. 179. However, Doe also testified that if the custom<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number>er paid cash \u2014 as opposed to borrowing money from CFAW or another lender\u2014 Doe \u201cwould give [the customer] the title documents,\u201d let them do the title work, and not charge them the processing fee. J.A. 179. At that point in the deposition, CFAW\u2019s lawyer requested a break and conferred with Doe. When the deposition continued, Doe testified that he had come to realize, after reviewing documents, that his prior testimony was a mistake and that in fact the processing fee was charged in every case.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-5\">In a deposition in the present case taken in May 2001, Doe reiterated that the $395 processing fee is charged regardless of how the customer paid for his car. And, the summary judgment record includes what CFAW contends is paperwork for the sales CFAW made for the months surrounding the Tripp transaction, which CFAW maintains shows that the processing fee was charged to every customer, even when there was no lien to be recorded. Nevertheless, I believe that a reasonable factfinder could credit Doe\u2019s initial testimony that if the customer paid cash\u2014 as opposed to borrowing money from CFAW or another lender \u2014 Doe would not charge them the processing fee, and discredit Doe\u2019s contrary testimony as being simply the result of CFAW\u2019s counsel\u2019s legal advice. <em>Cf. Thorn v. Sundstrand, Aerospace Corp., </em>207 F.3d 383, 389 (7th Cir. 2000) (explaining that when deponent changes his deposition testimony, it is for the jury to decide which testimony to believe); <em>Podell v. Citicorp Diners Club, Inc., </em>112 F.3d 98, 103 (2d Cir.1997) (explaining that even when a deponent withdraws his previous deposition testimony, the withdrawn testimony remains part of the record).</p>\n<p id=\"b657-6\">If CFAW did not charge the processing fee in sales with no lien, then CFAW did not charge the fee in cash transactions that were comparable to the Tripps\u2019 and the fee should have been included as part of the finance charge. Although CFAW could still maintain that it charged the fee in comparable transactions because it charged the fee to customers who borrow from outside lenders and pay with cashier\u2019s checks, those transactions are not comparable to the Tripps\u2019, in my view. In Doe\u2019s April 1999 deposition, he testified that CFAW charges the processing fee to buyers paying with cashier\u2019s checks from outside lenders because CFAWs endorsement of those checks acts as its guarantee that the lien will be properly recorded. Because no such guarantee was involved in the Tripps\u2019 transaction, it cannot be said as a matter of law that these transactions were comparable to the Tripps\u2019.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-8\">Relying on <em>Alston v. Crown Auto, Inc., </em>224 F.3d 332 (4th Cir.2000) (per curiam), CFAW argues the transactions that did not involve a lien represented only a small minority of its sales, and it need not charge the fee in every transaction for it to be properly considered part of the amount financed rather than part of the finance charge. <em>See Alston, </em>224 F.3d at 334 (holding that processing fee was not finance charge when general practice was to charge the fee regardless of whether customer paid with cash or credit). But, <em>Alston </em>is distinguishable from the present case in that the critical fact in <em>Alston </em>was that the seller\u2019s general policy was to charge the fee to everyone; the two cash customers who did not pay the fee had individually negotiated for that arrangement. <em>See id. </em>If CFAW\u2019s policy was not to charge the fee in no-lien sales, however, then the fee was not generally charged in comparable cash transactions, and it should have been included as part of the finance charge. I therefore would reverse the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment against the Tripps on this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"636\">*636</page-number>III.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-4\">The district court, having granted summary judgment on all of the Tripps\u2019 federal claims, declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over their state claims. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1367(c)(3) (West 2006). Because I would reverse the grant of summary judgment on the TILA claim, I would also reverse the district court\u2019s refusal to exercise supplemental jurisdiction on the state law claims. <em>See Gruenke v. Seip, </em>225 F.3d 290, 308 (3d Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b658-5\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-6\">In sum, I would reverse the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment on the TILA claim that the $395 processing fee was required to be included in the \u201camount financed,\u201d vacate the district court\u2019s dismissal of the state law claims, and remand the TILA and state law claims to the district court for further proceedings. For the reasons expressed in Part I of my opinion and Parts III(C) and IV of the majority opinion, I would otherwise affirm the district court\u2019s order granting summary judgment against the Tripps.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
