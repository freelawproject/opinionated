He has filed a motion to supplement the record with his sentencing memorandum. The motion to supplement is granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-4\">Contreras-Hernandez argues that his sentence is unreasonable because the district court considered his arrest record when determining the point within the advisory sentencing guidelines range that he should be sentenced. Contreras argues that his general objection to the unreasonableness of his sentence preserved this argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-5\">To avoid plain-error review, an appellant \u201cmust raise a claim of error with the district court in such a manner so that the district court may correct itself and thus, obviate the need for our review.\u201d <em>United States v. Rodriguez, </em>15 F.3d 408, 414 (5th Cir.1994) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted); <em>see United States v. Hernandez-Martinez, </em>485 F.3d 270, 272 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 325, 169 L.Ed.2d 229 (2007). Contreras\u2019s objection to the reasonableness of his sentence did not sufficiently preserve the argument that he now asserts; as a result, plain error review applies. <em>See Hernandez-Martinez, </em>485 F.3d at 273. To establish plain error, a defendant must demonstrate error that is clear and obvious and that affects his substantial rights; then we may exercise discretion to correct the forfeited error if it \u201cseriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 273.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-8\">The district court did not plainly err in sentencing Contreras. The record does not demonstrate that the district court relied on Contreras\u2019s prior arrests in fashioning his sentence. Moreover, Contreras fails to present any evidence to rebut the presumption of reasonableness attached to his within-guidelines sentence. <em>See United States v. Alonzo, </em>435 F.3d 551, 554 (5th Cir.2006); <em>Rita v. United States, </em>- U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2462-65, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007). The judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-12\">AFFIRMED; MOTION TO SUPPLEMENT GRANTED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b743-20\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
