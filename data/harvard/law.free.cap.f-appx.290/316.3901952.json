Stephan Botes was convicted of conspiracy to embezzle federal funds by a state agent and conspiracy to commit a scheme to defraud the State of Georgia and its citizens of money and honest services (Count 1), embezzlement of federal funds (Counts 2-12), and wire fraud (Counts 18, 20-21). He was sentenced to 97-months\u2019 imprisonment and the district court entered an order of restitution and a criminal forfeiture judgment against him in the amount of $382,894.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-20\">On appeal, Botes argues the following: (1) the denial of Botes\u2019s mistrial motion following the lead prosecutor\u2019s selection for a federal magistrate judgeship requires reversal of his convictions; (2) the evidence was not sufficient to support his conviction for conspiracy to defraud the state of Georgia and deprive Georgia of the honest services of state school superintendent Linda Schrenko; (3) the evidence was not sufficient to show that Botes aided and abetted a scheme to defraud Georgia; (4) the district court improperly instructed the jury on aiding and abetting; (5) the evidence was not sufficient to show that Botes engaged in a scheme to defraud Georgia via wires; (6) the district court\u2019s evidentiary rulings concerning testimony by Botes\u2019s business attorney Kauffmann and Schrenko require reversal; (7) the cumulative effect of the evidentiary rulings requires reversal; (8) the denial of Botes\u2019s requests for specific jury instructions deprived Botes of his right to present a theory of defense; (9) the district court improperly enhanced Botes\u2019s sentence for obstruction of justice under \u00a7 3C1.1 of the sentencing guidelines; (10) his sentence was unreasonable; (11) the sentencing court violated Botes\u2019s Sixth Amendment rights when it considered facts that were neither admitted by Botes nor found by the jury as part of their verdict; (12) the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>sentencing court denied Botes his right of allocution; (13) the factual basis for the order of restitution was clearly erroneous; (14) the order of forfeiture violated Botes\u2019s constitutional rights and was without statutory authority; and (15) Botes is entitled to access backup audiotape recordings of closing arguments and sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-5\">Upon careful review of the record and the parties\u2019 briefs, and with the benefit of having heard oral argument, we conclude that Botes\u2019s arguments have no merit. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
