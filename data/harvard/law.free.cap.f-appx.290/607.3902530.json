DuPont de Nemours &amp; Co., (\u201cDuPont\u201d) appeals the district court\u2019s decision denying its motion for summary judgment and partially granting Ampthill Rayon Workers Incorporated\u2019s (\u201cARWI\u201d) cross motion for summary judgment. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-15\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-16\">We adopt the facts as set out by the district court, <em>see E.I. DuPont De Nem-ours and Co. v. Ampthill Rayon Workers, Inc., </em>516 F.Supp.2d 588 (E.D.Va.2007), and summarize only the facts relevant to the parties\u2019 dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-17\">DuPont offers its employees throughout the country, union and non-unionized, a number of benefit plans (\u201cplans\u201d), all of which are governed by ERISA, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001 <em>et seq., </em>with the exception of the Vacation Plan.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In August 2006, DuPont sent out a memorandum to all of its employees informing them about amendments to the plans. Some of the amendments decreased the benefits available to the employees under the plans.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-18\">ARWI represents about 1000 DuPont employees who work at DuPont\u2019s Spruance Fibers Plant in Ampthill, Virginia. These employees come from the Production and Maintenance Unit and the Clerical, Technical, and Office Unit. While employees in each unit signed separate Collective Bargaining Agreements (\u201cCBAs\u201d) with DuPont, for purposes of this dispute, the relevant provisions from each CBA are the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>As a result of DuPont\u2019s 2006 amendments (\u201camendments\u201d) to the plans, ARWI, following the procedures outlined in the CBAs, initiated a grievance against DuPont alleging that the amendments violated the CBAs.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> While DuPont initially agreed to arbitrate the dispute, it subsequently reversed course and filed a Complaint in federal district court. Shortly thereafter, DuPont submitted an Amended Complaint seeking a declaratory judgment stating, <em>inter alia, </em>that ARWI should resolve its grievance by utilizing each plan\u2019s internal claim procedure or in the alternative, by filing a civil suit in federal court under Section 502(a)(1)(B) of ERISA, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1132(a)(1)(B).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In addition, DuPont sought injunctive relief barring ARWI from resolving its grievance in arbitration. ARWI filed a Counterclaim alleging that the amendments violated the CBAs and seeking a ruling requiring DuPont to litigate ARWI\u2019s grievance in arbitration.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-5\">The parties then filed cross motions for summary judgment. DuPont argued, <em>inter alia, </em>that since the amendments implicated the terms, conditions, eligibility and interpretation of the plans, ARWI\u2019s grievance should be resolved according to each plan\u2019s internal dispute mechanism. ARWI submitted that Article XI, Section One of the CBAs (\u201cthe arbitration clause\u201d) mandates that the grievance proceed to arbitration. The arbitration clause states, in pertinent part, that \u201c[a]ny question as to the interpretation of this Agreement, or as to any alleged violation of the terms of this Agreement, which is not otherwise settled to the mutual satisfaction of the parties hereto, shall at the request of either party be submitted to arbitration.\u201d (J.A. 344, 380.)</p>\n<p id=\"b631-12\">The district court held that the parties\u2019 dispute was arbitrable on account of the arbitration clause\u2019s wide breadth, the lack of any explicit language in the CBAs excluding ARWI\u2019s grievance from arbitration, and the absence of \u201cforceful evidence\u201d that the parties wished to exclude the disputes from arbitration. DuPont appeals the district court\u2019s judgment.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b631-13\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-14\">The question posed here is whether ARWI\u2019s grievance, alleging that the amendments to its employees\u2019 plans breached the parties\u2019 CBAs, is arbitrable. We review a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment de novo, viewing all of the facts in the light most favorable to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>non-movant. <em>See, e.g., EEOC v. Navy Fed. Credit Union, </em>424 F.3d 397, 405 (4th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b632-4\">Through a series of three cases, known as the \u201cSteelworker\u2019s Trilogy,\u201d the Supreme Court set out several principles to aid lower courts in determining whether an employer-union dispute is subject to arbitration. <em>See Steelworkers v. Warrior &amp; Gulf Navigation Co., </em>363 U.S. 574, 80 S.Ct. 1347, 4 L.Ed.2d 1409 (1960), <em>Steelworkers v. American Mfg. Co., </em>363 U.S. 564, 80 S.Ct. 1363, 4 L.Ed.2d 1432 (1960), and <em>Steelworkers v. Enterprise Wheel &amp; Car Corp., </em>363 U.S. 593, 80 S.Ct. 1358, 4 L.Ed.2d 1424 (1960).</p>\n<p id=\"b632-5\">The Supreme Court first emphasized that \u201carbitration is a matter of contract and a party cannot be required to submit to arbitration any dispute which he has not agreed so to submit.\u201d <em>Warrior &amp; Gulf Navigation Co., </em>363 U.S. at 582, 80 S.Ct. 1347. \u201cThe second rule, which follows inexorably from the first, is that the question of arbitrability \u2014 whether a collective-bargaining agreement creates a duty for the parties to arbitrate the particular grievance \u2014 is undeniably an issue for judicial determination.\u201d <em>AT &amp; T Tech., Inc. v. Commc\u2019ns Workers of Am., </em>475 U.S. 643, 649, 106 S.Ct. 1415, 89 L.Ed.2d 648 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b632-6\">Third, in reviewing whether the parties claims are arbitrable, \u201ca court is not to rule on the potential merits of the underlying claims.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 649, 106 S.Ct. 1415. This mandate applies \u201ceven if [the union\u2019s grievance] appears to the court to be frivolous,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 649-50, 106 S.Ct. 1415, as the court must limit its inquiry to whether the union\u2019s claims are arbitrable. Finally, \u201cthere is a presumption of arbitrability in the sense that an order to arbitrate the particular grievance should not be denied unless it may be said with <em>positive assurance </em>that the arbitration clause is not susceptible of an interpretation that covers the asserted dispute. Doubts should be resolved in favor of coverage.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 650, 106 S.Ct. 1415 (emphasis added). This \u201cpresumption is particularly applicable,\u201d <em>id., </em>where the arbitration clause is \u201cbroad.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Consequently, \u201c \u2018absen[t][ ] any express provision excluding a particular grievance from arbitration ... only the <em>most forceful evidence </em>of a purpose to exclude the claim from arbitration\u2019 \u201d will suffice. <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Warrior &amp; Gulf, </em>363 U.S. at 584-85, 80 S.Ct. 1347) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b632-8\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-9\">DuPont contends that the district court erred in three respects: (1) the district court failed to grasp that since ARWI\u2019s breach of contract grievance is inextricably linked with benefit eligibility determinations, it should be resolved under each plan\u2019s dispute resolution procedure; (2) the district court did not take into account dispositive language from Article VII of the CBAs limiting what disputes are subject to arbitration; and (3) the district court \u201cfailed to apply governing ERISA principles applicable to the resolution of employee benefit eligibility issues and other plan interpretation issues implicated by the grievance.\u201d (Appellant\u2019s Br. 13.)</p>\n<p id=\"b632-10\">The cornerstone of DuPont\u2019s argument is that the amendments concern the <em>eligibility </em>of claimants to receive benefits under the plans, and as such, they do not implicate the CBAs. Specifically, DuPont contends that in resolving the parties\u2019 dispute, an arbitrator would be forced to determine whether individuals affected by the amendments are eligible for benefits, a decision tasked solely to the plan administrator. Such an action would also be inconsistent with the CBAs, and specifically, Article VII, Sections 1 and 3, which states in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-11\">Section 1. All existing privileges heretofore enjoyed by the employees in accordance with the following Industrial Relations Plans and Practices of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>COMPANY and of the Plant shall continue, subject to the provisions of such Plans and Practices and to such rules, regulations and interpretations as existing prior to the signing of this Agreement, and to such modifications thereof, as may be hereafter adopted generally by the Company or by the Plant to govern such privileges.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b633-5\">Section 3. In addition to receiving benefits pursuant to the Plans and Practices set forth in Section 1 above, employees shall also receive benefits as provided by the COMPANY\u2019S Beneflex Flexible Benefits Plan, subject to all terms and conditions of said Plan....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b633-6\">(emphasis added). DuPont states that the \u201csubject to\u201d language in Article VII was included in the CBAs in order \u201cto ensure that [DuPont] retained] the flexibility to amend these plans without having to negotiate over subsequent plan amendments at particular unionized facilities.\u201d (Appellant\u2019s Br. 7.) By filing a grievance, DuPont argues that ARWI is attempting an \u201cend round\u201d the plans\u2019 dispute resolution procedures and Section 502(a)(1)(B) of ERISA, which provide the exclusive remedies for employees seeking, enforcing, or clarifying their benefits under the terms of each plan. Since the terms of each plan grant the plan administrator<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>, acting as an ERISA fiduciary, the sole right and discretion to make benefit eligibility determinations, and the resolution of ARWI\u2019s grievance necessarily involves eligibility determinations, DuPont concludes that ARWI must resolve its grievance through each plan\u2019s internal dispute procedures or in the alternative, through a civil action in federal court.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-7\">ARWI surmises that since its grievance is limited to \u201cwhether DuPont exceeded the external restraints imposed by the CBA ... when it amended the plans\u201d (Ap-pellee\u2019s Br. 13), the dispute clearly falls within the broad reach of the arbitration clause. In addition, parroting the district court\u2019s reasoning, ARWI states that the plans\u2019 internal dispute resolution mechanisms are designed to handle \u201croutine benefit eligibility determinations\u201d (Appellee\u2019s Br. 14) not for interpreting the obligations of each party under the CBAs. Finally, ARWI contends that arbitration is the only suitable forum to resolve the merits of its claim as ERISA does not provide employees with \u201ca mechanism\u201d to bring their grievances before a federal court.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-10\">Based on the guidance provided by the Supreme Court, there can be little doubt that ARWI\u2019s claims are arbitrable. Here, like in <em>AT &amp; T: </em>the CBAs contain a broad \u201cstandard arbitration clause,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 647, 106 S.Ct. 1415, that allows \u201cany question as to the interpretation of the [CBA] or as to any alleged violation of the [CBA]\u201d to be settled by arbitration, (emphasis added). Frankly, it is difficult to envision a broader arbitration clause. It is unfathomable that either of the parties could assume that the \u201csubject to\u201d language in Article VII would override the overarching arbitration clause in Article XI of the CBAs. This conclusion is even more convincing in light of the fact that the parties chose to explicitly exclude arbitration as a forum for resolving certain types of disputes. For example, the CBAs preclude an employee disputing his discharge (J.A. 334) or the denial of a promotion from proceeding to arbitration. (J.A. 336-337.) Initially, even DuPont felt ARWI\u2019s grievance was subject to arbitration, and it went so far as to agree on an arbitrator; yet, DuPont suddenly changed its mind, refusing to arbitrate and instead initiated this action in federal court.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>While it is true that the result of the plans\u2019 amendments will decrease the benefits available to certain DuPont employees, ARWI\u2019s breach of contract claims are premised on the fact that such changes <em>violate the terms of the CBAs. </em>As a result, DuPont\u2019s argument that the amendments affect an employee\u2019s eligibility to receive benefits under the plans, while true, is inapposite to the issue of what forum should determine whether the amendments violated the CBAs.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-4\">Additionally, DuPont has not provided \u201cforceful evidence,\u201d much less \u201cthe most forceful evidence,\u201d that the parties\u2019 intended to submit an employee\u2019s claims alleging violations of the CBAs to the plan administrator or to a federal court. The presumption of arbitrability is particularly strong in this case due to the wide reaching arbitration clause and the lack of any explicit language in the CBAs excluding the claims at issue here from arbitration. Whatever limited doubt exists as to the parties\u2019 intentions must be resolved in favor of arbitration. Also, sending this grievance to an arbitrator is hardly inconsistent with ERISA (despite DuPont\u2019s claims to the contrary), and quite frankly is the only option that conforms to the mandates of the Supreme Court. Because there is no doubt that the arbitration clause is susceptible to an interpretation that covers ARWI\u2019s grievance, arbitration is the proper forum to resolve this dispute.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b634-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-6\">For the reasons above, we affirm the district court\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-7\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b630-19\">. The Vacation Plan is not relevant to this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b631-6\">. For example, ARWI claims DuPont violated Article VII, Section 1 of the CBAs which provides that \"any changes in the [benefit plans], which had the effect of reducing or terminating benefits will not be made effective until one year (1) after notice to the Union by the Company of such changes.\u201d (J.A. 332.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b631-7\">.

Shortly after the district court's decision, three other district courts decided the same issue. Relying on reasoning similar to that of the district court in this case, the three district courts held that the unions\u2019 claims were subject to arbitration. <em>See United Steel, Paper and Forestry, Rubber, Mfg., Energy, Allied Indus. and Serv.
