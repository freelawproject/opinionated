Sept. 27, 2007). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-6\">In reviewing the BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to reopen, we remain mindful of the Supreme Court\u2019s admonition that motions to reopen are \u201cdisfavored.\u201d <em>See Ma-ghradze v. Gonzales, </em>462 F.3d 150, 154 (2d Cir.2006) (citing <em>INS v. Abudu, </em>485 U.S. 94, 107, 108 S.Ct. 904, 99 L.Ed.2d 90 (1988)). When the agency denies a motion to reopen, this Court reviews the agency\u2019s decision for an abuse of discretion. <em>See Kaur v. BIA, </em>413 F.3d 232, 233 (2d Cir. 2005). \u201cAn abuse of discretion may be found ... where the [BIA\u2019s] decision provides no rational explanation, inexplicably departs from established policies, is devoid of any reasoning, or contains only summary or conclusory statements; that is to say, where the Board has acted in an arbitrary or capricious manner.\u201d <em>Ke Zhen Zhao v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>265 F.3d 83, 93 (2d Cir.2001) (internal citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b401-7\">A motion to reopen must be filed no later than 90 days after the date of the agency\u2019s final decision. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(2). It is undisputed that Liu\u2019s July 2007 motion to reopen was untimely. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(2). However, the 90-day filing deadline does not apply to a motion to reopen that is \u201cbased on changed country conditions arising in the country of nationality or the country to which removal has been ordered, if such evidence is material and was not available and would not have been discovered or presented at the previous proceeding.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(C)(ii); <em>see </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(3)(ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b401-8\">We find no abuse of discretion in the BIA\u2019s finding that Liu failed to establish materially changed country conditions excusing the untimeliness of his motion. See 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(C)(ii); <em>Kaur, </em>413 F.3d at 233. As a threshold matter, we leave undisturbed the BIA\u2019s finding that to establish a \u201cmaterial\u201d change, Liu was required to present evidence specifically addressing the Chinese government\u2019s treatment of Chinese Democratic Party members returning from the United States to China, rather than of political dissidents generally. Because Liu does not challenge that finding in his brief, we deem any such challenge waived. <em>See Yueqing Zhang v. Gonzales, </em>426 F.3d 540, 546 n. 7 (2d Cir.2005) (emphasizing that issues not sufficiently argued in the briefs are considered waived and ordinarily will not be addressed on appeal).</p>\n<p id=\"b401-9\">Moreover, we find unavailing Liu\u2019s argument that he established changed country conditions In support his argument, Liu cites to two criminal judgments against individuals accused of organizing against the government as members of the CDP. However, because the criminal judgments do not discuss individuals who, like Liu, agitated against the Chinese government only while in the United States, the BIA did not abuse its discretion in finding them insufficient to establish a material change in country conditions. <em>See 8 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(C)(ii); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(3)(ii). Liu also cited to a news article reporting that Chinese Democratic Party members in New York were calling for the release of a member who was arrested when she returned to China. However, the BIA did not abuse its discretion insofar as it concluded that, in the absence of other supporting evidence, the article alone was insufficient to establish materially changed country conditions. <em>See Xiao Ji Chen v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>471 F.3d 315, 341-42 (2d Cir.2006) (empha<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>sizing that the weight afforded to documentary evidence \u201clies largely within the discretion of the IJ\u201d) (internal quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b402-4\">The BIA thus appropriately considered and rejected the only evidence that Liu raised in support of his changed country conditions claim.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Because the BIA\u2019s changed country conditions finding was a dispositive basis for its denial of Liu\u2019s motion to reopen, we deny the petition for review. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b402-5\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. As we have completed our review, the pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot. The pending request for oral argument in this petition is DENIED in accordance with Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 34(a)(2), and Second Circuit Local Rule 34(b).</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b402-14\">. We find unavailing Liu\u2019s argument that the BIA failed to \"fully review the record,\" given that the BIA explicitly considered several documents Liu submitted and he failed to point to any particular evidence which the BIA ignored. <em>See Xiao Ji Chen, </em>471 F.3d at 336 n. 17 (emphasizing that, where the agency has given reasoned consideration to the petition and made adequate findings, it is not required to address specifically each claim the petitioner made or each piece of evidence the petitioner presented).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
