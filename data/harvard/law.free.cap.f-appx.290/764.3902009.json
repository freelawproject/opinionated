The district court held alternatively that Whitehurst\u2019s complaint was time barred under the Texas limitations period applicable in a \u00a7 1983 suit, or that the individual defendants were entitled to immunity because they were not responsible for the miscalculations that harmed Whitehurst. The latter proposition is incontestable. The former proposition is supported at Rec 11:303 where a letter Whitehurst wrote in 2003 acknowledged that he knew as early as 1997 that the State had failed to credit the time served. We need not reach any potential <em>Heck v. Humphrey, </em>512 U.S. 477, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994) bar to this suit, and Whitehurst\u2019s other contentions lack merit. We find no reversible error in the court\u2019s opinions and AFFIRM the judgment of dismissal.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b786-35\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
