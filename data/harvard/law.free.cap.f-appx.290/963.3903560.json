Upon de novo review, we agree with the district court that the USDA\u2019s decision was not arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise inconsistent with the law. <em>See Voyageurs Nat\u2019l Park Ass\u2019n v. Norton, </em>381 F.3d 759, 763 (8th Cir.2004) (appellate standard of review and applicable legal standard under APA). Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is affirmed. <em>See </em>8th Cir. R. 47B.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b985-31\">. The Honorable Joseph F.
