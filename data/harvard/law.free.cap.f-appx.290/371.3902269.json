Kurniawan claims that the harassment will continue if he returns to Indonesia.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-25\">In order to qualify for withholding of removal, \u201can alien must show, by a clear probability, that [he] will be persecuted based on a protected ground if [he] is returned to [his] native country.\u201d <em>Ly v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number><em>Mukasey, </em>524 F.3d 126, 132 (1st Cir.2008). The applicant must also show that the persecution is \u201cthe direct result of government action, government-supported action, or government\u2019s unwillingness or inability to control private conduct.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Kho v. Keisler, </em>505 F.3d 50, 55 (1st Cir.2007)). A showing of past persecution gives rise to a rebuttable presumption of future persecution. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.16(b)(l)(i); <em>Ruiz v. Mukasey, </em>526 F.3d 31, 35 (1st Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b394-4\">Before the Immigration Judge (IJ), the petitioner testified that he converted from Islam to Christianity in 1984. Since that conversion, he and his wife have received threats from his parents and his father\u2019s family. These family members threatened to take his children away from him and his wife if he did not revert to Islam and raise his sons as Muslims. Although the IJ acknowledged that \u201charassment from one\u2019s family is ugly, discriminatory, and regrettable,\u201d the IJ concluded that he could not \u201cfind the harassment of the quality and degree experienced by the petitioners\u201d supported a finding of persecution. This finding deprived the petitioner of a rebut-table presumption of future persecution. <em>Ruiz, </em>526 F.3d at 35.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-5\">As the IJ properly noted, \u201c[a]n applicant who has not suffered past persecution may demonstrate that his life or freedom would be threatened in a country on account of a protected ground\u201d and thereby qualify for withholding of removal.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.16(b)(2). However, the IJ explained that the petitioner had failed to make such a showing. The petitioner provided no evidence of anyone outside of his family engaging in harassing or threatening behavior. The IJ further found that \u201cthere is no evidence that the government of Indonesia tolerates the discrimination [against Christians] in that country such as to be found as government directed or condoned so as to be tantamount to persecution.\u201d In support of this conclusion, the IJ cited the 2005 Country Report on Human Rights Practices in Indonesia, which refers to occasional incidences of violence against Christians, but does not indicate that the government either condones the religiously motivated violence or is unable to control it.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-9\">The BIA affirmed the IJ\u2019s decision, adopting its factual findings.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In seeking review, the petitioner challenges only the IJ\u2019s and BIA\u2019s conclusion that he fails to meet his burden of proving that it is more likely than not that he would be persecuted if he returns to Indonesia. He argues that the persecution he suffered in Indonesia, in conjunction with the 2005 Country Report on Human Rights Practices in Indonesia, constitutes evidence sufficient to satisfy his burden. However, nothing in the record or in his woefully inadequate brief compels a contrary finding. <em>Jamal v. Mukasey, </em>531 F.3d 60, 66 (1st Cir.2008) (explaining that a petitioner \u201cmust demonstrate the evidence in the record not only supports a contrary conclusion but compels it\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b395-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>Therefore, we <em>deny </em>the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-5\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b393-16\">. His given name is Rifai Andreas Tumangka; however, he has adopted the name Heru Kur-niawan in the United States. Kurniawan\u2019s wife, Patty Diane Deetje, and their adult sons, Defri Steven and Welson Agustinus, filed derivative applications for relief from deportation based on Kurniawan\u2019s application. Their claims rest on Kurniawan\u2019s and we therefore do not independently address them.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b393-26\"><em>. </em>Petitioner also seeks review of the BIA\u2019s denial of his petition for relief under the United Nations Convention Against Torture. However, he waived this claim by failing to meaningfully raise it before the BIA. <em>Molina De Massenet v. Gonzales, </em>485 F.3d 661, 664 (1st Cir.2007) (explaining that arguments not raised before the BIA are waived due to a failure to exhaust administrative remedies).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b394-6\">. The IJ rejected the petitioner\u2019s application for asylum because the application was filed after the one-year filing deadline. The IJ found that the petitioner did not raise any extraordinary or changed circumstances that would justify ignoring the requirement that aliens file an asylum application within one year of arriving in the United States. <em>Jorgji v. Mukasey, </em>514 F.3d 53, 55 (1st Cir.2008). The petitioner does not challenge that determination on appeal. In any event, we would not have the jurisdiction to entertain such a challenge. <em>Ly, </em>524 F.3d at 130.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b394-11\">. We review both the IJ\u2019s and BIA\u2019s decisions when the BIA adopts and affirms the IJ's decision and adds its own analysis. <em>Ly, </em>524 F.3d at 130.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
