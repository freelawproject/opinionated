On appeal, his attorney has filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), stating that there are no meritorious issues for review but questioning the reasonableness of the sentence imposed. Bennett was advised of his right to file a pro se supplemental brief, but has not done so. After a thorough review of the record, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-10\">We will affirm a sentence imposed following revocation of supervised release if it is within the applicable statutory limits and not plainly unreasonable. <em>United States v. Crudup, </em>461 F.3d 433, 437, 439-40 (4th Cir.2006), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 1813, 167 L.Ed.2d 325 (2007); <em>see also United States v. Finley, </em>531 F.3d 288, 294 (4th Cir.2008). Bennett\u2019s sentence is below the statutorily authorized maximum sentence of two years, <em>see </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e)(3) (2000), and falls below the advisory guideline range of twenty-four to thirty months\u2019 imprisonment. <em>See U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7\u00a7 7B1.4 (a) (p.s.), 7B1.4 (b)(3)(A) (2007). Finally, the district court adequately considered the applicable 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3553(a) (West 2000 &amp; Supp. 2008) factors when imposing sentence. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e). We conclude that the sentence is not plainly unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-14\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the entire record for meritorious issues and have found none. Accordingly, we affirm the revocation of Bennett\u2019s supervised release and his sentence. This court requires counsel to inform Bennett in writing of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. Accordingly, we also deny counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw as counsel. If Bennett requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may renew his motion for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on Bennett. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-15\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
