For the reasons set forth below, we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-24\">We will uphold an adverse credibility determination if it is supported by substantial evidence, <em>see Tewabe v. Gonzales, </em>446 F.3d 533, 538 (4th Cir.2006), and reverse the Board\u2019s decision \u201conly if the evidence presented ... was so compelling that no reasonable factfinder could fail to find the requisite fear of persecution.\u201d <em>Rusu v. INS, </em>296 F.3d 316, 325 n. 14 (4th Cir.2002) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b637-25\">Having reviewed the administrative record and the Board\u2019s decision, we find that substantial evidence supports the immigration judge\u2019s adverse credibility finding, as affirmed by the Board, and the ruling that Ali Mbodou failed to establish past persecution or a well-founded fear of future persecution as necessary to establish eligibility for asylum. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(1)(B)\u00ae, (ii) (2006) (providing that the burden of proof is on the alien to establish eligibility for asylum); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.13(a) (2008) (same). Because the record does not compel a different result, we will not disturb the Board\u2019s denial of Ali Mbodou\u2019s application for asylum. Moreover, as Ali Mbodou cannot sustain his burden on the asylum claim, he cannot <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>establish his entitlement to withholding of removal. <em>Camara v. Ashcroft, </em>378 F.3d 361, 367 (4th Cir.2004) (\u201cBecause the burden of proof for withholding of removal is higher than for asylum \u2014 even though the facts that must be proved are the same\u2014 an applicant who is ineligible for asylum is necessarily ineligible for withholding of removal.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b638-4\">Accordingly, we deny the petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-5\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b637-19\"> Because Ali Mbodou did not challenge the denial of relief under the CAT in his brief, the claim is not preserved for review. <em>See Edwards v. City of Goldsboro, </em>178 F.3d 231, 241 n. 6 (4th Cir. 1999).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
