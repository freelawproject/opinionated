HARTZ, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b165-8\">Walter Harvey, a federal prisoner appearing pro se, appeals the dismissal by the United States District Court for the District of Kansas of his application for relief under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241. Exercising jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-9\">I. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b165-10\">In 1983 Mr. Harvey was tried in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Missouri, and convicted of kidnapping, transportation of a stolen vehicle across state lines, interstate transportation of a female for immoral purposes, and unlawful use of a firearm. <em>See United States v. Harvey, </em>756 F.2d 636 (8th Cir. 1985). He was sentenced to 120 years\u2019 imprisonment. While serving his federal sentence, he was sentenced to death in Missouri state court for committing a murder. Under the authority of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4082 (1973) (authorizing U.S. Attorney General to designate the place of confinement where a sentence imposed by a federal court shall be served), the U.S. Bureau of Prisons (BOP) transferred him to the Missouri Department of Corrections (MODOC) for concurrent service of his state and federal sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-11\">In 1985 Mr. Harvey filed in the United States District Court for the Western District of Missouri an application for habeas relief under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241, challenging his transfer to the MODOC. <em>See Harvey v. United States, </em>615 F.Supp. 1046 (WD.Mo.1985). The court denied relief, stating that \u201cit is obvious that the [MO-DOC] has been appropriately designated pursuant to the authority conferred by Section 4082 as the place of confinement where petitioner\u2019s federal sentence shall be served.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1048.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-14\">While the \u00a7 2241 application was pending, the Missouri Supreme Court reversed Mr. Harvey\u2019s death sentence and remanded the case for retrial. On August 2, 1985, the BOP issued a federal detainer for Mr. Harvey\u2019s return to federal custody upon completion of his Missouri sentence. Ultimately, however, Mr. Harvey was again convicted and sentenced to life in prison. It also appears that in 1989 he was convicted in Illinois state court on charges of murder and rape.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-15\">During his incarceration in state prison, Mr. Harvey was advised of the reason for his placement in the custody of the MO-DOC. By letter dated December 13, 1999, the BOP informed him:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-16\">This is in response to your recent correspondence to this office. Your federal sentence commenced on June 10, 1983. On March 8, 1985, the federal government relinquished primary jurisdiction to the state of Missouri. The Bureau of Prisons (Bureau) designated the Missouri Department of Corrections (MO-DOC), as the designated institution for service of your federal sentence, thereby making it operate concurrently with your Missouri sentence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>The federal government has a vested interest in your continued incarceration until you have met your obligation in regards to your federal sentence. If you parole from your Missouri state sentence prior to being granted release from your federal sentence, the U.S. Marshals Service will assume custody of you, and a federal institution will be designated for service of the remainder of your federal sentence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b166-4\">R. Doc. 6, Attach. A, Ex. 4. When Mr. Harvey was paroled by Missouri on March 24, 2004, he was returned to the custody of the BOP to serve the remainder of his federal sentence. He has been incarcerated at the federal penitentiary in Leavenworth, Kansas.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-5\">On March 9, 2005, Mr. Harvey filed the present application for relief under \u00a7 2241. The district court construed the application as presenting two principal contentions: (1) that \u201chis present federal confinement is unlawful because BOP relinquished all custody and jurisdiction over him when they transferred him to Missouri in 1984,\u201d R. Doc. 14 at 3; and (2) that his confinement by the BOP is unlawful \u201cbecause federal authorities failed to take any action to assert jurisdiction and custody over him throughout his extradition between Missouri and Illinois,\u201d <em>id. </em>The court denied Mr. Harvey\u2019s application on the ground that \u201cthe record clearly established] [Mr. Harvey\u2019s] continuous service of his federal sentence throughout his extensive criminal litigation in Missouri and Illinois,\u201d <em>id., </em>and that the Western District of Missouri had \u201cpreviously determined that [his] transfer to the State of Missouri for continued service of [his] federal sentence was lawful and in full compliance with 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4082,\u201d <em>id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b166-6\">On appeal Mr. Harvey repeats his claims. He contends that (1) his federal confinement is unlawful because the BOP \u201chad permanently relinquished custody\u201d over him, Aplt. Br. at 6, when it transferred him to the custody of the State of Missouri and failed to intervene after he had been transferred from Missouri to Illinois and then back to Missouri; and (2) he has been serving his federal sentence \u201cin a piece-meal fashion and or in installments,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 16. He requests immediate release from BOP custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-8\">We review de novo a district court\u2019s denial of relief under \u00a7 2241. <em>Bradshaw v. Story, </em>86 F.3d 164, 166 (10th Cir.1996). Because Mr. Harvey is representing himself on appeal, we construe his pleadings liberally. <em>Haines v. Kerner, </em>404 U.S. 519, 520-21, 92 S.Ct. 594, 30 L.Ed.2d 652 (1972) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b166-9\">Mr. Harvey\u2019s claim that BOP \u201crelinquished custody\u201d when it transferred him to Missouri custody is without merit. As we have explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-10\">Under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3621(b), the Bureau of Prisons, exercising the same discretion previously vested in the Attorney General under repealed provisions of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4082, may direct confinement in any available facility and may transfer a prisoner from one facility to another any time. Moreover, state and federal prisoners generally enjoy no constitutional right to placement in any particular penal institution.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b166-11\"><em>Prows v. Fed. Bureau of Prisons, </em>981 F.2d 466, 469 n. 3 (10th Cir.1992). Thus, the BOP did not abandon custody over Mr. Harvey when it transferred him to the MODOC for service of his federal sentence, and he cannot challenge that decision. <em>See United States v. McCrary, </em>220 F.3d 868, 870-71 (8th Cir.2000) (federal prisoner generally has no standing to challenge the BOP\u2019s decision to transfer him to state custody for concurrent service of federal and state sentences).</p>\n<p id=\"b167-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>We also reject Mr. Harvey\u2019s claim that he has been serving his federal sentence in a piecemeal fashion. The BOP informed him that it retained custody over him and that the MODOC had been designated as the place of confinement for concurrent service of his sentences. He has received credit on his federal sentence for all time served in state custody since his federal sentence was imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-5\">Mr. Harvey raises on appeal several issues that he did not present to the district court, such as the alleged denial of his rights under the Interstate Agreement on Detainers Act. We decline to address them. <em>See King v. United States, </em>301 F.3d 1270, 1274 (10th Cir.2002) (As a general rule, \u201cthis court will not consider an issue on appeal that was not raised below.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b167-6\">II. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b167-7\">We AFFIRM the district court\u2019s dismissal of Mr. Harvey\u2019s \u00a7 2241 application and DENY his \u201cMotions to Issue Writ of Habeas Corpus.\u201d</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b165-12\"> After examining the briefs and appellate record, this panel has determined unanimously that oral argument would not materially assist the determination of this appeal. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument. This order and judgment is not binding precedent except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed. R.App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
