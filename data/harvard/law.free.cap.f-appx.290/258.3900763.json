On appeal, Grissom argues that his sentence was unreasonable because the district court: (1) did not properly consider the factors in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), specifically \u00a7 3553(a)(1), the nature of the offense and his history and personal characteristics; and (2) did not consider the disparities in the Guidelines\u2019 treatment of crimes involving crack cocaine as opposed to cocaine powder. After thorough review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-6\">We review the ultimate sentence imposed by a district court for \u201creasonableness,\u201d which \u201cmerely asks whether the trial court abused its discretion.\u201d <em>United States v. Pugh, </em>515 F.3d 1179, 1189 (11th Cir.2008) (quoting <em>Rita v. United States, </em>- U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2465, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007)).</p>\n<p id=\"b281-9\">Our reasonableness review consists of two steps. <em>Pugh, </em>515 F.3d at 1190. First, we must \u201c \u2018ensure that the district court committed no significant procedural error, such as failing to calculate (or improperly calculating) the Guidelines range, treating the Guidelines as mandatory, failing to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, selecting a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts, or failing to adequately explain the chosen sentence \u2014 including an explanation for any deviation from the Guidelines range.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Gall v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007)).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> If we conclude that the district court did not proeedurally err, we must consider the \u201c \u2018substantive reasonableness of the sentence imposed, under an abuse-of-discretion standard,\u2019 \u201d based on the \u201c \u2018totality of the circumstances.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Gall, </em>128 S.Ct. at 597). \u201cThe party who challenges the sentence bears the burden of establishing that the sentence is unreasonable in the light of both th[e] record and the factors in section 3553(a).\u201d <em>United States v. Thomas, </em>446 F.3d 1348, 1351 (11th Cir.2006) (internal quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b281-12\">We are unpersuaded by Grissom\u2019s argument that the district court proeedurally erred in failing to properly consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. At sentencing, the court stated that it had \u201clistened to the defendant and defendant\u2019s counsel ... reviewed the presentence investigation report ... and considered the factors set forth in [\u00a7 3553(a) ].\u201d The record thus reflects the district court\u2019s adequate consideration of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. Indeed, \u201cthe district court need only acknowledge that it considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, and need not discuss each of these factors in either the sentencing hearing or in the sentencing order.\u201d <em>United States v. Amedeo, </em>487 F.3d 823, 833 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 671, 169 L.Ed.2d 526 (2007) (internal quotation and punctuation omitted); <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 786 (11th Cir.2005) (stating that \u201can acknowledgment by the district coui\u2019t that it has considered the defendant\u2019s arguments and the factors in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>section 3553(a) is sufficient under <em>Booker\u201d); United States v. Scott, </em>426 F.3d 1324, 1329 (11th Cir.2005) (\u201cnothing in <em>Booker </em>or elsewhere requires the district court to state on the record that it has explicitly considered each of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors or to discuss each of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b282-4\">We likewise reject Grissom\u2019s argument that his sentence is unreasonable in light of <em>Kimbrough v. U.S., </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 558, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007). In <em>Kimbrough, </em>the Supreme Court recognized that the Guidelines recommend harsher sentences for conduct involving crack cocaine than for conduct involving powder cocaine, and held that, given the advisory nature of the Guidelines, a district court <em>may </em>consider this disparity when determining an appropriate sentence. <em>Id. </em>at 575-76. Here, however, Grissom pled guilty to possession of a quantity of cocaine base, a charge which specifies neither the amount nor type of cocaine he possessed. Further, his offense level was based on his status as a career offender, which similarly does not distinguish between crack and powder cocaine. Thus, the range suggested by the Guidelines\u2014 and adopted by the district court \u2014 was not the result of the disparity discussed in <em>Kimbrough. </em>In addition, although <em>Kimbrough </em>allows a district court to deviate from the Guidelines\u2019 recommendation because of policy concerns, it does not mandate such deviation, nor does <em>Kimbrough </em>change the standard of review on appeal. <em>See id. </em>at 576.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-7\">In short, Grissom\u2019s within-Guidelines sentence is neither procedurally nor substantively unreasonable, and the district court did not abuse its discretion in imposing it.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b282-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b281-10\">. The \u00a7 3553(a) factors include: (1) the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant; (2) the need for the sentence imposed to reflect the seriousness of the offense, to promote respect for the law, and to provide just punishment for the offense; (3) the need for the sentence imposed to afford adequate deterrence; (4) the need to protect the public; (5) the need to provide the defendant with educational or vocational training or medical care; (6) the kinds of sentences available; (7) the Sentencing Guidelines range; (8) the pertinent policy statements of the Sentencing Commission; (9) the need to avoid unwanted sentencing disparities; and (10) the need to provide restitution to victims. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b282-8\">. <em>See Rita, </em>127 S.Ct. at 2462 (holding that a court of appeals may afford a presumption of reasonableness to a within-Guidelines sentence); <em>United States v. Campbell, </em>491 F.3d 1306, 1314 n. 8 (11th Cir.2007) (noting that, although we have not normally afforded a within-Guidelines sentence a presumption of reasonableness, the <em>Rita </em>decision calls that policy into question).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
