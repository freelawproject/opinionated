Nicholson contends the district court clearly erred in reaching this finding. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-21\">Section 4245 provides for the hospitalization of an imprisoned person suffering from mental disease or defect. The district court properly grants a \u00a7 4245 motion if the government proves by a preponderance of the evidence that the inmate currently suffers from a mental disease or defect requiring \u201ccustody for care or treatment in a suitable facility.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4245(a), (d); <em>see United States v. Baker, </em>45 F.3d 837, 840 (4th Cir.1995). The district court\u2019s determination of this issue is one of fact, which is reviewed by the appellate court under a clearly erroneous standard. <em>See United States v. Bean, </em>373 F.3d 877, 879 (8th Cir.2004). A finding is clearly erroneous when \u201c\u2018the reviewing court on the entire evidence is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\u2019\u201d <em>United States v. Dugger, </em>485 F.3d 236, 239 (4th Cir.2007) (quoting <em>United States v. U.S. Gypsum Co., </em>333 U.S. 364, 395, 68 S.Ct. 525, 92 L.Ed. 746 (1948)).</p>\n<p id=\"b639-22\">In making its assessment, the district court relied on the written evaluation of staff at FCI Butner, an independent psychiatrist\u2019s written evaluation, and the live testimony of a Butner psychiatrist. The unanimous conclusion of the experts was that Nicholson suffered from a mental disease or defect for which he required treatment at a suitable facility. Nicholson presented no evidence to the contrary. We therefore have no difficulty concluding that the district court did not clearly err when it found Nicholson needed to be placed in a suitable facility for treatment of his mental illness under \u00a7 4245.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-23\">We affirm the district court\u2019s order. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-4\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
