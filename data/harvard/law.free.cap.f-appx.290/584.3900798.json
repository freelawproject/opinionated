The district court sentenced Ellerbe to twenty-eight months imprisonment and ordered him to pay $70,798.94 in restitution, payable in monthly payments of $1200, beginning upon his release from prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-11\">Ellerbe appeals, claiming that the district court failed to adequately consider his ability to pay when it determined the restitution payment schedule, as required by 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3664(f)(2) (2000). Because he did not object at sentencing, Ellerbe\u2019s claim is reviewed for plain error. <em>See United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 732-34, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993); <em>United States v. Hughes, </em>401 F.3d 540, 547 (4th Cir.2005). Because the record establishes that the district court adequately considered the factors as required under \u00a7 3664(f)(2), we conclude that Ellerbe cannot show error, let alone plain error, in the district court\u2019s restitution order. <em>See United States v. Karam, </em>201 F.3d 320, 330 (4th Cir.2000) (district court\u2019s adoption of presentence report that contained sufficient facts to support restitution order avoided plain error). Accordingly, we affirm. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately addressed in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-13\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
