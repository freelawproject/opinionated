We dismiss in part, and grant and remand in part.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b94-14\">We review the adverse credibility determination for substantial evidence. <em>Garrovillas v. INS, </em>156 F.3d 1010, 1013 (9th Cir.1998). Although this standard is \u201c \u2018extremely deferential,\u2019 \u201d <em>Singh-Kaur v. INS, </em>183 F.3d 1147, 1149 (9th Cir.1999) (quoting <em>Ghaly v. INS, </em>58 F.3d 1425, 1431 (9th Cir.1995)), we do \u201cnot accept blindly an IJ\u2019s conclusion that a petitioner is not credible. Rather, we examine the record to see whether substantial evidence supports that conclusion, and determine whether the reasoning employed by the IJ is fatally flawed.\u201d <em>Aguilera-Cota v. INS, </em>914 F.2d 1375, 1381 (9th Cir.1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b94-15\">In arriving at its adverse credibility determination, the agency relied on three principal inconsistencies in the Petitioners\u2019 case regarding: (1) the frequency and perpetrators of attack(s) on Georgi; (2) the reason why Karapetian was forced to resign from her teaching job; and (3) Karapetian\u2019s father\u2019s failure to corroborate Karapetian\u2019s testimony regarding the burning of her apartment. A close review of the record reveals that none is supported by substantial evidence. The first relies on inconsistencies that are nonexistent or so \u201c[mjinor\u201d as to \u201creveal nothing about [Karapetian\u2019s] fear for [her and her son\u2019s] safety.\u201d <em>Vilorio-Lopez v. INS, </em>852 F.2d 1137, 1142 (9th Cir.1988). The record is clear that while at times Karapetian failed to distinguish between physical and verbal attacks, when asked to do so, she explained clearly that her son was physically attacked only once although he was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>abused in other ways on numerous occasions.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-5\">Karapetian was not given an opportunity to respond to the second and third alleged inconsistencies. <em>See, e.g., Mendoza Manimbao v. Ashcroft, </em>329 F.3d 655, 661 (9th Cir.2003) (requiring that a petitioner be \u201cafforded ... an opportunity to respond to the bases for attack on his credibility\u201d). Even if she had been given such an opportunity, we would find the agency\u2019s determination lacking. With respect to the reason for her forced resignation, Karapetian reasonably inferred the reason for her discharge and did not allege that she was expressly advised of the reason. With respect to Karapetian\u2019s father\u2019s failure to mention the apartment fire, that omission is insufficient to conclude that the fire did not occur given undisputed testimony that Karapetian did not tell her ailing and elderly father of all the abuse that she suffered, in order not to upset him. Also, Karapetian\u2019s father did refer to people \u201cattacking\u201d her home, and stated that, as a result, she had to \u201crun away\u201d from it. Although government counsel now suggests that the son\u2019s testimony also indicates that the fire did not occur, the IJ did not regard the son\u2019s testimony as contradictory, and in fact it was not.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-6\">Where, as here, \u201ceach of the IJ\u2019s or BIA\u2019s proffered reasons for an adverse credibility finding fails, we must accept a petitioner\u2019s testimony as credible.\u201d <em>See Kaur v. Ashcroft, </em>379 F.3d 876, 890 (9th Cir.2004). Neither the IJ nor BIA determined whether the Petitioners\u2019 testimony, if credible, established their eligibility for asylum, withholding of removal, and CAT relief. Accordingly, we remand this case for the agency to make an eligibility determination in the first instance. <em>See Singh v. Gonzales, </em>403 F.3d 1081, 1092-93 (9th Cir .2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b95-7\">DISMISSED in part, GRANTED and REMANDED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b94-11\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir. R. 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b94-12\">. We lack jurisdiction to review the Petitioners\u2019 untimely appeal of the denial of their motion to reopen. <em>See Haroutunian v. INS, </em>87 F.3d 374, 375 (9th Cir. 1996) (\u201d[T]he requirement of a timely petition for review is mandatory and jurisdictional.\u201d). We therefore dismiss that portion of the petition for review.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
