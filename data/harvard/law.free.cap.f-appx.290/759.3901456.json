We AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-10\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-11\">Williams worked as a waitress at Barn-hill\u2019s Buffet, Inc. (\u201cBarnhill\u2019s\u201d) in Hatties-burg, Mississippi from June 2004, until January 2005. Williams alleges that her immediate supervisor, Assistant Manager Randy Taylor, made unwelcome sexual comments and advances during her tenure at Barnhill\u2019s. The first incident took place in July 2004, when Williams and Taylor were in the back storage room of the restaurant. In Williams\u2019s words, Taylor \u201cgrabbed me by my apron, closed his eyes, and stuck his tongue down my mouth.\u201d Williams states that she fled the storage room in tears.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-16\">A few weeks later, Taylor allegedly grabbed Williams and pulled her head toward his lap, saying \u201cI can tell by your lips that you do that well.\u201d Williams told two other servers about the incident, but did not report Taylor\u2019s conduct to any manager or corporate representative of the company.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-17\">In August 2004, Williams attended an orientation and sexual harassment workshop conducted by Barnhill\u2019s corporate representatives. The training included an educational video about sexual harassment in the workplace. At the close of the session, Williams signed a form acknowledging that she had read the anti-harassment policy and understood that sexual harassment was to be reported to a manager or corporate representative. Though she had the opportunity to meet personally with corporate representatives that were on site for the training, Williams did not inform them of Taylor\u2019s previous harassment.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-18\">By mid-August, Williams states that Taylor began to retaliate against her for rejecting his advances. Williams avers that Taylor would routinely assign her to \u201cthe bad sections\u201d of the restaurant where she would earn less in tips. She also claims that she was the only waitress Taylor required to wash the wall where servers dumped food.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"761\">*761</page-number>On January 20, 2005, Williams went into Taylor\u2019s office to pick up her check. According to Williams, Taylor turned off the restaurant\u2019s security camera and locked the door. He attempted to kiss her, tried to force his legs between hers, and tried to unbutton her pants.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-5\">After this incident, Williams \u201cdecided to get [ ] another job and just leave it alone.\u201d She met with Barnhill\u2019s general manager, Von Nelson, and resigned. When asked why she had decided to leave, Williams recounted Taylor\u2019s behavior. Barnhill\u2019s immediately placed Taylor on suspension and questioned potential witnesses. Barn-hill\u2019s also reviewed the footage from the restaurant\u2019s security camera, which corroborated Williams\u2019s story. On February 2, 2005, Barnhill\u2019s terminated Taylor for misconduct involving the company\u2019s anti-harassment and security policies.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-6\">In February 2005, Williams filed a charge of sex discrimination, retaliation, and harassment with the EEOC. She subsequently filed suit under Title VII against Barnhill\u2019s and Randy Taylor. Taylor was dismissed from the suit on August 1, 2007. The district court granted Barnhill\u2019s motion for summary judgment on January 8, 2008, 2008 WL 111292. Williams appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-8\">We review a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment de novo. <em>LeMaire v. La. Dep\u2019t of Transp. and Dev., </em>480 F.3d 383, 386 (5th Cir.2007). Summary judgment is appropriate when, after considering the pleadings, discovery and disclosure on file, along with any affidavits, there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Fed.R.CivP. 56(c). A genuine issue of material fact exists if the summary judgment evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the non-movant. <em>Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., </em>477 U.S. 242, 248, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 2510, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986). All facts and evidence must be taken in the light most favorable to the non-movant. <em>LeMaire, </em>480 F.3d at 387.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-10\">In evaluating a claim of sexual harassment under Title VII, courts must first determine whether the complaining employee has suffered a \u201ctangible employment action.\u201d <em>See Casiano v. AT&amp;T Corp., </em>213 F.3d 278, 283 (5th Cir.2000). If she has, her suit is classified as a \u201cquid pro quo\u201d case; if she has not, her suit is classified as a \u201chostile environment\u201d case. <em>Id. </em>This distinction makes a difference. An employer that is held vicariously liable for \u201cquid pro quo\u201d harassment is not permitted to advance the affirmative defense enunciated by the Supreme Court in <em>Burlington Industries, Inc. v. Ellerth, </em>524 U.S. 742, 118 S.Ct. 2257, 141 L.Ed.2d 633 (1998) and <em>Faragher v. City of Boca Raton, </em>524 U.S. 775, 118 S.Ct. 2275, 141 L.Ed.2d 662 (1998). <em>Casiano, </em>213 F.3d at 283-84. In contrast, an employer that is found to have maintained a \u201chostile work environment\u201d may assert the <em>Ellerth/Faragher </em>affirmative defense. <em>Id. </em>at 284.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-11\">The district court determined that Williams had not suffered a \u201ctangible employment action,\u201d and thus could not advance a quid pro quo claim. Analyzing her claim as one of hostile work environment, the court determined that Barnhill\u2019s had satisfied the elements of the <em>Ellerth/Far-agher </em>affirmative defense and granted summary judgment on this basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-12\">A. Tangible Employment Action</p>\n<p id=\"b783-13\">Williams first challenges the district court\u2019s finding that she did not suffer a \u201ctangible employment action.\u201d Williams asserts that Taylor\u2019s retaliation, which consisted of assigning her to \u201cthe bad sections\u201d of the restaurant and requiring her to wash the wall where servers dumped food, amounted to a tangible employment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"762\">*762</page-number>action. We disagree. The Supreme Court has defined a \u201ctangible employment action\u201d as \u201ca significant change in employment status such as hiring, firing, failing to promote, reassignment with significantly different responsibilities, or a decision causing a significant change in benefits.\u201d <em>Ellerth, </em>524 U.S. at 761, 118 S.Ct. at 2268. An employee does not suffer a tangible employment action when a supervisor merely \u201cchange [s] her work schedule and ask[s] her to perform tasks which she had not previously been asked to perform.\u201d Watts <em>v. Kroger Co., </em>170 F.3d 505, 510 (5th Cir.1999). Because the job duties of a server at Barnhill\u2019s indisputably include some janitorial work, requiring Williams to wash the wall where servers dumped food was not a tangible employment action.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-4\">Williams argues that her assignment to \u201cthe bad sections\u201d of the restaurant amounted to a tangible employment action because it reduced the amount she earned in tips. However, Williams has not directed this court to any evidence that she earned less in tips because of Taylor\u2019s section assignments. Unsupported, conclusory speculation is insufficient to create a genuine issue of material fact. <em>See Little v. Liquid Air Corp., </em>37 F.3d 1069, 1075 (5th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b784-5\">Williams also contends that she suffered a tangible employment action because she was constructively discharged. In certain circumstances, a constructive discharge can be considered a tangible employment action. <em>Aryain v. Watt-Mart Stores Texas LP, </em>534 F.3d 473, 480-81 (5th Cir.2008). However, even assuming that Williams properly raised her claim of constructive discharge,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> she has nevertheless failed to submit evidence that would allow a reasonable jury to find that a constructive discharge occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-9\">To establish constructive discharge, an employee \u201cmust offer evidence that the employer made the employee\u2019s working conditions so intolerable that a reasonable employee would feel compelled to resign.\u201d <em>Brown v. Bunge Corp., </em>207 F.3d 776, 782 (5th Cir.2000) (quoting <em>Barrow v. New Orleans Steamship Ass\u2019n, </em>10 F.3d 292, 297 (5th Cir.1994)). The reasonableness of a plaintiffs decision is measured by an objective test. <em>Hunt v. Rapides Healthcare Sys., LLC, </em>277 F.3d 757, 772 (5th Cir. 2002). Williams did not complain about Taylor\u2019s behavior until after she resigned, and she decided to resign before Barnhill\u2019s had notice of his misconduct. Barnhill\u2019s had no opportunity to correct her situation. An employee who resigns without affording the employer a reasonable opportunity to address her concerns has not been constructively discharged. <em>See Woods v. Delta Beverage Group, Inc., </em>274 F.3d 295, 301 (5th Cir.2001) (for purposes of the constructive discharge analysis, a reasonable employee would have reported the sexual harassment before resigning); <em>see also Boze v. Branstetter, </em>912 F.2d 801, 805 (5th Cir.1990) (holding that, in most cases, a reasonable employee would pursue internal remedies or file an EEOC complaint before resigning).</p>\n<p id=\"b784-10\">Because Williams did not suffer a tangible employment action or constructive discharge, the district court did not err in granting summary judgment on Williams\u2019s quid pro quo claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-11\">B. <em>Ellerth/Faragher </em>Affirmative Defense</p>\n<p id=\"b784-12\">Williams argues that if her suit is properly analyzed as a hostile environment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"763\">*763</page-number>claim, Barnhill\u2019s has failed to establish the elements of the <em>Ellerth/Faragher </em>affirmative defense. We assume arguendo that Taylor\u2019s conduct created a hostile work environment. To establish this affirmative defense, Barnhill\u2019s must show by a preponderance of the evidence \u201c(a) that [it] exercised reasonable care to prevent and correct promptly any sexually harassing behavior, and (b) that the plaintiff employee unreasonably failed to take advantage of any preventative or corrective opportunities provided by the employer or to avoid harm otherwise.\u201d <em>Ellerth, </em>524 U.S. at 765, 118 S.Ct. at 2270; <em>Faragher, </em>524 U.S. at 807, 118 S.Ct. at 2293.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-5\">We agree with the district court that Barnhill\u2019s has satisfied both prongs of the <em>Ellerth/Faragher </em>defense as a matter of law. On the first prong, Barnhill\u2019s presented ample evidence that it exercised reasonable care to prevent Taylor\u2019s harassing behavior. The company regularly conducted training for its employees on the anti-harassment policy. Taylor stated in an affidavit that he received training on Barnhill\u2019s anti-harassment policy as a part of his orientation to the company. Approximately one year after this initial orientation, Taylor again received training regarding the anti-harassment policy and the handling of sexual harassment complaints.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-6\">Barnhill\u2019s also took prompt remedial action after Williams reported Taylor\u2019s misconduct. Barnhill\u2019s immediately suspended Taylor and began an internal investigation. Barnhill\u2019s interviewed several witnesses and reviewed tapes from the restaurant\u2019s security camera. Taylor was fired within days of when Williams reported his assault. Further, Barnhill\u2019s management made it clear to Williams that if she chose to stay, she would never be asked to work with Taylor again and informed her that he had been terminated. Barnhill\u2019s actions satisfy the first prong of the defense. <em>See Williams v. Admin. Rev. Bd., </em>376 F.3d 471, 479 (5th Cir.2004); <em>Cerros v. Steel Tech., Inc., </em>398 F.3d 944, 953 (7th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b785-8\">Barnhill\u2019s also demonstrated that Williams unreasonably failed to take advantage of the preventive or corrective opportunities the company provided. Within two months of her hire, Williams took part in an anti-harassment training session at the restaurant during which corporate representatives explained the anti-harassment policy in detail \u2014 including the proper procedure for employees to report harassment. Williams signed a form acknowledging that she had read the policy and understood the company\u2019s reporting requirements. Williams had the opportunity to meet personally with corporate representatives of Barnhill\u2019s during the training, but she chose not to notify them of Taylor\u2019s previous harassment. Indeed, she did not inform any corporate representative or manager about Taylor\u2019s conduct until the day she resigned. Although Williams did confide in two fellow servers about her encounters with Taylor, these informal complaints to co-workers were insufficient to put Barnhill\u2019s on notice of the need to address Taylor\u2019s behavior. The district court did not err in concluding that Barnhill\u2019s has satisfied the <em>Ellerth/Faragher </em>affirmative defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-9\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-10\">For these reasons, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b782-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b784-6\">. Barnhill's argues that Williams has not administratively exhausted her constructive discharge claim and that she did not properly plead constructive discharge in her complaint. We do not address these arguments because it is apparent that Williams has not raised a factual issue as to whether she was constructively discharged.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
