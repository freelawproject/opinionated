Trager, District Judge, United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b451-8\">SUMMARY ORDER</p>\n<p id=\"b451-9\">Petitioner Stephanie Inggrid Wirajaya petitions for review of the per curiam decision of the BIA, dated March 16, 2007, affirming an Immigration Judge\u2019s (\u201cIJ\u201d) oral decision, dated September 1, 2005, denying her application for asylum and withholding of removal under the Immigration and Nationality Act, as well as for protection under the United Nations Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d), and ordering her removed from the United States to Indonesia.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-10\">Wirajaya, a native and citizen of Indonesia, was admitted into the United States as a nonimmigrant visitor in September 2008. Having overstayed the expiration of her visa, she was placed in removal proceedings in January 2005. Wirajaya then timely filed an application for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under CAT. Wirajaya\u2019s application asserted that she possessed the requisite well-founded fear of persecution should she be returned to Indonesia because she is an ethnic Chinese and a practicing Christian.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-13\">After a merits hearing, IJ Steven Abrams denied her application by means of an oral decision which found that Wira-jaya \u201c[h]ad not met her burden of establishing her eligibility for asylum,\u201d and therefore necessarily failed to meet her burden for withholding of removal and CAT relief. IJ Decision at 8. After the BIA\u2019s affirmance of this decision, Wirajaya timely filed a petition for review in this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-14\">When the BIA adopts the decision of the IJ and supplements the IJ\u2019s decision, this Court reviews the decision of the IJ as supplemented by the BIA. <em>See Yan, Chen v. Gonzales, </em>417 F.3d 268, 271 (2d Cir. 2005). We review de novo questions of law and the application of law to undisputed fact. <em>See, e.g., Corovic v. Mukasey, </em>519 F.3d 90, 95 (2d Cir.2008). We review the agency\u2019s factual findings under the substantial-evidence standard, treating them as \u201cconclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary\u201d. 8 U.S.C. Section 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>see Tao Jiang v. Gonzales, </em>500 F.3d 137, 140 (2d Cir.2007). But we will vacate and remand for new findings if the agency\u2019s reasoning was sufficiently flawed. <em>Cao He Lin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>428 F.3d 391, 406 (2d Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b451-15\">We remand for reconsideration in light of our recent opinion in <em>Mufied v. Muka-sey, </em>508 F.3d 88 (2d Cir.2007). In <em>Mufied, </em>this Court identified several independent errors in the agency\u2019s reasoning and concluded that the agency had improperly failed to consider a petitioner\u2019s claim that Christians in Indonesia faced a \u201cpattern and practice\u201d of persecution sufficient to warrant a grant of asylum. The <em>Mufied </em>court found that the agency\u2019s consideration of background materials concerning country conditions erroneously focused on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>question of whether it was more likely than not that <em>\u201cthis particular person,\u201d ie., </em>the petitioner, would face persecution were he to return to Indonesia, rather than upon the possibility that the threat of harm to Chinese Christians in Indonesia evidenced a pattern or practice of persecution sufficient to warrant relief. <em>Id. </em>at 91-92 (emphasis in original). The court further concluded that the BIA\u2019s decision in <em>Matter of A-M-, </em>23 I. &amp; N. Dec. 737, 741 (B.I.A.2005), did not resolve the petition in part because that decision \u201cdoes not provide us sufficient guidance for how to evaluate a pattern or practice claim,\u201d and also because \u201cMufied relies on more recent reports and evidence\u201d than were contained in the record before the BIA in <em>Matter of AM-. Id. </em>at 92.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-4\">In this case, the agency dealt with Wira-jaya\u2019s pattern or practice claim summarily. The IJ merely noted that while \u201c[t]he documentation that the Court has before it\u201d concerning persecution of Indonesian Christians \u201cclearly tells about conflicts in Indonesia ... it does not indicate anything as far as this individual that she would have problems upon her return.\u201d IJ Decision at 8. On appeal, the BIA concluded that the IJ\u2019s decision was \u201cwholly in accordance with the Board\u2019s decision in <em>Matter of A-M-.\u201d </em>BIA Decision at 2. Because these conclusions are called into question by our reasoning in <em>Mufied, </em>remand is necessary to ensure that Wirajaya\u2019s application for relief from removal is reviewed in a manner consistent with our holding in that case.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-5\">To be sure, the agency relied on other grounds to deny Wirajaya\u2019s petition; notably, her inability to demonstrate a credible subjective fear of future persecution in light of her return to Indonesia on two occasions after she had secured a visa for entry into the United States. But it is not clear whether this finding itself might be affected by a further review of the record in light of <em>Mufied </em>because Wirajaya claims that an increased pattern of persecution in Indonesia after her return heightened her subjective fear of persecution. Accordingly, we cannot state with confidence that the agency would reach the same conclusion on remand by relying on the alternative ground of a lack of subjective fear, <em>see Xiao Ji Chen v. United States Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>471 F.3d 315, 339 (2d Cir.2006), thereby making remand unnecessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-7\">For the reasons stated above, we GRANT the petition for review, VACATE the BIA\u2019s order, and REMAND to the BIA for proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
