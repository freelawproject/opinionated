During contract litigation with Wilson Sporting Goods, Merino had sent letters to Wilson employees threatening to kill them if this court affirmed the dismissal of his complaint. <em>See Merino v. Wilson Sporting Goods Co., </em>235 Fed.Appx. 369 (7th Cir.2007). When arrested Merino was carrying a loaded gun in his car, and he already had acquired the addresses, phone numbers, and dates of birth of the people he had threatened. At sentencing the district court orally imposed a 10-month term of imprisonment, but that term was reduced to 167 days\u2014 time served in pretrial detention \u2014 in the second of three written judgments later entered by the court. These consolidated appeals arise from the second and third judgments, but appointed counsel believes the appeals are frivolous and has moved to withdraw under <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). We invited Merino to comment on counsel\u2019s submission, <em>see </em>CIR. R. 51(b), and in what Merino labels a \u201cblind reply\u201d he openly admits that he received but did not read counsel\u2019s <em>Anders </em>brief. Counsel\u2019s brief is adequate, and Merino\u2019s reply adds nothing of substance.</p>\n<p id=\"b953-18\">To address counsel\u2019s motion we must first sort through the procedural history. The district court conducted Merino\u2019s sentencing hearing on August 3, 2007, and orally imposed a 10-month term of imprisonment, with the first 167 days to be served in custody and the remainder in home confinement. The court also imposed a three-year term of supervised release, with no mention of home confinement during supervised release. At the sentencing hearing the district court also considered whether electronic monitoring would be appropriate during the period of home confinement, but ultimately decided to leave that decision to the probation office. That same day the court issued a written judgment committing Merino to the custody of the Bureau of Prisons \u201cto be imprisoned\u201d for a total of \u201cten months,\u201d with the \u201cfirst 167 days\u201d to be \u201cspent in custody\u201d and \u201cthe remainder ... to be spent in home confinement.\u201d The written judgment also imposed a three-year term of supervised release to commence upon Merino\u2019s \u201crelease from imprisonment.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"932\">*932</page-number>The clerk\u2019s office entered this first judgment on August 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b954-4\">Two more judgments followed, both sua sponte. The first, which was issued on August 7 and entered by the clerk of the district court on August 9, purports to correct a clerical mistake under the authority of Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 36. This judgment altered the term of imprisonment from 10 months to 167 days and directed that Merino be released \u201cforthwith.\u201d The judgment also reimposed the three-year term of supervised release but added a directive that Merino serve the \u201cfirst 4 and j\u00e9 months\u201d of his supervised release \u201cin home confinement without electronic monitoring.\u201d Then on August 21 the district issued its third judgment, again under the authority of Rule 36. This judgment is identical to the second, except that the period of home confinement was now to be \u201cwith electronic monitoring.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b954-5\">On August 17, 2007, after the district court had issued its second judgment, Merino filed a pro se notice of appeal. His notice of appeal does not reference either of the first two judgments but does make plain that he wanted to \u201cappeal his guilty plea.\u201d We docketed this appeal as case no. 07-2966. On August 20 counsel filed a second notice of appeal, this one \u201cfrom the final judgment entered in this action on the 9th day of August, 2007.\u201d We docketed this appeal as case no. 07-2976. Then on August 22 counsel filed a third notice of appeal, this one from the judgment issued on August 21. We docketed this last appeal as case no. 07-2988.</p>\n<p id=\"b954-6\">On August 27, this court conducted a jurisdictional screening, consolidated the two appeals filed by counsel, and issued an order explaining that \u201cpreliminary review\u201d indicated that Merino\u2019s pro se appeal \u201cduplicates later, timely appeals filed by counsel.\u201d We directed counsel (who no longer represents Merino) to either dismiss case no. 07-2966 voluntarily or else file a memorandum explaining why we should not dismiss the appeal as unnecessary. Counsel did neither, and on October 3, 2007, we dismissed that appeal and noted that \u201cMerino\u2019s appeal from his conviction and sentence will proceed under Appeal Nos. 07-2976 and 07-2988.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b954-8\">This last statement was made without the benefit of the full record, and we question whether it is correct. Only Merino\u2019s pro se notice of appeal makes reference to the guilty plea underlying the first of the district court\u2019s three judgments, but that appeal has been dismissed. The third appeal has long been moot; that case arises not from a clerical correction under Rule 36 but from a substantive modification of a condition of supervised release. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e)(4); <em>United States v. Navarro-Espinosa, </em>30 F.3d 1169, 1171 (9th Cir.1994). The new condition \u2014 the requirement of electronic monitoring during Merino\u2019s home confinement \u2014 expired when the 4)\u00e9 months of home confinement ended. So that leaves only case no. 07-2988, and unless we ignore the designation by counsel, <em>see </em>Fed. R.App. P. 3(c)(1)(B), that appeal calls up only \u201cthe final judgment entered ... on the 9th day of August, 2007.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b954-9\">That judgment was purportedly authorized by Rule 36. But that cannot be right, because the second judgment did more than correct a clerical error in the original judgment. The original judgment tracked the oral pronouncement of sentence, so it cannot be characterized as mistaken. <em>See United States v. Alburay, </em>415 F.3d 782, 788 (7th Cir.2005) (explaining that oral pronouncement of sentence controls if written judgment is inconsistent); <em>United States v. Bonanno, </em>146 F.3d 502, 511 (7th Cir.1998) (same). The judgment entered on August 9 reduced the term of imprisonment from 10 months to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"933\">*933</page-number>167 days, but Rule 86 provides for the correction of \u201cclerical errors,\u201d not for wholesale changes to the terms of a sentence or for the correction of errors the court itself made in pronouncing sentence. <em>See United States v. Becker, </em>36 F.3d 708, 710 (7th Cir.1994); <em>United States v. Dad-dino, </em>5 F.3d 262, 264-65 (7th Cir.1993). The district court did not offer, nor can we divine, any conceivable jurisdictional predicate for its second judgment. <em>See United States v. Smith, </em>438 F.3d 796, 799 (7th Cir.2006); <em>Romandine v. United States, </em>206 F.3d 731, 735 (7th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b955-5\">The revised sentence stands since it is not challenged by the government, <em>see Romandine, </em>206 F.3d at 737, but because the alteration was made without jurisdiction, Merino\u2019s appeal from the second judgment does not call into question his underlying guilty plea, which is at the center of the only potential issues counsel has identified. \u201cAn appeal from an order amending an earlier judgment does not independently bring before us the merits of the original decision.\u201d <em>LeBeau v. Taco Bell, </em>892 F.2d 605, 608 (7th Cir.1989). If this was not the case, defendants could defeat the time limits for filing a notice of appeal merely by asking the district court to enter a new judgment. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 4(b), <em>LeBeau, </em>892 F.2d at 608.</p>\n<p id=\"b955-6\">In any event, even if Merino\u2019s appeal from the second judgment confers jurisdiction for us to evaluate his guilty plea, we agree with appellate counsel that any challenge to that plea would be frivolous. Merino did not move to withdraw his guilty plea in the district court; he threatened to do so in various pro se filings but then changed lawyers and abandoned all objections to his plea. <em>See United States v. James, </em>487 F.3d 518, 527-28 (7th Cir.2007); <em>United States v. Traeger, </em>289 F.3d 461, 471 (7th Cir.2002). Our review thus would be for plain error. <em>United States v. Vonn, </em>535 U.S. 55, 59, 122 S.Ct. 1043, 152 L.Ed.2d 90 (2002); <em>United States v. Villarreal-Tamayo, </em>467 F.3d 630, 632 (7th Cir.2006). The only technical error in the plea colloquy is that Merino was not told of his right to counsel, <em>see </em>Fed. R.Crim.P. 11(b)(1)(D), but he was represented by appointed counsel at the hearing, so he must have known of this right, and the omission was harmless, <em>see United States v. Lovett, </em>844 F.2d 487, 491-92 (7th Cir.1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b955-10\">Because counsel has not identified any nonfrivolous issues on appeal, we GRAJSTT the motion to withdraw and DISMISS the appeals.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
