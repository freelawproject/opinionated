(\u201cBrady\u201d) appeals from the district court\u2019s summary judgment of invalidity, and Perfect Wall, Inc. and Metal Lite, Inc. cross-appeal from the district court\u2019s denial of their motion for attorneys\u2019 fees. Order, <em>Brady Construction Innovations, Inc. v. Perfect Wall, Inc., </em>No. 07-219 (C.D.Cal. Jun. 13, 2007) (\u201cSummary Judgment Order\u201d). We heard oral argument on July 7, 2008. Because we conclude that claim 11 of U.S. Reissued Patent No. RE39,462 (\u201cthe reissue patent\u201d), for which Brady applied more than two years after issuance of the original patent, enlarged the scope of the claims of that patent, we affirm the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment of invalidity. We also conclude that the district court did not clearly err in finding the case not exceptional and thus affirm its denial of the motion for attorneys\u2019 fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-21\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-22\">Todd Brady is the inventor of the patent at issue and the president of SlipTrack Systems and Brady Construction Innovations, Inc. (\u201cBrady\u201d).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In 1990, Todd Brady filed a patent application that issued as U.S. Patent No. 5,127,760 (\u201cthe '760 patent\u201d or \u201coriginal patent\u201d). The '760 patent claimed a building construction assembly that allows a header in a wall some vertical freedom of movement relative to the studs, such that stresses applied to the assembly do not result in wall cracks. Such a con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>figuration is useful when stresses vary in a wall for example through accumulation of snowfall or from an earthquake.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-4\">The '760 patent describes two preferred embodiments. In the first embodiment, the stud and the header are aligned and then a hole is drilled in the stud using a self-tapping screw. In the other embodiment, the holes in the stud are pre-exist-ing, allowing the stud and header to be aligned using the holes.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-5\">The original patent application contained nine claims, with claims 1 and 6 being independent. Original claim 1 recited:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b382-6\">1. A building construction assembly that includes a header and a stud wherein the header is capable of vertical movement relative to said stud comprising:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b382-7\">a header having a web and flanges with said flanges connected to said web;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b382-8\">at least one of said flanges having at least one vertical slot therein;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b382-9\">a stud having a width less than the distance between said flanges of said header;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b382-10\"><em>said stud being aligned with said vertical slot; </em>and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b382-11\">an attachment means passing through said slot and through said hole to unit[e] said header to said stud whereby said slot permits said header to move vertically with respect to said stud while restricting horizontal movement of said header.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b382-12\">J.A. at 268 (emphasis added).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b382-13\">The examiner rejected all nine claims in the original application as indefinite and obvious. As to indefiniteness, the examiner queried, \u201chow is the stud \u2018aligned\u2019 with the vertical slot?\u201d J.A. at 259.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In response, Brady canceled claims 6 through 9, and in claim 1, the only remaining independent claim, Brady deleted the limitation that the stud be \u201caligned with said vertical slot\u201d and amended it to read \u201csaid stud having at least one hole formed therein proximal to said top end.\u201d Brady explained: \u201c[T]he Examiner\u2019s question of how the stud is aligned with the vertical slot has been answered by adding hole 22 proximal to top end 40 of the stud as an element of the claims. The hole 22 serves as a reference point on the stud which is used to align the stud and the slot.\u201d J.A. at 278. In the same response, Brady also added a new independent claim 7, which included the same limitation now in claim 1: \u201csaid stud having at least one hole formed therein proximal to said top end.\u201d The examiner ultimately allowed the claims as amended, and the '760 patent issued in 1992.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-17\">As issued, claim 1 of the '760 patent recited:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b382-18\">1. A building construction assembly that includes a header and a stud wherein the header is capable of vertical movement relative to said assembly comprising:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b382-19\">a header having a web and flanges with said flanges connected to said web;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b382-20\">at least one of said flanges having at least one vertical slot therein;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b382-21\">a stud having a width less than the distance between said flanges of said header and having a top end;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b382-22\">\n<em>said stud having at least one hole formed therein proximal to said top end;</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b383-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>said top end fitting between said flanges perpendicular to said header positioned so that said hole is aligned with said vertical slot; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Au\">an attachment means passing through said slot and through said hole to slide-ably unite said header to said stud whereby said slot permits said header to move vertically with respect to said stud while restricting horizontal movement of said header.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b383-5\">760 patent, col.4 ll.35-54 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b383-6\">SlipTrack then sued Metal Lite in the Central District of California alleging that the '760 patent had priority over a Metal Lite patent that issued on the same day, and that Metal Lite\u2019s products infringed the '760 patent. In September 2003, a jury found that the '760 patent was entitled to priority, that Metal Lite\u2019s products infringed the '760 patent, and that Slip-Track was entitled to damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-7\">On appeal, this court affirmed the priority determination but vacated and remanded the infringement determination. <em>Slip Track Sys., Inc. v. Metal Lite, Inc., </em>113 Fed.Appx. 930 (Fed.Cir.2004). Specifically, this court held that the claim limitation \u201csaid stud having at least one hole formed therein proximal to said top end\u201d means \u201cthat a hole must be formed in the stud prior to insertion of the stud between the flanges so that the hole can be used to align the stud with the vertical slot before passing the attachment means through the vertical slot and into the stud.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 938. This court based its claim construction primarily on statements in the prosecution history, holding that \u201cthe prosecution history of the '760 patent reveals that the patentee limited its invention to studs having pre-existing holes.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 937.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We vacated the district court\u2019s judgment of infringement and remanded for further proceedings consistent with our claim construction. <em>Id. </em>at 938.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-10\">On remand, the district court granted Metal Lite\u2019s motion for summary judgment of non-infringement because the accused products did not use studs with preexisting holes. <em>Slip Track Sys., Inc. v. Metal Lite, Inc., </em>No. 98-20 AHS, slip op. at 8 (C.D. Cal. June 15, 2005). Although SlipTrack initially appealed that decision, it later moved to voluntarily dismiss its appeal. <em>Slip Track Sys., Inc. v. Metal-Lite, Inc., </em>168 Fed.Appx. 943 (Fed.Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b383-11\">On February 5, 2005, following our claim construction decision and more than twelve years after the original patent issued, Brady filed an application for reissue of its '760 patent. The reissue application included all of the original claims and one additional claim:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b383-12\">11. A building construction assembly that includes a header and a stud wherein the header is capable of vertical movement relative to said assembly comprising:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b383-13\">a header having a web and flanges with said flanges connected to said web; at least one of said flanges having at least one vertical slot therein;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b383-14\">a stud having a width less than the distance between said flanges of said header and having a top end;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b383-15\">said stud having <em>at least one hole formed therein </em>proximal to said top end <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number><em>by an attachment means </em>passing through said slot and through said hole to slideably unite said header to said stud whereby said slot permits said header to move vertically with respect to said stud while restricting horizontal movement of said header;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b384-4\">said top end fitting between said flanges perpendicular to said header positioned so that said hole is aligned with said vertical slot.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b384-5\">Reissue patent, eol.6 11.6-27 (emphasis added). In prosecuting the reissue, Brady alerted the PTO to the fact that two courts, including this court, had construed claim 1 of the '760 patent to cover only one of the disclosed embodiments in the patent and made clear that claim 11 was being added in reissue to claim the preferred embodiment that had been excluded by our claim construction. But Brady argued that claim 11 was narrower in scope than original claim 1 because claim 11 requires the additional limitation that the hole be made by a self-tapping screw. Metal Lite protested the reissue application before the PTO, although the examiner may not have considered the protest since it was never included as part of the reissue file wrapper. The examiner allowed claim 11 stating: \u201c[N]ewly presented claim 11 includes all of the limitations of previously allowed claim 1 with the additional limitation \u2018by\u2019 [] which further narrows the scope to a specific embodiment of the invention wherein the \u2018at least one hole\u2019 is formed by the \u2018attachment means\u2019 [ ].\u201d J.A. at 158.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-6\">In June 2006, after receiving the Notice of Allowability as to the reissue application, Brady issued an \u201cIndustry Announcement,\u201d which stated that it would receive \u201ca new patent for [its] SLP-TRK Brand slotted track product.\u201d The announcement also stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b384-7\">Previously, the Court of Appeals had limited the original slotted track patent in a way that Brady never intended. This new patent removes the limitation recently imposed by the Court of Appeals. From this date forward, anyone who manufactures and sells <em>[any style of\\ </em>slotted track will infringe Brady\u2019s new patent regardless of how the slotted track is installed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b384-8\">J.A. at 438 (emphasis in original). The patent reissued on January 9, 2007.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-9\">The same day, Brady sued a number of companies including Perfect Wall, Inc., Metal Lite, Inc., Steeler, and SCAFCO (collectively \u201cdefendants\u201d), alleging that certain \u201cslotted track products\u201d infringed the claims of the reissue patent. Defendants moved for summary judgment of invalidity as to the reissue patent. The district court issued a tentative ruling on June 11, 2007, tentatively granting defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment of invalidity because the reissue violated Section 251\u2019s prohibition on broadening reissues more than two years after the original patent issued, denying Metal Lite\u2019s motion on the alternative ground that the reissue violated the recapture rule, and denying Metal Lite\u2019s motion for attorney\u2019s fees. Following a hearing on the motions, the district court granted the motion for summary judgment of invalidity on June 13, 2007. The district court concluded that claim 11 \u201cincludes within its scope a user who places a stud without a pre-existing hole between the flanges of the header and then creates the hole through the stud with a self-tapping screw.\u201d Summary Judgment Order at 7. Because reissue claim 11 broadened the scope of the original patent and Brady filed his reapplication more than two years after the original patent issued, the district court held reissue claim 11 invalid. The district court also denied Metal Lite\u2019s motion for attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>ii.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-5\">We review a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment de novo. <em>Ethicon Endo-Surgery, Inc. v. U.S. Surgical Corp., </em>149 F.3d 1309, 1315 (Fed.Cir.1998). At summary judgment, all ambiguous facts and inferences must be construed in the light most favorable to the non-movant. <em>Id. </em>Summary judgment is only appropriate if no genuine issues of material fact exist and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b385-6\">\n<em>A. Reissue Validity</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b385-7\">Under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 251, a patentee can seek reissue of his patent when he \u201cthrough error without any deceptive intention ... elaim[ed] more or less than he had a right to claim in the patent.\u201d If the patentee seeks reissue more that two years from the grant of the original patent, however, the reissued patent cannot \u201cenlarg[e] the scope of the claims of the original patent.\u201d <em>Id.</em><footnotemark><em>5</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b385-8\">\u201cWhether the claims of a reissue patent violate 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 251, and thus are invalid, is a question of law, which we review de novo.\u201d <em>N. Am. Container, Inc. v. Plasti-pak Packaging, Inc., </em>415 F.3d 1335, 1349 (Fed.Cir.2005). In this case, we conclude that Brady\u2019s reissue claim 11, the only asserted claim, enlarged the scope of the claims of the original patent. Since Brady applied for reissue more than two years after issuance of the original patent, the reissue violated Section 251, and we affirm the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment of invalidity.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b385-11\">This court has held:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b385-12\">A claim of a reissue application is broader in scope than the original claims if it contains within its scope any conceivable apparatus or process which would not have infringed the original patent. A reissue claim that is broader in any respect is considered to be broader than the original claims even though it may be narrower in other respects.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b385-13\"><em>Tillotson, Ltd. v. Walbro Coup., </em>831 F.2d 1033, 1037 n. 2 (Fed.Cir.1987); <em>see also In re Freeman, </em>30 F.3d 1459 (Fed.Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b385-14\">In this case, the accused products did not infringe the claims of the original patent as construed by this court in <em>Slip Track Systems, Inc. v. Metal Lite, Inc., </em>113 Fed.Appx. 930 (Fed.Cir.2004), which held that the claim limitation \u201csaid stud having at least one hole formed therein proximal to said top end\u201d was limited to a pre-existing hole. Under the principles of stare decisis and the Supreme Court\u2019s guidance in <em>Markman, </em>this court follows the claim construction of prior panels absent exceptional circumstances. <em>Miken Composites, L.L.C. v. Wilson Sporting Goods Co., </em>515 F.3d 1331, 1338 n. * (Fed. Cir.2008) (\u201c[Tjreating interpretive issues as purely legal will promote (though it will not guarantee) intrajurisdictional certainty through the application of stare decisis.\u201d (quoting <em>Markman v. Westview Instruments, Inc., </em>517 U.S. 370, 391, 116 S.Ct. 1384, 134 L.Ed.2d 577 (1996))).</p>\n<p id=\"b386-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>Brady does not ask that we explicitly overrule the prior panel\u2019s construction of the claims of the original patent, and Brady admits that products that would not infringe the claims of the original patent do infringe reissue claim 11. This is because reissue claim 11 requires that \u201csaid stud having <em>at least one hole formed therein </em>proximal to said top end <em>by an attachment means.\u201d </em>In other words, in reissue claim 11, the hole is not preexisting but is formed using a self tapping screw (the attachment means disclosed in the specification). Because products in which the hole is not pre-existing but instead formed using a self-tapping screw (i.e., the accused products in this case) would not infringe the claims of the original patent but would infringe reissue claim 11, we conclude that reissue claim 11 enlarged the scope of the original patent. We affirm the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment of invalidity as to that claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-4\">B. <em>Attorney\u2019s Fees</em></p>\n<p id=\"b386-5\">Metal Lite and Perfect Wall (collectively \u201cMetal Lite\u201d) cross-appeal the district court\u2019s denial of their motion for attorney\u2019s fees. In reviewing a district court\u2019s decision on Section 285 attorney\u2019s fees, we review the decision as to whether the case is exceptional for clear error, and we review the subsequent determination as to whether fees are appropriate for abuse of discretion. <em>Cybor Corp. v. FAS Techs., Inc., </em>138 F.3d 1448, 1460 (Fed.Cir.1998) (en banc). Metal Lite argues that the district court erred in not finding the case exceptional because Brady made misrepresentations to the PTO during prosecution of the reissue patent, namely that claim 11 was narrower than the original claims. The district court determined that Brady or its counsel had not committed inequitable conduct:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-6\">I can tell you that based upon everything I know of this case and these inventions, which is probably more than I ever care to know in a lifetime, that the record from what I can see does not support a conclusion of inequitable conduct by the patentee or counsel for the patentee.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b386-8\">J.A. at 1793. The district court did not clearly err in concluding that Brady did not commit inequitable conduct. In the reissue prosecution, Brady provided the PTO with this court\u2019s prior decision in which we limited the claims of the original patent to only those with pre-existing holes. Brady argued to the PTO that claim 11 was narrower based on the same arguments it advances here. Nevertheless, the PTO could have rejected those arguments, and the district court did not clearly err in finding that Brady did not commit inequitable conduct and the case was not exceptional on that basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-9\">Metal Lite also argues that the case is exceptional because Brady filed suit in bad faith, knowing that claim 11 was invalid as a broadening reissue. While Brady\u2019s press release stating that the reissue patent \u201cremoves the limitation recently imposed by the Court of Appeals\u201d suggests that Brady may have known that its claim 11 was not narrower, the district court was in the best position to observe Brady and its counsel both during the prior case and this case. We see no clear error in its determination that the present litigation was not brought in bad faith.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-10\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-11\">In sum, we affirm the district court\u2019s summary judgment of invalidity as to reissue claim 11 because that claim enlarged the scope of the original patent claims and Brady applied for reissue more than two years after the original patent issued. We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>also affirm the district court\u2019s denial of attorneys\u2019 fees.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b381-16\">. Brady Construction Innovations, Inc. was formerly known as SlipTrack.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b382-14\">. Claim 6 included a limitation that an \"elongated slotted passage\u201d be \u201caligned\u201d with the stud.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b382-23\">. The examiner also cited the \"aligned\u201d limitation of claim 6, the only other independent claim, as having the same indefiniteness problem.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b383-8\">. Just before our decision construing this claim term, a different district court in a case involving the same patent but a different defendant also concluded that the claims of the '760 patent require a pre-existing hole. <em>Slip-Track Sys., Inc. v. Steeler Metals, Inc., </em>No. C-04-0462-PVT, slip op. at 11 (N.D.Cal. Oct. 12, 2004). This court issued a Rule 36 affir-mance of that decision. <em>Sliptrack Sys., Inc. v. Steeler Metals, Inc., </em>158 Fed.Appx. 283 (Fed. Cir.2005).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b385-9\">. Metal Lite argues, as an alternative ground for affirmance, that Brady\u2019s reissue patent violated the recapture rule. The recapture rule, however, bars certain reissues <em>within </em>the first two years after the original patent issued if the patentee voluntarily surrendered claim scope during the original prosecution. <em>E.g., N. Am. Container, Inc. v. Plastipak Packaging, Inc., </em>415 F.3d 1335, 1340, 1349 (Fed.Cir.2005); <em>Ball Corp. v. United States, </em>729 F.2d 1429, 1433, 1436 (Fed.Cir. 1984). In this case, Brady did not apply for reissue until well after the two-year period had expired, making the recapture rule inapplicable. Thus, we need only determine whether the reissue violates the proscription in Section 251 that reissues outside the two-year period may not \u201denlarge[e] the scope of the claims of the original patent.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
