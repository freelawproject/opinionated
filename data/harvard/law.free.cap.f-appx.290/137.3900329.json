MURPHY, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b160-15\">Andrew J. O\u2019Connor appeals pro se from a district court order that dismissed his civil rights lawsuit. He argues that his pleadings should have been liberally construed and that there are ongoing constitutional violations. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-16\">\n<em>Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b160-17\">On July 25, 2006, O\u2019Connor filed his lawsuit pro se, claiming that on February 13, 2003, he was in Santa Fe, New Mexico, at the St. John\u2019s College Library using the library computers, when he was \u201cfalsely arrested and denied his civil liberties and right to due process of law.\u201d R., Doc. 2 at 8. He alleged that Associated Security Industries (ASI), which purportedly handled St. John\u2019s security needs, contacted agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), who in turn instructed the Santa Fe Police Department to arrest and detain him for questioning by the Secret Service. O\u2019Connor asserted that his arrest and interrogation were punishment for his \u201cantiwar views and for publicly dissenting against the policies of the Bush Administration.\u201d R., Doc. 42 at 4. Additionally, he claimed that the country\u2019s terror alert system had been manipulated for political purposes, that the Secret Service had contacted his doctors and family, and that there was a \u201cwhispering campaign\u201d to interfere with his employment prospects. R., Doc. 2 at 4 (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b160-18\">O\u2019Connor named as defendants: St. John\u2019s College; ASI; Santa Fe Police Officers Steve Altonji, Eric Wheeler, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>Bruce Pratz; former Secretary of Homeland Security Tom Ridge; FBI special agent Sandra Klein; and Secret Service special agents Jeremy Allison and Mike Rose. O\u2019Connor claimed that the defendants\u2019 actions violated 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1988, 1985(3), and 1986, as well as <em>Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents of Federal Bureau of Narcotics, </em>403 U.S. 388, 91 S.Ct. 1999, 29 L.Ed.2d 619 (1971), and New Mexico civil-conspiracy law.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In an amended complaint, he incorporated the earlier complaint\u2019s allegations and added that St. John\u2019s and ASI are monitoring other library patrons\u2019 emails, and that in January 2007 his \u201cresidence was broken into and illegally searched,\u201d two \u201cfalse and negative newspaper articles\u201d about him appeared in a newspaper, and he \u201creceived an unsolicited email from an Islamic website.\u201d R., Doc. 42 at 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-5\">St. John\u2019s, ASI, and the Santa Fe police officers moved to dismiss under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), arguing that O\u2019Connor\u2019s claims were barred by the statute of limitations. The federal defendants also raised the statute of limitations, seeking dismissal or summary judgment. They submitted the declaration of Agent Allison, who stated that O\u2019Connor \u201chad been detained for allegedly making threatening statements towards the President of the United States while logged onto a computer,\u201d and that the Secret Service had ended its investigation of O\u2019Connor in April 2003. R., Doc. 82 at 15. In regard to former Secretary Ridge, the federal defendants argued that he was immune from suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-7\">At a hearing on the motions, O\u2019Connor argued that his claims were not time barred because the defendants\u2019 actions were part of an ongoing conspiracy, as he had recently been followed by Denver police and had received a telephone call inquiring whether he sold marijuana. After the hearing, the district court issued a summary order, dismissing O\u2019Connor\u2019s complaints. O\u2019Connor now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-8\">\n<em>Discussion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b161-9\">I. Standards of Review</p>\n<p id=\"A4u\">We review de novo a district court\u2019s ruling that a claim is barred by the statute of limitations. <em>See Sterlin v. Biomune Sys., </em>154 F.3d 1191, 1194 (10th Cir.1998). In the context of Rule 12(b)(6), we accept all well-pleaded factual allegations in the complaint as true and view them in the light most favorable to the plaintiff to determine whether the statute of limitations has been met. <em>See Sunrise Valley, LLC v. Kempthorne, </em>528 F.3d 1251, 1254 (10th Cir.2008). But in the context of summary judgment, we must determine whether the moving party has demonstrated that there is no genuine issue of material fact as to the running of the statute of limitations. <em>See Tiben v. Cigna Corp., </em>89 F.3d 1423, 1428 (10th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b161-10\">We also apply de novo review to issues of sovereign immunity. <em>Governor of Kansas v. Kempthorne, </em>516 F.3d 833, 841 (10th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b161-11\">Finally, while we generally construe pro se \u201cpleadings and filings liberally,\u201d <em>Lewis v. Commissioner, </em>523 F.3d 1272, 1273 n. 1 (10th Cir.2008), we do not extend that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>same policy to pro se litigants who, like O\u2019Connor, are also attorneys, <em>Comm, on the Conduct of Attorneys v. Oliver, </em>510 F.3d 1219, 1223 (10th Cir.2007).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b162-4\">II. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983</p>\n<p id=\"b162-5\">Section 1983 provides a remedy for constitutional violations committed by state actors. <em>Jojola v. Chavez, </em>55 F.3d 488, 492 (10th Cir.1995). A \u00a7 1983 claim arising in New Mexico is subject to a three-year statute of limitations. <em>Mondragon v. Thompson, </em>519 F.3d 1078, 1081 (10th Cir. 2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b162-6\">When the challenged action is an arrest, interrogation, and detention, the \u00a7 1983 claim accrues \u201cwhen the victim is released\u201d or becomes the subject of \u201csufficient legal process.\u201d <em>Mondragon, </em>519 F.3d at 1082-83. Here, O\u2019Connor alleged that he was arrested, detained, interrogated, and released on February 13, 2003. He did not file suit, however, until July 25, 2006 \u2014 more than three years after a claim against any of the state defendants accrued.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Consequently, O\u2019Connor\u2019s \u00a7 1983 claim against the state defendants based on his arrest, detention, and interrogation is time barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-7\">To the extent that O\u2019Connor\u2019s pleadings could be construed as challenging the monitoring of his computer communications by St. John\u2019s or ASI, that challenge would also be time barred. Secret Service agents Rose and Allison told O\u2019Connor during his detention that he was being investigated because he had been observed \u201cmaking threatening remarks about President Bush in an Internet chat room.\u201d Aplt. Br. at 9. Thus, O\u2019Connor\u2019s \u00a7 1983 claim based on internet monitoring accrued on February 13, 2003, and he failed to sue within three years of that date. <em>See Smith v. City of Enid ex rel. Enid City Comm\u2019n, </em>149 F.3d 1151, 1154 (10th Cir.1998) (stating that an action accrues in a \u00a7 1983 case when \u201cthe plaintiff knows or should have known that his or her constitutional rights have been violated\u201d (quotation omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b162-12\">III. <em>Bivens</em></p>\n<p id=\"b162-13\"><em>Bivens </em>provides an action for money damages against federal officials who, acting in their individual capacities, violate a person\u2019s constitutional rights. <em>Farmer v. Perrill, </em>288 F.3d 1254, 1256 &amp; n. 1 (10th Cir.2002). Like a \u00a7 1983 action, a <em>Bivens </em>action arising in New Mexico has a three-year statute of limitations, and it accrues when the claimant knew or had reason to know \u201cof the existence and cause of the injury which is the basis of his action.\u201d <em>Indus. Constructors Corp. v. United States Bureau of Reclamation, </em>15 F.3d 963, 968-69 (10th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b162-14\">To the extent O\u2019Connor\u2019s <em>Bivens </em>claim targeted FBI special agent Klein and Secret Service special agents Allison and Rose for liability based on his arrest, detention, and interrogation, the claim is time-barred as explained above in Part II. And while the Secret Service did, as O\u2019Connor alleged, contact O\u2019Connor\u2019s family members and doctors, it is undisputed that those contacts occurred more than three years before O\u2019Connor sued.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-15\">Finally, O\u2019Connor\u2019s claim against former Secretary Ridge is jurisdietionally foreclosed. While O\u2019Connor alleged that he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>was suing former Secretary Ridge in his individual capacity, it appears that the gist of O\u2019Connor\u2019s claim concerns Ridge\u2019s assigned task of running the country\u2019s terror-alert system. Viewed as such, O\u2019Con-nor\u2019s claim is in reality against Ridge in his official capacity, <em>see West v. Atkins, </em>487 U.S. 42, 50, 108 S.Ct. 2250, 101 L.Ed.2d 40 (1988), and is subject to the bar of sovereign immunity, <em>see Pleasant v. Lovell, </em>876 F.2d 787, 793-94 (10th Cir.1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b163-5\">IV. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1985(3)</p>\n<p id=\"b163-6\">Section 1985(3) provides a remedy for a conspiracy to violate a person\u2019s civil rights. <em>Tilton v. Richardson, </em>6 F.3d 683, 686 (10th Cir.1993). The applicable statute of limitations is the same period that governs O\u2019Connor\u2019s \u00a7 1983 claims, <em>see Robinson v. Maruffi, </em>895 F.2d 649, 653-54 (10th Cir. 1990), and it runs separately from each overt act of the conspiracy that allegedly caused injury, <em>see Scherer v. Balkema, </em>840 F.2d 437, 439 (7th Cir.1988); <em>see also Robinson, </em>895 F.2d at 655 (indicating that conspiracies involving \u201cdiscrete claims of [constitutional] wrongs, despite their being averred as a continuing wrong,\u201d accrue when the plaintiff is injured). Consequently, O\u2019Connor \u201cmay recover only for the overt acts that [he] specifically alleged to have occurred within the limitations period.\u201d <em>Scherer, </em>840 F.2d at 439 (quotation and ellipses omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b163-7\">While O\u2019Connor appears to allege acts of the conspiracy that occurred within three years of the date he sued\u2014 such as the burglary and search of his residence in January 2007 \u2014 he does not allege involvement by any defendant. Section 1985(3) conspiracy claims cannot stand on \u201cvague and conclusory allegations\u201d; but rather, \u201cmust be pled with some degree of specificity.\u201d <em>Ctr. for Bio-Ethical Reform, Inc. v. City of Springboro, </em>477 F.3d 807, 832 (6th Cir.2007); <em>cf. Hunt v. Bennett, </em>17 F.3d 1263, 1266 (10th Cir. 1994) (observing that \u201c[c]onclusory allegations of conspiracy are insufficient to state a valid \u00a7 1983 claim\u201d (quotation omitted)). The only alleged act committed by a specified defendant within the limitations period is St. John\u2019s and ASI\u2019s monitoring of <em>other </em>library patrons\u2019 computer uses. But O\u2019Connor lacks standing to assert the constitutional rights of those individuals. <em>See Cotner v. Hopkins, </em>795 F.2d 900, 902 (10th Cir.1986) (recognizing the general rule \u201cthat a plaintiff must assert his own constitutional rights\u201d). Consequently, we conclude that O\u2019Connor\u2019s \u00a7 1985(3) claim is time barred.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b163-10\">O\u2019Connor\u2019s conspiracy claim brought under New Mexico law is time barred as well. <em>See Williams v. Stewart, </em>137 N.M. 420, 112 P.3d 281, 285 (N.M.Ct.App.2005) (applying three-year statute of limitations to conspiracy claim).</p>\n<p id=\"b163-11\">V. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1986</p>\n<p id=\"Ak8\">Section 1986 allows an action against a party who knows that a \u00a7 1985(3) violation will occur, has the pow<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>er to prevent it, and fails to do so. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1986. The statute of limitations to bring a \u00a7 1986 claim is one year after the claim accrues. <em>Id. </em>As noted above, no defendant is alleged to have engaged in a \u00a7 1985(3) violation against O\u2019Connor within three years of the filing of his complaint. It necessarily follows that no defendant could have failed to prevent such a violation within one year of the complaint\u2019s filing. O\u2019Connor\u2019s \u00a7 1986 claim is, therefore, time barred. <em>See Brown v. Reardon, </em>770 F.2d 896, 907 (10th Cir.1985) (observing that a \u201c\u00a7 1986 claim is dependent upon the existence of a valid claim under 1985\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b164-4\">\n<em>Conclusion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b164-5\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-6\">O\u2019Connor\u2019s motion to proceed on appeal in forma pauperis is DENIED for lack of a \u201creasoned, nonfrivolous argument on the law and facts in support of the issues raised in the action.\u201d <em>Lister v. Dep\u2019t of Treasury, </em>408 F.3d 1309, 1312 (10th Cir. 2005).</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b160-12\"> After examining the briefs and appellate record, this panel has determined unanimously that oral argument would not materially assist the determination of this appeal. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument. This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed. R.App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b161-6\">. To the extent that O'Connor attempts to assert a claim for relief under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988(a), we note that the statute \"does not create independent causes of action, it simply defines procedures under which remedies may be sought in civil rights actions.\u201d <em>Hi-dahl v. Gilpin County Dep\u2019t of Soc. Servs., </em>938 F.2d 1150, 1152 (10th Cir.1991) (quotation omitted). And while \u00a7 1988(b) \"permits the award of costs and attorney fees to a prevailing plaintiff in a civil rights action,\u201d O\u2019Con-nor has not prevailed. <em>Brown v. Reardon, </em>770 F.2d 896, 907 (10th Cir.1985).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b162-8\">. But even if we were to liberally construe O\u2019Connor\u2019s pleadings and filings, it would make no difference to the outcome of this . appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b162-16\">. Because we are resolving O\u2019Connor\u2019s \u00a7 1983 claims on the basis of the statute of limitations, we need not determine whether ASI was employed by St. John\u2019s and acted under color of state law at the time of O\u2019Con-nor\u2019s arrest.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b163-8\">. We also note that O\u2019Connor\u2019s \u00a7 1985(3) claim rests on questionable footing because \u00a7 1985(3) applies only to conspiracies motivated by \"some racial, or perhaps otherwise class-based, invidiously discriminatory animus.\u201d <em>Griffin v. Breckenridge, </em>403 U.S. 88, 102, 91 S.Ct. 1790, 29 L.Ed.2d 338 (1971). While the Supreme Court has not yet decided whether the statute covers wholly non-racial, politically motivated conspiracies, <em>see United Bhd. of Carpenters &amp; Joiners of Am., Local 610, AFL-CIO v. Scott, </em>463 U.S. 825, 836-37, 103 S.Ct. 3352, 77 L.Ed.2d 1049 (1983), and while other Courts of Appeal are split on the issue, <em>see Farber v. City of Paterson, </em>440 F.3d 131, 135, 138-39 (3d Cir.2006) (collecting cases), our court has signaled that \u00a7 1985(3) requires at least a \"commingling of racial and political motives.\u201d <em>Brown v. Reardon, </em>770 F.2d 896, 907 (10th Cir.1985). O\u2019Connor does not appear to claim that there is any sort of racial component to the alleged conspiracy.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
