For the reasons that follow, we will affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-20\">Inasmuch as we write primarily for the parties who are familiar with this case, we need not recite the factual or procedural background except insofar as may be helpful to our brief discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-21\">Williams argues that the district court abused its discretion by allowing the government to introduce 4 prior convictions when only 1 was needed to establish the elements of the offense he was charged with, that the district court improperly enhanced his sentence under the Armed Career Criminal Act based upon a prior conviction for a \u201cserious drug offense\u201d that was not established by the records introduced at sentencing, and that the district court improperly considered his prior convictions in determining his sentence because those convictions were not contained in the indictment nor were they established by proof beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-22\">Although we agree that, under the circumstances here, it would have been better for the prosecutor to limit her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>proofs of the defendant\u2019s prior convictions, a prior felony conviction was nevertheless an element of the offense Williams was charged with. Thus, the government had to establish that he was a convicted felon when he possessed the firearm charged in this indictment. The government has represented in its brief and at oral argument that it offered to stipulate that Williams was a convicted felon in order to avoid the problem of introducing evidence of his criminal record before the jury. Williams does not deny that he refused that stipulation. This case is therefore distinguishable from <em>Old Chief v. United States, </em>519 U.S. 172, 117 S.Ct. 644, 136 L.Ed.2d 574 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b499-5\">We realize, of course, that a defendant never has to agree to stipulate to any fact. Rather, he/she can always demand that the government prove every element of the crimes charged beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>In re Winship, </em>397 U.S. 358, 364, 90 S.Ct. 1068, 25 L.Ed.2d 368 (1970). However, we can not conclude that the district court abused its discretion in allowing the government to introduce evidence of more than 1 conviction to establish a fact that the defendant refused to stipulate to.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-6\">Moreover, the district court was obviously concerned about the potential for prejudice and took all reasonable steps to ensure that the jury did not misuse this evidence. The court gave a very strong instruction on the limited use of the evidence of the defendant\u2019s prior convictions the morning after the testimony was introduced. In doing so, the court noted that it would again instruct on this \u201cimportant matter\u201d and informed the jury that it was giving a cautionary instruction \u201cto make sure that you have it clear in your mind immediately [,]\u201d that the evidence of Williams\u2019 record was introduced for a very limited purpose and could only be considered for that purpose, and no other. \u2018We generally presume that juries follow instructions given by the District Court, ...\u201d. <em>United States v. Hakim, </em>344 F.3d 324, 326 (3d Cir.2003). There is nothing on this record to suggest that the jury ignored the court\u2019s instructions. As we noted at the outset, although, given the quality of proof that the government was able to introduce to establish each of the defendants prior convictions, it was \u201cgilding the lilly\u201d to introduce 4 convictions when 1 would have sufficed. Nevertheless, for the reasons we have just explained, there was no abuse of discretion in allowing the prosecutor to do so here.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-8\">We also do not believe that the district court erred in enhancing the defendant\u2019s sentence pursuant to the Armed Career Criminal Act based upon his prior conviction for a \u201cserious drug offense.\u201d At sentencing, Williams argued that the records from the prior conviction did not establish that a prior conviction was for a \u201cserious drug offense\u201d as required under \u00a7 924(e)(2)(A) because the offense involved both marijuana and cocaine. Possession of marijuana with intent to distribute is punishable by a sentence up to 5 years imprisonment under Pennsylvania law whereas possession with intent to distribute cocaine is punishable by a sentence to up to 10 years imprisonment. <em>See </em>35 Pa. Cons. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 780-113(a)(30), (f)(l.l), (2). However, Williams was sentenced to a period of incarceration of not less then 1 year nor more then 10 years on that charge. Given the 10 year maximum, the government clearly established by a preponderance of the evidence that his prior conviction subjected him to the Armed Career Criminal enhancement. Accordingly, the district court did not err in using that state court conviction under the Armed Career Criminal Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-9\">Finally, Williams argues that prior convictions could not be used to enhance his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>sentence unless they were first charged in the indictment and proved beyond a reasonable doubt. That argument is now foreclosed by our holding in <em>United States v. Grier, </em>475 F.3d 556 (3d Cir.2007) <em>(en </em>banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b500-4\">Accordingly, for the reasons set forth herein, we will affirm the judgment of sentence and conviction.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
