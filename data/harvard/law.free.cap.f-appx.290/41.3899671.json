We affirm the district court\u2019s denial of the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-8\">The district court denied Lopez\u2019s amended petition in its entirety and issued a certificate of appealability on the second ground for relief, concerning whether Lopez\u2019s trial should have been severed from that of his co-defendant, Kevin Lisle. The severance issue is the only one before this court on appeal.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b64-9\">1. \u201cAn application for a writ of habeas corpus ... shall not be granted with respect to any claim that was adjudicated on the merits in State court proceedings unless the adjudication of the claim (1) resulted in a decision that was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States ...\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d). \u201cStated simply, a federal habeas court making the \u2018unreasonable application\u2019 inquiry should ask whether the state court\u2019s application of clearly established federal law was objectively unreasonable.\u201d <em>Williams v. Taylor, </em>529 U.S. 362, 409, 120 S.Ct. 1495, 146 L.Ed.2d 389 (2000). We review a district court\u2019s decision to deny a petition for a writ of habeas corpus <em>de novo. Drayden v. White, </em>232 F.3d 704, 708 (9th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b64-13\">1. Under clearly established Supreme Court law, the decision to try defendants jointly is generally left to the discretion of the trial court. <em>Zafiro v. United States, </em>506 U.S. 534, 539, 113 S.Ct. 933, 122 L.Ed.2d 317 (1993). The Supreme Court has \u201crepeatedly ... approved of joint trials,\u201d because they \u201cpromote efficiency and serve the interests of justice by avoiding the scandal and inequity of inconsistent verdicts.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 537, 113 S.Ct. 933 (internal quotation omitted); <em>see also Buchanan v. Kentucky, </em>483 U.S. 402, 418, 107 S.Ct. 2906, 97 L.Ed.2d 336 (1987). At the same time, a refusal to sever can \u201crise to the level of a constitutional violation,\u201d but only if it \u201cresults in prejudice so great as to deny a defendant his Fifth Amendment right to a fair trial.\u201d <em>United States v. Lane, </em>474 U.S. 438, 446 n. 8, 106 S.Ct. 725, 88 L.Ed.2d 814 (1986). \u201c[I]t is well settled that defendants are not entitled to severance merely because they may have a better chance of acquittal in separate trials.\u201d <em>Zafiro, </em>506 U.S. at 540, 113 S.Ct. 933.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-14\">3. Against this legal background, Lopez\u2019s argument boils down to two claims: first, that the trial court\u2019s decision to try Lopez and co-defendant Lisle jointly prevented him from introducing relevant exculpatory evidence; and second, that the introduction of substantial evidence admissible against Lisle \u2014 most notably several <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>out-of-court confessions by Lisle \u2014 undermined the jury\u2019s ability to accurately assess the guilt of each individual defendant, prejudicing Lopez.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b65-5\">(i) With regard to his first argument, Lopez maintains that the joint trial prevented him from introducing evidence that Lisle was the shooter in both the Lusch murder and an unrelated murder which occurred shortly thereafter, and that Lisle had a character for spontaneously engaging in acts of violence. Exclusion of exculpatory evidence does not rise to the level of a constitutional violation unless it \u201cinfringed upon a weighty interest of the accused\u201d or \u201csignificantly undermined fundamental elements of the defendant\u2019s defense.\u201d <em>United States v. Scheffer, </em>523 U.S. 303, 308, 315, 118 S.Ct. 1261, 140 L.Ed.2d 413 (1998). Here, the excluded testimony was not central to the defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-6\">The jury heard testimony from several witnesses that three people drove out to the desert on the night in question: Lopez, Lisle, and the victim, Justin Lusch. The jury also heard testimony relaying Lopez\u2019s confession to an acquaintance, John Melcher. Lopez told Melcher that, after driving out to the desert with Lusch and a third person, Lopez watched in the rear-view mirror as this third person shot Lusch. Although the trial court did not permit Melcher to testify that Lopez specifically identified Lisle as the \u201cother guy,\u201d the implication was clear. More importantly, Melcher\u2019s testimony \u2014 even in redacted form \u2014 established the central element of Lopez\u2019s defense, that Lopez himself was <em>not </em>the shooter. Excluding the portion of Lopez\u2019s out-of-court confession to Melcher specifically identifying Lisle as the shooter did not undermine any \u201cfundamental element\u201d of Lopez\u2019s defense. <em>See id. </em>at 315, 118 S.Ct. 1261.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-11\">The evidence specifically identifying Lisle as the shooter in the unrelated murder of Kip Logan two months after the Lusch murder was similarly peripheral to Lopez\u2019s defense. The trial court\u2019s refusal to allow the identification of Lisle as Logan\u2019s murderer did not implicate Lopez in that murder. Further, the trial court permitted Lopez to present evidence that he was not in Las Vegas when Logan was killed.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-12\">Nor was identifying Lisle as the shooter in the Logan murder relevant to establish Lisle\u2019s <em>modus operandi. </em>Engaging in \u201cacts of extreme violence\u201d without forewarning falls well short of establishing a defendant\u2019s identity or <em>modus operandi. See, e.g., United States v. Perkins, </em>937 F.2d 1397, 1400-01 (9th Cir.1991) (finding characteristics \u201csimilar to numerous other crimes\u201d insufficient to establish <em>modus op-erandi </em>).</p>\n<p id=\"b65-13\">(ii) With regard to his second argument, Lopez contends that the admission of evidence against Lisle, most notably Lisle\u2019s multiple out-of-court confessions, deprived him of a fair trial. We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-14\">The trial court issued an appropriate limiting instruction each time a witness testified to a statement made by Lisle outside Lopez\u2019s presence. In addition, the trial court reinforced the limiting instructions with Jury Instruction 22, which reminded jurors that \u201c[a]ny evidence admitted solely against one defendant may be considered only as against that defendant and may not, in any respect, enter into your deliberations on any other defendant.\u201d Under clearly established Supreme Court law, such limiting instructions were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>sufficient to preserve the fundamental fairness of Lopez\u2019s joint trial. <em>See Richardson v. Marsh, </em>481 U.S. 200, 206, 107 S.Ct. 1702, 95 L.Ed.2d 176 (1987) (noting \u201cthe almost invariable assumption of the law that jurors follow their instructions\u201d). Moreover, none of Lisle\u2019s confessions inculpated Lopez, rendering their admission at a joint trial not unduly prejudicial. <em>See Gray v. Maryland, </em>523 U.S. 185, 192-94, 118 S.Ct. 1151, 140 L.Ed.2d 294 (1998); <em>Richardson, </em>481 U.S. at 211, 107 S.Ct. 1702.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-4\">In sum, although \u201ca particular case of misjoinder may be so egregious as to constitute a deprivation of due process,\u201d <em>United States v. Lane, </em>474 U.S. at 461 n. 3, 106 S.Ct. 725 (Brennan, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part), Lopez has not shown that the trial court\u2019s denial of his severance motion in this case constituted an \u201cunreasonable application\u201d of clearly established Supreme Court law. The district court\u2019s denial of the petition for a writ of habeas corpus is therefore AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b64-10\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9 th Cir. R. 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b64-11\">. Lopez has not briefed any of the other grounds asserted in his amended petition for a writ of habeas corpus. <em>See </em>9th Cir. R. 22-1(e) (allowing issues properly labeled and briefed as \"uncertified issues\u201d to be treated as a motion to expand the certificate of appeala-bility).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b65-7\">. Lopez also argues that the trial court's denial of his motion to sever led the jury to convict him on insufficient evidence. The State correctly notes that this claim was initially raised as a separate ground for relief in Lopez's second amended petition for a writ of habeas corpus (Ground 1), and therefore falls outside the certificate of appealability.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
