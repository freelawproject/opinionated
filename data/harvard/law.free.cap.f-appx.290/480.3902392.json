We exercise plenary review over this determination by the District Court, and will affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-24\">In May 1987, Harmon pled guilty to possession with intent to distribute a controlled substance in violation of 35 P.S. \u00a7 780-113(a)(30). Not all violations of this statute qualify as \u201cserious drug offenses\u201d that trigger the application of the 15-year mandatory minimum sentence under the ACCA. A \u201cserious drug offense\u201d under the federal statute requires \u201can offense under State law, involving manufacturing, distributing, or possessing with intent to manufacture or distribute, a controlled substance ... for which a maximum term of imprisonment of ten years or more is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>prescribed by law.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(2)(A)(ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b503-5\">The maximum sentence that may be imposed for violation of the Pennsylvania law under which Harmon was convicted is determined by the particular drug possessed. 35 P.S. \u00a7 T80 \u2014 113(f). Thus, possession with intent to deliver cocaine is punishable by up to 15 years\u2019 imprisonment and is therefore an ACCA-qualifying offense, while possession with intent to deliver several other controlled substances has a maximum penalty lower than ten years\u2019 imprisonment. <em>Id. </em>Therefore, only if the controlled substance was cocaine can Harmon\u2019s May 1987 conviction qualify as a \u201cserious drug offense\u201d under the ACCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-6\">Our analysis is guided by the United States Supreme Court\u2019s opinion in <em>Shepard v. United States, </em>544 U.S. 13, 125 S.Ct. 1254, 161 L.Ed.2d 205 (2005), wherein the Court discussed the way in which we are to determine whether a conviction qualifies as a violent felony under ACCA. There, the government argued that the description of the offense as set forth in a police report submitted to a local court as grounds for issuing a complaint constituted sufficient proof of the nature of the conviction. The Supreme Court disagreed.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-7\">The <em>Shepard </em>Court noted that in <em>Taylor v. United States, </em>495 U.S. 575, 110 S.Ct. 2143, 109 L.Ed.2d 607 (1990), it had held that \u201ca court sentencing under the ACCA could look to statutory elements, charging documents, and jury instructions to determine whether an earlier conviction after trial was for generic burglary.\u201d 544 U.S. at 16, 125 S.Ct. 1254. The Court then held that police reports cannot be relied upon and stated that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b503-8\">[Wjithout a <em>charging document that narrows the charge </em>to generic limits, the only certainty of a generic finding lies in jury instructions, or bench-trial findings and rulings, or (in a pleaded case) in the defendant\u2019s own admissions or accepted findings of fact confirming the factual basis for a valid plea. In this particular pleaded case, the record is silent on the generic element, there being no plea agreement or recorded colloquy in which Shepard admitted the generic fact.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b503-10\">544 U.S. at 25, 125 S.Ct. 1254 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b503-11\">Here, the government urges that there is a specific charging document that does \u201cnarrow the charge\u201d to cocaine. We agree. The charging document states that Harmon \u201cfeloniously did manufacture, deliver or possess with intent to manufacture or deliver a controlled substance classified under Schedule I, II, or III. Cocaine.\u201d App. 153. On the reverse side of that document, there is the handwritten notation above Harmon\u2019s signature that states, \u201cI plead guilty to possession with intent to deliver a controlled substance.\u201d App. 152.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-12\">Harmon contends that the fact that he did not write the word \u201ccocaine\u201d after the indication of his plea means that he was pleading guilty as to a controlled substance, but not to cocaine. However, because we have the specific charging document and Harmon\u2019s signed guilty plea on the reverse side, we find it sufficiently clear, under <em>Shepard, </em>that Harmon pled guilty to the charged offense. This is a commonsense reading of the document.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-13\">Accordingly, we will AFFIRM the Judgment and Conviction Order of the District Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
