A79 055 966, A79 055 968, A79 055 964, A79 055 965 (B.I.A. Aug. 15, 2007). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-23\">We review the BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to reopen for abuse of discretion. <em>See Kaur v. BIA, </em>413 F.3d 232, 233 (2d Cir. 2005) (per curiam). \u201cAn abuse of discretion may be found ... where the [BIA\u2019s] decision provides no rational explanation, inexplicably departs from established policies, is devoid of any reasoning, or contains only summary or conclusory statements; that is to say, where the Board has acted in an arbitrary or capricious manner.\u201d <em>Ke Zhen Zhao v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>265 F.3d 83, 93 (2d Cir.2001) (internal citations omitted). In conducting our review, we remain mindful of the Supreme Court\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>admonition that motions to reopen are \u201cdisfavored.\u201d <em>INS v. Abudu, </em>485 U.S. 94, 107, 108 S.Ct. 904, 99 L.Ed.2d 90 (1988); <em>see also Maghradze v. Gonzales, </em>462 F.3d 150, 154 (2d Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b457-5\">We conclude that the BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying Metovic\u2019s motion to reopen. It is undisputed that his motion to reopen was untimely where it was not filed within 90 days of the agency\u2019s final order of removal issued in October 2004. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(2). The BIA also properly found that Metovic\u2019s motion did not qualify for the changed country conditions exception to the time limitation. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(3)(ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b457-6\">Metovie submitted numerous affidavits and news articles with his motion to reopen, arguing that they demonstrated changed circumstances in Montenegro. However, the affidavits, which detail the experiences of ethnic Albanians in present-day Montenegro, did not demonstrate <em>changed </em>country conditions. <em>Cf. Norani v. Gonzales, </em>451 F.3d 292, 293, 295 (2d Cir. 2006). Similarly, the news articles he submitted did not show any change in Montenegro\u2019s policy regarding conscientious objectors and draft evaders, who had been granted amnesty prior to Metovic\u2019s original merits hearing. Therefore the BIA properly denied the motion to reopen because Metovie failed to submit evidence demonstrating that conditions in Montenegro had deteriorated since his hearing and that any such change in conditions was material to his claim that he would be punished for evading the draft. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(C)(ii); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(3)(ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b457-8\">Finally, there is no merit to Metovic\u2019s claim that the BIA ignored background materials. He misreads the BIA\u2019s decision to state that conditions in Montenegro had not changed when, in fact, the BIA found no \u201cchanged circumstances in Montenegro <em>which would warrant reopening.\u201d </em>(emphasis added). While Metovie argues that conditions have changed insofar as Montenegro gained independence since his merits hearing, he fails to argue how this is a \u201cmaterial\u201d change that affects his eligibility for relief. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(3)(ii). Thus, absent compelling evidence to the contrary, we presume that the agency considered all of the evidence and we find that it properly denied Meto-vic\u2019s untimely motion to reopen. <em>See Xiao Ji Chen v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>471 F.3d 315, 336 n. 17 (2d Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b457-10\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. As we have completed our review, any stay of removal that the Court previously granted in this petition is VACATED, and any pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot. Any pending request for oral argument in this petition is DENIED in accordance with Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 34(a)(2), and Second Circuit Local Rule 34(b).</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b456-24\">.
