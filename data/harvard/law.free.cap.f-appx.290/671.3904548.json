Both cases were removed from state court to federal court, and in both cases, the district court declined to remand to state court, and instead entered orders of dismissal on almost identical grounds. For the reasons provided below, we AFFIRM the district court in both cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-14\">I. FACTS AND PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b694-15\">Defendant-Appellee Humana Health Plan of Texas, Inc. (\u201cHumana\u201d)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> is a Texas corporation that, at all relevant times, offered health care benefits under plans that it administered and maintained for certain employers (hereinafter referred to individually or collectively as \u201cthe Plan\u201d). Eric Carstens (\u201cCarstens\u201d) and Mary Wil-liby (\u201cWilliby\u201d) were participants in the Plan, and it is undisputed that the Plan is an \u201cemployee welfare benefit plan\u201d pursuant to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001 (\u201cERISA\u201d). The respective lawsuits largely concern treatments that Carstens and Williby each received from Plaintiff-Appellant Quality Infusion Care, Inc. (\u201cQIC\u201d) for which QIC seeks payment from Humana.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-16\">A. Case # 1 \u2014 The Carstens Claim</p>\n<p id=\"b694-17\">On or before March 7, 2005, Carstens began to suffer from septic arthritis. To treat this condition, his physician prescribed a course of home infusion therapy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number>for which Carstens and his physician chose QIC to provide the drugs necessary for such treatment. QIC provided Carstens the prescribed drugs from approximately March 7, 2005 until July 1, 2005, at a cost of $8,114.48. As part of their relationship, QIC asserts that \u201call of Carstens\u2019s rights, benefits, and claims under the Plan were assigned to [QIC].\u201d After its treatment of Carstens, QIC sought payment from Hu-mana. Humana refused because it said that QIC is an out-of-network provider\u2014 something QIC has not denied \u2014 and, as such, is ineligible for payment under the terms of the Plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-5\">Faced with Humana\u2019s denial of payment to QIC for services it rendered to Car-stens, QIC filed suit with an Original Petition (or \u201ccomplaint\u201d) on April 17, 2006 in a Texas state court. In its complaint, QIC provided as its \u201cCause of Action\u201d alleged violations of Texas\u2019s \u201cany willing provider\u201d statute (\u201cAWP\u201d). The AWP provides, <em>inter alia, </em>that a health care plan may not prohibit a pharmacy from participating \u201cas a contract provider under the ... plan\u201d if it otherwise meets \u201call terms and requirements and to include the same administrative, financial, and professional conditions that apply to pharmacies and pharmacists who have been designated as providers under the policy or plan.\u201d Tex. Ins.Code Ann. art. \u00a7 2(a)(2). QIC contends that it met all such \u201cterms and requirements.\u201d For its relief, QIC seeks $8,111.48 in payment for the prescription drugs that it provided to Carstens, as well as resulting damages, interest, fees, and costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-8\">Humana filed an answer by general denial on May 18, 2006, and then, on May 25, 2006, removed the case to federal court, arguing that QIC\u2019s \u201cclaim is preempted by federal law under [ERISA] as codified in 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1132.\u201d On April 25, 2007, Humana moved to dismiss under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), arguing that QIC would be eligible for reimbursement not under the terms of the Plan because it is an out-of-network provider, but only through the AWP, which, by its nature, is \u201ccompletely preempted by ERISA\u201d because the only benefits it can give to such providers are those otherwise provided by the Plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-9\">On May 15, 2007, QIC responded to Humana\u2019s motion to dismiss and moved to remand.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> QIC argued that its claim is not preempted by ERISA \u2014 and, thus, is not a federal question for removal purposes\u2014 because at a minimum, the AWP is a law that regulates insurance, and, thus, is \u201csaved from preemption\u201d by ERISA\u2019s \u201csavings clause,\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1144(b)(2)(A). Given this assertion, QIC argues that the case should be remanded to state court. QIC did not contest dismissal apart from its argument concerning lack of subject matter jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-10\">On August 14, 2007, the district court denied QIC\u2019s motion to remand and granted Humana\u2019s motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6), which it treated as a motion for judgment on the pleadings under Rule 12(c).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The district court distinguished between (1) \u201ccomplete\u201d preemption, which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number>the Supreme Court held in <em>Aetna Health Inc. v. Davila, 542 </em>U.S. 200, 209, 124 S.Ct. 2488, 159 L.Ed.2d 312 (2004), includes \u201cany state-law cause of action that duplicates, supplements, or supplants the ... civil enforcement remedy\u201d in ERISA \u00a7 502 and thereby offers a basis for removal, and (2) \u201cexpress\u201d or \u201cconflict\u201d preemption, which under ERISA \u00a7 514 covers state laws that \u201crelate to an[ ] employee benefit plan,\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1144(a), yet unlike complete preemption, includes a \u201csavings\u201d exception for state laws that \u201cregulate! ] insurance,\u201d <em>id. \u00a7 </em>1144(b)(2)(A), and provides only a federal defense and not a basis for removal. The district court held that QIC\u2019s claim under the AWP is subject to complete preemption, not conflict preemption, because it is ultimately a claim for benefits, albeit by assignment, under the terms of the Plan \u2014 a classic form of relief under ERISA \u00a7 502.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The district court noted that the AWP \u201cdoes not give rise to obligations independent of ERISA or plan terms, because it prohibits a plan from restricting an insured\u2019s choice of pharmacy only to the extent that the policy itself provides coverage for the services.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"apx-dedup-0\">In support of its holding, the district court not only cited the Supreme Court\u2019s opinion in <em>Davila, </em>but also three other cases in the same district on the same issues and to similar <em>ends </em>\u2014 Quality <em>Infusion Care, Inc. v. Unicare Health Plans of Texas, </em>No. 4:06-CV-3752, 2007 WL 1887734 (S.D.Tex. June 29, 2007); <em>Quality Infusion Care, Inc. v. Unicare Health Plans of Texas, </em>No. 4:06-CV-1689, 2007 WL 760368 (S.D.Tex. Mar. 8, 2007); <em>Quality Infusion Care, Inc. v. Aetna Health Inc., </em>No. 4:05-CV-3308, 2006 WL 3813774 (S.D.Tex. Dec. 26, 2006). The district court distinguished the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Kentucky Ass\u2019n of Health Plans, Inc. v. Miller, </em>538 U.S. 329, 123 S.Ct. 1471, 155 L.Ed.2d 468 (2003), which found a similar AWP law in Kentucky to be saved from preemption as a law regulating insurance, because it said that <em>Miller </em>\u201cdealt with [conflict] preemption under [ERISA] \u00a7 514, not complete preemption under [ERISA] \u00a7 502(a).\u201d In the end, because the district court concluded that the application of the AWP at issue was subject to complete preemption, not only did it hold that the action was removable to federal court, but also that the savings clause of ERISA \u00a7 514 did not apply. As to Humana\u2019s motion to dismiss, the district court found that it must grant the motion because QIC\u2019s \u201csole claim for relief is not viable, and QIC has neither sought to amend its claim nor asserted that its claim is cognizable under ERISA.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b696-6\">QIC appeals and notes six issues for review; although, as its counsel suggested at the outset of oral argument, all of them come down to the argument that conflict, not complete, preemption is how the district court \u201cshould have analyzed the case.\u201d In short, QIC claims that its AWP claim is an independent claim that does not duplicate ERISA\u2019s enforcement provisions and could not have been brought by QIC under ERISA, and, thus, if anything, is subject only to conflict (not complete) preemption, together with its savings clause, which QIC says applies under <em>Miller. </em>Hu-mana counters that the AWP claim depends upon an interpretation of an ERISA plan and could be brought by QIC through the assignment of rights by Carstens, and, thus, is subject to complete preemption (without savings), which Humana argues yields removal \u2014 and ultimately dismissal\u2014 under <em>Davila.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b697-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"675\">*675</page-number>B. Case # 2 \u2014 The Williby Claim</p>\n<p id=\"b697-5\">On or before December 21, 2004, Williby began to suffer from a colon condition. To treat this condition, Williby\u2019s physician prescribed a course of home infusion therapy and she and her physician chose QIC to provide the drugs necessary for such treatment. QIC provided Williby the prescribed drugs from approximately December 21, 2004 until March 24, 2005, at a cost of $31,921.59. As part of their relationship, QIC asserts that \u201call of Williby\u2019s rights, benefits, and claims under the Plan were assigned to [QIC].\u201d After treating Williby, QIC sought payment from Huma-na, but Humana refused on the same out-of-network grounds as in Case # 1. Nevertheless, and as in Case # 1, QIC claims that \u201cpursuant to\u201d the AWP, it \u201cis entitled to payment from [Humana] pursuant to the Plan for the ... drugs [it] <em>provided.\u201d</em><footnotemark><em>5</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Again, QIC claims that it met all \u201cterms and requirements\u201d for coverage under the AWP.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-6\">Faced with Humana\u2019s denial of payment for services it rendered to Williby, QIC filed suit with an Original Petition (or \u201ccomplaint\u201d) on December 28, 2006 in a Texas state court. For its relief, QIC seeks $31,921.59 in payment for the drugs it provided to Williby, as well as resulting damages, interest, fees, and costs. In response, Humana filed an Original Answer by general denial on April 10, 2007. Two days later, Humana removed the case to federal court, arguing that QIC\u2019s claim is preempted by ERISA. On June 13, 2007, Humana moved to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6), arguing, as in Case # 1, that QIC\u2019s only claim is an AWP claim that is \u201ccompletely preempted\u201d by ERISA and subject to dismissal because the only benefits it can give are those otherwise provided by the Plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-11\">On August 23, 2007, QIC responded to Humana\u2019s motion. Unlike Case # 1, it did not move to remand.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In its response, QIC relied almost exclusively on <em>Miller, </em>arguing that its claim is not preempted because, at a minimum, the AWP is an insurance regulation, and is therefore \u201csaved from preemption\u201d under 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1144(b)(2)(A). Unlike Case # 1, in its response, QIC asked for leave to amend in the event that the court found preemption. QIC\u2019s request was not addressed by the district court, though QIC did not appeal this issue.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b697-12\">On October 19, 2007, the district court granted Humana\u2019s motion to dismiss. It did not address an effort by Humana to convert its motion to one for judgment on the pleadings. Based on the reasoning in the other QIC cases noted above by the court in Case # 1 \u2014 as well as that of the court in Case # 1 itself \u2014 the district court found that \u201c[b]ecause [QIC] is seeking benefits allegedly due under a Plan outside of and in addition to ERISA\u2019s remedial scheme, complete preemption applies.\u201d Therefore, the court concluded that it must grant Humana\u2019s motion because QIC\u2019s \u201cclaim for relief under the AWP is not viable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b698-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"676\">*676</page-number>QIC appeals and notes three issues for review, all of which mirror the theme in Case # <em>1 </em>\u2014 i.e., complete ERISA preemption does not apply because its AWP claim is an independent one that does not duplicate ERISA\u2019s enforcement provisions and could not have been brought by QIC under ERISA. QIC argues that, if anything, its claim would only be subject to conflict preemption, and then saved as an insurance regulation under <em>Miller. </em>As in Case # 1, Humana counters that the AWP claim depends upon an interpretation of the Plan and could be brought by QIC through Williby\u2019s assignment, and, thus, is subject to complete preemption under <em>Davila. </em>It also adds that QIC failed to discuss complete preemption below. As QIC contends, however, even the district court noted that, \u201c[t]he parties dispute whether ERISA completely preempts [QIC]\u2019s claims,\u201d not to mention that the issue is essentially jurisdictional.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-4\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b698-5\">Although the appeals in Case # 1 and Case #2 concern both removal and dismissal (or judgment on the pleadings), the choice by QIC to limit itself to state law claims results in the cases essentially being limited to one, central question: Are QIC\u2019s respective claims under the AWP \u201ccompletely preempted\u201d by ERISA? For the reasons provided below, we conclude that they are.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-6\">A. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b698-7\">This court reviews a district court\u2019s denial of a motion to remand a case from federal court to state court, or a mere refusal to remand <em>sua sponte, </em>under a <em>de novo </em>standard. <em>See Sherrod v. Am. Airlines, Inc., </em>132 F.3d 1112, 1117 (5th Cir. 1998). Moreover, \u201cwhen faced with a motion to remand, it is the defendant\u2019s burden to establish the existence of federal jurisdiction over the controversy.\u201d <em>Winters v. Diamond Shamrock Chem. Co., </em>149 F.3d 387, 397 (5th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b698-9\">This court also reviews a grant of judgment on the pleadings under Rule 12(c) <em>de novo. See Hughes v. Tobacco Inst., Inc., </em>278 F.3d 417, 420 (5th Cir.2001). A motion for judgment under Rule 12(c) is subject to the same standard as a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6). <em>See Johnson v. Johnson, </em>385 F.3d 503, 529 (5th Cir.2004). \u201c[T]he central issue is whether, in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, the complaint states a valid claim for relief.\u201d <em>Hughes, </em>278 F.3d at 420 (internal quotations omitted). Although the factual allegations in the plaintiffs pleadings must be accepted as true, <em>see id., </em>a plaintiff must plead \u201cenough facts to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face,\u201d <em>Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, </em>550 U.S. 544, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 1974, 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b698-10\">B. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b698-11\">As the Supreme Court held in <em>Davila, </em>\u201c \u2018causes of action within the scope of the civil enforcement provisions of [ERISA] \u00a7 502(a) [are] removable to federal court.\u2019\u201d 542 U.S. at 209, 124 S.Ct. 2488 (quoting <em>Metro. Life Ins. Co. v. Taylor, </em>481 U.S. 58, 66, 107 S.Ct. 1542, 95 L.Ed.2d 55 (1987)). \u201c[T]he ERISA civil enforcement mechanism is one of those provisions with such \u2018extraordinary pre-emptive power\u2019 that it \u2018converts an ordinary state common law complaint into one stating a federal claim for purposes of the well-pleaded complaint rule.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Metro. Life, </em>481 U.S. at 65-66, 107 S.Ct. 1542). In Case # 1, QIC states that its only claim \u201cseek[s] payment for the prescription drugs it provided to [Carstens] under the Texas AWP statute.\u201d In Case #2, QIC states, \u201c[p]ursuant to [the AWP], [it] is entitled to payment from [Humana] pursuant to the Plan for the ... drugs [it] provided to Williby.\u201d We hold that QIC\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"677\">*677</page-number>claims are \u201cwithin the scope\u201d of \u00a7 502(a), and, thus, are removable under the complete preemption described in <em>Davila. </em>542 U.S. at 209,124 S.Ct. 2488.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Furthermore, because QIC\u2019s only claims are preempted state law claims, we hold that dismissal, or in the alternative, judgment on the pleadings, is appropriate as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-5\">(1) Removal</p>\n<p id=\"b699-6\">Under the removal statute, \u201cany civil action brought in a State court of which the district courts have original jurisdiction, may be removed by the defendant\u201d to federal court. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1441(a). The type of original jurisdiction at issue here is federal question jurisdiction, which covers cases \u201carising under the Constitution, laws, or treaties of the United States.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1381. Ordinarily, \u201carising under\u201d is determined by the \u201cwell-pleaded complaint <em>rule\u201d </em>\u2014 i.e., \u201c \u2018a defendant may not [generally] remove a case to federal court unless the <em>plaintiffs </em>complaint establishes that the case \u2018arises under\u2019 federal law.\u2019 \u201d <em>Davi-la, </em>542 U.S. at 207,124 S.Ct. 2488 (quoting <em>Franchise Tax Bd. of Cal. v. Constr. Laborers Vacation Trust for S. Cal., </em>463 U.S. 1, 10, 103 S.Ct. 2841, 77 L.Ed.2d 420 (1983)). Here, QIC\u2019s complaints cite the AWP as the chief basis for their claims. However, there is an exception to the well-pleaded complaint rule \u2018\u201cwhen a federal statute wholly displaces the state-law cause of action through complete preemption.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Beneficial Nat\u2019l Bank v. Anderson, </em>539 U.S. 1, 8, 123 S.Ct. 2058, 156 L.Ed.2d 1 (2003)). As noted above, the Supreme Court held in <em>Davila </em>that such preemption that would permit removal regardless of the plaintiffs complaint applies to \u201ccauses of action within the scope of the civil enforcement provisions of [ERISA] \u00a7 502(a).\u201d 542 U.S. at 209, 124 S.Ct. 2488.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-9\">The pertinent provision of ERISA \u00a7 502(a) is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b699-10\">A civil action may be brought\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b699-11\">(1) by a participant or beneficiary\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b699-12\">(B) to recover benefits due to him under the terms of his plan, to enforce his rights under the terms of the plan, or to clarify his rights to future benefits under the terms of the plan ...</blockquote>\n<p id=\"af9-dedup-0\">29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1132(a)(1)(B). The foregoing provision, together with other actions authorized for participants, beneficiaries, or the Secretary of Labor to redress other statutory violations, such as failure to provide plan information or breach of fiduciary duty, <em>see id. </em>\u00a7 1132(a), as well as other remedies left <em>out </em>\u2014 e.g., damages for certain benefit denials, <em>see Pilot Life Ins. Co. v. Dedeaux, </em>481 U.S. 41, 57, 107 S.Ct. 1549, 95 L.Ed.2d 39 (1987) \u2014 offer \u201ca comprehensive civil enforcement scheme\u201d that the Supreme Court has described as \u201crepresent[ing] a careful balancing of the need for prompt and fair claims settlement procedures against the public interest in encouraging the formation of employee benefit plans,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 54, 107 S.Ct. 1549.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-13\">The Texas AWP provides, in pertinent part, that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b699-14\">Sec. 2.

Bahr, Comment, <em>Although Offering More Freedom to Choose, \u201cAny Willing Provider\u201d Legislation is the Wrong Choice, </em>45 U. Kan. L.Rev. 557, 582 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b700-10\">In Case # 1, QIC concedes that it \u201casserted no other claims\u201d than \u201cseeking payment for the prescription drugs it provided to [Carstens],\u201d but it contends that such a claim arises from the AWP and not ERISA. In Case #2, QIC claims \u201cpayment\u201d under the Plan for Williby\u2019s drugs, but also asserts that its claim is only under the AWP and not ERISA. In short, QIC argues that its claims are \u201cdiscrimination claims\u201d under the AWP, and not claims for benefits, and, thus, would not duplicate ERISA\u2019s enforcement provisions, as required for complete preemption. In arguing that the AWP stands alone as the source of its claims, QIC stresses the AWP language that a <em>\u201cplan ... may not ... deny a pharmacy </em>... <em>the right to participate </em>as a contract provider under the policy or plan if the pharmacy ... agrees to provide pharmaceutical services that meet all terms and requirements.... \u201d Tex. Ins. Code Ann. art. 21.52B \u00a7 2(a)(2) (emphasis added). Moreover, QIC contends that even if such claims were otherwise covered by ERISA, it lacks standing to assert them and, thus, its claims under the AWP cannot duplicate ERISA enforcement in any event.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-12\">Humana argues that QIC\u2019s claims are completely preempted because, no matter how QIC labels them, in each case QIC is making a claim for benefits under the Plan. Thus, Humana argues that QIC\u2019s claims are covered by ERISA \u00a7 502(a)(1)(B). In arguing that QIC\u2019s claims depend upon the Plan, Humana emphasizes the AWP language that a pharmacy\u2019s right to participate arises only if it \u201cagrees to provide ... services that meet <em>all terms and requirements and ... conditions </em>that apply to pharmacies ... who have been designated as providers <em>under the policy or plan </em>....\u201d Tex. Ins.Code Ann. art. 21.52B \u00a7 2(a)(2) (emphasis added). As for standing, Humana asserts that a third-party provider of health care has standing to make a claim under \u00a7 502(a)(1)(B) where, as here, there has been an assignment to the provider by the participant.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-15\">In <em>Davila, </em>the Supreme Court confronted state claims against HMOs for negligence \u201cin the handling of coverage decisions\u201d under their benefit plans. 542 U.S. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"679\">*679</page-number>at 204, 124 S.Ct. 2488. In a unanimous decision, the Court held that such claims were completely preempted under ERISA despite any violation of state law because \u201cinterpretation of the terms of [plaintiffs\u2019] benefit plans formfed] an essential part of their [state law] claim.\u201d <em>Id, </em>at 213, 124 S.Ct. 2488. In so holding, the Court noted that there would be no state question at all if the benefits at issue were not available under the plans. <em>See id. </em>Similarly, there would be no AWP question here if the \u201cterms\u201d and \u201crequirements\u201d of the Plan were not met. Indeed, the AWP itself expressly disclaims any mandate of pharmaceutical benefits by its terms. <em>See </em>Tex. Ins.Code Ann. art. 21.52B \u00a7 4 (\u201cThis article does not require a health insurance policy or managed care plan to provide pharmaceutical services.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b701-5\">QIC confesses a lack of independence from the Plan when it states in its complaints that it \u201cprovided prescription drugs ... to [Carstens and Williby] pursuant to the terms of the Plan and the Texas AWP statute. As such, [QIC] is entitled to payment from [Humana] pursuant to the Plan....\u201d In essence, QIC\u2019s AWP claims are for benefits under the Plan and, thus, are completely preempted and subject to removal, regardless of any difference in their elements, <em>see Davila, 542 </em>U.S. at 216, 124 S.Ct. 2488, or how artful QIC is in its pleadings, <em>see McGowin v. ManPower Int\u2019l, Inc., </em>363 F.3d 556, 559 (5th Cir.2004). <em>See also Quality Infusion, </em>2006 WL 3813774, at *7 (applying similar analysis to AWP); <em>Cleghorn, v. Blue Shield of Cal., </em>408 F.3d 1222, 1224-26 (9th Cir.2005) (holding that a claim based on an insurer\u2019s failure to provide \u201cemergency\u201d benefits under state law is completely preempted because \u201cthe factual basis of the complaint ... was the denial of reimbursement of plan benefits\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b701-8\">As far as standing is concerned, QIC argues that even if its AWP claims were otherwise dependent on the Plan, it lacks standing to bring a claim under ERISA and, therefore, its claims cannot meet the enforcement \u201cduplication\u201d requirement for complete ERISA preemption. To that point, the Supreme Court held in <em>Davila </em>that complete preemption not only requires a plan-dependent claim, but also that \u201can individual, at some point in time, could have brought his claim under ERISA \u00a7 502[ ].\u201d 542 U.S. at 210, 124 S.Ct. 2488. Yet, as QIC itself repeatedly emphasized in the district court, both Carstens and Williby expressly assigned their \u201crights, benefits, and claims under the Plan.\u201d \u201cIt is well established that a healthcare provider, though not a statutorily designated ERISA beneficiary, may obtain standing to sue derivatively to enforce an ERISA plan beneficiary\u2019s claim.\u201d <em>Harris Methodist Fort Worth v. Sales Support Servs., Inc. Employee Health Care Plan, </em>426 F.3d 330, 333-34 (5th Cir.2005); <em>see also Tango Transport v. Healthcare Fin.

Of these several cases, only <em>Blue Cross, Lone Star,</em><footnotemark><em>10</em></footnotemark><em> </em>and <em>Memorial Hermann </em>are arguably helpful to QIC given that there was no assignment in either <em>Tenet, see </em>2005 WL 1038072, at *2, or <em>Pascack, see </em>388 F.3d at 401, nor were there any plan benefits at issue for the cited claims in <em>Children\u2019s Hospital, see </em>360 F.Supp.2d at 206, or <em>Memorial Hospital System, see </em>904 F.2d at 250.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b702-4\">In <em>Blue Cross, </em>the Ninth Circuit held that a claim for breach of a medical plan\u2019s duty to pay providers under a provider agreement was not preempted. 187 F.3d at 1051-52. In <em>Lone Star, </em>a district court found that claims under state insurance law for breach of an insurer\u2019s agreement with a health care provider were not preempted. 557 F.Supp.2d at 807-09. Finally, in <em>Memorial Hermann, </em>a district court found that claims for breach of an insurer\u2019s obligation to pay a provider under a managed care agreement and in accordance with a statutory timetable were not preempted. 2007 WL 1701901, at *1. Each of the foregoing three cases included among their facts an assignment of rights by recipients of related health care services. <em>See Blue Cross, </em>187 F.3d at 1052; <em>Lone Star, </em>557 F.Supp.2d at 807; <em>Memorial Hermann, </em>2007 WL 1701901, at *4.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-8\">QIC argues that, like the contracts in <em>Blue Cross, Lone Star, </em>and <em>Memorial Her-mann, </em>the AWP acts as an independent source of rights outside of the Plan and/or its participants. However, as all three cases point out, the disputes there were \u201cnot over the <em>right </em>to payment, which might be said to depend on the patients\u2019 assignments to the [providers [of benefits under the terms of a plan], but the <em>amount, </em>or level, of payment, which depends on the terms of [entirely separate and non-plan dependent] provider agreements.\u201d <em>Blue Cross, </em>187 F.3d at 1051; <em>Memorial Hermann, </em>2007 WL 1701901, at *5 (quoting same language); <em>see also Lone Star, </em>557 F.Supp.2d at 794-95 (describing plaintiffs argument to same effect). The opinions in each case found that the amounts there depended chiefly upon contracts between provider and insurer, as well as applicable state law, and not any ERISA plan. <em>See Blue Cross, </em>187 F.3d at 1051; <em>Lone Star, </em>557 F.Supp.2d at 807-09; <em>Memorial Hermann, </em>2007 WL 1701901, at *5.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-9\">The AWP is perhaps a means by which QIC can gain some rights, but the right to payments, as well as their amounts, in the cases at hand \u2014 at least from Humana\u2014 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number>depend upon the Plan. Here, the claims not only involve participants and assignments, they also rely on Plan \u201cterms and requirements.\u201d Tex. Ins.Code Ann. art. 21.52B \u00a7 2(a)(2). Although QIC contends on appeal that its claims are merely for independent discrimination under the AWP, its repeated invocation of the assignments by Carstens and Williby, along with its express claim in both complaints to being \u201centitled to payment ... pursuant to the Plan for the [exact amounts] in prescription drugs,\u201d distinguishes QIC\u2019s claims in such complaints as assignment-based, rather than independent, claims for relief under the \u201cterms and requirements\u201d of the Plan.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Consequently, we hold that, as alleged, the Plan \u201cforms an essential part of [QIC\u2019s AWP] claim[s],\u201d and, thus, such claims are subject to complete preemption. <em>Davila, </em>542 U.S. at 213, 124 S.Ct. 2488.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-5\">Unlike the payors in <em>Blue Cross, Lone Star, </em>or <em>Memorial Hermann </em>\u2014 each of which had a duty to pay contracted-for amounts regardless of amounts from any ERISA plan that may also have been involved \u2014 only Carstens or Williby, not Hu-mana, would have any duty to QIC for amounts other than those dictated by the Plan. Although discrimination against out-of-network providers might be actionable under the AWP in other scenarios, there is no violation as the matter is posited here without the Plan and Carstens or Williby. Unlike the contracts in <em>Blue Cross, Lone Star, </em>or <em>Memorial Hermann, </em>the AWP, as it is used here, is an empty shell without the Plan or the benefits provided to its participants for which payments therefrom were assigned. An analysis by District Judge Lake captured a virtually identical situation involving QIC as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b703-7\">Here, the only action complained of is [the plan administrator\u2019s] failure to reimburse [QIC] for the cost of the drugs supplied to [the beneficiary] under his ERISA-governed Plan, the benefits of which were assigned to [QIC]. The only relationship [the administrator] has with [QIC] is through its administration of the employee welfare benefit plan. As assignee of [the beneficiary\u2019s] benefits under the Plan, [QIC] steps into the beneficiary\u2019s shoes and can only claim as much as [the beneficiary] was entitled to under the Plan. The claim therefore could have been brought under ERISA section 502(a)(1)(B) [and is, thus, completely preempted].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b703-8\"><em>Quality Infusion, </em>2007 WL 760368, at *3 (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b703-9\">The final argument that QIC raises is that notwithstanding any assignment of rights under ERISA \u00a7 502 or its related standing, by assignment or otherwise, QIC\u2019s claims are expressly protected by the unanimous decision by the Supreme Court in <em>Miller, </em>538 U.S. 329, 123 S.Ct. 1471. In <em>Miller, </em>the Court held that a Kentucky statute similar to the AWP at issue in this case was preempted, but was saved from such preemption as a \u201claw ... which regulates insurance\u201d under ERISA \u00a7 514(b)(2)(A). 538 U.S. at 342, 123 S.Ct. 1471. Under <em>Miller, </em>QIC is likely correct that the AWP at issue here would similarly be saved from preemption as presented there. However, the preemption at issue in <em>Miller </em>was conflict preemption under ERISA \u00a7 514, <em>i.e., </em>it covers laws that \u201crelate to\u201d an ERISA plan, whereas the preemption at issue here is complete preemption under ERISA \u00a7 502. The savings clause applies only to the former type, not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"682\">*682</page-number>the latter, while removal applies only to the latter, not the former. As the Court held in <em>Davila:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b704-4\">Under ordinary principles of conflict pre-emption, then, even a state law that can arguably be characterized as \u201cregulating insurance\u201d will be pre-empted if it provides a separate vehicle to assert a claim for benefits outside of, or in addition to, ERISA\u2019s remedial scheme.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b704-5\">542 U.S. at 217-18, 124 S.Ct. 2488.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-6\"><em>Miller </em>seems difficult to ignore given that it involves a virtually identical statute to the cases at hand. However, as the district court found, the issues in <em>Miller </em>were conflict preemption and insurance savings under ERISA \u00a7 514, whereas the issues here are complete preemption and removal under ERISA \u00a7 502.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Moreover, the suit in <em>Miller </em>was a declaratory judgment action filed in federal court <em>ab initio </em>by a group of HMOs for a declaration on the application of the Kentucky statute to their network arrangement generally, <em>see id., </em>538 U.S. at 332-33, 123 S.Ct. 1471, not, as here, the removal of state court actions based, at least in part, on assigned claims for benefits. One might try to infer from the Supreme Court\u2019s silence on the specific issue of complete preemption in <em>Miller </em>that it would never be applicable to the AWP, as QIC has urged. And yet, the emphatic language of <em>Davila </em>suggests that, at least when it comes to the narrow issue of claims for plan benefits, <em>Miller </em>is inapposite as to their removal. <em>See Davi-la, </em>542 U.S. at 217-18, 124 S.Ct. 2488 (distinguishing preemption under ERISA \u00a7\u00a7 502 and 514); <em>see also Prudential Ins. Co. of Am. v. Nat\u2019l Park Med. Ctr., Inc., </em>413 F.3d 897, 913-14 (8th Cir.2005); <em>Ara-na v. Ochsner Health Plan, </em>338 F.3d 433, 439 (5th Cir.2003) (en banc).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b704-9\">(2) Dismissal</p>\n<p id=\"b704-10\">Having found that QIC\u2019s AWP claims are completely preempted under ERISA \u00a7 502, and that QIC has limited itself to such claims and not sought to add any claims under ERISA, both Case # 1 and Case # 2 are not only subject to removal but are also subject to dismissal or judgment on the pleadings. As described above, a motion for judgment on the pleadings under Rule 12(c) is subject to the same standard as a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6). <em>See Johnson, </em>385 F.3d at 529. \u201c[T]he central issue is whether, in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, the complaint states a valid claim for relief.\u201d <em>Hughes, </em>278 F.3d at 420 (internal quotation omitted). Though one might try to infer claims for benefits under ERISA, QIC\u2019s repeated disavowal of such a claim ultimately dooms any such inference. Furthermore, QIC readily admits that both Carstens and Williby assigned their rights to QIC, and in none of its filings here or in the district court has it ever argued that the Plan is not otherwise subject to ERISA. In the end, as QIC practically concedes by dealing almost exclusively with the remand issue at oral argument, a finding of complete pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"683\">*683</page-number>emption in these cases necessitates their dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-5\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b705-6\">For the foregoing reasons, we both AFFIRM the district court\u2019s denial of QIC\u2019s motion to remand in Case # 1 and AFFIRM the district court\u2019s grants of Huma-na\u2019s motions for dismissal or judgment on the pleadings in both Case # 1 and Case #2.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b694-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.

QIC\u2019s motion to remand was filed pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1447. The fact that it was filed outside of the thirty-day period otherwise required by that statute is permitted by its exception for such motions on \"subject matter jurisdiction\u201d grounds. <em>Id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b695-7\">. The district court in Case # 1 treated Hu-mana\u2019s motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6) as a motion for judgment on the pleadings under Rule 12(c), finding the former untimely, <em>see Jones v. Greninger, </em>188 F.3d 322, 324 (5th Cir. 1999) (using similar treatment), while in Case # 2 Humana sought to convert its motion there in like fashion. Both orders, however, granted a \"Motion to Dismiss.\u201d Although the distinction should be noted, calling it dismissal or judgment on the pleadings is immaterial to the analysis herein. <em>See id. </em>(using Rule 12(c), but referring to dismissal interchangeably).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b696-4\">. ERISA \u00a7 502(a)(1)(B) authorizes a participant of an ERISA plan \"to recover benefits due to him under the terms of his plan, to enforce his rights under the terms of the plan, or to clarify his rights to future benefits under the terms of the plan.\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1132(a)(1)(B).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b697-7\">.

At oral argument, QIC's counsel did allude to possible amendments to its claim, but the proposal was limited to non-ERISA claims, which would be subject to dismissal in any event where, as here, a court holds that \"complete preemption\u201d is the rule of the case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b699-7\">. Our holding of complete preemption is limited to the assigned claims for benefits under the Plan at issue pursuant to <em>Davila. </em>Although the line might be a fine one unlikely to ease concerns that ERISA is becoming an \u201cincreasingly tangled ... regime,\u201d <em>Davila, </em>542 U.S. at 222, 124 S.Ct. 2488 (Ginsburg, J\u201e concurring) (internal quotations omitted), our analysis does not suggest that other claims\u2014 e.g., the declaratory judgment in <em>Miller </em>\u2014 are similarly preempted.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b701-6\">. At oral argument, QIC tried to distinguish between section 2(a)(1) of the AWP, which concerns beneficiary access, and section 2(a)(2) of the AWP, which concerns pharmacy access, <em>see </em>Tex. Ins.Code Ann art. 21.52B \u00a7 2(a)(l)-(2), arguing that assignment is irrelevant to claims under the latter section. Whatever merit this argument might have in the abstract, QIC's claims here, and the corresponding relief that is sought, are dependent upon the \"terms and requirements\" of the Plan as they apply to Carstens and Williby. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 2(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b702-5\">. We note that the district court\u2019s decision in <em>Lone Star, </em>557 F.Supp.2d 789, is presently on appeal to this court under Case No. 08-50646.

In <em>Memorial Hospital System, </em>the court distinguished between assigned state law claims for benefits, which it found would be subject to both conflict and complete preemption, and a state law claim for negligent misrepresentation of coverage that did not, in fact, exist, which it found was not subject to any preemption because it did not involve \"the plan\u2019s actual obligations ... and in no way [sought] to modify these obligations.\u201d 904 F.2d at 250.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b703-6\">.

The Supreme Court made this clear in <em>Kentucky Association of Health Plans, Inc. v.

Those issues may include the applicability of ERISA\u2019s \u201cdeemer clause\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and whether the Texas AWP statute could be enforced directly against an insured health care plan even though the Texas statute purports to regulate insurance<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> or whether QIC has an action under ERISA \u00a7 502(a) \u201cfor benefits due, [seeking] only the application of saved state insurance law as a relevant rule of decision in [the] \u00a7 502(a) action.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b706-4\">The pleadings QIC filed in state courts seek payment, based on state law, for the prescription drugs provided to Carstens and Williby. This is a claim for benefits that must be pursued as such under ERISA, even if state law mandates what those benefits must include. QIC\u2019s claims, as currently cast, are preempted.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b705-10\">. Tex.
