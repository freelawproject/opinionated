TYMKOVICH, United States Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b156-20\">Steven L. Williams appeals the denial of his motion to modify his sentence. Proceeding pro se,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> he claims the district court abused its discretion for the following reasons: (1) the district court erroneously concluded a recent amendment to the United States Sentencing Guidelines (USSG) did not authorize the court to modify Williams\u2019s sentence, (2) the district court failed to evaluate whether certain findings made by the original sentencing court were erroneous, and (3) Williams\u2019s sentence violates <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), and <em>Kimbrough v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 558, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b157-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>Having jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and finding no error, we AFFIRM the district court\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-5\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b157-6\">\n<em>Sentencing</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b157-7\">In 1997, Williams pleaded guilty to (1) conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute crack cocaine, and (2) possession with intent to distribute crack cocaine. Prior to sentencing, the probation office prepared a presentence investigation report (PSR). The PSR explained \u201c[djuring the twelve month period ending August 1997, Steve Williams obtained, possessed with intent to distribute or distributed not less than eighteen ounces of [crack cocaine] per month, for a total of 216 ounces or 6.123 kilograms.\u201d PSR at 6, If 12. Based on this quantity of drugs, the PSR recommended a base offense level of 38. <em>See id. </em>at 7, H18 (applying USSG \u00a7 2D1.1(c)(1) (1997)).</p>\n<p id=\"b157-8\">The PSR also recommended no enhancements to the base offense level and a three-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility. Because Williams\u2019s total offense level was 35 and he had a category III criminal history, the PSR calculated a Guidelines range of 210 to 262 months for each count.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-9\">Williams objected to the amount of cocaine the PSR attributed to him. The probation office responded with an addendum setting forth the proof supporting the PSR\u2019s conclusion. In February 1998, the sentencing court adopted the PSR\u2019s factual findings and Guidelines recommendations. The court then sentenced Williams to a term of 210 months imprisonment for each count, with the two terms running concurrently. Williams did not appeal his conviction or sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-13\">\n<em>Motion for Reduction of Sentence</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b157-14\">Ten years later, Williams filed a motion under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) for the modification of his sentence. He argued he was eligible for a reduced sentence pursuant to Amendment 706<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> of the Guidelines, which applies retroactively to sentences involving crack cocaine.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The district court denied Williams\u2019s motion, and this timely appeal follows.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-15\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b157-16\">We review for an abuse of discretion a district court\u2019s decision to deny a reduction in sentence under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>United States v. Dorrough, </em>84 F.3d 1309, 1311 (10th Cir.1996). We review a court\u2019s interpretation of the Guidelines and other legal issues de novo. <em>United States v. Smartt, </em>129 F.3d 539, 540 (10th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b157-17\">A. Application of Amendment 706</p>\n<p id=\"b157-18\">Williams first argues the district court abused its discretion because it concluded USSG Amendment 706 does not authorize the court to reduce his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-19\">According to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2), a \u201ccourt may not modify a term of imprisonment once it has been imposed except ... in the case of a defendant who has been sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission.... \u201d Williams claims the Sentencing Commission retroactively reduced the sentencing range for his offense involving crack cocaine when it passed Amendment 706. As his argument goes, he is therefore eligible for a reduced sentence under \u00a7 3582(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b158-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>Contrary to Williams\u2019s assertion, however, Amendment 706 does not authorize a reduction in his sentence. Amendment 706, which is retroactive to previously imposed sentences,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> modified the drug quantity thresholds in the Drug Quantity Table of USSG \u00a7 201.1(c). When Williams was originally sentenced, the Table indicated that a defendant responsible for <em>1.5 kilograms </em>or more of crack cocaine received a base offense level of 38. <em>See </em>USSG \u00a7 2Dl.l(c)(l) (1997). Now, under Amendment 706, a defendant responsible for <em>k-5 kilograms </em>or more of crack cocaine receives a base offense level of 38. <em>See </em>USSG App. C. Supplement, Amendment 706 (Nov. 1, 2007). Because the original sentencing court concluded Williams was responsible for 6.123 kilograms of crack cocaine, Amendment 706 does not alter Williams\u2019s base offense level; his base offense level remains at 38. Therefore, this amendment does not authorize a court to reduce Williams\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-4\">Because Williams is not eligible for a reduced sentence, we conclude the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-5\">B. Challenge to Drug Quantity</p>\n<p id=\"b158-6\">Williams nonetheless argues that he is eligible for a reduction in his sentence because the sentencing court erred in finding he was responsible for 6.123 kilograms of crack cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-7\">As a threshold matter, Williams failed to raise this argument when he filed his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion in district court,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and therefore we review this issue only for plain error. <em>See United States v. Teague, </em>443 F.3d 1310, 1314 (10th Cir.2006); Fed. R.Crim.P. 52(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b158-10\">Here, we see no error, plain or otherwise, because Williams cannot use \u00a7 3582(c)(2) to collaterally attack his sentence. <em>See Smartt, </em>129 F.3d at 542-43 (holding district court does not have jurisdiction under \u00a7 3582 to consider collateral sentencing issues). A collateral attack \u201ccomplaints] about the substance of, or proceedings that determined, a defendant\u2019s original sentence or conviction.\u201d <em>United States v. Chavez-Salais, </em>337 F.3d 1170, 1172 (10th Cir.2003). In contrast, \u00a7 3582(c)(2) only gives district courts the authority \u201cto modify a sentence based on events occurring <em>after </em>the original sentence was imposed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added); <em>see also United States v. Torres-Aquino, </em>334 F.3d 939, 941 (10th Cir.2003) (describing the difference between a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion and a collateral attack). By challenging the quantity of drugs calculated by the sentencing court, Williams is attempting to use his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion as a vehicle to challenge the substance of, or the proceedings that determined, his original sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-12\">Because the district court lacks jurisdiction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) to consider this collateral attack, we conclude the district court did not err in denying Williams\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-13\">C. <em>Booker </em>and <em>Kimbrough</em></p>\n<p id=\"b158-14\">Williams also argues the district court\u2019s denial of his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion violates <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), and <em>Kimbrough v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 558, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b158-17\">We rejected a similar argument in <em>United States v. Price, </em>438 F.3d 1005 (10th Cir.2006). As we explained, \u201ceven if <em>Book</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>er could be read to be an implicit lowering of [a defendant\u2019s] sentencing range, \u00a7 8582(c)(2) only expressly allows a reduction where the Sentencing Commission, not the Supreme Court, has lowered the range. We therefore agree with the district court that <em>Booker </em>does not provide a basis for a sentence reduction under \u00a7 3582(c).\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1007. The Sentencing Commission has not lowered the range that applies to Williams sentence. Thus, because <em>Booker </em>\u2014 and by extension <em>Kim-brough </em>\u2014 does not provide a basis for a sentence reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2), we conclude the district court did not abuse its discretion by denying Williams\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-5\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b159-6\">For the reasons set forth above, we AFFIRM the district court\u2019s order denying Williams\u2019s motion for modification of his sentence. We DENY Williams\u2019s motion for extension of time to file an untimely reply brief.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b156-13\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata and collateral estoppel.
