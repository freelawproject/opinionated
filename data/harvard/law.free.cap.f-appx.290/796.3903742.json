This court finds that the district court\u2019s dismissal of Rittner\u2019s complaint was proper, as Rittner previously filed more than three lawsuits that were dismissed on the grounds that they were frivolous, malicious, or failed to state a claim upon which relief may be granted <em>and </em>there is no suggestion that Rittner \u201cis under imminent danger of serious physical injury.\u201d We therefore affirm the district court\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-9\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b819-10\">Rittner, an Ohio prisoner, filed a <em>pro se </em>action against defendants-appellants pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 on August 14, 2006. On September 28, 2006, finding that on at least five prior occasions Rittner filed civil actions that failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted, the district court issued an opinion and order dismissing Rittner\u2019s complaint pursuant to 28 U.S.C.1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b819-11\">Rittner now appeals that dismissal, contending that the district court incorrectly found that he was not in imminent danger of serious physical injury. Rittner also contends that some or all of his prior actions were improperly dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-15\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b819-16\">28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g) prohibits a prisoner from bringing a civil action or appeal if the prisoner has \u201cthree strikes.\u201d The statute reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b819-17\">In no event shall a prisoner bring a civil action or appeal a judgment in a civil action or proceeding under this section if the prisoner has, on 3 or more prior occasions, while incarcerated or detained in any facility, brought an action or appeal in a court of the United States that was dismissed on the grounds that it is frivolous, malicious, or fails to state a claim upon which relief may be granted, unless the prisoner is under imminent danger of serious physical injury.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b819-18\">28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). Thus under the statute, there is an exception to the three strikes rule where the prisoner alleges that he or she is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b819-19\">The allegations in Rittner\u2019s complaint do not warrant application of the imminent danger exception in \u00a7 1915(g). While the Sixth Circuit has not defined the term \u201cimminent danger\u201d for purposes of this section, other Circuits have held that to meet the requirement, the threat or prison condition \u201cmust be real and proximate\u201d and the danger of serious physical injury must exist at the time the complaint is filed. <em>See, e.g., Ciarpaglini v. Saini, </em>352 F.3d 328, 330 (7th Cir.2003); <em>Abdul-Akbar v. McKelvie, </em>239 F.3d 307, 313 (3d Cir. 2001) (en banc). Thus a prisoner\u2019s assertion that he or she faced danger in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"798\">*798</page-number>past is insufficient to invoke the exception. <em>Id. </em>Other Circuits also have held that district courts may deny a prisoner leave to proceed pursuant to \u00a7 1915(g) when the prisoner\u2019s claims of imminent danger are \u201cconclusory or ridiculous,\u201d <em>Ciarpaglini, </em>352 F.3d at 331, or are \u201c \u2018clearly baseless\u2019 (i.e. are fantastic or delusional and rise to the level of \u2018irrational or wholly incredible).\u2019 \u201d <em>Gibbs v. Cross, </em>160 F.3d 962, 967 (3d Cir.1998) (quoting <em>Denton v. Hernandez, </em>504 U.S. 25, 33, 112 S.Ct. 1728, 1733, 118 L.Ed.2d 340 (1992)).</p>\n<p id=\"b820-4\">In his complaint, Rittner alleged that the defendants are preventing him from using the prison law library and from obtaining legal assistance and materials, have not properly processed his grievances, and have subjected him to threats and intimidation. Rittner contended that insufficient access to the law library and legal assistance and materials hindered his ability to file and/or prosecute certain lawsuits. There is no indication that Rittner faces imminent physical peril as a result of his alleged inability to file and/or prosecute lawsuits. While Rittner also alleged that he has been intimidated and threatened if he does not stop filing grievances, the examples he provided of such \u201cthreats\u201d and \u201cintimidation\u201d either do not constitute threats of physical injury,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> are described with insufficient facts and detail to establish that he is in danger of imminent physical injury,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> or are \u201cirrational or wholly incredible.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b820-11\">As indicated previously, Rittner also contends that some or all of the prior actions on which the district judge based his \u201cthree strikes\u201d finding were improperly dismissed. The issue of whether Rittner\u2019s earlier cases were correctly dismissed, however, is not within the purview of this appeal and Rittner never appealed those decisions directly.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-12\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b820-13\">In summary, we find that the district court properly determined that Rittner was subject to the three strikes rule and that his complaint failed to suggest that he was \u201cunder imminent danger of serious physical injury.\u201d Therefore, we AFFIRM the district court\u2019s order dismissing Ritt-ner\u2019s complaint pursuant to \u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b820-5\">. For example, Rittner alleged that the following response to one of his grievances constituted a threat and intimidation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b820-6\">The CCNO [Corrections Center of Northwest Ohio] Executive Director is not here to be your legal assistant. You are to work through your Case Manager and Ms. Sham-barger as I have directed you in the past. This is frivolous. You are abusing the grievance procedures and my time. Cease and desist.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b820-7\">(Dist. Ct. Doc. 1, H 47, quoting Ex. 15.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b820-8\">. For example, Rittner alleged: \u201cIn considering the totality of the facts and information g[ ]athered by Plaintiff he had good reason to fear for his life. The intimidation was incredible. All the inmates in the unit were w[e]ll aware of the threats received from Dennis and his staff.\u201d (Dist. Ct. Doc. 1, H 49.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b820-16\">. For example, Rittner claimed that \"the continued responses to his grievances\u201d (i.e. denials, that his grievances are frivolous, and the he must stop abusing the grievance process) \"lead [him] to fear for his life.\u201d (Dist. Ct. Doc. 1, 1148.) Rittner also alleged that a private investigator working for him \"firmly warned [him] of the threats against him made by Dennis\u201d and advised him: \"YOU NEED TO STOP MAKING COMPLAINTS, YOU ARE GOING TO GET HURT.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>11 62.)</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
