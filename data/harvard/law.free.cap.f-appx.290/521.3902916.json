(\u201cRapidigm\u201d) on all three of her claims. Her claims included: (1) gender discrimination under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2000e-2 <em>et seq. </em>(\u201cTitle VII\u201d) and the Pennsylvania Human Relations Act, 43 Pa. Cons.Stat. Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 951 <em>et seq. </em>(\u201cPHRA\u201d); (2) retaliation for protected conduct under Title VII and the PHRA; and (3) wrongful discharge under state law. For the reasons set forth below, we will affirm the order of the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-11\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-12\">We write exclusively for the parties, who are familiar with the factual context and legal history of this case. Therefore, we will set forth only those facts necessary to our analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-13\">In October 1998, Rapidigm hired Martinez, an attorney, as its Manager of Immigration Services. In this position, she was responsible for ensuring that Rapidigm was in compliance with federal immigration laws and regulations. Initially, she oversaw Rapidigm\u2019s participation in the federal green card program, which allows foreign nationals to acquire permanent residency status in the United States. In March 2000, at her request, she also became responsible for Rapidigm\u2019s participation in the federal H-1B program, which allows foreign nationals to remain in the United States to work on a temporary basis.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b544-14\">In August 2000, Martinez sent two emails to Rapidigm\u2019s Chief Executive Officer, Lew Wheeler, in which she expressed her view that the H-1B program was in full compliance. Nevertheless, everyone\u2014 Martinez, Wheeler, and her direct supervisor, Ravi Amble \u2014 agreed that Rapidigm needed to hire someone to manage the H-1B program, particularly due to the extensive demands on Martinez. Rapidigm hired John Tatalovich, who had previously worked as an outside consultant for Rapi-digm on the H-1B program. It announced that he would begin working on September 11, 2000. Martinez did not agree with the decision to hire Tatalovich.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-15\">On September 1, 2000, Martinez sent an email to all of Rapidigm\u2019s recruiters and Human Resources personnel, informing them that \u201cin the interim\u201d until Tatalovich <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>started, they should forward any correspondence regarding H-1B petitions to the paralegal on the \u201cH team,\u201d not to her or her assistant. In addition, she copied the email to Wheeler, Amble, and Paul Freu-denberg, Rapidigm\u2019s President. Amble called Martinez, and the two had a heated exchange. Amble told Martinez that Rapi-digm would not be implementing her plan for compliance with the H-1B program \u2014 a \u201chomebasing\u201d program, in which consultants would be \u201chomebased\u201d at a location for at least one day to ensure the accuracy of the H-1B petition. Martinez informed Amble that she would no longer sign H-1B petitions because she could not verify their accuracy, and she did not want to perjure herself. She further stated that, if she learned of fraudulent activity in the future, she \u201cmay have a legal duty to report that.\u201d With regard to signing the H-1B petitions, he responded that she should \u201ctow [sic] the line,\u201d and she was being \u201cinsubordinate.\u201d Finally, he asked her, \u201cwho did [she] think [she was], ... the Queen?\u201d Later in the day, both Wheeler and Freudenberg told Martinez that she should not sign any petitions, and she testified that she was never again asked to sign petitions.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-5\">On September 8, 2000, Martinez received an email from the Director of Human Resources, Coleen Sullivan, informing her that several employees had complained of a remark Martinez made during a meeting on August 81, 2000. Sullivan asked Martinez to refrain from similar conduct in the future. In response, Martinez stated that she was unaware that she had made an offensive comment. She then sent a second email to Sullivan, in which she filed a formal complaint against Amble based on their telephone conversation.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-6\">Sullivan responded to Martinez on September 27, 2000. She informed Martinez that the complaint against Martinez stemmed from her \u201creference to the office space as being akin to an environment where a female member of [Martinez\u2019s] staff could perform \u2018lap dances\u2019 to a male member of the staff allowing him to place bills \u2018in her g-string.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> She further stated that Martinez\u2019s discussion with Amble around the same time did not influence the report, which Martinez had opined in her complaint against Amble. Finally, Sullivan stated that she had investigated the conversation with Amble, and she encouraged Martinez to report any future incidents.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-9\">Two days later, Martinez filed a \u201cformal complaint\u201d against one of her colleagues, Mark Faurie, based on two comments he made during the month of September. On one occasion, Faurie commented that Martinez was \u201cenforcing [her] Second Amendment rights ... the right to bare arms,\u201d referring to her sleeveless shirt. On another occasion, Faurie responded to Martinez\u2019s assistant\u2019s complaint of fatigue by stating that, \u201cif [he] had known that [Rapi-digm would] be hiring such good-looking women, [he] would have kept the couch.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b545-10\">In February 2001, Rapidigm began examining the efficiency of its Immigration Department and concluded that it was not running as efficiently as possible due to the separation of the green card and H-1B groups. In May 2001, it sought a \u201cRequest for Proposal\u201d from immigration attorneys to determine alternate ways in which to meet its needs and comply with the immigration laws. Reed Smith LLP (\u201cReed Smith\u201d) submitted a proposal, suggesting (1) outsourcing all work; or (2) retaining five or six paralegals who would work under the oversight of attorneys at Reed Smith. It further suggested reorganizing the green card section first, and then turning the focus to the H-1B section.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>On August 1, 2001, Rapidigm terminated Martinez (as well as three other employees of the green card section).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> On June 20, 2002, Martinez instituted this litigation in the District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania, asserting three claims: (1) gender discrimination under Title VII and the PHRA based on a hostile work environment and her termination; (2) retaliation under Title VII and the PHRA; and (3) wrongful discharge under state law. Rapidigm filed a motion for summary judgment on all three of these claims. On March 29, 2007, the District Court granted the motion for summary judgment in favor of Rapidigm. Martinez filed this timely appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-5\">The District Court had jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1331 and 1367(a), and we have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We exercise plenary review over a District Court\u2019s decision to grant a motion for summary judgment, viewing the facts in the light most favorable to the non-moving party. <em>Moore v. City of Phila., </em>461 F.3d 331, 340 (3d Cir. 2006). Summary judgment is proper if \u201cthere is no genuine issue as to any material fact, and ... the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b546-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-7\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-8\">Martinez argues that the District Court erred in granting summary judgment in favor of Rapidigm on her gender discrimination claims. First, she argues that she could demonstrate, as a matter of law, that Rapidigm violated Title VII because its hostile work environment constituted gender discrimination. For Martinez to succeed on her claim, she must demonstrate that: \u201c(1) [she] suffered intentional discrimination because of [her] sex, (2) the discrimination was pervasive and regular, (3) the discrimination detrimentally affected [her], (4) the discrimination would detrimentally affect a reasonable person of the same sex in that position, and (5) the existence of respon-deat superior liability.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>Weston v. Pennsylvania, </em>251 F.3d 420, 426 (3d Cir. 2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b546-11\">For the purposes of this analysis, we will assume that any discrimination Martinez suffered occurred \u201cbecause of\u2019 her gender, and thus, we must examine whether, under the totality of the circumstances, the alleged harassment was sufficiently severe or pervasive to constitute a hostile work environment. <em>See Jensen v. Potter, </em>435 F.3d 444, 452 (3d Cir.2006). In doing so, we consider the following factors to determine if the harassment was sufficiently severe and pervasive: \u201cthe frequency of the discriminatory conduct; its severity; whether it is physically threatening or humiliating, or a mere offensive utterance; and whether it unreasonably interferes with an employee\u2019s work performance.\u201d <em>Harris v. Forklift Sys., Inc., </em>510 U.S. 17, 23, 114 S.Ct. 367, 126 L.Ed.2d 295 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b546-12\">Martinez asserts that the harassment she endured during her three-year tenure at Rapidigm consisted of the following: on one occasion, Amble berated her on the telephone for twenty minutes during which he asked her if she thought she was \u201cthe Queen\u201d; Faurie\u2019s comments regarding her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>right to \u201cbare arms\u201d and the couch; she was initially not invited to attend a conference in Las Vegas, Nevada (but after asking, she received an invitation and went to the conference); she overheard comments of a sexual nature about another female attorney at a Christmas party; and a few other similar comments. However, the events she alleges do not go beyond \u201c[occasional insults, teasing, or episodic instances of ridieulef, which] are not enough.\u201d <em>Jensen, </em>435 F.3d at 451. Therefore, we conclude that she did not suffer severe and pervasive harassment. <em>See Jensen, </em>435 F.3d at 452 (concluding that severe and pervasive harassment existed due to the \u201cpounding regularity\u201d of \u201cretaliatory insults two to three times per week for 19 months,\u201d physical threats, and property damage to the plaintiffs vehicle).</p>\n<p id=\"b547-5\">Moreover, Martinez cannot demonstrate that she subjectively perceived the work environment at Rapidigm as hostile or abusive due to her own conduct. The District Court succinctly described Martinez\u2019s conduct while at Rapidigm: \u201c[s]he used words like \u2018bitch\u2019 to describe herself in emails, mentioned the potential for a \u2018lap dance\u2019 in public, placed a colleague\u2019s picture on an internet dating site, and sent explicit, obscene and shocking email correspondence of a sexual nature to colleagues within the company.\u201d We further note that this shocking email correspondence did not consist of one or two email forwards of a questionable nature, but instead constitutes over one-hundred fifty pages of this record on appeal and contains explicit words and images. Where the plaintiff contributes the same type of conduct of which he or she is complaining to the employer\u2019s work environment to the degree that Martinez has, we conclude, as a matter of law, that the plaintiff would not find the work environment hostile or abusive.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Therefore, Martinez could not demonstrate a prima facie case for her hostile work environment claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-9\">Second, Martinez argues that she could demonstrate, as a matter of law, that Rapidigm violated Title VII by terminating her due to her gender. Martinez meets the requirements for her prima facie case under the burden-shifting test applicable in Title VII cases because (1) she is a woman, and thus, a member of a protected class (gender); (2) she was qualified for the position she held; (3) Rapidigm terminated her position; and (4) Rapidigm \u201cretained employees who do not belong to the protected class.\u201d <em>Tomasso v. Boeing Co., </em>445 F.3d 702, 706 n. 4 (3d Cir.2006). In turn, Rapidigm met its burden of production in establishing a \u201clegitimate, nondiscriminatory reason\u201d for terminating Martinez\u2019s position. <em>See McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, </em>411 U.S. 792, 802, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 36 L.Ed.2d 668 (1973). That is, Rapidigm sought a proposal to run its Immigration Department more effectively, and attorneys from Reed Smith suggested reorganizing the department so that its attorneys oversaw the work of five or six paralegals.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-10\">Thus, the issue is whether Martinez demonstrated \u201cby a preponderance of the evidence that the legitimate reasons offered by the defendant were not its true reasons, but were a pretext for discrimination.\u201d <em>Reeves v. Sanderson Plumbing Prods., Inc., </em>530 U.S. 133, 143, 120 S.Ct. 2097, 147 L.Ed.2d 105 (2000). To do so, Martinez must present evidence from which a reasonable factfinder could infer that the reason was \u201ca post hoc fabrication\u201d or \u201cdid not actually motivate the employment action.\u201d <em>Fuentes v. Perskie, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>32 F.3d 759, 764 (3d Cir.1994) (internal citation omitted). Martinez points to Wheeler\u2019s statement that he and Amble made the decision to terminate her, that Tatalovich was not terminated the same day she was, the \u201congoing harassment\u201d discussed above, and petty instances of disparate treatment regarding the mail, supplies, space heaters, and new chairs. She also alleges that Rapidigm treated the complaint she filed against Amble differently than it did the complaint filed against her for the \u201clap dance\u201d comment. However, we conclude that these instances do not demonstrate \u201csuch weaknesses, implausibilities, inconsistencies, incoherencies, or contradictions\u201d that a reasonable factfin-der could find that Rapidigm\u2019s decision to terminate her was a pretext for gender discrimination against her. <em>Fuentes, </em>32 F.3d at 764.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-4\">Therefore, the District Court did not err in granting summary judgment in favor of Rapidigm on her Title VII and PHRA claims for gender discrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-5\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-6\">Martinez also argues that the District Court erred in granting summary judgment in favor of Rapidigm on her claim of retaliatory discharge in violation of Title VII. For Martinez to establish her prima facie for this claim, she must demonstrate that: (1) she engaged in protected conduct; (2) Rapidigm took an adverse employment action against her; and (3) a causal link exists between her protected conduct and the adverse employment action. <em>See Moore, </em>461 F.3d at 341. The burden-shifting framework again applies, and Rapidigm must present a legitimate, non-diseriminatory reason for its decision, which as we have decided above, it has. <em>See id. </em>Thus, Martinez must also demonstrate pretext, that is, she \u201cmust be able to convince the factfinder both that the employer\u2019s proferred explanation was false, and that retaliation was the real reason for the adverse employment action.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 342 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b548-8\">Martinez claims that Rapidigm terminated her because she reported Amble\u2019s and Faurie\u2019s inappropriate conduct. Regardless of whether Martinez can demonstrate that her reports constituted \u201cprotected conduct,\u201d she cannot demonstrate the causal connection between her reports and her termination. To establish a causal connection, she would need to demonstrate either (1) a temporal proximity between the two events that is \u201cunusually suggestive\u201d of retaliation, <em>see Williams v. Phila. Housing Auth. Police Dep\u2019t, </em>380 F.3d 751, 760 (3d Cir.2004); or (2) timing plus other evidence, which generally includes evidence that the employer engaged in a \u201cpattern of antagonism\u201d with the plaintiff, <em>see Robinson v. Se. Pa. Transp. Auth., </em>982 F.2d 892, 895-96 (3d Cir.1993). Approximately eleven months separated Martinez\u2019s report and her termination, and thus, the temporal proximity is not \u201cunusually suggestive\u201d of retaliation. <em>See Williams, </em>380 F.3d at 760 (two months is not \u201cunusually suggestive\u201d). Additionally, the \u201cpattern of antagonism\u201d that Martinez alleges, which essentially amounts to petty intra-office squabbles, does not amount to the type of antagonism we have recognized. <em>See Robinson, </em>982 F.2d at 895 (concluding that a \u201cpattern of antagonism\u201d existed because the employer engaged in a \u201cconstant barrage of written and verbal warnings ..., inaccurate point totalings, and disciplinary action, all of which occurred soon after plaintiffs initial complaints and continued until his discharge\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b548-9\">Moreover, Martinez cannot demonstrate that Rapidigm\u2019s \u201cproferred explanation was false, and that retaliation was the real reason\u201d she was terminated. <em>Moore, </em>461 F.3d at 342. Therefore, the District Court did not err in granting summary judgment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>in favor of Rapidigm on her Title VII and PHRA claims for retaliation.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-5\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-6\">Finally, Martinez argues that the District Court erred in granting summary judgment in favor of Rapidigm on her wrongful discharge claim under Pennsylvania law. In Pennsylvania, the general rule is that an employer may terminate an employee for any reason. <em>See Geary v. U.S. Steel, </em>456 Pa. 171, 319 A.2d 174, 185 (1974). However, Pennsylvania courts have recognized a public policy exception to this rule. <em>See, e.g., Shick v. Shirey, </em>456 Pa.Super. 668, 691 A.2d 511, 516 (1997). In predicting how the Pennsylvania Supreme Court would extend this rule, we have examined a Pennsylvania Superior Court decision that \u201crecognized three limited circumstances\u201d of the public policy exception, which include:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b549-7\">\u201cAn employer (1) cannot require an employee to commit a crime [and fire the employee for refusing to do so], (2) cannot prevent an employee from complying with a statutorily imposed duty, and (3) cannot discharge an employee when specifically prohibited from doing so by statute.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b549-8\"><em>Fraser v. Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co., </em>352 F.3d 107, 111 (3d Cir.2003) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b549-9\">Martinez asserts that Rapidigm terminated her because she refused to sign the H-1B petitions, and if she had signed these petitions, she would have violated the Pennsylvania Rules of Professional Conduct and perjury laws. She also asserts that Rapidigm terminated her because she threatened Rapidigm that, if she learned of any unlawful conduct, she would have a duty to report it. We agree with the District Court that where an employer terminates an attorney for acting in accordance with the Rules of Professional Conduct, Pennsylvania courts would recognize a claim for wrongful discharge in violation of public policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-11\">We further agree with the District Court\u2019s analysis that Martinez cannot demonstrate these three limited exceptions. First, Rapidigm did not require Martinez to violate the Rules of Professional Conduct or perjury laws. Instead, both Wheeler and Freudenberg instructed her not to sign anything that made her uncomfortable \u2014 even petitions that were lawful. Moreover, even though Amble instructed her to sign petitions (prior to hearing from Wheeler and Freudenberg), she has not demonstrated that any of the petitions she would have signed were unlawful. Her speculation as to their lawfulness is insufficient for us to conclude that any petitions she would have signed would have violated the Rules of Professional Conduct or perjury laws. Thus, Martinez cannot demonstrate that Rapidigm terminated her for refusing to violate the Rules of Professional Conduct or perjury laws. Additionally, Martinez did not report Rapidigm for engaging in unlawful activity (until after her termination), and thus, she cannot demonstrate that she was terminated for reporting Rapidigm. Finally, Martinez does not advance the third theory.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-12\">Therefore, the District Court did not err in granting summary judgment in favor of Rapidigm on her state law claim for wrongful discharge.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-13\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-14\">For the foregoing reasons, we will affirm the order of the District Court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b544-10\">. Prior to March 2000, Rapidigm used an outside consultant, John Tatalovich, for its work with the H-1B program. However, beginning in September 1999, Martinez refused to work on H-1B petitions unless she had full responsibility for the program.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b545-7\">. Martinez does not dispute that she made this statement.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b546-9\">. Tatalovich resigned the next day, effective August 15, 2001. In October 2001, at the suggestion of Reed Smith, Rapidigm hired Julie Shymansky as its Director of Operations, Immigration Services. Reed Smith continues to provide oversight to Rapidigm's Immigration Department.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b546-14\">. The analysis is the same under Title VII and the PHRA. <em>See Weston v. Pennsylvania, </em>251 F.3d 420, 425 n. 3 (3d Cir.2001).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b547-6\">. We reject Martinez\u2019s argument that this conclusion is a credibility determination that only a jury can make.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
