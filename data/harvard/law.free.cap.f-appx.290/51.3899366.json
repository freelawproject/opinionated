We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-4\">First, the district court did not err in denying Gonzalez\u2019s motion to suppress the seized gun. That Officer Garcia asked a few questions of the vehicle\u2019s passengers that went beyond the scope of what was necessary for issuing a citation did not, without more, violate Gonzalez\u2019s Fourth Amendment rights. <em>See Muehler v. Mena, </em>544 U.S. 93, 101, 125 S.Ct. 1465, 161 L.Ed.2d 299 (2005); <em>United States v. Mendez, </em>476 F.3d 1077, 1080 (9th Cir.2007). Moreover, Officer Garcia\u2019s brief and apparently unintentional prolongation of the traffic stop by running the passengers\u2019 names through the \u201cwants and warrants\u201d database was not unreasonable under the circumstances. <em>See United States v. Turvin, </em>517 F.3d 1097, 1103 (9th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b74-5\">Second, Gonzalez concedes that Officer Garcia\u2019s search of the passenger compartment of the vehicle, including the unlocked glove box, was a lawful search incident to the arrest of passenger Rivera under <em>New York v. Belton, </em>453 U.S. 454, 460, 101 S.Ct. 2860, 69 L.Ed.2d 768 (1981). <em>See United States v. Weaver, </em>433 F.3d 1104, 1106 (9th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b74-6\">Third, the district court did not abuse its discretion and did not violate Gonzalez\u2019s rights under the Confrontation Clause by barring Gonzalez from cross-examining government witness Davila. Davila\u2019s cooperation agreement with state authorities concerning an unrelated crime was not relevant to Gonzalez\u2019s federal criminal case. <em>See United States v. James, </em>139 F.3d 709, 713 (9th Cir.1998). Moreover, the fact of Davila\u2019s arrest, combined with her inconsistent testimony as to her knowledge about the gun, left the jury with sufficient information to assess her credibility. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b74-8\">Finally, the district court did not err in enhancing Gonzalez\u2019s offense level under United States Sentencing Guidelines \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(4)(A) on the ground that his prior conviction for residential burglary under section 9A.52.025(1) of the Revised Code of Washington constituted a \u201ccrime of violence.\u201d While a Washington residential burglary conviction is not categorically a \u201cburglary of a dwelling\u201d (and thus a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2(a)(2)), <em>see United States v. Wenner, </em>351 F.3d 969, 972-73 (9th Cir.2003), the district court properly applied the modified categorical approach under <em>Taylor v. United States, </em>495 U.S. 575, 602, 110 S.Ct. 2143, 109 L.Ed.2d 607 (1990), in concluding that Gonzalez\u2019s prior residential burglary conviction did, in fact, constitute a \u201cburglary of a dwelling.\u201d The Information alleged that Gonzalez had \u201centered or remained unlawfully in a dwelling other than a vehicle, located at 480 Coe Road, Wapato, Washington, the residence of Shawn Klingele.\u201d Gonzalez admitted the truthfulness of the allegation in his guilty plea. <em>See United States v. Rodriguez-Rodriguez, </em>393 F.3d 849, 857 (9th Cir. 2005). On the basis of this admission, the district court properly determined that Gonzalez had burglarized a \u201cbuilding or structure\u201d and thus had been convicted of a \u201cburglary of a dwelling.\u201d <em>See United States v. Guerrero-Velasquez, </em>434 F.3d 1193, 1197 (9th Cir.2006). Accordingly, the enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(4)(A) was warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b73-20\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>by 9th Cir.
