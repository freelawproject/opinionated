Stegeman appeals <em>pro se </em>the district court\u2019s dismissal of his action filed pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1983 and 1985(3). Stegeman\u2019s claims arise out of proceedings in the DeKalb County Probate Court that revoked Stegeman\u2019s power of attorney over his elderly aunt, Jean Caffrey; found that Stegeman had engaged in elder abuse and financial fraud; appointed a guardian ad litem for Caffrey; and later, after Caf-frey died, appointed an administrator and probated her estate. Stegeman alleged that numerous state and county entities and officials violated and conspired to violate his due process and equal protection rights during the probate court proceedings.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> After review, we affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b344-13\">First, all of Stegeman\u2019s claims stemming from actions taken prior to December 5, 2004 are barred by Georgia\u2019s two-year personal injury statute of limitations. <em>See Rozar v. Mull\u00eds, </em>85 F.3d 556, 560-61 (11th Cir.1996); O.C.G.A. \u00a7 9-3-33. Furthermore, Stegeman\u2019s arguments that the statute of limitations was tolled are without merit. Thus, Stegeman\u2019s only timely claims are against the Georgia Superior Court, the DeKalb County Probate Court, Probate Judge Jeryl Debra Rosh and De-Kalb County relating to the administration of Caffrey\u2019s estate after December 5, 2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-14\">Second, Stegeman\u2019s claims against the Superior Court and the DeKalb County Probate Court are barred by the Eleventh Amendment. <em>See Kaimowitz v. Florida Bar, </em>996 F.2d 1151, 1155 (11th Cir. 1993) (explaining that actions against state <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>courts are barred by the Eleventh Amendment); Ga. Const, art. VI, \u00a7 1, H 1 (vesting judicial power of the state in, <em>inter alia, </em>superior courts, state courts and probate courts).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b345-5\">Third, Judge Rosh is entitled to judicial immunity. <em>See Mireles v. </em>Waco, 502 U.S. 9, 9-12, 112 S.Ct. 286, 287-88, 116 L.Ed.2d 9 (1991) (concluding that judicial immunity can be overcome only if the actions are not taken in the judge\u2019s judicial capacity or if the actions, though judicial in nature, are taken in the complete absence of jurisdiction). Judge Rosh\u2019s only alleged action occurring after December 5, 2004 was her ruling on the petition for discharge filed by the Temporary Administrator of Caffrey\u2019s estate, which was taken in her judicial capacity as a probate judge and within the jurisdiction of the probate court. <em>See </em>O.C.G.A. \u00a7 15-9-30(a) (conferring upon probate courts subject matter jurisdiction over, <em>inter alia, </em>the probating of wills and all controversies regarding the administration of an estate).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b345-6\">Fourth, Stegeman failed to state a \u00a7 1983 claim against DeKalb County because his complaint did not allege any claimed constitutional violations that were the result of an official policy or custom.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-11\"><em>See Monell v. Dep\u2019t of Soc. Servs., </em>436 U.S. 658, 690-91, 98 S.Ct. 2018, 2035-36, 56 L.Ed.2d 611 (1978) (concluding that to state a \u00a7 1983 claim against a municipality, the plaintiff must allege that the constitutional deprivation was pursuant to a governmental policy or custom).</p>\n<p id=\"b345-12\">Finally, the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Stegeman\u2019s motion for default judgment.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Although the State Court of Georgia and the DeKalb County Solicitor\u2019s Office did not file an answer or other responsive pleading, Stegeman\u2019s complaint did not present a sufficient basis for a default judgment against them. <em>See Nishimatsu Constr. Co. v. Houston Nat\u2019l Bank, </em>515 F.2d 1200, 1206 (5th Cir.1975) (explaining that \u201ca defendant\u2019s default does not in itself warrant the court entering a default judgment,\u201d and that \u201c[tjhere must be a sufficient basis in the pleadings for the judgment entered\u201d).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> From the face of Stegeman\u2019s complaint, it is clear his claims against the State Court of Georgia are barred by the Eleventh Amendment and the claims against the DeKalb County Solicitor\u2019s Office are time-barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-13\">The State of Georgia, the State of Georgia Department of Human Resources, De-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>Kalb County Department of Family and Children Services and the Georgia Superi- or Court (\u201cthe state defendants\u201d) waived service of process pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 4(d) and filed a responsive pleading in the form of a pre-answer motion to dismiss. <em>See </em>Fed. R.Civ.P. 12(b), 55(a). Because the district court granted the state defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss, they were not required to file an answer and were not in default.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b346-4\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the district court\u2019s order granting the defendants\u2019 motions to dismiss and denying Stegeman\u2019s motions for default judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b344-10\">. Stegeman\u2019s complaint also asserted various state law claims, which the district court dismissed without prejudice after declining to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over them. On appeal, Stegeman does not challenge the dismissal of these claims.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b344-11\">. We review <em>de novo </em>a district court's order granting a motion to dismiss. <em>Wagner v. First Horizon Pharm. Corp., </em>464 F.3d 1273, 1276 (1 lth Cir.2006). We reject as meritless Stege-man's argument that the district court should have treated the defendants\u2019 motions to dismiss as summary judgment motions because the district court did not consider matters outside the pleadings. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(d) (requiring a court to treat a Rule 12(b)(6) motion as a summary judgment motion when matters outside the pleadings are considered).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b345-7\">. Stegeman\u2019s argument that Congress abrogated sovereign immunity from claims under the Americans with Disabilities Act (\"ADA\u201d) is unavailing because Stegeman did not assert claims under the ADA. Congress has not abrogated sovereign immunity from claims, such as Stegeman\u2019s, brought under \u00a7\u00a7 1983 and 1985. <em>See Will v. Mich. Dep\u2019t of State Police, </em>491 U.S. 58, 67, 109 S.Ct. 2304, 2310, 105 L.Ed.2d 45 (1989); <em>Fincher v. Fla. Dep\u2019t of Labor &amp; Employment Sec., </em>798 F.2d 1371, 1372 (11th Cir. 1986).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b345-8\">. Stegeman's claim that Judge Rosh presided over a criminal hearing is without merit. Stegeman's complaint alleges that, on June 5, 2002, Judge Rosh found that Stegeman had engaged in elder abuse and financial fraud and revoked his power of attorney over Caf-frey. However, any claims regarding this finding are time-barred. The only timely action relating to Judge Rosh is her ruling on the petition for discharge. Nothing in Stege-man\u2019s complaint suggests the ruling on the petition for discharge was criminal in nature.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b345-15\">. We review for abuse of discretion a district court\u2019s denial of a motion for default judgment. <em>Mitchell v. Brown &amp; Williamson Tobacco Corp., </em>294 F.3d 1309, 1316 (11th Cir. 2002).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b345-16\">. This Court adopted as binding precedent all decisions of the former Fifth Circuit handed down prior to the close of business on September 30, 1981. <em>See Bonner v. City of Prich-ard, </em>661 F.2d 1206, 1209 (11th Cir.1981) <em>(en </em>banc).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b346-14\">. Contrary to Stegeman's assertion, the state defendants\u2019 failure to include the three-initial suffix to the case number on its pleadings, as required by local rule, would not support a default judgment. See Fed.R.Civ.P. 83(a)(2) (prohibiting a local rule imposing form requirements from being enforced in a manner that causes a party to lose rights unless the violation is willful). Additionally, there is no evidence in the record that attorney Matthew LaVallee did not represent the state defendants or improperly filed pleadings on their behalf.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
