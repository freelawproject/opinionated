On appeal we affirmed, rejecting Caldwell\u2019s argument that the sentence was unreasonable because the district court erroneously concluded that it lacked discretion to vary below the advisory Guidelines range based on the sentencing differential between crack and powder cocaine offenses. The United States Supreme Court vacated our judgment and remanded for further consideration in light of <em>Kimbrough v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 558, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b986-19\">We review the sentence for reasonableness, first ensuring that the district court did not commit a significant procedural error. <em>See United States v. Kowal, </em>527 F.3d 741, 747 (8th Cir.2008). <em>Kimbrough </em>instructs that a district court may consider the crack/powder cocaine sentencing disparity in determining whether a within-Guidelines sentence is appropriate. <em>See </em>128 S.Ct. at 564, 575. Consequently, it was a significant procedural error for the district court to conclude it lacked such discretion. <em>See United States v. Tabor, </em>531 F.3d 688, 692 (8th Cir.2008) (significant procedural error occurs if district court fails to understand scope of its authority and discretion at sentencing). This error was not harmless because it is not clear from the sentencing record whether the court would have varied downward based on the crack/powder cocaine disparity if it had known it could do so. <em>See id. </em>(error is harmless only if appeals court is convinced that error did not affect district court\u2019s sentencing conclusion); <em>see also United States v. Thomas, </em>524 F.3d 855, 860 (8th Cir.2008) (remanding for resen-tencing because it was unclear from sentencing record whether district court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"965\">*965</page-number>would have granted defendant\u2019s request for downward variance based on crack/powder cocaine disparity if it had known it could so).</p>\n<p id=\"b987-5\">Accordingly, we vacate Caldwell\u2019s sentence and remand for resentencing in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
