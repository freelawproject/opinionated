Stoyanov appeals the district court\u2019s order dismissing his claims under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2000e to 2000e-17 (2000), the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967, as amended, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 621 to 634 (2000), the Whisle-blower Protection Act, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1214, 1221 and 2302 (2000), and various state law tort claims, as well as its order denying his motions for reconsideration, for judgment, and to compel certification of the content of Defendants\u2019 correspondence. We dismiss Stoyanov\u2019s appeal in part because he failed to timely appeal the district court\u2019s order dismissing his claims, and affirm the district court\u2019s order denying his motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-16\">When the United States or its officer or agency is a party to a civil suit, parties are accorded sixty days from the day judgment is entered to file a notice of appeal, <em>see </em>Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(1)(B), unless the district court extends the appeal period under Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(5), or reopens the appeal period under Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(6). This appeal period is \u201cmandatory and jurisdictional.\u201d <em>Browder v. Director, Dep\u2019t of Corrections, </em>434 U.S. 257, 264, 98 S.Ct. 556, 54 L.Ed.2d 521 (1978) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). <em>Accord Bowles v. Russell, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 2360, 168 L.Ed.2d 96 (2007). Stoyanov\u2019s notice of appeal, filed more than sixty days after the district court entered its order granting Defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss, was untimely filed, regardless of when Stoyanov received notice of entry of the district court\u2019s order. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 77(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b659-19\">Moreover, we find that Stoyanov\u2019s motion for reconsideration, which was filed more than one month after the district court\u2019s order granting Defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss and asked that the district court extend Stoyanov\u2019s time to file a motion for reconsideration, did not toll the time for filing a notice of appeal of the underlying order because it was not a timely filed Fed.R.Civ.P. 59(e) motion. <em>See Panhorst v. United States, </em>241 F.3d 367, 369-73 (4th Cir.2001). Although the district court did not explicitly construe Stoyanov\u2019s motion for reconsideration as a Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b) motion, we nonetheless find that Stoyanov\u2019s motion failed to establish he was entitled to Rule 60(b) relief.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b659-20\">Based on the foregoing, we dismiss Stoyanov\u2019s appeal of the district court\u2019s order granting Defendants\u2019 motion to dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number>miss and affirm the district court\u2019s denial of Stoyanov\u2019s motions for reconsideration, for judgment, and to compel. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-4\">\n<em>DISMISSED IN PART; AFFIRMED IN PART.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b659-14\"> Because Stoyanov\u2019s Rule 60(b) motion was not the functional equivalent of a notice of appeal, <em>see </em>Fed. R.App. P. 3, we decline to construe the motion as a notice of appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
