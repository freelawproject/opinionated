We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-23\">In deciding whether to award fees, the district court appropriately and explicitly considered all the relevant factors referenced in <em>Jackson v. Axton, </em>25 F.3d 884, 890 (9th Cir.1994), <em>overruled on other grounds by Fogerty v. Fantasy, Inc., </em>510 U.S. 517, 531-32, 114 S.Ct. 1023, 127 L.Ed.2d 455 (1994). In so doing, the district court concluded that Cadkin\u2019s claims were frivolous, his continued pursuit of the case suggested bad faith, and because he did not own any interest in the copyrights at issue his arguments were objectively unreasonable. The record adequately supports these conclusions. As the district court said, \u201cPlaintiff did not have standing to bring the claim and he <em>knew </em>he did not have standing, yet brought the claim anyway.\u201d We find ample support for this particular conclusion in (1) Cadkin\u2019s previous sale of his copyrights to others, (2) his admission of the same, and (3) his submission to the court nevertheless of a claim <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>for relief in his first amended complaint alleging a copyright violation \u2014 which he now concedes \u201cmay have been an error in hindsight....\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b82-4\">As to the propriety of the amount of the award, we note that the court carefully examined Defendants\u2019 request. Spotting \u201cblock billing\u201d and remarking on the problems created with this inflationary practice, the district court reduced block-billed hours by 20%. The reduced billing rates were supported by sworn affidavits which Cadkin made no effort to rebut. Given the record plus the court\u2019s own knowledge of the legal rates charged within the Los Angeles legal community, the court determined that the requested hourly rates were reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b81-17\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
