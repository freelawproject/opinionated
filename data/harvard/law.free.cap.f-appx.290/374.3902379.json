Although the district court denied relief, it granted a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>certificate of appealability on several of Raposa claims of asserted error: specifically, that the prosecutor\u2019s summation violated Raposa\u2019s due process rights, as did aspects of the prosecutor\u2019s cross-examination and the state court\u2019s subsequent admission of allegedly prejudicial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-5\">The Commonwealth, in turn, argues that Raposa failed to exhaust her federal constitutional claims in the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court (\u201cSJC\u201d). In the alternative, the Commonwealth argues that the SJC\u2019s decision was neither contrary to, nor an unreasonable application of, clearly established federal law.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-6\">The district court found that Raposa had exhausted her federal claims below, but that there was no error in the SJC\u2019s decision warranting a grant of the writ. We have given Raposa\u2019s arguments careful consideration but in the end see no reason to differ with, or add to, either part of the district court\u2019s thoughtful and well-reasoned opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
