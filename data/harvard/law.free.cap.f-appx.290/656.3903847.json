(StarTran) appeals the decision of the Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission (the Commission) holding that it does not qualify for the political subdivision exemption from the Occupational Safety and Health Act (the OSH Act), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 652(5) and, as a result, must comply with a citation and penalty issued against it. Section 652(5) provides that \u201c[t]he term <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>\u2018employer\u2019 ... does not include ... any ... political subdivision of a State,\u201d but the OSH Act does not define \u201cpolitical subdivision.\u201d For the reasons stated below, we affirm in part and in part remand to the Commission for reconsideration in light of this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-4\">FACTS AND PROCEEDINGS BELOW</p>\n<p id=\"b680-5\">Capital Metropolitan Transit Authority (Capital Metro) is a regional area public transit authority in Austin, Texas. It was established about 1985 under Texas law (then Tex.Rev.Civ. Stats art. 1118x), operates under Chapter 451 of the Texas Transportation Code and is a political subdivision of State of Texas. See Tex. Transportation Code \u00a7 451.052(a)(1). In December 1991 Capital Metro created StarTran, a Texas nonprofit corporation incorporated under the Texas Non-Profit Corporation Act (Art. 1396-1.01-11.01, Tex.Rev.Civ.Stats.), in order to provide transportation services in Austin while complying with both the Federal Transportation Act and Texas law. The Federal Transportation Act conditions federal funding for transit authorities like Capital Metro on the continuation of existing collective bargaining with employees, while Texas law prohibits public employees from engaging in collective bargaining. <em>See </em>49 U.S.C. \u00a7 5333(b); Tex. Gov\u2019t Code Ann. \u00a7 617.002 (Vernon 2004).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b681-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>StarTran has characteristics of both a public and a private entity. A few weeks after it was created by Capital Metro, StarTran and Capital Metro, in December 1991, entered into a written \u201cAgreement for Provision of Employee Support Services\u201d in which Capital Metro designated and appointed StarTran as its \u201cagent to provide Employee Support Services.\u201d The agreement has been amended twice, in 1993 and again in 1997. StarTran\u2019s duties under the agreement include employing workers for the area mass transit system and negotiating collective bargaining agreements with the employees\u2019 union. StarTran has the exclusive right to enter collective bargaining agreements, but the agreements must be approved by the Capital Metro board. Capital Metro has approved every bargaining agreement that StarTran has presented to it.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-5\">The Agreement for the Provision of Employee Support Services, states that Star-Tran will \u201cretain absolute and real day-today control over all matters relating to the terms and conditions of employment, supervision and control of its employees.\u201d Thus, StarTran has authority to hire, fire, promote, and discipline its employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-6\">Capital Metro developed StarTran\u2019s safety program, but StarTran takes a great deal of responsibility in enforcing it. The 1993 amendment to the Agreement reflects that StarTran is responsible for the \u201csafety and other training and claims related services\u201d for its employees. The 1997 amendment added, among other things, language stating that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b681-7\">\u201c... Capital metro shall have no right to supervise or control the duties and activities of StarTran so as to cause a violation of the provisions of Chapter 617 of the Texas Government Code or 49 U.S.C. Section 5333. It is the intent of the pai\u2019ties that, for purposes of Collective Bargaining, StarTran is an independent corporate entity which shall in no way be deemed to be an affiliate, partner, subsidiary, joint venturer, or otherwise under the control of Capital Metro.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b681-9\">Apart from its collective bargaining agreement with the union representing its employees, StarTran does not serve or contract with any entity other than Capital Metro, and Capital Metro serves as its sole source of financing. Capital Metro pays the salaries of StarTran\u2019s board and processes the StarTran paychecks of Star-Tran employees. The buses and vans operated by StarTran employees are owned by Capital Metro, which fixes their routes and schedules. Bus fares paid are collected by StarTran employees but are all fixed by and turned over daily to Capital Metro. Capital Metro also px\u2019ovides StarTran, among other things, with <em>all </em>its funding and office supplies, and the two entities shax-e office space in the same building. StarTran\u2019s <em>only </em>asset is its employees. StarTran employees do not receive the same benefits as public employees like the Capital Metro employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-10\">StarTran has been informally treated as a private entity, not a political subdivision, under the National Labor Relations Act (the NLRA), and StarTran has never challenged or questioned that tx\u2019eatment. The NLRA governs the light of private employees to bargain collectively. <em>See </em>29 U.S.C. \u00a7 151. Like the OSH Act, the NLRA covers \u201cemployers,\u201d but provides that \u201cthe tex-m \u2018employer\u2019 shall not include ... any State or political subdivision thereof ...\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 152(2). Also like the OSH Act, the NLRA contains no definition of \u201cpolitical subdivision.\u201d In <em>NLRB v. Natural Gas Util. Dist. of Hawkins County, Tenn., </em>402 U.S. 600, 91 S.Ct. 1746, 29 L.Ed.2d 206 (1971), the Supreme Court reversed the NLRB\u2019s determination that the Hawkins County, Tennessee, utility District, was not exempt under section <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>152(2) as a political subdivision of Tennessee. The Court noted that the question was one of federal law, <em>id. </em>at 1748-49, and assumed, without deciding, the correctness of the test generally applied by the NLRB in deciding that question, namely whether such entities are ones \u201c \u2018either (1) created directly by the state, so as to constitute departments or administrative arms of the government, or (2) administered by individuals who are responsible to public officials or to the general electorate.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1749. The Court held that as a matter of law the district met the second prong of the NLRB\u2019s test since it was administered by individuals who were responsible to public officials.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>See also Brock v. Chi. Zoological Soc\u2019y (\u201cChicago Zoo\u201d), </em>820 F.2d 909, 910 (7th Cir.1987) (indicating that the test for determining whether an entity is a political subdivision under the OSH Act is \u201cidentical to the formula the National Labor Relations Board has long used to determine whether an entity is a political subdivision exempt from the Board\u2019s jurisdiction under [the NLRA]\u201d). Although StarTran has never disputed NLRA coverage, there has been no formal determination by the National Labor Relations Board (the NLRB) as to whether StarTran qualifies as a political subdivision for NLRA purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-4\">Finally, the StarTran board is appointed and removable by the Capital Metro CEO. Five of the seven Capital Metro board members are elected officials, while two are hired by the board. The Capital Metro board members select and may remove the CEO of Capital Metro. StarTran\u2019s bylaws provide that people who hold certain specified executive positions at Star-Tran will be on the board of directors of that entity. The CEO of Capital Metro appoints the five members of the StarTran board by controlling who holds these specified executive positions. All members of the board of directors of StarTran are at-will employees of StarTran. They report to the CEO of Capital Metro, who can shift them to different positions at StarTran where they will no longer be on the Star-Tran board. Thus, the CEO of Capital Metro, who is subject to the control of elected officials, has the power to appoint and remove StarTran board members.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-7\">On May 9, 2002, OSHA representatives conducted an inspection of StarTran at StarTran\u2019s facility in Austin, Texas. After the inspection, OSHA requested copies of injury and illness data from StarTran pursuant to 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1904.40, and issued StarTran a Citation and Notification of Penalty on July 1, 2002. On July 9, 2002, StarTran indicated that it would not provide these documents to OSHA because it did not consider itself to be covered by the OSH Act. It argued that it does not qualify as an \u201cemployer\u201d as that term is defined in the OSH Act because it is exempt from that definition as a \u201cpolitical subdivision\u201d of Texas. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 652(5).</p>\n<p id=\"b682-8\">The Secretary of Labor (the Secretary) filed a complaint against StarTran on October 8, 2002, to which StarTran responded on October 29, 2002 with a Motion to Dismiss. OSHA cited StarTran for a violation of 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1904.40 based on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>StarTran\u2019s failure to provide the requested records -within four business hours, and proposed a penalty of $500. StarTran contested this citation, but the administrative law judge (ALJ), affirmed the citation and penalty on December 11, 2002. He found that the OSH Act governs StarTran because StarTran is not a political subdivision of the State of Texas and is an employer under section 652(5). StarTran then sought interlocutory review of the ALJ\u2019s order, which the Commission denied on January 22, 2003. The ALJ conducted an evidentiary hearing in Austin on April 24, 2003 regarding the case. The ALJ then entered an undated Decision and Order holding that StarTran was subject to the OSH Act, and the jurisdiction of OSHA. The Commission upheld the ALJ ruling in a two-to-one decision issued September 27, 2006. StarTran timely filed a Petition for Review in this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b683-6\">We limit our discussion to the issues argued on appeal: whether the Commission erred in holding that StarTran should bear the burden of proving its status as a political subdivision under the OSH Act, and whether the Commission erred in holding that StarTran does not qualify as a political subdivision. For the reasons stated below, we affirm the Commission\u2019s decision in part on the burden of proof issue, and remand the case to the Commission for reconsideration in light of this opinion on the issue of whether StarTran is a political subdivision of Texas for OSH Act purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-7\">A. <em>The Political Subdivision Exemption to the OSH Act</em></p>\n<p id=\"b683-8\">The OSH Act is a federal statute created to assure safe working conditions for employees in the United States. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 651(b). It imposes various duties on employers to ensure that they provide a safe work place. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 654(a). An \u201cemployer\u201d under the OSH Act is defined as \u201ca person engaged in a business affecting commerce who has employees, but does not include the United States ... or any State or political subdivision of a State.\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 652(5). Thus, a \u201cpolitical subdivision\u201d of a state is not covered by the OSH Act. This exemption constitutes \u201can accommodation between the [OSH] Act\u2019s general purpose of ensuring a safe workplace and the states\u2019 interest in preserving autonomy in their role as employers.\u201d <em>Chicago Zoo, </em>820 F.2d at 913.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-10\">The term \u201cpolitical subdivision\u201d is not defined in the OSH Act. However, 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1975.5(b), a regulation promulgated by the Secretary of Labor, provides two \u201c[t]ests\u201d for determining whether an entity qualifies as a political subdivision. Under the tests, an entity is a \u201cState or political subdivision thereof\u2019 if it \u201chas been (1) created directly by the State, so as to constitute a department or administrative arm of the government, or (2) administered by individuals who are controlled by public officials and responsible to such officials or to the general electorate.\u201d The regulation goes on to provide \u201cFactors for meeting the tests,\u201d stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b683-11\">\u201cVarious factors will be taken into consideration in determining whether an entity meets the test discussed above. Some examples of these factors are: Are the individuals who administer the entity appointed by a public official or elected by the general electorate? What are the terms and conditions of the appointment? Who may dismiss such individuals and under what procedures? What is the financial source of the salary of these individuals? Does the entity earn a profit? Are such profits treated as revenue? How are the entity\u2019s functions financed? What are the powers of the entity and are they usually characteristic of a government rather than a private instrumentality like the power of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>eminent domain? How is the entity regarded under State and local law as well as under other Federal laws? Is the entity exempted from State and local tax laws? Are the entity\u2019s bonds, if any, tax-exempt? As to the entity\u2019s employees, are they regarded like employees of other State and political subdivisions? What is the financial source of the employee-payroll? How do employee fringe benefits, rights, obligations, and restrictions of the entity\u2019s employees compare to those of the employees of other State and local departments and agencies?\u201d 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1975.5(c).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b684-4\">The regulation further provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b684-5\">\u201cWeight of the factors. The above list of factors is not exhaustive and no factor, isolated from the particular facts of a case, is assigned any particular weight for the purpose of a determination by the Secretary of Labor as to whether a given entity is a \u201cState or political subdivision of a State\u201d and, as such, not subject to the Act as an \u201cemployer.\u201d Each case must be viewed on its merits; and whether a single factor will be decisive, or whether the factors must be viewed in their relationship to each other as part of a sum total, also depends on the merits of each case.\u201d 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1975.5(d).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b684-6\">B. <em>Burden of Proof</em></p>\n<p id=\"b684-7\">The Commission held that StarTran bore the burden of proving that it falls under the political subdivision exception to the OSH Act\u2019s definition of \u201cemployer.\u201d StarTran contends that in proceedings before the ALJ, the parties litigated the issue of whether StarTran was subject to OSHA\u2019s authority under the assumption that it was a jurisdictional issue on which the Secretary bore the burden of proof. Thus, it argues that the Commission should not have addressed this issue because the Secretary did not question the assignment of the burden of in front of the ALJ. StarTran also argues that the Commission erred in concluding that the Secretary did not bear the burden of proof. This court will review the Commission\u2019s legal conclusions regarding the burden of proof to determine if they are \u201carbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(2)(A); <em>See also Trinity Marine Nashville, Inc. v. Occupational Safety and Health Review Comm\u2019n, </em>275 F.3d 423, 427 (5th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b684-9\">StarTran first argues that the Commission should not have addressed the Secretary\u2019s argument that StarTran bore the burden of proof because the Secretary first raised this argument in her Responsive Brief to the Commission, and did not raise it before the ALJ. It contends that because the Secretary indicated that the case involved a jurisdictional issue, she stipulated that she bore the burden of proof because the party asserting subject matter jurisdiction has the burden of proving that it exists. <em>See Peoples Nat\u2019l Bank v. Office of Comptroller of Currency of the United States, </em>362 F.3d 333, 336 (5th Cir. 2004). StarTran also notes that the Secretary never challenged StarTran\u2019s assertion during the hearing in front of the ALJ that the Secretary bore the burden of proof. Because a litigant should not be able to raise new issues on appeal, StarTran suggests that the Secretary waived her argument that StarTran bears the burden of proof. <em>See </em>29 C.F.R. \u00a7 2200.92(c) (\u201cThe Commission will ordinarily not review issues that the [ALJ] did not have the opportunity to pass upon.\u201d). The Secretary argues that the Commission had discretion to address this issue even if neither party raised it in front of the ALJ. She also suggests that the failure to raise this issue did not harm StarTran\u2019s ability to develop its case. Finally, she contends that she had a good reason for failing to raise the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>issue earlier \u2014 she was not aware that it was disputed until she read StarTran\u2019s opening brief for the proceedings in front of the Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-5\">Although the Commission generally does not review issues that the ALJ did not address, it has discretion to do so. 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 2200.92(c). In determining whether to address an issue not raised before the ALJ, the Commission may consider factors such as whether there was good cause for failing to raise the issue earlier, the degree to which the proceedings will be disrupted by raising the issue, whether addressing the issue will injure the adverse party\u2019s ability to raise a claim or defense, and whether considering the new issue would avoid injustice. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b685-6\">In light of 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 2200.92(c), the Commission did not abuse its discretion or act arbitrarily or capriciously by addressing the bui\u2019den of proof issue. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(2)(A). Although the Commission would not normally address such an issue, it had discretion to do so. The Commission did not explain why it chose to address the burden of proof issue, but it could have found that doing so was proper for multiple reasons. First, the Secretary explained that she did not raise the argument earlier because she did not know that the issue was disputed until she read Star-Tran\u2019s opening brief for the proceedings in front of the Commission. Furthermore, StarTran does not demonstrate that it was injured or prejudiced by being required to address the issue in its briefs before the Commission. Finally, StarTran does not argue that it would have presented additional evidence had it known that it bore the burden of proof.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Thus, addressing the issue did not harm StarTran\u2019s ability to develop its case. Therefore, the Commission did not err in addressing the burden of proof issue raised by the Secretary.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-9\">Next, StarTran argues that the district court erroneously concluded that StarTran bore the burden of proving its status as a political subdivision. StarTran contends that whether it is an employer under the OSH Act is a jurisdictional issue, so the Secretary should have had the burden of proof. <em>See Peoples Nat\u2019l Bank, </em>362 F.3d at 336 (\u201cThe party claiming federal subject matter jurisdiction has the burden of proving it exists.\u201d). The Secretary argues that this is not a jurisdictional issue, but an issue of exemption from coverage, so StarTran properly bore the burden of proof. The Commission agreed with the Secretary, and held that whether StarTran is an employer under the OSH Act is an issue of coverage, not of jurisdiction. Thus, it concluded that the burden of proof rests with StarTran to show that it falls within the political subdivision exception to the definition of employer under the OSH Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-10\">In <em>Arbaugh v. Y &amp; H Corp., </em>546 U.S. 500, 126 S.Ct. 1235, 1238, 163 L.Ed.2d 1097 (2006), the Supreme Court addressed whether the requirement that an \u201cemployer\u201d under Title VII have at least fifteen employees is a jurisdictional issue or a delineation of a substantive element of a Title VII claim for relief. The numerical requirement for employees is included in the definition of \u201cemployer\u201d under Title VII at 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e(b), which states that \u201c[tjhe term \u2018employer\u2019 means a person engaged in an industry affecting commerce who has fifteen or more employees.\u201d The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number><em>Arbaugh </em>Court indicated that \u201cwhen Congress does not rank a statutory limitation on coverage as jurisdictional, courts should treat the restriction as non-jurisdictional in character.\u201d 126 S.Ct. at 1245. As Title VII does not explicitly rank the numerical limitation in the definition of employer as a jurisdictional issue, the Court concluded that it was an element of the plaintiffs claim for relief. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b686-4\">Like the Title VII definition of employer, the OSH Act\u2019s definition of employer does not rank the political subdivision limitation as jurisdictional. Thus, the Commission properly concluded that whether StarTran is a political subdivision is not a jurisdictional issue. <em>See id. </em>However, the <em>Arbaugh </em>court indicated that the numerical limitation was an element of the plaintiffs claim for relief. <em>Id. </em>This implies that the Secretary must prove, as an element of her claim in this case, that StarTran is not a political subdivision. <em>Id. </em>However, the Supreme Court suggested that this is not the case in <em>NLRB v. Kentucky River Cmty. Care, Inc., </em>582 U.S. 706, 121 S.Ct. 1861, 1866, 149 L.Ed.2d 939 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b686-5\">In <em>Kentucky River, </em>the Supreme Court approved the NLRB\u2019s rule that the party asserting the \u201csupervisory exception\u201d to the NLRA has the burden of proving that it applies. <em>Id. </em>at 1866. The definition of \u201cemployee\u201d in the NLRA provides that \u201c[t]he term \u2018employee\u2019 ... shall not include ... any individual employed as a supervisor.\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 152(3). The Court noted that supervisors were \u201cexpressly excepted\u201d from the definition of employee. <em>Kentucky River, </em>121 S.Ct. at 1866. It indicated that as a rule of statutory construction, \u201cthe burden of proving justification or exemption under a special exception to the prohibitions of a statute generally rests on one who claims its benefits.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>FTC v. Morton Salt Co., </em>334 U.S. 37, 68 S.Ct. 822, 827, 92 L.Ed. 1196 (1948)). Thus, the Court deferred to the NLRB\u2019s rule for allocating the burden of proof because it was reasonable and consistent with the NLRA. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b686-7\">Moreover, this court has held that the party asserting the private membership club exemption under the Title VII definition of \u201cemployer,\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e(b)(2), has the burden of proving that it does not qualify as an employer. <em>Quijano v. Univ. Fed. Credit Union, </em>617 F.2d 129, 132 (5th Cir.1980). The definition of \u201cemployer\u201d under Title VII states that \u201c[t]he term \u2018employer\u2019 ... does not include ... a bona fide private membership club.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b686-8\"><em>Kentucky River </em>and <em>Quijano </em>support the Commission\u2019s holding that StarTran should bear the burden of proving that it qualifies for the political subdivision exception. The definitions at issue in <em>Kentucky River, Quijano, </em>and this case all contain language limiting a general definition of an otherwise covered employer or employee (the term \u201cemployee\u201d under the NLRA \u201cshall not include\u201d.supervisors, the term \u201cemployer\u201d under Title VII \u201cdoes not include\u201d private clubs, the term \u201cemployer\u201d under the OSH Act \u201cdoes not include\u201d political subdivisions). 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 152(3); 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e(b); 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 652(5). Under <em>Kentucky River </em>and <em>Quijano, </em>this limiting language creates an \u201cexemption under a special exception to the prohibitions of a statute,\u201d which indicates that the party asserting the exemption has the burden of proving it applies. <em>Kentucky River, </em>121 S.Ct. at 1866; <em>Quijano, </em>617 F.2d at 132. On the other hand, <em>Arbaugh </em>suggests that when a limitation is contained in the initial general statement of the affirmative statutory definition (\u201c[Ejmployer means a person ... who has fifteen or more employees\u201d), rather than as a subsequently stated exception to it, it should be treated as an element of the plaintiffs claim and the plaintiff should bear the burden of proving it. 42 U.S.C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>\u00a7 2000e(b); <em>Arbaugh, </em>126 S.Ct. at 1245. Because the definition of employer in the OSH Act contains limiting language comparable to that in the definitions of employee and employer at issue in <em>Kentucky River </em>and <em>Quijano, </em>it should be treated as an exemption for which StarTran bears the burden of proof instead of as an element of the Secretary\u2019s claim. Thus, the Commission properly concluded that Star-Tran should bear the burden of proving that it is exempt from the OSH Act as a political subdivision.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-5\">C. <em>Whether StarTran is a Political Subdivision of Texas</em></p>\n<p id=\"b687-6\">StarTran argues that the Commission erred in concluding that StarTran does not qualify as a political subdivision of Texas. The Secretary agrees with the Commission\u2019s holding, but interprets 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1975.5 in what appears to be a slightly different manner than the Commission. This court reviews the Commission\u2019s factual findings to determine whether they are supported by substantial evidence in the record taken as a whole. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 660(a). It reviews the Commission\u2019s legal conclusions to determine if they are \u201carbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(2)(A); <em>Trinity Marine Nashville, </em>275 F.3d at 427.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-10\">In a two-to-one decision, the Commission held that StarTran does not qualify as a political subdivision under the OSH Act and, therefore, is subject to OSHA\u2019s jurisdiction.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In its decision, the Commission indicated that whether StarTran is a political subdivision depends on whether it can satisfy the second test set forth in 29 C.F.R. 1975.5(b) by showing that it is \u201cadministered by individuals who are controlled by public officials and responsible to such officials or to the general electorate.\u201d It found \u201cthree factors to be particularly significant: the lack of public control over StarTran; StarTran\u2019s responsibilities for safety and health; and the fact that StarTran seeks to be viewed as an independent entity in other contexts.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> It did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>not address the other factors listed in 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1975.5(c).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The Commission concluded that although it is a \u201cclose case,\u201d StarTran did not carry its burden of proving that it is exempt from coverage under the OSH Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-4\">The Commission determined that Star-Tran is not subject to public control because it is not responsible to the general electorate, and evidence does not indicate that the individuals who administer the entity are controlled by Capital Metro.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> It concluded that StarTran is controlled by its own board and the terms of its collective bargaining agreement with the union. In reaching this conclusion it emphasized that StarTran has \u201cday-to-day control over all matters relating to the terms and conditions of employment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b688-9\">Under this section of its opinion, the Commission also indicated that had Star-Tran included its bylaws, it may have been able to establish that it qualifies as a political subdivision because it is controlled by public officials.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The Commission noted that in cases involving the political subdivision exception to the NLRA, courts have found important the fact that an entity\u2019s bylaws subject its board of directors to \u201coutside control.\u201d In support of this proposition, it cited <em>NLRB v. Princeton Mem\u2019l Hosp., </em>939 F.2d 174, 175 (4th Cir.1991), a case in which the Fourth Circuit held that the Princeton Health Care Center was exempt from NLRA coverage as a political subdivision in part because it was operated by the Princeton Memorial Hospital, whose board members were subject to rat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>ification and removal by a public entity.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> It also cited <em>Jefferson County Cmty. Ctr. for Developmental Disabilities, Inc. v. NLRB, </em>732 F.2d 122, 125-26 (10th Cir. 1984), <em>overruled on other grounds by Ara-mark Coup. v. NLRB, </em>179 F.3d 872, 882 (10th Cir.1999), a case in which the Tenth Circuit found that an entity was not a political subdivision in part because a majority of its board was not appointed or removable by public officials or the electorate. The Commission concluded that \u201cStarTran\u2019s failure to provide any such evidence here further weakens its claims of control by Capital Metro.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b689-5\">The Commission also found that it was \u201cof considerable significance\u201d that Star-Tran was responsible for the daily maintenance of the safety and health of its employees because ensuring safety and health of employees is the purpose of the OSH Act. Finally, the Commission discussed StarTran\u2019s treatment under federal and state laws. It noted that StarTran seeks to be an independent entity under Texas law, but does not dispute that it is subject to the NLRA, and does not assert the political subdivision exception to that act. Upon review of these three factors, the Commission concluded that StarTran does not qualify for the political subdivision exception to the OSH Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-6\">Only five cases, including two cases from federal courts of appeals, have cited 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1975.5. <em>See, e.g., Tricil Res., Inc. v. Brock, </em>842 F.2d 141, 142-43 (6th Cir. 1988); <em>Chicago Zoo, </em>820 F.2d at 910. In <em>Chicago Zoo, </em>the Seventh Circuit reversed the Commission\u2019s holding that the Chicago Zoological Society (the Zoo Society) was a political subdivision of the state. 820 F.2d at 910. The court found that the Zoo Society clearly failed the first branch of the test set forth in 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1975.5(b), and addressed whether it was administered by people who are controlled by public officials. <em>Id. </em>at 910-11. Despite the Zoo Society\u2019s financial dependence on a governmental body, the court held that the Zoo Society was not a political subdivision because the government did not directly control the zoo operations and management, the corporate structure of the Zoo Society did not include public officials, and the nature of the employment relationships was \u201cindisputably private.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 912. It emphasized that when the Commission determined that the Zoo Society was a political subdivision, it erred by giving too little weight to the Zoo Society\u2019s structure and the non-public nature of the zoo employee\u2019s jobs. <em>Id. </em>at 913. It stated that \u201c[ajbsent direct evidence of control\u201d it would not infer that because the Zoo Society relied on public funding, it was not a private entity. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b689-9\">In <em>Tried, </em>the Sixth Circuit upheld the decision of the Commission that Tried Resources, Inc. (Tried) was not a political subdivision. 842 F.2d at 141. Like the <em>Chicago Zoo </em>court, the Sixth Circuit analyzed whether Tried satisfied the second prong of the political subdivision test. <em>Id. </em>at 143. It held that, although many factors supported the contention that Tried should be exempt from the OSH Act, including the fact that the city exercised \u201csubstantial fiscal control\u201d over its operations, Tried did not qualify as a political subdivision. <em>Id. </em>at 143. In support of its proposition, the Court noted that Tried <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number>had independent authority over its workers and the terms of their employment, that it dealt with their labor unions, that its workers had different employee benefit plans than the city workers, and \u201cmost significantly,\u201d that Tricil was responsible for its workers\u2019 safety. <em>Id. </em>at 143-44.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-4\">The Commission\u2019s reasoning resembles that outlined in the two cases from our sister circuits discussing the political subdivision exemption from the OSH Act. As was ultimately determined in <em>Chicago Zoo </em>and <em>Tricil, </em>in this case,-the Commission found that StarTran was not a political subdivision despite the fact that it receives all its funding from Capital Metro. The Commission found other factors that were discussed in those cases more important, such as the fact that StarTran\u2019s operations and management are not fully controlled by Capital Metro. <em>See Chicago Zoo, </em>820 F.2d at 912. Furthermore, <em>Tricil </em>supports the Commission\u2019s claim that StarTran\u2019s responsibility for its workers\u2019 safety and health constitutes an important factor, as the <em>Tricil </em>court held that this factor is especially significant because the OSH Act is primarily concerned with the safety and health of workers. 842 F.2d at 144.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-5\">However, this case contains at least two important differences from <em>Chicago Zoo </em>and <em>Tricil. </em>In <em>Chicago Zoo, </em>the governmental body that funded the Zoo Society did not have the power to appoint and remove Zoo Society board members or officials, while in this case, the Capital Metro CEO has the power to appoint and remove individuals from the StarTran board. 820 F.2d at 912. Furthermore, unlike StarTran, the Society was originally formed with the help of state officials as a private nonprofit corporation, and only later did the Forest Preserve of Cook County become involved in the Beckfield Zoo operations. <em>Id. </em>at 910-11. Likewise, the Zoo Society\u2019s functions were never limited to operating the Beckfield Zoo. Similarly, Tricil was an existing private for-profit corporation both before and after it contracted with the City of Akron to operate Akron\u2019s facility in question, and apparently thereafter continued to operate other facilities for other clients. <em>Tricil, </em>842 F.2d at 141. StarTran was created by Capital Metro, a government entity, and has never either existed independently of Capital Metro or served other clients.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-8\">The Commission\u2019s opinion is problematic in that it does not acknowledge the evidence that the StarTran board may be removed by the Capital Metro CEO.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The Commission asserted that StarTran did not produce its bylaws or any other evidence regarding its corporate structure that could indicate that it is subject to external control. See note 8 <em>supra. </em>This statement is incorrect because the relevant corporate structure of StarTran was adequately demonstrated in the testimony provided in the hearing before the ALJ on April 24, 2003. The undisputed and unob-jected to evidence (including references to the StarTran by-laws) presented at the hearing clearly demonstrated that Star-Tran\u2019s five person board is controlled by and responsible to Capital Metro\u2019s CEO, who has the power to appoint <em>and remove all </em>StarTran board members (who are all at will employees, removable from their positions, as well as from their status as employees, by the Capital Metro CEO) from their positions. The ALJ in essence acknowledged this in his Decision and Order of July 23, 2003. It is also clear that the Capital Metro CEO is subject to the control of public officials as he is selected by the Capital Metro board, five out of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>seven of whom are elected officials. The Secretary has never disputed <em>any </em>of this.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Thus, the Commission\u2019s factual finding that StarTran did not demonstrate that its board of directors is subject to the external control of public officials is not supported by substantial evidence in the record. <em>See </em>29 U.S.C. \u00a7 660(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b691-5\">The fact that the Commission\u2019s opinion cites <em>Princeton Memorial Hospital </em>and <em>Jefferson County </em>suggests that it may have reached a different conclusion had it properly analyzed the evidence regarding Capital Metro\u2019s control of StarTran\u2019s board. These are two cases involving the political subdivision exception to the NLRA in which our sister circuits discussed the importance of whether the board of an entity is subject to removal by public officials. <em>See Princeton Mem\u2019l Hosp., </em>939 F.2d at 178; <em>Jefferson County, </em>732 F.2d at 125-26. The cases suggest that if a public official (or leaders of a concededly public entity) may remove members of the board of the entity in question, that entity is more likely to qualify as a political subdivision. <em>Id. </em>By citing these opinions, the Commission seems to have suggested that if it had acknowledged evidence regarding control of StarTran\u2019s board, it may have reached a different conclusion about StarTran\u2019s status as a political subdivision.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-11\">In light of the Commission\u2019s factual error regarding Capital Metro\u2019s control of StarTran\u2019s board, we must remand this case to the Commission for reconsideration of whether StarTran should be treated as a political subdivision of Texas under the OSH Act. As StarTran has characteristics of both a political subdivision and a private entity, this issue presents a close call. The evidence is simply not enough to establish <em>conclusively </em>that StarTran either is or is not a political subdivision for OSH Act purposes. Even the evidence that the StarTran board is removable by Capital Metro does not <em>per se conclusively </em>make StarTran a political subdivision. <em>See </em>note 7, <em>supra. </em>Thus, a remand to the Commission \u2014 rather than this court either affirming the Commission or rendering judgment for StarTran \u2014 is appropriate to allow the Commission to reevaluate the evidence and reach a conclusion not inconsistent with this opinion. <em>See S &amp; H Riggers &amp; Erectors, Inc. v. Occupational Safety and Health Review Comm\u2019n, </em>659 F.2d 1273, 1283 (5th Cir.1981) (indicating that fact finding is the role of the Commission and not the role of this court). On remand, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number>Commission must reconsider all of the evidence, including StarTran\u2019s corporate structure as reflected by the undisputed and unchallenged evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-4\">Furthermore, on remand, the Commission must defer to the Secretary\u2019s interpretation and application of 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1975.5 to this case, to the extent that such interpretation and application is reasonable. <em>Martin v. Occupational Safety and Health Review Comm\u2019n, </em>499 U.S. 144, 111 S.Ct. 1171, 1176, 113 L.Ed.2d 117 (1991). The OSH Act is unique in that it creates two administrative actors, the Secretary and the Commission. <em>Id. </em>at 1174. The Secretary is responsible for setting and enforcing health and safety standards in the workplace through the exercise of her rule making power, while the Commission is responsible for the adjudicatory functions under the OSH Act. <em>Id. </em>In OSH Act cases in which the Secretary and the Commission have reasonable but conflicting interpretations of an ambiguous regulation promulgated by the Secretary, this court should defer to the Secretary\u2019s interpretation. <em>Id. </em>at 1176; <em>see also Chicago Zoo, </em>820 F.2d at 912 (\u201c[T]he Commission\u2019s determination is owed no special deference; it is the Secretary, not the Commission, who exercises policymaking and prosecutorial authority under the [OSH] Act.\u201d).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The Court explained that \u201cthe power to render authoritative interpretations of OSH Act regulations is a \u2018necessary adjunct\u2019 of the Secretary\u2019s powers to promulgate and to enforce national health and safety standards.\u201d <em>Martin, </em>111 S.Ct. at 1176.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-6\">The Commission\u2019s and the Secretary\u2019s interpretations of 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1975.5 seem to differ in one important respect. In her brief, the Secretary emphasizes similar factors as the Commission when interpreting 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1975.5 and applying it to this case, such as the fact that StarTran is responsible the safety and health of its employees and the fact that StarTran seeks to be treated as an independent entity under statutes other than the OSH Act. However, she does not appear to find the Commission\u2019s public-control factor significant or determinative. She even mentions two times in her brief that StarTran board members may be removed from their positions by the Capital Metro CEO, but claims that this does not demonstrate that StarTran is a political subdivision. She states that who selects StarTran\u2019s board, whether they may be dismissed by Capital Metro, and who pays their salaries, are not important \u201cbecause the Commission reasonably found that StarTran had contractual autonomy to determine its employment conditions, the implementation of its collective bargaining agreements, and the administration of its safety program.\u201d She concludes that \u201ceven though all of StarTran\u2019s five board members are appointed and removable by Capital Metro\u2019s chief executive officer ... StarTran is not controlled by Capital Metro in these critical areas.\u201d Thus, the Secretary emphasizes StarTran\u2019s day-to-day control of its employees instead of Capital Metro\u2019s control of StarTran\u2019s board. She looks more to the factors set forth in section 1975.5(c) than the actual test set forth in section 1975.5(b), whether StarTran is \u201cadminis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>tered by individuals who are controlled by public officials and responsible to such officials.\u201d The Commission placed emphasis on the actual test by stressing the importance of who actually controls StarTran\u2019s leaders.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-5\">Because the Commission and the Secretary appear to set forth somewhat different interpretations of the regulation at issue, on remand, the Commission should defer to the Secretary\u2019s interpretation, to the extent that it is reasonable, in making its decision regarding whether the evidence reflects that StarTran is a political subdivision of Texas. <em>See Martin, </em>111 S.Ct. at 1176. We accordingly remand to the Commission for reconsideration, for the Commission to reassess the evidence, recognizing the StarTran\u2019s board <em>is </em>controlled by Capital Metro, and render a new judgment not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-6\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b693-7\">The judgment of the Commission is AFFIRMED IN PART and REMANDED IN PART FOR RECONSIDERATION.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b679-14\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.

The decision was written by Chairman Rail-man, with Commissioners Rogers and Thompson concurring in part and dissenting in part. Commissioner Rogers dissented in part from the Chairman's decision on the grounds that the case was not properly before the Commission. An AU\u2019s decision becomes a final order within thirty days unless a Commission member directs it for review within that period. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 661(j). Documents circulated to Commission members indicated that the AU\u2019s decision in this case was docketed on July 30, 2003 and would become final on August 29, 2003, when in reality, the decision was docketed one day earlier, and should have become final on August 28, 2003. Thus, a Commissioner directed the case for review on August 29, 2003, thirty-one days after the ALJ's decision was docketed. Commissioner Rogers dissented on the basis that the ALJ's decision was final on August 28, 2003, and the case was not properly brought before the Commission. However, he agreed with the Chairman\u2019s conclusion regarding StarTran's status as an employer under the OSH Act. Commissioner Thompson concurred with Chairman Railman's conclusion that the case was properly before the Commission, but dissented on the grounds that he would hold that StarTran qualifies as a political subdivision under the OSH Act.

In setting forth its \u201cpublic control\" factor, the Commission cites <em>Chicago Zoo, </em>820 F.2d at 913, for the proposition that \u201cthe record lacks sufficient evidence to show that Star-Tran met the political subdivision exemption because it was 'administered by individuals who are controlled by public officials and responsible to such officials or to the general public.\u2019 \u201d This \"factor\u201d is actually the test for determining whether StarTran is a political subdivision. It is not one of the factors listed in 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1975.5(c) for determining whether an entity satisfies the political subdivision test. However, \u00a7 1975(d) indicates <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>that the \u00a7 1975.5(c) list of factors is not exhaustive.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b688-6\">. The Commission was not necessarily required to look to other factors as the regulation states that \"[e]ach case must be viewed on its merits; and whether a single factor will be decisive, or whether the factors must be viewed in their relationship to each other as part of a sum total, also depends on the merits of each case.\" <em>Id. </em>at\u00a7 1975.5(d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b688-7\">. StarTran does <em>not </em>argue that it is simply the alter-ego of Capital Metro, or that its separate corporate existence should be disregarded under Texas law, so that both entities should be treated as political subdivisions. Although such an argument might have force under Texas law, if successful, it might render Star-Tran a public entity for all purposes under Texas law, which would prevent StarTran from bargaining collectively with its employees, which would prevent Capital Metro from receiving federal funding. Furthermore, the fact that Capital Metro has been involved with the creation and operation of StarTran does not necessarily mean that the two entities should be treated as one. <em>See United States v. Bestfoods, </em>524 U.S. 51, 118 S.Ct. 1876, 1884, 141 L.Ed.2d 43 (1998) (stating, in a case involving a wholly owned subsidiary, that \"[i]t is a general principle of corporate law deeply \u2018ingrained in our economic and legal systems' that a parent corporation (so-called because of control through ownership of another corporation\u2019s stock) is not liable for the acts of its subsidiaries.\"). Capital Metro\u2019s close involvement with StarTran does not necessarily render StarTran a political subdivision like Capital Metro because a subsidiary is not necessarily treated the same as its parent.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b688-11\">. The Commission opinion states; \u201cPerhaps, had StarTran introduced its by-laws or other evidence regarding its corporate structure that could indicate it was subject to external control, StarTran may have been able to establish that it was \u2018administered by individuals who are controlled by public officials and responsible to such officials or to the general public.' ... Indeed, in NLRB cases involving the political subdivision exemption under the NLRB, courts in determining the exemption have found decisive the fact that an entity\u2019s by-laws subject it to outside control. <em>See NLRB v. Princeton Mem\u2019l Hosp., </em>939 F.2d 174, 175 (4th Cir.1991) (hospital exempt where bylaws of hospital provided that the affairs of the corporation were managed by its Board of Directors, whose members were subject to ratification and removal by the Princeton Municipal Council)....

Persons are appointed to these positions as employees of StarTran and may be removed by the CEO of Capital Metro.\u201d <em>Ibid.\u201d (Id. </em>at 4).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b691-14\">The Secretary's brief in this court likewise states: \"StarTran\u2019s board of directors is composed of five members, all appointed and removable by the chief executive officer of Capital Metro, five of whose seven board members are publicly elected\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at 18).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b691-15\">The Secretary has <em>never </em>taken the position, either before the ALJ, before the Commission or before this court, that the evidence of Capital Metro\u2019s control over the StarTran board and its members, both in their capacity as members of its board in their capacity as StarTran executives, was in any way undermined or rendered incomplete, unpersuasive or incompetent by the absence of a copy of the StarTran by-laws.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b692-5\">. However, the Court noted that \"agency 'litigating positions\u2019 are not entitled to deference when they are merely appellate counsel's <em>'post hoc </em>rationalizations' for agency action, advanced for the first time in the reviewing court\u201d because such interpretations are furnished after agency proceedings have terminated and do not constitute an exercise of the Secretary\u2019s lawmaking power. <em>Id. </em>at 1179 (citations omitted). As there is no evidence that the Secretary changed her interpretation of 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1975.5 from the time the OSHA representative issued StarTran a fine to the time she began litigating the issue, her interpretation of the regulation is not a \"litigating position,\u201d and deserves deference.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
