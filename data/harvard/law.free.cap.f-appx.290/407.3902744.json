Jankun denying petitioner\u2019s application for asylum and withholding of removal. <em>In re Yu, </em>No. A 76 579 618 (B.I.A. Oct. 4, 2007), <em>ajfg </em>No. A 76 579 618 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City Oct. 21, 2005). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-10\">When the BIA adopts the decision of the IJ and supplements the IJ\u2019s decision, this Court reviews the decision of the IJ as supplemented by the BIA. <em>See Yan Chen v. Gonzales, </em>417 F.3d 268, 271 (2d Cir. 2005). We review the agency\u2019s factual findings under the substantial evidence standard, treating them as \u201cconclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>see also Corovic v. Mukasey, </em>519 F.3d 90, 95 (2d Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b430-11\">Substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s finding that Yu failed to establish a well-founded fear of future persecution based on the birth of her two children in the U.S. Yu testified that she was not currently in violation of China\u2019s family planning policy and that she did not know anyone who had returned to China with U.S.-born children. In addition, the IJ reasonably relied on the U.S. Department of State\u2019s 2004 Profile of Asylum Claims and Country Conditions, which indicates that U.S. diplomats are not aware of any cases where individuals have been forcibly sterilized upon return to China. The IJ also properly found that the affidavit of John Shields Aird was based on anecdotal evidence and did not address a situation, like Yu\u2019s, in which two children were born abroad. <em>See Wei Guang Wang v. BIA, </em>437 F.3d 270, 274-76 (2d Cir.2006) (holding that the Aird affidavit was of limited relevance because it was not prepared specifically for the petitioner and not particularized to the petitioner\u2019s circumstances).</p>\n<p id=\"b430-12\">We reject Y\u2019s argument that the BIA erred in not considering more recent evidence of conditions in China not within the administrative record, as we have held that remand for consideration of documents not in the record is inappropriate. <em>See Xiao Xing Ni v. Gonzales, </em>494 F.3d 260, 269 (2d Cir.2007); <em>see also </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(A). As for Yu\u2019s claim that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>the BIA failed to consider the evidence she submitted, we do not require the agency to \u201cexpressly parse or refute on the record each individual argument or piece of evidence offered,\u201d especially evidence which the agency \u201cis asked to consider time and again.\u201d <em>Wei Guang Wang, </em>437 F.3d at 275 (internal citations omitted). In any event, Yu fails to identify any material evidence in the record that the agency ignored.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-5\">Because Yu was unable to show the objective likelihood of persecution needed to make out an asylum claim, she was necessarily unable to meet the higher standard required to succeed on a claim for withholding of removal. <em>See Paul v. Gonzales, </em>444 F.3d 148, 156 (2d Cir.2006). Finally, we lack jurisdiction to consider Yu\u2019s argument that she is because she did not seek that relief before the IJ. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d)(1); <em>Karaj v. Gonzales, </em>462 F.3d 113, 119 (2d Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b431-6\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. As we have completed our review, any pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot. Any pending request for oral argument in this petition is DENIED in accordance with Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 34(a)(2), and Second Circuit Local Rule 34(b).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
