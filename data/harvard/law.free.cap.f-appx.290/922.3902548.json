The motion argued that Fontus would be persecuted should he return to Haiti, and that he therefore is entitled to asylum or withholding of removal. The Board denied this motion as untimely (the limit is three months). Although a motion may be submitted beyond three months if country conditions have deteriorated materially, the Board observed that Fontus does not argue that country conditions have changed since the time of the Board\u2019s ini<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"923\">*923</page-number>tial decision or his hearing before an immigration judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b945-5\">Fontus argues in this court that the Board abused its discretion by denying his motion to reopen. Claims of abuse of discretion in dealing with motions to reopen are outside this court\u2019s jurisdiction. <em>Kucana v. Mukasey, </em>533 F.3d 534 (7th Cir. 2008); <em>Li Fang Huang v. Mukasey, </em>534 F.3d 618 (7th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b945-6\">Fontus also argues that the Board violated the due process clause by refusing to allow him to seek asylum. Constitutional contentions are within our jurisdiction. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D). But an opportunity for a hearing was provided. Fontus could have applied for asylum years ago: he entered the United States in 1993 but did not raise the possibility of asylum until 2007, after the order of removal had become final. No case holds that the Constitution requires the agency to entertain belated claims by aliens who had, but did not use, ample opportunity to seek asylum and withholding of removal. Fontus\u2019s constitutional argument is frivolous, nothing but the abuse-of-discretion argument with different verbiage.</p>\n<p id=\"b945-7\">The petition for review is denied to the extent it asserts that the Board violated the Constitution and otherwise is dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
