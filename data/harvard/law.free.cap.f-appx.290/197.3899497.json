LUCERO, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b220-26\">After he pleaded guilty to unlawful reentry as a deported alien previously convict<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>ed of an aggravated felony, in violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(a) and (b)(2), the district court sentenced Cruz Aguirre-Cordero to 51 months\u2019 imprisonment. At the same hearing, Aguirre-Cordero admitted to violations of the terms of his supervised release in two prior sentences. The district court imposed revocation sentences of 10 months\u2019 and 18 months\u2019 imprisonment to run concurrently with each other, but consecutively to the 51-month sentence imposed for the unlawful reentry conviction. In this consolidated appeal, Aguirre-Cordero challenges all three sentences. Aguirre-Cordero\u2019s counsel moves for leave to withdraw from the case in a brief filed pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). Because we conclude that the record presents no nonfrivolous grounds for relief, we grant counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw and affirm Aguirre-Cordero\u2019s sentences. We have jurisdiction under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(a) and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b221-6\">In February 2000, Aguirre-Cordero was convicted in the District of New Mexico of possession with intent to distribute less than 50 kilograms of marijuana, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1) and (b)(1)(D) (the \u201cNew Mexico case\u201d). The district court sentenced him to 10 months\u2019 imprisonment, followed by 2 years\u2019 supervised release. Aguirre-Cordero was subsequently deported to Mexico on July 5, 2000.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-11\">On March 28, 2001, during his term of supervised release, Aguirre-Cordero was arrested on a traffic charge in Greeley, Colorado. Having illegally returned to the United States, Aguirre-Cordero was then indicted on one count of unlawful reentry of a deported alien previously convicted of an aggravated felony, in violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(a) and (b)(2) (the \u201cprior unlawful reentry case\u201d).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The government also alleged that Aguirre-Cordero\u2019s unlawful reentry violated a condition of his supervised release in the New Mexico case, which had been transferred to the District of Colorado following the indictment for unlawful reentry.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-12\">Aguirre-Cordero pleaded guilty to the unlawful reentry charge and admitted to violating the condition of his supervised release. On the unlawful reentry charge, the district court sentenced Aguirre-Cordero to 37 months\u2019 imprisonment followed by 3 years\u2019 supervised release. The district court also revoked Aguirre-Corde-ro\u2019s supervised release in the New Mexico case and sentenced him to a consecutive 4-month term of imprisonment followed by 32 months\u2019 supervised release. On April 26, 2004, following his release from prison, Aguirre-Cordero was again deported to Mexico.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-13\">Nevertheless, on October 30, 2005, having once again reentered the United States <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>illegally, Aguirre-Cordero was arrested by the Colorado State Patrol and charged in state court with possession of a controlled substance. He was convicted and, after serving part of a 15-month sentence, was paroled to the custody of the Bureau of Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Throughout this period, Aguirre-Cordero was subject to supervised release in both the New Mexico case and the prior unlawful reentry case.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-4\">On November 13, 2006, Aguirre-Corde-ro was indicted for unlawful reentry of a deported alien previously convicted of an aggravated felony, in violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(a) and (b)(2) (the \u201cextant unlawful reentry case\u201d). The government also petitioned to revoke Aguirre-Cordero\u2019s supervised release in the New Mexico case and in the prior unlawful reentry case, on the grounds that he had violated the conditions of his release by (1) unlawfully reentering the United States and (2) unlawfully possessing a controlled substance. Aguirre-Cordero subsequently pleaded guilty to the extant unlawful reentry charge and admitted to both violations of his terms of supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-5\">On the extant unlawful reentry charge, Aguirre-Cordero\u2019s presentence report calculated a base offense level of 8. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(a). His offense level was then increased by 12 levels due to his previous deportation after conviction of a drug trafficking felony, \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(B), and reduced by 3 levels for acceptance of responsibility upon motion of the government, \u00a7 3El.l(b), resulting in a total offense level of 17. Based on his criminal history category of VI, the resulting advisory United States Sentencing Guidelines (\u201cGuidelines\u201d) range was 51 to 63 months\u2019 imprisonment. At sentencing, the government recommended that Aguirre-Corde-ro\u2019s sentence not exceed the bottom of the applicable Guidelines range. The district court accepted the government\u2019s recommendation and sentenced Aguirre-Cordero to 51 months\u2019 imprisonment followed by 3 years\u2019 supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-9\">Aguirre-Cordero\u2019s Colorado state conviction, the more serious of his supervised release violations,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> qualifies as a Grade B violation under the Guidelines. \u00a7 7Bl.l(a)(2). Combined with his criminal history category of I when originally sentenced in the New Mexico case, the Guidelines range for his release violations in that case was 4 to 10 months\u2019 imprisonment. \u00a7 7B1.4(a). In the prior unlawful reentry case, Aguirre-Cordero had a criminal history category of IV when originally sentenced, resulting in a Guidelines range of 12 to 18 months\u2019 imprisonment for the violations. <em>Id. </em>The district court revoked Aguirre-Cordero\u2019s release in both cases and sentenced him to 10 months\u2019 and 18 months\u2019 imprisonment respectively. The court ordered these sentences to be served concurrently with each other but consecutively to the 51-month sentence for the unlawful reentry charge. Aguirre-Corde-ro now appeals each sentence.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b222-10\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b222-11\">If an attorney conscientiously examines a case and determines that any appeal would be wholly frivolous, counsel may \u201cso advise the court and request permission to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>withdraw.\u201d <em>Anders, </em>386 U.S. at 744, 87 S.Ct. 1396. Counsel must submit a brief to both the appellate court and the client, pointing to anything in the record that could potentially present an appealable issue. The client may then choose to offer argument to the court. If, upon complete examination of the record, the court determines that the appeal is frivolous, it may grant counsel\u2019s request to withdraw. <em>Id. </em>Acting pursuant to <em>Anders, </em>counsel in the present case provided Aguirre-Cordero with a copy of the appellate brief, and Aguirre-Cordero has declined the opportunity to file a pro se brief in response.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-5\">Counsel\u2019s brief raises only three arguably appealable issues: (1) whether the district court complied with Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure when accepting Aguirre-Cordero\u2019s guilty plea; (2) whether the district court imposed reasonable sentences; and (3) whether the district court abused its discretion by imposing consecutive sentences. Upon review of the record, we conclude that there is no nonfrivolous basis, whether raised or unraised by counsel, for challenging the sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b223-7\">Our independent review of the record reveals that the district court complied with Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 11. Rule 11 requires that, prior to accepting a defendant\u2019s guilty plea, \u201cthe court must address the defendant personally in open court.... [T]he court must inform the defendant of, and determine that the defendant understands,\u201d certain rights and matters relating to his likely punishment, including the right to plead not guilty, the right to a jury trial, the right to counsel, and the right to confront adverse witnesses. Fed.R.Crim.P. 11(b)(1). In addition, the district court must determine whether the plea is voluntary, Fed. R. Crim.P. 11(b)(2), and whether a factual basis exists to support it, Fed.R.Crim.P. 11(b)(3). The transcript of the Aguirre-Cordero\u2019s plea colloquy demonstrates that the district court faithfully applied Rule 11. Through a translator, the district court explained the rights Aguirre-Corde-ro waived by pleading guilty, described the law that would govern his punishment, ensured the plea was voluntary, and probed the facts underlying the plea. Accordingly, the district court committed no error with respect to Rule 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-9\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b223-10\">The record also shows that Aguirre-Cordero received reasonable sentences. We review Aguirre-Cordero\u2019s sentence on the unlawful reentry charge for reasonableness, deferring to the district court\u2019s sentencing determination under an abuse of discretion standard. <em>United States v. A.B., </em>529 F.3d 1275, 1277 (10th Cir.2008). \u201cOur appellate review for reasonableness includes both a procedural component, encompassing the method by which a sentence was calculated, as well as a substantive component, which relates to the length of the resulting sentence.\u201d <em>United States v. Smart, </em>518 F.3d 800, 803 (10th Cir. 2008). A court commits procedural error by, among other things, \u201cfailing to calculate (or improperly calculating) the Guidelines range, treating the Guidelines as mandatory, failing to consider the [18 U.S.C.] \u00a7 3553(a) factors, selecting a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts, or failing to adequately explain the chosen sentence \u2014 including an explanation for any deviation from the Guidelines range.\u201d <em>Gall v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S. Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). A court commits substantive error if it imposes an unreasonably long sentence in light of the statutory factors in \u00a7 3553(a). <em>See A.B., </em>529 F.3d at 1278 (\u201c \u2018In evaluating <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>the substantive reasonableness of a sentence, we ask whether the length of the sentence is reasonable considering the statutory factors delineated in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).\u2019\u201d (quoting <em>United States v. Hamilton, </em>510 F.3d 1209, 1217-18 (10th Cir.2007))).</p>\n<p id=\"b224-4\">On the unlawful reentry conviction, the court imposed a procedurally and substantively reasonable sentence. The district court committed none of the procedural errors identified in <em>Gall. </em>It properly calculated the Guidelines range, acknowledged the Guidelines\u2019 advisory status, and considered arguments of both AguirreCordero and the government before imposing a within-Guidelines sentence. <em>See United States v. Cereceres-Zavala, </em>499 F.3d 1211, 1217 (10th Cir.2007) (\u201c[W]here a district court imposes a sentence falling within the range suggested by the Guidelines, Section 3553(c) requires the court to provide only a general statement of the reasons for its imposition of the particular sentence.\u201d (quotation omitted)). In addition, we presume that sentences within the Guidelines range are substantively reasonable, <em>United States v. Kristl, </em>437 F.3d 1050, 1054 (10th Cir.2006), and nothing in the record rebuts that presumption. To the contrary, a sentence of 51 months\u2019 imprisonment, the bottom of the suggested Guidelines range, was substantively reasonable in light of the factors identified in \u00a7 3553(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b224-5\">We also review revocation sentences for procedural and substantive reasonableness. A district court imposes a procedurally reasonable revocation sentence when it properly considers the sentencing factors outlined in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e),<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and we apply a rebuttable presumption of substantive reasonableness to within-Guidelines sentences, <em>see Kristi, </em>437 F.3d at 1054.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Here, the district court carefully explored the asserted bases for the alleged supervised release violations, explained the applicable Guideline ranges associated with each violation, and imposed sentences within those suggested ranges. The district court therefore committed no procedural error. <em>See Cereceres-Zavala, </em>499 F.3d at 1217 (explaining that a district court need only provide a \u201cgeneral statement\u201d of reasons for imposing a within-Guidelines sentence). Moreover, nothing in the record overcomes the presumption of substantive reasonableness applicable to within-Guidelines sentences. Accordingly, the court committed no error in revoking Aguirre-Cordero\u2019s terms of supervised release and imposing sentences of 10 and 18 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-9\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b224-10\">Finally, the district court did not abuse its discretion by ordering consecutive sentences. <em>See Contreras-Martinez, </em>409 F.3d at 1241 (reviewing such a decision for abuse of discretion). Although advisory, the Guidelines provide that \u201c[a]ny term of imprisonment imposed upon the revocation of probation or supervised release shall be ordered to be served consecutively <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>to any sentence of imprisonment that the defendant is serving, whether or not the sentence of imprisonment being served resulted from the conduct that is the basis of the revocation of probation or supervised release.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 7B1.3(f). The district court followed the Guidelines\u2019 recommendation here and more than sufficiently justified its decision. Accordingly, the district court acted well within its discretion in imposing consecutive rather than concurrent sentences. <em>See Rodriguez-Quin-tanilla, </em>442 F.3d at 1258-59; <em>Contreras-Martinez, </em>409 F.3d at 1241-42.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b225-6\">For the foregoing reasons, we GRANT counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw and AFFIRM Aguirre-Cordero\u2019s sentences.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b220-15\"> The case is unanimously ordered submitted without oral argument pursuant to Fed. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>R.App. P. 34(a)(2) and 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 32.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b221-8\">. Aguirre-Cordero's conviction in the New Mexico case provided the predicate aggravated felony for this unlawful reentry charge.
