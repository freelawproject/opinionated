The district court sentenced her to 235 months of imprisonment. Eekles appeals her sentence, asserting that the district court erred in determining the amount of drugs attributable to her and in refusing to award a mitigating role downward adjustment. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-10\">Eekles contends that the district court did not make particularized findings with regard to the scope of her agreement to participate in the conspiracy or to the amount of drugs reasonably foreseeable to her, as required by <em>United States v. Bolden, </em>325 F.3d 471 (4th Cir.2003). Appellate review of a district court\u2019s imposition of a sentence is for abuse of discretion. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 586, 596, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). The appellate court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b558-13\">must first ensure that the district court committed no significant procedural error, such as failing to calculate (or improperly calculating) the Guidelines range, treating the Guidelines as mandatory, failing to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, selecting a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts, or failing to adequately explain the chosen sentence\u2014 including an explanation for any deviation from the Guidelines range. Assuming that the district court\u2019s sentencing decision is procedurally sound, the appellate court should then consider the substantive reasonableness of the sentence imposed under an abuse-of-discretion standard.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b558-16\"><em>Id. </em>at 597.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-17\">With these standards in mind, we have reviewed the record and conclude that the district court implicitly made the findings required by <em>Bolden </em>by relying on information in the presentence report and on the federal agent\u2019s testimony at sentencing summarizing the trial evidence that pertained directly to Eekles\u2019 activities during the time Rick Eekles lived with her and operated his crack business out of her house. <em>See U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 1B1.3 cmt. n. 2 (2006) (\u201cIn determining the scope of the criminal activity that the particular defendant agreed to jointly undertake ..., the court may consider any explicit agreement <em>or implicit agreement fairly inferred from the conduct of the defendant </em>and others.\u201d) (emphasis added). We also find that the district court did not clearly err in attributing more than 1.5 kilograms of crack to Eck-les. <em>See United States v. Fullilove, </em>388 F.3d 104, 106 (4th Cir.2004) (stating standard of review).</p>\n<p id=\"b558-18\">Eekles also asserts that the district court erred by failing to award a mitigating role downward adjustment because she was involved in the conspiracy for only six months. Our review of the record leads us to conclude that the district court did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>clearly err in this regard because Eckles failed to meet her burden of showing that she was entitled to the downward adjustment. <em>See United States v. Kiulin, </em>360 F.3d 456, 463 (4th Cir.2004) (stating standard of review); <em>United States v. Akin-koye, </em>185 F.3d 192, 202 (4th Cir.1999) (allocating burden).</p>\n<p id=\"b559-5\">Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s judgment. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
