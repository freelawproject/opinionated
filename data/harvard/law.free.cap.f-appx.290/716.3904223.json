He contends that his 96-month sentence violated his equal protection rights because he did not have the benefit of a fast-track program in the Northern District of Texas and similarly situated defendants in jurisdictions with the program could receive lower sentences based simply on arbitrary geographic factors. Villarreal-Morales concedes that his argument is foreclosed by circuit precedent, but he raises the argument to preserve it for further review. Based on Villarreal-Morales\u2019s concession, the Government moves for summary affir-mance or dismissal. In the alternative, the Government requests an extension of time in which to file a brief on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-20\">Villarreal-Morales\u2019s equal protection argument is foreclosed by circuit precedent. <em>See United States v. Lopez-Velasquez, </em>526 F.3d 804, 808 (5th Cir.), <em>petition for cert. filed </em>(July 25, 2008) (No. 08-5514). Accordingly, the district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED, the Government\u2019s motion for summary affirmance is GRANTED, and the Government\u2019s motions for dismissal and an extension of time are DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b738-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
