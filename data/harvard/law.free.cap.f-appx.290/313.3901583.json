Tip-pins argues that, pursuant to <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), and <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), the enhancement of his sentence was a violation of his Fifth and Sixth Amendment rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-4\">We review <em>de novo </em>questions concerning the constitutionality of a sentence. <em>United States v. Paz, </em>405 F.3d 946, 948 (11th Cir.2005) (per curiam). The career offender provision, under which Tippins was sentenced, states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-5\">A defendant is a career offender if (1) the defendant was at least eighteen years old at the time the defendant committed the instant offense of conviction; (2) the instant offense of conviction is a felony that is either a crime of violence or a controlled substance offense; and (3) the defendant has at least two prior felony convictions of either a crime of violence or a controlled substance offense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b336-8\">U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4Bl.l(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b336-9\">In <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998), the Supreme Court held that a defendant\u2019s prior convictions used to enhance a sentence are not to be treated as an element of the offense for constitutional purposes, and as a result, the prior conviction is not required to be alleged in the indictment. <em>Id., </em>523 U.S. at 226-27, 118 S.Ct. at 1222. We have held that, \u201cunless and until the Supreme Court specifically overrules <em>Almendarez-Torres,\u201d </em>we will continue to follow it. <em>United States v. Greer, </em>440 F.3d 1267, 1273 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b336-10\">We have noted that, while recent decisions may arguably cast doubt on the future prospects of <em>Almendarez-Torres, </em>the case is still controlling precedent as the Supreme Court has not explicitly overruled it. <em>United States v. Camacho-Ibar-quen, </em>410 F.3d 1307, 1316 n. 3 (11th Cir. 2005) (per curiam). As the Supreme Court has stated, its \u201cdecisions remain binding precedent until [it] see[s] fit to reconsider them, regardless of whether subsequent cases have raised doubts about their continuing vitality.\u201d <em>Hohn v. United States, </em>524 U.S. 236, 252-53, 118 S.Ct. 1969, 1978, 141 L.Ed.2d 242 (1998). We have held that the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>\u201cwas left undisturbed by <em>Apprendi, Blakely, </em>and <em>Booker.</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em>\u201d United States v. Shelton, </em>400 F.3d 1325, 1329 (11th Cir.2005). Likewise, <em>Jones v. United States, </em>526 U.S. 227, 249, 119 S.Ct. 1215, 1227, 143 L.Ed.2d 311 (1999) did not overrule <em>Almendarez-Tor-res. See United States v. Orduno-Mi-reles, </em>405 F.3d 960, 962 (11th Cir.2005) (stating that \u201c[t]he reason for the exception for prior convictions is clear: \u2018a prior conviction must itself have been established through procedures satisfying the fair notice, reasonable doubt, and jury trial guarantees.\u2019 \u201d) (quoting <em>Jones, </em>526 U.S. at 249, 119 S.Ct. at 1227). We have noted that \u201cbecause the prior-conviction exception remains undisturbed after <em>Booker, </em>a district court does not err by relying on prior convictions to enhance a defendant\u2019s sentence.\u201d <em>Orduno-Mireles, </em>405 F.3d at 962.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-13\">Upon review of the record and the parties\u2019 briefs, we discern no reversible error. Because Supreme Court and our own precedent hold that prior convictions need not be charged in the indictment or proved to a jury, Tippins\u2019s argument to the contrary fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-14\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b336-11\">. <em>United States v.
