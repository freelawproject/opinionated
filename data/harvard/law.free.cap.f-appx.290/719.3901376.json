Chrisenber-ry avers that his sentence is unreasonable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"720\">*720</page-number>because the district court failed to consider as required by 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(6) whether the sentence imposed resulted in an unwarranted sentencing disparity between himself and his codefendants. Because the district court correctly calculated and reviewed Chrisenberry\u2019s guidelines range, the court \u201cnecessarily gave significant weight and consideration to the need to avoid unwarranted disparities.\u201d See <em>Gall v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 586, 599, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). The fact that Chrisenberry\u2019s sentence was within the pertinent guidelines range reduces this court\u2019s concern with sentencing disparities to a \u201cminimum.\u201d <em>See United States v. Willingham, </em>497 F.3d 541, 545 (5th Cir.2007). Moreover, the district court was aware of the sentences of the codefendants, who had cooperated with the Government and received downward departures.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b741-28\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
