MURPHY, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b147-24\">After examining the briefs and the appellate record, this court has determined unanimously that oral argument would not materially assist the determination of this appeal. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). Accordingly, the case is ordered submitted without oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-25\">Proceeding <em>pro se, </em>Alex Orozco appeals the district court\u2019s dismissal of the Motion to Modify Sentence he brought pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). On May 18, 2005, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>Orozco pleaded guilty to one count of distributing methamphetamine, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1). <em>United States v. Orozco, </em>219 Fed.Appx. 777, 777 (10th Cir. 2007). The Government\u2019s motion to enforce an appeal waiver contained in Or-ozco\u2019s plea agreement was granted by this court and his direct appeal was dismissed. <em>Id. </em>at 778.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-4\">Orozco then filed the \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion that is the subject of this appeal. In his motion, Orozco argued his sentence should be modified based on changes made to \u00a7 4A1.2 of the United States Sentencing Guidelines. <em>See United States v. Torres-Aquino, </em>334 F.3d 939, 940 (10th Cir.2003) (\u201cUnder 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2), a court may reduce a previously imposed sentence if the Sentencing Commission has lowered the applicable sentencing range and \u2018such a reduction is consistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission.\u2019 \u201d). The Government sought dismissal of Orozco\u2019s motion, basing its argument on the following waiver provision in the plea agreement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b148-5\">Defendant knowingly and voluntarily waives any right to appeal or collaterally attack any matter in connection with this prosecution, conviction and sentence. The defendant is aware that Title 18, U.S.C. \u00a7 3742 affords a defendant the right to appeal the conviction and sentence imposed. By entering into this agreement, the defendant knowingly waives any right to appeal a sentence imposed which is within the guideline range determined appropriate by the court. The defendant also waives any right to challenge a sentence or otherwise attempt to modify or change his sentence or manner in which it was determined in any collateral attack, including, but not limited to, ... a motion brought under Title 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b148-6\">The district court granted the Government\u2019s motion and dismissed Orozco\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion. The court concluded the issues Orozco sought to raise fell within the scope of the waiver in his plea agreement which he entered into knowingly and voluntarily. <em>See United States v. Hahn, </em>359 F.3d 1315, 1327 (10th Cir.2004) (en banc). In the alternative, the district court concluded Orozco\u2019s claims failed on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-7\">Orozco filed the instant appeal, challenging the district court\u2019s dismissal of his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion. We have reviewed the record, the appellate briefs, and the applicable law and conclude the dismissal of Orozco\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion was clearly correct. Accordingly, the district court\u2019s order dismissing Orozco\u2019s motion is affirmed for substantially the reasons stated in the district court\u2019s order dated February 21, 2008.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b147-27\"><em> </em>This order and judgment is not binding precedent except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed. R.App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
