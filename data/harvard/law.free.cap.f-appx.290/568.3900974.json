Djoumgoue, a native and citizen of Cameroon, petitions for review of an order of the Board of Immigration Appeals (\u201cBoard\u201d) dismissing his appeal from the immigration judge\u2019s order denying his applications for asylum, withholding from removal and withholding under the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d). Djoum-goue claims the Board erred in adopting the immigration judge\u2019s adverse credibility finding. He also claims he submitted substantial evidence entitling him to asylum. In addition, Djoumgoue challenges the Board\u2019s denial of his motion to file a brief out of time and his subsequent motion for reconsideration of the denial. Finding no error, we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-10\">The INA authorizes the Attorney General to confer asylum on any refugee. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a) (2006). It defines a refugee as a person unwilling or unable to return to his native country \u201cbecause of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A) (2006). \u201cPersecution involves the infliction or threat of death, torture, or injury to one\u2019s person or freedom, on account of one of the enumerated grounds----\u201d <em>Li v. Gonzales, </em>405 F.3d 171, 177 (4th Cir.2005) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b591-12\">An alien \u201cbear[s] the burden of proving eligibility for asylum,\u201d <em>Naizgi v. Gonzales, </em>455 F.3d 484, 486 (4th Cir.2006) (citing 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.13(a) (2008)), and can establish refugee status based on past persecution in his native country on account of a protected ground. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.13(b)(1). \u201cAn applicant who demonstrates that he was the subject of past persecution is presumed to have a well-founded fear of persecution.\u201d <em>Ngarurih v. Ashcroft, </em>371 F.3d 182, 187 (4th Cir.2004). Without regard to past persecution, an alien can establish a well-founded fear of persecution on a protected ground. <em>Id. </em>at 187. The well-founded fear standard contains both a subjective and an objective component. The objective element requires a showing of specific, concrete facts that would lead a reasonable person in like circumstances to fear persecution. <em>Gandziami-Mickhou v. Gonzales, </em>445 F.3d 351, 353 (4th Cir.2006). \u201cThe subjective component can be met through the presentation of candid, credible, and sincere testimony demonstrating a genuine fear of persecution.... [It] must have some basis in the reality of the circumstances and be validated with specific, concrete facts ... and it cannot be mere irrational apprehension.\u201d <em>Li, </em>405 F.3d at 176 (internal quotation marks, alterations, and citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b591-13\">Credibility findings are reviewed for substantial evidence. A trier of fact who rejects an applicant\u2019s testimony on credibility grounds must offer \u201cspecific, cogent reason[s]\u201d for doing so. <em>Figeroa v. INS, </em>886 F.2d 76, 78 (4th Cir.1989) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). This court accords broad, though not unlimited, deference to credibility findings supported by substantial evidence. <em>Ca-mara v. Ashcroft, </em>378 F.3d 361, 367 (4th <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>Cir.2004). If the immigration judge\u2019s adverse credibility finding is based on speculation and conjecture rather than specific and cogent reasoning, however, it is not supported by substantial evidence. <em>Tew-abe v. Gonzales, </em>446 F.3d 533, 538 (4th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b592-4\">A determination regarding eligibility for asylum or withholding of removal is affirmed if supported by substantial evidence on the record considered as a whole. <em>INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 481, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992). Administrative findings of fact are conclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to decide to the contrary. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B) (2006). This court will reverse the Board only if \u201cthe evidence ... presented was so compelling that no reasonable factfinder could fail to find the requisite fear of persecution.\u201d <em>Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. at 483-84, 112 S.Ct. 812; <em>see also Rusu v. INS, </em>296 F.3d 316, 325 n. 14 (4th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b592-5\">We find substantial evidence supports the immigration judge\u2019s adverse credibility finding. The immigration judge provided specific and cogent reasons for finding Djoumgoue not credible and the record does not compel a different result.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-6\">We further find no abuse of discretion in the Board\u2019s order denying Djoumgoue\u2019s request to file a brief out of time. Insofar as he claimed he was denied due process, we find he failed to establish any prejudice. <em>See Rusu, </em>296 F.3d at 324; <em>Farrokhi v. INS, </em>900 F.2d 697, 703 n. 7 (4th Cir.1990). Despite Djoumgoue\u2019s failure to file a timely brief, the Board reviewed the merits of the appeal. Djoumgoue failed to indicate what issues were ignored because the Board did not have his brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-7\">Accordingly, we deny the petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-9\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
