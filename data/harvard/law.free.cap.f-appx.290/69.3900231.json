Gonzales, </em>479 F.3d 646, 648 (9th Cir.2007) (per curiam). We lack jurisdiction to review petitioner\u2019s asylum claim because he failed to appeal the IJ\u2019s discretionary denial of asylum to the Board of Immigration Appeals and thus failed to exhaust his administrative remedies. <em>See Barron v. Ashcroft, </em>358 F.3d 674, 678 (9th Cir.2004); <em>Zara v. Ashcroft, </em>383 F.3d 927, 930 (9th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b92-20\">The BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying petitioner\u2019s motion to remand. Petitioner\u2019s <em>commission </em>of the offense of possessing a controlled substance in May 2004 interrupted his continuous residence in the United States before he satisfied the seven-year requirement for cancellation of removal. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(a); 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(d)(l). Further, petitioner is ineligible for relief under the Federal First Offender Act because there is no court order entered a state rehabilitative statute. <em>See Chavez-Perez </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number><em>v. Ashcroft, </em>386 F.3d 1284, 1289 (9th Cir. 2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b93-5\">Petitioner doesn\u2019t qualify for withholding of removal or CAT relief because the harassment he alleged that his family faced in Fiji on account of their Indian heritage at most reflects general racial and economic tension. Petitioner can\u2019t establish that he personally suffered, or will suffer if deported, persecution, let alone torture. <em>See Singh v. INS, </em>134 F.3d 962, 967 (9th Cir.1998); <em>Prasad, v. INS, </em>47 F.3d 336, 340 (9th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b93-6\">PETITION DISMISSED IN PART AND DENIED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b92-21\"><em> </em>This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
