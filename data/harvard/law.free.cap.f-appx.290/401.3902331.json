Judge Hel-lerstein sentenced Rivas to a term of 57 months\u2019 imprisonment, the bottom of the Guidelines range of 57-71 months. We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the facts, the procedural context, and the specification of appellate issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-6\">On appeal, Rivas argues that his sentence was unreasonable. The standard for reasonableness review is \u201cakin to review for abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>United States v. Fernandez, </em>443 F.3d 19, 27 (2d Cir.2006). \u201c[I]n the overwhelming majority of cases, a Guidelines sentence will fall comfortably within the broad range of sentences that would be reasonable in the particular circumstances.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Here, Rivas was sentenced to a prison term at the bottom of the Guidelines range. While Rivas quarrels with the district court\u2019s balancing of the sentencing factors, the weight to be given to each of those considerations \u201cis a matter firmly committed to the discretion of the sentencing judge and is beyond our appellate review, as long as the sentence imposed is reasonable in light of all the circumstances presented.\u201d <em>United States v. Florez, </em>447 F.3d 145, 158 (2d Cir.2006) (quotation omitted). Nor does \u201ca district court\u2019s refusal to adjust a sentence to compensate for the absence of a fast-track program ... make a sentence unreasonable.\u201d <em>United States v. Mejia, </em>461 F.3d 158, 164 (2d Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b424-7\">Accordingly, for the reasons set forth above, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
