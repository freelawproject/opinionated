We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the facts and the record of prior proceedings, which we reference only as necessary to explain our decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-30\">In the aftermath of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>we review sentences for \u201creasonableness,\u201d 543 U.S. 220, 262, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), \u201ca deferential standard limited to identifying abuse of discretion regardless of whether a chai-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>lenged sentence is \u2018inside, just outside, or significantly outside the Guidelines range.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Jones, </em>531 F.3d 163, 170 (2d Cir.2008) (quoting <em>Gall v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 586, 591, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007)). Our review proceeds in two steps: we \u201cmust first ascertain whether the sentence was administered without procedural error,\u201d <em>United States v. Williams, </em>524 F.3d 209, 214 (2d Cir.2008); and second, if the sentence is \u201cprocedurally sound,\u201d we must \u201cconsider [its] substantive reasonableness\u201d by evaluating \u201cwhether the District Judge abused his discretion in determining that the [18 U.S.C.] \u00a7 3553(a) factors supported\u201d the sentence imposed, <em>Gall v. United States, </em>128 S.Ct. at 597, 600.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-7\">On this appeal, Johnson argues that (1) the district court misapprehended its authority to impose a non-Guidelines sentence; (2) the court improperly imposed a special condition of supervised release in the written judgment that was inconsistent with the one pronounced in his presence at the time of sentencing; and (3) the sentence imposed was substantively unreasonable because it did not reflect the fact that Johnson had served 17 months in state prison in connection with a parole violation arising from the same firearm possession supporting his federal conviction. None of these arguments has merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-8\">\n<em>1. Authority to Impose Non-Guidelines Sentence</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b471-9\">Nothing in the record in this case undermines our general assumption that a sentencing judge \u201cunderstood all the available sentencing options, including whatever departure authority existed in the circumstances of the case.\u201d <em>United States v. Sanchez, </em>517 F.3d 651, 665 (2d Cir.2008) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). The district judge\u2019s statement that he \u201cconsidered all of the factors under Section 3553(a)\u201d and concluded that \u201ca guideline sentence here is appropriate,\u201d and his statement that \u201cthe sentence within the guidelines is not inappropriate,\u201d <em>see </em>Sentencing Tr. at 13, Mar. 19, 2007, are sufficient both to confirm his understanding that a Guidelines sentence was not mandatory and to demonstrate his imposition of an \u201cindividualized\u201d sentence. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>128 S.Ct. at 597.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-11\">\n<em>2. Special Condition of Supervised Release</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b471-12\">Johnson submits that the district court erred in imposing a special condition of supervised release in the written judgment \u2014 \u201c[t]he defendant shall obtain a GED\u201d \u2014 that it did not pronounce in open court. <em>See United States v. Rosario, </em>386 F.3d 166, 168-69 (2d Cir.2004); Fed. R.Crim.P. 43(a)(3). We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-13\">In its oral pronouncement of sentence, the district court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-14\">There was some dispute \u2014 it was represented by you that you did have your GED, but Probation had difficulty confirming that. So if you\u2019re going to get any kind of employment, I think you need to take steps to see that that has happened, and I\u2019ll make that a condition of supervised release.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b471-15\">Sentencing Tr. at 14. Although Johnson submits that this statement does not clearly require him actually to obtain a GED, it is apparent, even from a cold record, that that was the court\u2019s intent. In any event, it is \u201cwell established\u201d that \u201cthe written judgment [may] resolve genuine ambiguities in the oral sentence.\u201d <em>United States v. Truscello, </em>168 F.3d 61, 62-63 (2d Cir. 1999). Accordingly, Johnson\u2019s arguable identification of ambiguity in the oral pronouncement does not render the written special condition of supervised release invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>\n<em>3. Substantive Reasonableness of Sentence</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b472-4\">Johnson\u2019s 51-month prison sentence falls at the low end of his 51-63 month Guidelines range, derived from an offense level of 17 and criminal history-category of VI. \u201c[I]in the overwhelming majority of cases, a Guidelines sentence will fall comfortably within the broad range of sentences that would be reasonable in the particular circumstances.\u201d <em>United States. v. Eberhard, </em>525 F.3d 175, 179 (2d Cir.2008) (internal quotation marks omitted). This is because \u201cwhere [the sentencing] judge and [Sentencing] Commission both determine that the Guidelines sentence[] is an appropriate sentence for the case at hand, that sentence likely reflects the \u00a7 3553(a) factors.\u201d <em>Rita v. United States, </em>- U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2467, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007) (emphasis in original). Johnson\u2019s sentence warrants no different conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-6\">Johnson argues only that a lesser sentence \u201cwould have met the goals of sentencing\u201d as enumerated in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), given that he had already served time in state prison based on the same conduct for which federal authorities indicted him. Appellant\u2019s Br. at 17. Whether or not we accept defendant\u2019s argument that the state and federal terms of custody imposed on Johnson serve the same goals of sentencing, <em>cf. United States v. Verkhoglyad, </em>516 F.3d 122, 130 &amp; n. 6 (2d Cir.2008) (noting that violation of supervised release could be penalized as \u201cbreach of trust\u201d and, if warranted, \u201cprosecuted separately\u201d), we identify no abuse of discretion in the court\u2019s conclusion that \u201ca sentence at the low end of the range,\u201d Sentencing Tr. at 12, was appropriate to serve the statutory goals of sentencing in his case.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-8\">In sum, because the district court committed no procedural error and defendant\u2019s sentence was not unreasonable, the judgment of conviction is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
