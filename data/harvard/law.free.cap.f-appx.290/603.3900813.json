Simmons\u2019 counsel has filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), stating that, in his view, there are no meritorious issues for appeal. Counsel suggests, however, that the district court abused its discretion in sentencing Simmons to serve three months in a community corrections center. Simmons was advised of his right to file a pro se supplemental brief, but he has not done so. The Government declined to file a brief. Finding no error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-18\">This court will affirm a sentence imposed after revocation or modification of supervised release if it is within the applicable statutory maximum and is not plainly unreasonable. <em>United States v. Crudup, </em>461 F.3d 433, 437, 439-40 (4th Cir. 2006), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 1813, 167 L.Ed.2d 325 (2007). This court explained that it must first assess the sentence for reasonableness, \u201cfollow[ing] generally the procedural and substantive considerations that we employ in our review of original sentences, ... with some necessary modifications to take into account the unique nature of supervised release revocation sentences.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 438-39; <em>see United States v. Finley, </em>531 F.3d 288, 294 (4th Cir.2008) (\u201cIn applying the \u2018plainly unreasonable\u2019 standard, we first determine, using the instructions given in <em>Gall[v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007)], whether a sentence is \u2018unreasonable.\u2019 \u201d). Should this court conclude a sentence is reasonable, it should affirm the sentence. <em>Crudup, </em>461 F.3d at 439. Only if a sentence is found procedurally or substantively unreasonable will this court \u201cdecide whether the sentence is <em>plainly </em>unreasonable.\u201d <footnotemark>*</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>(emphasis in original); <em>see Finley, </em>531 F.3d at 294. Although the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>district court must consider the Chapter 7 policy statements and the requirements of 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 3553(a), 3583 (West 2000 <em>&amp; </em>Supp.2008), \u201cthe [district] court ultimately has broad discretion to revoke its previous sentence and impose a term of imprisonment up to the statutory maximum.\u201d <em>Crudup, </em>461 F.3d at 439 (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b627-5\">Simmons\u2019 counsel questions whether the three-month sentence to be served in a community corrections center is unreasonable. Simmons does not challenge the procedural aspects of his sentence. In reviewing the substantive reasonableness of a sentence for abuse of discretion,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AfY\">the court will, of course, take into account the totality of the circumstances, including the extent of any variance from the Guidelines range____ [I]f the sentence is outside the Guidelines range, the court may not apply a presumption of unreasonableness. It may consider the extent of the deviation, but must give due deference to the district court\u2019s decision that the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, on a whole, justify the extent of the variance.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"aez-dedup-0\"><em>Gall, </em>128 S.Ct. at 597.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-8\">Here, the district court thoroughly stated its reasons for imposing the three month placement. We conclude that the district court\u2019s imposition of the sentence is reasonable. Based on the conclusion that the sentence is reasonable, \u201cit necessarily follows that [Simmons\u2019] sentence is not plainly unreasonable.\u201d <em>Crudup, </em>461 F.3d at 440; <em>see Finley, </em>531 F.3d at 297.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-9\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the record in this case and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. We therefore affirm the district court\u2019s modification of the terms of Simmons\u2019 supervised release. This court requires that counsel inform Simmons, in writing, of the right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If Simmons requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on Simmons. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-11\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b626-15\"> \"[F]or purposes of determining whether an unreasonable sentence is plainly unreasonable, plain is synonymous with clear or, equivalently, obvious.\" <em>Crudup, </em>461 F.3d at 439 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
