Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436, 444-45, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966). After careful consideration of <em>Oregon v. Elstad, </em>470 U.S. 298, 105 S.Ct. 1285, 84 L.Ed.2d 222 (1985), <em>Missouri v. Seibert, </em>542 U.S. 600, 124 S.Ct. 2601, 159 L.Ed.2d 643 (2004), and <em>United States v. Williams, </em>435 F.3d 1148 (9th Cir.2006), the district court appropriately <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>determined that the case fit within <em>Elstad. </em>On the record that was before the district court, the court\u2019s finding that there was no \u201ctwo-step questioning technique based on a deliberate violation of <em>Miranda </em>\u201d was not clearly erroneous. <em>Seibert, </em>542 U.S. at 620, 124 S.Ct. 2601 (Kennedy, J., concurring). Because the district court made the finding by applying a preponderance of evidence standard and did not rely on an absence of evidence from a party bearing the burden of proof, we need not decide what party bears the burden of proof. <em>Cf United States v. Ollie, </em>442 F.3d 1135, 1142-43 (8th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b61-5\">The district court found that the detectives interrogating Phipps at his home thought Phipps was free to go, and were not implementing a <em>Seibert </em>two-step interrogation scheme. The evidence established without contradiction that the police came to the house to execute a search warrant without any prearrangement to interrogate Phipps. Also, the interrogating deputy told Phipps he was free to go and meant it, and asked Phipps for his phone number so that the police could call him later if they had more questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-6\">We held in <em>Williams </em>that a more extensive evaluation considering the details of the contents of the statements is necessary \u201cwhen an interrogator has deliberately employed the two-step strategy.\u201d <em>Williams, </em>435 F.3d at 1160. Because the district court made a finding of fact that the interrogator did not deliberately employ the two-step strategy, and that finding is not clearly erroneous, that <em>Williams </em>analysis was unnecessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b60-17\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
