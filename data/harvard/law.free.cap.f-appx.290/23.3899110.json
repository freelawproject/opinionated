We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-12\">The district court correctly held that Gray failed to satisfy the five-part test necessary to prevail on a Rule 33 motion based on newly discovered evidence. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Crim.P. 33; <em>United States v. Harrington, </em>410 F.3d 598, 601 (9th Cir.2005) (describing five-part test). Gray failed to introduce any evidence supporting her assertion that she exercised due diligence in attempting to retain a forensic psychologist prior to trial. <em>See Harrington, </em>410 F.3d at 601. Moreover, the psychologist\u2019s report does not \u201cindicate that a new trial would probably result in an acquittal.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 601. Gray testified at trial that she could not remember most of the events surrounding the shooting. An expert\u2019s report describing the reasons for her post-shooting amnesia has no bearing on her ultimate guilt or innocence. Accordingly, the district court did not abuse its discretion by denying Gray\u2019s motion for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-15\">Nor did the district court abuse its discretion by failing to order a competency hearing. The district court correctly concluded that Ashley\u2019s inability to remember the events of the shooting did not, alone, create a bona fide doubt about her competence. <em>See United States v. Fernandez, </em>388 F.3d 1199, 1251 (9th Cir.2004) (noting that a trial court must order a competency hearing \u201cif a reasonable judge would have ... a bona fide doubt [about the defendant\u2019s] competence\u201d (internal quotations omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b46-16\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b46-13\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
