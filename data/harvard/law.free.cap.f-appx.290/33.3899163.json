Kilgroe appeals pro se from the district court\u2019s judgment for defendants in his action alleging federal and state law violations in connection with his employment on a United States naval ship. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review de novo. <em>Kimes v. Stone, </em>84 F.3d 1121, 1126 (9th Cir.1996) (dismissal for failure to state a claim); <em>Dark v. Curry, </em>451 F.3d 1078, 1082 n. 2 (9th Cir.2006) (summary judgment). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-20\">The district court properly dismissed Kilgroe\u2019s defamation claims because, under California law, publications in judicial proceedings and communications to an administrative agency are protected from litigation attacking those statements. <em>See </em>Cal. Civ.Code \u00a7 47(b); <em>Moore v. Conliffe, </em>7 Cal.4th 634, 29 Cal.Rptr.2d 152, 871 P.2d 204, 219 (1994) (\u201c[SJtatements made in the course of a private contractual arbitration proceeding are protected by the litigation privilege\u201d); <em>Martin v. Kearney, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>51 Cal.App.3d 309, 124 Cal.Rptr. 281, 282 (1975) (holding that a communication to an official administrative agency, designed to prompt action by that agency, is privileged from tort actions).</p>\n<p id=\"b57-5\">The district court properly dismissed Kilgroe\u2019s abuse of process claim because Kilgroe\u2019s allegations regarding misuse of ship logbook procedures did not demonstrate that defendants misused judicial process. <em>See Adams v. Superior Court, </em>2 Cal.App.4th 521, 530, 3 Cal. Rptr.2d 49 (1992) (explaining that a plaintiff making an abuse of process claim must show that the \u201cprocess\u201d at issue was \u201ctaken pursuant to judicial authority\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b57-6\">The district court properly granted summary judgment on Kilgroe\u2019s age discrimination claim because Kilgroe did not raise a triable issue that defendants\u2019 proffered nondiscriminatory reason for refusing to rehire him was a pretext for age discrimination. <em>See Coleman v. Quaker Oats Co., </em>232 F.3d 1271, 1282 (9th Cir. 2000) (explaining that to survive summary judgment, a plaintiff must create a triable issue as to whether the employer\u2019s proffered reasons for the adverse employment action were pretexts for discrimination in violation of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act).</p>\n<p id=\"b57-7\">The district court properly granted summary judgment on Kilgroe\u2019s disability discrimination claim because Kilgroe did not raise a triable issue that he would have been able to perform the essential functions of his position with a reasonable accommodation. <em>See Cleveland v. Policy Management Systems Corp., </em>526 U.S. 795, 806, 119 S.Ct. 1597, 143 L.Ed.2d 966 (1999) (explaining that a plaintiff making a claim under the Americans with Disabilities Act bears the burden of proving that a reasonable accommodation would have enabled him to perform the essential functions of the position).</p>\n<p id=\"b57-9\">Kilgroe\u2019s remaining contentions are unavailing.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b56-13\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
