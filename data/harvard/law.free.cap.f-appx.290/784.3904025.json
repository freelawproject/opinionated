The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"786\">*786</page-number>district court sentenced Defendant to 235 months in prison. Defendant now appeals both his conviction and sentence. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-5\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-6\">On March 16, 2006, a federal grand jury-issued a Superseding Indictment charging Defendant with the following three counts: (1) Count 1\u2014Conspiring to distribute and possess with intent to distribute five kilograms or more of cocaine and 50 grams or more of cocaine base between 1999 and March 2005, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846; (2) Count 2\u2014Distribution of 50 grams or more of cocaine base on or about October 29, 2003, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1), (b)(l)(A)(iii) and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2; and (3) Count 3\u2014Possession with intent to distribute five grams or more of cocaine base on or about February 25, 2005, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1), (b)(l)(A)(iii) and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2. On November 13, 2006, the case proceeded to trial in the Southern District of Ohio.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-7\">During the course of the trial, the jury heard testimony from three alleged co-conspirators who had pleaded guilty prior to trial: Dante Griffen, Adrian Turner and Tamara Valentine. The majority of this testimony involved each co-conspirator\u2019s numerous drug transactions with Defendant between 1999 and March 2005. Grif-fen, Turner and Valentine each testified that they used Defendant as their primary source of supply for both crack and powder cocaine, which each of them purchased in varying quantities several times per month. The quantities Griffen, Turner and Valentine purchased were \u201cdistribution\u201d quantities; that is, Defendant did not sell them cocaine for personal use but for distribution.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Defendant would also help the co-conspirators cook the cocaine from powder to crack and would \u201cfront\u201d them the drugs with the understanding that he would be re-paid from the proceeds of further drug sales. On at least one occasion, Defendant drove Adrian Turner to a drug transaction, supplied the drugs for that transaction, and later split the proceeds of the transaction with Turner. Finally, each co-conspirator testified regarding his or her plea bargain with the government, including the facts forming the basis of the plea and prior drug sales that may or may not have involved Defendant. On November 16, 2006, the jury found Defendant guilty as to Counts 1 and 2 of the Superseding Indictment and acquitted him as to Count 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-11\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-12\">The district court held a sentencing hearing on March 15, 2007. Pursuant to the Presentence Investigative Report (PSR), Defendant\u2019s advisory Guidelines range was 235 to 293 months in prison; this range was based on an offense level of 36 and a criminal history category III.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Prior to sentencing, Defendant filed a motion for a downward departure as well as numerous objections to the PSR. Defen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"787\">*787</page-number>dant\u2019s motion requested a departure from the advisory Guidelines range due to the 100:1 disparity between crack and powder cocaine (crack/powder disparity). His objections to the PSR challenged all of the relevant conduct findings and maintained his innocence. Defendant also argued that the criminal history category overstated the seriousness of his criminal history.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-5\">At the sentencing hearing, the district court addressed each of Defendant\u2019s sentencing issues but found that a total offense level of 36 and a criminal history category III were accurate. The district court also rejected Defendant\u2019s argument based on the crack/powder disparity as well as the argument relating to his criminal history. Finally, the district court considered all of the sentencing factors outlined in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) in great detail. The district court ultimately found that a sentence within, indeed at the bottom of, the advisory Guidelines range was appropriate and sentenced Defendant to 235 months in prison on each count to be served concurrently.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-7\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-8\">First, Defendant argues that the evidence against him was insufficient to support a conviction for conspiracy. Defendant maintains that the evidence produced at trial supported nothing more than a buyer-seller relationship and that no evidence of conspiracy existed because the three co-conspirators utilized other sources of supply, did not interact with each other, and did not consult with Defendant prior to re-distributing the narcotics. This argument is not persuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-9\">When reviewing the sufficiency of the evidence, we must ask \u201cwhether, after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>United States v. Brown, </em>332 F.3d 363, 372 (6th Cir.2003) (quoting <em>Jackson v. Virginia, </em>443 U.S. 307, 319, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 61 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979)). \u201cA defendant making such a challenge bears a very heavy burden.\u201d <em>United States v. Spearman, </em>186 F.3d 743, 745 (6th Cir.1999). A conviction may be sustained on circumstantial evidence alone, and \u201csuch evidence need not remove every reasonable hypothesis except that of guilt.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>United States v. Vannerson, </em>786 F.2d 221, 225 (6th Cir.1986)).</p>\n<p id=\"b809-11\">In order to establish a conspiracy under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846, \u201cthe government must prove, beyond a reasonable doubt, \u2018(1) an agreement to violate drug laws, (2) knowledge and intent to join the conspiracy, and (3) participation in the conspiracy.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Gibbs, </em>182 F.3d 408, 420 (6th Cir.1999) (quoting <em>United States v. Welch, </em>97 F.3d 142, 148 (6th Cir.1996)). Proof of a formal agreement is not necessary to establish a conspiracy; instead, \u201ca tacit or material understanding among the parties\u201d will suffice. <em>United States v. Pearce, </em>912 F.2d 159, 161 (6th Cir.1990). While a buyer-seller relationship, on its own, is not enough to establish a conspiracy, \u201cevidence of repeat purchases provides evidence of more than a mere buyer-seller relationship.\u201d <em>Brown, </em>332 F.3d at 373; <em>United States v. Moran, </em>984 F.2d 1299, 1303 (1st Cir.1993) (\u201cA pattern of sales for resale between the same persons, together with details supplying the context for the relationship, might well support a finding of conspiracy.\u201d). Indeed, \u201c[d]rug distribution conspiracies are often \u2018chain\u2019 conspiracies such that agreement can be inferred from the interdependence of the enterprise.\u201d <em>United States v. Bourjaily, </em>781 F.2d 539, 544 (6th Cir.1986). In such conspiracies, \u201c[o]ne can assume that participants understand that they are participating in a joint enterprise because success is dependent on the success of those from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"788\">*788</page-number>whom they buy and to whom they sell.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b810-4\">We find ample evidence in this case from which the jury could convict Defendant of the conspiracy charge. The evidence showed that the quantities of cocaine that Defendant sold were clearly not for personal consumption, suggesting a conspiracy to distribute. <em>See Bourjaily, </em>781 F.2d at 545 (finding that \u201c[a] large volume of narcotics creates an inference of a conspiracy\u201d). Defendant, furthermore, made such sales frequently and repeatedly over a long period of time, giving even more credence to the fact that he knew Griffen, Valentine, and Turner were in turn distributing. <em>See Brown, </em>332 F.3d at 373; <em>Moran, </em>984 F.2d at 1303. What is more, Defendant provided necessary assistance to Griffen and Valentine by processing the cocaine for them and helping them break it down into marketable quantities. <em>See United States v. Morris, </em>230 F.3d 1361 (table), 2000 WL 1359627, at *4 (6th Cir. Sept. 14, 2000) (noting that evidence that the defendant helped process powder cocaine to crack supported a finding of conspiracy). Finally, we have recognized that \u201cthe \u2018trust\u2019 involved in \u2018fronting\u2019 drugs under a delayed payment or credit arrangement \u2018suggests more than a buyer-seller arrangement between the parties.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Henley, </em>360 F.3d 509, 514 (6th Cir.2004) (quoting <em>United States v. Humphrey, </em>287 F.3d 422, 435 (6th Cir. 2002)). As we noted in <em>Bourjaily, </em>the jury could infer that Defendant conspired with Griffen, Turner and Valentine based on the evidence that he frequently \u201cfronted\u201d drugs, indicating that Defendant knew his success depended on the success of his buyers. Viewing this evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, there was clearly enough evidence for the jury to find Defendant guilty on the conspiracy charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-5\">Defendant\u2019s reliance on the fact that he did not control to whom Griffen, Turner, and Valentine sold the drugs and the fact that he was not their exclusive source of supply is misplaced. \u201c[T]his Court has never held that conspirators must only buy from and/or sell to one individual in order for a \u2018chain\u2019 conspiracy to exist,\u201d <em>United States v. Caver, </em>470 F.3d 220, 234 (6th Cir.2006), nor is control over distribution an element of conspiracy, <em>see Gibbs, </em>182 F.3d at 420 (recognizing that \u201cno threshold level of organizational sophistication is necessary to the formation of a conspiracy\u201d). Likewise, since it is unnecessary that all members of a conspiracy know each other or participate in all activities in furtherance of the conspiracy, <em>see United States v. Martinez, </em>430 F.3d 317, 332-33 (6th Cir. 2005), Defendant\u2019s argument that Griffen, Turner and Valentine did not know each other is unpersuasive. In sum, the circumstantial evidence showing the interdependence between Defendant and the three co-conspirators over a long period of time and involving large quantities of drugs was sufficient to convict him on the conspiracy charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-6\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-7\">Next, Defendant contends that the district court erred in not preventing Griffen, Turner, and Valentine from testifying as to their involvement in drug transactions in which there was allegedly no testimony linking Defendant to the drugs or the transaction. Defendant claims that this testimony was extremely prejudicial because it could have led the jury to convict him based on his association with persons who are involved in the narcotics trade. However, Defendant concedes that all testimony relating to the conspiracy and the discrete transactions charged in the Superseding Indictment was properly admitted. In response, the government points out that all of the testimony at trial either <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"789\">*789</page-number>linked Defendant to the conspiracy, was probative of his intent, or was brought out in anticipation of cross-examination. We agree with the government.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-5\">Rule 404(b) prohibits the use of \u201c[e]vi-dence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts ... to prove the character of a person in order to show action in conformity therewith.\u201d Fed.R.Evid. 404(b). On the other hand, evidence of \u201cprior bad acts\u201d is admissible, subject to Rule 403, if it is relevant to any material issue other than character. <em>Hud-dleston v. United States, </em>485 U.S. 681, 687, 108 S.Ct. 1496, 99 L.Ed.2d 771 (1988). For instance, \u201cother acts\u201d may constitute relevant impeachment information bearing on a witness\u2019s bias. <em>See id. </em>Moreover, Rule 404(b) does not apply to \u201cother acts\u201d evidence that is \u201cintrinsic\u201d to the charged offense, such as when the other crimes or wrongs evidence is part of a continuing pattern of activity, <em>United States v. Barnes, </em>49 F.3d 1144, 1149 (6th Cir.1995), or where the other acts evidence is essential to \u201cpermit the prosecutor to offer a coherent and comprehensible story regarding the commission of the crime,\u201d <em>United States v. Beckman, </em>298 F.3d 788, 794 (9th Cir .2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b811-6\">The district court\u2019s legal determination concerning the admissibility of other acts evidence for a permissible purpose is reviewed <em>de novo </em>and its determination that the probative value of evidence is not substantially outweighed by the risk of unfair prejudice is reviewed for an abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Myers, </em>123 F.3d 350, 362-63 (6th Cir.1997). Where the defendant has not specifically and contemporaneously objected to such evidence, the district court\u2019s decision is reviewed for plain error. <em>See United States v. Kelly, </em>204 F.3d 652, 655 (6th Cir.2000). Contrary to his assertions, there is no indication in the record that Defendant ever objected to the testimony given by Adrian Turner and Dante Griffen. Therefore, we review the district court\u2019s admission of this testimony for plain error. On the other hand, Defendant did object to Tamara Valentine\u2019s testimony concerning specific drugs. Therefore, we review the district court\u2019s admission of this testimony for an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-8\">We conclude that the district court did not commit plain error in admitting the testimony of Dante Griffen and Adrian Turner. This testimony either provided background information, <em>see United States v. Hardy, </em>228 F.3d 745, 748 (6th Cir.2000) (discussing the propriety of introducing background evidence to complete the story of the charged offense), formed the basis of the conspirators\u2019 plea agreements, see <em>United States v. Townsend, </em>796 F.2d 158, 163 (6th Cir.1986) (noting that \u201c[ijntroduction of the entire plea agreement permits the jury to consider fully the possible conflicting motivations underlying the witnesses] testimony and, thus, enables the jury to more accurately assess the witnesses] credibility\u201d), or was elicited in anticipation of cross-examination and Defendant\u2019s argument that no conspiracy existed due to the lack of exclusivity, <em>see id. </em>at 162 (quoting <em>United States v. Edwards, </em>631 F.2d 1049, 1052 (2d Cir.1980)) (\u201c[C]ourts have consistently recognized that \u2018the elicitation of the fact of the [plea] agreement and the witness\u2019[s] understanding of it ... should be permitted on direct examination in order to anticipate cross-examination by the defendant which might give the jury the unjustified impression that the Government is concealing this relevant fact.\u201d); <em>United States v. Cosentino, </em>844 F.2d 30, 33 (2d Cir.1988) (\u201cIt may sometimes be useful ... to develop impeaching matter in direct examination of a \u2018friendly\u2019 witness in order to deprive an adversary of the psychological advantage of revealing it to the jury for the first time during cross-examination.\u201d). These are permissible purposes under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"790\">*790</page-number>Rule 404(b), and Defendant has not articulated how Turner\u2019s or Griffen\u2019s testimony was unfairly prejudicial. Moreover, as a result of the district court\u2019s timely and specific limiting instructions, any risk of unfair prejudice caused by Turner\u2019s or Griffen\u2019s testimony did not substantially outweigh its probative value. Thus, the district court did not commit plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-4\">Defendant also objects to Tamara Valentine\u2019s testimony concerning a transaction in which she sold 123 grams of cocaine but could not recall from whom she obtained the cocaine. This testimony was properly admitted because this transaction and the amount of cocaine formed the basis for Valentine\u2019s guilty plea and plea agreement. In addition, the district court gave a detailed limiting instruction following Valentine\u2019s testimony and at the close of the case. Therefore, the district court did not abuse its discretion by allowing Valentine\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-5\">In any event, we conclude that any error in allowing these witnesses to testify as to other drug transactions was harmless in light of the overwhelming evidence of Defendant\u2019s guilt. <em>United States v. Murphy, </em>241 F.3d 447, 453 (6th Cir.2001) (finding \u201cany error, if any, in admitting evidence of \u2018other acts\u2019 harmless in light of the overwhelming evidence of Defendant\u2019s guilt\u201d). Moreover, the district court\u2019s limiting instructions significantly reduced the risk of unfair prejudice from such testimony. <em>See Zafiro v. United States, </em>506 U.S. 534, 540, 113 S.Ct. 933, 122 L.Ed.2d 317 (1993) (noting that juries are presumed to follow their instructions). As a consequence, any error did not affect Defendant\u2019s substantial rights and is not a basis for overturning his conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-6\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-7\">Defendant next argues that the district court committed reversible error by not giving a buyer-seller instruction in response to a question from the jury. After four hours of deliberations, the jury sent a note to the district court asking: \u201cIs the act of selling drugs equal to conspiracy?\u201d JA at 281. Upon receiving the note, the district court solicited advice from counsel. Defense counsel initially requested that the court simply respond \u201cno\u201d to the question. <em>Id. </em>at 281-82. However, after some discussion, the district court and counsel for the government and Defendant agreed that the jury was seeking a definition of conspiracy. <em>Id. </em>at 284. Accordingly, counsel and the district court agreed that the appropriate response to the jury\u2019s question was to refer the jury to the district court\u2019s complete instructions on the conspiracy charge. <em>Id. </em>at 285. After further deliberations, the jury convicted Defendant on the conspiracy count. Because counsel for Defendant did not object to the district court\u2019s decision to refer the jury to the original instructions on conspiracy, we review the district court\u2019s response to the jury\u2019s question for plain error. <em>United States v. Combs, </em>33 F.3d 667, 669 (6th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b812-9\">\u201cWhen a jury seeks clarification of particular issues ... the judge should clear away its difficulties with \u2018concrete accuracy.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Nunez, </em>889 F.2d 1564, 1568 (6th Cir.1989) (quoting <em>Bollen-bach v. United States, </em>326 U.S. 607, 612-13, 66 S.Ct. 402, 90 L.Ed. 350 (1946)). It is generally not sufficient \u201cfor the court to rely on more general statements in its prior charge.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Rather, \u201c[i]n response to a jury\u2019s question after it has begun deliberating ... a trial judge may and should make clear the law the jury is bound to apply, though it is not his province to advise the jury of collateral aspects of its decision.\u201d <em>United States v. Rowan, </em>518 F.2d 685, 693 (6th Cir.1975). However, \u201c[i]f the issue that is the subject of an inquiry has been fully covered in the court\u2019s instructions, a reference to or re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"791\">*791</page-number>reading of the instructions may suffice.\u201d <em>Nunez, </em>889 F.2d at 1569. In conspiracy cases such as this, we have concluded that a \u201cbuyer-seller instruction is unnecessary if the district judge has given a complete instruction reciting all the elements of conspiracy and requirements for membership in a conspiracy.\u201d <em>Riggs v. United States, </em>209 F.3d 828, 833 (6th Cir.2000); <em>see also United States v. Asibor, </em>109 F.3d 1023, 1035 (5th Cir.1997) (\u201cSo long as the jury instruction given by the court accurately reflects the law on conspiracy, this court will conclude that the buyer-seller relationship has also been adequately covered.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b813-5\">The district court\u2019s decision to refer the jury back to its original conspiracy instructions was not plain error because the district court\u2019s original instructions fully covered the subject of the jury\u2019s inquiry. The district court\u2019s original instructions provided a comprehensive and accurate definition of conspiracy, focused the jury on the elements of conspiracy and the necessity that there be an agreement to violate the federal drug laws, instructed that \u201cmere presence, association, knowledge, approval or acquiescence is not sufficient to convict a defendant of conspiracy,\u201d and cautioned that \u201cjust because the defendant may have done something that happened to help a conspiracy does not necessarily make him a coconspirator.\u201d JA at 270-80; <em>see United States v. Morris, </em>47 Fed.Appx. 355, 360-61 (6th Cir.2002) (concluding the district court did not err, \u201cplain or otherwise,\u201d in not giving a buyer-seller instruction where the district court \u201cfollowed the Sixth Circuit\u2019s pattern instructions for a conspiracy offense,\u201d which provided \u201ca complete description of such an offense and included] all of the elements necessary for the government to establish a defendant\u2019s involvement in the conspiracy\u201d); <em>United States v. Darnels, </em>135 Fed.Appx. 305, 310 (11th Cir.2005) (finding that the district court\u2019s instruction that \u201cmere presence at the scene of a transaction or event, or the mere fact that certain persons may have associated with each other, and may have assembled together and discussed common aims and interests, does not necessarily establish proof of a conspiracy\u201d adequately covered the defendant\u2019s requested buyer-seller instruction). Defendant does not question the adequacy or correctness of the district court\u2019s original instructions on conspiracy. Consequently, the district court did not commit plain error when it instructed the jury to review its original conspiracy instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-7\">The cases Defendant relies on are distinguishable. In <em>Nunez, </em>we reversed the defendant\u2019s conviction where, unlike the present case, neither the district court\u2019s original instructions nor its supplemental instructions addressed the subject matter of the jury\u2019s question. <em>See Nunez, </em>889 F.2d at 1569-70. Defendant also relies on the Seventh Circuit\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Thomas, </em>150 F.3d 743 (7th Cir. 1998). But as counsel for Defendant readily conceded during oral argument, the propriety of a jury instruction depends on the unique facts of the particular case; and unlike this case, where the evidence established far more than a buyer-seller relationship, the totality of the government\u2019s evidence in <em>Thomas </em>showed, at most, three discrete transactions between the defendant and a government witness involving small quantities of cocaine. <em>Id. </em>at 745. <em>But see United, States v. Askew, </em>403 F.3d 496, 505 (7th Cir.2005) (concluding that the district court did not err in failing to give a buyer-seller instruction <em>sua sponte </em>where it would not have changed the outcome of the trial, \u201cconsidering the relative strength of the evidence against [the defendant]\u201d). Based on the facts of this case and the district court\u2019s complete and accurate jury instructions on the law of conspiracy, we conclude that it was not plain error for the district court to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"792\">*792</page-number>refer the jury back to its original instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-4\">D.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-5\">Finally, Defendant challenges the district court\u2019s sentence on three grounds. First, Defendant argues that a criminal history category III overstates the seriousness of his criminal history. With respect to this argument, Defendant challenges the district court\u2019s decision to deny a downward departure and its effect on the length of his sentence. Second, Defendant contends that his sentence is unreasonable because the district court did not categorically reject the 100:1 crack/powder disparity contained in the advisory Guidelines. As a result, Defendant contends that his sentence is unconstitutional and unreasonably long. Finally, Defendant argues that a sentence of 235 months in prison is unreasonably high in light of the sentences given to other co-conspirators.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-6\">We review the district court\u2019s sentence for procedural and substantive reasonableness. <em>See United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 261, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005); <em>United States v. Williams, </em>432 F.3d 621, 623 (6th Cir.2005). A reviewing court must give due deference to a district court\u2019s sentencing decision and may not reverse simply because it would have imposed a different sentence. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>- U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597-98, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). Because Defendant\u2019s sentence is within the advisory Guidelines range, we presume it is reasonable. <em>Rita v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2462, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007). We conclude that Defendant has failed to rebut this presumption and that his sentence is neither procedurally nor substantively unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-11\">1.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-12\">Defendant contends that the district court erred when it refused to grant a downward departure because his criminal history category substantially over-represented the seriousness of his criminal history. Notably, Defendant does not appeal the district court\u2019s calculation of the criminal history category; instead, Defendant merely argues that the district court should have exercised its discretion under the advisory Guidelines and departed from this otherwise correct calculation. This argument has no merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-14\">Under the Guidelines, a district judge may grant a downward departure, \u201c[i]f reliable information indicates that the defendant\u2019s criminal history category substantially over-represents the seriousness of the defendant\u2019s criminal history....\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.3(b). We have held that a refusal to grant a downward departure pursuant to \u00a7 4A1.3(b) of the Guidelines is not reviewable \u201cunless the record reflects that the district court was not aware of or did not understand its discretion to make such a departure.\u201d <em>United States v. Puckett, </em>422 F.3d 340, 344 (6th Cir.2005) (confirming that this standard survived the change in the Guidelines after Booker); <em>accord United States v. O\u2019Non, </em>268 Fed.Appx. 454, 457 (6th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b814-15\">The record shows that the district court heard Defendant\u2019s argument that his criminal history category over-represented the seriousness of his criminal history, considered it, and rejected it as a basis for a downward departure. In doing so, the district court clearly recognized its authority to depart and simply declined to do so based on the evidence presented. Therefore, the district court\u2019s decision not to depart pursuant to \u00a7 4A1.3(b) of the Guidelines is not reviewable.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-16\">Defendant\u2019s argument also lacks merit to the extent that he argues that the district court should have given more consideration to any over-representation of his criminal history under \u00a7 3553(a). The district court clearly considered Defendant\u2019s</p>\n<p id=\"b815-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"793\">*793</page-number>argument, finding that Defendant\u2019s criminal history did not involve violence and considering it a \u201cpoint well made.\u201d JA at 336-37. Nevertheless, the district court determined that the lack of violence in Defendant\u2019s past did not merit a lower sentence when considered against other \u00a7 3553(a) factors such as the seriousness of the instant offense. <em>Id. </em>Therefore, the district court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to vary from the advisory Guidelines range based on Defendant\u2019s criminal history.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-5\">2.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-6\">Defendant next challenges the propriety of his sentence based on the 100:1 crack/powder disparity. Namely, Defendant argues that the crack/powder disparity is unconstitutional and that by relying on the disparity when formulating his sentence, the district court fashioned a sentence that is greater than necessary to achieve the purposes of sentencing outlined in \u00a7 3553(a). Defendant urges us to remand this case for resentencing in light of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Kim-brough v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 558, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b815-8\">Defendant\u2019s constitutional argument is unpersuasive. We have consistently held that the crack/powder disparity withstands constitutional scrutiny, including challenges based on due process, equal protection, and the Eighth Amendment. <em>See United States v. Blair, </em>214 F.3d 690, 702 (6th Cir.2000), <em>cert. denied, </em>531 U.S. 880, 121 S.Ct. 191, 148 L.Ed.2d 132 (2000); <em>United States v. Bingham, </em>81 F.3d 617, 630-31 (6th Cir.1996) (equal protection); <em>United States v. Hill, </em>79 F.3d 1477, 1488-89 (6th Cir.1996) (Eighth Amendment and equal protection); <em>United States v. Pickett, </em>941 F.2d 411, 418-19 (6th Cir.1991) (Eighth Amendment and substantive due process). <em>Kimbrough </em>said nothing to suggest otherwise and provides no reason to reconsider our constitutional rulings on the facts of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-10\">Next, Defendant maintains that the district court erred by using the crack/powder disparity when calculating his advisory Guidelines range. However, the district court was obligated to do so. <em>See United States v. Asher, </em>239 Fed.Appx. 180, 184 (6th Cir.2007). The Supreme Court has made clear that the starting point of a reasonable sentence is a correct calculation of the advisory Guidelines range. <em>See Kimbrough, </em>128 S.Ct. at 574. \u201cOnly after computing the guidelines range using the correct 100:1 ratio does the district judge have discretion to impose a sentence that is above or below that range.\u201d <em>Asher, </em>239 Fed.Appx. at 184 (quoting <em>United States v. Wallace, </em>458 F.3d 606, 611 (7th Cir.2006)) (internal quotation marks omitted). The district court properly calculated Defendant\u2019s advisory Guidelines range based on the correct Guidelines, which included the crack/powder disparity. Therefore, the district court did not err in this regard.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-11\">Defendant\u2019s final argument relates to the district court\u2019s discretion to vary from the advisory Guidelines range based on the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. Defendant argues that the district court should have sentenced him below the advisory Guidelines range based solely on the fact that the Guidelines range was calculated using the 100:1 crack/powder disparity. In other words, the district court did not accord proper weight to the pervasive criticism of the crack/powder disparity. This argument is also not persuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-12\">In <em>Kimbrough, </em>the Supreme Court stated that \u201cit would not be an abuse of discretion for the district court to conclude when sentencing <em>a particular </em>defendant that the crack/powder disparity yields a sentence \u2018greater than necessary1 to achieve \u00a7 3553(a)\u2019s purposes, even in a mine-run case.\u201d <em>Kimbrough, </em>128 S.Ct. at 575 (em<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"794\">*794</page-number>phasis added). According to the court, the ultimate question was \u201cwhether the sentence was <em>reasonable </em>\u2014 i e., whether the District Judge abused his discretion in determining that the \u00a7 3553(a) factors supported a sentence of [15 years] and justified a substantial deviation from the Guidelines range.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 576 (quoting <em>Gall, </em>128 S.Ct. at 600) (internal quotation marks omitted). In affirming the sentence, the court reaffirmed its mandate that \u201cdistrict courts must treat the Guidelines as the \u2018starting point and the initial benchmark\u2019 \u201d when formulating a reasonable sentence. <em>Id. </em>at 574. Specifically, the court noted that \u201cthe [district court] did not purport to establish a ratio of its own\u201d but \u201cappropriately framed its final determination in line with \u00a7 3553(a)\u2019s overarching instruction.... \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 576. As such, the court did not hold that the crack/powder disparity, or a sentence based on the disparity, was unreasonable <em>per se; </em>the Guidelines are instead merely the starting point for a nuanced assessment of each individual case and the appropriateness of the Guidelines sentence must be judged against the other factors in \u00a7 3553(a). <em>Id. </em>at 570 (\u201cIn sum, while the statute still requires a court to give respectful consideration to the Guidelines ... <em>Booker </em>\u2018permits the court to tailor the sentence in light of other statutory concerns as well.\u2019 \u201d). Thus, the Supreme Court made clear that the district court\u2019s authority to deviate from the crack/powder disparity was not based on the disparity itself or the court\u2019s assessment, in isolation, of the rationales behind the disparity but the district court\u2019s overarching duty under \u00a7 3553(a) to craft a sentence that is sufficient but not greater than necessary to achieve \u00a7 3553(a)\u2019s purposes. Stated differently, \u201ca district court may not employ a \u2018rubber stamp\u2019 approach that categorically rejects the crack/powder disparity without an individual assessment of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and the facts of a particular case.\u201d <em>United States v. </em>Gunter, 527 F.3d 282, 286 (3d Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b816-5\">Consistent with <em>Kimbrough, </em>our precedent permits a district court to vary from the advisory Guidelines based on a disagreement with the crack/powder disparity, not simply for the sake of disagreement, but where the district court concludes that the crack/powder disparity produces a sentence that is greater than necessary in light of all the other considerations enumerated in \u00a7 3553(a). We have recognized that \u201cwhile a departure from the 100:1 ratio may well be <em>reasonable in a particular case, </em>applying the ratio does not, <em>ipso facto, </em>make a sentence unreasonable.... \u201d <em>Caver, </em>470 F.3d at 249 (emphasis added). Thus, a district court is not permitted to categorically reject the advisory Guidelines but must do so based on a reasoned disagreement tied to the sentencing considerations in \u00a7 3553(a). <em>See Kimbrough, </em>128 S.Ct. at 575-76 (noting that the district court \u201cproperly homed in on the particular circumstances of Kimbrough\u2019s case\u201d). Necessarily then, a district court may appropriately decide to not deviate from the Guidelines where it does not find that the factors in \u00a7 3553(a) justify a different result, which is precisely what occurred in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-6\">Defendant\u2019s arguments on appeal are essentially identical to those he presented to the district court in his motion for a downward departure and at the sentencing hearing. Defendant explained in great detail that the original rationales for the crack/powder disparity have largely been undermined and argued that his sentence should be shorter because it was based, in part, on this disparity. However, Defendant did not articulate any facts or circumstances to suggest that the crack/powder disparity produced an unreasonable sentence in this particular case. In essence, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"795\">*795</page-number>Defendant asked the district court, and now asks this Court, to categorically reject the crack/powder disparity without considering his individual circumstances. <em>Kim-brough </em>does not permit such a result.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-5\">Notwithstanding Defendant\u2019s argument, the district court gave appropriate consideration to the crack/powder disparity. When viewing the sentencing hearing as a whole, along with the PSR and the parties\u2019 objections and responses, it is clear that the district court was aware of its authority to vary from the Guidelines based on a reasoned disagreement with the crack/powder disparity and simply concluded that such a variance was not warranted in light of the other \u00a7 3553(a) factors. Importantly, in rejecting Defendant\u2019s invitation to ignore the advisory Guidelines, the district court did not, as Defendant insinuates, treat the Guidelines as mandatory. The district court recognized \u201cthat the guidelines are <em>just one element </em>that I take into consideration, and they <em>shouldn\u2019t be given any more special weight </em>than that of these [\u00a7 3553(a) ] elements I\u2019m reviewing right now.\u201d JA at 339 (emphasis added). Thereafter, the district court considered Defendant\u2019s argument regarding the crack/powder disparity and rejected it, concluding that \u201ctaking into consideration the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, the facts of this particular case, and the presentence investigation report, as well as the professional arguments made by both counsel, the Court finds that the sentence to be imposed is sufficient but not greater than necessary to comply with the purposes of sentencing in this matter.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 342. Thus, the district court carefully considered the crack/powder disparity as it applied to this case and rejected it as a basis for imposing a lower sentence because the Guidelines sentence comported with the overall goals of sentencing. This is all that is required of a sentencing court. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Vowell, </em>516 F.3d 503, 509-13 (6th Cir.2008) (noting that it could not \u201cask more of a district court, in terms of weighing the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and explaining the reasons for its sentence\u201d where the court expressly considered the advisory Guidelines, the parties\u2019 arguments, and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, and explained why its sentence was sufficient but not greater than necessary in relation to each consideration).</p>\n<p id=\"b817-8\">Because the district court did not treat the crack/powder disparity as mandatory and weighed the disparity along with the other pertinent \u00a7 3553(a) factors, we conclude that Defendant\u2019s sentence is not unreasonable. After such a thorough and thoughtful sentencing analysis, it is highly unlikely that <em>Kimbrough\u2019s </em>permissive holding would change the district court\u2019s sentencing decision.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b817-9\">3.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-10\">Defendant lastly argues that his sentence is unreasonable when compared to the sentences given to Dante Griffen, Adrian Turner and Tamara Valentine. Defendant maintains that the district court did not give appropriate weight to the difference between his 235-month sentence and the shorter sentences received by his co-conspirators. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-11\">Section 3553(a)(6) requires the sentencing court to consider \u201cthe need to avoid unwarranted sentence disparities among <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"796\">*796</page-number>defendants with similar records who have been found guilty of similar conduct.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3558(a)(6); <em>United States v. Co-natser, </em>514 F.3d 508, 521 (6th Cir.2008). This factor \u201cconcerns <em>national </em>disparities between defendants with similar criminal histories convicted of similar conduct \u2014 not disparities between codefendants.\u201d <em>Conat-ser, </em>514 F.3d at 521 (emphasis in original). \u201cDisparities between the sentences of co-conspirators can exist for valid reasons, such as differences in criminal histories, the offenses of conviction, or one cocon-spirator\u2019s decision to plead guilty and cooperate with the government.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 522.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-4\">The record shows that the district court gave significant consideration to the sentencing disparities in this case and nationally, distinguished Defendant\u2019s conduct from that of his co-conspirators (specifically noting the fact that the co-conspirators pleaded guilty and received credit for cooperating with the government), and properly exercised its discretion. Accordingly, it was not unreasonable for the district court to conclude that the disparities among co-conspirators in this case were not unwarranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-6\">For the foregoing reasons, Defendant\u2019s conviction and sentence are AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b808-8\">. According to Griffen, and corroborated by Agent Paris Wilson of the Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco and Firearms, quantities measured in ounces and above are known to be \"distribution quantities\u201d and not for personal use. JA at 62, 236. Griffen ordinarily purchased drugs from Defendant every other week in quantities ranging from one ounce to half a kilogram. <em>Id. </em>at 58-62, 65, 76. Valentine purchased from four-and-a-half to nine ounces of crack or powder cocaine from Defendant as many as four times per week. <em>Id. </em>at 195-96, 201. By the time Turner was arrested, he was purchasing up to an ounce at a time, two times per week. <em>Id. </em>at 141-42.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b808-14\">.

Accordingly, given our disposition of this issue and the fact that the district court will have an opportunity to reconsider its sentence, we see no reason to remand this case for resentencing.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
