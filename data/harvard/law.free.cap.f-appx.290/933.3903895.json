Thus, the appeal is submitted on the briefs and the record. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 34(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b956-12\">ORDER</p>\n<p id=\"b956-13\">Albert Luckey sought to take advantage of Amendment 706 to the United States Sentencing Guidelines Manual, which retroactively reduced the base-offense levels for crack-cocaine offenses. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c). The district court denied his motion to reduce his sentence pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2), and Mr. Luckey appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b956-14\">We affirm because Amendment 706 does not apply to Mr. Luckey\u2019s sentence. He pleaded guilty to possessing more than 50 grams of cocaine base and had a prior felony drug conviction, which means that by statute his mandatory-minimum penalty was 240 months\u2019 imprisonment. <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(l)(A)(iii). That was greater than the range Mr. Luckey otherwise would have faced (188 to 235 months), and so the statutory minimum became Mr. Luckey\u2019s guideline sentence. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5Gl.l(b). Section 3582(c)(2) provides that when the Sentencing Commission lowers a prisoner\u2019s guidelines range a court may reduce the sentence only \u201cif such a reduction is consistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d The application notes to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10 provide that a reduction \u201cis not consistent with this policy statement\u201d if it would not lower the applicable guideline range because of a \u201cstatutory provision (e.g., a statutory mandatory minimum term of imprisonment).\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, comment. (n.l(A)); <em>see also United States v. Lawrence, </em>535 F.3d 631, 636-37 (7th Cir.2008) (recognizing that court\u2019s authority to reduce sentences under \u00a7 3852(c) is limited by Commission\u2019s policy statements); <em>United States v. Jones, </em>523 F.3d 881, 882 (8th Cir.2008). Furthermore, aside from two exceptions not applicable here, district courts may not impose a sentence below a statutory mandatory minimum. <em>See Kimbrough v. United </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"935\">*935</page-number><em>States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 558, 574, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007) (\u201c[A]s to crack cocaine sentences in particular, we note [that] ... district courts are constrained by the mandatory m\u00ednimums Congress prescribed in the 1986 Act.\u201d); <em>United States v. Harris, </em>536 F.3d 798, 813 (2008) (\u201cWhile the sentencing guidelines may be only advisory for district judges, congressional legislation is not.\u201d); <em>United States v. Simpson, </em>337 F.3d 905, 909 (7th Cir.2003) (\u201cThe only provisions allowing for departure from a statutory minimum are 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3553(e) and (f).\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b957-6\">Mr. Luckey also argues in his reply brief that the information the government filed that listed his previous felony drug conviction for purposes of applying the mandatory minimum would have violated 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 851(a)(2) under the revised guidelines. He misunderstands the statute, but even if there might otherwise have been a violation, because he was charged in an indictment in the present case, there could be no \u00a7 851(a)(2) violation. <em>See United States v. Jackson, </em>189 F.3d 502, 512 (7th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b957-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
