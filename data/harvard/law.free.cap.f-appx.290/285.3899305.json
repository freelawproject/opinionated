He now appeals his sentence, contending that the district court incorrectly calculated his sentence range under the Sentencing Guidelines because it held him accountable for pornographic images that he had deleted from his computer before he knew he was under criminal investigation. Accordingly, the court should have calculated his sentence range to include only the images that were currently accessible to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-4\">Appellant did not object to the district court\u2019s decision to hold him accountable for the deleted images. We therefore review the court\u2019s decision for plain error.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We will correct a plain error when (1) there is an error, (2) that is plain, and (3) that affects substantial rights. <em>Bennett, </em>472 F.3d at 831. If all three conditions are met, we may then \u201cexercise its discretion to notice a forfeited error, but only if (4) the error seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>United States v. Rodriguez, </em>398 F.3d 1291, 1298 (11th Cir.2005). Plain error means an error that is \u201cclear\u201d or \u201cobvious.\u201d <em>United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 734, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 1777, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993). \u201cAt a minimum, court of appeals cannot correct an error ... unless the error is clear under current law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cThe error must be so \u2018plain\u2019 the trial judge and prosecutor were derelict in countenancing it, even absent the defendant\u2019s timely assistance in detecting it.\u201d <em>United States v. Frady, </em>456 U.S. 152, 163, 102 S.Ct. 1584, 1592, 71 L.Ed.2d 816 (1982). \u201cWhen neither the Supreme Court nor this Court has resolved an issue, and other circuits are split on it, there can be no plain error in regard to that issue.\u201d <em>United States v. Moriarty, </em>429 F.3d 1012, 1019 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b308-7\">Given the lack of binding authority on the Guidelines-calculation-issue presented, we conclude that the district court did not plainly err by including previously deleted images in the total number of images for purposes of calculating Walker\u2019s advisory guideline range.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b308-5\">. \u201cIt is the law of this circuit that a failure to object to allegations of fact in a [presentence investigation report] admits those facts for sentencing purposes\u201d and precludes the argument that such facts contained error. <em>United States v. Wade, </em>458 F.3d 1273, 1277 (11th Cir.2006). \u201cChallenges to the [report] must be asserted with specificity and clarity ... [otherwise the objection is waived\u201d. <em>United States v. Bennett, All </em>F.3d 825, 832 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
