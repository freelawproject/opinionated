He argues that the district court clearly erred in denying him a minor-role adjustment under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2(b). Velasco contends that he was a mere courier who was substantially less culpable than other participants in the offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-25\">Following <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), sentences are reviewed for reasonableness in light of the sentencing factors in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). <em>See United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 519-20 (5th Cir. 2005). Pursuant to <em>Gall v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 586, 596-97, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007), this court must determine whether the sentence imposed is procedurally sound, including whether the calculation of the advisory guidelines range is correct, and whether the sentence imposed is substantively reasonable. Review is for an abuse of discretion. <em>Id. </em>at 597. \u201cNeither <em>Gall, Rita v. United States, </em>[\u2014 U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007) ], nor <em>Kimbrough v.

Cisneros-Gutierrez, </em>517 F.3d 751, 764 (5th Cir.2008). We review the district court\u2019s determination of a defendant\u2019s role in the offense for clear error. <em>United States v. Villanueva, </em>408 F.3d 193, 203 n. 9 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b709-5\">To be eligible for a minor-role adjustment, a defendant \u201cmust have been peripheral to the advancement of the illicit activity.\u201d <em>United States v. Miranda, </em>248 F.3d 434, 447 (5th Cir.2001). In light of Velasco\u2019s actual involvement in importing and possessing 71.75 kilograms of marijuana, the district court did not clearly err in denying an adjustment for a minor role in the offense. <em>See United States v. Atanda, </em>60 F.3d 196, 199 (5th Cir.1995); <em>United States v. Gallegos, </em>868 F.2d 711, 712-13 (5th Cir.1989). Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b708-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
