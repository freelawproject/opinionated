We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D), and we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b24-23\">We have jurisdiction to consider whether Osmancevie\u2019s conviction of \u201cSexual Penetration by Foreign Object\u201d under California Penal Code \u00a7 289(a)(1) constituted an aggravated felony, because this is a question of law. <em>See Valencia v. Gonzales, </em>439 F.3d 1046, 1048 (9th Cir.2006). Osmancevic has not waived the issue, because the BIA addressed it in its June 9, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"3\">*3</page-number>2006 decision. <em>See Ma v. Ashcroft, </em>361 F.3d 553, 558 (9th Cir.2004). We review de novo, giving deference where appropriate to the BIA\u2019s legal determinations. <em>See Ortiz-Magana v. Mukasey, </em>523 F.3d 1042, 1046 (9th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b25-5\">Osmancevic\u2019s conviction (for which he received a one-year sentence) qualifies as a crime of violence under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(F) and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 16(a). California Penal Code \u00a7 289(a)(1) is entitled \u201cForcible Acts of Sexual Penetration,\u201d requires that the act be accomplished against the victim\u2019s will, and includes as an element force or threatened force. It is on California\u2019s list of violent felonies, <em>see </em>CaLPenal Code \u00a7 667.5(c)(ll), and \u201cwhen a state defines a crime as a \u2018violent felony,\u2019 we may decide that a crime is a crime of violence under \u00a7 16.\u201d <em>Lisbey v. Gonzales, </em>420 F.3d 930, 933 (9th Cir.2005). Further, under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 16(b), Osmancevic\u2019s offense is a felony involving a substantial risk of the use of physical force. <em>See id. </em>at 933 (where sexual battery crime involves \u201cnon-consent\u201d of the victim and an additional element of restraint, it is a crime of violence under 16(b)).</p>\n<p id=\"b25-6\">We lack jurisdiction to review the agency\u2019s decision that Osmancevic\u2019s conviction was \u201ca particularly serious crime\u201d under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3)(B). <em>See Unuakhaulu v. Gonzales, </em>416 F.3d 931, 935 (9th Cir.2005) (as amended). The IJ applied the correct legal standard. <em>See Afridi v. Gonzales, </em>442 F.3d 1212, 1218 (9th Cir.2006). Osmancevic\u2019s no contest plea is a conviction of the underlying charges for deportation purposes, <em>see Ruis-Rubio v. INS, </em>380 F.2d 29, 30 (9th Cir.1967) (per curiam), and he cannot now claim he was innocent of the charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b25-7\">Finally, we have jurisdiction to consider whether substantial evidence supported the decision to deny deferral of removal under CAT. <em>See Lemus-Galvan v. Mukasey, </em>518 F.3d 1081, 1082 (9th Cir. 2008) (jurisdiction); <em>Singh v. Ashcroft, </em>351 F.3d 435, 442 (9th Cir.2003) (reversal only if \u201cevidence is so compelling that no reasonable fact finder could have failed to find the requisite likelihood of torture\u201d). Os-mancevic bore the burden to present evidence establishing \u201csubstantial grounds\u201d that he was in danger of torture upon his removal to Bosnia-Herzegovina and that internal relocation was not a possibility. <em>See Hasan v. Ashcroft, </em>380 F.3d 1114, 1122-23 (9th Cir.2004). The IJ acted within his discretion to admit the testimony of the government\u2019s expert witness, and credited his testimony only so far as it was consistent with documents in evidence. It did not violate due process to require Os-mancevic to establish \u201csubstantial grounds\u201d as required by CAT. <em>See Ka-malthas v. INS, </em>251 F.3d 1279, 1284 (9th Cir.2001) (\u201cA petitioner carries this burden whenever he or she presents evidence establishing \u2018substantial grounds for believing that he [or she] would be in danger of being subjected to torture\u2019 in the country of removal, <em>U.N. Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment </em>art. 3, para. .1.\u201d). Substantial evidence supported the conclusion that Osmancevic could relocate within Bosnia-Herzegovina.</p>\n<p id=\"b25-9\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b24-16\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
