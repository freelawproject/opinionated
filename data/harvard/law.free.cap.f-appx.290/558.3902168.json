On appeal, counsel has filed a brief under <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), alleging that there are no meritorious claims on appeal but raising the following issues: (1) whether Ageh\u2019s convictions are supported by sufficient evidence, and (2) whether the district court committed reversible error by denying Ageh\u2019s request for an alternative jury instruction. Ageh was notified of his right to file a pro se supplemental brief, but has failed to do so. For the reasons that follow, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-5\">First, viewing the evidence as required, we find that any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crimes beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Glas-ser v. United States, </em>315 U.S. 60, 80, 62 S.Ct. 457, 86 L.Ed. 680 (1942); <em>United States v. Burgos, </em>94 F.3d 849, 862-63 (4th Cir.1996). Second, we find no abuse of discretion in the district court\u2019s refusal to give Ageh\u2019s proffered jury instruction. <em>United States v. Abbas, </em>74 F.3d 506, 513 (4th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b581-6\">We have examined the entire record in this case in accordance with the requirements of <em>Anders, </em>and find no meritorious issues for appeal. Accordingly, we affirm. This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-8\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
