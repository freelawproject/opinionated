For the reasons that follow, we will affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-13\">This lawsuit arises out of events beginning on May 21, 2003, when Travonne, the son of Erica Brown and stepson of Kevin Brown, was brought to Berks County Children and Youth Services (\u201cBCCYS\u201d) by his maternal aunt. Based on the aunt\u2019s allegations that Kevin Brown had physically abused his stepson, Tina Daniels, a BCCYS caseworker, initiated an investigation. Daniels attempted to contact both of the Appellants by phone and followed up with separate letters to each of them the following week explaining that Travonne and his sister were residing with their maternal grandmother and that \u201ca plan for guardianship or custody needs to be decided as soon as possible in order to resolve the matter.\u201d A hearing was scheduled for June 25, 2003, approximately four weeks later, and was then continued until July 9, 2003 at Erica Brown\u2019s request, with Tra-vonne to remain with his maternal grandmother until further notice. At the July 9 hearing, the Juvenile Court directed the family to begin counseling and ordered that Travonne remain with his grandmother under the \u201cprotective supervision\u201d of BCCYS.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-15\">On August 11, 2003, Appellants filed the underlying complaint in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. In it, they alleged that BCCYS, Daniels, and Supervisor Brandy Neider violated their substantive due process rights by examining Travonne without their consent, notifying Kevin Brown\u2019s employer of the abuse allegations, and harassing them during the healing process. They further alleged that Appellees violated their procedural due process rights by taking Travonne into custody without promptly conducting a hearing. On Appel-lees\u2019 motion, the District Court dismissed the action for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted, and in the alternative, held that Appellees were entitled to qualified immunity. On appeal, we affirmed in part, upholding the dismissal of BCCYS, Neider, and Appellants\u2019 substantive due process claims from the action. We vacated and remanded the District Court\u2019s judgment with respect to claims that Daniels violated Appellants\u2019 procedural due process rights, holding that Appellants had sufficiently alleged a violation of their procedural due process rights to survive a motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-16\">Following our remand, the District Court held a two-day trial in which Erica Brown represented herself. During the course of the trial, Brown elicited testimony from Kevin Brown and other family members regarding the events of May 21. The testimony indicated that, upon learning that her children were at her mother\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>house, Brown went to the police station that evening to request police assistance in getting the children back. She was told that there was a protection from abuse (\u201cPFA\u201d) order in place, and that the police could not assist her. All of her witnesses testified that the Browns returned from the police station unsuccessful in getting their children back. The remainder of the testimony at trial focused on the emotional, psychological and economic damages suffered by the Brown family as a result of the children\u2019s removal from their home. Appellants did not call any representatives of the police department or BCCYS as witnesses. At the close of Appellants\u2019 case, Daniels moved for judgment as a matter of law, which motion the District Court granted in an oral opinion. Appellants then filed a motion for reconsideration which the District Court denied in a written opinion and order entered on June 19, 2006. Appellants timely filed a notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-4\">Appellants challenge four of the District Court\u2019s rulings in this appeal: (i) its grant of Appellee\u2019s motion for judgment as a matter of law pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 50(a); (ii) its grant of Ap-pellee\u2019s motion <em>in limine </em>to dismiss Kevin Brown from the action for lack of standing; (iii) its denial of Appellants\u2019 motion <em>in limine </em>to exclude certain BCCYS files from the trial; and (iv) its denial of Appellants\u2019 motion to amend their complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-5\">We have jurisdiction over this appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We note first that Appellants failed to order a transcript of the proceedings as required by Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 10(b)(1). Appellee has urged us to dismiss Appellants\u2019 first three claims on this ground. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 3(a)(2); <em>see also Horner Equip. Intern., Inc. v. Seascape Pool Ctr., Inc., </em>884 F.2d 89, 92-93 (3d Cir.1989). However, because Appellants are proceeding <em>pro se </em>and <em>in forma pauperis, </em>we ordered the court reporter to prepare a transcript of the trial testimony pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 753(b) &amp; 1915(c). Accordingly, we will not dismiss Appellants\u2019 claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-7\">We exercise plenary review over a District Court\u2019s entry of judgment as a matter of law. <em>See Goodman v. Pennsylvania Turnpike Comm\u2019n, </em>293 F.3d 655, 664-65 (3d Cir.2002). As with grants of summary judgment, the reviewing court \u201cmust draw all reasonable inferences in favor of the nonmoving party, and it may not make credibility determinations or weigh the evidence.\u201d <em>Reeves v. Sanderson Plumbing Prods., </em>530 U.S. 133, 150, 120 S.Ct. 2097, 147 L.Ed.2d 105 (2000). Generally, a Rule 50 motion should be granted only if the evidence is not sufficient for a jury reasonably to find liability. <em>Lightning Lube, Inc. v. Witco Corp., 4 </em>F.3d 1153, 1166 (3d Cir. 1993); <em>see also </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 50(a) (permitting entry of judgment as a matter of law when \u201ca party has been fully heard on an issue during a jury trial and the court finds that a reasonable jury would not have a legally sufficient evidentiary basis to find for the party on that issue\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b492-8\">At the close of Appellants\u2019 case, Appel-lee moved for, and the District Court entered, judgment as a matter of law. In its written opinion and order denying Appellants\u2019 motion for reconsideration, the District Court explained that it had granted Appellee\u2019s motion based on its conclusion that Appellants had failed to present sufficient evidence to support a finding that them son had been taken into \u201cprotective custody\u201d within the meaning of 23 Pa. Cons.Stat. Ann. \u00a7 6315, or, assuming he was in \u201cprotective custody,\u201d that Daniels had acted unreasonably in not initiating a hearing within 72 hours. Appellants contest the District Court\u2019s conclusion, arguing that under 55 Pa.Code \u00a7 3490.57, placement of children with relatives consti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>tutes protective custody, and therefore they should have been afforded a hearing within 72 hours.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-5\">Appellants\u2019 claims are grounded in the Child Protective Services Law (\u201cCPSL\u201d), 23 Pa. Cons.Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 6301-6386. Section 6315 permits a child to be taken into \u201cprotective custody\u201d if it is immediately necessary for the child\u2019s protection. That section further requires that the parents be immediately informed of the whereabouts of their children, specifies that an informal court hearing must be held within 72 hours to determine whether \u201cto allow the child to remain in the home would be contrary to the welfare of the child,\u201d 23 Pa. Cons.Stat. \u00a7 6315(d); <em>see also </em>42 Pa. Cons.Stat. Ann. \u00a7 6332(a), and defines the \u201cplace of detention\u201d as \u201can appropriate medical facility, foster home or other appropriate facility approved by the department for this purpose.\u201d 23 Pa. Cons.Stat. \u00a7 6315(e). The section of the Pennsylvania Code referred to by Appellants in their brief provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AN2\">A child taken into protective custody may be placed only in the following locations:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-6\">(1) A hospital, if hospitalization is medically necessary in the opinion of the attending physician.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-7\">(2) A home of a relative of the child or other individual who has a significant relationship with the child or the child\u2019s family. The home shall be approved by the county agency for this purpose.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-8\">(3) A foster family home approved by a licensed foster family care agency.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-9\">(4) A licensed residential child care facility.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b493-10\">55 Pa.Code \u00a7 3490.57(d). That section further provides that protective custody \u201cmay not be maintained longer than 72 hours without an informal hearing under section 6332 of the Juvenile act (relating to informal hearing).\u201d 55 Pa.Code \u00a7 3490.57(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b493-11\">Against this backdrop, Appellants maintained throughout trial that they were not afforded a hearing within 72 hours of Tra-vonne\u2019s placement by Appellee with his grandmother, and therefore, their procedural due process rights were violated. The District Court held that Appellants\u2019 claim must fail as a matter of law because they failed to present sufficient evidence to support a finding that Travonne had been taken into \u201cprotective custody\u201d within the meaning of 23 Pa. Cons.Stat. Ann. \u00a7 6315, or, assuming that he was in \u201cprotective custody,\u201d that Daniels had acted unreasonably in not initiating a hearing within 72 hours.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-12\">In entering judgment as a matter of law, the District Court focused on the procedures required under state statute when a child is taken into protective custody. We agree with the District Court that Appellants did not set forth sufficient evidence at trial to support a finding that Travonne was taken into \u201cprotective custody\u201d within the meaning of 23 Pa. Cons. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 6315. However, an inquiry into whether Appellants were afforded all of the process they were due cannot end there. It is well settled that state law does not define the parameters of due process for the purposes of the Fourteenth Amendment. <em>See Cleveland Bd. of Educ. v. Loudermill, </em>470 U.S. 532, 541, 105 S.Ct. 1487, 84 L.Ed.2d 494 (1985) (\u201c[Ojnce it is determined that the Due Process Clause applies, the question remains what process is due. The answer to that question is not to be found in the [state] statute.\u201d) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted); <em>Swipies v. Kofka, </em>419 F.3d 709, 716 (8th Cir.2005) (holding that \u201ca state statute cannot dictate what procedural protections must attend a liberty interest ... as this is the sole province of federal law\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b493-13\">Whether or not under the facts of this case, compliance with the procedures set <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>out in the CPSL conforms with the requirements of federal due process is an issue we need not decide here because we can affirm on other grounds. <em>See Nicini v. Morra, </em>212 F.3d 798, 805 (3d Cir.2000) (en bane) (concluding that we may affirm the District Court on any grounds supported by the record). \u201cThe fundamental requirement of due process is the opportunity to be heard \u2018at a meaningful time and in a meaningful manner.\u2019 \u201d <em>Mathews v. Eldridge, </em>424 U.S. 319, 333, 96 S.Ct. 893, 47 L.Ed.2d 18 (1976). Whether Appellants\u2019 procedural due process rights were violated by Appellee\u2019s failure to schedule a hearing regarding the placement of their son with sufficient promptness can be determined by a balancing of three factors:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Axe\">First, the private interest that will be affected by the official action; second, the risk of an erroneous deprivation of such interest through the procedures used, and the probable value, if any, of additional or substitute procedural safeguards; and finally, the Government\u2019s interest, including the function involved and the fiscal and administrative burdens that the additional or substitute procedural requirement would entail.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b494-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 334-35, 96 S.Ct. 893; <em>see also Miller v. City of Philadelphia, </em>174 F.3d 368. The private interest here is the right to family integrity, which this Court has indicated must be balanced against the state\u2019s interest in protecting children suspected of being abused. <em>See Miller, </em>174 F.3d at 373; <em>Croft v. Westmoreland County Children &amp; Youth Serv., </em>103 F.3d 1123, 1125 (3d Cir. 1997). As explained in <em>Patterson v. Armstrong, </em>141 F.Supp.2d 512 (W.D.Pa.2001):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-5\">... While not <em>dispositive, </em>the statutory schemes adopted by the Pennsylvania legislature in the familial integrity arena are highly <em>relevant </em>to this Court\u2019s consideration of the second and third factors ....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-6\">The \u201cadditional or substitute procedural safeguards\u201d that the defendants should have followed in this case were those carefully crafted and interlocking procedures of the CPSL and the Juvenile Act. The \u201cprobable value\u201d of following the legislatively mandated procedures, providing for quick judicial review, is in the greatly reduced risk of erroneous interference with parental rights and the integrity of the family unit. Similarly, the legislature obviously considered the fiscal and administrative burdens that would fall on child protective services agencies and local law enforcement officials charged by the CPSL, the Juvenile Act, the PFA Act with protecting the safety and welfare of children and with safeguarding the constitutional rights of parents and the family, and enacted related legislation <em>mandating </em>specific procedural requirements. The Pennsylvania General Assembly must be presumed to have intended those burdens be carried by the appropriate local officials.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b494-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 538.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-9\">It is well-settled that \u201cin emergency circumstances which pose an immediate threat to the safety of a child, officials may temporarily deprive a parent of custody without parental consent or a court order.\u201d <em>Hollingsworth v. Hill, </em>110 F.3d 733, 739 (10th Cir.1997). However, \u201cin those extraordinary situations where deprivation of a protected interest is permitted without pri- or process, the constitutional requirements of notice and an opportunity to be heard are not eliminated, but merely postponed.\u201d <em>Suboh v. District Attorney\u2019s Office of Suffolk, </em>298 F.3d 81, 92 (1st Cir.2002) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted). Thus, \u201c[w]hen the state removes a child from her parents, due process guarantees prompt and fair post-deprivation judicial review.\u201d <em>Berman v. Young, </em>291 F.3d 976, 985 (7th Cir.2002); <em>see also Miller v. City of Philadelphia, </em>174 F.3d 368,</p>\n<p id=\"b495-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>372 n. 4 (3d Cir.1999) (\u201cInitiating child custody proceedings by <em>ex parte </em>orders is generally constitutional if a prompt post-deprivation hearing is held.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b495-5\">There is no bright-line rule for deciding whether a post-deprivation hearing is sufficiently \u201cprompt\u201d. <em>See Tower v. Leslie-Brown, </em>326 F.3d 290, 299 (1st Cir.2003) (approving post-deprivation hearing three days after children\u2019s removal); <em>Berman, </em>291 F.3d at 985 (concluding that 72-day delay was \u201crather outrageous,\u201d but finding no actual damages); <em>Whisman v. Rine-hart, </em>119 F.3d 1303, 1310 (8th Cir.1997) (concluding that hearing held 17 days after the state had taken custody was not \u201cprompt\u201d); <em>Jordan v. Jackson, </em>15 F.3d 333, 351 (4th Cir.1994) (concluding that 65-hour delay in judicial review of emergency removal was \u201cnear, if not at, the outer limit of permissible delay\u201d); <em>Cecere v. City of New York, </em>967 F.2d 826, 829-30 (2d Cir.1992) (concluding that 4-day delay was constitutionally permissible); <em>Lossman v. Pekarske, </em>707 F.2d 288, 290 (7th Cir.1983) (approving 12-day delay, based on parents\u2019 request for additional time to prepare).</p>\n<p id=\"b495-6\">The evidence introduced at trial indicates that, on May 21, while Travonne may not have been in \u201cprotective custody,\u201d he was residing at his grandmother\u2019s house and Appellants were unable to regain physical custody of him due to the presence of the PFA order. It further reveals that the first dependency hearing was scheduled for June 25, at least four weeks after Travonne began residing with his grandmother. The hearing was then continued for two weeks at Appellants\u2019 request. On July 9, 2003, the Juvenile Court ordered that Travonne remain with his grandmother pending permission from his therapist to return home. According to Kevin Brown\u2019s testimony, Travonne did not return home until over six months after the hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-7\">Whether or not the hearing here satisfied due process \u201cpromptness,\u201d we will affirm the judgment of the District Court. In order to prevail on a \u00a7 1988 claim where a \u201cprompt\u201d post-deprivation hearing was not conducted after the removal of a child, a plaintiff must establish \u201cwith some degree of probability[ ] that a timely hearing would have prevented the extended infringement on their familial rights. In other words, [she] must demonstrate actual damages resulting from the delay in the post-deprivation hearing.\u201d <em>Berman v. Young, </em>291 F.3d 976, 985 (7th Cir.2002) (internal citation and quotation omitted); <em>see also Carey v. Piphus, </em>435 U.S. 247, 264, 98 S.Ct. 1042, 55 L.Ed.2d 252 (1978) (holding that, in order to obtain compensatory damages for mental and emotional distress caused by denial of procedural due process, plaintiff must adduce proof that the injury was caused by the deprivation of due process). Here, Appellants did receive a hearing on July 9, 2003, at which time the juvenile court judge ordered that Travonne remain with his grandmother. There is no indication in the record that had the hearing been conducted earlier, a different result would have been reached. Thus, because the state court approved the placement of Travonne with his grandmother on July 9, and in light of the testimony presented at trial, we conclude that Appellants have not demonstrated any compensable injury resulting from the delayed hearing. <em>See Berman, </em>291 F.3d at 985 (concluding that, \u201cespecially given that the state court approved the removal\u201d of the child from her home, the parents could not demonstrate any injury resulting from the delayed hearing); <em>see also Lossman, </em>707 F.2d at 291 (holding that, even if a hearing had been conducted earlier, the result presumably would have been the same, and therefore, causation did not exist). Accordingly, we will affirm the District Court\u2019s entry of judgment as a matter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>of law on Appellants\u2019 procedural due process claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-4\">Appellants\u2019 next two claims are that the District Court erred in granting Appellee\u2019s motion <em>in limine </em>to dismiss Kevin Brown from the action immediately prior to the start of the trial for lack of standing and in denying their motion <em>in limine </em>to bar Appellee from introducing at trial materials from her files from the abuse investigation. Under the CPSL, only a \u201cparent, guardian or other custodian\u201d is entitled to a hearing. <em>See </em>23 Pa. Cons.Stat. Ann. \u00a7 6315. Because Kevin Brown had no legal relationship with Travonne, the Court held that he would not have been entitled to a hearing and therefore lacked standing to assert a violation of his due process rights on this basis. While Appellee certainly placed the Browns at a disadvantage by raising this issue on the day of trial, it is clear that standing can never be waived. <em>See United States v. Hays, </em>515 U.S. 737, 742, 115 S.Ct. 2431, 132 L.Ed.2d 635 (1995). Accordingly, we will affirm the District Court\u2019s dismissal of Kevin Brown as a party to this action. We will also affirm the District Court\u2019s denial of Appellants\u2019 motion <em>in limine, </em>as it is clear that the materials Appellants sought to suppress were relevant and necessary to Appellee\u2019s defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-5\">Finally, Appellants contest the District Court\u2019s denial of their motion to join certain parties to the complaint. We review the District Court\u2019s denial of Appellants\u2019 motion to amend their complaint for abuse of discretion. <em>See Garvin v. City of Philadelphia, </em>354 F.3d 215, 219 (3d Cir. 2003). Appellants maintain that they attempted to file a motion for joinder of additional parties on July 11, 2005. In the motion, they sought to add, as plaintiffs, their minor children, and as defendants, Alfred Crump, a Solicitor for BCCYS, Wendie Ziegler, a Court-Appointed Guardian <em>ad litem, </em>and James Trupp, a BCCYS caseworker. The motion did not appear on the District Court\u2019s docket until February 21, 2006, six days before trial was originally scheduled to begin. The Court adjourned the trial date, gave Ap-pellee an opportunity to respond, and on May 11, 2006, denied the motion and rescheduled the trial for late May.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-7\">While the motion was captioned under Rule 19 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, the Court properly analyzed it under Rule 15, which governs the amendment of pleadings. Relying on Rule 15(c), the District Court held that the motion for leave to amend had been filed outside of the applicable statute of limitations, and that Appellants had not offered any evidence to show that the proposed defendants had received either actual or imputed notice of the action within 120 days of filing the complaint. <em>See Singletary v. Pennsylvania Dep\u2019t of Corn., </em>266 F.3d 186, 194 (3d Cir.2001). Accordingly, the Court held that Appellants could not satisfy the relation back requirements, and therefore, denied their motion to amend.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-8\">Appellants argue that they filed the motion on July 11, 2005, within the statute of limitations, but that it was not entered on the Court\u2019s docket until February 21, 2006. In light of this discrepancy, we will not affirm the District Court\u2019s decision on this basis. We will, however, affirm on other grounds. <em>See Nicini, </em>212 F.3d at 805. While Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 15(a) provides that leave to amend \u201cshall be freely given when justice so requires,\u201d it may be denied when amendment would be futile. Appellants claim that both Crump and Ziegler discriminated against them on the basis of race by objecting to the reunification of Appellants\u2019 family in the context of the dependency proceedings. Based on the record below, we conclude that Crump and Ziegler would have been entitled to absolute immunity for their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>roles in Appellants\u2019 dependency proceedings. <em>See Ernst v. Child &amp; Youth Servs. of Chester County, </em>108 F.3d 486, 495 (3d Cir.1997) (defendants entitled to \u201cabsolute immunity for their actions on behalf of the state in preparing for, initiating, and prosecuting dependency proceedings\u201d). In light of the proposed defendants\u2019 immunity, Appellants would have been unable to withstand a motion to dismiss, and therefore amendment would have been futile. <em>See Hill v. Scranton, </em>411 F.3d 118, 134 (3d Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b497-5\">We will also affirm the District Court\u2019s denial of Appellants\u2019 motion to amend the complaint to add caseworker James Trupp as a defendant.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>See Nicini, </em>212 F.3d at 805. Appellants allege that Trupp discriminated against them on the basis of race and violated their rights to due process and family integrity by contacting Dr. Thomas Baker, a psychologist who was appointed by the Juvenile Court to evaluate the family, and requesting a copy of his assessment without Appellants\u2019 consent, objecting to the reunification of the family at the dependency hearing, and seeking to remove Erica Brown\u2019s daughter from her custody. Appellants\u2019 allegations against Trupp do not demonstrate violations of them constitutional rights. The transcript from the July 9, 2003 Juvenile Court hearing clearly indicates that the court ordered that Dr. Baker\u2019s report be made available to the guardian and the agency. Trupp\u2019s objection to the reunification of the family and his participation in dependency proceedings likewise do not amount to violations of Appellants\u2019 constitutional rights. <em>See Miller v. Philadelphia, </em>174 F.3d 368, 377 (3d Cir.1999) (holding that, to constitute a substantive due process violation, a social worker\u2019s conduct must \u201cshock the conscience\u201d); <em>Croft v. Westmoreland County Children &amp; Youth Servs., </em>103 F.3d 1123, 1125 (3d Cir.1997) (\u201cThe right to familial integrity, in other words, does not include a right to remain free from child abuse allegations.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b497-10\">Finally, Appellants sought to add their minor children as plaintiffs in the action. As pointed out by Appellee, Appellants, as non-lawyers, would not be permitted to represent their children in an action in federal court. <em>See Osei-Afriyie v. Medical College of Pennsylvania, </em>937 F.2d 876, 884 (3d Cir.1991). As Appellants\u2019 proposed amendments would have been futile, we conclude that the District Court did not abuse its discretion in denying appellant\u2019s motion for leave to amend.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-11\">Accordingly, we will affirm the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b497-6\">. We note that Appellants initially sought to add Trupp as a defendant on October 13, 2003, two months after the initial complaint was filed. The District Court denied Appellants leave to amend without prejudice pending its ruling on Appellees' motion to dismiss.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
