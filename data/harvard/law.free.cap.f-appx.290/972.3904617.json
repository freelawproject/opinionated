Cysewski appeals the district court\u2019s order affirming the Social Security Administration\u2019s denial of her application for disability benefits. The Administrative Law Judge (\u201cALJ\u201d) determined that notwithstanding Cysewski\u2019s chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and obesity, she was able to perform past relevant work, and therefore was not disabled. Because the ALJ erred in discounting Cysewski\u2019s testimony concerning the effect of her symptoms, and did not make adequate findings concerning Cysewski\u2019s residual functional capacity (\u201cRFC\u201d), we reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b996-8\">The ALJ erred in discounting Cysewski\u2019s testimony regarding the severity of her symptoms. Once a \u201cclaimant has presented objective medical evidence of an underlying impairment which could reasonably be expected to produce the pain or other symptoms alleged ... the ALJ can reject the claimant\u2019s testimony about the severity of her symptoms only by offering specific, clear and convincing reasons for doing so.\u201d <em>Lingenfelter v. Astrue, </em>504 F.3d 1028, 1036 (9th Cir.2007) (internal citations and quotation marks omitted). The ALJ pointed to activities reported in a February 7, 2004, Daily Activities Questionnaire to discount Cysewski\u2019s testimony from the June 6, 2006, hearing, without giving her the opportunity to explain whether ensuing developments between the two dates precluded the AL J\u2019s reliance on the earlier-reported activities. This was especially problematic both because the ALJ did not mention a November 3, 2005, Disability Report\u2014Appeal form in which Cysewski claimed new physical limitations resulting from her bronchitis and because Cysewski was unrepresented at the hearing. <em>See Tonapetyan v. Halter, </em>242 F.3d 1144, 1150 (9th Cir.2001) (noting that \u201cthe ALJ must be especially diligent in exploring for all the relevant facts\u201d when a petitioner appears <em>pro </em>se). Further, the ALJ improperly discounted Cy-sewski\u2019s testimony as not credible based on the fact that she was paid to provide fifty hours of childcare per week for her two grandchildren. Babysitting one\u2019s own grandchildren at home does not always mean that one will be able to perform the functions of a childcare provider in the workplace; the fact that Cysewski cared for the grandchildren does not necessarily undermine her testimony of the limiting impact of her symptoms. On remand the ALJ must credit Cysewski\u2019s testimony regarding the severity of her symptoms, and reexamine the testimony of Cysewski\u2019s friend Wiley Peterson, in light of the foregoing discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b996-11\">The ALJ\u2019s findings regarding Cysewski\u2019s RFC were not supported by sub<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"975\">*975</page-number>stantial evidence and violated Social Security Ruling (\u201cSSR\u201d) 96-8p. The ALJ erred in relying almost exclusively on the State Agency\u2019s Physical Residual Functional Capacity Assessment (\u201cPRFCA\u201d) in determining Cysewski\u2019s RFC. Cysew-ski\u2019s PRFCA does not contain explanatory statements as required by the form\u2019s instructions. <em>See Celaya v. Halter, </em>332 F.3d 1177, 1184 (9th Cir.2003) (holding that an ALJ committed error by relying on a PRFCA that was deficient because it lacked \u201ccomment, rationale, or evident attention to the medical record\u201d). Therefore, it cannot serve as substantial evidence to support the ALJ\u2019s RFC determination. <em>See id. </em>Moreover, the ALJ erred by failing to make detailed findings regarding the \u201cnature and extent of [Cy-sewski\u2019s] physical limitations and then de-termin[ing] [her] residual functional capacity for work activity on a regular and continuing basis.\u201d 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1545(b); <em>see also </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.945(b); SSR 96-8p (enumerating the various exertional and nonexertional capacities and setting forth narrative discussion requirements for the ALJ). On remand, the ALJ must perform a function-by-function assessment of Cysewski\u2019s exertional and nonexertional capacities prior to expressing her RFC in terms of exertional categories such as \u201csedentary,\u201d \u201clight,\u201d or \u201cmedium\u201d work.</p>\n<p id=\"b997-5\">Because we conclude that ALJ\u2019s RFC finding is insufficient, we do not reach Cysewski\u2019s contention that the ALJ erred in failing to make findings about the specific requirements of her past relevant work. We note, however, that the determination as to whether a claimant retains the capacity to perform her past work depends on \u201c[a] finding of fact as to the physical and mental demands of the past job/occupation.\u201d SSR 82-62; <em>see also </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.1520(e), 416.920(e). We reverse and remand to the district court so that it can further remand to the agency with instructions to credit Cysewski\u2019s testimony about the severity of her symptoms and develop the record with respect to Cysewski\u2019s RFC.</p>\n<p id=\"b997-7\">REVERSED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b996-9\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
