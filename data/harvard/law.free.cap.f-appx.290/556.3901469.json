York pled guilty to conspiracy to distribute fifty grams or more of crack cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846 (2000). He was sentenced to 122 months of imprisonment and a five-year term of supervised release. On appeal, counsel has filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), stating that, in his opinion, there are no meritorious grounds for appeal, but raising the issue of whether the district court complied with the requirements of Fed.R.Crim.P. 11 in accepting York\u2019s guilty plea. Although advised of his right to file a pro se brief, York has not done so. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-11\">York did not move in the district court to withdraw his guilty plea, therefore his challenge to the adequacy of the Rule 11 hearing is reviewed for plain error. <em>See United States v. Martinez, </em>277 F.3d 517, 525 (4th Cir.2002). We have carefully reviewed the transcript of the Rule 11 hearing and find no plain error in the district court\u2019s acceptance of York\u2019s guilty plea. <em>See United States v. DeFusco, </em>949 F.2d 114, 119-20 (4th Cir.1991). Moreover, York is bound by the statements he made at the Rule 11 hearing, <em>see Blackledge v. Allison, </em>431 U.S. 63, 74, 97 S.Ct. 1621, 52 L.Ed.2d 136 (1977), and we find no evidence that York\u2019s plea was not knowing or voluntary. <em>See United States v. Marin, </em>961 F.2d 493, 496 (4th Cir.1992); <em>United States v. Wessells, </em>936 F.2d 165, 167-68 (4th Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b579-13\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the entire record in this case and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. We therefore affirm York\u2019s conviction and sentence. This court requires that counsel inform York, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If York requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on York. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-14\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
