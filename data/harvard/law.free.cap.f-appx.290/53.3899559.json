Haulot appeals the district court\u2019s judgment affirming the Social Security Administration\u2019s denial of his application for disability insurance benefits under Title II of the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 401-33.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we reverse and remand for a calculation of benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-8\">1. Treating physician opinion</p>\n<p id=\"b76-9\">Haulot contends that the ALJ erred by rejecting the medical opinion of his treating physician, Dr. Wallace, while accepting the testimony of a non-treating, non-examining physician, Dr. Goren, because the ALJ failed to \u201cprovid[e] \u2018specific and legitimate reasons\u2019 supported by substantial evidence in the record.\u201d <em>Rollins v. Massanari, </em>261 F.3d 853, 856 (9th Cir. 2001). We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-10\">First, the ALJ rejected Dr. Wallace\u2019s opinion because Wallace\u2019s findings were \u201cnot supported by his own examinations of the claimant.\u201d In support of his finding, the ALJ relied on an October 2000 exam, more than one year before Haulot\u2019s alleged onset date of disability. We have said, however, that \u201c[wjhere a claimant\u2019s condition becomes progressively worse, medical reports from an early phase of the disease are likely to be less probative than later reports.\u201d <em>Magallanes v. Bowen, </em>881 F.2d 747, 755 (9th Cir.1989). Here, as the record shows, Dr. Wallace\u2019s notes from later examinations of Haulot \u2014 after the alleged onset date \u2014 support his opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-14\">Second, the ALJ discounted Dr. Wallace\u2019s opinion because it was not supported by objective medical evidence. This reason is not supported by substantial evidence. To the contrary, a complete review of the record shows that the objective medical evidence, including x-rays and other diagnostic tests as well as the diagnoses of other physicians, was entirely consistent with Dr. Wallace\u2019s opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-15\">Finally, the ALJ rejected Dr. Wallace\u2019s findings because it \u201cappeared] that Dr. Wallace was sympathetic to the claimant.\u201d The ALJ, however, never pointed to any evidence that Dr. Wallace was so sympathetic to Haulot as to impair his sound professional opinion, or was acting as Hau-lot\u2019s agent to aid him in collecting disability benefits. The ALJ\u2019s statement that Dr. Wallace was \u201csympathetic\u201d to Haulot therefore does not constitute substantial evidence for rejecting the treating doctor\u2019s considered diagnosis. <em>See Embrey v. Bowen, </em>849 F.2d 418, 421-22 (9th Cir.1988) (\u201cThe ALJ must do more than offer his conclusions.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b76-16\">2. Subjective symptom testimony</p>\n<p id=\"b76-17\">Haulot also argues that the ALJ erred by finding his testimony not credible without \u201coffering specific, clear and convincing reasons for doing so.\u201d <em>Smolen v. Chater, </em>80 F.3d 1273, 1281 (9th Cir.1996). We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>First, the ALJ erred in finding material inconsistencies in Haulot\u2019s testimony where there were none. Any minor discrepancies in Haulot\u2019s testimony were not enough to establish clear and convincing evidence that he is incredible. <em>See Robbins v. Soc. Sec. Admin., </em>466 F.3d 880, 884 (9th Cir.2006). Indeed, many of the minor inconsistencies cited concerned issues which the ALJ acknowledged were collateral in nature (e.g., alcohol use).</p>\n<p id=\"b77-5\">Second, as noted above, abundant clinical evidence supported Haulot\u2019s allegations of pain. The ALJ erred by \u201cselectively focus[ing] on ... [evidence] which tend[ed] to suggest non-disability.\u201d <em>Edlund v. Massanari, </em>253 F.3d 1152, 1159 (9th Cir. 2001). The ALJ also erred in rejecting Haulot\u2019s claims of debilitating pain based on a lack of \u201cneurological deficits.\u201d As noted by Dr. Barranco, Haulot\u2019s treating neurologist, a lack of neurological deficits was not surprising because Haulot\u2019s back disorder was <em>mechanical </em>rather than neurological in nature.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-6\">Finally, the ALJ grossly overstated the evidence that Haulot performed activities inconsistent with his stated level of pain. The fact that Haulot drove short distances every four or five weeks, occasionally fixed himself a sandwich, washed dishes, did laundry, went on brief grocery shopping trips every couple of weeks, and once attempted to dig a hole but gave up because of pain, does not support the conclusion that he can work eight hours a day, five days a week, on a consistent basis. <em>See, e.g., Vertigan v. Halter, </em>260 F.3d 1044, 1050 (9th Cir.2001) (\u201c[T]he mere fact that a plaintiff has carried on certain daily activities, such as grocery shopping, driving a car, or limited walking for exercise, does not in any way detract from her credibility as to her overall disability. One does not need to be \u2018utterly incapacitated\u2019 in order to be disabled.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b77-7\">3. Remand for calculation of benefits</p>\n<p id=\"b77-8\">\u201cWhen an ALJ\u2019s reasons for rejecting the claimant\u2019s testimony are legally insufficient and it is clear from the record that the ALJ would be required to determine the claimant disabled if he had credited the claimant\u2019s testimony, we remand for a calculation of benefits.\u201d <em>Orn v. </em>As<em>true, </em>495 F.3d 625, 640 (9th Cir.2007) (internal quotation marks omitted); <em>see also Hammock v. Bowen, </em>879 F.2d 498, 502 (9th Cir.1989) (crediting opinion of treating physician \u201cas a matter of law\u201d where ALJ failed to provide sufficient reasons for rejecting that opinion). The vocational expert in this case testified that an individual with the limitations described by Dr. Wallace and Haulot would not possess the residual functional capacity to perform Haulot\u2019s past relevant work or other work available in significant numbers in the national economy. Therefore, when Dr. Wallace\u2019s opinion and Haulot\u2019s testimony are appropriately credited, it is clear that the record requires a finding of disability. Because there are no further issues for the agency to resolve, Haulot is entitled to an award of benefits. <em>See Orn, </em>495 F.3d at 640.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-9\">REVERSED and REMANDED with instructions to remand to the Commissioner for calculation of benefits.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b76-11\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
