The District Court sentenced him to 180 months\u2019 imprisonment, and he now appeals. For the reasons that follow, we will affirm the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-22\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-23\">On March 6, 2006, a confidential informant provided a tip to a Harrisburg police officer that a man and woman were selling firearms at the Riviera Bar in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. The informant told the officer that the man and woman possessed six guns, which were wrapped in blankets and stored in a metal shopping cart. When the police responded to the area, they found Robert Allen Boswell and Helene Mitchell, who matched the description given by the informant and had a cart containing two rifles and two shotguns.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-24\">On October 18, 2006, a grand jury indicted Boswell on one count of possession of a firearm by a convicted felon in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 922(g) and 924(e). Boswell pleaded guilty to that charge on December 27, 2006, and the District Court subsequently conducted a sentencing hearing. Utilizing the applicable United States Sentencing Guidelines (\u201cGuidelines\u201d), the District Court found that Bos-</p>\n<p id=\"b505-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>well had a Guidelines range of 180 to 210 months\u2019 imprisonment. Additionally, it found that Boswell was subject to a mandatory minimum sentence of fifteen years\u2019 imprisonment pursuant to the Armed Career Criminal Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e). Boswell challenged the application of \u00a7 924(e), arguing that it constituted cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the Eighth Amendment, but the District Court rejected this argument. It sentenced Boswell to 180 months\u2019 imprisonment (fifteen years), a three-year term of supervised release, and a fine of $1,000. Boswell\u2019s timely appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-6\">We exercise jurisdiction over this appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(a)(1). Our review is plenary where, as here, the appeal raises a legal issue of constitutional interpretation. <em>United States v. Coleman, </em>451 F.3d 154, 156 (3d Cir.2006) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b505-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-8\">Boswell argues that his sentence of fifteen years\u2019 imprisonment violates the Eighth Amendment protection against cruel and unusual punishment because the sentence is disproportionate to the crime he committed. The Eighth Amendment prohibits \u201ccruel and unusual punishments,\u201d and it includes a \u201cnarrow proportionality principle\u201d that \u201capplies to noncapital sentences.\u201d <em>Ewing v. California, </em>538 U.S. 11, 22, 123 S.Ct. 1179, 155 L.Ed.2d 108 (2003) (plurality opinion). For these proportionality challenges, we examine three factors: \u201c(1) the gravity of the offense and the harshness of the penalty; (2) the sentences imposed on other criminals in the same jurisdiction; and (3) the sentences imposed for commission of the same crime in other jurisdictions.\u201d <em>United States v. MacEwan, </em>445 F.3d 237, 247 (3d Cir.2006) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). In doing so, we give Congress \u201csubstantial deference,\u201d and thus, if the defendant fails to demonstrate that there is a gross imbalance between the gravity of his offense and his sentence under the first factor, \u201cour analysis is at an end.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 247-48.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-11\">Applying the first factor to \u00a7 924(e), we cannot conclude that there is a gross imbalance between the gravity of the offense and the fifteen-year mandatory minimum sentence. Under section 924(e), the fifteen-year mandatory minimum sentence applies to those \u201cwho violate[d] [18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g) ] and ha[ve] three previous convictions by any court referred to in [18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1) ] for a violent felony or a serious drug offense, or both, committed on occasions different from one another.\u201d The crime a defendant has committed under this section is serious as demonstrated in the present case: Boswell violated federal firearm laws by possessing a firearm, and he has an extensive criminal record, which includes several felony drug convictions. This conduct is no less grave than the conduct that defendants committed in similar cases. <em>See Ewing, </em>538 U.S. at 28, 123 S.Ct. 1179 (noting the seriousness of the defendant\u2019s crime, which was committing \u201cfelony grand theft ... after previously having been convicted of at least two \u2018violent\u2019 or \u2018serious\u2019 felonies\u201d); <em>MacEwan, </em>445 F.3d at 249 (noting the seriousness of the defendant\u2019s crimes, which included twice violating federal anti-child pornography laws). The Supreme Court and this Court rejected those challenges just as we now reject Boswell\u2019s challenge to the Armed Career Criminal Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-12\">We cannot conclude that a sentence of fifteen years\u2019 imprisonment is grossly disproportionate to the seriousness of the offense under \u00a7 924(e).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>See Ewing, </em>538 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>U.S. at 30, 123 S.Ct. 1179 (holding that the defendant\u2019s sentence of twenty-five years to life imprisonment was not grossly disproportionate to his offense); <em>MacEwan, </em>445 F.3d at 250 (holding that the defendant\u2019s mandatory minimum term of fifteen years\u2019 imprisonment was not grossly disproportionate to his offense). Thus, as there is no gross imbalance between Boswell\u2019s crime and his sentence, \u201cour analysis is at an end,\u201d <em>MacEwan, </em>445 F.3d at 248, and we will not consider the remaining two factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-4\">Therefore, we hold that the fifteen-year mandatory minimum sentence imposed under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e) is not a cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the Eighth Amendment. We note that our decision is in accord with several other Courts of Appeals. <em>See United States v. Collins, </em>321 F.3d 691, 698-99 (8th Cir. 2003); <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>22 F.3d 674, 683 (6th Cir.1994); <em>United States v. Mitchell, </em>932 F.2d 1027, 1028-29 (2d Cir. 1991); <em>United States v. Sanchez, </em>859 F.2d 483, 486 (7th Cir.1988); <em>United States v. Gilliard, </em>847 F.2d 21, 27 (1st Cir.1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b506-5\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-6\">Based on the foregoing, we will affirm the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b505-9\">. To the extent that Boswell argues that his sentence is effectively a life sentence due to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>his health and age, and thus is disproportionate, we find this argument to be unavailing. <em>See MacEwan, </em>445 F.3d at 249 &amp; n. 11 (rejecting the argument that \"a de facto life sentence created by a statutory mandatory minimum term of years is a violation of the Eighth Amendment\u201d)</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
