Under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(l)(A)(i), Cortez was subject to a statutory mandatory minimum sentence of 120 months\u2019 imprisonment. Cortez requested that the district find him eligible for \u201csafety-valve\u201d relief pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(f), which allows district courts to depart below the mandatory minimum if, among other things, the defendant \u201chas truthfully provided to the Government all information and evidence the defendant has concerning the offense or offenses that were part of the same course of conduct or of a common scheme or plan.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(f)(5). At sentencing, the district court denied Cortez safety-valve relief after expressly adopting the presentence report. The district court then sentenced Cortez to a term of 120 months\u2019 incarceration.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-9\">Cortez now appeals his sentence, arguing that the district court did not adequately explain its reasons for denying him safety-valve relief. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(c) requires the district court to \u201cstate in open court the reasons for its imposition of the particular sentence\u201d it imposes. We have stated that district courts may satisfy this requirement by adopting the PSR in open court, which \u201cputs the defendant on notice of the grounds for the sentence imposed since the defendant usually has either seen his own PSR or is entitled to ask for it.\u201d <em>United States v. Molina, </em>356 F.3d 269, 277 (2d Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b432-11\">Here, the district court expressly adopted the PSR in open court. The PSR included the factual finding that Cortez \u201cdid not truthfully provide all information and evidence concerning [his] offense to the Government.\u201d Thus, the district court did not violate \u00a7 3553(c), and we are satisfied that the district court \u201cconsidered the parties arguments and ha[d] a reasoned basis for exercising [its] legal decisionmak-ing authority.\u201d <em>Rita v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2468, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b432-14\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
