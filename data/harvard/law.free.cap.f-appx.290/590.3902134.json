Backoulas challenges the Board\u2019s order adopting and affirming the immigration judge\u2019s denial of a waiver of inadmissibility under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1159(c) (2006), and her ruling that Backoulas\u2019 prior conviction was for a particularly serious crime under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3)(B) (2006), rendering him ineligible for withholding from removal. Backoulas argues the immigration judge used evidence beyond the record supporting his attempted burglary conviction to make the determinations that he was dangerous and his conviction was particularly serious. Finding no legal error, we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-23\">Under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii) (2006), this court lacks jurisdiction to re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>view any discretionary decision denying relief, such as the denial of a waiver of inadmissibility or the determination that a conviction is for a particularly serious crime. This court does have jurisdiction, however, to review constitutional claims and questions of law. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D) (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b613-5\">We have reviewed the issues Backoulas raises with respect to the standards employed by the immigration judge in determining Backoulas was dangerous based on his attempted burglary conviction. We see no error of law, as the correct standard was used. Insofar as the immigration judge found Backoulas\u2019 crime was dangerous, we lack jurisdiction to review that discretionary decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-6\">Likewise, we find no error with respect to the standard the immigration judge used to find Backoulas\u2019 attempted burglary was a particularly serious crime. We lack jurisdiction to review the immigration judge\u2019s ultimate, discretionary conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-7\">Accordingly, we deny the petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-8\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
