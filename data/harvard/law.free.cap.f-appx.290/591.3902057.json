Biggs entered a conditional guilty plea, pursuant to a plea agreement, to one count of assaulting a federal employee with a dangerous weapon, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 111(a), (b) (2000). Biggs agreed to plead guilty after the district court granted the Government\u2019s motion in limine that sought to preclude <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>Biggs from asserting at trial the defenses of necessity, justification, or self-defense. At sentencing, the district court denied Biggs\u2019 request for a downward departure and sentenced him to eighty months of imprisonment, three years of supervised release, and a $100 special assessment. Biggs timely appealed. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-4\">On appeal, Biggs argues that the district court erred in granting the Government\u2019s motion in limine because the facts supported the affirmative defenses of necessity, justification, or self-defense. A trial court\u2019s refusal to allow an affirmative defense raises a question of law, reviewable de novo. <em>See United States v. Perrin, </em>45 F.3d 869, 871 (4th Cir.1995). This court has also held that if \u201can affirmative defense consists of several elements and testimony supporting one element is insufficient to sustain it even if believed, the trial court and jury need not be burdened with testimony supporting other elements of the defense.\u201d <em>United States v. Sarno, </em>24 F.3d 618, 621 (4th Cir.1994). Our review of the record convinces us that the district court correctly concluded that the evidence was insufficient to allow Biggs to assert the requested defenses at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-5\">Accordingly, we affirm Biggs\u2019 conviction and sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
