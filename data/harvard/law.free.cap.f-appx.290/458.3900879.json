We will affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-23\">In 1998, a jury found Johnson guilty of assaulting and interfering with federal marshals in the performance of their official duties in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 111, distributing crack cocaine in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841, using or carrying a firearm in relation to a drug-trafficking crime or a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>crime of violence in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(1), and making a false statement to federal marshals in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001. The evidence at trial established that Johnson fired ten rounds from a nine-millimeter hand gun at seven federal marshals, and that he was engaged in a drug transaction just before the shooting. The District Court imposed a prison sentence of 272 months, including a sentence of 60 months on the \u00a7 924(c) offense which would run consecutive to the sentence imposed on the drug-trafficking offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-5\">The District Court\u2019s sentence calculation included an upward departure of two levels under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K2.6 due to the seriousness of Johnson\u2019s conduct and the fact that he intentionally shot at seven individuals.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> At the sentencing hearing, the District Court cited <em>United States v. Nakagawa, </em>924 F.2d 800 (9th Cir.1991), as authority for the upward departure. In <em>Nakagawa, </em>the defendant was charged with a drug offense and possession of a firearm during and in relation to a drug trafficking crime in violation of \u00a7 924(c). The court found an upward departure under \u00a7 5K2.6 warranted because 17 additional firearms were seized from the defendant\u2019s home, and his possession of weapons exceeded what was ordinarily involved in a drug trafficking conviction. <em>Id. </em>at 804-05.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-6\">In 1999, we affirmed Johnson\u2019s conviction and sentence on direct appeal. We held, among other things, that the District Court did not abuse its discretion in granting the two-level upward departure. In 2001, Johnson unsuccessfully moved to vacate his sentence pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. In 2007, Johnson filed a motion to reduce his sentence under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2), arguing that Amendment 599 to the Sentencing Guidelines lowered his sentencing range. The District Court denied Johnson\u2019s motion, and this appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-10\">Section 3582(c)(2) authorizes a district court to reduce a term of imprisonment in the case of a defendant who has been sentenced based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). Amendment 599 expanded the commentary to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.4 on use of a firearm during or in relation to certain crimes, and clarified under what circumstances defendants sentenced for violations of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c) in conjunction with convictions for other offenses may receive weapon enhancements contained in the Guidelines for those other offenses. <em>See </em>U.S. Sentencing Comm\u2019n Guidelines Manual, Supp. to App. C, at 71 (2000). Amendment 599 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-11\">If a sentence under this guideline is imposed in conjunction with a sentence for an underlying offense, do not apply any specific offense characteristic for possession, brandishing, use, or discharge of an explosive or firearm when determining the sentence for the underlying offense. A sentence under this guideline accounts for any explosive or weapon enhancement for the underlying offense of conviction....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b481-12\">U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.4, Application Note 4. Amendment 599 went into effect on November 1, 2000, and was made retroactive pursuant to \u00a7 1B1.10.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-13\">Johnson argues that Amendment 599 prohibits the District Court\u2019s two-level up<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>ward departure. The District Court, however, correctly explained that it did not use Johnson\u2019s discharge of the gun to increase the offense level for the underlying offense, but that it used his offense conduct to make an upward departure in the guideline range under \u00a7 5K2.6, an independent basis for doing so. In other words, the District Court did not apply a weapon \u201cenhancement,\u201d which is an adjustment to the base offense level as specifically provided by the Guidelines, but an \u201cupward departure,\u201d which is a discretionary adjustment to the Guidelines range once calculated. <em>See United States v. Shedrick, </em>493 F.3d 292, 298 n. 5 (3d Cir.2007) (defining \u201cenhancement\u201d and \u201cupward departure\u201d). Amendment 599 precludes a weapon enhancement for the underlying offense of conviction where a defendant has been sentenced for a \u00a7 924(c) violation, not an upward departure.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-4\">Accordingly, we shall affirm the order of the District Court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b481-7\">. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K2.6 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-8\">If a weapon or dangerous instrumentality was used or possessed in the commission of the offense the court may increase the sentence above the authorized guideline range. The extent of the increase ordinarily should depend on the dangerousness of the weapon, the manner in which it was used, and the extent to which its use endangered others. The discharge of a firearm might warrant a substantial sentence increase.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
