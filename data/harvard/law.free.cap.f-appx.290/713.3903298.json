Rodriguez-Cepeda\u2019s sole argument on appeal is that the record is insufficient to establish his guilt beyond a reasonable doubt because the record does not contain the stipulated facts introduced at his bench trial. This court reviews the entire record to determine whether the district court\u2019s finding of guilt is supported by \u201cany substantial evidence.\u201d <em>United States v. Serna-Villarreal, </em>352 F.3d 225, 234 (5th Cir. 2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b735-21\">After Rodriguez-Cepeda filed his appellate brief, this court granted the Government\u2019s motion to supplement the record with a copy of the stipulated facts, as well as an affidavit from the prosecutor attesting that the submitted copy is identical to the written stipulation introduced at Rodriguez-Cepeda\u2019s bench trial. Rodriguez-Cepeda has not responded to the Government\u2019s motion. Based on the record as supplemented, the evidence was sufficient to support the district court\u2019s finding of guilt.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-22\">The district court\u2019s judgment of conviction is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b735-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
