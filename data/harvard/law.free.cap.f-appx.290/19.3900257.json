[t]he murder was committed while the defendant was engaged in, or was an accomplice in, the commission of, attempted commission of, or the immediate flight after committing, or attempting to commit ... [job-bery ...\u201d The jury instruction substituted \u201ca defendant\u201d for \u201cthe defendant.\u201d Considering the allegedly deficient instruction in the context of all the other instructions and the trial court record \u2014 as it must, <em>see Boyde v. California, </em>494 U.S. 370, 378, 110 S.Ct. 1190, 108 L.Ed.2d 316 (1990) \u2014 the state court justifiably concluded that the jurors \u201cnecessarily [found] that [Blanco] was engaged in robbery at the time that Juan was killed.\u201d Thus, there was not a reasonable likelihood that the jury applied the instruction in a manner that violated the Constitution. <em>See Middleton v. McNeil, </em>541 U.S. 433, 437, 124 S.Ct. 1830, 158 L.Ed.2d 701 (2004). Therefore, the state court\u2019s decision was not contrary to or an unreasonable application of federal law as determined by the Supreme Court. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b42-9\">We decline to address the uncertified issues in this case because Blanco has failed to \u201cmake a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d <em>Doe v. Woodford, </em>508 F.3d 563, 567 (9th Cir. 2007) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b42-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b42-7\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
