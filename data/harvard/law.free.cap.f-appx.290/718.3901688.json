Urbina-Perez argues that the district court erred in imposing a 16-level enhancement pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii) based on his prior conviction for a crime of violence, a 1995 Arizona conviction for aggravated assault on a peace officer. He contends that the statute of conviction, Ariz.Rev.Stat. Ann. \u00a7 13-1204(A)(5) and (C), encompasses conduct amounting to simple assault, with the sole aggravating factor being the status of the victim as a peace officer. He contends that the offense does not qualify as an enumerated offense under the Guidelines because the offense falls outside of the generic, contemporary meaning of aggravated assault.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-9\">The Government concedes that in the light of <em>United States v. Fierro-Reyna, </em>466 F.3d 324 (5th Cir.2006), the district court plainly erred in applying a 16-level enhancement pursuant to \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii) based on Urbina-Per-ez\u2019s Arizona conviction for aggravated assault on a peace officer. Accordingly, we vacate Urbina-Perez\u2019s sentence and remand for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-12\">SENTENCE VACATED; CASE REMANDED FOR RESENTENCING.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b741-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
