At sentencing, the district court found that Moore possessed the firearm in connection with another felony offense. Accordingly, the court applied a 4-level specific offense characteristic under USSG \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(6), and imposed a statutory maximum sentence of 120 months\u2019 imprisonment, which within the advisory guideline range. Moore appealed, arguing that his Sixth Amendment right to a jury trial was violated when the district court\u2019s found, by a preponderance of evidence, certain facts supporting the specific offense characteristic, especially because this court may now apply an appellate presumption of reasonableness to a sentence within the advisory guideline range.</p>\n<p id=\"b992-21\">We review the issues raised by Moore for plain error, as he did not raise them in the district court. <em>See United States v. Pirani, </em>406 F.3d 543, 549 (8th Cir.2005) (en banc). We conclude that the district court did not err in deciding the facts relevant to sentencing or in applying a preponderance-of-the-evidence standard. <em>See Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 490, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000) (other than prior conviction, any fact that increases penalty for crime beyond statutory maximum must be submitted to jury and proved beyond reasonable doubt); <em>United States v. Garcia-Gonon, </em>433 F.3d 587, 593 (8th Cir.2006) (under advisory Guidelines regime, sentencing judges are only required to find sentence-enhancing facts by preponderance of evidence). Furthermore, Moore\u2019s apparent challenge to the appellate presumption of reasonableness for sentences within the advisory range is foreclosed by <em>Rita v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2462-68, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b992-24\">Accordingly, we affirm. See 8th Cir. R. 47B.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b992-18\">. The Honorable Carol E. Jackson, Chief Judge, United States District Court for the Eastern District of Missouri.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
