On appeal, Parzyck argues that the district court erred by dismissing his \u00a7 1983 claim because he established that each defendant demonstrated deliberate indifference to a serious medical condition, from which they knew Parzyck suffered. Specifically, Parzyck asserts that the following allegations state claims upon which relief can be granted: (1) Dr. M. Suarez\u2019s delay in providing care while Parzyck was in obvious need of medical attention; (2) Dr. Juan Nunez\u2019s failure to complete properly a consultation form ordering a neurological consultation; (3) Dr. D. Cherry\u2019s denial of Parzyck\u2019s request for a consultation; and (4) Prison Health Services, Inc.\u2019s (\u201cPHS\u201d) denial of adequate medical services through its policies and the customs of the employees it hired.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-5\">The district court <em>sua sponte </em>dismissed Parzyck\u2019s complaint for failure to state a claim. Civil cases filed by prisoners requesting leave to proceed are governed by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915, which provides that \u201cthe court shall dismiss the case at any time if the court determines that ... (B) the action or appeal ... (ii) fails to state a claim upon which relief may be granted.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2). We review a district court\u2019s <em>sua sponte </em>dismissal for failure to state a claim <em>de novo, </em>using the same standards that govern Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6) dismissals. <em>Farese v. Scherer, </em>342 F.3d 1223, 1230 (11th Cir.2003). In making the determination, <em>\u201c[p]ro se </em>pleadings are held to a less stringent standard than pleadings drafted by attorneys and will, therefore, be liberally construed.\u201d <em>Tannenbaum v. United States, </em>148 F.3d 1262, 1263 (11th Cir.1998) (28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 context).</p>\n<p id=\"b312-7\">As the Supreme Court has stated, \u201cdeliberate indifference to serious medical needs of prisoners constitutes the \u2018unnecessary and wanton infliction of pain,\u2019 proscribed by the Eighth Amendment.\u201d <em>Estelle v. Gamble, </em>429 U.S. 97, 104, 97 S.Ct. 285, 291, 50 L.Ed.2d 251 (1976) (quoting <em>Gregg v. Georgia, </em>428 U.S. 153, 182-83, 96 S.Ct. 2909, 49 L.Ed.2d 859 (1976)). However, \u201c[tjhe inadvertent or negligent failure to provide adequate medical care cannot be said to constitute an unnecessary and wanton infliction of pain.\u201d <em>Farrow v. West, </em>320 F.3d 1235, 1243 (11th Cir.2003) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b312-8\">A plaintiff attempting to prove an Eighth Amendment violation must demonstrate both that there was an objectively serious medical need and that prison personnel were deliberately indifferent to that need. <em>Id. </em>A serious medical need is \u201cone that has been diagnosed by a physician as mandating treatment or one that is so obvious that even a lay person would easily recognize the necessity for a doctor\u2019s attention.\u201d <em>Hill v. Dekalb Reg\u2019l Youth Det. Ctr., </em>40 F.3d 1176, 1187 (11th Cir.1994). In either situation, the need must be \u201cone that, if left unattended, poses a substantial risk of serious harm.\u201d <em>Taylor v. Adams, </em>221 F.3d 1254, 1258 (11th Cir.2000) (internal quotation marks omitted). Deliberate indifference has three elements: \u201c(1) subjective knowledge of a risk of serious harm; (2) disregard of that risk; (3) by conduct that is more than mere negligence.\u201d <em>McElligott v. Foley, </em>182 F.3d 1248, 1255 (11th Cir.1999). Deliberate indifference can occur where the prison official knows of the prisoner\u2019s medical need, but delays care unnecessarily or does not provide care at all. <em>Farrow, </em>320 F.3d at 1246. Deliberate indifference can also occur where the care given is so cursory as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>to amount to no treatment at all. <em>See Ancata v. Prison Health Servs., Inc., </em>769 F.2d 700, 704 (11th Cir.1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b313-5\">The district court did not err in dismissing Parzyck\u2019s claims against Dr. Nunez, Dr. Suarez, and Prison Health Services for failure to state a claim. With respect to PHS, Parzyck fails to make any specific factual allegations; he alleges only that their unwritten policies, practices, and protocols were deliberately indifferent without specifying in what manner the policies were deficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-6\">With respect to Dr. Nunez, Parzyck\u2019s second amended complaint alleges that Nunez violated Parzyck\u2019s Eighth Amendment rights by failing to indicate on a consultation form that Parzyck needed a neurological consultation. Nunez had concluded that Parzyck did need the consultation and told Parzyck as much. Parzyck does not allege that Nunez\u2019s failure to complete the form properly was motivated by ill-will or maliciousness. At most, Nunez\u2019s actions were negligent, which does not give rise to an Eighth Amendment violation. <em>Farrow, </em>320 F.3d at 1243. Therefore, the dismissal of the claim against Nunez was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-7\">Parzyck alleges that Suarez violated his Eighth Amendment rights because Parzyck was forced to wait ninety minutes, in extreme pain, before Suarez could examine him. There is no allegation that Suarez knew that Parzyck was in pain while he waited. Subjective knowledge of the prisoner\u2019s medical need is a requirement of a deliberate indifference cause of action. <em>McElligott, </em>182 F.3d at 1255. Therefore, the claim against Suarez was properly dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-8\">However, Parzyck\u2019s claim against Dr. Cherry should not have been dismissed. Parzyck\u2019s second amended complaint alleges that Cherry violated his Eighth Amendment rights by twice denying him a consultation with an orthopedic specialist, which had been recommended by another doctor. The district court found that the denials of a consultation were simply a disagreement about appropriate treatment between two doctors, and therefore not an actionable claim under the Eighth Amendment. However, after Cherry\u2019s first denial of a consultation, Par-zyck continued to experience severe pain. His condition prevented him from walking normally and caused him extreme pain on a daily basis; there can be no doubt that, taking Parzyck\u2019s allegations as true, his condition presented a serious medical need. Cherry was aware of Parzyck\u2019s condition and the inefficacy of the treatment afforded by the prison medical staff, but denied Parzyck\u2019s second request for an orthopedic consultation. Medical treatment that is so cursory as to provide no treatment at all gives rise to a claim of deliberate indifference. <em>See Ancata, </em>769 F.2d at 704. In this case, Cherry\u2019s repeated denial of an orthopedic consultation and the minimal treatment provided by the prison medical staff instead can be construed as so cursory as to afford Parzyck no treatment at all. Therefore, dismissal of Parzyck\u2019s claim against Cherry was in error.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-10\">Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal of Parzyck\u2019s \u00a7 1983 claim in part, and vacate and remand it in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-11\">AFFIRMED IN PART, VACATED AND REMANDED IN PART.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
