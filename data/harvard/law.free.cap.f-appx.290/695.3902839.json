In his written plea agreement, Si-fuentes waived his right to appeal his sentence \u201con any ground\u201d except on certain grounds not raised here. The Government seeks to enforce the waiver.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-18\">Sifuentes argues that the waiver is unenforceable because the Government breached his plea agreement by objecting to the presentence report and arguing for numerous sentencing enhancements. Because Sifuentes did not object in the district court to a breach of the plea agreement, this issue is reviewed for plain error only. <em>See United States v. Puckett, </em>505 F.3d 377, 384 (5th Cir.2007), <em>petition for cert, filed </em>(Mar. 3, 2008) (No. 07-9712). When analyzing a claim that a plea agreement has been breached, we consider \u201cwhether the government\u2019s conduct is consistent with the defendant\u2019s reasonable understanding of the agreement.\u201d <em>United States v. Lewis, </em>476 F.3d 369, 387-88 (5th Cir.) (quotation marks and citation omitted), ce<em>rt. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 2893, 167 L.Ed.2d 1164 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b717-24\">Although the parties agreed that certain guideline provisions \u201cshall be consulted and taken into account,\u201d the Government reserved its rights to present and dispute sentencing facts and factors. Sifuentes\u2019s interpretation of the plea agreement as precluding the Government from arguing that other guideline provisions should be applied is unreasonable. He has failed to establish a breach of the plea agreement that is plain, obvious, or affected his substantial rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-25\">Sifuentes does not argue that the appeal waiver was unknowing or involuntary, and under the plain language of the plea agreement, the waiver applies to the circumstances at hand. <em>See United States v. Bond, </em>414 F.3d 542, 544 (5th Cir.2005). Accordingly, Sifuentes\u2019s appeal waiver bars review of his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-26\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b717-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
