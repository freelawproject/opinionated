Fidel Lopez-Zamora appeals his sentence for illegal reentry following deportation. Lopez-Zamora contends that the 41-month term of imprisonment imposed in his case, based on the enhanced penalty provisions of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b), exceeds the statutory maximum sentence allowed for the \u00a7 1326(a) offense charged in his indictment. The Government moves for summary affirmance on the grounds that Lopez-Zamora\u2019s argument is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). As Lopez-Zamora concedes, the Government is correct. <em>See Almendarez-Torres, </em>523 U.S. at 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219; <em>United States v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 276 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b721-21\">Lopez-Zamora filed a motion for appointment of counsel in July 2006, after his counsel had moved to withdraw. The motion to withdraw was denied, and Lopez-Zamora has filed no pleading seeking removal of counsel. Therefore, his motion for appointment of counsel is DENIED as moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-22\">Because Lopez-Zamora\u2019s argument is foreclosed, the Government\u2019s motion for summary affirmance is GRANTED. The Government\u2019s alternative motion for an extension of time for filing an appellate brief is DENIED, and the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b721-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
