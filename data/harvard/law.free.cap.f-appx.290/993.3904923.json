James Wilkerson appeals the district court\u2019s denial of his habeas corpus petition, arguing that he received ineffective assistance of counsel where his trial counsel neither objected to an expansion of the indictment time period for jury instruction, nor presented new evidence regarding the expanded time period. We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s denial of habeas corpus. <em>Beardslee v. Woodford, </em>358 F.3d 560, 568 (9th Cir.2004). We cannot issue the writ unless the state court\u2019s decision is contrary to, or an objectively unreasonable application of clearly established Supreme Court precedent. <em>See Lockyer v. Andrade, </em>538 U.S. 63, 71-72, 123 S.Ct. 1166, 155 L.Ed.2d 144 (2003); 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1016-9\">The Supreme Court established a two-part test to determine whether a petitioner has received ineffective assistance of counsel. <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). A petitioner must establish that counsel\u2019s performance was deficient and that the deficient performance prejudiced the defendant. <em>Id. </em>The appropriate test for prejudice is whether \u201cthere is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 694, 104 S.Ct. 2052.</p>\n<p id=\"b1016-12\">Wilkerson\u2019s counsel failed to object to, or present new evidence regarding, an expansion from the indictment time period\u2014 that Wilkerson committed crimes between April 1, 1995 and August 1, 1996 \u2014 to the jury instructions \u2014 that he committed crimes between August 1,1993 and August 1, 1996. Yet neither counsel\u2019s failure, nor the expansion itself, had any effect on the outcome of the case. The entirety of the testimony adduced at trial was limited to crimes Wilkerson committed no earlier than January 1996, well within the indictment period. The change in dates made no difference to the jury. Likewise, objecting to the change or presenting new evidence regarding the new time period would have made no difference. Wilkerson was therefore not prejudiced by his counsel\u2019s performance. Accordingly, the state court\u2019s determination that Wilkerson did not receive unconstitutional ineffective assistance of counsel was neither contrary to, nor an unreasonable application of <em>Strickland, </em>and the district court\u2019s denial of habeas relief was appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b1016-13\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1016-10\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
