El-stein denying his application for cancellation of removal pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(b). <em>See In re Chang Liang </em>Zheng, No. A72 500 786 (BIA Nov. 6, 2007) <em>ajfg In re Chang Liang Zheng, </em>No. A72 500 786 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City, May 2, 2006). Zheng argues that the agency erred as a matter of law in concluding that he had not demonstrated the \u201cexceptional and extremely unusual hardship\u201d to a U.S.-citizen relative necessary for establishing eligibility for cancellation of removal under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(b)(l)(D). We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the facts and the record of prior proceedings, which we reference only as necessary to explain our decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-4\">Where the BIA affirms the IJ\u2019s decision and emphasizes particular aspects of it, \u201cwe review both the BIA\u2019s and the IJ\u2019s opinions.\u201d <em>Ming Xia Chen v. BIA, </em>435 F.3d 141, 144 (2d Cir.2006). We generally lack jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s discretionary \u201cexceptional and extremely unusual hardship\u201d determinations unless they raise either a constitutional claim or a question of law. <em>See Barco-Sandoval v. Gonzales, </em>516 F.3d 35, 38-39 (2d Cir.2008) (citing 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B)\u00a9 (denying courts jurisdiction to review BIA denials of discretionary relief) and \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D) (noting subsection (B) does not \u201cpreclud[e] review of constitutional claims or questions of law\u201d)). A petitioner may not \u201cus[e] the rhetoric of a \u2018constitutional claim\u2019 or \u2018question of law5 to disguise what is essentially a quarrel about fact-finding or the exercise of discretion.\u201d <em>Xiao Ji Chen v. United States Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>471 F.3d 315, 330 (2d Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b406-5\">Mindful of these principles, we consider Zheng\u2019s argument that the agency\u2019s failure to identify the factors relevant to its decision afforded him inadequate process as a matter of law. We conclude that the record will not support this claim. The IJ listed many specific factors supporting her decision, including the fact that Zheng had sent his son, a United States citizen, to live in China for three years, where he apparently received schooling and attained fluency in Chinese, undermining Zheng\u2019s claim that removal to China would pose an exceptional and extremely unusual hardship to the child. In the BIA decision, which we review alongside the IJ\u2019s because both together form the final agency determination, <em>see Ming Xia Chen v. BIA, </em>435 F.3d at 144, the Board held that the factors noted by the IJ, \u201cwhether considered individually or cumulatively,\u201d failed to establish an exceptional hardship pursuant to \u00a7 1229b(b)(l)(D). <em>In re Chang Liang Zheng, </em>A72 500 786, at 1. Thus, Zheng\u2019s contention that the agency afforded him inadequate process as a matter of law by failing to explain its reasoning lacks any foundation in fact or law. <em>See Barco-Sandoval v. Gonzales, </em>516 F.3d at 41 n. 6 (\u201cIf an argument is frivolous ... then regardless of the nomenclature or verbal formula used (ie., its rhetoric), we lack jurisdiction to review it.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b406-7\">Because Zheng\u2019s petition for review of the BIA\u2019s discretionary decision presents no colorable question of law, we lack jurisdiction to review it further. Accordingly, the petition for review is DISMISSED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
