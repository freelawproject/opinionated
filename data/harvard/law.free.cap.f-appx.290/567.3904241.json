We have reviewed the record and find no reversible error. Accordingly, we affirm for the reasons stated by the district court. <em>Taylor v. Todd, </em>No. 3:07-cv-00983-JFA-JRM, 2008 WL 612779 (D.S.C. Feb. 29, 2008). We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"ADl\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
