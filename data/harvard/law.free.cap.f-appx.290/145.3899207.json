She sued UDOC, four of its directors, and her former supervisor for violating Title VU\u2019s anti-retaliation provision and the First Amendment\u2019s free-exercise and iree-speech clauses. The district court granted the defendants\u2019 summary judgment motion, prompting the instant appeal. We affirm, concluding that (1) Kosan\u2019s Title VII claim fails because the defendants\u2019 termination reason was not a pretext for retaliation; (2) her free-exercise claim fails because any burden on her religion was the result of neutral, generally applicable UDOC policies; and (3) her free speech claim fails because her speech was not a matter of public concern.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-14\">\n<em>Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b168-15\">Kosan began working for UDOC in November 2001 as a counselor at the Central Utah Correctional Facility (CUCF). In August 2003, UDOC allowed her to transfer to another position in order to distance herself from her supervisor, Brandon Burr, whom Kosan had reported for sexual harassment. Four months later, in December 2003, UDOC\u2019s Program Services Director, Dale Schipannboord, gave Kosan a \u201cLetter of Warning\u201d for \u201ctelling Brandon Burr\u2019s LDS Stake President ... about unsubstantiated allegations of misconduct by Mr. Burr.\u201d ApltApp., Vol. 2 at 392. The letter notified Kosan that \u201charsher disciplinary sanctions\u201d would be considered if she repeated \u201cthis type of misconduct.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 393. And in August 2004, UDOC\u2019s Director of Institutional Operations, Belle Brough, ordered Kosan, under threat of disciplinary action, not to \u201cspeak or bring up past issues regarding Mr. Burr with anyone.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 400.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-16\">In September 2004, Kosan filed charges with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) and the Utah Anti-discrimination and Labor Division (UALD), claiming that she had suffered (1) discrimination based on national origin, and (2) retaliation for complaining of Burr\u2019s harassment. In January 2005, Ko-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>san agreed to dismiss the charges and to forego any Title VII claim based on those charges in exchange for UDOC\u2019s promises to keep Burr out of her chain of command, to refrain from further retaliation, and to audit her position to determine whether she was entitled to a reclassification.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-5\">In March 2005, after the parties had settled Kosan\u2019s discrimination charges, UDOC suspended her employment for several days because she had reported outside her chain of command that a coworker was sleeping on duty, had referred to him as a \u201cjoke,\u201d had failed to comply with an instruction to report the incident to an officer in the coworker\u2019s chain of command, and was untruthful during the subsequent investigation. Aplt.App., Vol. 3 at 421.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-6\">In May 2005, while auditing Kosan\u2019s position, UDOC began to suspect that Kosan had misrepresented her education credentials on several documents. In the position-analysis form she submitted in conjunction with her desk audit, she wrote in the form\u2019s education section, \u201cI have been awarded and brought with me my BA and DMA in dance/history and technique in French, Russian and Latin.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 491. Kosan had also claimed one or more bachelor\u2019s degrees on the resume that accompanied her initial job application:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-7\">BA Bachelor of Arts, Brigham Young University (May '78) Snow College (Sept '91) Equivalency given for my dance certification and education upon invitation to join both faculties as an instructor and lecturer.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b169-8\"><em>Id. </em>Finally, in her August 2000 application for Utah\u2019s Peace Officer Standards and Training (POST) program, in response to a prompt for \u201call colleges, universities and trade schools ... attended,\u201d Kosan wrote, \u201cBA equivalency given by Snow College to teach.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(underline omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b169-9\">To investigate the matter, UDOC\u2019s human-resources manager asked Kosan for transcripts substantiating the claimed degrees. Kosan then admitted that she \u201cdid not have a liberal college degree but had been given a BA equivalency when [she] was invited as a faculty member for both [Brigham Young University] and Snow College.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 456. On May 24, 2005, Kosan was removed from CUCF and notified by administrative complaint that UDOC intended to terminate her employment for falsely claiming a bachelor\u2019s degree.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-11\">Utah\u2019s Department of Public Safety investigated whether Kosan had \u201centered false information on [her] POST application,\u201d and it concluded in June 2005 that she did not. <em>Id. </em>at 478. The Department did, however, voice a \u201cconcern that the information [Kosan] provided inadvertently misled reviewers at a later date.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b169-12\">In July 2005, UDOC finalized her termination. Kosan then filed a second charge of discrimination with the EEOC and the UALD. She also contested her termination before the Utah Career Service Review Board (CSRB). The termination was initially upheld by a CSRB hearing officer, <em>id., </em>Vol. 4 at 751, but later overturned by a panel of CSRB members, who concluded that Kosan\u2019s \u201cequivalency statements were [not] intentionally misleading or otherwise a violation of Department policy,\u201d <em>id., </em>Vol. 3 at 498. In its written decision, the CSRB panel indicated that \u201cequivalency\u201d referred to Brigham Young University and Snow College\u2019s ability to hire Kosan as an instructor, even though she lacked the required college degree, by substituting Ko-san\u2019s practical experience for the degree. <em>Id. </em>at 492. UDOC appealed to the Utah Court of Appeals, but later dismissed the appeal after Kosan agreed to waive her right of reinstatement in exchange for UDOC paying the \u201cfull measure of her backpay\u201d and notifying her husband of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>certain jobs within UDOC. <em>Id., </em>Vol. 4 at 693.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-4\">After receiving a right to sue letter from the EEOC on her second charge of discrimination, Kosan commenced the instant litigation, claiming violations of her rights under Title VII (hostile work environment, sex discrimination, and retaliation), the Racketeer Influenced Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO), and federal and state constitutional guarantees of freedom of religion and speech. The district court entered summary judgment against Kosan on her federal claims, and dismissed her state-law claims without prejudice. Kosan now appeals the summary judgment as it relates to her Title VII retaliation claim and her federal constitutional claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-5\">\n<em>Discussion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b170-6\">I. Standards of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b170-7\">We review a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment de novo, applying the same legal standard as the district court. <em>Byers v. City of Albuquerque, </em>150 F.3d 1271, 1274 (10th Cir.1998). Summary judgment is appropriate \u201cif the pleadings, the discovery and disclosure materials on file, and any affidavits show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c). When applying this standard, we view the evidence and draw reasonable inferences in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party. <em>Byers, </em>150 F.3d at 1274.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-8\">II. Title VII Retaliation</p>\n<p id=\"b170-9\">Title VII makes it unlawful for an employer to discriminate against an employee for \u201copposing] any practice made an unlawful employment practice by [Title VII].\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-3(a). To successfully invoke this anti-retaliatory provision, an employee \u201cmust establish that retaliation played a part in the employment decision.\u201d <em>Fye v. Okla. Corp. Com\u2019n, </em>516 F.3d 1217, 1224 (10th Cir.2008). This may be accomplished by \u201cdirectly showing] that retaliatory animus played a motivating part in the employment decision\u201d or, if there is no direct evidence of the employer\u2019s motive, by relying \u201con the familiar three-part <em>McDonnell Douglas </em>framework to prove that the employer\u2019s proffered reason for its decision is a pretext for retaliation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1225 (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b170-12\">Kosan relies on <em>McDonnell Douglas, </em>which first requires the employee to \u201cestablish a prima facie case of retaliation by showing (1) she engaged in protected opposition to Title VII discrimination; (2) she suffered an adverse employment action; and (3) there is a causal connection between the protected activity and the adverse employment action.\u201d <em>Fye, </em>516 F.3d at 1227 (quotation omitted). Once the employee establishes a prima facie case, the burden shifts to the employer to produce evidence of a non-discriminatory reason for the conduct, and then the employee has the burden of demonstrating pretext. <em>Fischer v. Forestwood Co., Inc., </em>525 F.3d 972, 979 (10th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b170-13\">The district court accepted Kosan\u2019s argument that she had engaged in protected opposition to discrimination. The district court also accepted Kosan\u2019s assertion that her suspension and termination were adverse employment actions causally connected to protected activities.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Kosan did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>not, however, challenge whether UDOC had articulated legitimate, nondiserimina-tory reasons for the suspension and termination. Nor did she argue that UDOC\u2019s reasons for the suspension were pretextual. Consequently, the district court focused on Kosan\u2019s only remaining argument: that UDOC\u2019s reason for terminating her \u2014 falsely claiming a bachelor\u2019s degree \u2014 was a pretext for retaliation. We likewise limit our focus to determining whether UDOC\u2019s termination reason was pretextual, and we consider only those theories of pretext advanced in the district court. <em>Cf. Herrera v. Lufkin Indus., Inc., </em>474 F.3d 675, 684 (10th Cir.2007) (considering on appeal only those arguments presented to the district court regarding the existence of an implied-in-fact employment contract).</p>\n<p id=\"b171-5\">To show pretext, Kosan \u201cmust produce evidence of such weaknesses, implausibilities, inconsistencies, incoherencies, or contradictions in [UDOC\u2019s] proffered legitimate reasonf] for its action that a reasonable factfinder could rationally find [the reason] unworthy of credence and hence infer that [UDOC] did not act for the asserted non-discriminatory reason[].\u201d <em>Fye, </em>516 F.3d at 1228 (quotation omitted). Kosan argues that pretext is demonstrated by four points: (1) the CSRB\u2019s reversal of her termination; (2) the Utah Department of Public Safety\u2019s finding that she did not enter false information on her POST application; (3) the fact that UDOC issued its administrative complaint threatening to terminate Kosan before the deadline it had imposed for Kosan to provide transcripts supporting her degrees; and (4) her alleged misrepresentations were not materially significant.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-10\">First, in regard to the CSRB\u2019s reversal of Kosan\u2019s termination, \u201c[t]he pertinent question in determining pretext is not whether [UDOC] was right to think [Ko-san] engaged in misconduct, but whether [UDOC\u2019s] belief was genuine or pretextual.\u201d <em>Tran v. Trustees of State Colleges in Colo., </em>355 F.3d 1263, 1270 (10th Cir.2004) (quotation omitted). The CSRB determined only that Kosan had not intentionally misled UDOC, and therefore did not violate UDOC\u2019s policy regarding falsifying records. The CSRB did not determine, as we must, whether UDOC could have genuinely believed that Kosan falsely claimed to have a bachelor\u2019s degree. We conclude that no reasonable jury could dispute the genuineness of UDOC\u2019s belief. Specifically, Kosan\u2019s assertion on the position-analysis form that she had \u201cbeen awarded and brought with me my BA\u201d suggests only one thing \u2014 that she indeed possessed a bachelor\u2019s degree. Kosan\u2019s resume also portrays her as possessing a bachelor\u2019s degree from at least Brigham Young University, given the language, \u201cBachelor of Arts, Brigham Young University (May '78).\u201d ApltApp., Vol. 3 at 491. While Kosan attempted to explain to UDOC that she had \u201cBA equivalency,\u201d and had even mentioned \u201c[ejquivalency\u201d on her resume, <em>id., </em>we are not persuaded that her use of that term would have dispelled the reasonable belief that she had falsely claimed a bachelor\u2019s degree. As used in this case, \u201cequivalency\u201d simply refers to Brigham Young University and Snow College overlooking her lack of a bachelor\u2019s degree and employing her based on experience. The fact that those institutions substituted experience for education in no way means that Kosan was \u201cawarded\u201d or otherwise in possession of a bachelor\u2019s degree.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>Second, regarding the Utah Department of Public Safety\u2019s finding that Kosan did not enter false information on her POST application, it likewise does not undercut the genuineness of UDOC\u2019s termination reason. As far as we can tell, the Department\u2019s investigation was limited to Kosan claiming a bachelor\u2019s degree from Snow College. Consequently, the results of the investigation would have no bearing on Kosan\u2019s claim to a degree from Brigham Young University. But more importantly, the Department recognized that the information Kosan provided on her POST application was potentially misleading. Thus, UDOC\u2019s reliance on the application to terminate Kosan does not establish pretext.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-4\">Third, as for the timing of UDOC\u2019s administrative complaint threatening termination, there is no hint of pretext. The complaint was apparently issued several hours before the 5:00 p.m. deadline on May 24 for Kosan to produce transcripts showing a bachelor\u2019s degree. But there was no reason for UDOC to wait until 5:00 p.m., as Kosan had stated five days earlier that she did not have a degree.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-5\">Kosan\u2019s fourth and final pretext argument is that her misrepresentations \u201cwere not materially significant.\u201d Aplt. Br. at 20. She claims that after submitting her position-analysis form, she \u201cattempted to correct [it]\u201d but was told by her supervisor, Wayne Larson, and the human resources officer assigned to her desk audit, Mike Tribe, that \u201cher corrections did not matter.\u201d <em>Id.</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Our review of the record, however, reveals that only Tribe made such a statement. <em>See </em>ApltApp., Vol. 2 at 310-12, 315. And even then, he simply told Kosan that his focus in evaluating the desk audit was on what she had accomplished after becoming employed at UDOC. <em>Id. </em>at 310. Nothing he said indicates that the misrepresentation of a bachelor\u2019s degree is not a terminable offense. Indeed, the undisputed evidence shows that UDOC has terminated at least fifteen employees since 1997 for \u201cfalsifying some type of record.\u201d <em>Id., </em>Vol. 1 at 189. Further, when a UDOC employment application has been falsified, Utah Administrative Code \u00a7 R251-105-4(3) authorizes termination without regard to the significance of the falsification.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-9\">We conclude that there is no genuine issue of material fact in regard to pretext and that the district court properly granted summary judgment against Kosan on her Title VII retaliation claim.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b172-10\">III. First Amendment Claims</p>\n<p id=\"b172-11\">Because this case also \u201cimplicates First Amendment freedoms, we perform an independent examination of the whole record in order to ensure that the judgment protects the rights of free expression.\u201d <em>Faus-tin v. City &amp; County of Denver, </em>423 F.3d 1192, 1196 (10th Cir.2005). Additionally, because we conclude in the following sections that Kosan has not shown a constitutional violation, we need not reach the individual Defendants-Appellees\u2019 argument that they are entitled to qualified immunity. <em>See Christiansen v. City of Tulsa, </em>332 F.3d 1270, 1278 (10th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b173-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>A. Free Exercise Claim</p>\n<p id=\"A2Z\">The First Amendment\u2019s Free Exercise Clause \u201crequires government respect for, and noninterference with, the religious beliefs and practices of our Nation\u2019s people.\u201d <em>Cutter v. Wilkinson, </em>544 U.S. 709, 719, 125 S.Ct. 2113, 161 L.Ed.2d 1020 (2005). Kosan argues that Schipannboord\u2019s Letter of Warning, which admonished her for telling Burr\u2019s Stake President \u201cabout unsubstantiated allegations of misconduct by Mr. Burr,\u201d and which cautioned her against repeating that \u201ctype of misconduct,\u201d Aplt.App., Vol. 2 at 392-93, intruded upon her \u201cright to consult with her clergy,\u201d Aplt. Br. at 24. But Burr\u2019s Stake President was not Kosan\u2019s Stake President. And Kosan did, at some time, consult with her own Stake President and Bishop regarding Burr. ApltApp., Vol. 1 at 127.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-5\">Further, even if the Letter burdened Kosan\u2019s ability to consult with her own clergy, there is no evidence that the policies the Letter effectuated were religiously motivated or applicable to only religious conduct. \u201cNeutral rules of general applicability ordinarily do not raise free exercise concerns even if they incidentally burden a particular religious practice or belief.\u201d <em>Axson-Flynn v. Johnson, </em>356 F.3d 1277, 1294 (10th Cir.2004) (footnote omitted). The Letter of Warning indicated that Kosan\u2019s actions violated various UDOC policies, including prohibitions against defaming administrators or staff, revealing confidential information, and discrediting UDOC or causing the public to lose confidence in UDOC. And it noted that the policies applied when \u201cdiscussing Departmental business ... with those in the community.\u201d Aplt.App., Vol. 2 at 393. Because these policies are religiously neutral and are applicable generally, not just in her consultations with clergy, Kosan\u2019s free-exercise claim fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-8\">Free Speech Claim</p>\n<p id=\"b173-9\">\u201cThe freedom of speech guaranteed by the Constitution embraces at the least the liberty to discuss publicly and truthfully all matters of public concern without previous restraint or fear of subsequent punishment.\u201d <em>Federal Election Com\u2019n v. Wisconsin Right to Life, Inc., </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 2652, 2666, 168 L.Ed.2d 329 (2007) (quotation omitted). \u201cSo long as employees are speaking as citizens about matters of public concern, they must face only those speech restrictions that are necessary for their employers to operate efficiently and effectively.\u201d <em>Garcetti v. Cebal-los, </em>547 U.S. 410, 419, 126 S.Ct. 1951, 164 L.Ed.2d 689 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b173-11\">Kosan argues that \u201cthe policy of [UDOC] combined with the actions of Defendant Brough and Defendant Schipannboord violated [her] free speech rights.\u201d Aplt. Br. at 27. Her argument appears to encompass Schipannboord\u2019s Letter of Warning and Brough\u2019s instruction not to \u201cspeak or bring up past issues regarding Mr. Burr with anyone.\u201d Aplt.App., Vol. 2 at 400.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We conclude that Kosan\u2019s free-speech rights were not violated because she was not disciplined or threatened with discipline for speaking on a matter of public concern.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-12\">\u201c[P]ublic concern is something that is a subject of legitimate news interest; that is, a subject of general interest and of value and concern to the public at the time of publication.\u201d <em>City of San Diego, Cal. v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number><em>Roe, </em>543 U.S. 77, 83-84, 125 S.Ct. 521, 160 L.Ed.2d 410 (2004). But \u201cspeech relating to internal personnel disputes and working conditions ordinarily will not be viewed as addressing matters of public concern.\u201d <em>David v. City &amp; County of Denver, </em>101 F.3d 1344, 1355 (10th Cir.1996). Kosan\u2019s communication with Burr\u2019s Stake President, and the resulting limitations imposed by Schipannboord and Brough, concerned her allegations of misconduct against Burr \u2014 specifically, sexual harassment. Nothing in the record indicates, however, that Kosan spoke, or was prohibited from speaking about, sexual harassment \u201cas a widespread practice affecting [UDOC\u2019s] performance of its public responsibilities.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1356 n. 2. Because Kosan\u2019s speech and the resulting limitations related to a purely personal grievance affecting her own conditions of employment, her free-speech claim fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-5\">\n<em>Conclusion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b174-6\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b168-12\"> After examining the briefs and appellate record, this panel has determined unanimously that oral argument would not materially assist the determination of this appeal. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument. This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed. R.App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b170-10\">. On appeal, Kosan adds to the list of adverse actions that her work station was moved to a closet, she was given no assistance in completing her position-analysis form, and her husband, who also worked for UDOC, received a letter of reprimand. Aplt. Br. at 15. But she did not raise these actions below when discussing adverse employment actions. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number><em>see </em>Aplt.App., Vol. 1 at 266, and we decline to consider them for the first time on appeal, <em>see Utah Lighthouse Ministry v.

While the district court stated that it would not consider Kosan\u2019s materiality argument because she failed to provide record support, <em>see </em>Aplt.App., Vol. 4 at 776 n. 103, it appears that the district court did in fact consider the argument, <em>see id. </em>at 779-780.
