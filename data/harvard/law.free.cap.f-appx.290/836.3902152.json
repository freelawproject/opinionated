In 1987, at the age of eighteen, Martinez-Bahena was convicted for the felony sale, transportation, and possession of cocaine in Orange County, California, and received thirty-six months probation and ninety days custody as a condition of probation. Five months after this arrest, in 1988, Martinez-Bahena was convicted for the felony sale and transportation of cocaine. As a result of this second conviction, the State of California revoked Martinez-Bahena\u2019s probation and sentenced him to two years imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-7\">Fresh out of jail, Martinez-Bahena continued to run afoul of the law, albeit in relatively minor ways. In 1989, at the age of twenty, Martinez-Bahena spent thirty days in jail for a misdemeanor battery offense and probation violation. In 1991, at the age of twenty-two, he spent another ten days in jail for presenting false identification to a police officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-8\">Then, Martinez-Bahena appeared to turn a corner, both professionally and personally. Over the next fifteen years, and while residing in the United States, Martinez-Bahena had no arrests or convictions. In 1991, he began working at Bridgford Foods Corporation as a bakery supervisor and continued there on a full-time basis until late 2002. In 2003, he left Bridgford Foods and began working two jobs: one part-time as a technician at North County Toyota, and another full-time as a machine operator at Laguna Cookie Company.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-9\">During this time, Martinez-Bahena also began a family with Rosalba Atanacio Or-duna-Quesada. The two began their relationship in approximately 1990, and married in 2001. Though they are now separated, they have four children and three step-children, all of whom are United States citizens.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-11\">In 1998, Martinez-Bahena received a Certificate of Rehabilitation from the State of California as to his two prior felony drug convictions, committed over ten years earlier. Under California Penal Code \u00a7 4852.13, a person who has been released from a state prison, who has not been incarcerated since his release, and who presents satisfactory evidence of a three-year residence in California, may apply for such a certificate, which embodies a finding that the person is rehabilitated. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 4852.13(a). The State then begins a formal investigation to determine whether a full pardon from the Governor would be appropriate. <em>Id. </em>At the time of his deportation, Martinez-Bahena\u2019s application for a pardon had yet to be adjudicated by the State. A pardon does not officially remove the conviction from an individual\u2019s criminal record.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-12\">On March 14, 2001, Martinez-Bahena filed an Application to Register Permanent Residence or Adjust Status, in an attempt to gain lawful status as a permanent resident of the United States. Immigration officials denied that application based on his two prior felony convictions in California. In April 2004, Martinez-Bahena was charged with being an illegal alien present in the United States after having been convicted of a crime classified as an aggravated felony. One month later, an immigration judge issued an order deporting Martinez-Bahena to Mexico after denying his application for voluntary departure.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-13\">Martinez-Bahena returned to the United States illegally after six months in Mexico, initially residing in California, then moving to Tennessee in early 2005. He immediately began working two jobs \u2014 one as a full-time forklift operator for A.P.L. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"838\">*838</page-number>Logistics, and another as a part-time banquet server for Sheraton Hotels and Resorts.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-4\">The events that give rise to the instant case began on February 1, 2006, when an officer with the Metropolitan Nashville Police Department stopped Martinez-Bahena for a routine traffic violation. Upon conducting a search via his cruiser\u2019s on-board computer, the officer discovered that Martinez-Bahena was a previously deported aggravated felon and placed him under arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-5\">A week later, on February 8, 2006, a federal grand jury sitting in the Middle District of Tennessee indicted Martinez-Bahena on one count of illegal reentry into the United States after having been removed or deported subsequent to the commission of an aggravated felony, in violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1326(a) and (b)(2). On July 10, 2006, Martinez-Bahena pleaded guilty to the indictment without a plea agreement, which carried with it a maximum statutory penalty of twenty years imprisonment, with a fine of up to $250,000, a mandatory $100 special assessment fee, and a term of supervised release of not more than three years.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-6\">The Pre-sentence Investigation Report (\u201cPSR\u201d) determined that, according to the United States Sentencing Guidelines, Martinez-Bahena\u2019s base offense level is eight. U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual (\u201cU.S.S.G.\u201d) \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(i). The PSR increased the offense level by sixteen levels because Martinez-Bahena previously was deported or unlawfully remained in the United States after a conviction for a felony that was a drug trafficking offense for which the sentence imposed exceeded thirteen months. <em>Id. </em>Under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3El.l(a), the PSR recommended a three-point decrease for acceptance of responsibility. Based on a total offense level of twenty-one and a criminal history category of one, the PSR calculated the Guidelines sentencing range as thirty-seven to forty-six months.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-8\">Prior to sentencing, Martinez-Bahena filed a Sentencing Position, a Sentencing Memorandum, and a Motion for a Substantial Downward Departure, requesting a sentence below the Guidelines range under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K2.0 based on his cultural assimilation, his long work history in the United States, his family ties, the nonviolent nature of the underlying felonies, the length of time between the convictions and his arrest, his attempts to expunge his criminal record and attain legal resident status, and the disparity in sentencing resulting from the lack of a \u201cfast-track\u201d program in the Middle District of Tennessee, which permits defendants indicted for illegal re-entry to receive a four-level reduction upon motion by the Government.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-9\">The Government responded that, as an alien who had been previously deported, Martinez-Bahena should be sentenced within the Guidelines range, that his case did not present facts outside the heartland of other illegal reentry cases, and that the absence of a fast-track program did not create unwarranted sentencing disparities.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-10\">At the sentencing hearing, the district court noted that he had read and reviewed all the submissions, including the several letters submitted in support, the various papers, and the sentencing memorandum. After hearing testimony, reviewing additional evidence, and hearing the arguments of the parties, the court denied the motion for a downward departure and sentenced Martinez-Bahena to thirty-seven months imprisonment, the bottom of the Guidelines range. The court also sentenced Martinez-Bahena to two years of supervised release, to be suspended or tolled while Martinez-Bahena remained outside the jurisdiction of the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-11\">In imposing the sentence, the court outlined the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors, ac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"839\">*839</page-number>knowledged the advisory nature of the Guidelines, and explained the reason for the sentence:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b861-5\">In the opinion of the Court, a guideline sentence is appropriate. I am denying the request for a nonguideline sentence either through 3558 or a downward departure. In my view, a guideline sentence is necessary most specifically for deterrence. Last time Mr. Martinez was deported, he was back within a few months. According to the defendant\u2019s brief, about two months. He testified about six months. He needs to be deterred. Others need to be deterred. And there is a lack of appreciation for the fact that his presence in this country is illegal.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b861-6\">Many of the arguments that are presented are important to consider in the policy decisions about who should be considered illegal or not illegal, but his presence in the United States is illegal.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AYi\">The court then concluded that \u201c[t]here are sad family consequences from this case, regrettably. That\u2019s ordinary rather than extraordinary. Most cases have painful consequences for family members. I wish it were otherwise, but it is not.\u201d At the close of the hearing, Martinez-Bahena\u2019s counsel stated: \u201cI think for appellate purposes I am required to say that we object to the sentence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b861-7\">Martinez-Bahena timely appealed his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-8\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b861-9\">I. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b861-10\">The district court\u2019s task at sentencing is to \u201cimpose a sentence sufficient, but not greater than necessary, to comply with the purposes\u201d of the factors set forth in \u00a7 3553(a). 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). \u201cThe court need not recite the[ ] factors [listed in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) ] but must articulate its reasoning in deciding to impose a sentence in order to allow for reasonable appellate review.\u201d <em>United States v. Penson, </em>526 F.3d 331, 336 (6th Cir.2008) (quoting <em>United States v. Kirby, </em>418 F.3d 621, 626 (6th Cir.2005)).</p>\n<p id=\"b861-13\">Under <em>Rita v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007), and <em>Gall v. United </em>States, - U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007), we review a district court\u2019s sentencing determination for reasonableness under a deferential abuse-of-discretion standard.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b861-18\">This review entails a two-step process. The appellate court \u201cmust first ensure that the district court committed no significant procedural error, such as failing to calculate (or improperly calculating) the Guidelines range, treating the Guidelines as mandatory, failing to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, selecting a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts, or failing to adequately explain the chosen sentence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b861-19\"><em>Penson, </em>526 F.3d at 336 (quoting <em>Gall, </em>128 S.Ct. at 597); <em>see also United States v. Bolds, </em>511 F.3d 568, 581 (6th Cir.2007) (\u201c[I]n reviewing sentences for procedural reasonableness we must ensure that the district court: (1) properly calculated the applicable advisory Guidelines range; (2) considered the other \u00a7 3553(a) factors as well as the parties\u2019 arguments for a sentence outside the Guidelines range; and (3) adequately articulated its reasoning for imposing the particular sentence chosen, including any rejection of the parties\u2019 arguments for an outside-Guidelines sentence and any decision to deviate from the advisory Guidelines range.\u201d); <em>United States v. Lalonde, </em>509 F.3d 750, 769-70 (6th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b861-20\">After we have found the district court\u2019s sentencing to be procedurally sound, we must \u201cthen consider the substantive reasonableness of the sentence imposed under an abuse-of-discretion standard.\u201d <em>Gall, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"840\">*840</page-number>128 S.Ct. at 597. We have held that \u201c[a] sentence may be substantively unreasonable where the district court selects the sentence arbitrarily, bases the sentence on impermissible factors, fails to consider pertinent \u00a7 3553(a) factors or gives an unreasonable amount of weight to any pertinent factor.\u201d <em>United States v. Jones, </em>489 F.3d 243, 252 (6th Cir.2007) (internal quotations and alterations omitted). This consideration should be based on \u201cthe totality of the circumstances.\u201d <em>Gall, </em>128 S.Ct. at 597.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-4\">\u201cOn abuse-of-discretion review, [we give] due deference to the [district [c]ourt\u2019s reasoned and reasonable decision that the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, on the whole, justified the sentence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 602. <em>Gall </em>instructs us that a district court has not necessarily committed reversible error by attaching great weight to any single factor, <em>id. </em>at 600, nor if we \u201cmight reasonably have concluded that a different sentence was appropriate,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 597. The \u201ccentral lesson\u201d . to be learned from the Supreme Court\u2019s recent sentencing decisions is \u201cthat district courts have considerable discretion in this area and thus deserve the benefit of the doubt when we review their sentences and the reasons given for them.\u201d <em>United States v. Vonner, </em>516 F.3d 382, 392 (6th Cir.2008) (en banc). Accordingly, we \u201ccredit a within-Guidelines sentence with a rebuttable presumption of substantive reasonableness.\u201d <em>United States v. Wilms, </em>495 F.3d 277, 280 (6th Cir.2007). This \u201cpresumption,\u201d however, is not a \u201cpresumption\u201d as generally defined; \u201crather than having independent legal effect, [it] simply recognizes the real-world circumstance that when the judge\u2019s discretionary decision accords with the Commission\u2019s view of the appropriate application of \u00a7 3553(a) in the mine run of cases, it is probable that the sentence is reasonable.\u201d <em>Rita, </em>127 S.Ct. at 2465.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-5\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b862-6\">On appeal, Martinez-Bahena challenges only the substantive reasonableness of his sentence. He contends that the age of his prior felony conviction, lack of deportation proceedings for years thereafter, his efforts to obtain certificates of rehabilitation and pardons for those offenses, his years without any other offenses, and his other efforts at rehabilitation, counsel against applying the sixteen point increase for his prior felony drug conviction. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(i). The Government, in turn, argues that the district court fully considered both the Guidelines range and all of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors before imposing the sentence, and that Martinez-Bahena\u2019s prior criminal conduct demonstrates that he is a \u201cproven, dangerous felon\u201d who \u201chas a propensity to commit crime.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b862-7\">The central question in this case is whether the district court, by emphasizing the need to deter illegal aliens from reentering the United States, either failed to consider pertinent \u00a7 3553(a) factors or gave an unreasonable amount of weight to any pertinent factor. After reviewing the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, the court sentenced Martinez-Bahena to thirty-seven months imprisonment, the bottom of the Guidelines range, and two years supervised release to be tolled while he remained outside the jurisdiction of the United States. As noted above, Martinez-Bahena received a sixteen-level enhancement for two prior felony drug convictions he received over fifteen-years prior to his initial deportation, which raised his Guidelines range from zero to six months to thirty-seven to forty-six months, a nearly eight-fold increase.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-8\">A. Substantive Reasonableness</p>\n<p id=\"b862-9\">Under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(i), a previously deported alien receives a sixteen-level increase in the recommended <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"841\">*841</page-number>Guidelines range for illegal re-entry if that individual has \u201ca conviction for a felony that is (i) a drug trafficking offense for which the sentence imposed exceeded 13 months; (ii) a crime of violence; (iii) a firearms offense; (iv) a child pornography offense; (v) a national security or terrorism offense; (vi) a human trafficking offense; or (vii) an alien smuggling offense ...\u201d As relevant here, a \u201cdrug trafficking offense\u201d is defined in the Application Notes as \u201can offense under federal, state, or local law that prohibits the manufacture, import, export, distribution, or dispensing of a controlled substance (or a counterfeit substance) or the possession of a controlled substance (or a counterfeit substance) with intent to manufacture, import, export, distribute, or dispense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 2L1.2 cmt. n. 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-5\">The record reveals no indication that the district court based Martinez-Bahena\u2019s sentence on impermissible factors. The record readily demonstrates that the court considered both the relevant \u00a7 3553(a) factors and the defendant\u2019s arguments for leniency. Additionally, we find that the court did not give undue weight to the need for deterrence, a specifically enumerated consideration under \u00a7 3553(a). 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b863-7\">We also find that the absence of a fast-track program in the Middle District of Tennessee does not create an unwarranted sentencing disparity. Section 5K3.1 of the Sentencing Guidelines provides for a downward departure of up to four levels upon motion of the Government in districts where an early disposition, or fast-track, program has been authorized by the Attorney General of the United States and the United States Attorney for the district in which the court resides. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K3.1. We have held that the absence of fast-track programs in certain districts does not create unwarranted sentencing disparities. <em>United States v. Hernandez-Fierros, </em>453 F.3d 309, 314 (6th Cir.2006) (\u201c[Fjast-track guidelines reductions were specifically authorized by statute due to the unique and pressing problems related to immigration in certain districts. As a result, such a disparity does not run counter to \u00a7 3553(a)\u2019s instruction to avoid unnecessary sentencing disparities\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b863-9\">B. Tolling the Period of Supervised Release</p>\n<p id=\"b863-10\">The district court tolled the period of supervised release while MartinezBahena remained outside the jurisdiction of the United States following his imprisonment. Following sentencing in this case, and as the Government concedes, the Sixth Circuit issued an en banc decision in <em>United States v. Ossa-Gallegos, </em>491 F.3d 537 (6th Cir.2007), which held that the period of supervised release cannot be tolled during a defendant\u2019s absence from the United States. <em>Id. </em>at 538-39.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-11\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b863-12\">Having studied the record on appeal and the briefs of the parties, we are not persuaded that the sentence imposed by the district court is unreasonable in light of the factors set forth in \u00a7 3553(a); however, we find that the district court erred in tolling the period of supervised release while Martinez-Bahena remained outside the jurisdiction of the United States following his imprisonment. Accordingly we VACATE the judgment of the district court and REMAND for resentencing with instructions that the remand be limited to setting forth lawful conditions of supervised release.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
