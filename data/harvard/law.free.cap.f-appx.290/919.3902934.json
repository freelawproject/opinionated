Upon examination, this panel unanimously agrees that oral argument is not needed. Fed. R.App. P. 34.</p>\n<p id=\"b942-4\">Booth challenges events that occurred while he was incarcerated at the Chippewa Correctional Facility (URF). Booth alleged that 1) on October 20, 2005, URF librarian Chris Henson sent Booth back to his unit after only one hour of law library time because Booth had to use the restroom; 2) on October 26, 2005, URF library manager Amanda Winnicki denied Booth\u2019s Step I grievance concerning Henson\u2019s alleged conduct; 3) on October 27, 2005, Henson again sent Booth back to his unit even though he had not finished his legal research; 4) on November 23, 2005, URF deputy warden Gregory McQuiggin denied Booth\u2019s Step II grievance appeal concerning Henson\u2019s alleged conduct; 5) on December 15, 2005, Henson allegedly retaliated against Booth by fabricating a major misconduct ticket against him; 6) on December 20, 2005, a URF hearing officer found Booth guilty of the misconduct ticket; and, 7) on January 9, 2006, the hearing officer found Booth guilty of a second misconduct ticket allegedly written by Henson to retaliate against Booth.</p>\n<p id=\"b942-5\">In April 2006, Booth filed a pleading that he styled as a \u201ccriminal complaint\u201d wherein he sought relief under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 241 and 242.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The only prayer for relief set forth in the complaint is the issuance of a warrant for the arrest of the defendants. Noting that Booth lacked standing to compel the state to pursue criminal actions, the district court construed Booth\u2019s complaint as one filed pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. Booth essentially claimed that defendants interfered with his right of access to the courts by denying him time in the law library. Booth also claimed that defendants retaliated against him by fabricating misconduct charges against him after he filed grievances concerning the denial of access to the law library. The district court dismissed Booth\u2019s complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e), \u00a7 1915A, and 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997e(c).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Booth has filed a timely appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b942-10\">On appeal, Booth argues that the district court erred by applying the wrong law when it construed his complaint as having been filed pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. Booth maintains that his action was brought under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 241 and 242. This court reviews de novo a district court\u2019s decision to dismiss an action under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e), \u00a7 1915A.</p>\n<p id=\"b942-11\">The only prayer for relief sought in Booth\u2019s complaint, the issuance of a warrant for the arrest of the defendants, is not available to a private citizen.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> \u201c[A] private citizen lacks a judicially cognizable interest <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"921\">*921</page-number>in the prosecution or nonprosecution of another.\u201d <em>Linda R.S. v. Richard D., </em>410 U.S. 614, 619, 93 S.Ct. 1146, 35 L.Ed.2d 536 (1973); <em>see also United States v. Oguaju, </em>76 Fed.Appx. 579, 581 (6th Cir.2003) (holding that the district court properly dismissed defendant\u2019s claim filed pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 241 and 242 because he had no private right of action under either of those criminal statutes). Because Booth lacks standing to file an action under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 241 and 242, we affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal of Booth\u2019s action without addressing the merits of his claims. <em>Southwest Williamson County Community Ass\u2019n v. Slater, </em>173 F.3d 1033, 1036 (6th Cir.1999) (\u201c[t]his court can affirm the district court on alternate grounds supported by the record.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b943-6\">For all of the reasons set forth above, we AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b942-6\">. The caption on Booth's \"criminal complaint\u201d reads: <em>\u201cUnited States v. Chris Henson, et. al., </em>Defendants.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b942-7\">. The district court also noted that Booth had failed sufficiently to allege and to show exhaustion of available administrative remedies. Subsequent to the district court\u2019s decision, the Supreme Court held, in <em>Jones v. Bock, </em>549 U.S. 199, 127 S.Ct. 910, 919, 166 L.Ed.2d 798 (2007), that the exhaustion requirement is an affirmative defense, and thus, state exhaustion does not have to be pleaded by the plaintiff. Because the district court properly concluded that exhaustion of remedies was not disposi-tive in this case, and did not rely on Booth\u2019s failure to plead exhaustion to dismiss the complaint, any error in the district court\u2019s decision with respect to the exhaustion requirement is harmless.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b942-13\">. The prayer in Booth\u2019s complaint states: \"Wherefore, I pray that a warrant issue for the arrest of all said defendants.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
