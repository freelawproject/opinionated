Morace denying his application for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d). <em>In re Ousamane Diallo, </em>No. A 97 969 877 (BIA Nov. 30, 2007), <em>aff'g </em>No. A 97 969 877 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>(Immig. Ct. N.Y. City, Mar. 18, 2006). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-4\">When the BIA issues an opinion that fully adopts the IJ\u2019s decision, this Court reviews the IJ\u2019s decision. <em>See, e.g., Chun Gao v. Gonzales, </em>424 F.3d 122, 124 (2d Cir.2005). We review the agency\u2019s factual findings, including adverse credibility findings, under the substantial evidence standard, treating them as \u201cconclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>see, e.g., Shu Wen Sun v. BIA, </em>510 F.3d 377, 379 (2d Cir. 2007). However, we will vacate and remand for new findings if the agency\u2019s reasoning or its fact-finding process was sufficiently flawed. <em>Cao He Lin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>428 F.3d 391, 406 (2d Cir.2005); <em>Tian-Yong Chen v. INS, </em>359 F.3d 121, 129 (2d Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b442-5\">In this case, we need not reach the merits of the agency\u2019s adverse credibility determination, because, as the Government argues, Diallo failed to exhaust any challenge to that determination. In addition to the statutory requirement that petitioners exhaust each category of relief, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d)(1), this Court generally will not consider arguments regarding individual issues that were not exhausted before the agency. <em>Lin Zhong v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>480 F.3d 104, 107 n. 1, 122-123 (2d Cir.2007). While not jurisdictional, this judicially-imposed issue exhaustion requirement is mandatory. <em>Id. </em>at 119-120. In particular, a petitioner must challenge all findings that are dispositive of his claims, and the failure to do so is fatal to his petition for review. <em>See Steeve-nez v. Gonzales, </em>476 F.3d 114, 117-118 (2d Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b442-6\">In his appeal to the BIA, Diallo failed to articulate any error in the IJ\u2019s credibility determination, stating only that the IJ \u201cincorrectly found\u201d that his testimony was \u201cincredible.\u201d While the BIA affirmed the IJ\u2019s credibility findings, its mere mention of those findings does not excuse Diallo\u2019s failure to offer any meaningful challenge before the BIA. <em>Cf. Xian Tuan Ye v. DHS, </em>446 F.3d 289, 296-97 (2d Cir.2006); <em>Waldron v. INS, </em>17 F.3d 511, 515 n. 7 (2d Cir.1993). Indeed, the BIA expressly noted in its decision that Diallo argued \u201cgenerally\u201d that he testified credibly, but failed to \u201cspecifically address the bases for the [IJ\u2019s] adverse credibility finding.\u201d While Diallo challenges the IJ\u2019s credibility findings with much greater specificity before this Court, considering his newly-minted arguments would defeat the purpose of the issue exhaustion requirement\u2014to allow the agency to review its own decisions for error after having the opportunity to consider the applicant\u2019s arguments. <em>See Theodoropoulos v. I.N.S., </em>358 F.3d 162, 171 (2d Cir.2004) (\u201c[A]t least one of the purposes served by the exhaustion requirement contained in \u00a7 1252(d) is to ensure that the INS, as the agency responsible for construing and applying the immigration laws and implementing regulations, has had a full opportunity to consider a petitioner\u2019s claims before they are submitted for review by a federal court.\u201d); <em>see generally Lin Zhong, </em>480 F.3d at 123, 124 n. 24.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-8\">Thus, because we find that Diallo failed to exhaust any challenge to the agency\u2019s credibility findings, and because those findings were dispositive of each of his applications for relief, <em>see Majidi v. Gonzales, </em>430 F.3d 77, 81-82 (2d Cir.2005), we deny the petition for review, <em>see Steevenez, </em>476 F.3d at 117-118.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-9\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
