He argues that the district court clearly erred in finding that he was not a minor participant under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3R1.2(b). Members of the conspiracy departed Ibarra\u2019s apartment to engage in the methamphetamine transaction leading to Ibarra\u2019s arrest; Ibarra\u2019s actions during the transaction were consistent with that of a lookout; and a search of Ibarra\u2019s apartment revealed methamphetamine, digital scales, weapons, ledgers, and $142,897 in cash. The district court\u2019s finding that Ibarra was not a minor participant was plausible in light of the record as a whole and, thus, not clearly erroneous. <em>See United States v. Villanueva, </em>408 F.3d 193, 203-04 (5th Cir.2005). Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b715-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
