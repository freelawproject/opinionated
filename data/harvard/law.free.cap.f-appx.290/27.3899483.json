Barnhart, </em>192 Fed.Appx. 589 (9th Cir.2006). We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-26\">We review a district court\u2019s denial of attorneys\u2019 fees under the EAJA for abuse of discretion. <em>See Pierce v. Underwood, </em>487 U.S. 552, 559, 108 S.Ct. 2541, 101 L.Ed.2d 490 (1988). A district court abuses its discretion when it bases its ruling on \u201can erroneous view of the law or on a clearly erroneous assessment of the evidence.\u201d <em>Cooter &amp; Gell v. Hartmarx Corp., </em>496 U.S. 384, 405, 110 S.Ct. 2447, 110 L.Ed.2d 359 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b49-27\">The EAJA provides that, in claims against the government, \u201ca court shall <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>award to a prevailing party other than the United States fees and other expenses ... unless the court finds that the position of the United States was substantially justified.28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2412(d)(1)(A). The government does not dispute that Jager is a prevailing party. <em>See Shalala v. Schae-fer, </em>509 U.S. 292, 301, 113 S.Ct. 2625, 125 L.Ed.2d 239 (1993). The sole issue is whether the district court abused its discretion by denying fees based on its conclusion that the government\u2019s position was \u201csubstantially justified.\u201d We conclude that it did.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-4\">When assessing EAJA fee applications for cases that have been remanded because of an administrative law judge\u2019s procedural error, \u201cthe relevant question is whether the government\u2019s decision to defend on appeal the procedural errors committed by the ALJ was substantially justified.\u201d <em>Shafer v. Astrue, </em>518 F.3d 1067, 1071 (9th Cir.2008) (citing <em>Corbin v. Apfel, </em>149 F.3d 1051, 1052-53 (9th Cir.1998)). This court remanded Jager\u2019s case because of the ALJ\u2019s procedural errors, but the district court did not focus on the government\u2019s defense of those errors. Instead, the district court based its decision largely on Jager\u2019s underlying disability claim, concluding that the government\u2019s position defending the ALJ\u2019s \u201coverall\u201d decision (that Jager was not disabled) was \u201cgrounded in law and fact.\u201d Jager, however, can be a prevailing party entitled to apply for fees under the EAJA regardless of whether she ultimately succeeds in obtaining disability benefits. <em>See Shalala, </em>509 U.S. at 300-01, 113 S.Ct. 2625. The district court therefore applied an erroneous view of the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-5\">Further, in Jager\u2019s case, the government was not substantially justified in defending the ALJ\u2019s procedural errors. The defense of \u201cbasic and fundamental errors\u201d are \u201cdifficult to justify.\u201d <em>Corbin, </em>149 F.3d at 1053. The ALJ in Jager\u2019s case committed some of the same procedural errors this court held in <em>Shafer </em>to be \u201cfundamental.\u201d <em>See Shafer, </em>518 F.3d at 1072 (holding that errors such as failing to provide clear and convincing reasons for discrediting a claimant\u2019s subjective complaints, rejecting a treating physician\u2019s opinion in favor of a nontreating physician\u2019s opinion without providing clear and convincing reasons, and erring in assessing the claimant\u2019s residual functioning capacity are \u201cfundamental\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b50-7\">We therefore conclude that Jager is entitled to an award of fees under the EAJA. This matter is referred to the Appellate Commissioner to determine the amount of attorneys\u2019 fees, pursuant to Circuit Rule 39-1.9. <em>See Orn v. Astrue, </em>511 F.3d 1217, 1220 (9th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b50-8\">REVERSED and REFERRED to the Appellate Commissioner.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b49-28\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
