McWILLIAMS, Senior Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b174-22\">In a six-count indictment filed in the United States District Court for the District of Colorado, Moussa Bitar (the defendant) was charged with various identity theft charges. Defendant was thereafter represented by the Public Defender\u2019s Office. Pursuant to a plea agreement, the defendant pled guilty to Counts 2 and 6, and the Government dismissed all remain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>ing counts. In Count 2, the defendant was charged with unlawfully using a photocopy of documents purporting to be a valid Michigan Drivers License and a Texas birth certificate, both in the name of one Sergo Armado Soto, in an attempt to secure a passport in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1028A. In Count 6, the defendant was charged with falsely using a Social Security account number which was not his when applying for employment with the Professional Bureau of Collections, Inc., in violation of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 408(a)(7)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b175-5\">After a pre-sentence report was filed, the district court sentenced defendant to two years imprisonment on Count 2 and a sentence of \u201ctime served\u201d on Count 6. The defendant, through counsel, thereafter filed a timely notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-6\">As stated, at sentencing the district court sentenced defendant to \u201ctime served\u201d on Count 6, which meant that the defendant was <em>not </em>sentenced to imprisonment on Count 6 for any additional time beyond that already served by him. However, as to Count 2, the district court sentenced defendant to imprisonment for two years pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1028A(a)(l), which provides that one who uses a means of identification without lawful authority <em>shall </em>be sentenced to a term of imprisonment for two years.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-7\">On appeal, the Public Defenders Office has filed a so-called <em>Anders Brief. See Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). In that brief counsel concedes that the district court\u2019s sentence of imprisonment for two years on Count 2, which was statutorily mandated, was proper, as was his sentence of \u201ctime served\u201d on Count 6 <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Accordingly, counsel asks that we dismiss this appeal on the grounds that there is, under the circumstances described, no non-frivolous issue which could be used to challenge the sentence imposed on either Count 2 or 6. Our study of the record, as required by <em>Anders, </em>leads us to conclude that there is no non-frivolous issue which could be raised by the defendant as concerns his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-11\">Therefore, the appeal is dismissed and counsel\u2019s request to withdraw is granted.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b174-8\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed. R.App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-23\">The parties waived oral argument, and this panel has determined unanimously that oral argument would not materially assist the determination of this appeal. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 34(f); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b175-8\">. Counsel states that the defendant did not qualify under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(e) for a sentence below the statutory minimum nor did the government file a motion for such.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
