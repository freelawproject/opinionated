McKAY, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b113-5\">Dennis R. Marshall, appearing pro se, appeals the district court\u2019s affirmance of the Commissioner\u2019s denial of his claim for social security disability benefits. We have jurisdiction under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g) and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b113-7\">Mr. Marshall applied for disability insurance benefits in October 1997, stating that he was unable to work due to a left knee joint replacement, shoulder injuries, elbow problems, spinal disorders, and carpal tunnel syndrome. Because his insured status expired at the end of 1997, Mr. Marshall had to demonstrate that he was disabled during the narrow time period between October 20, 1996 and December 31, 1997. <em>See Grogan v. Barnhart, </em>399 F.3d 1257, 1261 (10th Cir.2005) (determining whether claimant showed disability before \u201cinsurance window closed\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b113-8\">Three times, an Administrative Law Judge denied Mr. Marshall\u2019s claim and three times, the Appeals Council remanded the case with instructions. After the last remand order, issued March 3, 2005, the third ALJ held another hearing at which Mr. Marshall was represented by counsel. Later, the ALJ issued the fourth order that denied benefits. The Appeals Council denied Mr. Marshall\u2019s request for review on May 11, 2006, making the fourth decision the final decision of the Commissioner. <em>See Bowman v. Astrue, </em>511 F.3d 1270, 1272 (10th Cir.2008). In the district court, Mr. Marshall\u2019s attorney challenged the ALJ\u2019s compliance with the Appeals Council\u2019s final remand order, raising the issues of whether: (1) \u201cthe ALJ\u2019s failure to evaluate the collateral source statements as the Appeals Council specifically instructed is an error that requires remand\u201d and (2) \u201cthe ALJ erred by failing to properly evaluate the treating source opinions.\u201d Aplt. R., Vol. IV, Pl.\u2019s Br. in Supp. of Pet. for Review at 3. The district court affirmed the Commissioner\u2019s decision and Mr. Marshall now appeals to this court, appearing pro se.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-11\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b113-12\">On judicial review, we construe Mr. Marshall\u2019s pro se brief \u201cliberally and [hold it] to a less stringent standard than formal pleadings drafted by lawyers.\u201d <em>Hall v. Bellmon, </em>935 F.2d 1106, 1110 (10th Cir. 1991). Nevertheless, we have \u201crepeatedly insisted that pro se parties follow the same rules of procedure that govern other litigants.\u201d <em>Garrett v. Selby Connor Maddux &amp; Janer, </em>425 F.3d 836, 840 (10th Cir.2005) (quotation omitted). Mr. Marshall\u2019s appellate arguments do not necessarily parallel the issues his attorney raised in the district court. Much of his brief is devoted to explanations of his state of mind and contentions that his physicians\u2019 comments have been misinterpreted and his physical exertions misconstrued.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-13\">To the extent that Mr. Marshall now asks this court either to view the evidence in a light more favorable to him or to address issues not brought to the district court, we must decline his invitation. It is not our province to \u201creweigh the evidence [or] substitute our judgment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>for that of the agency.\u201d <em>Bowman, </em>511 F.3d at 1272 (quotation omitted). In addition, \u201cabsent extraordinary circumstances, we do not consider arguments raised for the first time on appeal.\u201d <em>Hill v. Kan. Gas Serv. Co., </em>323 F.3d 858, 866 (10th Cir.2003) (quotation omitted). Thus, we do not address Mr. Marshall\u2019s assertions that: (1) he didn\u2019t understand the significance of an insured date; (2) defendants unfairly emphasized his physician\u2019s notes on pain medications and gave the wrong work-release date; (3) his physician erred in stating that he shoveled snow and willingly filled sand bags; (4) the ALJs and the district court viewed his activities in a biased manner; (5) his period of substantial gainful employment was wrongfully calculated; and (6) the final ALJ failed to understand that he was willing to work if physically able to do so and also neglected to consider his severe impairments in combination.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-4\">Mr. Marshall\u2019s remaining issue concerns the Commissioner\u2019s evaluation of physicians\u2019 statements on his residual functional capacity. We examine the ALJ\u2019s decision \u201cto determine whether the factual findings are supported by substantial evidence in the record and whether the correct legal standards were applied.\u201d <em>Bowman, </em>511 F.3d at 1272 (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b114-5\">Mr. Marshall submitted several medical source statements to support his disability claims. Dr. Trey O\u2019Neal examined Mr. Marshall on March 6, 2004, and determined that his left-knee pain was a \u201crather significant functioning limiting issue,\u201d that his back pain would make \u201cany activities requiring prolonged sitting difficult,\u201d and that his right-shoulder pain would limit overhead lifting. Admin. R., Vol. Ill, at 596-97. Similarly, Dr. Shane Gagon, who had treated Mr. Marshall for pain since January 2001, provided statements in February and May of 2004. Dr. Gagon opined that Mr. Marshall\u2019s pain severely restricted his ability to sit and stand during a normal working day, required him to take frequent breaks and be absent from work more than four times a month, and prevented him from concentrating, tolerating stress, or making decisions. <em>Id. </em>at 584-88, 599-600. In June 2005, Dr. David Heiner, Mr. Marshall\u2019s orthopedic surgeon, described Mr. Marshall as needing a job which would allow him to shift positions at will and to take unscheduled breaks every half hour. Noting that this opinion was based on the \u201cpatient[\u2019s] account,\u201d Dr. Heiner did not provide an onset date. <em>Id. </em>at 697-700.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-7\">The ALJ discussed each of the medical opinions in her decision and noted that Drs. Heiner and Gagon were treating physicians. She accorded the opinions little weight, however, because the statements were provided years after the critical date of December 31,1997. As for Dr. Heiner\u2019s opinion, the ALJ also observed that Dr. Heiner\u2019s \u201cown notes do not support the determination that the claimant became disabled prior to the date he last became insured for disability insurance benefits.\u201d <em>Id., </em>Vol. II, at 34. And the ALJ found that, though Dr. Gagon diagnosed Mr. Marshall with fibromyalgia in 2004, this \u201cwas not a medically determinable impairment\u201d during the relevant time. <em>Id. </em>at 30.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-8\">An ALJ has an obligation to determine whether a treating physician\u2019s opinion is entitled to controlling weight or, if not, whether it is entitled to some lesser weight or none at all. <em>Watkins v. Barnhart, </em>350 F.3d 1297, 1300-01 (10th Cir.2003). The ALJ\u2019s decision \u201cmust be sufficiently specific to make clear to any subsequent reviewers the weight the adjudicator gave to the treating source\u2019s medical opinion and the reasons for that weight.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted). The goal is to facilitate meaningful review. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b115-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>The task of determining Mr. Marshall\u2019s condition prior to his last insured date was made more difficult by the repeated remands and resulting delays. Mr. Marshall\u2019s frustration with the process is certainly understandable. Nevertheless, his claim was given careful consideration: the ALJ provided good reasons for discounting the medical opinions that were reached years after the period in question. We now conclude that the Commissioner\u2019s final decision followed appropriate legal standards and was supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-5\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED. Mr. Marshall\u2019s motion to proceed in forma pauperis is GRANTED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b113-9\"> After examining the briefs and appellate record, this panel has determined unanimously that oral argument would not materially assist the determination of this appeal. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument. This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed. R.App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
