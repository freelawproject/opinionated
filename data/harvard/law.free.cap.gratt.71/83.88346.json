And he directs that a certain sum shall be paid to a child who shall marry and thus cease to be supported out of the profits of the estate.

Three of the children were by a former wife, who had inherited one-third of Seguine. G bought the other two-thirds, lived upon it, and during the first wife\u2019s life, expended some 80,000 in improvements upon it. In 1801, the Confederate government impressed the timber standing on 289 acres of Seguine, and G having received payment for it, he, with that money and some of his own, bought two tracts of land which he owned at his death, and which passed under his will\u2014 Held :</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b103-13\">1.

Gates, of Chesterfield county, died in 1868, leaving a widow and five infant children surviving him. Of these children three were by a former wife. He left a will which was duly admitted to probate in the county court of Chesterfield, and Kobert G. Bass qualified as his executor. In the second clause of his will he saj\u2019s: \u201cI wish my estate kept together, and managed by my executors as if I were living, for the joint benefit and common good of my wife, Bettie Gates, and my children, Blanch C., Lillie W., Judith IT., Maria T., and William Beverly Gatos, so long as my widow remains unmarried. Should my executors, however, at any time believe that it would be to the interest and benefit of my wife and children to sell any part of the real and personal estate, they are hereby invested with full power to sell and convey any portion thereof, except the homestead known as Seguine, and the mills and appurtenances thereto attached.\u201d And he directed that all the income and profits of his estate should be used, if necessary, for the common support, maintenance and education of his children. And he directed that if any of his children should marry before a general division of the estate, thereby withdrawing from her support from the general income of the estate, such child should receive $1,000 within ninety days after'the marriage, and $1,000 in five years thereafter, to be accounted for, without interest, on a final division of the estate.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b104-11\">In a subsequent clause he says: \u201cIf, however, my widow shall at any time marry again', thereby making it necessary for a general division of my- estate, my will and desire is, that after taking her thirds, the balance of my estate shall be equally divided between my children, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>each accounting for what money they may have drawn from the estate. I further will and desire that no general division of my estate shall take place until my youngest (then living) child shall attain the age of twenty years, or at the death of my widow, or in the event of her marriage again.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b105-4\">The widow of \"William B. Gates renounced the provision made for her by his will, and she, on her own behalf and as next friend of her two infant children, instituted a suit in equity against the executor and the other children. In the bill the real estate left by William B. Gates is set out, and the prayer of the bill is for a settlement of the accounts of the executor, that dower may be assigned to her; that the will may be construed; that a sale of the real estate, except that called Seguine, may be made, and Seguine may be kept together, &amp;c., &amp;c.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b105-5\">The three children by the first marriage, and Bass, the executor, answered; a commissioner was directed to take the account and make enquiry; which was done; and one of-the defendants having married J. M. Gregory, and another John O. Goode, they filed a cross-bill in the cause.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b105-6\">The questions of controversy in the cause, were, first, whether the widow having renounced the will, that authorized a division of the estate, she not having married and the youngest child not having attained the age of twenty years. Second, whether there was a case of election on the part of the three children of the first marriage. It appears that the place called Seguine had been the property of Thomas Belcher, who died intestate, and that it descended to his three children, of whom the first Mrs. Gates was one; and that William B. Gates purchased the shares of the other two. He lived upon the place, and during his first wife\u2019s life remodeled the dwelling-house, rebuilt the mill upon it, and added a saw-mill, all at an expense of |9,492.20. The third <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>question was as to the liability of William 13. .Gates\u2019 estate for wood cut off the Seguine land. It appears in 1864, the Confederate government, through an agent, proposed to Gates to purchase the wood standing on a part of the land, but he refused to sell it. It was then impressed by the government,' and the price at which it was to be. taken being agreed, Gates received $48,167 in Confederate treasury notes, and $24,083 in Confederate bonds. He added of his own money to the treasury notes enough to make the sum of $60,000, with which he purchased two farms in the county of Chesterfield, one named Archer and the other Winfree, which constituted a part of his estate when he died. The bonds perished on his hands. It appears further that much of the timber cut and sawmd by the Confederate government, was on the ground when the Confederacy failed, arid that the United States government seized it and converted it to their owm use. They also seized the timber yet standing on the two hundred and eighty-nine acres which had been impressed, and it was sold for $675. The commissioner estimates the damage done to the Seguine farm by the cutting and removal, of timber at $600, of which one-third is $200.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b106-6\">The turn causes came on to be heard on the 20th of May, 1873, wdien the court held that the testator AVilliam 13. Gates disposed of the farm known as Seguine, by his' will, and thereby put his children, Blanch C., Lillie W., and Judith IT. Gates, to their election, either to confirm the will as to its disposition of the one-third of Seguine, or to claim against the -will; and in the latter event they were to compensate the other two children out of the property deivsed to them by the will for wdiat they would lose by said election to claim against the will, And it was further held that the said three elder children could not follow' the fund derived from the wood which w'as invested in the Chesterfield lands, and that they wore <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>not entitled to <em>a </em>division of the estate at that time; no one of the contingencies indicated by the testator as making a general division of the estate necessary, having occurred. And the parties all agreeing that the shares of the said three eldest children in the estate of their father under his will were much more than the one-third of Seguiue, an enquiry on that question was waived by them, but their waiver was to be without prejudice to their defence against the plaintiffe\u2019 claim of election. From this decree Gregory and wife, Goode and wife, and Judith F. Gates, applied to a judge of this court for an appeal; which was allowed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b107-4\"><em>McRae </em>and <em>Christian, </em>for the appellants.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b107-5\"><em>Guy $ Gilliam, </em>for the appellees.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b107-6\">Christian, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"ATM\">delivered the opinion of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-7\">The court is of opinion that there is no error in the decree of the circuit court in declaring that the appellants \u201care not entitled to a general division of the estate of the testator at this time.\u201d The will of the testator contains the following provision: \u201c I further will and desire that no general division of my estate shall take place until my youngest (then living) child, shall attain the age of twenty years, or at the death of my widow, or in the event of her marriage again.\u201d isone of these contingencies, upon the happening of -which the testator indicated as the period when a general division of his estate should be made, or become necessary and proper, have yet occurred. Until at least one of these events happen, no general division of his estate can be made.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-8\">The court is further of opinion that there is no error in said decree so far as it declares that the appellants, \u201cBlanch C., Lillie W., and Judith E. Gates, cannot fol<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>low the fund which they claim in their cross-bill was invested in the Archer and Winfree tracts of land by testator in his life time.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AssJ\">The claim asserted by these three appellants, is, that they being entitled to one-third in fee, of the farm mentioned in the will known as Seguine, and that the farms known as the Archer and Winfree tracts, being purchased by the testator with the proceeds of the sale' of timber from the Seguine farm, that they have an interest in the said Archer and Winfree tracts to the extent of, one-third of the purchase money. The title to these two last named tracts was in the testator, and disposed of by him in his will, and these appellants cannot claim both under the will, and at the same time claim title to those two tracts of land, but would be put to their election. This would be manifestly to their great disadvantage, as, according to the report of the commissioner, their interest in the timber cut oft' the farm, Seguine, would be only the sum of about $200. But it is shown by the record that the piermanent improvements put on the farm known as Seguine, by the testator in his lifetime (one-third of which farm is the property of these appellants), far exceed in value the timber which was sold by the testator; these permanent improvements being estimated by the commissioner to whom the matter was referred, at upwards of nine thousand dollars. The court is therefore of opinion that there is no error in the decree of said circuit court in rejecting the claim set up by the appellants in their cross-bill.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-5\">But the court is further of opinion that the decree of the said circuit court is erroneous, so far as it declares that \u201c the testator, W. B. Gates, disposed of the farm known as Seguine, by his will, and thereby put his children, Blanch C., Lillie W., and Judith F. Gates, to an election, either to confirm the will as to its disposition of one-third of Seguine, or to claim against the will, and in the latter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>event they are to compensate out of the property devised to them, from the said testator\u2019s will, the other two children, Maria T., and William Beverly Gates, for what they (the said Maria T., and William Beverly Gates) would lose by said election to claim against the will.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b109-4\">This decree, in effect, declares that the testator (though entitled to but two-thirds of the farm known as Seguine\u2014the appellants before named being entitled to one-third) had by his will disposed of <em>the whole of </em>it, instead of only that portion (two-thirds) to which he had title.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-5\">The clause of the will upon which this decree is founded is as follows: \u201c Secondly, I wish my estate kept together and managed by my executors (hereinbefore named), as if I were living, to be used for the joint benefit and common good of my wife, Bettie Gates, and my children, Blanch C., Lillie W., Judith F., Maria T., and William Beverly Gates, so long as my widow remains unmarried. Should my executors, however, at any time believe that it would be to the interest and benefit of my wife and children to sell any part of the real or personal estate, they are hereby invested with full power to sell and convey any portion thereof, except the homestead known as Seguine, and the mills and appurtenances thereto attached.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b109-6\">The question to be determined is, whether by this clause (which is the only one referring to Seguine), the three oldest children of the testator, who own, as the record shows, one-third of Seguine, are put to an election ?</p>\n<p id=\"b109-7\">The doctrine of election may be thus stated: That he who accepts a benefit under a deed or will, must adopt the whole contents of the instrument, conforming to all its provisions, and renouncing every right inconsistent with it. If, therefore, a testator has affected to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>dispose of property which is not his own, and has given a benefit to the person to whom that property belongs, the devisee or legatee accepting the benefit so given to him must make good the testator\u2019s attempted disposition; but if, on the contrary, he choose to enforce his proprietary rights against the testator\u2019s disposition, equity will sequester the property given to him, for the purpose of making satisfaction out of it to the person whom he has disappointed by the assertion of those rights. 1 Jai\u2019man on Wills, 384 (marg.), and cases there cited. And it is immaterial whether the testator, in disposing of that which is not his own, is aware of his want of title, or proceeds upon the erroneous supposition that he is exercising a power of disposition which belongs to him; in either case, whoever claims in opposition to the will must relinquish what the will gives him. Ib. 387.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-9\">But in order to raise a case of election, there must appear in the will itself a clear intention on the part of the testator to dispose of that which is not his own. See 1st Lead. Cas. Eq. <em>(Noys </em>v. Mordaunt); Hare &amp; Wallace\u2019s Notes, p. 284 (marg.), and numerous cases there cited. As was said by Lord <em>Eldon, </em>in <em>Rancliffe </em>v. <em>Parkyan, </em>6 Dow, P. C. 149: <em>\u201cPrima facie </em>it is'not to be supposed that a testator disposes of that which is not his own. It must be by demonstration plain, by necessary implication, meaning by that the utter improbability, that he could have meant otherwise, that the case (of election) is raised. It rests upon those contending for a case of election, to show that there is that manifest, plain demonstration and utter improbability.\u201d- lie further says (p. 185): \u201cIt is difficult in any case to apply the doctrine of election, where the testator has some present interest in the estate disposed of,.though it may not be entirely his own.\u201d See also <em>Higginbotham </em>v. <em>Cornwell, </em>8 Gratt. 83; and <em>Dixon </em>v. <em>Mc Cue, </em>14 Gratt. 540. These last were eases as to the necessity of a widow electing between her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>right of dower and the provisions of her husband\u2019s will; but the principles therein declared are the same as those which govern the case before us. In the first case Judge <em>Baldwin, </em>delivering the opinion of the court, says: \u201c The conclusion against the claim of the widow ought to be as satisfactory as if it were expressed.\u201d In the latter case, Judge <em>Daniel, </em>after commenting on the former case, and remarking that Judge <em>Baldwin </em>had stated the doctrine somewhat too strongly, says: \u201cI think it fairly results from the authorities, that wherever the inference against the widow\u2019s right is clear beyond reasonable doubt\u2014wherever the implications against her are so strong that to defeat them resort must be had \u25a0 to a forced, far-fetched or unreasonable construction of the will, a case is made to put her to her election.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b111-4\">Applying these principles to the will before us, it is plain that no case of election is raised. Here the testator had an interest to the extent of two-thirds in the farm known as Seguine. There is nothing on the face of the will, taking all its provisions, and construing it as a whole, which indicates clearly or by necessary implication, that the testator intended to dispose of any part of Seguine not his own, or that his disposition as to Seguine was not confined to the two-thirds which he owned in fee simple.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-5\">It is to be particularly noticed that the testator nowhere in his will disposes of Seguine <em>specifically. </em>If disposed of at all it is by <em>general </em>words. Indeed, Seguine is not mentioned in the will at all, except in the sec\u00f3n d clause, in which the testator empowers his executors (if to the interest of his wife and children), to sell and convey any portion of the real and personal estate, \u201c except the homestead known as Seguine.\u201d It cannot be said, upon any fair construction or necessaiy implication, that the testator, in using this language, or in directing a general division of his whole estate upon the death or marriage <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>of his widow, or the arrival at the age of twenty years-of his youngest child, disposed of that part of Seguine which was not his own, but which belonged to his children. Indeed, it may be fairly presumed that the very consideration which influenced the testator to \u201c except the homestead known as Seguine\u201d from the sale by his executors, was the fact that he knew that he was the owner of but two-thirds, while his children were the owners of the remaining third, At any rate, it is clear that no such plain and unequivocal intention on the part of the testator to give away that which is not his own is indicated, as constitutes, under all the authorities, a case of election.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-9\">In <em>Miller </em>v. <em>Thrugood, </em>33 Beavan, reported also in 42 <em>Law Journal, </em>1864, Eq. p. 511, the doctrines on the subject of election are stated in language which has peculiar force in application to the case before us. Sir <em>John Romilly </em>says: \u201cThe eases upon the subject of election resolve themselves into this: If the testator has a partial interest in the particular property, and he disposes of the <em>whole specifically, </em>and then gives the owner of the other portion some interest under the will, a question of election arises, and the owner of the other portion must elect to take under or against the will. But if the testator does not dispose of the property specifically\u2014if he uses <em>general </em>words, then no question of election arises, as the language he employs applies to his own interest in the property,, and does not imply an intention to dispose of any other property than his own. These principles are to be collected from the cases.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b112-10\">In the will before us there are no words disposing of Seguine specifically, but only general words disposing of the testator\u2019s whole estate at a certain period, the only mention of Seguine being to except it from the provision of the will empowering his executors to sell his real estate, and that \u201c exception \u201d is entirely consistent with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>the intention of the testator to dispose of the interest <em>only </em>which he had in the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-4\">The court is therefore Of opinion that the decree of the said circuit court, so far as it puts the appellants to an election, be reversed, and in all other respects be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-10\">The decree was as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b113-11\">The court is of opinion, for reasons stated in writing and filed with the record, that the said decree of the said circuit court, so far as it declares that \u201cthe testator, W. 13. Gates, disposed of the farm known as Seguine by his will, and thereby put his children, Blanch C., Lillie <em>~W., </em>and Judith F. Gates, to an election, either to confirm the will as to one-tliird of Seguine, or to claim against the will,\u201d is erroneous. It is therefore decreed and ordered that the said decree to this extent, be reversed and annulled, but in all other respects affirmed; and that the appellants recover against the appellees their costs by them expended in the prosecution of their appeal and <em>supersedeas </em>here. And this court now proceeding to render such decree as the said circuit court ought to have entered, it is adjudged, ordered and decreed, as the opinion of this court, that the testator, <em>W. </em>B. Gates, did not dispose of the whole of the farm known as Seguine, but only the two-thirds thereof to which he had title; and that, therefore, the appellants, Blanch 0., Lillie \"W\\, and Judith F. Gates, were not put to an election, either to confirm the will as to its disposition of one-third of Seguine, or to claim against the will, as declared by the decree of the circuit court of Chesterfield.. All of which is ordered to be certified to said circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-12\">Decree reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
