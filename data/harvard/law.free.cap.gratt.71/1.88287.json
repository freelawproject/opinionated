In an action by an execution creditor against the sheriff and his sureties upon his official bond, for the failure to pay over the money he had collected on the execution which had gone into the hands of one of his deputies, the declaration not stating that the plaintiff did not reside in the county of the sheriff, it is not necessary to aver that a demand had been made upon the sheriff, as prescribed by the statute, before the action was instituted.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b21-10\">2. If it appears upon the trial that the plaintiff' in the execution did not reside in the same county with the sheriff, then unless the plaintiff proves that such demand was made on the sheriff, his action must fail.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b21-12\">3. A sheriff or other officer has no authority to receive payment under an execution after the return day thereof, unless the execution has been previously levied. Such payment would not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"2\">*2</page-number>bincl the creditor; nor would it impose any liability upon the sureties of the sheriff in his official bond. Although the sheriff may be responsible in his private capacity for money so received, no responsibility would attach to him in his official character, on that account,</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b22-5\">4- The act of 1S49, Code of 1873, cli. 184, \u00a7\u00a7 3, 4, though it gives to- <em>&amp; fieri facias </em>the effect of a continuing liqn after the return day, upon all the personal estate of the execution debtor (except as therein stated), does not enlarge the powers of the sheriff with respect to executions, and were not so intended. They siuqffy extend the lien for the benefit of the creditor.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b22-6\">5. The authority of an officer to collect money in discharge of an execution does not result from the lien, but is a consequence of the right to levy and sell the debtor\u2019s property under the execution. So long as the right to sell continues, the right to receive remains; but no longer.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b22-7\">6. If the officer levies before the return day of the writ, he may sell after the return day has passed; and as a necessary consequence he may receive payment without selling. But if he fails to levy before the return day, his authority to sell after-wards ceases, and with it the right to receive payment in discharge of the writ. He may receive payment at any time before the return day without a levy.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b22-8\">7. A count in a declaration in an .action by an execution creditor' against the sheriff and his sureties, avers that the execution went into the hands of a deputy of the sheriff, and became a lien on all the personal property of the debtor, and that the deputy collected the whole amount of the execution; but does not aver that the execution vAras levied,\u2019or that the money was paid before the return day of the writ. The count is fatally defective.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b22-9\">8. Although a sheriff is liable to a flue, at the discretion of the proper court, for his failure to make due return of an execution, he is also liable to an action on his official bond by the party injured by his failure. The fine is in the nature of punishment for a personal offence, and is not considered as any satisfaction for the damage sustained by the creditor in being unjustly kept out of his money by the default of the sheriff or his deputy.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b22-10\">9. When the fine is paid by the sureties of the sheriff, in any subsequent proceeding against them on the judgment or decree'upon which the execution issued, they will be entitled to a credit on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"3\">*3</page-number>the Judgment or decree for the amount of the fine or fines so paid. Code of 1S73, oh. 49, \u00a728.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b23-4\">10. In an action by an execution creditor against the sheriff and his sureties, one count in tin* declaration, after stating that said execution was in the hands of the deputy, and was returnable on a date stated, avers that neither the deputy sheriff or the said sheriff of S. county made such return since that time, but such return of said execution to make, have wholly neglected and refused, &amp;c. The count is substantially sufficient.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b23-5\">11. In an action by E, the execution creditor of K <em>&amp; </em>B, against the sheriff and his surviving sureties, for a failure to pay over money collected on the execution, the plaintiff offered B as a witness, stating that he, E, expected, among other things, to prove by this witness payment of money to said sheriff or his deputy on the execution of E against K <em>&amp; </em>B\u2014Held : B was not so directly interested in tlie result of the suit, or in the verdict and judgment to be rendered, as to render him incompetent to testify in the cause.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b23-6\">12. B having stated that there were sundry executions against Iv &amp; B; that the sheriff and his deputies had been at their place of business, and made levies of executions, but he could not say whether or not the execution in this case was ever levied by the sheriff or any of his deputies, the plaintiffs then propounded the following question : Did you make any payments on this execution to the sheriff or his deputies either before or after the return day of this execution; if so, when; to whom, and how much? To this question witness said: \u201c I made a payment on the 3d of April, 18G2, of $300, according to this receipt: Eeceived April 3d, 1862, of James M. Bradford, \u00a3500, in part of claims in my hands. J. G., S. S. C., 6. G., D. S.\u201d\u2014Held : This testimony was clearly admissible at that stage of the trial to prove the payment, because the plaintiffs might adduce, evidence tending to show the levy before the return day of the execution. If they faile.d to do so it was competent for the defendants to move to exclude all that the witness said with respect to the payment made by him.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b23-7\">13. The payment made to the deputy G was intended to be handed by him to M, another deputy, who had the execution. A few days after the payment B saw !M, and he directed M to apply the same to the execution of E, to which M made no objection (no reply)\u2014Held : This evidence was properly left to the jury to determine whether the officer had acquiesced in the direction of the debtor, and whether, under the circumstances, the officer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>could properly apply any part of the money to other claims in his hands against the debtor.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b24-7\">14. In an action by an execution creditor against the sheriff and his surviving sureties in his official bond to recover damages for the failure of the sheriff and his deputies to levy and make due return of the execution, or to pay over money collected under the execution, it appeared that the execution went into the hands of the deputy M, and it was his conduct that was involved in the case. The. defendants offered M as a witness on their behalf, and he was objected to by the plaintiffs, on the ground that some of the sureties of the sheriff were dead, and the witness was interested in the result of the suit, arising out of his liability over to his principal\u2014Held: The transaction which was the subject of investigation in the case was the alleged default of the deputy sheriff. All the parties to that transaction'were living and competent to testify in the cause. The sureties of the sheriff, though liable on their bond for the default of the sheriff and his deputies, were no parties to the transaction which was the subject of investigation. M was, therefore, a competent witness.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b24-8\">15. After all the evidence was introduced the sheriff and the deputy M asked to be allowed to withdraw and make a return on the execution of B against K &amp; B, a copy being left of said execution, it being then in evidence, stating that as soon as returned to the county court clerk\u2019s office (from whence it was issued) they would offer said return in evidence\u2014Held : It was not error to refuse the application.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b24-9\">16. When the creditor proceeds against the sheriff for money collected under an execution, the demand of payment in the sheriff\u2019s county is absolutely essential if the parties reside in different counties. But when the creditor is also suing for a failure to make due return of an execution, no demand is necessary previous to a judgment for such breach. The gist of the action is the failure to return the execution.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b24-10\">This case was heard in Staunton, hut was decided in Richmond. It was an action of debt brought in the county court of Shenandoah in September, 1871, but afterwards transferred to the circuit court of that county, in the name of the Commonwealth. of Virginia, suing at the costs, &amp;c., of Ridgely, Hampton &amp; Co., against John J. Grandstaff, late sheriff of Shenandoah county, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>and the surviving sureties in his official bond. The declaration contained five counts. The first set out the official bond, and the qualification of said Grandstaff, and the entry upon his office of sheriff on the first of January, 1859, which continued for two years; and that the plaintiffs had recovered a judgment in the county court of the county in 1860 against David McKay and James M. Bradford, partners, for $556.53 with interest, &amp;c., and costs; that on the 21st of March, 1860, they had sued out an execution of <em>fieri facias </em>on said judgment, which on the same day was delivered to George J. Grandstaff', deputy of the said John J. Grandstaff', sheriff, &amp;c., and that on the 23d of April George .J. Grandstaff made endorsement thereon: \u201cDeceived April 23d, 1860, at 11 o\u2019clock A. M,\u201d as required by law; whereby and by reason whereof the said execution became a lien from said date upon all the personal estate of, or to which said judgment debtors were possessed or entitled (although not levied on nor capable of being levied on), except such personal estate of said judgment debtors as was exempt by law from distress or levy, which said lien has never ceased or been suspended by a forthcoming bond being given and forfeited, or by a <em>supersedeas </em>or other process up to the time of the institution of this suit. And the said plaintiff's aver that afterwards, to-wit: On the 23d of April, 1860, the said execution was delivered by said George J. Grand-staff, deputy sheriff for John J. Grandstaff\u2019, toB. B. Murray, another deputy of said John J. Grandstaff, sheriff of Shenandoah county, and held by him as such deputy from that time until the institution of this suit. And the plaintiffs further aver that at said time, to-wit: on the 23d of April, 1860, at the county aforesaid, and from that time until the institution of this suit, said defendants had large personal estate over and above such as was exempt by law, more than enough to have paid said execution of plaintiffs, upon w\u2019hich said execution, by virtue of said en<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>dorsement, became a lien; and the plaintiffs aver that while said execution was so in the hands of said last-deputy sheriff, and a lien upon said personal estate of said defendants, the said defendants, to-wit: on the-day of-, 18(1\u2014, paid'to the said last-mentioned deputy sheriff the whole amount of said execution in money, in satisfaction and discharge thereof; which sa^ mone7 so paid, the said deputy sheriff aforesaid to pay to the said plaintiffs, or either of them or their authorized agents or attorneys, wholly neglected and refused; to the damage, &amp;c.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b26-8\">The second count charged the failure by the sheriff and his deputies to'levy the execution. The third count charged the levy of the execution, but the failure to sell the property or collect the money; and the fourth count charged the levy of the execution and the collection of the money, and the failure to pay it to the plaintiffs.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"Ag\">The fifth count followed the first down to and including the averment that the debtors in the execution had large personal estate\u2014more than enough to have paid said execution to the plaintiffs, and then proceeded: And the plaintiffs aver that although said execution was so in the hands of said deputy sheriffs, and they were required by law and by the terms thereof to make return thereof, and to have said money mentioned therein before the justices of the county court of Shenandoah county aforesaid on the Monday before the second Tuesday in May next, after the date thereof, to-wit, i860, to render to the plaintiffs of the debt and costs aforesaid; yet neither the said deputy sheriffs, or either of them, or the said sheriff of Shenandoah county, made such returns of said executions on said return day, nor have they, or either of them, made such return since that time, but such return of said execution to make have wholly neglected and refused, and still do, &amp;c.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b26-11\">The defendants plead \u201c conditions performed,\u201d and <em>non </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number><em>damnificatus; </em>on which pleas issueswere joined. And they afterwards demurred to the declaration and each count thereof; but the court overruled the demurrer.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b27-4\">On the trial of the case the jury found a verdict in favor of the plaintiffs for five hundred dollars, and the defendants moved the court for a new trial, which motion the court overruled, and rendered judgment on the verdict. To which the defendants excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b27-5\">In the progress of the trial the defendants took ten bills of exception to rulings of the court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b27-6\">The first is as follows: To prove the issue on their part the plaintiffs called James M. Bradford, who being examined on his <em>voir dire, </em>stated he was a member of the firm of McKay &amp; Bradford, and one of the judgment debtors in the suit of <em>Ridgely, Hampton f Co. </em>v. <em>McKay </em>if <em>Bradford; </em>and the plaintiffs stated that they expected, among other things, to prove by this witness payments of money to said Grandstaff, or his deputy, on the execution of said <em>Ridgely, Hampton f Co. </em>v. <em>McKay Bradford. </em>To the said Bradford\u2019s being examined as a witness, the defendants objected on the ground of interest, and for other reasons (it being proved that several of the sureties in the official bond of the sheriff were dead). But the court overruled said objection, and held that said witness was competent, and allowed the said witness to be examined. His evidence is set out in exception Ho. 10, which is made a part hereof. To which ruling of the court the defendants excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b27-9\">The second exception states that the witness, Bradford, proved, among other things, that there were sundry executions against McKay &amp; Bradford, of which firm he was a member; that the sheriff and his deputies had been at their place of business, and made levies of executions; hut he could not and would not say wThether or not the execution in this case ivas ever levied by the sheriff' or any of his deputies. And the plaintiffs then propounded <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>the following question: Did you make any payments on this execution to the sheriff or his deputies, either before after the return day of the execution ? If so, when, to whom, and how much ?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AF\">To this question the defendants objected, on the ground that the sheriff could not receive money on a <em>fi. fa., </em>so as to bind his sureties in his official bond, after its return daH unless a levy was made, and for other reasons. But the court overruled the said objection, and allowed the witness to answer; and his answer was: \u201cI made a payment on the 8d of April, 1862, as per receipt I hold in my hand, of five hundred dollars, which receipt is as follows: Received April 3d, 1862, of James M. Bradford, five hundred dollars, in part of claims in my hands against him. John J. Grandstaff, S. 8. C., Geo. J. Grand-staff, D. 8. And the witness was also examined at great length in reference to said payment and receipt. The ruling of the court on the said question and admitting said answer was excepted to by the defendants.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b28-7\">Third exception. After the plaintiffs had introduced the said receipt they asked the witness on what debt he paid the said $500; to which the defendants objected. But the court overruled the objection, and allowed the witness to answer the question; and witness said that at the time of payment he said little, but a few days later, in a conversation with B. B. Murray, another deputy of said John J. Grandstaff, sheriff, to whom the execution and the money had been transferred by the deputy, George J. Grandstaff, and who then held the same, he directed the application of the same to the execution of Ridgely, Hampton &amp; Co., and to which the said Murray made no objection (no reply). To which answer the defendants objected, and asked to have the said answer excluded. But the court overruled the motion; and the defendants excepted to the admission of both the question and the answer.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b29-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>It is unnecessary to state the fourth exception. Fifth exception. The defendants,-to prove the issue on their part, offered B. F. Murray as a witness, on the <em>voir dire, </em>said he was deputy sheriff of John J. Grandstaff from .January, 1859, to 1861, but had executed no bond, and had the execution in question such deputy, and as such had received of George J. Grandstaff, the other deputy, the $500 paid by Bradford on the 3d of April, 1862, as per receipt copied in the second exception. And thereupon the plaintiffs objected to the introduction and examination of said Murray, on the ground of interest in the result of the suit arising out of liability over to' his principal, and that the plaintiffs could not be witnesses because of the death of sundry of the sureties of John J. Grandstaff, sheriff of Shenandoah county, and defendant in this suit, and for other reasons. And the court sustained the objection; and the defendants excepted. Grandstaff then executed a release to Murray and George J. Grandstaff, from all liability on account of any acts of theirs done in connection with the execution of the plaintiffs against McKay &amp; Bradford; and the defedants again offered Murray as a witness, when the court again refused to allow him to be examined. To which the defendants again excepted, and embraced both rulings in one bill of exception.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b29-7\">Sixth exception omitted as unnecessary.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b29-8\">Seventh exception. After all the evidence of plaintiffs and defendants, except that of P. Hoshour, had been offered, and when the case was closed upon the evidence, except the returns proposed to be offered and the evidence of said Hoshour, the sheriff', John J. Grandstaff, and the deputy, B. F. Murray, asked to be allowed to withdraw and make a return on the said execution of Ridgely, Hampton &amp; Go. <em>v. </em>McKay &amp; Bradford, leaving a copy of said execution, it being then in evidence, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>stating that as soon as returned to the county court clerk\u2019s office they would offer the said return in evidence, the said Bradford still being in the court-room. But the court refused to allow said execution to he withdrawn, or any return to be written on the same (the defendants stating their return would be \u201cno property found on which to levy this execution, all the property of McKay &amp; Bradford, and each of them, being covered by prior liens to its full value.\u201d) And the defendants again excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b30-9\">Eighth exception omitted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AcL\">Ninth exception. After all the evidence had been introduced the plaintiffs moved the court to give to the jury four instructions, of which the first three are as follows: Eirst. If the jury believe from the evidence that the defendant, John J. Grandstaff', late sheriff:\u2019 of Shenandoah county, either by himself or deputy, or deputies, was guilty of the breaches alleged in the plaintiff's\u2019 declaration, then they must find for the plaintiff's and assess such damages as will compensate the plaintiffs in said execution for any injury they have sustained in consequence of such breaches.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"ALh\">Second. If the jury believe from the evidence that the execution described in the declaration in this suit was received on the 23d of April, 1860, by George J. Grand-staff, one of the deputies of the defendant, John J. Grand-staff, then sheriff of Shenandoah county; that said execution subsequently passed into the hands of Benjamin E. Murray, another deputy of said John J. Grandstaff\u2019, sheriff as aforesaid; that James M. Bradford, one of the defendants in said execution, on the 3d of April,. 1862, paid to said George J. Grandstaff', deputy as aforesaid, the sum of $500 in Confederate money, for which the said George J. Grandstaff gave to said Bradford a receipt in the words and figures following: Received April 3d, 1862, of James M. Bradford, five hundred dollars in part <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>of claims in my hands against him. John J. Grandstaff, S. S. C., George J. Grandstaff, D. S., and requested the said George J. Grandstaff\u2019 to pay the same to the said Benj amin F. Murray, the other deputy; that the money on the same day was so paid to said Murray; thatin about three weeks thereafter the said Bradford requested said Murray to apply said money to the execution of Bidgely, Hampton &amp; Co. <em>v. </em>McKay &amp; Bradford, stating that it would nearly pay the principal of said execution, and that he did not wish to divide it, to which said Murray made no objection; and that neither the said John J. Grandstaif, shei\u2019iff as aforesaid, nor either of his said deputies, has paid the same or any part thereof to said Bidgely, Hampton &amp; Co., or to their attorney or attorneys, they must find for the plaintiffs in this suit; and in assessing the damages for the breaches assigned in the declaration, must take into consideration the said sum of $500, paid .as aforesaid by said Bradford to said Geoi\u2019ge J. Grandstaff\u2019, and by him to the said Benjamin F. Murray, deputies as aforesaid, and allow such damages as will be equivalent to the value of the same at the time it ought to have been paid by the said sheriff\u2019, or his deputies to the said Bidgely, Hampton &amp; Co., or to their attorney or attorneys, less the sheriff\u2019s commission and the sheriff\u2019s and clerk\u2019s fees in said execution.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b31-4\">Third. That it was the duty of the shei\u2019iff (Grandstaff), either in person or by deputy, to levy the execution of the plaintiff\u2019s upon the personal pi'operty of the partnei\u2019ship of McKay &amp; Bradford, if any, and sell the same subject to older executions, if any, previously levied on the same and unsatisfied.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b31-5\">The defendants asked for nine instructions. The first and second were given by the court. The fourth and sixth are omitted as unnecessary.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b31-6\">Third. That in order to hold the defendants responsible for any money paid by McKay &amp; Bradford, or either <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>of them, on the execution in question, the jury must find either that the execution against McKay &amp; Bradford was levied, or that the money was paid before the return day of the execution.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b32-9\">Fifth. That no officer receiving money under an exe cution, when the party to whom it is payable resides in a different county from that in which the officer resides, is liable to have any judgment rendered against him and his sureties, for the non-payment thereof, until a demand of payment be made of such officer in his county, by such creditor, or his attorney-at-law, or some one having the written order of said creditor; and if the jury believe that plaintiffs reside out of this county, and no demand for the same is established by the evidence in this case, they must find for the defendants as to said money so paid, should they find any was so paid.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b32-10\">Seventh. The jury are instructed that if they believe from the evidence, that the receipt to James M. Bradford for the $500 paid April 3d, 1862, which purports to be signed by John J. Grandstaff', in his official capacity as sheriff of Shenandoah county, was made by George J. \u2022Grandstaff, after the expiration of his term of office as deputy for John J. Grandstaff, sheriff\u2019 as aforesaid, and when he did not have the execution of Ridgelv, Hampton &amp; Go. <em>v. </em>McKay &amp; Bradford in his hands, then such payment to him was invalid, and the said George J. Grandstaff' had no power to bind the said sheriff and his sureties by receiving the same and executing the receipt aforesaid.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b32-11\">Eighth. If the jury believe from the evidence that the payment of $500 made April 3d, 1862, was intended to be and was actually paid into the hands of B. F. Murray, who was then sheriff of Shenandoah county, and had sundry executions against James M. Bradford, and the firm of McKay &amp; Bradford, which executions had originally come into his hands as deputy for John J. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>Grandstaff, and which he continued to hold after he qualified as sheriff as aforesaid, that the said Murray, as sheriff aforesaid, and his sureties, are responsible said sum of money, and the jury must find for the defen dants as to that payment.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b33-5\">b\u00edinth. The jury are instructed that a sheriff is authorized to receive anything in discharge of an execution but gold and silver and legal tender notes, unless the plaintiff authorizes him to receive something else. And if they believe from the evidence that the payment to the sheriff of $500 on the 3d of April, 1862, was made in Confederate money, then such payment was invalid, and its receipt unauthorized, unless consented to by the plaintiffs.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b33-7\">The court gave the instructions asked for by the plaintiffs, and the first and second instructions asked for by the defendants, and refused all the rest, and in lieu of the fifth instruction asked for gave the following:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b33-8\">That no officer receiving money under execution, when the party to whom it is payable resides in a different county from that in which the officer resides, is liable to have any judgment against him or his sureties for the nonpayment thereof, until a demand of payment be made of such officer in his county by such creditor, or his attorney-at-law, or some one having a written order of said creditor; and if the jury believe from the evidence that the plaintiffs resided out of this county when the money was collected by the defendant, or his deputy, and that no such demand \"for the said money was made, they cannot find for the plaintiffs as for money collected. But the jury, in investigating the alleged breach of the condition of the bond for failure to return, the execution of the plaintiffs against the defendants, may consider whether; from the evidence, the fact that no demand was made (if such was the fact) resulted from ignorance of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>the collection of the money growing out of the failin'\u00a9 to return the said execution.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AQ4\">The tenth bill of exception was to the refusal of the court to set aside the verdict and grant a new trial. The \u00b0f exception set out the facts proved, but it is unnecessary to state them. The defendants applied to a judge of this court for a writ of error and supersedeas; which was awarde&lt;f</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b34-9\"><em>Williams </em>\u00bff <em>Brother, </em>and <em>John E.

Grandstaff, in his county before the commencement of the action. The statute provides that an officer receiving money under an execution, when the creditor resides in a different county, shall not be liable to have any judgment rendered against him or his sureties for the non-payment of the mone}7 until a demand of payment shall be made of such officer in his county or corporation. Code of 1813, eh. 183, \u00a7 37.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-13\">If the declaration had averred the non-residence of the plaintiffs, it might be contended, with some reason, it should also aver a demand of payment. But the declaration does not show where the plaintiffs resided. For aught that appears to the contrary they resided in the same county with the sheriff'. It will be so intended unless the evidence shows the fact to be otherwise. If it appears on the trial that the plaintiff's and the sheriff are residents of different counties, it will devolve -on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>former to prove the demand in accordance with the provisions of the statute. The court is therefore of opinion that this ground of error is not.well taken.- <em>Obannon </em>v. <em>Saunders, </em>24 Gratt. 138.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-4\">The court is further of opinion that a sheriff or other officer has no authority to receive payment under an execution after the return day thereof, unless the execution has been previously levied. Such payment would not bind the creditor, nor would it impose any liability upon the sureties of the sheriff on his official bond. Although the sheriff may be responsible in his private capacity for money so received, no responsibility would attach to him in his official character on that account. 1 Rob. Prac. 532; <em>Chapman </em>v. <em>Harrison, </em>4 Rand. 336; Herman on Executions, 464, 336; <em>Obannon </em>v. <em>Saunders, </em>24 Gratt. 138. This was the settled doctrine prior to the revisal of 1849. The provisions then .adopted gave to the writ of <em>fieri f\u00e1cias </em>an absolute lien upon the debtor\u2019s personal estate, not limited to the time during which the execution was to run, but continuing until the right to levy a new execution ceases or is suspended by a forthcoming bond being given and forfeited, or by a <em>supersedeas </em>or other legal process, subject, however, to certain exceptions which do not apply to the present case, and need not now be considered. <em>Charron &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>Boswell &amp; als., </em>18 Gratt. 216, and cases there cited; Code of 1860, ch. 189, \u00a7\u00a7 3,4.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-5\">These provisions do not enlarge the powers of the sheriff with respect to executions, and were not so intended. They simply extend the lien for the benefit of the creditor. The authority of an officer to collect money in discharge of the execution does not result from the lien, but is a consequence of the right to sell the debtor\u2019s property under the execution. So long as the right to sell continues, the right to receive payment remains, but no longer. If the officer levies before the return day of the writ, he may sell, notwithstanding the return day has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>passed; and, as a necessary consequence, he may receive payment without selling. But if he fails to levy before return day, his authority to sell afterwards ceases, and with it the right to receive payment in discharge of ^-e ma^\u2019 course&gt; receive payment at anytime before the return day without a levy.</p>\n<p id=\"ACb\">Tested by this principle, the first count in the declara^011 must held *\u00b0 deficient in proper averments. It alleges that while the execution was in the hands of the deputy and a lien on the property of the debtor, the latter paid the deputy the whole amount of the debt in discharge of the execution. It does not, however, aver that the payment was made before the return day, or indeed when it was made; nor does it aver that the execution had ever been levied; so that every fact stated in the declaration may be true, and yet no liability may attach to the sheriff and his sureties by reason of the payment made to the deputy. The court is therefore of opinion that the demurrer to the first count ought to have been sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-10\">The court is further of opinion that, although a sheriff is liable to a fine, at the discretion of the proper court, for his failure to make due return of an execution, he is also liable to an action on his official bond by the party injured by such failure. The fine is in the nature of a punishment for a personal offence, and is not considered as'any satisfaction for the damage sustained by the creditor in being unjustly kept out of his money by the default of the sheriff or his deputy. When the fine is paid by the sureties of the sheriff, in any subsequent proceeding against them to enforce the j udgment !or decree upon which the execution issued, they will be entitled to a credit, upon the judgment .or decree for the amount of the fine, or fines, so paid. Code of 1873, ch. 49, \u00a7 28, page 475. See also <em>McDonald </em>v. <em>Burwell, adm'r, </em>4 Rand. 317; <em>Pardee </em>v. <em>Robertson, </em>6 Hill\u2019s R. 550.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>The fifth count of the declaration is founded upon an alleged breach of duty in failing to make due return of an execution in the hands of the deputy. This count, although not so specific in its averments as it might have been, is substantially sufficient upon general demurrer. The circuit court did not, therefore, err in overruling the demurrer to that count, nor in overruling the demurrer to the remaining counts in the declaration.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-4\">The court is further of opinion that the circuit court did not err in overruling defendants\u2019 objection to the witness, James M. Bradford, introduced by the plaintiffs, as set out in the first bill of exceptions, nor in overruling defendants\u2019 objection to the testimony of the same witness, as set out in the second bill of exceptions. Although the witness was the judgment debtor, and, was offered to prove, among other things, a payment made by him to the defendants\u2019 deputy, he was not so directly interested in the result of the suit, or in the verdict and judgment to be rendered, as to render him incompetent to testify in the cause. His testimony was clearly admissible at that stage of the trial, to prove the payment, because the plaintiffs might adduce evidence tending to show the levy before the return day of the execution. If they failed to do so, it was competent for the defendants to move to exclude all that the witness said with respect to the payment made by him.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-5\">The evidence set out in the third bill of exceptions was offered to show that the debtor, a few days after the payment, had directed that it should be applied to the plaintiffs\u2019 execution, and that the officer made no objection. This evidence was properly left to the jury to determine whether the officer had acquiesced in the direction of the debtor, and whether, under the circumstances, the officer could properly apply any part of the money to other claims in his hands against the debtor.</p>\n<p id=\"A4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>The court is further of opinion that the circuit court did not err in refusing to admit in evidence the execution set out in the fourth bill of exceptions. The return thereon showed it had been satisfied as far back as the 8th November, 1861. It was issued long after the plaintiffs\u2019 execution. It had, therefore, no apparent relevancy to the matter in controversy, and its only effect was to con-fuse the jury by multiplying collateral issues. The bill of exceptions does not show what was the amended return defendants proposed to make on the execution. Whatever it was, the application to amend ought to have been made to the county court from which the execution issued, and not to the circuit court in which the case was then being tried.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-6\">. The court is further of opinion that the circuit court erred in refusing to permit 13. F. Murray, the deputy sheriff, to testify as a witness in behalf of the defendants. The action was against the sheriff and his sureties for the default of this deputy in failing to pay over money collected under an execution. Second, for failing to levy and make due return of the execution. The witness was excluded upon the ground of interest in the result of the trial, arising out of his liability over to his principal, and because some of the sureties upon the official bond of the sheriff being dead, the plaintiffs could not testify under the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-7\">The language of the section of the statute relied on is as follows: And <em>where, one of the original parties to the contract or other transaction, lohich is the subject of investigation, </em>is dead or insane, or incompetent <em>to testify by </em>reason of infamy or other legal cause, <em>the other party </em>shall not be.permitted to testify in his own favor, or in favor of any other party having an interest adverse to that of the party so incapable of testifying, &amp;e.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-8\">In the case of <em>Grigsby </em>v. <em>Simpson, assignee, </em>decided by this court and reported in the April number, 1877, of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>the <em>Virginia Law Journal, </em>pp. 280, 232 (28 Gratt. 348), this court, Judge <em>Christian </em>delivering the opinion, held that the test of competency under the section just is the cause of action in issue and on trial, not the fact to which the party is called to testify. If the cause of action was a matter transacted with a person who has deceased, the other <em>partg to that transaction </em>is not admitted at all, and cannot testify to any fact in the case, otherwise he is admitted as a witness. The object of the statute is to put the parties (to the contract or other transaction) on the terms of equality, so that when the lips of oue of them are closed by death, or other cause, the adverse party shall not be heard.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-6\">The case of <em>Mason </em>v. <em>Wood et als., </em>27 Gratt. 783, is not at all in conflict with this view. There the witness was called on to testify as to matters occurring after the death of one of the obligors, and of which the latter of course knew nothing; but this court held the witness incompetent Judge <em>Anderson, </em>delivering the opinion of the court, said that under the statute there was no limitation of the incompetency as to the subject matter of the testimony. The witness could not be heard at all as to any fact. The reason was the obligor, who had died, was a party to the <em>contract </em>which was the subject of investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-7\">In this case the transaction which was the subject of investigation was the alleged default of the deputy sheriff. All the parties to that transaction were living and competent\u2019to testify in the cause. The sureties of the sheriff were liable on their bond for the default of the principal and his deputy, but they were not parties to the transaction which was the subject of investigation. They are neither within the letter nor spirit of the statute. Without, therefore, enquiring into the operation and effect of the release executed by the sheri, theft\u2019 court is of opinion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>that the deputy is a competent witness for the defendants . ... 111 \u2122is case.</p>\n<p id=\"AKg\">The court is further of opinion that the circuit court committed no error in refusing the application set forth \u2019n the seventh bill of exceptions, or in permitting the witness to testify as stated in the eighth bill of exceptions.</p>\n<p id=\"Aga\">The court is further of opinion that the circuit court did not err in giving the first, third and fourth instructions asked for by the plaintiffs. The second instruction affirms the erroneous proposition already adverted to in connection with the first count of the declaration, and that is, that a payment made to the sheriff is valid to bind him and his sureties upon the official bond, although made after the return day of the execution, and although the execution was not levied upon the property of the debtor. This subject has been already discussed, and need not be further considered. Tor the reasons heretofore stated, this instruction is erroneous, and ought not to have been given. .And for the same reason the circuit court erred in refusing to give defendants\u2019 third instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-8\">The court is further of opinion that the circuit court did not err in refusing to give the defendants\u2019 fourth instruction. It is the duty of an officer receiving money to apply it in satisfaction of the oldest execution in his hands. But in this case it did not necessarily follow that because the sheriff may have had older executions in his hands than the plaintiffs\u2019, it was his duty to apply to them the money received from the debtor in <em>1862. </em>The plaintiffs had offered testimony tending to show that a .short time after the payment was made the debtor requested the deputy to apply the money to the plaintiffs\u2019 execution; to which the deputy made no answer. This evidence was properly left to the jury, upon the question of the application of the payment with the consent of Ihe deputy. The court could not, therefore, give the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>defendants\u2019 fourth instruction without a manifest disregard of this evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-4\">The court is further of opinion that the circuit court did not err in giving to the jury the instruciou substituted by the court for the defendants\u2019 fifth instruction. Both instructions, the defendants\u2019 and that given by the court, informed the jury that an officer receiving money under an execution, but residing in a different county from the creditor, is not liable to have a judgment, rendered against him or his sureties, for the non-payment thereof, until a demand of payment is made of such officer in his county or corporation, by\u2019 the creditor or his attorney, or some'person having a written order from the creditor; and in this case if the jury believed from the evidence that the plaintiffs resided out of the county (the sheriff\u2019s), and that no such demand for the said money was made, they cannot find for the plaintiffs as for money collected.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-5\">To this the court made the following addition: \u201cBut the jury, in investigating the alleged breach of the condition of the bond for a failure to return the execution of the \u2018plaintiffs against defendants,\u2019 may consider whether from the evidence the fact that no demand was made (if such was the fact) resulted from ignorance of the collection of the money, growing out of the failure to return the said execution.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b41-6\">This addition was; perhaps, calculated, in some degree, to confuse the jury. When the creditor proceeds against the sheriff for <em>money collected </em>under an execution, a demand of payment in the sheriff\u2019s county is absolutely essential if the parties reside in different counties. In such case it does not matter whether the execution is 'or is not returned, or whether the creditor is or is not ignorant of the collection of the money. But when the creditor is also suing for a failure to make due return of the execution, as in the fifth count, no demand of payment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>is necessary previous to a judgment for such breach. The gist \u00b0i\u2019 the action <em>is the failure </em>to return the execution. circuit court might, therefore, have told the jury that so far as the action was for the failure to make return of the execution, no demand of payment was required. It wag not necessary to encumber the instruction with the <em>\u201d </em>qualification in regard to the ignorance of the plaintiffs. qualification, however, was not prejudicial to the defendants, and affords no just ground of complaint on their part.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-8\">The court is further of opinion that the circuit court committed no error in refusing the seventh, eighth and ninth instructions asked for by the defendants. But for the errors already stated, the verdict and judgment must be set aside, and the cause remanded to the circuit court for a new trial, in conformity with the views herein expressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-9\">The judgment was as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b42-10\">The court is of opinion, for reasons stated in writing and filed with the record, that the circuit court erred in overruling the demurrer to the first countin the declaration, and in refusing to permit B. F. Murray, the deputy sheriff, to testify as a witness in behalf of the plaintiffs in error, and in giving to the jury the second instruction of the defendant in error, and in refusing to give the third instruction of the plaintiff\u2019s in error, and that there is no other error in said record. It is therefore considered by the court that for the errors aforesaid the said judgment of the circuit court.be reversed and annulled, and that the defendants in error do pay to the plaintiffs in error their costs by them incurred in the prosecution of their writ of error and <em>supersedeas </em>aforesaid here. And. this court proceeding to render such judgment as the said circuit court ought to have rendered, it is considered by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>court that the verdict of the jury he set aside, and a new trial awarded; that the demurrer to the first count in the declaration be sustained, and leave given to the plaintiffs to amend their declaration, if they shall so desire, and upon any new trial to be had the said circuit court to conform to the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-4\">And the cause is remanded to the said circuit court for further proceedings in conformity with the views herein expressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-10\">Judgment reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
