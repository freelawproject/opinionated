Only tlie estate of a bankrupt, whatever it may be, at the time of bis becoming such, including any estate he may have aliened by an act fraudulent and void as to his creditors, is vested in his assignee in bankruptcy for the benefit of his creditors. Aud, therefore, no estate which may have been sold by him to a <em>bona fide </em>purchaser for valuable consideration fully paid prior to the act of bankruptcy, becomes so vested in said assignee.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b420-11\">2. A judgment creditor of a bankrupt whose judgment is a lien \u25a0 upon any estate <em>bona fide </em>sold-and conveyed by the bankrupt, before his bankruptcy, may claim and secure in the proceeding in bankruptcy, his portion of the estate of the bankrupt, in virtue of his said judgment, without accounting or giving-credit for anything on account of the lien of his judgment upon the estate so sold and conveyed.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b420-13\">3. Though such creditor may have so claimed and received in the proceeding in bankruptcy, his portion of the estate of the bankrupt, such judgment creditor may, by a suit in equity, enforce the lien of his said judgment upon the estate <em>bona fide </em>sold and conveyed before the act of bankruptcy, for the recovery of any balance of said judgment which may r-emain unsecured in the proceeding in bankruptcy; and that, though he may not, in the said proceeding, have asserted or given any notice of the lien of his said .judgment upon the estate so sold and conveyed.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b420-15\">This case was heard at Richmond, but was decided at Wytheville, It was a creditor\u2019s bill in the circuit court of Pittsylvania county, brought in 1870 by James McAden and others against W. W. Keen and Robert A. Walters and others, purchasers of real estate from Keen, to subject the said real estate to satisfy the judg<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>meats of tlie plaintiffs. There were two amendments of the bill bringing in other parties. It appears that in 1867 Keen filed his petition in bankruptcy, and in September, 1869, received his discharge; that these plaintiffs were creditors who proved their debts; that the lands they seek to subject in this suit to the payment of their judgments were sold and conveyed by Keen before he filed his petition in bankruptcy, and were not mentioned by him in his schedules; nor did the plaintiffs in-proving their debts refer to their judgment liens upon these lands. The real estate surrendered by Keen seems to have been absorbed by judgment debts having priority to those of the plaintiffs. The cause came on to be heard on the 9th of September, 1875, when the court expressed the opinion that the plaintiffs, having been parties to the suit in the bankrupt court, and claiming their debts therein, enforcing liens on property surrendered by the bankrupt, and failing to make known to the court other liens held by them upon other property, were estopped from maintaining a suit in any court to enforce their liens claimed in this suit; and without deciding any other question in .the cause, dismissed the bills with costs. And thereupon the plaintiffs obtained an appeal from the decree.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b421-4\"><em>E. E.

Walters, pay to the appellants their costs by them expended in the prosecution of their appeal aforesaid here; and that the cause be remanded to the said circuit court for further proceedings to be had therein to a final decree, in accordance with the principles herein-before declared; which is ordered to be. entered on the order-book here and forthwith certified to the clerk of this court at Richmond aforesaid, who shall enter the same on his order-book and certify it to the said circuit court of Pittsylvania county.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-10\">Decree reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
