By the terms of the contract defendant undertook for a certain price to furnish an Ohio Electric. . Plaintiff made a deposit of $100 which, in case there was no delivery, was to be refunded. Defendant agreed to allow plaintiff on the price of the electric car $600 for his Franklin gas car, which was to be traded in. Plaintiff claims that defendant failed to deliver the electric according to the contract. The trial court found in favor of plaintiff and assessed his damages at $700, being the amount of the deposit and the $600 for plaintiff\u2019s car, which had been delivered to defendant and sold by it. From this amount $225, the price of a \u201crectifier\u201d sold by defendant to plaintiff, was deducted and judgment was entered against defendant for $475. To reverse the judgment, defendant prosecutes a writ of error.</p><attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b413-8\" pgmap=\"413\">McArdle &amp; McArdle, for plaintiff in error.</attorneys><attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b413-9\" pgmap=\"413\">James Turnock, for defendant in error.</attorneys> <opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\"> <author id=\"b413-10\" pgmap=\"413\">Mr. Justice McSurely</author> <p id=\"AfbS\" pgmap=\"413\">delivered the opinion of the court.</p> <headnotes id=\"A5AY\" pgmap=\"414\">Abstract of the Decision.</headnotes> <headnotes id=\"A1X\" pgmap=\"414\">1.
