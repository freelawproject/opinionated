Defendant in borrowing the money had promised to pay it back at any time on demand, but when plaintiff asked him for it defendant asked for more time, promising to repay it on a certain day. When that day arrived, defendant, instead of repaying the loan, charged the plaintiff with theft, and refused to pay. At that time defendant had a lawyer present who asked plaintiff to explain two small discrepancies upon one of the cash register slips for that day. The lawyer called a policeman, and upon plaintiff begging not to be locked up the defendant replied he would let it go until Monday.</p><headnotes data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"AmJ\" pgmap=\"86\">Abstract of the Decision.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b86-11\" pgmap=\"86\">1.
