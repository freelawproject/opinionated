To reverse a judgment entered on a verdict in favor of plaintiff for twenty-five hundred dollars, defendant appeals.</p><p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b27-11\" pgmap=\"27(54) 28(180)\">At the time it is charged the slanderous words were spoken, plaintiff was a. student at the University of Chicago, and defendant was \u201cDean of Women\u201d of that institution. Although it is charged in the declaration that a variety of slanderous words were spoken by defendant of and concerning plaintiff at various times, the only words relied on by plaintiff as a basis of recovery are: \u201cWe know very well yon are getting your money from men. We do not consider you any more than a woman of the streets.\u201d It is alleged that these words were spoken by defendant of and concerning plaintiff on two different occasions; that the first of these occasions was on December 8, 1910, and that the second occasion was on January 9, 1911. Plaintiff claims that on December 8, 1910, Dean Vincent of the University of Chicago and a Miss Robinson, who was also connected with the University as \u201cHead of the Housing Bureau\u201d and teacher, were present, and heard the slanderous words spoken, and that on January 9, 1911, her brother, Henry D. Mercy, and her fiance, Warren E. Reynolds, were present and heard the slanderous charges repeated. By innuendo it is alleged that by the words spoken it was meant and intended to charge plaintiff with being a common prostitute and with being guilty of fornication. Defendant pleaded the general issue.</p><headnotes data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"Anm\" pgmap=\"28\">Abstract of the Decision.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"AODd\" pgmap=\"28\">1.
