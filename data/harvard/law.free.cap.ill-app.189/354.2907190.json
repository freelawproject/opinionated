An application to the Appellate Court for leave to file a petition for a writ of mandamus, to compel a trial judge to sign a bill of exceptions containing informal language of the judge to the attorneys before his final and recorded disposition of a motion for a new trial, was denied for the reason that the language had nothing to do with matters occurring at the trial or which could have in any way influenced the jury, and for the reason the action of the judge speaks for itself through the record as to the reasons for and against the allowance of a new trial.</headnotes><summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b380-6\" pgmap=\"380\">Original proceeding in the Appellate Court for mandamus against Hon.
