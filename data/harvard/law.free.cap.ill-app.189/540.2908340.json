Stozky against Edward Kobe and Cornelia Robe. The notes were so drawn that one of them fell due each month in succession. Three of the notes were paid and, on the defendants refusing to pay the remainder, judgment by confession was entered for $965. On motion of the defendants, leave was given them to plead and they filed joint pleas, alleging that the notes were obtained by fraud in that they were represented to be \u2022 simple promissory notes and not judgment notes. The case was tried by a court and jury and a verdict was rendered in favor of the defendants. A motion for new trial was overruled, judgment was entered on the verdict and the plaintiff appealed.</p><headnotes data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"A_Q\" pgmap=\"567\">Abstract of the Decision.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b567-8\" pgmap=\"567\">1. Instructions, \u00a7 87<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014when instruction as to burden of proof is misleading. An instruction in an action on promissory notes that the burden of proof was upon the plaintiff to establish the facts necessary to recovery, by a preponderance or greater weight of evidence, held misleading where the facts necessary to make out a prima facie case for the plaintiff were not disputed and the defendants relied on affirmative defenses, since the jury might conclude that the plaintiff was bound by law to establish the negative of the special defenses before he could recover.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b567-9\" pgmap=\"567\">2. Fraud, \u00a7 21<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014what false representations constitute fraud. The mere misrepresentation of a person as to the legal effect of the signing of notes does not constitute fraud at law and cannot be availed of as a defense to the notes.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b567-10\" pgmap=\"567(34) 568(35)\">3. Judgment, \u00a7 66<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014what will warrant setting aside of judgment by confession. The fact that a person was induced to sign judgment notes instead of simple promissory notes is not such fraud as will constitute a good defense, in an action where it is sought to set aside a judgment by confession, for if the amount of the judgment is owed it will not be set aside.</headnotes><attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b567-4\" pgmap=\"567\">Rudolph Frankenstein and H.
