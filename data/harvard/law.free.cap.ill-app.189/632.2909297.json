Giersch, Joseph F. Sass, Joseph Blacek and William Bykowski for violation of section 2012 of the Municipal Code of Chicago. The defendants were together acting in concert when the alleged violation of the ordinance occurred. A verdict of guilty was returned and a fine of one dollar was assessed against each defendant. To reverse the judgments entered on the verdicts, the defendants severally appealed and by agreement the causes were submitted in the Appellate Court on the record, abstract and briefs filed in the case against defendant Giersch.</p><p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b658-13\" pgmap=\"658(51) 659(73)\">Noble street runs into Milwaukee avenue from the north. Defendants were passengers on a southbound Noble street car and were given transfers. They took a car going northwest on Milwaukee avenue and asked for one transfer to Ashland avenue, which runs north and south. The conductor refused to give such transfer and told the defendants that none of them could ride farther than Division street and Ashland avenue. There was a car line on Division, an east and west street, to which defendants might have transferred if they had taken a northbound car on Noble street. When the Milwaukee avenue car reached Division street the conductor insisted that the defendants leave the car or pay another fare, but they refused to do either.</p><headnotes data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b659-7\" pgmap=\"659\">Abstract of the Decision.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b659-8\" pgmap=\"659\">1.
