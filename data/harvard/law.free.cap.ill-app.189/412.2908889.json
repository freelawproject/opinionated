Cermak and others. On the day of the trial, an order of court was entered requiring plaintiff to produce at the trial certain books and documents pertinent to the issue. Later in the day the case came up for trial before another judge. When this order was brought to his attention by filing a copy thereof, another order of the same purport was entered requiring plaintiff to produce some of the same books and documents at two o\u2019clock of the same day, and the hearing was continued to that time to enable plaintiff to comply with the order. At that hour, plaintiff\u2019s counsel stated that he went to plaintiff\u2019s plant about a mile away; that the bookkeeper was out; that he and plaintiff\u2019s secretary made' a search for the papers called for and were unable to find any books excepting a stub check book then produced. No other explanation was given and no further time was asked for. No further information being vouchsafed as to plaintiff\u2019s willingness or readiness to comply with the orders, the court, on defendant\u2019s motion, discharged the jury, dismissed the case and ordered that a writ of retorno habendo issue for the property taken under the replevin writ. To reverse the judgment, plaintiff appeals.</p><headnotes data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"AfW\" pgmap=\"439\">Abstract of the Decision.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b439-7\" pgmap=\"439\">Dissmissal nonsuit and discontinuance, \u00a7 39<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014when suit may he dismissed on failure of plaintiff to comply with order to produce hooks.
