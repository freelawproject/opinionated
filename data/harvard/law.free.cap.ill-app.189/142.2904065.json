The defendant in error was found guilty of a violation of the ordinance and a fine of fifty dollars was assessed. To reverse a judgment entered on the finding, defendant prosecutes a writ of error.</p><p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b169-6\" pgmap=\"169(131) 170(170)\">The facts showed that the defendant was organized as a corporation not for profit, the purposes of the corporation being \u201cto organize and maintain a social club for the encouragement of motoring and for the mutual benefit thereof, to own, run and maintain a clubhouse and garage to be enjoyed by the members of the club,\u201d and that certain persons were made officers of the corporation. A few months prior to the incorporation of the defendant, the Logan Square Motor Car Company, a corporation for profit, was incorporated with the same officers. Both of the corporations occupied. the same premises, which were owned by the wife of the vice-president of the defendant. The garage building occupied two lots and had a large entrance. The defendant corporation occupied the front part of the building except a small space which it allowed the Logan Square Motor Car Company to use in its business. The rear of the building was occupied by the latter corporation as repair rooms for cars. The defendant had no clubhouse or club-quarters except the premises in question. In order to become a member of the club a person signed an application card agreeing to pay. the club fifteen dollars per month as dues. He then had the right to immediately put his car in the garage whether it was a pleasure car or a business truck. It also appeared that no application for membership had been rejected and no investigation ever made of any applicant; that the only social affair given was a motor run that was participated in by four persons who were interested in the Logan Square Motor Company, and that the only privilege enjoyed by a member was the right to keep his car in the club garage.</p><p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b170-4\" pgmap=\"170\">Defendant contended that it was not a business organization conducting an establishment sought to be reached by the ordinance, but that it was a social organization of citizens, and that a license was only required for a public garage in the nature of a public livery stable. The plaintiff contended that the defendant was organized and maintained as a subterfuge to permit the operation of the garage without a license; and that even if it is conceded to be a bona fide club it is required to procure a license to maintain its garage.</p><attorneys data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b170-5\" pgmap=\"170\">William H.
