Defendant contended that she left without his consent and over his protest; that the engagement having been for the entire season or run of the play, plaintiff committed a breach of her contract and was therefore not entitled to recover; and furthermore, that by reason of the breach by plaintiff of her contract, defendant was damaged in a sum greater than the amount claimed by the plaintiff.</p><p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b537-5\" pgmap=\"537\">Plaintiff maintained that before the play opened she had notified defendant that she was dissatisfied with her part and would leave the company, and that defendant made no objection and consented to her doing so; further, that in leaving the company when she did, she did not breach her contract, but had a right to do so; and having rendered services for one week, she was entitled to payment therefor.</p><p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b537-6\" pgmap=\"537\">Plaintiff denied that there was an established custom and usage in the theatrical profession, with reference to the contract in question, as contended for by defendant.</p><p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b537-7\" pgmap=\"537(65) 538(63)\">To support his contention as to the alleged custom and usage, defendant testified that he had been a theatrical manager for many years; that he had made many contracts of this kind, not only with plaintiff but with other well-known actors and actresses; that there was a custom in the theatrical business in the city of New York, where this contract was made, and elsewhere throughout, the United States, that where an actor or actress engages to render services in a new play, and no time is specified in the agreement, the actor is supposed to play for the entire,season or run of the play; that the custom is long established and as well known among actors and artists engaged to perform as among managers and producers.</p><p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b538-4\" pgmap=\"538\">Frank C.
