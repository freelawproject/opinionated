Henriksen and others to foreclose a mechanic\u2019s lien on real estate belonging to Henriksen. After the issues of the original bill had been referred to a master the Holmes Disappearing Bed Company, a corporation, which was one of the parties defendant to the original bill, filed its answer in the nature of an intervening petition to foreclose a lien claim of its own against the certain buildings involved in the original proceeding. Subsequently the claims of Herr were settled, the original bill dismissed and Herr\u2019s lien discharged without prejudice to the Holmes Disappearing Bed Company, leaving the issues in the case solely between the company and'the remaining defendants.</p><p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b141-10\" pgmap=\"141(115) 142(20)\">The intervening petition filed by the Holmes Disappearing Bed Company set out the fact of the ownership of the buildings in Henriksen, and stated that said Henriksen requested petitioner to furnish and deliver at said premises, for use therein, four disappearing beds and four bookcases and writing desks combined, for each of the buildings, and that there was a written contract evidencing the agreement between the parties. The master reported a finding that Henriksen was indebted to petitioner in the sum of $588 with interest, and that he was entitled to a lien therefor. Upon the report of the master, the court, without hearing any other evidence, entered a decree confirming and approving the master\u2019s report and declaring petitioner entitled to a lien. To reverse the decree, the defendant Henriksen appeals.</p><headnotes data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"AWKt\" pgmap=\"142\">Abstract of the Decision.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b142-10\" pgmap=\"142\">1.
