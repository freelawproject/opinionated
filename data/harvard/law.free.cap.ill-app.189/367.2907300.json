The Ford Company had in Chicago a shop where it repaired automobiles. In this shop one Walters was employed as mechanic \u201cto overhaul motors.\u201d On the day of the accident plaintiff telephoned the Ford Company, asking: \u201cCan I bring my car down to locate a rattle?\u201d and was told that he could. The same afternoon he took his car to the Ford shop, was introduced to Walters and told by Nicollett, who was in charge of the shop: \u201cHere is a good man to take out and locate the rattle.\u201d Walters had quit work for the day and was about to go home. He lived three miles south of the Ford shop and plaintiff lived several blocks farther south. Walters got into the car with plaintiff, who drove it south to Twenty-third street. There, on the suggestion of plaintiff, he and Walters changed seats, Walters taking the steering wheel and plaintiff sitting by his side. At Thirty-second street plaintiff told Walters to turn into Thirty-second street. Walters did so, proceeded east to Indiana avenue, and there the car was struck by a Chicago City railway car and plaintiff sustained the injuries complained of.</p><p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b394-4\" pgmap=\"394\">Plaintiff had judgment against both defendants for fifteen hundred dollars.
