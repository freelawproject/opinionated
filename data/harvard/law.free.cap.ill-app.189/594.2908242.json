Such agreement acknowledged the receipt of a certain sum of money to he applied on a ninety-nine-year lease of property, stated the terms of such lease and was signed by \u201cAndrew Spetz, C. R.,\u201d the initials being alleged to be an abbreviation for \u201cCongregation of the Resurrection.\u201d The defendants denied the right of the plaintiff to the relief sought on the ground that the agreement was not the act of the corporation and that Spetz had no authority to contract for it, that the initials in question referred to another corporation and that the agreement was void under the statute of frauds as not signed by the party to be bound by it. The cause was referred to a master in chancery who reported that the contract was void because within the statute of frauds and that the bill should be dismissed.
