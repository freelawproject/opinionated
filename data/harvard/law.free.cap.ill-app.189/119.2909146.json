The plaintiff accepted the amount of the principal under protest.</p><headnotes data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"A2W\" pgmap=\"147\">Abstract of the Decision.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b147-9\" pgmap=\"147\">Interest, \u00a7 4<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014construction of agreement as to time interest begins to run. A certificate of deposit given, for money advanced to a city for having certain water pipe extensions made in a street, construed as providing that a specified rate of interest was to begin to run on the deposit two years after the date of the deposit, instead of two years after a survey showing a permanent annual revenue of ten cents per foot derived from the water mains so laid (following Merchants Loan and Trust Co. v. City of Chicago, 264 Ill. 76).</headnotes><p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b147-4\" pgmap=\"147\">The case was tried by the court without a jury. The parties stipulated \u201cthat, during a period from 1905 to 1911, the City of Chicago had, in numerous instances, repaid to the holders of similar certificates the principal and interest at the rate of three and one-half per cent, per annum upon said deposits, the interest being computed in these other cases at a period beginning two years after the date of the deposit of the money with the City up to the date of payment, and that the City has done this in cases where a survey had not been made. \u2019 \u2019 To reverse a judgment for defendant, plaintiff prosecutes a writ of error.</p><attorneys data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b147-5\" pgmap=\"147\">Burke, Jackson &amp; Burke, for plaintiff in error.</attorneys><attorneys data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b147-6\" pgmap=\"147\">William H.
