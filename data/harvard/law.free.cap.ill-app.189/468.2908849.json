He testified that when he went away he kept his key and told his wife that he \u201creserved the right to come and go as he pleased, that he wanted to come back once in a while, and that he would be back the following Sunday for his linen.\u201d He testified further that the immediate cause of his leaving home in this manner was that his wife was continually \u201cnagging\u201d him, by accusing him, without cause, of improper relations with other women. The wife testified, on the other hand, that for a long time before he left home he was in the habit of remaining out at night until a late hour, and sometimes all night; that this habit had been the occasion of frequent quarrels between them; that on two occasions, more than five years prior to the filing of the bill, he had struck her during such quarrels; that these offenses had been forgiven, but that the offense was repeated one night about two weeks prior to the time he left home. Defendant admitted all this except the last offense. He denied that he struck appellee on the last occasion referred to, but admitted, on cross-examination, that he had \u201cpushed her back on the pillow,\u201d and told her to \u201clie down and go to sleep.\u201d</p><headnotes data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"A4A\" pgmap=\"495\">Abstract of the Decision.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b495-8\" pgmap=\"495\">1.

Where a petition for a change of venue is presented to a court after the\u2019 trial of the case has commenced, it is presented too late, so that the trial court does not err in denying it.</headnotes> <headnotes id=\"b496-4\" pgmap=\"496\">3. Appeal and error, \u00a7 749<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>-\u2014how proceedings for change of venue are preserved for review. When a petition for a change of venue in a chancery case is treated and considered as an affidavit, the ruling of the trial court is not saved for review, unless the petition is made part of the record by a certificate of evidence.</headnotes> <headnotes id=\"AD3b\" pgmap=\"496\">4. Husband and wife, \u00a7 267<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014when a finding that the wife is living apart from her husband for his fault will not be disturbed. In an action for separate maintenance, where the chancellor, witnesses before him, finds the husband\u2019s fault, and not that of the wife, brought about an admitted separation, a reviewing court will not disturb the decree which is supported by the preponderance of the evidence.</headnotes> <headnotes id=\"b496-8\" pgmap=\"496\">5. Husband and wife, \u00a7 243<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014when allowance for separate maintenance not excessive. Where it appeared that a husband\u2019s salary was one hundred dollars a week and that he had other sources of income, and that while the parties were living together his wife received from him a regular allowance of thirty-five dollars a week for household expenses and that when he left home he made arrangements to pay his wife an allowance of twenty-five dollars a week, he has no just cause of complaint against a decree awarding thirty dollars a week towards the support of his wife and her minor child and allowing her to remain in possession of the family homestead, worth about nine thousand dollars.</headnotes> </opinion> </casebody> ",
