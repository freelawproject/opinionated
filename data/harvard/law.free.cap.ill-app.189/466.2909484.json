Garvy against Dan Baldino and William Tortoriello, in which, after two general demurrers to plaintiff\u2019s bill had been overruled and the defendants had elected to stand by their demurrers, the bill was taken as confessed, and defendants were ordered to pay to complainant, within ten days, the sum of $2,700, or if not paid within that time to assign and surrender to complainant, as security for the payment thereof, certain notes in their possession, and, in the meantime, they were enjoined from transferring the notes. From a decree in favor of complainant, defendants appeal.</p><p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b492-8\" pgmap=\"492(136) 493(143)\">In substance, the bill charged that complainant, being the owner of certain real estate in Cook county, employed defendant Baldino, who was a real estate broker, to find a buyer for her property for the best obtainable price; that Baldino found a purchaser named Laporte, who agreed to pay $25,200 for the property; that instead of reporting that fact to complainant, Baldino, in violation of his duty as complainant\u2019s agent, and in order to derive a secret profit from the sale of her property, entered into a fraudulent arrangement with the defendant Tortoriello, by which the latter, in consideration of $500 to be paid him by Baldino, agreed to become the ostensible purchaser of the property at the pretended price of $22,500, and then to convey the same to Laporte for $25,200; that in pursuance of such arrangement Baldino falsely and fraudulently represented to complainant that Tortoriello was the real purchaser, and that $22,500 was the highest price obtainable for the property ; that relying upon the representations of Baldino, complainant conveyed the property to Tortoriello, who paid her, ostensibly on his own behalf, but in reality on behalf of Baldino, the sum of $3,500 in easily $500 to Baldino for commissions, and gave his notes secured by trust deed on the property for the remaining $18,500 of the fictitious purchase price of $22,500; that a day or two later, Tortoriello completed the fraudulent transaction by conveying the property to Laporte and his wife for the real consideration of $25,200, thereby obtaining a secret profit of $2,700 in cash and notes, which, in equity and good conscience, belonged to complainant.</p><headnotes data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"ASN2\" pgmap=\"493\">Abstract of the Decision.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b493-8\" pgmap=\"493\">1.
