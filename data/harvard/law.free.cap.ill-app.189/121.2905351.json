Roberts. In the statement of claim the plaintiffs charged that the \u201cdefendant, Mary A. Roberts, wrongfully, wickedly and feloniously conspiring with one Fred F. Roberts, her husband, to cheat and defraud the plaintiffs induced them to deliver to her certain furniture then \"the property of the plaintiffs, of the value of, to-wit: Three Hundred and Fifty Dollars ($350.00) and to accept in payment therefor the note of one Rudolph E. Hamann, an employee of the defendant, which said note the defendant well knew the said Hamann was and would be unable to pay, and was therefore worthless, but which the defendant and said Fred F. Roberts represented to the plaintiffs was good. Plaintiffs aver further, that shortly thereafter the defendant sold the said furniture so wrongfully obtained by her, and received the entire proceeds of the said sale.\u201d The defendant filed an affidavit of merits specifically denying each and every one of the allegations of the statement of claim. The -case was tried before the court without a jury, and the court found the defendant guilty, and assessed the plaintiffs\u2019 damages at the sum of $350 in tort, and judgment was entered upon the finding. To reverse the judgment, defendant prosecuted a writ of error.</p><p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b148-6\" pgmap=\"148\">Defendant urged as ground for reversal: (a) That the finding and judgment is wholly unsupported by the evidence in the case; (b) That the finding is contrary to the weight of the evidence; (c) that the finding and judgment of the Municipal Court are contrary to the findings of fact made and the propositions of law by the court.</p><p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b148-7\" pgmap=\"148\">The following proposition of law was submitted to the court by the defendant and marked \u201cheld\u201d:</p><p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b148-8\" pgmap=\"148(30) 149(79)\">\u201cThe court holds as a matter of law that before there can be any recovery by the plaintiffs in this case, the plaintiffs must prove\" by a preponderance of the evidence that the defendant falsely represented to the plaintiffs that the note of Rudolph E. Hamann was good; and that the plaintiffs, relying upon such representations of the defendant and believing such representations to be true, accepted said note in payment of the furniture in question; and the plaintiffs must further prove that at the time the defendant made such representations, said'representations were in fact false and that the defendant knew such representations to be false.\u201d</p><headnotes data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"AKu\" pgmap=\"149\">Abstract of the Decision.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b149-8\" pgmap=\"149\">1.
