A part of said sum was alleged to be due plaintiff as an overpayment on a contract for work and materials furnished by defendant; another part was claimed to be a balance due for carpenter work done by plaintiff for defendant under another contract; and the balance was claimed to be due for other work and materials furnished to defendant by plaintiff. Defendant claimed he was not liable for anything set forth in plaintiff\u2019s statement of claim, and filed a counterclaim for the amount of $300. The cause was tried by the court without a jury and plaintiff had judgment for $188. To reverse the judgment, defendant prosecutes a writ of error.</p><attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b171-10\" pgmap=\"171\">Blum &amp; Blum, for plaintiff in error.</attorneys><attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"pAg9\" pgmap=\"171\">Kaplan &amp; Kaplan, for defendant in error.</attorneys><headnotes data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"A7N\" pgmap=\"172\">Abstract of the Decision.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b172-6\" pgmap=\"172\">1.

In determining the preponderance of the evidence, there is no hard and fast rule which forbids a trial court from believing one witness rather than two others that contradict him; it all depends on the circumstances, the witnesses and the nature of the testimony.</headnotes> <opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\"> <author id=\"b172-4\" pgmap=\"172\">Mr. Presiding Justice Brown</author> <p id=\"AyG\" pgmap=\"172\">delivered the opinion of the court.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
