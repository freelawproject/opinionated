F. Massey Company, a corporation, for five thousand dollars for the death of Frank Kosatka. The facts stated below are substantially taken from the opinion:</p><p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b417-13\" pgmap=\"417(14) 418(155)\">Defendant manufactured concrete battery wells, used for the signal service of railroads. These wells resembled in shape large milk bottles. The perpendicular walls are five feet five inches high. Above this is a shoulder tapering inward, about ten inches high, and above this the neck extending about eighteen inches high. The opening in the top is twenty-eight to thirty inches in diameter, and at the bottom the well is about four feet ten inches in diameter. In the late afternoon of August 11, 1912, decedent, while working as a painter in the shop of the defendant, went into one of these wells, using a ladder, and proceeded to paint the inside. Whether or not he did this acting under a specific order from the foreman is disputed. He was not thereafter seen alive, but the next morning shortly after seven o\u2019clock he was found lying dead tin the inside of the well. That his death was caused by paint and gasoline fumes seems to be admitted.</p><p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b418-5\" pgmap=\"418(197) 419(16)\">On behalf of the administrator a witness testified that about 2:30 o\u2019clock on the afternoon of August 11th, the foreman, Barry, said to the decedent: \u201cFrank, get some of that paint, I want you to paint some battery wells on the inside up here;\u201d that decedent went immediately to the paint barrel, filled a can with paint, then mixed it with gasoline, and walked with the foreman to the battery wells, and was seen with his hand on a ladder which was leaning against the well in which his body was subsequently found. Contradicting this, the foreman testified that his order was: \u201cAs soon as he finished the job he was on that I had some bottoms of wells to paint, to hunt me up and let me know, and I would show him what I wanted done.\u201d Another witness gave testimony tending to corroborate the foreman. Respective counsel seek to support each story by evidence and argument concerning the circumstances of the situation and the usual manner of doing the work. For instance, it is strongly urged by defendant that the inside walls of the wells were never painted, but only the bottoms. This is disputed by testimony to the effect that sometimes the entire inside was painted.</p><headnotes data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"AtGq\" pgmap=\"419\">Abstract of the Decision.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b419-9\" pgmap=\"419\">1. Witnesses, \u00a7 253<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014when credibility of witness is for jury. The credibility of a witness is for. the jury, in the absence of surrounding conditions such as to make his story impossible or improbable.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b419-11\" pgmap=\"419\">2. Master and servant, \u00a7 197<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014when master bound to warn of dangers from fumes of paint and gasoline. Where decedent was given a specific order to paint the interior of a concrete battery well, the jury could properly believe from the evidence that paint and gasoline used in such a receptacle would give off fumes dangerous to the life of one working therein, so that the defendant must have been negligent in giving the specific order without warning of the dangers involved.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b419-12\" pgmap=\"419\">3. Master and servant, \u00a7 379<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014when servant does not assume the risk incident to place and work. Evidence held insufficient to show that a painter assumed the risk from fumes in working in a battery well.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b419-13\" pgmap=\"419\">4. Negligence, \u00a7 188<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014when evidence sufficient to show due care of deceased. In the absence of direct testimony, the evidence is held to show clue care on the part of decedent, who met his death from the fumes of paint and gasoline while painting a battery well.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b419-14\" pgmap=\"419\">5. Negligence, \u00a7 188<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014presumption as to due care for safety. While the burden of proving due care for safety is upon the one asserting it, even if there is no direct evidence as to the conduct of a decedent in this respect, in an action to recover for his death from the fumes of paint and gasoline while painting the interior of a battery well, the decedent is entitled to the presumption that men naturally seek to avoid injury and to preserve their own lives.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b419-15\" pgmap=\"419(26) 420(75)\">6. Death, \u00a7 58<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014what may be considered in arriving at damages by loss of a brother or son. In an action to recover for the death of decedent, an instruction authorizing the jury to consider not only what the parents of the decedent might reasonably have expected, if he had lived, but also what his adult brothers and sisters might have expected, is not erroneous, where the jury are limited to the consideration of the testimony upon the question and are told to consider only what the evidence showed the next of kin might reasonably expect in a pecuniary way.</headnotes><p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b419-4\" pgmap=\"419\">A judgment was entered in favor of the- administrator, and the defendant appeals from the judgment.</p><attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b419-5\" pgmap=\"419\">Holt, Cutting &amp; Sidley, for appellant.</attorneys><attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b419-6\" pgmap=\"419\">Francis X.

Master and servant, \u00a7 307<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014when court may refuse an abstract instruction as to assumption of risk. In an action to recover for a death caused by paint and gasoline fumes arising while decedent was painting the interior of a concrete battery well, it was not erroneous to refuse to give an instruction containing an abstract statement of the law as to assumption of risk, which ignored entirely the theory and proof that the decedent was obeying a specific order in painting the well.</headnotes> <headnotes id=\"b420-5\" pgmap=\"420\">8. Instructions, \u00a7 151<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>-\u2014when requested instruction may be refused.
