D. 1910, to terminate this agreement\u201d by giving a written notice to that effect \u201cand repaying to said second party such a pro rata share of said sum of One thousand three hundred and twenty-five ($1,325) Dollars as the then unexpired term of this agreement shall bear to the entire term.\u201d</p><p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b65-4\" pgmap=\"65\">At the time this agreement was made, Kalthoff was in possession of certain premises under a lease from a third party to him, for a term of five years, beginning March 1, 1909, and ending April 30, 1914, in which lease there was a clause reserving to the lessor the right to cancel the same on May 1, 1911, or any time thereafter, by giving the lessee six months\u2019 written notice of its intention so to do, and paying him, if so terminated between November 1, 1911, and November 1, 1912, the sum of $2,000. It was admitted upon the trial that the contract sued upon was drawn by the plaintiff\u2019s attorneys, with full knowledge, on their part, of the existence and terms of this lease. It was also admitted that the lessor served notice on November 16, 1911, of its intention to cancel the lease, and that on May 18, 1912, Kalthoff \u201csurrendered and delivered up possession of said saloon to the lessor who thereupon tore down and removed the building within which the saloon in question was situate.\u201d</p><p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b65-5\" pgmap=\"65(40) 66(80)\">This suit was brought to recover back so much of the $1,325 paid by the plaintiff as the unexpired term of the contract bears to the whole term of five years. The defendant claimed that there is no provision in the contract which expressly requires him to refund any part of the money thus advanced in case of a destruction of the premises, and that it was the duty of the plaintiff, under the circumstances, to have inserted a clause in the contract to cover that contingency, if it so desired. The court sitting without a jury found in favor of the defendant and entered judgment on the finding. To reverse the judgment, plaintiff prosecutes a writ of error.</p><headnotes data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b66-8\" pgmap=\"66\">Abstract of the Decision.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b66-9\" pgmap=\"66\">1.
