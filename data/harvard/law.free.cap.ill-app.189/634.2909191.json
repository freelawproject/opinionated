E. Chipman to foreclose a trust deed in the nature of a mortgage. Julius Stichert was made a party defendant and filed an answer and a cross-bill. Stichert, according to his cross-bill, purchased the mortgaged property of the mortgagor, Dickinson, subsequent to the execution of the trust deed, and in his cross-bill he prayed for an accounting with the mortgagor. The court sustained a demurrer to said cross-bill, dismissed the same and entered a decree of foreclosure. Stichert prosecuted an appeal to the Appellate Court assigning for error the order sustaining the demurrer to his cross-bill and dismissing the same, and that court held that the appeal did not bring before it the error assigned and affirmed the decree. See 183 Ill. App. 122.

On a bill to foreclose a trust deed, a person made a partydefendant and claiming an interest in the property as a purchaser thereof from the mortgagor subsequent to the execution of the trust deed held not entitled to file a cross-bill praying for an accounting with the mortgagor, since to permit him to do so would delay the foreclosure proceeding and incumber the record with questions not necessary or properly involved in such proceeding.</headnotes> <footnote data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\"> <p id=\"b661-6\" pgmap=\"661\">See Illinois Notes Digest, Vols.
