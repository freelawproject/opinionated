Defendant claimed that on October 27th, the day in question, plaintiff was indebted to him for goods to the amount of $26.30. On this day plaintiff came into the store and bought some goods, amounting to $22, for which he paid defendant cash. These goods were done up in a bundle and delivered to plaintiff, and the $22 was handed to defendant. The bundle was left for a short time on the counter, while plaintiff looked at other goods, and thereupon the defendant took the bundle, and when plaintiff inquired where his bundle of goods was defendant replied: \u201cTon owe me enough dollars, and you get out,\u201d at the same time shoving the plaintiff out of the store.</p><headnotes data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"AKH4\" pgmap=\"407\">Abstract of the Decision.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b407-9\" pgmap=\"407\">Trover and conversion, \u00a7 39<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014when finding as to ownership of goods warranted by the evidence.
