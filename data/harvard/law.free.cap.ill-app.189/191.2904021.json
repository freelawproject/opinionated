The declaration on which the cause was sent to the jury consisted of two counts. The first of these alleged: That the defendant \u201cowned, possessed, managed, operated and controlled\u201d a machine for testing iron couplers, consisting of a heavy hammer, to which hammer was attached at the top thereof a certain chain,, which chain fastened by a hook, by which hook and chain the hammer was raised for the purpose of causing it to descend and strike the material placed beneath it and thereby test the strength of said material; that at that time the plaintiff, then a minor of tender years and a Russian subject, was working for the defendant as a servant; that the defendant, by its foreman, \u201cwho was not a fellow-servant of plaintiff and to whom plaintiff owed the .duty of obedience, carelessly and negligently fastened said chain on said hammer in an insecure and unsafe manner, and so that said hammer was likely to become unfastened and fall by reason thereof and without any act on the part of the operator of said hammer to cause it to fall,\u201d which defendant knew, etc., and plaintiff did not know, etc., \u201cand while plaintiff at all times in the exercise of ordinary care and caution for his own personal safety and in performance of his duty to said defendant as sl servant as aforesaid, was in the act of placing a certain knuckle under said hammer for the purpose of testing the same, said hammer became unfastened from said chain and hook by and through the carelessness and negligence of said lefendant as aforesaid, and fell to and upon the hand of plaintiff, \u2019 \u2019 thereby severing the fingers from the plaintiff\u2019s hand.</p><p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b218-5\" pgmap=\"218(51) 219(98)\">The other count alleged that the defendant by the foreman, who was not a fellow-s\u00e9rvant, etc., \u201ccarelessly and negligently ordered plaintiff to place a certain knuckle under said hammer for the purpose of testing same, while the chain and hook upholding said hammer was weakly, insecurely and insufficiently fastened and so that said hammer was likely to fall by reason thereof without any act of the operator to cause it to fall, which defendant knew or by the exercise of due care ought to have known and which plaintiff did not know and did not assume the risk thereof, and could not have known by the exercise of ordinary care, \u2019 \u2019 and that while the plaintiff was, in obedience to said order, placing a knuckle under said hammer, etc., the hammer, by reason of the aforesaid negligence of the defendant, fell on his hand.</p><p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b219-4\" pgmap=\"219(284) 220(23)\">Besides the general issue, a plea of the statute of limitations was filed, to which an amended replication was made by leave of court during the trial. The replication was, in effect, that the suit was brought before the plaintiff had come of age. A trial of the cause before a jury began March 31,1913, and on April 2,1913, terminated by a verdict for plaintiff in the sum of twenty-five hundred dollars. On the last day before the cause was finally taken by the jury, counsel for the defendant moved the court to suspend the trial of the cause until the next day to enable the defendant to present the testimony of one O. F. Heywood. This motion was supported by affidavit of the counsel that Heywood was a material witness for the defense, and that he expected him to testify to certain matters (set forth in the affidavit), and that Heywood resided in Pittsburg, Pennsylvania; that he had started from there April 1, 1913, to come to Chicago to testify in the cause, but had telegraphed that his train was delayed and that he could not arrive in Chicago until about 5 P. M. on the second. Tuesday, April 1, being a legal holiday the court had not convened. Counsel for the plaintiff consented that the counsel for the defendant might state to the jury that the defendant claimed that the witness would testify as stated in the affidavit, but refused to admit that the witness would testify to all the matters mentioned therein, specifying those which were thus excepted. The motion to suspend or continue was then denied. The entire affidavit of counsel was read to the jury by him, but he indicated the parts which stated what the plaintiff refuse^, to admit the absent witness would have sworn to.</p><headnotes data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"AsP\" pgmap=\"220\">Abstract of the Decision.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b220-11\" pgmap=\"220\">1.
