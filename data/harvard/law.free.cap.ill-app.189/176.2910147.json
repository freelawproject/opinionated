Johnson to recover a certain sum claimed to be due for plumbing work done in Johnson\u2019s saloon under a contract with Johnson for the Brewing Company. Upon Johnson\u2019s failure to appear, an order of the court was entered on January 24, 1913, which, after reciting a rule upon Johnson to appear instanter and his being called in open court, and also service of process \u201ca sufficient number of days prior to the time required of said defendant to appear as aforesaid to now require of said defendant that said defendant either appear in this cause at this time or that said defendant suffer judgment by default for want of such appearance,\u201d proceeded as follows:</p><p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b203-4\" pgmap=\"203\">\u201cIt is on motion of the plaintiff ordered by the Court that judgment be entered herein against the defendant John A.
