The death of the deceased was claimed to have resulted from one of defendant\u2019s cars running into a wagon in which he was riding at the time he was crossing the tracks of defendant at a street intersection.

Trial, \u00a7 130<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> when remarks of counsel improper and prejudicial. Where, on cross-examination of one of defendant\u2019s witnesses, plaintiff\u2019s counsel brought out the fact that he had talked with the witness in the corridor of the court, and that the witness after being informed that counsel represented plaintiff refused to tell him what he knew about the facts of the case, and defendant\u2019s counsel in his argument to the jury persisted, after objections sustained thereto, in arguing that the purpose of counsel for plaintiff in talking with the witness was to induce him to change his testimony, held that the remarks of counsel were highly improper as the evidence did not sustain the charge made against plaintiff's counsel, and held that the remarks were prejudicial.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b166-6\" pgmap=\"166\">2. Trial, \u00a7 47<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014when remarks of court prejudicial. A remark of the trial judge intimating that counsel for plaintiff was wasting time in asking a certain question of defendant\u2019s witness on cross-examination, and after exception taken to the remark, a further remark to plaintiff\u2019s counsel that at the conclusion of the trial he would expect counsel to wait until he had an opportunity to discuss further the matters of his objection, held prejudicial as tending to unduly disparage plaintiff\u2019s counsel in the eyes of the jury, it appearing that the question asked on cross-examination was proper, and that the jury would have understood from the language used by the court, that plaintiff\u2019s counsel was not only wasting time but that he was disrespectful in his conduct towards the court, and that the court was intimating that he would punish him for contempt at the conclusion of the trial.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b166-7\" pgmap=\"166\">3.
