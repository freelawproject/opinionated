Rasmussen and Robert Gage, trading as Rasmussen &amp; Gage, and Modern Steel Structural Company, a corporation, to recover for personal injuries sustained by plaintiff while working in the erection of structural iron for a building in the employ of defendants Gage and Rasmussen. No service was had on defendant Rasmussen. Plaintiff recovered a judgment against the Gage and the Steel Company. To reverse the judgment, the defendant Steel Company appealed and the defendant Gage sued out a writ of error. The appeal and writ of error were consolidated in the Appellate Court for hearing.</p><p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b625-13\" pgmap=\"625(66) 626(80)\">The Steel Company had a contract with Arthur J. O\u2019Leary &amp; Son Company to provide all the materials and iron work for the building. The firm of Rasmussen &amp; Gage made \u00e1 proposal to the Steel Company to unload, erect and rivet the structural steel and the proposal was accepted by the Steel Company. Gage took charge of the work and hired one Owen Keetley to act as foreman of the men employed on the job. There was a derrick in operation by which iron columns were put in place and Keetley ordered plaintiff and another workman to hook a chain to a column that it might be raised by the engine. The chain was hooked around the column and Keetley signaled the engineer to start the engine, and after it had been raised the end of the column slipped' and fell on plaintiff.</p><p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AA2\" pgmap=\"626\">After the trial and verdict plaintiff filed on November 21, 1911, three \u201cadditional counts.\u201d There was a motion by the defendants the next day, however (November 22, 1911), to strike out these additional counts, which motion was denied. No specific assignment of error called in question the rightfulness of the order allowing an additional count or refusing to strike out the counts that were filed. There were, however, exceptions reserved to the allowance of the motion for leave to file \u201can additional count.\u201d All of the three counts of November 21st asserted the basis of the joint liability to be that the Steel Company was the operator of the derrick and the employer of the plaintiff, and that defendant Gage was the superintendent of the Company; that the defendants had the duty to place the derrick on a safe place and violated that duty by placing it on soft and yielding ground. The first and third of the counts also asserted that the defendants negligently caused the load to be suddenly moved and that the net result, so to speak, was the accident. The third count specifically charged that the defendants negligently placed the derrick and that the Steel Company employed Keetley as its foreman under Gage; that Keetley acted as foreman under Gage; that Gage had general supervision and control of the work for the Steel Company, and that Keetley carelessly ordered the boom of the derrick to be suddenly shifted and \u201cby reason of the joint and concurrent negligence of the defendants and each of them co-operating with the negligence of their servant, Owen Keetley,\u201d the accident happened.</p><p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b627-3\" pgmap=\"627\">The second count of November 21st was specifically based on statutory liability. It declared that the Steel Company employed the plaintiff as an iron worker and Gage as its superintendent having charge .of the appliances and workmen, and that Gage was in charge of the derrick and the placing thereof \u201con behalf of the other defendant, the Modern Steel Structural Company, and with their knowledge and consent and subject to their orders- and directions.\u201d It further asserted that the defendants did not erect the derrick safely in accordance with the Statute of June 3, 1907, concerning structural work (Hurd\u2019s Rev. St. 1913, ch. 48, \u00a7 9, J. &amp; A. \u00b6 5377), and that as a direct result of the wilful violation of the statute and of the wilful failure of the defendants to comply with the provisions thereof, the accident happened.</p><p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"A4_\" pgmap=\"627\">After denial of the defendants\u2019 motion on November 22, 1911, to strike.the additional counts of November 21, 1911, from the files, the following order was entered by the court:</p><p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"A6Un\" pgmap=\"627\">\u201cIt is ordered that the defendants\u2019 plea of general issue filed herein stand as pleaded to all counts of said declaration, and on like motion leave is given the defendant Modern Steel Structural Company to file a special plea to all counts of the declarations filed in said cause, instanter.\u201d</p><p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b627-7\" pgmap=\"627(132) 628(25)\">In pursuance of said leave the Steel Company filed on said November 22nd a special plea, in which it asserted that it was not engaged in the erection of the O\u2019Leary warehouse; that on July-28, 1910, it let the contract for the unloading, erection and riveting of all the - structural steel for said warehouse to the firm of Rasmussen &amp; Gage, who thereafter were succeeded by Robert B. Gage; that thereafter Rasmussen &amp; Gage and their successor Gage \u201ctook charge of and had absolute and complete control of\u201d all said work, \u201cfree from any supervision or control by the Modern Steel Structural Company\u201d; that the plaintiff was the servant of Rasmussen &amp; Gage or Gage, and not of the Steel Company, and that the hoisting apparatus and derrick were not at the time of the accident the property of the defendant \u201cnor under its management, control or supervision nor in its possession.\u201d</p><headnotes data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"AF3x\" pgmap=\"628\">Abstract of the Decision.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b628-12\" pgmap=\"628\">1.

While it may be unwise to re-arrange the pleadings after verdict pending a motion for new trial, if a declaration is so amended to suit the plaintiff\u2019s evidence, plaintiff cannot complain that a defendant is allowed to file a special plea to suit its evidence to make effective a defense, that it was not in control of the instrumentality doing the injury nor the \u201csuperior\u201d who should respond for the negligence of a foreman in charge of the work, there being no surprise in permitting defendant\u2019s plea.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b628-15\" pgmap=\"628\">4.
