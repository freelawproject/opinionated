A declaration in a suit against a surety on a receiver\u2019s bond because of the failure of the receiver to pay a certain sum out of funds derived from rents- of certain premises is fatally defective, where there is no averment that the receiver ever had in his possession as receiver any rent whatever derived from the premises in question or any other funds from any source.</headnotes><attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b620-4\" pgmap=\"620\">Bither, Goff &amp; Francis, for plaintiff in error.</attorneys><attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b620-5\" pgmap=\"620\">George H.
