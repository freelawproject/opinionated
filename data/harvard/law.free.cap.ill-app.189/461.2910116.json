Anderson, defendant, to recover for personal injuries sustained by him on May 11, 1912, when, in endeavoring to'cross a public street in the city of Chicago he was struck by defendant\u2019s automobile. Plaintiff charged the negligent driving of the automobile at a high rate of speed. The place of the accident was a residential district of the city of Chicago.</p><p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b487-11\" pgmap=\"487\">From a judgment for seventy-five hundred dollars in favor of plaintiff, defendant appeals.</p><p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b487-12\" pgmap=\"487(26) 488(334)\">The evidence showed, without contradiction, that the accident happened about eight o\u2019clock in the evening; that at that time it was dark, was raining hard and there was a high wind; that the pavement on Washington boulevard is an asphalt pavement fifty feet in width; that just before the accident, plaintiff was walking north on the west sidewalk on 41st avenue with an umbrella over his head; that as he reached the end of the sidewalk at the curbstone on the south side of the boulevard pavement, he hesitated a moment, raised his umbrella, looked in both directions, \u201csaw nothing,\u201d and then started across at a \u201ctrot,\u201d or fast walk, holding his umbrella down over his head and shoulders; that at that moment, defendant\u2019s automobile, with two headlights and two oil lamps burning, came along the boulevard from the west at a rate of speed estimated by defendant\u2019s witnesses at from twenty-five to thirty-five miles an hour, and by plaintiff\u2019s witnesses at from thirteen to fifteen miles an hour; that as the automobile approached the intersection, the chauffeur saw plaintiff walking across, called out: \u201cHey, there,\u201d turned the front wheels to the north and applied the emergency brakes. The sudden locking of the rear wheels caused the automobile to \u201cskid\u201d around towards the south, and it \u201cskidded\u201d across the street intersection, turning \u2022 completely around, and finally came to a stop, facing southeast, at or near the curbstone at the northeast corner. As it whirled around, the right fender hit appellee, throwing him to the pavement. He fell on his back, face upward, and as the fender passed over him he took hold of it with both hands and held on until the automobile came to a stop. When he was pulled from under the machine his back was broken. The distance from the south curbstone to the point where appellee was struck by the automobile was approximately twenty-five feet, and while plaintiff was crossing this space at a fast walk or trot, the automobile traveled at least one hundred feet, if not twice or three times that far.</p><headnotes data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"APx\" pgmap=\"489\">Abstract of the Decision.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b489-7\" pgmap=\"489\">1.
