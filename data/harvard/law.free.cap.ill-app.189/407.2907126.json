Bierzynski, Francis Bierzynski and others who are dismissed from the case. All were members of a musical and dramatic organization called the \u201cLithuanian Youths\u2019 Circle.\u201d At one of its entertainments, appellee was on a committee that had charge of collecting the proceeds therefrom. At a later entertainment, he had charge of the wardrobe and collected the proceeds from the same. From the latter fund he retained the sum of $4.70, claiming that he overpaid the society that much from the proceeds of the first entertainment. A controversy and dispute over his right to the sum so retained having arisen in the society, it passed a resolution demanding it from him and threatening to publish his conduct in the newspapers if he did not pay it. In pursuance thereof an article, the original of which was signed by appellants, was published on May 5, 1911, in a Lithuanian paper and language, the translation of which is as follows:</p><p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b433-9\" pgmap=\"433(65) 434(179)\">\u201cOn the 29th of January of this year this Society played the play \u2018Valkata.\u2019 J. Szimkus, a member of this Society, was appointed in wardrobe, who charged 10 cents to each person for their clothing they left, but he kept the money, $4.70, himself. At first monthly meeting, after the play, he was asked for an explanation. J. Szimkus just told this much that he got the $4.70, but that he will not give it back. Violent uproar; J. Szimkus was asked if he cannot show for what reason he kept the money, and if he cannot show the reason he ought to return it to the Society Treasurer; but instead of that he said he would not belong to Society and went out. We will mention that this was not the first time that this happened with J. Szimkus. While he was organizing the Committee of this play, he used to give us an account in two or three months, but his account never used to agree with the sum of money which he used to turn in to Society, and he used to tell that he made mistakes in his account, or that he lost the money from his pocket.\" As he was of the same nationality, and a member of this Society, Society used to forgive him for a few dollars. The way he acted is very unfortunate. This Society is forced to let the public know about him.\u201d</p><p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b434-4\" pgmap=\"434\">The suit was commenced by filing a praecipe October 16, 1911, and issuance of summons on the same day. The declaration was filed September 18, 1912, consisting of one count, alleging .in due form that,by said article therein set forth it was intended to charge that plaintiff had \u201cfeloniously stolen and carried away certain moneys of said society,\u201d and claiming special damages to his reputation, credit and business.</p><p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b434-5\" pgmap=\"434\">Pursuant to an order entered October 8, 1912, an alias summons was issued and served on three of the defendants. All of them afterwards entered a general appearance and filed general and special demurrers, which were overruled, whereupon defendants filed pleas of not guilty, justification and the statute of limitations. A demurrer to the plea of statute of limitations was sustained. The verdict in favor of plaintiff was for fifteen hundred dollars, and there being a remittitur of three hundred dollars, judgment was entered tor twelve hundred dollars. To reverse the judgment, defendants appeal.</p><headnotes data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"Adi\" pgmap=\"435\">Abstract of the Decision.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b435-7\" pgmap=\"435\">1.
