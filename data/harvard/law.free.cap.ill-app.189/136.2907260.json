Fourteen persons were working on the sixth floor at the time the fire broke out, and eleven of them were killed. A number of suits were started against appellant as a result of the fire. One of them was decided by the Appellate Court in Hunt v. L. Fish Furniture Co., 187 Ill. App. 326. The statement of the court in the present case refers to the statement of facts in that case as serving the same office for the opinion in this case, so far as the evidence is concerned, on account of there being an agreement between counsel that the evidence in that case is substantially the same as in the case at bar. As the declarations in the two eases are not the same, that part of the said statement referring to the declaration may be disregarded.</p><attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b163-4\" pgmap=\"163\">Miller, Gorham &amp; Wales, for appellant.</attorneys><attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b163-5\" pgmap=\"163\">James L.
