Ripley and Augusta Hultman against Cross S. Farming Company, a corporation, and C. A. Philips to recover three hundred and sixty dollars paid on a contract for the conveyance of land and alleged to be due the plaintiffs for failure of defendants to comply with their oral agreement to improve the land.</p><p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b317-8\" pgmap=\"317(183) 318(96)\">The facts showed that the defendant Farming Company delivered to plaintiffs, in pursuance of previous verbal negotiations between the parties conducted for said Farming Company by C. A. Philips, a deed conveying to them eighteen acres of land in Texas at the price of one thousand and eighty dollars, three hundred and sixty dollars of which was paid in cash and three notes for two hundred and forty dollars each given for the remainder of the purchase price by the plaintiffs, payable to the Farming Company or order. The testimony of the plaintiffs was to the effect that the buyers of the lands in the section expected to sink a well for irrigation purposes at their own expense; that each purchaser was to pay in advance towards the expense of sinking such well four dollars per acre on the land bought by him, and the remainder of the expense was to be paid by the purchasers pro rata. Plaintiffs advanced to Philips seventy-two dollars, and took from him a receipt for said sum, \u201cto apply on the well to be drilled on Sec. 95 Cross S. Ranch, bal. of said well and outfit to be paid when well is completed.\u201d This receipt was given at the same time the deed was delivered. The deed recited the terms of the purchaser, acknowledged the receipt of three hundred and sixty dollars in money and three vendor\u2019s lien notes for two hundred and forty dollars each, and contained a general covenant of warranty. Philips returned to the plaintiffs the seventy-two dollars given to him by them to pay towards the cost of sinking a well.</p><headnotes data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"ASA\" pgmap=\"318\">Abstract of the Decision.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b318-10\" pgmap=\"318\">1.
