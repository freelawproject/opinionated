Nelson on a contract of guaranty to recover the unpaid balance due on certain notes. The facts showed that the defendant was president of a certain milling company which was indebted to the plaintiff upon an open account for materials sold and delivered; that the milling company ordered a carload of lumber from the plaintiff, but the plaintiff refused to fill the order before the old account was straightened up; that the defendant called at the plaintiff\u2019s office and an arrangement was made whereby the defendant, as its president, agreed to execute certain notes for the milling company, and also to personally guaranty their payment by letter if the plaintiff \u201cwould ship the carload of lumber or establish a credit to the milling company again as they were.\u201d</p><p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b67-10\" pgmap=\"67\">This proposition was consented to and the defendant so executed the notes and guaranty. A part of the notes were not fully paid at maturity and the plaintiff never performed its promises as agreed, and this suit was brought against defendant on his guaranty for the unpaid balance due on the notes.</p><p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b67-11\" pgmap=\"67(36) 68(84)\">The defendant filed an affidavit of merits stating that the guaranty was signed upon the representation that plaintiff would extend further credit to the maker of the notes, and would ship the lumber which had been ordered, but that after defendant had signed the guaranty \u2018 \u2018 the . plaintiff wholly refused to perform , and carry out its said agreement,\u201d whereby the consideration for the guaranty had\u2018 wholly failed. \u201d No counterclaim or set-off for damages arising out of a breach of plaintiff\u2019s promise was set up by defendant. Upon a trial by jury, the court directed a verdict in favor of plaintiff for $460.17. To reverse the judgment entered on the verdict, defendant prosecutes error.</p><headnotes data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b68-8\" pgmap=\"68\">Abstract of the Decision.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b68-9\" pgmap=\"68\">1.
