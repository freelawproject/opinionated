Wills, \u00a7 476<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014when legacy charged on real estate. A charge of a legacy upon real estate may he made by a testator, either by express directions to such effect contained in a will, or the intention thus to charge may be implied from the whole will taken together.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"AJLq\" pgmap=\"444\">2. Wills, \u00a7 479<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014when language sufficient to charge real estate with legacy. Where the testatrix gave her entire estate, both real and personal, to her children, less a- certain sum bequeathed to complainant, which she expressly directed should be deducted first out of her estate and the residue to be divided in equal parts between her children, it was the intent of the testatrix to charge her real estate as well as her personal property with the payment of the legacy to complainant.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"ATlQ\" pgmap=\"444\">3. Wills, \u00a7 480<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014when extrinsic evidence inadmissible. Where evidence was offered to show that at the time of the execution of a will, and for some time thereafter, the testatrix was the owner of personal property in excess of the amount necessary to pay her debts and a legacy in question, it was properly rejected as the intention to charge real estate with the payment of the legacy could be clearly gathered from the will itself.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"AV6u\" pgmap=\"444\">4. Wills, \u00a7 441<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014when a legacy begins to draw interest. A general pecuniary legacy draws interest from the time it is due and payable, which, when not fixed by the terms of the will, is one year .after the testator\u2019s death.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"A8EH\" pgmap=\"444\">5. Wills, \u00a7 441<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014payment of legacy. Where the personal estate was insufficient to pay a legacy, the residuary devisees and legatees took real estate burdened therewith and were liable for the interest on the legacy.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"AnU\" pgmap=\"444\">6. \"Costs, \u00a7 67<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014when statutory damages will not be added.
