Hassett for separate maintenance charging that complainant, without her fault, was compelled to live separate and apart from defendant because of his unkind, cruel and inhuman conduct. The defendant filed an answer denying the allegations of the bill and subsequently filed a cross-bill for divorce on the ground of desertion. To the cross-bill complainant filed her answer stating that she was compelled to leave defendant because of his treatment and his failure to support her. The chancellor dismissed both the original bill and the cross-bill for want of equity. To reverse the order, defendant appeals. .</p><attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b369-6\" pgmap=\"369\">Litzinger, McGurn &amp; Reid, for appellant.</attorneys><attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b369-7\" pgmap=\"369\">Percival Steele &amp; Albert H.
