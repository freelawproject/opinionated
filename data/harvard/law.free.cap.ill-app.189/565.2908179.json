In an action for damages to an automobile caused by a collision with a motor truck, statements made by servants of the defendant from two to five minutes after the collision occurred to the effect that the brakes of the motor truck were out of order and they could net stop it, that they had seen the driver of the plaintiff\u2019s automobile hold out his hand as a signal that he was going to turn, and that the motor truck was going at the rate of forty miles an hour, were merely narratives of completed past events and were not a part of the res gestae, and the admission of such statements as evidence was erroneous and prejudicial, the question as to negligence and contributory negligence being closely conflicting.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b592-9\" pgmap=\"592\">2.
