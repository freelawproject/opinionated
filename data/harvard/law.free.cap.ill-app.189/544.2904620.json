Appeal and error, \u00a7 474<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014when objection is necessary to preserve right of review.

In an action for alleged malpractice in extracting a tooth, whereby a fracture of the jaw resulted, the burden rested on the plaintiff to show want of care or skill in the treatment, and that the bad result following the treatment was the result of such want of care and skill, and no presumption that the defendant was unskilful or negligent would follow from the mere fact that the jaw was fractured and that the plaintiff was otherwise injured.</headnotes><p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b571-3\" pgmap=\"571\">Statement of the Case.</p><p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"ARbU\" pgmap=\"571\">Action on the case by Charles Blodgett against George W.
