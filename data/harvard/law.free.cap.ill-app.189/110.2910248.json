At' the end of the fourth count it used this language: \u201cAs will more fully appear from plaintiff\u2019s Exhibit \u2018A\u2019 and \u2018B\u2019 hereto attached.\u201d The affidavit of amount due stated that the demand of the plaintiff in the above entitled cause was for money due plaintiff for printing, and after allowing all just deductions and set-offs, there was due plaintiff $129.25. The exhibits \u201cA\u201d and \u201cB\u201d were designated city warrants Nos. 476 and 1367, being respectively for the sums of $15.30 and $113.95, both purporting to be signed by the mayor and clerk of the City of West Hammond and directed to the treasurer of the said city.</p><p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b137-4\" pgmap=\"137\">To this the defendant filed .a plea of general issue, and filed therewith an affidavit with reference to exhibit \u201cB\u201d which was for $113.95. This affidavit set up the fact that no appropriation had been made by the defendant, out of which payment could legally be made for the services and materials furnished the defendant, and for which plaintiff claims was issued the warrant designated as exhibit \u201cB;\" that neither the city council nor any officer or agent of defendant had any authority or power to incur any indebtedness for which no provision had been made in the Appropriation Ordinances of 1909 and 1910, being the period of time in which these services were rendered; and that no such fund as a general fund exists or ever existed. With reference to exhibit \u201cA,\u201d the affidavit set forth that the warrant was regular and was a binding obligation.</p><p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b137-5\" pgmap=\"137(162) 138(17)\">Plaintiff\u2019s evidence showed that its claim was for printing and advertising furnished from December 10, 1909 to December 8, 1910, in connection with certain local improvements and special assessments made in the City of West Hammond under the Local Improvement Act, J. &amp; A. \u00b6\u00b6 1388 et seq., that in each instance the requirement of the Local Improvement Act had been complied with and that the president and board of trustees of the village of West Hammond had passed an ordinance duly authorizing said improvements and special assessments, and providing therein for the payment of all advertisements out of the special assessment fund, the ordinances themselves being placed in evidence by plaintiff. It further appeared that the special assessments involved were passed between October, 1908 and May, 1910. The certificates of publication showing that the notice required to be given under the Local Improvement Act was published by plaintiff, were offered in evidence. It appeared that the only other evidence submitted by plaintiff in support of its case was exhibit \u201cB,\u201d which read as follows:</p><p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"Ac8\" pgmap=\"138\">\u201cNo. 1367 State of Illinois, Cook County.
