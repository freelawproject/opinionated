United States, 409 U.S. 352, 93 S.Ct. 595, 34 L.Ed.2d 568 (1973). We then recalled this court\u2019s judgment and remanded the cause to the District Court for reconsideration in the light of <em>Bronston. </em>The District Court did not disturb Cook\u2019s judgment of conviction, and a second appeal followed. On that appeal, we reversed Cook\u2019s conviction. 489 F.2d 286 (9th Cir. 1973). In that second, final decision, Judge Kilkenny, writing for the court, remarked that <em>Bronston </em>\u201cessentially, tracked the reasoning previously set forth . . . .\u201d in the dissenting opinion here published. We have therefore decided to direct the belated publication of the original opinions, believing that they, when reviewed in connection with <em>Bronston, </em>may be of some worth to those concerned with the law of perjury in the federal courts.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b825-7\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"755\">*755</page-number>Thomas P.

Cook, who had joined the police force in 1941, was an Assistant Chief of Police at the time of the grand jury\u2019s investigation, but he retired after the perjury indictment was filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-13\">The indictment charged that Cook had willfully given false testimony before the grand jury on February 25, 1970, when he testified in three particulars as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b825-14\">\u201c(a)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b825-15\">Q. Do you have any knowledge of law enforcement officers being paid by operators of gambling establishments?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AOB\">a. No, I do not.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b825-17\">(b)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b825-18\">Q. You don\u2019t have any knowledge of anybody currently on the force who participated in shakedowns ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b825-19\">A. I do not.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b825-20\">(c)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b825-21\">Q. Have you at any time received any money, property, or thing of value from any person direct or indirect, who has been involved in gambling activities ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b825-22\">A. No.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b825-23\">At the conclusion of the government\u2019s case, the trial judge dismissed the charge, insofar as it included item (c), for lack of sufficient convicting evidence. Hence, only the charges involving items (a) and (b) were submitted to the jury, whose general verdict read, \u201cWe the jury find the Defendant guilty as charged in the indictment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b825-24\">The prosecution established, in great volumes of direct testimony, that some policemen had taken payoffs from gambling establishments. The evidence with reference to Cook\u2019s knowledge of the payoffs was both direct and circumstantial. The appellee introduced testimony of business operators and owners who were victims of police shakedowns and of numerous policemen who participated in the payoff system. The system was described in detail, and the evidence leaves little room for doubt that there had been widespread corruption in the Seattle Police Department. Regarding Cook\u2019s alleged involvement, Police Major Jessup and Assistant Chief Fuller both testified that they discussed the existence and operation of the payoff system with Cook on separate occasions. Jessup also testified that he received monthly payments from Cook. Assistant Chief Corr testified that he had observed Cook surreptitiously receiving envelopes from others.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"756\">*756</page-number>In defense, Cook produced a dozen officers or former officers who testified that they did not have any knoweldge of policemen having been paid by gambling establishments and that they did not have any knowledge of officers currently on the force who had participated in shakedowns. In addition, Cook himself denied having had any personal knowledge of payoffs. Numerous character witnesses vouched for his veracity.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-4\">We shall discuss the assignments of error in the order outlined in appellant\u2019s brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-5\">CONSTITUTIONAL CHALLENGE.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-6\">We do not agree with Cook\u2019s argument that the questions upon which the charge is based are so \u201cindefinite, vague, and ambiguous\u201d as to require determination that the indictment itself is unconstitutionally vague. United States v. Marchisio, 344 F.2d 653, 661 (2d Cir. 1965). If there is vagueness in the term \u201cany knowledge,\u201d such is necessarily inherent. <em>Cf. </em>Gebhard v. United States, 422 F.2d 281, 287-288 (9th Cir. 1970). We hold that the phrases \u201cgambling establishment\u201d and \u201cbeing paid\u201d are common phrases used in everyday conversational intercourse and are neither indefinite, vague, nor ambiguous.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-7\">In what might be considered a collateral attack on the sufficiency of the indictment, appellant contends that the questions and answers to Items (a) and (b) were lifted out of context, as a result of which his answers were given erroneous meaning. He points out that following (a) and prior to (b), the following interchange occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b826-8\">\u201cQ. Do you have any knowledge of any law enforcement officers taking shakedown money?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b826-9\">A. In my twenty-nine years\u2019 experience I have had <em>some knowledge that these things have existed and as a result the people that were involved were separated from the Police Department.\u201d </em>(Emphasis supplied).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AHy\">Likewise, he charges that the indictment also omitted the following testimony given by appellant at the hearing in response to a question by a grand juror:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ay1\">\u201cGrand Juror: And you heard no scuttlebutt flying about payoffs at any time in the Department that you can recall?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b826-11\">The Witness: Yes. Yes, I have heard all kinds of rumors and I have heard much gossip, but, none, when I say no involvement, I mean that the investigation in any ease that I can recall, has been substantiated so far as these officers were concerned.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b826-12\">The factual background in Brown v. United States, 245 F.2d 549, 556 (8th Cir. 1957), upon which appellant relies is not sufficiently close to require comment. The failure to insert the missing questions and answers in the indictment did not give the answers to (a) and (b) \u201ca meaning wholly different\u201d from that which is manifest when they are read in the light of the omitted questions and answers. As we shall later mention, the issue of appellant\u2019s \u201cunderstanding\u201d was for the jury and they resolved it against him. The indictment was not inadequate as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-13\">SUFFICIENCY OF THE EVIDENCE</p>\n<p id=\"A1N\">As quoted above, the first question set forth in the indictment made inquiry as to whether Cook possessed \u201cany knowledge of law enforcement officers <em>being paid </em>by operators of gambling establishments.\u201d The question was asked on February 25, 1970. Cook argues that \u201cbeing paid\u201d refers to the present and that there was no evidence whatsoever that payments were being paid at or about the time of the inquiry. True enough, there is no evidence of payoffs after October 1, 1968. However, the question and answer must be read in the light of the nature of the investigation which was being conducted before the grand jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-14\">The record discloses that appellant was 56 years of age at the time of the trial in July, 1970. He graduated from an Oregon high school in June, 1930, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"757\">*757</page-number>and for the next eleven years followed a variety of occupations. In 1941, he applied for a position with the Seattle Police Department and out of a group of 1200 applicants was selected in the top 50. He then took a thirteen week course in the Police Academy and was assigned to the traffic division of the police force. For the next two years, he was a patrolman and was then assigned to the motorcycle enforcement division. In 1947, he took and passed the examination for the position of sergeant, then attended Northwestern University Traffic Institute in Chicago for a period of five months. In 1950, he was promoted to Captain. His principal duties were in the traffic investigation division. Following a year and a half serving in that capacity and acting as an expert witness in traffic eases, he was promoted to Supervising Captain, in which capacity he served until August, 1956. In the meantime, in 1952, he had taken an examination for the position of Chief of Police and had finished third. In 1956, he was named Chief of the Patrol Division. After a variety of assignments, he was appointed Chief of the Detective Division in 1965, and six months later was assigned to the position of Assistant Chief of Police. The primary responsibility of the Assistant Chief was to command the Patrol Division, in which capacity his major function was to supervise. In December, 1969, he was named Assistant Chief in charge of the Tactical Services Bureau.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-11\">Reading the record of appellant\u2019s testimony before the grand jury and at the trial, convinces us that appellant is a person of ordinary intelligence, at the very least, and probably, of superior intellect. We are convinced that he was fully and completely informed as to the nature of the grand jury hearing and knew, beyond question, that the grand jury was inquiring into police payoffs during the period some years prior to the grand jury inquiry in January and February, 1970.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Faced with this rec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"758\">*758</page-number>ord, appellant is in no position to say that he misunderstood the question and thought it was referring to the present, rather than the past. His long experience in the Police Department and overall demonstrated intelligence, precludes any misunderstanding as to the meaning of the indicated questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-4\">Appellant\u2019s contention that he may have misunderstood the question is strikingly similar to one urged by the appellant and resolved against him in Vitello v. United States, 425 F.2d 416, 420-421 (9th Cir. 1970), cert. denied 400 U.S. 822, 91 S.Ct. 43, 27 L.Ed.2d 50 (1970). Here, as distinguished from United States v. Lattimore, 127 F.Supp. 405 (D.D.C.1955), aff\u2019d 98 U.S.App.D.C. 77, 232 F.2d 334 (1955) and United States v. Wall, 371 F.2d 398, 400 (6th Cir. 1967), the appellant, in the context of the other questions propounded to him before the grand jury, could not have misunderstood the question. At <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"759\">*759</page-number>least, the issue on misunderstanding would be for the jury. The court carefully instructed the jury that one of the essential elements of the crime of perjury was proof by the government, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the testimony before the grand jury was false, and that such testimony was willfully given with specific intent to do something which the law forbids. The resolution of the issue was properly left to the jury. Essentially, the same type of issue was decided adversely to the appellant\u2019s contention in Vitello v. United States, <em>supra. </em>Needless to say, we are guided by the rule that on appeal the evidence must be viewed in the light most favorable to the government. Glasser v. United States, 315 U.S. 60, 80, 62 S.Ct. 457, 86 L.Ed. 680 (1942); United States v. Wilson, 447 F.2d 1, 3 (9th Cir. 1971); Kay v. United States, 421 F.2d 1007, 1010 (9th Cir. 1970). Additionally, all the reasonable inferences supporting the verdict are in favor of the government. Diaz-Rosendo v. United States, 357 F.2d 124, 129 (9th Cir. 1966), cert. denied 385 U.S. 856, 87 S.Ct. 104, 17 L.Ed.2d 83 (1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b829-5\">We note that the trial judge patiently instructed the jury as to the elements of the crime of perjury which had to be proven beyond a reasonable doubt before arriving at a guilty verdict. We also note that the judge just as carefully instructed the jury that they could find the appellant guilty or innocent on both items or could find appellant guilty on one item and not guilty on another. Similarly, he told the jury that before returning a verdict of guilty each juror had to agree thereto and that the verdict had to be unanimous. True enough, the judge did not separate the items in telling the jury that its verdict must be unanimous.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-6\">The comprehensive instructions of the judge consumed 26 pages of the transcript. The members were told, among other things, not to single out one instruction, but to consider the instructions as a whole. Pointedly similar instructions were before us in Vitello v. United States, <em>supra, </em>425 F.2d p. 422, where we said, \u201cImplicit in the instructions is a direction to the members of the jury that they could not return a verdict of guilty unless they were unanimous on one or more of the charges of falsity specified in the indictment. Under any reasonable rule of interpretation or construction applied to the instructions, the jury was told that appellant must be acquitted unless the government proved beyond a reasonable doubt to the entire jury that the appellant was guilty of perjury on at least one of the three charges set forth in the indictment.\u201d We shall later mention the authorities which require us to assume that the jury followed the instructions. In this case, if the jury performed its duty as stated in the instructions, it was required to be unanimous on the appellant\u2019s guilt. Under the instructions, the only manner in which the jury could arrive at an unanimous verdict was to find guilt beyond a reasonable doubt on one or more of the two items. Vitello resolves this issue against appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-8\">MATERIALITY ISSUE</p>\n<p id=\"b829-9\">Next, appellant contends that the trial court erred in instructing the jury on the subject of materiality. The trial judge held, as a matter of law, that the questions (a) and (b) were material to the subjects under investigation by the grand jury. Appellant suggests that the issue of materiality should have been submitted to the jury. This question was before us in Vitello v. United States, <em>supra, </em>pp. 423-424, and resolved against appellant. <em>Cf. </em>United States v. Tyrone, 451 F.2d 16 (9th Cir. 1971). Along the same line, appellant charges that the government completely failed to discharge its burden of proving materiality. The transcripts of the grand jury proceedings were before the trial court and are now before us. These transcripts make it crystal clear that the grand jury was making a general inves<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"760\">*760</page-number>tigation into gambling and racketeering in Seattle, Washington, and at the time appellant testified it was specifically concerned with an alleged system of payoffs and shakedown practices in which the Seattle Police Department had been involved. The procedure employed by the court is approved in Vitello v. United States, <em>supra, </em>as well as in United States v. Alu, 246 F.2d 29 (2d Cir. 1957). All that can be said of Sinclair v. United States, 279 U.S. 263, 49 S.Ct. 268, 73 L.Ed. 692 (1929) and Bowers v. United States, 92 U.S.App.D.C. 79, 202 F.2d 447 (1953), cited by appellant, is that they hold that materiality must be proved. Our review of the grand jury transcripts convinces us that the questions (a) and (b) were material to the scope of the grand jury investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-4\">The fact that the grand jury testimony in <em>Vitello </em>was accompanied by a stipulation that the transcript was to be accepted as true, is of no particular significance. Here, each of the grand jury transcripts is certified to by the court reporter, thus giving authenticity to the material examined <em>in camera </em>by the court. Additionally, Exhibit 1, a portion of the grand jury proceedings, is sufficient in itself to establish the materiality of questions (a) and (b) to the scope of the grand jury investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-5\">In passing, we note that appellant failed to take an exception to the instruction on materiality as required by Rule 30, F.R.Crim.P. This failure, in itself, would preclude us from considering this contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-11\">HEARSAY TESTIMONY</p>\n<p id=\"b830-12\">During the course of the trial, the court conditionally admitted certain hearsay testimony as to out-of-court statements and directives of other officers of the Seattle Police Department. Although the jury was cautioned again and again to disregard such hearsay, the appellant relying upon Krulewitch v. United States, 336 U.S. 440, 69 S.Ct. 716, 93 L.Ed. 790 (1949), and similar cases, argues that the cautionary instructions given to the jury before the conditional admission of hearsay and the later striking of the testimony \u201ccould not wipe clean the tarnished image of the defendant.\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-13\">On the occasions of the conditional admission of the hearsay, in each instance, the jury was cautioned and warned that the statements might later be stricken and should not be considered until the court eventually ruled on whether the hearsay was properly before them. Time after time during the course of the trial, the court warned the jury to disregard any hearsay testimony to which an objection had been taken. Later, in his final instructions the court repeatedly cautioned and warned the jury to disregard the hearsay.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b831-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"761\">*761</page-number><em>Krulewitch </em>is not in point. It did not involve stricken hearsay testimony, much less repeated warnings by the court that the jury should not consider the hearsay which had been stricken. Appellant\u2019s other cases are no more in point. Under the circumstances of this case and, in particular, in the light of the court\u2019s repeated instructions to disregard the hearsay evidence, we are required to assume that the jury followed the instructions and did not willfully disobey them. Vitello v. United States, <em>supra, </em>425 F.2d p. 421; United States v. Friedman, 445 F.2d 1076, 1083 (9th Cir. 1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b831-5\">INSTRUCTION ON RIGHT OF APPEAL</p>\n<p id=\"b831-6\">Next, appellant argues that the trial court should not have told the jury that, \u201cIf the defendant is guilty, there can always be an appeal\u201d or that, \u201cThe Court can make an error, those errors are usually corrected by an appellate court if they have been damaging in any way.\u201d While we do not approve the giving of such instructions, United States v. Workman, 454 F.2d 1124, 1129 (9th Cir. 1972), appellant is in no position to complain. It is well settled in this circuit that if an objection is not made at the time that we will not invoke the plain error provisions of Rule 52(b), F.R.Crim.P., except in the very exceptional situation wherein it appears to be necessary in order to prevent a miscarriage of justice or to preserve the integrity and reputation of the judicial process. United States v. Bacall, 443 F.2d 1050, 1063 (9th Cir. 1971); Marshall v. United States, 409 F.2d 925, 927 (9th Cir. 1969). Here, we do not believe that the remarks of the court resulted in a miscarriage of justice or, in any manner, invaded the integrity or reputation of the judicial process. It is \u00e1 general principle that counsel cannot remain silent, interpose no objection, and after verdict raise for the first time a claim that comments were improper and prejudicial. United States v. Cozzetti, 441 F.2d 344, 352 (9th Cir. 1971); Ignacio v. People of Territory of Guam, 413 F.2d 513, 520-521 (9th Cir. 1969), cert. denied 397 U.S. 943, 90 S.Ct. 959, 25 L.Ed.2d 124 (1970). True enough, these cases involved remarks by counsel, rather than the court. In the circumstances presented, we find no logical reason why the rule should not be applied to the court\u2019s remarks. United States v. Workman, <em>supra, </em>454 F.2d pp. 1124, 1127; United States v. Allen, 431 F.2d 712, 713 (9th Cir. 1970); Duran v. United States, 413 F.2d 596, 600 (9th Cir. 1969); Carroll v. United States, 326 F.2d 72, 82 (9th Cir. 1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b831-11\">EMPLOYMENT OF GEBHARD RULE</p>\n<p id=\"b831-12\">Traditionally, because of a need to encourage potential witnesses to testify freely and willingly, witnesses have been afforded protection from unfounded perjury prosecutions by the imposition of a more stringent requirement of proof commonly known as the \u201ctwo witness rule\u201d.<footnotemark>2a</footnotemark> For example, Weiler v. United States, 323 U.S. 606, 608-609, 65 S.Ct. 548, 89 L.Ed. 495 (1945). Properly stated, the rule is that the uncorroborated oath of one witness is not enough to establish, for the purposes of conviction of perjury, the falsity of sworn testimony. Recently, our court recognized the practical difficulty of proving perjury under the traditional rule when the alleged falsity was lodged in the belief, memory or knowledge of the accused and permitted proof of guilt in such cases by circumstantial evidence. Gebhard v. United States, 422 F.2d 281 (9th Cir. 1970). The judge here in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"762\">*762</page-number>structed the jury in accordance with the law as stated in <em>Gebhard </em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"Apbx\">Appellant argues: (1) that we overrule <em>Gebhard </em>and hold that circumstantial evidence of knowledge is insufficient, or (2) that we distinguish <em>Gebhard </em>by saying that the indictment there before the court included 32 different counts, while here, we have one count with two items and that the court indiscriminately applied the so-called two witness rule and the circumstantial evidence rule to both items. We decline the invitation to overrule <em>Gebhard </em>and confess our inability to distinguish it on the grounds urged by counsel. Here, the court in its instructions made it abundantly clear that the crime stated in Item (a) was entirely separate and distinct from that stated in Item (b). Likewise, the court emphasized that the <em>Gebhard </em>circumstantial evidence rule applied only to the charge in Item (a), in which the issue of knowledge was presented. The court\u2019s <em>Gebhard </em>instruction is not vulnerable to attack.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-4\">KNOWLEDGE INSTRUCTION</p>\n<p id=\"b832-5\">Appellant quibbles about the failure of the court to give his requested instruction on \u201cknowledge\u201d. The court\u2019s instruction on knowledge consisted of 20 lines and over 110 words. The instruction, in our view, adequately covered everything requested in appellant\u2019s request. While the language of the last paragraph of the instruction might be more precisely employed, we feel that when it is read in context with the other instructions on the same subject, it measures up to the requirements stated in United States v. Lattimore, <em>supra. </em>In any event, appellant\u2019s requested instruction is no more enlightening than that given by the court. Besides that, appellant failed to object to that portion of the instructions of which he now complains. Rule 30, F.R.Crim.P., precludes him from now asserting error.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-8\">We suspect that Brother Ely\u2019s continuing assault on the probity of circumstantial evidence as stated in United States v. Nelson, 419 F.2d 1237 (9th Cir. 1969) , is again reflected in the views so dramatically expressed in his exhaustive dissent. See United States v. Brown, 454 F.2d 397, 399 (9th Cir. 1972). Beyond question, <em>Nelson </em>precluded the trial judge from giving certain of the instructions requested by appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-10\">Our review of the record convinces us that the appellant had a fair trial and that the judgment of the trial court must be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-11\">It is so ordered.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b827-5\">. \u201cMR.

There is a tolerance policy in practically every phase of enforcement. As you, I am sure, are aware, it is impossible to enforce every law to its ultimate. Take the speed law, for instance, on a street where the speed is 30 miles an hour. We do not enforce it at 31 miles an hour. I myself drive to work on a 30-mile an hour street and the average speed on that street is 35 miles an hour, and no tickets are given. There is a level of enforcement in every area. You are interested in gambling, of course, and in this area the level of enforcement is set by the mayor, city council, and probably basically by the people of the community, and what they insist is the level of enforcement that they want. This is as I understand it.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b827-12\">\u201cQ. <em>What was the policy with particular reference to pinballs and cardrooms, private clubs, punchboards, bingo raffles?

Of course, to gamble in your own home, to play penny ante, poker, or to play bridge for a quarter of a cent a point or a tenth of a cent a point, this is gambling, course, too, and in those areas, although they are not licensed, of course, we believe that it would be unreasonable to try to take enforcement action and we just don\u2019t have that many police officers.

While my Brothers and I disagree on numerous specific issues, my principal difficulty with the majority opinion concerns its approach which, as I see it, is insensitive to the delicate nature of a perjury prosecution and dangerously unrestrietive of the pervasive impact of Gebhard v. United States, 422 F.2d 281 (9th Cir. 1970) . By isolating each of Cook\u2019s contentions without regard to its inherent relationship with the others, my Brothers issue an opinion that is fraught with distressing inconsistencies.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-15\">A perjury trial is not an ordinary criminal prosecution. The crime is unique in that perjury, unlike offenses such as robbery, arson, or murder, lacks an objectively demonstrable <em>actus reus. </em>Since the gravamen of the offense lies in the calculating utterance of testimony <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"763\">*763</page-number>known by the actor to be false, the elements of <em>actus reus </em>and <em>mens rea </em>converge in a prosecution that focuses solely upon the person and character of the accused. This uniqueness has been recognized by the courts in fashioning rules of law peculiar to perjury prosecutions.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The \u2019 time-honored application of the \u201ctwo witness rule,\u201d for example, has shrouded perjury trials with an aura of solemnity exceeded only by prosecutions for treason, the only other modern crime in which a quantitative rule of evidence is applied. <em>See </em>Weiler v. United States, 323 U.S. 606, 608-609, 65 S.Ct. 548, 89 L.Ed. 495 (1945); 7 Wigmore on Evidence \u00a7\u00a7 2036-2041 (3d ed. 1940).</p>\n<p id=\"b833-5\">Cook was not accorded the full benefit of the protection generally afforded by the \u201ctwo witness\u201d rule, however, because this case was submitted to the jury in accordance with the recently announced holding of our court in <em>Gebhard, supra, </em>permitting proof of the subjective falsity of allegedly perjured statements by circumstantial evidence. While <em>Gebhard </em>adequately indicates <em>when </em>the traditional \u201ctwo witness\u201d rule will give way to allow proof of perjury by circumstantial evidence, that case does not explicitly explain the <em>effect </em>of so relaxing the proof requirement. The pervasive impact of <em>Gebhard </em>upon the whole trial cannot be overlooked. If the circumstantial evidence offered by the prosecution in this trial were excised from the record, the transcript, in all probability, would shrink to less than one-half of its present 2,000 pages. While I recognize the pragmatic reasons leading to our adoption of the circumstantial evidence rule in <em>Gebhard, </em>I cannot believe that the <em>Gebhard </em>court intended to impinge upon the traditionally exalted rights of one accused of perjury by sanctioning that alternate mode of proof. The clearest indication of the lack of any such intention appears in <em>Gebhard </em>itself, for the court there, upon its own initiative, enlarged upon the rights of one accused of perjury, extending protection to the interrogation stage of the proceedings and imposing restraint on the Government in framing an indictment. <em>See </em>422 F.2d at 289-290.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b833-10\">The teaching of <em>Gebhard, </em>therefore, is that the relaxation of the strict proof requirement is to be offset by increased vigilance on the part of the courts and the imposition of higher scruples on the prosecution. These measures are necessary to guard against the temptation to erode other safeguards erected for the protection of one accused of perjury, under the guise of merely facilitating proof of the offense. Unfortunately, I fear that my Brothers have fallen prey to that temptation, for my review of the record convinces me that, despite extremely conscientious efforts on the part of the trial judge, Cook did not receive a fair trial.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b834-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"764\">*764</page-number>I shall discuss my intense disagreement with the majority opinion under separate headings.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-4\">I. AMBIGUITY IN THE INDICTMENT.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-5\">The majority recognizes that the term \u201cany knowledge\u201d is vague, and the trial court\u2019s attempted definition of the phrase indicates the variety of meanings to which the expression may be subjected.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Moreover, as I discuss in greater detail below,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> the question set forth as item (a) of the indictment is so ambiguous that Cook could have been subjected to this prosecution regardless of his response to that query.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-6\">I do not think it proper to indict and prosecute an individual for perjury when the questions forming the basis of the charge are so vaguely and inarticulately phrased <em>by the interrogator </em>as to require the jury to probe the inner workings of the accused\u2019s mind to seek to ascertain which of several plausible meanings he attributed to the ambiguous inquiries when he gave the allegedly perjurious responses. The patent vagueness of the present indictment, therefore, does present a defect of constitutional dimension.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b834-7\">\u201cWhen elements in an indictment are so easily subject to divergent interpretation, the accused is not adequately apprised of the charges as to enable him to prepare a defense. It therefore fails to conform to the requirements of the Sixth Amendment and Federal Rules [Rule 7(c), Fed.R.Crim.P.].\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b834-16\">United States v.

LIFTING STATEMENTS OUT OF CONTEXT.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-18\">A careful review of the record and relevant decisions convinces me that either there is merit in Cook\u2019s contention concerning the lifting of his statements out of context or the majority has implicitly overruled that portion of Gebhard v. United States, 422 F.2d 281, 289-290 (9th Cir. 1970), wherein our court condemned the practice of bludgeoning \u201ca witness who is lying by repeating and rephrasing the same question, thus creating more possible perjury counts.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b834-19\">The majority recognizes the well established rule that \u201ca charge of perjury may not be sustained by the device of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"765\">*765</page-number>lifting a statement of the accused out of its immediate context and thus giving it a meaning wholly different than that which its context clearly shows.\u201d Fotie v. United States, 137 F.2d 831, 842 (8th Cir. 1943); <em>accord, </em>Van Liew v. United States, 321 F.2d 674, 677-678 (5th Cir. 1963); Brown v. United States, 245 F.2d 549, 556 (8th Cir. 1957); United States v. Geller, 154 F.Supp. 727, 730 n. 3 (S.D.N.Y.1957); <em>cf. </em>United States v. Norris, 300 U.S. 564, 576, 57 S.Ct. 535, 81 L.Ed. 808 (1937).</p>\n<p id=\"b835-5\">I strongly disagree with the holding of the majority that this rule is inapplicable to the present case. While I recognize that the facts of the subject case are distinguishable from those of one of the cases in which the \u201cout of context\u201d rule was applied, Brown v. United States, <em>supra, </em>I do not believe that that circumstance suffices as a reason for refusing to apply the rule here. For when the application of the standard in other cases is examined, it becomes obvious that the purpose of the rule would be furthered by applying it to the facts before us. For example, in Van Liew v. United States, <em>supra, </em>the court concluded that when a question and answer in the indictment were read in context, the testimony of the accused would have to be construed as referring to a single phase of a manufacturing process, not to the entire process as the Government had there attempted to establish by lifting the question and answer out of context. Likewise, when Cook\u2019s allegedly perjurious statements are read in context with the remainder of his testimony before the grand jury, it is evident that he did not deny \u201cany knowledge\u201d whatsoever, of the illicit practices. He forthrightly admitted in testimony omitted from the indictment, that he had acquired \u201csome knowledge\u201d and had heard \u201crumors\u201d and \u201cgossip\u201d concerning police involvement in the payoff system.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-6\">Unlike my Brothers, therefore, I perceive a material difference between an apparently unqualified denial of \u201cany knowledge,\u201d and a denial coupled with an explanation of the extent of one\u2019s \u201cknowledge.\u201d In the present case, the defectiveness in the indictment is all the more egregious in light of the misdirection of the jury as to the manner in which the term \u201cknowledge\u201d should be interpreted.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b835-8\">What is even more disturbing to me, however, is that the majority, in reaching its conclusion, seems to ignore the effect of its decision on this court\u2019s prior holding in Gebhard v. United States, 422 F.2d 281, 289-290 (9th Cir. 1970). During the grand jury proceedings, Cook was asked a sequence of three questions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b835-9\">\u201cQ. Do you have any knowledge of law enforcement officers being paid by operators of gambling establishments ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b835-10\">A. No, I do not.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b835-11\">Q. Do you have any knowledge of any law enforcement officers taking shakedown money?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b835-12\">A. In my twenty-nine years\u2019 experience I have had some knowledge that these things have existed and as a result the people that were involved were separated from the Police Department.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b835-13\">Q. You don\u2019t have any knowledge of anybody currently on the force who participated in shakedowns?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b835-14\">A. I do not.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b835-15\">As I read these queries they are redundant. The first and second questions are, for all practical purposes, identical. In addition, the third question merely asks Cook to repeat his previous response. In the indictment, however, Cook was charged with having committed perjury only with respect to the first and third of his responses.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-16\">While I realize that it is not our function to question the Government\u2019s motives in framing an indictment, I can perceive of no valid reason why the see<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"766\">*766</page-number>ond question and answer were deleted from the indictment here.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b836-4\">\u201c[I]t is better practice, both from the standpoint of the Government and the defendant, to set forth enough of the testimony immediately before and after the alleged false statements to give some coherent context to the alleged false statements.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b836-5\">Stassi v. United States, 401 F.2d 259, 262 (5th Cir. 1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b836-6\">It would be utterly unreasonable to assume that the Government felt that Cook had not perjured himself with respect to the omitted testimony, since it was entirely consistent with the other responses for which he was indicted. It is more likely that the Government was concerned that the inclusion of this question and answer in the indictment would weaken its case by giving a different connotation to the questions and answers that were included in the indictment. Yet if this were so, then my above conclusion as to the applicability of the \u201cout of context\u201d rule could not logically be challenged. Assuming, <em>arguendo, </em>that the majority has properly concluded that Cook\u2019s statements were not improperly lifted out of context, then the only possible remaining explanation for the omission of the intervening exchange is that the Government framed the indictment so as to avoid the appearance of attempting to circumvent Gebhard v. United States, <em>supra. </em>If that consideration did motivate the Government, then, I submit, only the majority has been hoodwinked:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b836-7\">\u201c[Tjhere is a defect . . . which appears on the face of the indictment. . [W]e do not think it proper that the government bludgeon a witness who is lying by repeating and rephrasing the same question, thus creating more possible perjury counts.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AiH\"><em>Id., </em>at 289-290.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-11\"><em>Gebhard </em>makes it clear that the mere <em>asking </em>of' .repetitive questions is the practice condemned. While a distinction could be urged that the Government in <em>Gebhard </em>was only precluded from premising additional counts of perjury upon reiterated or rephrased questions, I do not believe that the evident error in this case can be avoided by the Government\u2019s action in omitting one offending question from the indictment and charging Cook in only one count of perjury. The <em>Gebhard </em>court emphasized that the damage this rule is designed to prevent occurs when an interrogator is allowed to hammer away at a witness, \u201cthus creating more <em>possible </em>perjury counts,\u201d necessarily enabling the prosecution to choose the most detrimental responses to identical questions as the bases for a charge of perjury.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-12\">The \u201cbludgeoning\u201d prohibition, therefore, is not unlike the \u201cout of context\u201d rule.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Both proscriptions are directed at insuring that allegedly perjurious statements included within an indictment accurately reflect the testimony of the accused. This objective, in my opinion, has not been accomplished in the present case. The questions included in the indictment reflect a perversion of both Cook\u2019s testimony and the interrogation process; hence, I would hold that the indictment is defective.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-13\">III. SUFFICIENCY OF THE EVIDENCE.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-14\">The first question set forth in the indictment made inquiry as to whether Cook possessed \u201cany knowledge of law enforcement officers <em>being paid </em>by operators of gambling establishments.\u201d Cook was asked this question on February 25, 1970. Yet there was no evidence whatsoever that the alleged payments were being made at or about that time. To the contrary, the record very clearly establishes, and the majority appears to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"767\">*767</page-number>recognize, that the payments had ceased approximately two years before the critical question was asked.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-4\">If as Cook contends, the participial phrase \u201cbeing paid\u201d must be construed as referring to an ongoing activity, then the evidence was insufficient to support Cook\u2019s conviction on the basis of the question and answer first specified in the indictment. In light of the following authoritative definition and explanation of participial usage, I must agree with Cook:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b837-5\">\u201cpar'ti.ci.ple . . . <em>Gram. </em>A word that partakes of the nature of both verb and adjective; a verbal adjective, modifying a noun, but sharing the adjuncts and construction of the verb from which it is derived. The English verb has two participles: (1) the <em>present, </em>ending in <em>-ing </em>(hastily <em>writing </em>it down, he paused); (2) the <em>perfect, </em>ending for the most part in <em>-ed, -d, -t, -en, </em>or <em>-n </em>(I saw the note <em>written </em>and <em>posted). </em>These tense forms refer to the <em>state </em>of the action or occurrence as in progress or complete, rather than to its <em>time of happening, </em>which depends on the time expressed by the verb of the clause it occurs in (he climbed the stairs, <em>smiling </em>to himself, \u2014 in which sentence <em>smiling </em>refers to the same time as <em>climbed). </em>English participles and their phrases show the following characteristic distinctions of time reference and voice:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b837-7\">TIME DISTINCTIONS</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AY7\">ACTIVE VOICE</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AxZ\">PASSIVE VOICE</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ABI\">\n<em>Present</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A0h\">\n<em>(progressive (perfect</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AAtr\">writing arrived</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AqNt\">being written written</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ARN2\">\n<em>Past</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AFT\">\n<em>(progressive (perfect</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Afx\">having written</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ax-\">having been written</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ALqI\">\n<em>Perfect</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AbC\">having been</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AMz\">\n<em>progressive</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AqI\">writing\"</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b837-19\">Webster\u2019s New International Dictionary 1782 (2d ed. 1940).</p>\n<p id=\"b837-20\">Since it is virtually impossible to determine from the jury\u2019s general verdict whether Cook\u2019s conviction was based upon either item (a) or item (b) of the indictment, or both, Cook is entitled to a new trial. <em>See </em>Yates v. United States, 354 U.S. 298, 311-312, 77 S.Ct. 1064, 1 L.Ed.2d 1356 (1957); Vitello v. United States, 425 F.2d 416, 419 (9th Cir.), cert. denied, 400 U.S. 822, 91 S.Ct. 43, 27 L.Ed.2d 50 (1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b837-22\">As I read the majority opinion, three theories are relied upon to refute my conclusion. First, the majority makes the somewhat astounding assertions that, in light of the nature of the grand jury investigation, the disputed question should be viewed as an inquiry into past events, arid that because of his \u201csuperior intellect,\u201d Cook \u201cis in no position to say that he <em>misunderstood </em>the question and thought it was referring to the present\u201d (emphasis added). If, as my Brothers contend, the question must be read in context to ascertain its true meaning, then it would seem obvious that the query was improperly lifted out of context and given a wholly different meaning when it was included in the indictment. This inconsistency is a minor consideration for, as even a standard dictionary demonstrates, the only proper interpretation of question (a) is that it constitutes an inquiry into events in progress at the time it was asked. The use of the participial phrase \u201cbeing paid\u201d in conjunction with the verb \u201chave\u201d reveals that the interrogator could only have been eliciting Cook\u2019s knowledge concerning payments that were being made on or about February 25, 1970. The interrogator revealed in his other questioning that he was sufficiently familiar with English grammar to articulate inquiries into past transactions properly and unambiguously in the past tense.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In addition, several of the questions posed to Cook did inquire as to his knowledge concerning present practices, and these queries were phrased correctly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"768\">*768</page-number>in the present tense.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Hence, it is only if Cook \u201cmisunderstood\u201d the question that he could have considered it an inquiry into past events.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-4\">Perhaps the most persuasive indication of the indefensibility of the majority\u2019s position is the simple fact that had Cook responded to the question in the affirmative, there could have been no doubt, in light of the uncontroverted evidence that the payments had ceased, that such an answer would have been false. Cook was indeed \u201cup the creek\u201d without any semblance of a paddle when posed this question, for regardless of his response, he was subjecting himself to a perjury prosecution. I would not be surprised to find the majority\u2019s opinion cited in the future as authority for the proposition that an unequivocal \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d response to any question in the course of grand jury proceedings presents a jury question as to the perjurious nature of the reply.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-5\">I cannot join the majority\u2019s distortion of the English language, nor can I conceal my concern over what I view as a lack of recognition of the unique nature of the offense of perjury. If there be any \u201cmisunderstanding\u201d as to the meaning of the phrase \u201cbeing paid,\u201d it is one shared only by the interrogator, the Government, and the majority. I cannot uphold a conviction for perjury which was quite likely premised upon the Government agent\u2019s lack of \u201cknowledge\u201d concerning proper English usage.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b838-15\">I am equally troubled by the majority\u2019s second basis for its inexplicable conclusion that no reversible error occurred, <em>i.e., </em>that the issue of Cook\u2019s misunderstanding was, in any event, for the jury to resolve. My principal objection to that theory is that I can not believe that the disputed phrase is susceptible to being interpreted as merely an inarticulate inquiry into past events. However, even if I were willing to join in the speculation that \u201cbeing paid\u201d could be so construed, I could not alter my conclusion as to the sufficiency of the evidence. The burden was on the prosecution, and it did not, and apparently could not, produce adequate evidence that Cook interpreted the question in a manner inconsistent with proper English usage.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b838-16\">\u201cIn a ease where the question propounded admits of several plausible meanings, the defendant\u2019s belief cannot be adequately tested and it is nec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"769\">*769</page-number>essary to determine what the question meant to him when he gave the disputed answer. United States v. Lattimore, 127 F.Supp. 405 (D.C.D.C.1955), aff\u2019d, 98 U.S.App.D.C. 77, 232 F.2d 334 (1955).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b839-5\">\u201cThere was no evidence to show what the question meant to Mrs. Wall when she answered it. In the absence of such evidence, no determination could be made as to the falsity of her answer. The evidence was insufficient to support the conviction. The District Court erred in denying the motion for judgment of acquittal.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b839-6\">United States v. Wall, 371 F.2d 398, 400 (6th Cir. 1967). Hence, a jury question had never properly matured.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-7\">The majority, therefore, cannot seriously contend that the prosecution\u2019s evidence was sufficient to support Cook\u2019s conviction with respect to item (a) of the indictment. Apparently recognizing the dearth of reason supporting the two theories discussed above, my Brothers advance a third ground for rejecting Cook\u2019s contention \u2014 the applicability of Vitello v. United States, 425 F.2d 416 (9th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>400 U.S. 822, 91 S.Ct. 43, 27 L.Ed.2d 50 (1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b839-8\">The relationship between <em>Vitello </em>and Cook\u2019s claim concerning the sufficiency of the prosecution\u2019s evidence is not readily apparent. The nexus becomes evident, however, when the following language from <em>Vitello </em>is examined:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b839-9\">\u201cIn <em>Yates, </em>the court submitted to the jury two overt acts, including an overt act which had been barred by the California statute of limitations. Since there was no way of knowing whether the jury based its verdict upon the barred act, or the other alternative, the Supreme Court reversed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b839-10\">\u201cFor the purposes of this decision, we accept appellant\u2019s view of the effect of <em>Yates, </em>and that the teaching of that decision should be here applied if we find (1) that there was insufficient evidence to be submitted to the jury on any one or more of the specifications of falsity. . . . \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b839-12\">425 F.2d at 419. The majority, therefore, seems compelled to hold the evidence sufficient with respect to item (a) so that it can invoke the holding in <em>Vitello, </em>concerning the jury\u2019s supposed prowess at divining the correct rule of law from nonexistent instructions, to cure the obvious error specified by the majority as the trial court\u2019s failure to \u201cseparate the items in telling the jury that its verdict must be unanimous.\u201d I see the utilization of two unsound theories as a weak foundation for the majority\u2019s application of the <em>Vitello </em>holding.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-13\">I harbor a more fundamental objection to the majority\u2019s application of <em>Vitello </em>to the present ease. While I still entertain my doubts concerning the correctness of the reasoning employed by my Brothers in <em>Vitello, see </em>425 F.2d at 425-426 (dissenting opinion), I recognize that I am bound by the decision of the majority in that case. Nonetheless, I am convinced that our present case is significantly distinguishable from <em>Vitello.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b839-14\">My Brothers are most surely aware that we here have a somewhat unique situation for a perjury case. They recognize that the indictment is permeated with ambiguity and that the prosecution\u2019s case was based primarily upon circumstantial evidence. The true significance of these factors has, however, been overlooked by the majority. Since these factors have hitherto been considered by our court only in isolation, <em>compare </em>Vitello v. United States, <em>supra </em>(ambiguity in indictment), with Gebhard v. United States, <em>supra </em>(circumstantial evidence rule), their confluence here obviously sets Cook\u2019s case apart from other perjury trials that we have reviewed.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-15\">The importance of recognizing the impact of the <em>Gebhard </em>circumstantial evidence rule is easily demonstrated. When a unanimous panel of this court adopted the circumstantial evidence rule in <em>Gebhard, </em>it apparently recognized that substantial rights of the accused had been impaired thereby, and thus proceeded to fashion the aforementioned <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"770\">*770</page-number>\u201cbludgeoning\u201d prohibition. I reemphasize the fact that when Congress recently abrogated the traditional \u201ctwo witness\u201d rule as previously applied in some circumstances, it too was careful to afford countervailing protection to a perjury suspect by prescribing the defense of recantation. <em>See </em>note 2, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b840-4\">Since, as I demonstrate in Part VI, <em>infra, </em>my Brothers misconstrue the applicability of the <em>Gebhard </em>circumstantial evidence rule in the one instance in which they discuss it, it is understandable that they would also incorrectly characterize my concern over the impact of <em>Gebhard </em>on Cook\u2019s trial as an \u201cassault on the probity of circumstantial evidence.\u201d I do not, and logically could not, object to Cook\u2019s being deprived of the full benefit of the \u201ctwo witness\u201d rule. Nor do I question the reliability of the circumstantial evidence offered by the Government. I merely think it is important to recognize that <em>Gebhard </em>represents a departure from the traditional method of proof allowed in a perjury case, and that in cases in which <em>Gebhard </em>applies, we are under a duty, as exemplified by the prior actions of our court and the Congress, zealously to protect the accused\u2019s remaining rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-5\">We need not go so far as the court in <em>Gebhard </em>or the Congress. We need only strictly enforce Cook\u2019s right that his guilt should be determined by unanimous agreement of the jurors. On the record before us, there is no indication that Cook was so convicted, for, as the majority recognizes, \u201cthe judge did not separate the items in telling the jury that its verdict must be unanimous.\u201d Neither the court\u2019s instructions nor the general form of the jury\u2019s verdict excludes the possibility that Cook\u2019s conviction resulted from an impermissible \u201ccombination of jurors' opinions.\u201d Vitello v. United States, <em>supra </em>at 426 (dissenting opinion). The majority\u2019s only response to my conclusion is the speculation that the jurors must have been unanimous in light of the prior holding in <em>Vitello. </em>Yet Cook\u2019s trial differs substantially from Vitello\u2019s in that the degree of precision afforded by adherence to the \u201ctwo witness\u201d rule was here lacking. I believe that <em>Gebhard </em>commands us to insure that a similar degree of precision pervades all perjury trials, whether or not the \u201ctwo witness\u201d rule is applied. Cook\u2019s conviction should be reversed, if for no other reason, because of the deficiency in the court\u2019s instructions concerning required juror unanimity.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-7\">IV. HEARSAY TESTIMONY.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-8\">Cook has catalogued numerous examples of hearsay evidence which were admitted over objection, the most damaging of which, ultimately stricken, were admitted conditionally for the limited purpose of showing a conspiracy in the police department to maintain the payoff system. The trial court concluded, however, that no conspiracy had been proved, and thus instructed the jurors to disregard the inadmissible testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-9\">I strongly disagree with the majority\u2019s determination that Krulewitch v. United States, 336 U.S. 440, 69 S.Ct. 716, 93 L.Ed. 790 (1949), is not applicable. The observations of Mr. Justice Jackson concerning the \u201cconspiracy\u201d offense, <em>id. </em>at 445-448, 69 S.Ct. 716 (concurring opinion), are especially apposite in the context of the instant case \u2014 a perjury trial under <em>Gebhard, supra, </em>wherein the accused, lacking the mantle of protection generally afforded him by the \u201ctwo witness\u201d rule, is confronted with damaging hearsay evidence, admitted under an unsupportable theory of conspiracy. In my opinion, the injection of \u201cconspiracy\u201d into Cook\u2019s trial is a factor which must be considered in assessing the prejudicial effect of this testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-10\">I also deem it significant that portions of the inadmissible testimony are present in the testimony of Fuller, Jessup, and Corr, who were among the few prosecution witnesses to testify as to direct dealings with Cook that would tend to implicate him in the payoff system. The trial court did not read the stricken <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"771\">*771</page-number>testimony to the jury because of his fear that such action would \u201caggravate\u201d the situation with respect to that evidence;<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> hence, I believe the majority\u2019s assumption that the jury could sift through the mass of testimony and \u201cforget\u201d the hearsay portions is wholly unwarranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-4\">I am therefore unable to agree with my Brothers that the trial court\u2019s instructions to disregard this virulent testimony were sufficient to accomplish that goal. The testimony was simply too pervasive, and the resultant prejudice to Cook too damaging for the harm to be obliterated by any number of instructions. <em>See, e. g., </em>Odom v. United States, 377 F.2d 853, 859-860 (5th Cir. 1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b841-5\">V. INSTRUCTIONS ON RIGHT OF APPEAL.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-6\">The majority has quoted portions of the statements by the trial judge wherein he delineated the parties\u2019 respective rights to appeal, and intimated that any errors could be cured by an appellate court.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Under normal circumstances, I would agree with the majority that these remarks, when read in context, do not rise to the level of \u201cplain error.\u201d Rule 52(b), Fed.R.Crim.Proc. As I have repeatedly emphasized, however, this is not a \u201cnormal\u201d case.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-7\">In light of the serious nature of the offense of perjury and the peculiar eircumstances of the present prosecution, I believe we must recognize that these remarks do impinge upon \u201cthe integrity and reputation of the judicial process.\u201d <em>See </em>People v. Morse, 60 Cal.2d 631, 36 Cal.Rptr. 201, 388 P.2d 33 (1964), cited with approval in United States v. Workman, 454 F.2d 1124, 1129 (9th Cir. 1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b841-22\">Hence, the effect of these admittedly improper remarks, when considered in cumulation with the other irregularities occurring throughout Cook\u2019s trial, cannot be so lightly dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-23\">VI. EMPLOYMENT OF GEBHARD RULE.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-24\">Assuming, <em>arguendo, </em>that it was proper to submit this case to the jury, then I accept the majority\u2019s determination that the trial court correctly instructed the jury, in accordance with Gebhard v. United States, 422 F.2d 281 (9th Cir. 1970), that the subjective falsity of Cook\u2019s testimony could be proved by circumstantial evidence. I deem it necessary, however, to correct a statement made by the majority as to the applicability of that rule. That incorrect statement is that the trial judge instructed the jury \u201cthat the <em>Gebhard </em>circumstantial evidence rule applied only to the charge in Item (a), in which the issue of knowledge was presented.\u201d My review of the instructions, however, reveals no such limitation on the rule\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"772\">*772</page-number>applicability.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The trial court did limit the circumstantial evidence rule to proof of the subjective falsity of Cook\u2019s allegedly perjured statements. It did not, and properly could not, limit the rule to item (a) because both item (a) and item (b) inquired as to Cook\u2019s \u201cknowledge.\u201d If <em>Gebhard </em>were not applicable to item (b), there would have been no evidence to support Cook\u2019s conviction on that question and answer, and we would be required to reverse under Yates v. United States, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b842-4\">VII. KNOWLEDGE INSTRUCTION.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-5\">Before delving into the myriad defects in that portion of the majority opinion pertaining to the \u201cknowledge\u201d instruction, I deem it necessary to set forth Cook\u2019s contentions concerning the instruction and the proper disposition of those claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-6\">Cook quarrels with the trial court\u2019s definition of the term \u201cknowledge.\u201d While I entertain grave doubts as to the propriety of basing a charge of perjury upon a word with so many varied meanings,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> I find no impropriety in the trial court\u2019s defining the term to encompass both belief and direct, or personal, knowledge since the word obviously is susceptible to either interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-11\">Cook also challenges the test of guilt included within the \u201cknowledge\u201d instruction:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b842-12\">\u201cIt is your role as jurors in this case to read the Grand Jury testimony of the defendant, determine from the context of the questions and answers given there <em>how the Government intended to use the term \u2018knowledge\u2019, </em>determine whether the defendant understood what the Government was asking, and then determine whether defendant willfully perjured himself.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b842-13\">I am deeply troubled by the trial court\u2019s framing the test of guilt with reference to the interrogator\u2019s intended use of the term \u201cknowledge\u201d in the queries forming the basis for the charge, especially when no evidence was presented as to \u201chow the Government intended to use the term. . . . \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b842-14\">The perjury statute itself, clearly formulates a \u201cdefendant\u2019s viewpoint\u201d test of guilt: \u201cWhoever, having taken an oath . . . that he will testify . truly, . . . willfully and contrary to such oath states any material matter <em>which he does not believe to be true, </em>is guilty of perjury. . . . \u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1621 (emphasis added). Furthermore, there is abundant judicial authority recognizing that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"773\">*773</page-number>crucial inquiry in a perjury case is whether the accused believed his testimony to be true in light of the meaning that <em>he, </em>not his interrogator, attributed to the questions and answers. <em>See, e. g., </em>United States v. Wall, 371 F.2d 398, 400 (6th Cir. 1967); United States v. Winter, 348 F.2d 204, 210 (2d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>382 U.S. 955, 86 S.Ct. 429, 15 L.Ed.2d 360 (1965); Seymour v. United States, 77 F.2d 577, 582 (8th Cir. 1935); United States v. Lattimore, 127 F.Supp. 405, 408 (D.D.C.), <em>aff'd, </em>98 U.S.App.D.C. 77, 232 F.2d 334 (1955); <em>cf. </em>United States v. Hagarty, 388 F.2d 713, 716 n. 2 (7th Cir. 1968); Van Liew v. United States, 321 F.2d 674, 679 (5th Cir. 1963); Fotie v. United States, 137 F.2d 831, 840, 842 (8th Cir. 1943).</p>\n<p id=\"b843-5\">This portion of the court\u2019s charge to the jury, therefore, is legally incorrect because it formulates a test of guilt inconsistent with the legal standard prescribed by the statute and the cases decided thereunder. Moreover, there can be no doubt as to the misleading nature of this instruction. The expression \u201cany knowledge\u201d might well have conveyed one meaning to Cook and another to the interrogator. Yet Cook would not be guilty of perjury under Section 1621, even assuming he knew how the interrogator intended to use the term, if he answered the question truthfully according to his own interpretation of the inquiry.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-9\">At the trial, in fact, Cook\u2019s principal ground of defense was that he construed the queries as eliciting his \u201cpersonal knowledge\u201d of the matters about which he was questioned, whereas the prosecution contended that the question could not be interpreted in that limited fashion. Under the instruction given by the trial court, however, the jury was not permitted to accept Cook\u2019s theory of the case.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> While I recognize that the jurors would be free to disbelieve Cook\u2019s assertions as to his interpretation of \u201cany knowledge,\u201d and thus find him guilty of perjury as charged in the indictment, I do not believe that it should be presumed that they would have taken that course of action had they been given a legally correct instruction as to the test of guilt under Section 1621.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-10\">Since this case turns wholly upon the subjective state of mind of Cook, and since we permit proof of this inherently vague and ambiguous charge by cireum<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"774\">*774</page-number>stantial evidence, I firmly believe that the instructions to the jury should have made it perfectly clear that Cook\u2019s guilt or innocence was to be determined with reference to <em>Ms </em>construction of the questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-4\">Prior to the trial court\u2019s submission of the case to the jury, Cook requested that the trial court give an instruction which was in substantial conformity to the legally accepted test of guilt.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> In addition, Cook specifically objected to the defective portion of the court\u2019s \u201cknowledge\u201d instruction, specifying the particular defect therein, in full compliance with Rule 30, Fed.R.Crim.Proc.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Hence, this issue is properly before us, and, as I understand the appellate function, we are bound to give it full consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-5\">As concisely stated by the Supreme Court, the guiding principle controlling the disposition of this contention is \u201cA conviction ought not to rest on an equivocal direction to the jury on a basic issue.\u201d Bollenbach v. United States, 326 U.S. 607, 613, 66 S.Ct. 402, 405, 90 L.Ed. 350 (1946).</p>\n<p id=\"b844-9\">Yet <em>Bollenbach </em>does not require the reversal of every conviction following a trial in which the jury has been given an incorrect or misleading instruction. Implicit within the above quotation are the two limitations attending application of the rule: (1) In determining whether a conviction could be said to \u201crest upon\u201d an improper instruction, the instructions must be read as a whole. <em>See, e. g., </em>Howard v. United States, 128 U.S.App.D.C. 336, 389 F.2d 287, 291 (1967); Cohen v. United States, 378 F.2d 751, 755 (9th Cir.), cert. denied, 389 U.S. 897, 88 S.Ct. 217, 19 L.Ed.2d 215 (1967). (2) The defective instruction must relate to \u201ca basic issue\u201d in the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-11\">I have thoroughly reviewed the trial court\u2019s entire charge to the jury and I can find no other instruction tending either to cure or to neutralize the highly prejudicial effect of the offending in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"775\">*775</page-number>struction. On the other hand, I reiterate that Cook did propose an instruction stating the correct rule of law and that he also drew the trial court\u2019s attention to the defective instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-5\">Furthermore, the record in this case reveals that Cook\u2019s interpretation of the term \u201cknowledge\u201d was not merely \u201ca basic issue,\u201d but the paramount issue in this case. Cook\u2019s defense rested almost entirely upon the ground that he interpreted the questions as inquiring into his \u201cpersonal knowledge.\u201d It is obvious, therefore, that the rule of <em>Bollenbach </em>applies with full force to the present action. Moreover, it should be noted that in the analogous situation presented in Weiler v. United States, 323 U.S. 606, 65 S.Ct. 548, 89 L.Ed. 495 (1945), the Supreme Court, even without the benefit of its subsequent decision in <em>Bollenbach, </em>did not hesitate to reverse a perjury conviction that <em>may have been </em>premised upon an incorrect instruction to the jury. In response to the Government\u2019s contention in <em>Weiler, </em>that the trial court\u2019s failure to instruct the jury in accordance with the \u201ctwo witness\u201d rule did not prejudice defendant because the record indicated that the rule had been satisfied, the Court stated,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b845-6\">\u201cThe jury convicted without being instructed that more than the testimony of a single witness was required to justify their verdict. This was no mere \u2018technical\u2019 error relating to the \u2018formalities and minutiae\u2019 of the trial. Bruno v. United States, <em>supra </em>[308 U.S. 287, 293, 294, 60 S.Ct. 198, 200, 84 L.Ed. 257]. We are not authorized to look at the printed record, resolve conflicting evidence, and reach the conclusion that the error was harmless because we think the defendant was guilty. That would be to substitute our judgment for that of the jury and, under our system of justice, juries alone have been entrusted with that responsibility.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b845-9\">323 U.S. at 611, 65 S.Ct. at 551.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-10\">Both the Supreme Court<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> and our own court<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> have staunchly adhered to the principles announced in <em>Weiler </em>and <em>Bollenbach. </em>I can perceive of no valid reason to cast them aside here. I would therefore hold that because of the erroneous standard of guilt included within the \u201cknowledge\u201d instruction, Cook is entitled to a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-11\">The defects in the majority's analysis of this issue should be patent. I cannot understand how the instruction given by the trial judge \u201cmeasures up to\u201d the defendant\u2019s viewpoint test of guilt followed in United States v. Lattimore, 127 F.Supp. 405, 408 (D.D.C.), aff\u2019d, 98 U.S.App.D.C. 77, 232 F.2d 334 (1955). Furthermore, the record conclusively demonstrates that Cook\u2019s requested instructions were, to use some of the majority\u2019s language, far \u201cmore enlightening than that given by the court\u201d because Cook\u2019s proffered charge correctly stated the applicable law. Finally, I pass the majority\u2019s suggestion that the length of an instruction may serve as a basis for ascertaining its validity. Surely, such a suggestion does not warrant an extended analytical reply.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-12\">VIII. CONCLUSION.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-13\">As the foregoing discussion indicates, many of the faults in the majority opinion are attributable to its analysis of each of Cook\u2019s separate contentions, isolated from the others. Perhaps the clearest example of the dangers inherent in this mode of analysis is seen from the majority\u2019s conflicting approaches in respect to the assumed operation of the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"776\">*776</page-number>In this case, the majority has elevated the jury t\u00f3.a.stature .unrivaled in my legal experience. In the eyes of my Brothers, the jury was able to adapt itself to a variety of positions with amazing ease,, and. an uncanny depth of legal perception. I fully agree with the majority that the law requires us to presume that the jurors followed the instructions given them by the trial court. I can therefore discern a tinge of reason in. my Brothers\u2019 disposition of Cook\u2019s contention concerning the hearsay evidence. Yet one must marvel at the jury\u2019s supposed ability at the same time, wholly to ignore the trial court\u2019s admittedly improper references concerning appellate review!</p>\n<p id=\"b846-4\">The jury\u2019s most remarkable feats, however, derived from its facility to divine the correct rule of law from nonexistent or incorrect instructions in the charge, while adhering to its presumed role of following the instructions that were given. The majority concedes that no instruction was given the jury that a verdict of guilty had to be supported by the unanimous agreement of the jurors as to Cook\u2019s guilt on at least one of the two allegedly perjurious statements. Nonetheless, my Brothers conclude that the jury was able to arrive at this conclusion on its own because of our court\u2019s prior holding in <em>Vitello, </em>a case involving distinct facts and stating a limitation upon the holding, which, \u2022 as I have shown, make that decision wholly inapplicable to Cook\u2019s situation. Also, while the majority apparently recognizes some defectiveness in the \u201cknowledge\u201d instruction, it implicitly assumes that the jury could not have been improperly influenced by the incorrect statement of law. I cannot believe that the jury was properly guided as to the applicable law when the instructions that the jury presumably followed foreclosed all consideration of the principal ground of Cook\u2019s asserted defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-5\">I would reverse.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b833-6\">. Two of these rules that are directly applicable to the present case are the rule prohibiting lifting an allegedly perjurious statement of the accused out of its immediate context, and the prohibition against an interrogator\u2019s \u201cbludgeoning\u201d a witness who is suspected of giving perjurious responses, both of which are discussed in Part II, <em>infra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b833-7\">. When Congress recently abolished the application of the \u201ctwo witness\u201d rule in certain situations (18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1623(e)), it provided another safeguard against unwarranted prosecutions for perjury, <em>i. e., </em>the privilege of recantation. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1623(d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b833-8\">. The trial judge's attempt to conduct the trial in a dignified manner was thwarted by the prosecution\u2019s utilization of Cook\u2019s case as the device for exposing the payoff system. The sensationalism thus injected into this trial by the Government created an unwholesome atmosphere wholly inconsistent with the exacting standards attendant to the trial of a charge of perjury in the federal courts. While the prosecution may have proceeded in the utmost good faith, it is clear, as the district judge ultimately recognized, that its bounds were overstepped. This presented problems which, despite the court\u2019s best efforts, were irremediable. Cook, like any other Accused, was entitled to the calm and dispassionate judgment of jurors uninfluenced by inadmissible testimony or other improper considerations, flee, <em>e. p., </em>Part VIII, <em>infra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b833-12\">The district judge, to some extent, at least, apparently shares some of my doubts about the validity of Cook\u2019s convic<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"764\">*764</page-number>tion. During the proceedings on Cook\u2019s motion for a new trial, he remarked:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b834-9\">\u201cNow these other alleged errors, and I think some of them may have been erroneous, some rulings of the Court, and there may have been some misconduct.

It includes information as to a fact, a clear perception of the truth, a firm belief, informing, an impression of the mind, the state of being aware.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b834-20\">\u201cSo, as you will note, it isn\u2019t a fixed term.

While the record in this case provides ample basis for a belief that Cook was somehow implicated in the payoff system, it is not our function as appellate judges to punish him for a crime with which he was not charged. Our consideration is to be confined to the crime charged to have been committed in the indictment. I do not believe the majority has properly exercised its function when it \u201cconvicts\u201d Cook for a mistake made by the interrogator. The disposition of Cook\u2019s appeal has led me to reflect upon the tenets so articulately expressed by Mr. Justice Frankfurter:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b838-13\">\u201c[I]t may not be amiss to remind that the question is not whether guilt may be spelt out of a record, but whether guilt has been found by a jury according to the procedure and standards appropriate for criminal trials in the federal courts.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b838-18\">Bollenbaeh v.

In view of the place of importance that trial by jury has in our Bill of Bights, it is not to be supposed that Congress intended to substitute the belief of appellate judges in the guilt of an accused, however justifiably engendered by the dead record, for ascertainment of guilt by a jury under appropriate judicial guidance, however cumbersome that process may be.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b838-20\">326 U.S. at 615, 66 S.Ct. at 406.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b841-8\">.

When the trial judge was addressing the panel of prospective jurors lie went to great lengths to explain to them the functions of the court and the jury. While explaining the court\u2019s duty to rule on objections to evidence, he stated, \u201cIt is always important, particularly to the Government, to protect the record from prejudicial error because if the defendant is found not guilty, there is no review; if the defendant is guilty, there can always be an appeal.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b841-25\">At the close of the trial, in his final instructions to the jury, the trial judge again referred to the availability of appellate review:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b841-26\">\u201cDuring the course of the trial it ultimately becomes the duty of counsel to make objections and for the Court to rule on them in accordance with the law, and the Court can make an error, those errors are usually corrected by an appellate Court if they have been damaging in any way.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b841-27\">\u201cThe jury should not be influenced in any way by the Court\u2019s ruling as to any evidence, and you shouldn\u2019t draw any inference from the fact that the question was put.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b842-7\">. The trial judge clearly explained to the jury the distinctions between, and the applicability of, the two rules applicable to the Government\u2019s burden of proof in this case:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b842-8\">\u201cNow, the objective falsity of the statements must, as I say, must be established in conformity with the \u2018two witnesses\u2019 rule, which is peculiar to perjury prosecutions, and bear in mind that perjury requires a higher measure of proof than the usual criminal offense.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b842-9\">* * * Hi *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b842-10\">\u201cTo continue with the evidence that pertains particularly to knowledge, the alleged falsity of this case is in the knowledge of the accused, and knowledge can rarely be established by any means other than through circumstantial evidence. While witnesses may see and hear and so be able to give direct evidence of what a defendant does or fails to do, of course, there can be no eye witness account of the state of mind of the defendant as to what knowledge he possessed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b842-20\">\u201cTherefore, you are instructed that in cases such as this when it is alleged that the falsity is in the knowledge of the accused, the law is that such alleged falsity in knowledge, that is, the subjective falsity of the statements, may be proved by circumstantial evidence alone, that is, the two witnesses or one witness and corroborative evidence rule does not apply to the state of the defendants mind, provided such evidence is sufficient to produce conviction in your minds of such falsity beyond a reasonable doubt upon all the evidence in the case and in accordance, of course, with the other instructions I have given you.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b842-21\">.

Under the instruction given, the jury was foreclosed from determining whether Cook\u2019s response was, in fact, premised upon his avowed interpretation of the term \u201cany knowledge.\u201d For example, the jury might have concluded that the interrogator intended to use the term \u201cknowledge\u201d to encompass \u201cbelief\u201d as well as direct knowledge. If the jury also concluded that Cook understood that the term could have been so used, then, as I read the instruction, the jury would have been required to find Cook guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-7\">It is not inconceivable that an individual possessing Cook\u2019s superior intellectual capacity would have recognized the ambiguity in the term \u201cany knowledge.\u201d Hence, while Cook might well have understood how the interrogator intended to use these words, he may still have answered the question truthfully according to the interpretation he ascribed as better fitting the phrase. Yet the jurors were not allowed to determine whether Cook did interpret the question in such a manner, and, hence, they could not accept his primary ground of defense, even if they fully believed his testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-12\">I do not mean, of course, to imply any belief that the jury accepted Cook\u2019s testimony. I only wish to point out that under the imperfect instruction, the jury could have believed Cook\u2019s version of the facts, and still would have been compelled to find him guilty.

An essential element is that the defendant must have acted with a criminal intent \u2014 he must have believed that what he swore to was false and he must have had the intent to deceive.
