After careful questioning pursuant to Rule 11, Fed.R.Crim.P., the district court found that appellant\u2019s plea was freely, intelligently, and voluntarily made. On April 6, 1973, when he was called forward to be sentenced, appellant, through his attorney Angus Harriett, moved to withdraw his guilty plea.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> After a full hearing on April 16, 1973, the court denied the motion. On January 3, 1974, the court sentenced appellant to four years imprisonment on each of the two counts to which he had pleaded guilty, the sentences to run concurrently. On this appeal we have been asked to reverse the order of the district court denying appellant\u2019s motion to withdraw his guilty plea. We decline.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-4\">Appellant bases his claim for relief on Rule 32(d), Fed.R.Crim.P., which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-5\">A motion to withdraw a plea of guilty or of <em>nolo contendere </em>may be made only before sentence is imposed or imposition of sentence is suspended; but to correct manifest injustice the court after sentence may set aside the judgment of conviction and permit the defendant to withdraw his plea.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b248-6\">It is the well-settled rule in this Circuit that, even prior to the imposition of sentence, an accused has no absolute right to withdraw a guilty plea, and that the grant or denial of such a motion is within the sound discretion of the trial court. United States v. Valdez, 5 Cir. 1971, 450 F.2d 1145; United States v. Arredondo, 5 Cir. 1971, 447 F.2d 976, cert. denied, 404 U.S. 1026, 92 S.Ct. 683, 30 L.Ed.2d 676; Kirshberger v. United States, 5 Cir. 1968, 392 F.2d 782.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-10\">Conceding that discretion rests with the trial judge, appellant urges that Rule 32(d) should, nevertheless, be liberally construed; and he has mustered formidable authority to support his contention. Almost fifty years ago the Supreme Court declared that \u201c[t]he court in exercise of its discretion will permit one accused to substitute a plea of not guilty and have a trial if for any reason the granting of the privilege seems fair and just.\u201d Kercheval v. United States, 1927, 274 U.S. 220, 224, 47 S.Ct. 582, 583, 71 L.Ed. 1009. The rationale for such a policy is that the public interest in protecting a defendant\u2019s right to trial by jury usually outweighs any inconvenience that the court or the prosecution is likely to suffer as a result of a withdrawn plea prior to sentencing. <em>See </em>Kadwell v. United States, 9 Cir. 1963, 315 F.2d 667.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Noting these considerations, Professor Wright has proposed that courts allow pre-sentencing withdrawals of guilty pleas virtually as a matter of course \u201cunless the prosecution has been substantially prejudiced by reliance upon the defendant\u2019s plea.\u201d 2 C. Wright, Federal Practice and Procedure, Criminal \u00a7 538, at 474-75 (1969). In United States v. Presley, 5 Cir. 1973, 478 F.2d 163, 167, we noted our adherence to \u201cthe general principle that Rule 32(d) should <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>be construed liberally in favor of the accused when a motion is made to withdraw before sentence is imposed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b249-5\">Appellant\u2019s statement of the law is very persuasive. Unfortunately for him, even under the most enlightened application of Rule 32(d), the facts of his ease do not justify the conclusion that the district court erred in refusing to permit the guilty plea to be withdrawn. First, in recommending a guilty plea appellant\u2019s counsel made no representation to him that any deal had been made, but merely expressed his opinion that appellant would receive only a probated sentence. Only after appellant\u2019s brother Willie Simmons \u2014 who had pleaded guilty to one count of a similar indictment and who appeared with appellant for sentencing \u2014 was sentenced to four years imprisonment, did appellant move to withdraw his guilty plea.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> To have granted the motion under these circumstances would have been to permit appellant to use the guilty plea as a means of testing the weight of the potential sentence \u2014 a primary policy ground for denying plea changes. <em>See </em>footnote 3, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b249-7\">Another important factor supporting the trial court\u2019s order in this case is the likelihood of substantial prejudice to the prosecution. In issuing its order, the district court made the finding that, as of the day the case was set for trial:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b249-8\">At great expense and with considerable difficulty the Government had secured the presence of sufficient witnesses to go to trial on seven of the fifteen counts charged in the indictment. Most of the witnesses were transients who had been difficult to locate. Subsequently, in reliance upon the guilty plea, the Government released and no longer maintained contact with these witnesses.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b249-12\">Locating those witnesses again would be extremely onerous and, in many cases, perhaps impossible.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-13\">Finally, appellant\u2019s argument that the court should have granted his motion because he is functionally illiterate, has had no formal education, and was in \u201can arena that instills fear,\u201d is amply refuted by the record concerning his apparent success as an \u201centrepreneur.\u201d Appellant operated a migrant farm labor camp for several years, never employing fewer than fifteen people and averaging gross revenues of $1200 to $1300 per week. In light of these facts, we are convinced that the court\u2019s finding that the guilty plea \u201cwas factually based and freely, intelligently, and voluntarily made\u201d is not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-14\">Recognizing the care with which the district court accepted appellant\u2019s guilty plea,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> the basis upon which its withdrawal was sought, and the likelihood of substantial prejudice to the government, we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying appellant\u2019s motion to withdraw his plea.</p>\n<p id=\"Ah9\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b247-19\">. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1584 and 1581(a).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b247-20\">\u00a7 1584. Sale into involuntary servitude Whoever knowingly and willfully holds to involuntary servitude or sells into any condition of involuntary servitude, any other person for any term, or brings within the United States any person so held, shall be fined not more than $5,000 or imprisoned not more than five years, or both.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b247-31\">\u00a7 1581. Peonage; obstructing enforcement (a) Whoever holds or returns any person to a condition of peonage, or arrests any person with the intent of placing him in or returning him to a condition of peonage, shall be fined not more than $5,000 or imprisoned not more than five years, or both.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b247-32\">The truncated record on appeal reveals little about the specific charges in the indictment. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>The transcript of the Rule 11 proceeding, however, indicates that the charges arose out of appellant\u2019s operation of a migrant farm labor camp at Pomona Park, Florida. There was testimony to the effect that workers recruited by appellant were forced at gunpoint to return to the camp and \u201cwork off\u201d money allegedly owed to appellant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b248-8\">. Rutledge Liles, an attorney who had been employed as trial counsel only, refused to join in the motion; Liles sought and was granted permission to withdraw as counsel in the case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b248-11\">. The Court in <em>Kadwell </em>contrasted the public interest in freely granting pre-sentencing motions to change pleas with the factors involved in considering post-sentencing motions :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-12\">But if a plea of guilty could be retracted with ease after sentence, the accused might be encouraged to plead guilty to test the weight of potential punishment, and withdraw the plea if the sentence were unexpectedly severe. The result would be to undermine respect for the courts and fritter away the time and painstaking effort devoted to the sentencing process.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b248-13\">315 F.2d at 670.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b249-9\">. Rising to object to continuing with the sentencing procedure and to move for permission to withdraw the guilty plea, Mr. Harriett stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b249-10\">I felt like in representing Jack Simmons, when we entered the plea of guilty to two counts of the involuntary servitude, that Jack\u2019s record would warrant probation. I still think his record would warrant probation, and we have a goodly number of witnesses here to testify as to his record, but obviously having been in Court when Willie was just sentenced, I think I probably gave Jack bad advice in entering his plea of guilty to two counts.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b249-16\">. Mr. Fine, who represented appellant at the hearing on the motion to withdraw the guilty plea, attested to the fairness and thoroughness of the Rule 11 proceeding:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b249-17\">I might state for the record, may it please the Court, so far as this Honorable Court is concerned in doing that, we do not feel, if Your Honor please, that the Court could have asked any other questions that would have materially helped the situation.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
