By this appeal, appellant Brady complains that the district court committed error in refusing to grant him a directed verdict on the grounds that the definition of the word \u201cinjury\u201d contained in the policy of insurance was ambiguous.</p>\n<p id=\"b1085-24\">Being a diversity case, this court must apply Florida substantive law. Erie Railroad Company v. Tompkins, 304 U.S. 64, 58 S.Ct. 817, 82 L.Ed. 1188 (1938). On the basis of the decisions of Florida courts in Berg v. New York Life Insurance Company, 88 So.2d 915 (Fla.1956), and Roberts v. Southern Farm Bureau Casualty Ins. Co., 215 So.2d 59 (Fla.App.1968), as well as other Florida decisions,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> it seems clear that an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1016\">*1016</page-number>insured seeking to recover permanent total disability benefits under an insurance policy which provides that the permanent total disability must result from bodily injury caused by an accident and resulting directly and independently of all other causes, has the burden of proving that the cause of his disability falls within these provisions. In the instant case, the evidence indicated that the insured\u2019s disability was caused by pre-existing conditions which was merely aggravated by the accident, and on the evidence submitted appellant was not entitled to recover under the terms of the contract of insurance.</p>\n<p id=\"b1086-4\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1085-15\">.
