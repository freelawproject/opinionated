Petitioners urge, particularly, that the Board\u2019s failure to act for 45 days entitled them to approval by default under Town Law \u00a7 276 (4). We conclude that the Appellate Division order should be affirmed because the petition was time barred in part and lacks merit as to the balance.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-6\">The significant events all transpired between September and December 1987. Petitioners, owners of a 6.62-acre parcel of land in the Town of Coeymans, on September 2, 1987, submitted an application to the Board to subdivide their parcel into four residential building plots. At a September 16 special meeting called to consider the application, several Board members and town residents expressed concern over purported restrictions in petitioners\u2019 deed, their proposed septic system and provisions for drainage, and the size of the lots. Petitioners were notified, at this meeting, that because the parcel abutted a county highway, the application had to be submitted to the County Planning Board <em>(see, </em>General Municipal Law \u00a7 239-n). The next day \u2014 September 17 \u2014 the Board sent on petitioners\u2019 application to the County Planning Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-7\">The Town Board on October 21, 1987 received the County Board\u2019s recommended objection to petitioners\u2019 application, and on November 4, 1987 voted to deny their application. Minutes of that meeting were delivered to the Board\u2019s office the next day, and by letter dated November 6, petitioners were notified of the decision. Meanwhile, on November 4, petitioners had applied to the Town Clerk for approval of their application by default, due to the Board\u2019s failure to act within 45 days of the September 16 hearing (Town Law \u00a7 276 [4]), and the Town Clerk denied that request.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-8\">Petitioners on December 16, 1987 commenced the present article 78 proceeding to annul the Board\u2019s determination, or compel the Town Clerk to issue a certificate of approval by default, or declare that the town\u2019s subdivision regulations were invalid. Supreme Court dismissed the entire petition as untimely and the Appellate Division affirmed. The Appellate Division agreed that the proceeding against the Board, having <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>been commenced more than 30 days after delivery of the minutes to the Board\u2019s office, was time barred, but it held that the 30-day limitation was inapplicable to the Town Clerk\u2019s denial of petitioners\u2019 request for approval by default. As to that portion of the petition, the Appellate Division held that the Town Clerk was not required to issue a default certification because the 45-day period set forth in Town Law \u00a7 276 (4) had been tolled.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-5\">Timeliness of Proceedings Against The Board</p>\n<p id=\"b270-6\">As against the Board, the petition was correctly dismissed as untimely under Town Law \u00a7 282.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-7\">A party aggrieved by a decision of a planning board \"concerning such plat or the changing of the zoning regulations of such land, or any officer, department, board or bureau of the town, may have the decision reviewed by a special term of the supreme court in the manner provided by article seventy-eight of the civil practice law and rules <em>provided the proceeding is commenced within thirty days after the filing of the decision in the office of the hoard. \u201d </em>(Town Law \u00a7 282 [emphasis added].) As the statute plainly specifies, the event that triggers the 30-day limitations period is the filing of a planning board\u2019s decision in its office and not \u2014 as petitioners urge \u2014 notice sent to the affected party <em>(see, Pagliaroli v Zoning Bd. of Appeals, </em>66 AD2d 997, 998; 2 Anderson, New York Zoning Law and Practice \u00a7 26.14, at 384 [3d ed]). The statute places on the petitioners \u2014 and not the planning boards \u2014 responsibility for following up on their application by determining when a board\u2019s decision has been filed in its office.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-8\">Here, the record reveals that on November 5, 1987 the relevant minutes reflecting the decision denying petitioners\u2019 application were filed in the Board\u2019s office, which triggered the 30-day limitations period. In that petitioners commenced this proceeding against the Board on December 16, 1987 \u2014 beyond the 30-day period \u2014 that portion of the petition was properly dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-9\">Timeliness of Proceedings Against The Town Clerk</p>\n<p id=\"b270-10\">Town Law \u00a7 282 does not, however, affect the petition against the Town Clerk. While respondents urge that the 30-day period should apply also to a Town Clerk\u2019s decision, relying on the statute\u2019s reference to \"any officer, department, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>board or bureau of the town,\u201d that reference \u2014 as the Appellate Division correctly observed \u2014 \"merely confers standing on the enumerated persons or entities to challenge a Town Planning Board decision. * * * Notably, Town Boards may authorize, by ordinance, the 'proper local authorities\u2019 (Town Law \u00a7268 [2]) to pursue judicial enforcement of the local zoning provisions, where necessary. Accordingly, petitioners\u2019 challenge to the Town Clerk\u2019s refusal to issue a default certificate is not governed by the time constraints delineated in Town Law \u00a7 282, but by CPLR 217, which imposes a four-month limitation period. By this standard, the proceeding against the Town Clerk was timely commenced.\u201d (146 AD2d, at 105.)</p>\n<p id=\"b271-4\">Petitioners\u2019 claim on its merits is grounded on Town Law \u00a7 276 (4). That section in substance requires a Town Planning Board to rule on an application for final subdivision approval within 45 days after a public hearing, which itself must be held within 45 days of submission of a plat in final form. If a Town Planning Board fails to act within the specified time, the plat is deemed approved and a certificate to that effect must be issued by the Town Clerk on demand (Town Law \u00a7 276 [4]). Here, the Board held its hearing on September 16, 1987 and, by petitioners\u2019 count, the 45-day statutory period expired no later than November 2, 1987, entitling them to approval by default.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-5\">We reject petitioner\u2019s argument, as did the Appellate Division, but on somewhat different grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-6\">The Appellate Division reasoned that the 45-day period was \"tolled\u201d pending County Planning Board review because section 276 (4) \"speaks to a plat submitted in <em>final form,\u201d </em>and petitioners\u2019 \"application was not finalized until the Town Planning Board actually received the written recommendation of the County Planning Board on October 21, 1987.\u201d (146 AD2d, at 106.) As a rule, however, time limitations created by statute are not tolled in the absence of statutory authority. Courts may only \"construe provisions made by the Legislature creating exceptions or interruptions to the running of the time limited by statute. * * * They may not themselves create such exceptions.\u201d <em>(Mack v Mendels, </em>249 NY 356, 359.) Here, except where the parties agree, there is no statutory authority for tolling, or suspending, the 45-day period; to the contrary, there is a legislative mandate for speedy administrative action. A board\u2019s failure to act within the tightly prescribed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>time limits itself results in approval by operation of law <em>(see, Matter of Sun Beach Real Estate Dev. Corp. v Anderson, </em>98 AD2d 367, 369, <em>affd on opn below </em>62 NY2d 965). Thus, we cannot agree that the statutory period was \"tolled\u201d during the County Planning Board review.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-5\">Nor is the issue resolved by the statutory requirement of \"submission of a plat in final form.\u201d (Town Law \u00a7 276 [4].) That reference distinguishes situations where an applicant seeks final approval of the proposed subdivision by submitting a \"final plat\u201d or a \"plat in final form\u201d <em>(see, </em>Town Law \u00a7 276 [2] [b], [c]; [4]) from those where an applicant submits a \"preliminary plat\u201d for tentative approval (Town Law \u00a7 276 [2] [a], [c]; [3]). In cases that fall into the former category \u2014 as here \u2014 the application for final approval must be acted upon by the Town Board within the prescribed time limits whether or not the plat is actually in final form <em>(Matter of Castle Estates v Hubbard, </em>52 Misc 2d 774, 777-778 [Simons, J.]). While the failure to satisfy the statutory definition of \"final plat\u201d might, in an appropriate case, warrant a denial of the application, it does not justify a failure to act <em>(see, Matter of Wallkill Manor v Coulter, </em>33 NY2d 783; <em>Wallberg v Planning Bd., </em>115 AD2d 539).</p>\n<p id=\"b272-6\">Nevertheless, we agree with the Appellate Division\u2019s conclusion that there was no approval by default. We reach that conclusion because, here, the statutory period did not start with the submission of petitioners\u2019 application to the Board. General Municipal Law \u00a7 239-n explicitly required the Board to refer the application to the County Planning Board for its review, and the Board was powerless to act on the application until it received the County Board\u2019s recommendation or until 30 days had expired with no response <em>(see, </em>2 Anderson, <em>op. cit., </em>\u00a7 19.09, at 32-34). Where the Legislature specifically, and strictly, allotted 45 days for Town Planning Board action, it would be inconsistent with the legislative design to start that time running when the Board was without authority to proceed on the application for as much as 30 days <em>(see generally, Matter of Sun Beach Real Estate Dev. Corp. v Anderson, </em>62 NY2d 965, <em>supra).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b272-7\">Thus, the 45-day period did not commence to run until October 21, 1987, when the Board received the County Planning Board\u2019s recommendation. Measured from that date, the November 4 denial was well within the statutory period, and petitioners\u2019 demand for a default certification was therefore properly rejected.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>Petitioners\u2019 remaining claims are without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-4\">Accordingly, the order of the Appellate Division should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-5\">Chief Judge Wachtler and Judges Simons, Alexander, Titone, Hancock, Jr., and Bellacosa concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-6\">Order affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
