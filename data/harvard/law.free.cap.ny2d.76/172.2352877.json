The subcontractor had agreed to indemnify the contractor for such liability and the issue submitted is whether General Obligations Law \u00a7 5-322.1 bars enforcement of that provision in their contract. We hold that the indemnification agreement is enforceable under these circumstances, in which there has been no finding of negligence on the part of the general contractor, and therefore affirm the order of the Appellate Division.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-9\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b259-10\">Plaintiff Paul Brown was an employee of Central Furring &amp; Dry Wall Company, a subcontractor working on the lobby/ atrium of an office building under construction in Manhattan. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>He was injured when the scaffold on which he was standing collapsed. The building was owned by defendant Two Exchange Plaza Partners who hired defendant George A. Fuller Company as general contractor. Fuller in turn subcontracted with Heydt Contracting Corporation for erection of the scaffold, to be used by all of the subcontractors in the lobby/ atrium, and with A &amp; M Wallboard Company to erect the walls and ceilings of the building. A &amp; M hired plaintiff\u2019s employer to install the suspension system for the ceiling. The present dispute concerns the indemnity clause in the contract between Fuller and A &amp; M.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-5\">Plaintiffs commenced this action against Fuller and Two Exchange Plaza Partners seeking to recover for Brown\u2019s injuries and his wife\u2019s derivative damages. Fuller impleaded Heydt, A &amp; M and Central Furring and those third-party defendants asserted cross claims against each other and counterclaims against Fuller and Two Exchange Plaza.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The evidence at trial failed to establish why the scaffold collapsed. Nonetheless, at the close of the evidence, the court directed a verdict against Fuller based on Labor Law \u00a7 240 (1) and submitted the question of damages to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-6\">Fuller then moved for a directed verdict on its third-party claims against Heydt, A &amp; M and Central Furring contending that each was liable to it as a statutory agent under Labor Law \u00a7 240 (1), that each was negligent and thus liable to it for contribution, and that Heydt and A &amp; M were liable to it under indemnification clauses in their subcontracts. The trial court ruled that none of the third-party defendants were Fuller\u2019s statutory agents and dismissed those claims. It dismissed Fuller\u2019s claims for contribution against A &amp; M and Central Furring, holding that there was no evidence of negligence on their part to submit to the jury. It submitted the question of Heydt\u2019s negligence for the jury and reserved decision on Fuller\u2019s claim for indemnification from A &amp; M and Heydt.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-7\">In submitting the question of Heydt\u2019s negligence to the jury, the court denied Heydt\u2019s request to charge the jury that fault could be apportioned between Fuller and Heydt and instructed it to render an \"all or nothing\u201d verdict. The jury returned a verdict against Fuller in the amount of $2,350,000 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>for plaintiff and $500,000 for his wife.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> It found that Heydt was not negligent and, therefore, not liable to Fuller. The court then took under advisement the question previously reserved, Fuller\u2019s right to judgment against A &amp; M and Heydt based on the contractual indemnity provisions in their respective contracts, and directed the parties to prepare written submissions.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> It subsequently denied the motion, holding Fuller\u2019s application untimely, but stated its belief that indemnity was not available unless the subcontractor was \"in some way negligent\u201d and that in any event the clause was unenforceable under General Obligations Law \u00a7 5-322.1 because Fuller was liable under Labor Law \u00a7 240 (1).</p>\n<p id=\"b261-4\">Only Fuller appealed. The Appellate Division found the motion for indemnification timely and modified Supreme Court by awarding Fuller judgment over against A &amp; M. The court reasoned that A &amp; M\u2019s contractual indemnification liability encompassed the situation here, where Fuller was sued by an employee of A &amp; M\u2019s subcontractor for injuries suffered while performing A &amp; M\u2019s work. It held further that General Obligations Law \u00a7 5-322.1 did not preclude enforcement of the indemnification clause even though A &amp; M was not negligent and Fuller was liable under Labor Law \u00a7 240 (1). The court affirmed the remainder of Supreme Court\u2019s judgment, rejecting Fuller\u2019s claim for indemnification from Heydt and A &amp; M\u2019s claims that it was entitled to indemnification from Central Furring and that there should be a new trial on damages. We now affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b262-5\">The indemnification clause in the contract between Fuller and A &amp; M is written in broad terms. In it, A &amp; M agreed to assume liability incurred by Fuller for personal injuries \"or any other claim arising out of, in connection with or as a consequence of the performance of the Work <em>and/or </em>any acts or omission of the Subcontractor or any of its * * * subcontractors\u201d (emphasis added). Thus, A &amp; M was to indemnify Fuller in either of two situations: (1) where a claim arose out of, in connection with or as a consequence of the performance of A &amp; M\u2019s work <em>(see, O\u2019Connor v Serge Elevator Co., </em>58 NY2d 655, 657) or (2) where a claim arose out of the \"acts or omission[s]\u201d of A &amp; M. Manifestly, the purpose of the clause was to broaden A &amp; M\u2019s liability under common-law rules of implied indemnity <em>(cf., Mas v Two Bridges Assocs., </em>75 NY2d 680; <em>Guzman v Haven Plaza Hous. Dev. Fund Co., </em>69 NY2d 559, 567-568). It provides for indemnification when the claim arises out of the subcontractor\u2019s work even though the subcontractor has not been negligent. By its terms the clause applies in this case in which plaintiff, an employee of the subcontractor hired by A &amp; M, was injured while performing work called for in A &amp; M\u2019s contract with Fuller. Therefore, although there is no evidence of negligence on A &amp; M\u2019s part, the indemnification agreement requires A &amp; M to indemnify Fuller <em>(see, Walsh v Morse Diesel, </em>143 AD2d 653, 654-655).</p>\n<p id=\"b262-6\">m</p>\n<p id=\"b262-7\">A &amp; M contends, nonetheless, that the indemnification clause is unenforceable because of the provisions of General Obligations Law \u00a7 5-322.1. That section declares void agreements purporting to indemnify contractors against liability for injuries \"contributed to, caused by or resulting from the negligence of the promisee, his agents or employees, or indemnitee, whether such negligence be in whole or in part\u201d.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>A &amp; M argues that Fuller\u2019s liability under Labor Law \u00a7 240 (1) is, for purposes of General Obligations Law \u00a7 5-322.1, the legal equivalent of a finding of negligence and bars indemnification here. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-5\">The legislative purpose underlying Labor Law \u00a7 240 (1) was to place \" ' \"ultimate responsibility for safety practices at building construction jobs where such responsibility actually belongs, on the owner and general contractor\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>(Bland v Manocherian, </em>66 NY2d 452, 459, quoting 1969 NY Legis Ann, at 407) instead of on workers, who \"are scarcely in a position to protect themselves from accident.\u201d <em>(Koenig v Patrick Constr. Corp., </em>298 NY 313, 318.) To that end, the Legislature determined that owners or contractors shall be liable for failing to provide or erect safety devices necessary to give proper protection to a worker who sustains injuries proximately caused by that failure. Liability is not predicated on fault: it is imputed to the owner or contractor by statute and attaches irrespective of whether due care was exercised and without reference to principles of negligence <em>(Zimmer v Che-mung County Performing Arts, </em>65 NY2d 513, 521-522; <em>Crawford v Leimzider, </em>100 AD2d 568, 569). A violation of the statute is not the equivalent of negligence and does not give rise to an inference of negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-6\">During trial Heydt, A &amp; M and Central Furring had the opportunity, and every incentive, to defend themselves against Fuller\u2019s claims by presenting evidence of Fuller\u2019s negligence. They failed to establish a jury question on that issue, however, and the cause of the accident was not resolved. Liability was imposed on Fuller only because of the absolute liability provisions of Labor Law \u00a7 240 (1). Without a finding of negligence on the part of Fuller, General Obligations Law \u00a7 5-322.1\u2019s prohibition against indemnifying a contractor for its own negligence is inapplicable <em>(see, Walsh v Morse Diesel, </em>143 AD2d 653, 655, <em>supra) </em>and Fuller is entitled to judgment over against A &amp; M under the terms of their agreement.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b263-7\">The result is consistent with the purpose and history of General Obligations Law \u00a7 5-322.1 and our prior holdings. The section was enacted in 1975 to prevent a practice prevalent in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>the construction industry of requiring contractors and subcontractors to assume liability by contract for the negligence of others. The Legislature believed that such \"coercive\u201d bidding requirements restricted the number of contractors able to obtain or afford the necessary hold harmless insurance and that it unfairly imposed liability on a contractor or subcontractor for the fault of others over whom it had no control. Moreover, such insurance raised the costs of construction unnecessarily, since the cost of the insurance was added to the bid price, and it also resulted in double coverage in many cases by requiring both hold harmless insurance and protective liability insurance <em>(see, </em>Mem of Assemblyman Brown, 1975 NY Legis Ann, at 311; <em>and cf., Kinney v Lisk Co., </em>76 NY2d 215 [decided herewith]).</p>\n<p id=\"b264-5\">As originally enacted, the statute provided that any agreement in a construction contract \"purporting to indemnify or hold harmless the promisee against liability for damage arising out of bodily injury to persons or damage to property <em>caused by or resulting from the sole negligence </em>of the promisee * * * is against public policy and is void and unenforceable\u201d (emphasis added). In <em>Quevedo v City of New York </em>(56 NY2d 150, 153), we held that since the statute spoke in terms of \"sole negligence\u201d, indemnification clauses in construction contracts were invalid only to the extent they purported to indemnify a party for damages it alone had caused. Nothing prevented indemnification in cases of joint fault (56 NY2d, at 156; <em>see also, County of Onondaga v Penetryn Sys., </em>84 AD2d 934, 935, <em>affd </em>56 NY2d 726).</p>\n<p id=\"b264-6\">In 1981 the Legislature amended section 5-322.1 to prohibit indemnity agreements in which owners or contractors sought to pass along the risks for their <em>own negligent actions </em>to other contractors or subcontractors, even if the accident was caused only in part by the owner\u2019s or contractor\u2019s negligence <em>(see, </em>Mem of Assemblyman Goldstein in support of proposed amendment, 1981 NY Legis Ann, at 502). Thus, the 1981 amendment eliminated the \"sole negligence\u201d language and substituted a prohibition on agreements to indemnify for injuries \"caused by * * * negligence of the promisee * * * whether such negligence be in whole or in part\u201d (General Obligations Law \u00a7 5-322.1).</p>\n<p id=\"b264-7\">Because there was no evidence of any fault on the part of Fuller in this case, neither the wording nor intent of the statute is violated by allowing it to allocate responsibility for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>this unexplained accident through an indemnification provision. Nor will the decision here encourage carelessness by contractors, as A &amp; M implies, because a contractor who is guilty of negligence will be barred from recovering contractual indemnity by virtue of the General Obligations Law provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-5\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b265-6\">A &amp; M argues further that if it is held liable to Fuller for indemnification, Central Furring should be held answerable to it under the indemnification clause in their subcontract. We agree with the Appellate Division\u2019s determination that the clause does not apply under these facts. Since there is no evidence of actual negligence on the part of Central Furring, as required under the indemnification agreement between the parties, the clause does not apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-7\">We have considered A &amp; M\u2019s remaining arguments and conclude they are without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-8\">Accordingly, the order of the Appellate Division should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-9\">Chief Judge Wachtler and Judges Kaye, Alexander, Ti-tone, Hancock, Jr., and Bellacosa concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-10\">Order affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b260-8\">. The action against Two Exchange Plaza Partners was discontinued prior to trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b261-5\">. Fuller eventually settled the plaintiffs\u2019 claims for $1,243,855.66 without the concurrence of the third-party defendants.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b261-6\">. The clause in its entirety provides: <em>\"Subcontractor hereby agrees, to the extent permitted by law, to assume the entire responsibility and liability for and defense of and to pay and indemnify the Owner and Contractor against any loss, cost, expense, liability or damage </em>and will hold each of them harmless from and pay any loss, cost, expense, liability or damage (including, without limitation, judgments, attorney\u2019s fees, court costs and the cost of appellate proceedings), <em>which the Owner or Contractor incurs because of injury to or death of any person </em>or on account of damage to property, including loss of use thereof, <em>or any other claim arising out of, in connection with, or as a consequence of the performance of the Work and/or any acts or omission of the Subcontractor </em>or any of its officers, directors, employees, agents, subcontractors or anyone directly or indirectly employed by Subcontractor for whom it may be liable as it relates to the scope of this Contract, whether such injuries to person or damage to property are due to any negligence of the Owner, the Contractor, its or their employees or agents or any other person. <em>Subcontractor will purchase and maintain such insurance as will protect it including contractual coverage\u201d </em>(emphasis added).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b262-8\">. General Obligations Law \u00a7 5-322.1 provides in relevant part: \"A covenant, promise, agreement or understanding in, or in connection with or collateral to a contract or agreement relative to the construction, alteration, repair or maintenance of a building * * * purporting to indemnify or hold harmless the promisee against liability for damage arising out of bodily injury to persons or damage to property contributed to, caused by or resulting from the negligence of the promisee, his agents or employees, or indemnitee, whether such negligence be in whole or in part, is against public policy and is void and unenforceable\u201d.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b263-8\">. A &amp; M claims a new trial is required to decide Fuller\u2019s negligence but we agree with the Appellate Division that to the extent General Obligations Law \u00a7 5-322.1 calls Fuller\u2019s negligence into issue, a new trial is not needed to resolve it because Fuller\u2019s negligence was litigated fully and the accident remains unexplained.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
