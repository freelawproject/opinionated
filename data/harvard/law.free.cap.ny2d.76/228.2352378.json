A fire broke out causing extensive damage not only to portions of the building covered by the contract but to other areas as well. Plaintiffs insurer paid plaintiff for the full extent of the damage, and in this negligence action, suing in the name of plaintiff as its subrogee, seeks reimbursement for its loss. The narrow issue in this appeal, requiring an interpretation of the subrogation waiver clause in the agreement between plaintiff owner and defendant contractor, is whether that clause bars the subrogation claim for damage to those portions of the building not included in the Work under the contract. For reasons stated hereafter, we agree with the Appellate Division that the waiver clause applies only to damage to the areas within the limits of \"the Work\u201d and that, therefore, the subrogation claim is, except for such damages, not barred. Accordingly, there should be an affirmance.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-8\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b314-9\">Plaintiff, the owner of Carnegie Towers in Manhattan, contracted with defendant, a waterproofing contractor, to do certain corrective work on the exterior of the building and the parking garage floor. The relevant provisions of the contract, a standard American Institute of Architects (AIA) form contract for \"construction projects of limited scope\u201d, are these.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-10\">Under article 1 (the Work), the specific work required to be performed is described as follows: \"Corrective Work to the Masonry and Concrete Portions of Exterior Walls and the Parking Garage Floor Slab for Carnegie Towers 115 East 87th Street New York, New York\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-11\">The general provision describing the Work, set forth in article 7.4, is as follows: \"The Work comprises the completed construction required by the Contract Documents and includes all labor necessary to produce such construction, and all materials and equipment incorporated or to be incorporated in such construction.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b315-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>Under article 17 (Insurance) the following provisions are pertinent:</p>\n<p id=\"b315-4\">Article 17.1 requires that the contractor purchase and maintain: \"liability insurance <em>* * * to protect [it] </em>* * * from claims for damages, <em>other than to the Work itself, </em>to property which may arise out of or result from the Contractor\u2019s operations under this Contract\u201d (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b315-5\">Article 17.3 requires that the owner: \"purchase and maintain property insurance <em>upon the entire Work at the site </em>to the full insurable value thereof. This insurance shall include the interests of the Owner, the Contractor, Subcontractors and Sub-subcontractors <em>in the Work </em>and shall insure against the perils of fire\u201d (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b315-6\">Article 17.6 provides: \"[t]he Owner and Contractor waive all rights against each other for damages caused by fire or other perils <em>to the extent covered by insurance obtained pursuant to this Article or any other property insurance applicable to the Work\u201d </em>(emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b315-7\">On May 24, 1984, a fire started in a shed constructed by defendant on a fifth-floor terrace, causing approximately $140,000 in damages to the interior hallways, apartments and to the exterior of the building. Seven months after the fire, plaintiff was paid $139,351.74 for the loss by its property insurer which has brought this action as subrogee to recover its loss from defendant. Defendant, in turn, has commenced a third-party action against its subcontractor, Coyne Electrical Contractors.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-8\">Relying on the waiver provision contained in article 17.6, defendant moved to dismiss the complaint. Supreme Court granted defendant\u2019s motion and, <em>sua sponte, </em>dismissed the third-party action, citing <em>Trump-Equitable Fifth Ave. Co. v H.R.H. Constr. Corp. </em>(106 AD2d 242, <em>affd for reasons stated below </em>66 NY2d 779). The Appellate Division, with one Justice dissenting, modified on the law by reinstating the complaint to the extent that it seeks damages for losses to portions of the building not included in the contractual work and reinstated the third-party complaint. The Appellate Division distinguished <em>Trump-Equitable </em>and held that, under the contract here, plaintiff was required to obtain coverage only for \"the Work\u201d and that \"[a]ny other coverage the owner may have had for the property was not, by the terms of [article] 17.6, subject to the waiver of subrogation therein\u201d (153 AD2d, at 478). The Appellate Division certified to this court the ques<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>tion: \"Was the order of the Supreme Court, as modified by this Court, properly made?\u201d We answer the question in the affirmative.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b316-6\">Our decision turns on a construction of article 17.6 in the contract in which the owner agreed to waive all rights against the contractor for damages caused by fire \"to the extent covered by insurance obtained pursuant to this Article or any other property insurance applicable to the Work\u201d. The question is: Does the owner\u2019s waiver under article 17.6 bar the subrogation claim of its insurer for damages caused by the contractor in areas of the building outside the limits of the Work?</p>\n<p id=\"b316-7\">In addressing the legal issue of what the parties intended, we note that we are dealing with a commercial construction contract between business entities. The owner and contractor in article 17.6 (the waiver clause), article 17.1 (requiring the contractor to insure its potential liability for non-Work property damage) and article 17.3 (requiring the owner to provide property insurance for the contractor\u2019s Work) have agreed upon an allocation of their respective responsibilities, risks and insurance obligations pertaining to the possibility of property damage occurring during the contract and to the contractor\u2019s potential liability stemming from its operations. Neither party claims that the contract is ambiguous nor raises any claim of misunderstanding, overreaching or unconscionability. No policy consideration or other reason has been suggested why the parties should not abide by their agreed-upon allocation of the risks and responsibilities, once the meaning of their agreement has been determined <em>(see, Gillman v Chase Manhattan Bank, </em>73 NY2d 1, 14; <em>Kalisch-Jarcho, Inc. v City of New York, </em>72 NY2d 727, 732; <em>Simons v Fried, </em>302 NY 323, 324).</p>\n<p id=\"b316-8\">The allocation of the risks and responsibilities, according to plaintiff, is that the owner must provide property insurance protection covering <em>the contractor\u2019s Work </em>(art 17.3) and the contractor, in turn, must provide liability insurance covering whatever property damage it may cause <em>other than to the Work itself </em>(art 17.1). The waiver clause (art 17.6), plaintiff says, permits the owner\u2019s insurer to proceed against the contractor for property damage caused by its negligence but <em>not </em>for damage covered by insurance which the owner has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>provided to protect the contractor\u2019s interest \u2014 i.e., damage resulting to the contractor\u2019s Work. As to such damage, there can be no subrogation. In the event of a loss, such as the one here, involving fire damage to the Work and areas beyond the Work, the damages may be shared between the owner\u2019s insurer (which is responsible for so much of the damage as occurs to the Work) and the contractor\u2019s liability insurer (which, assuming there is liability, must bear ultimate responsibility for damages outside the Work).</p>\n<p id=\"b317-5\">The agreement, as the defendant and third-party defendant view it, allocates a greater share of the risk and responsibilities to the owner and ultimately to the owner\u2019s insurer. Under their construction, the waiver clause (art 17.6) prevents the owner\u2019s insurer from proceeding against the contractor for its negligence not only for damage occurring to the Work but to other areas of the building, provided that the damage \"arose out of, or was related to, the Work itself.\u201d (Brief of third-party defendant, at 13.) Thus, in the event of a fire arising out of the contractor\u2019s operations which results in damage both to the Work and areas outside the Work, the owner\u2019s insurance carrier\u2019s right to subrogate is totally barred. In addition to the loss for damage to the Work, the owner\u2019s carrier must also bear the loss for damage to other areas which, under the contrary construction urged by plaintiff, would ultimately have been borne by the liability insurer of the contractor.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-6\">Our analysis of the contract supports plaintiff\u2019s construction. The waiver clause (art 17.6) bars the claim of the owner\u2019s subrogee to the extent that the damages sought are covered either by: (1) \"insurance obtained pursuant to [art 17]\u201d or (2) \"any other property insurance applicable to the <em>Work\u201d </em>(emphasis added). The first alternative (insurance obtained pursuant to art 17) refers to insurance which the owner has procured under article 17.3 in which it is obligated to provide insurance \"upon the entire <em>Work at the site\u201d </em>(emphasis added) and to include therein the interests of the contractor and subcontractors \"in the <em>Work\u201d </em>(emphasis added). The second speaks for itself. It refers only to other insurance \"applicable to the <em>Work\u201d </em>(emphasis added). It makes no difference whether the policy under which subrogation is sought is one which the owner purchased specifically to insure the Work pursuant to article 17.3 or some other policy covering the owner\u2019s property in which the owner has also provided coverage for the Work. In either event, the waiver clause, if given its plain meaning, bars subrogation only for those damages <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>covered by insurance which the owner has provided to meet the requirement of protecting the contractor\u2019s limited interest in the building \u2014 i.e., damages to the Work itself. On the other hand, no wording in article 17 supports the view urged by defendants,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> that the waiver in article 17.6 includes not only damage to the Work itself but encompasses all damages flowing from the Work.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-5\">Plaintiff owner\u2019s construction of article 17.6, unlike that of defendants, gives full effect to the bargain concerning the parties\u2019 respective insurance responsibilities set forth in article 17. Under article 17.1, the contractor is required to obtain liability insurance protecting it from \"claims for damages * * * to property * * * other than to the Work itself\u2019. Under plaintiff\u2019s construction, in the event of a claim for non-Work property damage, the insurer under the contractor\u2019s liability policy would be responsible. Under the construction of article 17.6 urged by defendants, however, this would not be so. The contractor\u2019s liability insurer is relieved of responsibility for any damage caused by the contractor to parts of the building outside the Work. Any responsibility for such a loss which the contractor\u2019s insurer might otherwise bear is transferred to the owner\u2019s insurer which in effect, is transformed into the liability carrier for the contractor. This result is not consistent with either the natural and obvious meaning of article 17.6 or with what seems to be the over-all sense of the arrangement in article 17 \u2014 that the contractor is to be responsible for negligently caused damage outside the Work and must carry a policy insuring its liability therefor <em>(see, </em>art 10.7 in which the contractor assumes responsibility to the owner for acts and omissions of its employees and its subcontractors).</p>\n<p id=\"b318-6\">Moreover, plaintiff\u2019s interpretation of the subrogation waiver clause as being limited in scope to damage to the Work is consistent with the difference which our case law recognizes in the respective interests of the owner and contractor under an owner\u2019s property insurance policy during the course of construction. Under <em>Tishman Co. v Carney &amp; Del Guidice </em>(34 NY2d 941, 942-943, <em>affg </em>36 AD2d 273), the contractor\u2019s insurable interest in the irlsured building extends only to the tools, labor and materials which it has furnished and the owner\u2019s insured\u2019s right of subrogation is barred only to the extent of that insurable interest. The rationale of <em>Tishman </em>is simply <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>that the contractor is a constructive insured under the owner\u2019s property insurance policy <em>only to the extent </em>of its insurable interest in the building; it follows, therefore \u2014 under the settled rule that the insurer has no right of subrogation against its own insured <em>(see, Pennsylvania Gen. Ins. Co. v Austin Powder Co., </em>68 NY2d 465, 471; <em>cf., New York Bd. of Fire Underwriters v Trans Urban Constr. Co., </em>60 NY2d 912)\u2014 that the owner\u2019s insurer is barred from subrogation only to the extent of property in which the contractor has an insurable interest: i.e., its tools and the labor and materials which it has furnished <em>(see, </em>arts 1, 17.4).</p>\n<p id=\"b319-5\">Defendant\u2019s broad construction of article 17.6 \u2014 embracing all claims for damages to the building covered by the owner\u2019s property insurance, not only property in which the contractor has an insurable interest \u2014 is patently inconsistent with <em>Tishman </em>and imposes a restriction on the carrier\u2019s subrogation rights beyond that imposed by the law or by what seems to be the commonsense reading of article 17. We are, thus, not persuaded by the reasoning in <em>Haemonetic Corp. v Brophy &amp; Phillips Co. </em>(23 Mass App 254, 501 NE2d 524 [1986]), relied on by defendants, that merely because \"the owner chose to provide [broader insurance than necessary] to comply\u201d with the requirement in the insurance clause, the owner\u2019s insurer\u2019s subrogation rights should be barred for all damage to the building irrespective of the contractor\u2019s insurable interest <em>(id., </em>at 526).</p>\n<p id=\"b319-6\">We agree with the analysis of the court in <em>Public Employees Mut. Ins. Co. v Sellen Constr. Co. </em>(48 Wash App 792, 740 P2d 913 [1987]), a case similar to the one at bar involving identical contractual provisions, in which the court reached a result consistent with <em>Tishman. </em>There, in interpreting the waiver clause as <em>not barring </em>the carrier\u2019s subrogation claim for non-Work damage, the court concluded that the parties intended that the contractor be required to maintain liability insurance \"covering any damage to non-Work property caused by its construction activities. Likewise, the parties must have intended that [the contractor] <em>not be included as a co-insure[d] </em>on [the owner\u2019s] insurance with respect to any loss that occurred <em>to such non-Work property. </em>[The owner], on the other hand, was to have purchased insurance <em>to cover the Work, </em>and [the contractor] <em>was constructively co-insured [as to this]\u201d (id., </em>at 796, at 915 [emphasis added]).</p>\n<p id=\"b319-7\">Defendants contend, and the dissenters agree, that this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>court\u2019s decision in <em>Trump-Equitable Fifth Ave. Co. v H.R.H. Constr. Corp. </em>(106 AD2d 242, <em>affd </em>66 NY2d 779, <em>supra) </em>supports their construction of the contract and is controlling here. We disagree. As the Appellate Division held, <em>Trump-Equitable </em>is distinguishable. Under the contract at issue in <em>Trump-Equitable, </em>the work to be performed involved the construction of the <em>entire building; </em>the owner was required to procure property insurance for the <em>entire building; </em>therefore,. the owner\u2019s waiver under the subrogation waiver clause extended to damage to the <em>entire building. </em>The contract at issue here, by contrast, is a \"limited scope\u201d construction contract; the Work includes only the exterior walls and the floor of the parking garage; the owner\u2019s responsibility to procure insurance and the corresponding waiver of subrogation rights extend only to those specific areas.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> For the same reason, other cases relied on by defendants and cited by the dissent, involving contracts for the construction of entire buildings, are also inapposite <em>(see, e.g., Tokio Mar. &amp; Fire Ins. Co. v Employers Ins., </em>786 F2d 101 [2d Cir 1986] [citing <em>Trump-Equitable]; South Tippecanoe School Bldg. Corp. v Shambaugh &amp; Son, </em>182 Ind App 350, 395 NE2d 320; <em>Morsches Lbr. v Probst, </em>180 Ind App 202, 388 NE2d 284 [3d Dist 1979]).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> As the Washington court in <em>Public Employees Mut. Ins. Co. v Sellen Constr. Co. </em>(48 Wash App, at 796, 740 P2d, at 915, <em>supra) </em>observed, \"The court cannot ignore the language agreed upon by the parties, or revise or rewrite the contract\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>As plaintiff now concedes, the lower courts properly dismissed its claim to the extent it sought recovery for damages to the Work itself. To the extent plaintiffs insurer, the real party in interest, seeks recovery for damages to property other than the Work, this claim is not barred by plaintiffs waiver in article 17.6.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-5\">Accordingly, the order of the Appellate Division should be affirmed and the certified question answered in the affirmative.</p>\n<author id=\"b321-6\">Alexander, J.</author>\n<p id=\"ALU\">(dissenting). The majority holds today that the subrogation waiver clause in this standard American Institute of Architects (ALA) form contract does not bar the owner\u2019s insurer from seeking recovery from the contractor for property damage to the owner\u2019s building so long as the damage is not to the actual work to be performed under the contract. This limited construction of the subrogation waiver clause is flatly contrary to our construction of an identical clause in <em>Trump-Equitable Fifth Ave. Co. v H.R.H. Constr. Corp. </em>(106 AD2d 242, <em>affd for reasons stated below </em>66 NY2d 779) and undermines the very purpose of the clause. Rather than promoting certainty as to the liability of the parties to these standard contracts, the majority\u2019s construction of this standard waiver clause invites litigation as to whether the damages in any particular case fall within the scope of the work to be performed under the contract. In my view, a construction of the clause to bar the owner from seeking all damages as to which it has obtained insurance under the contract, thereby barring any subrogation action by the owner\u2019s insurer, best effectuates the intent of the parties to the contract. Accordingly, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-7\">The contract allocates the risks of the construction by requiring that the contractor obtain third-party liability insurance and the owner obtain first-party coverage for property damage to \"the entire Work at the site to the full insurable value thereof\u2019 and further providing that the parties waive all rights against each other for damages covered by such insurance. The relevant provisions of article 17, which relates to insurance, are as follows.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-8\">\"17.1 Contractor\u2019s liability insurance shall be purchased and maintained by the Contractor to protect him from claims under the worker\u2019s or workmen\u2019s compensation acts and other employee benefit acts, claims for damages because of bodily injury, including death, and from claims for damages, other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>than to the Work itself, to property which may arise out of or result from the Contractor\u2019s operations under this Contract * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b322-6\">\"17.3 Unless otherwise provided, the Owner shall purchase and maintain property insurance upon the entire Work at the site to the full insurable value thereof. This insurance shall include the interests of the Owner, the Contractor, Subcontractors and Sub-subcontractors in the Work and shall insure against the perils of fire and extended coverage and <em>shall include 1all-risk\u2019 insurance </em>for physical loss or damage including, without duplication of coverage, theft, vandalism, and malicious mischief. * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b322-7\">\"17.6 The Owner and Contractor waive all rights against each other for damages caused by fire or other perils <em>to the extent covered by insurance obtained pursuant to this Article </em>or any other property insurance applicable to the Work, except such rights as they may have to the proceeds of such insurance held by the Owner as trustee.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b322-8\">The owner\u2019s property insurance must provide \"all-risk\u201d coverage and \"includes\u201d, but is not limited to, the respective parties\u2019 interests in the \"Work\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-9\">In <em>Trump-Equitable Fifth Ave. Co. v H.R.H. Constr. Corp. </em>(106 AD2d 242, <em>affd for reasons stated below </em>66 NY2d 779, <em>supra), </em>the Appellate Division concluded that this subrogation waiver clause bars any action by an owner (or an owner\u2019s subrogee) against a contractor for property damage to the subject building falling within the owner\u2019s first-party coverage. Reasoning that a contract provision requiring the contractor to indemnify the owner related only to liability to third parties and thus did not come within the owner\u2019s first-party coverage, the court held that the indemnity and waiver provisions were not in conflict <em>(id., </em>at 244-245; <em>see also, Federal Ins. Co. v Zwicker Elec. Co., </em>144 AD2d 632; <em>Tokio Mar. &amp; Fire Ins. Co. v Employers Ins., </em>786 F2d 101 [2d Cir 1986]). Our affirmance of this reasoning was in no way dependent upon the fact, seized upon by the majority (majority opn, at 236), that the contract in <em>Trump-Equitable </em>related to the construction of an entire building rather than, as in this case, construction work performed on an existing building.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-10\">Nor would such a distinction be meaningful in light of the fact that these subrogation waiver clauses are intended to avoid litigation over claims for damages while also protecting the parties by \"in effect simply requiring] one of the parties <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>to the contract to provide insurance for all of the parties\u201d <em>(Board of Educ. v Valden Assocs., </em>46 NY2d 653, 657; <em>Tokio Mar. &amp; Fire Ins. Co. v Employers Ins., </em>786 F2d, at 104, <em>supra; Haemonetics Corp. v Brophy &amp; Phillips Co., </em>23 Mass App 254, 501 NE2d 524, 526). Here, it is the owner who was required to insure against damage to the building and to waive all claims against the contractor for losses covered by that insurance. I agree with those courts holding that in these circumstances the parties have agreed that the owner\u2019s recovery for these losses is limited to its insurance proceeds and neither the owner, nor its insurer (as subrogee) has any cause of action against the contractor<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>(see, Village of Rosemont v Lentin Lbr. Co., </em>144 111 App 3d 651, 494 NE2d 592; <em>E. C. Long, Inc. v Brennan\u2019s of Atlanta, </em>148 Ga App 796, 252 SE2d 642; <em>Housing Inv. Corp. v Carris, </em>389 So 2d 689 [Fla App 1980]; <em>see also, Insurance Co. v Wells, </em>35 Ohio App 2d 173, 300 NE2d 460; <em>Morsches Lbr. v Probst, </em>180 Ind App 202, 388 NE2d 284 [1979]; <em>South Tippecanoe School Bldg. Corp. v Shambaugh &amp; Son, </em>182 Ind App 350, 395 NE2d 320 [1979]).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> As stated in <em>Housing Inv. Corp. v Carris </em>(389 So 2d, at 690, <em>supra): </em>\"The owner had, as all owners always have, the right to insure his own property for his own exclusive benefit without the consent or agree<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>ment of the contractor or anyone else. Therefore, the only reasonably conceivable purpose of a construction contract provision placing an obligation on the owner to carry insurance is to benefit the contractor by providing him protection and exculpation from risk of liability for the insured loss. Although the contractor was not named as an insured, nor does the contract require this to be done, the contract insurance provision is valuable to the contractor for the very purpose this case exemplifies and serves to limit the owner to insurance proceeds even though the loss was caused by the negligence of the contractor.\u201d Given this allocation of risk agreed upon by the parties, the fact that that insurance coverage is not limited to the actual work performed under the contract is irrelevant <em>(Haemonetics Corp. v Brophy &amp; Phillips Co., supra).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b324-5\">In this case, the \"Work\u201d to be performed is described in the contract, in part, as \"Corrective Work to the Masonry and Concrete Portions of Exterior Walls\u201d and included renovation of brick panels, masonry walls and windows on each of the building\u2019s 38 floors. The limited construction of the subrogation waiver clause adopted by the majority today requires further litigation, and perhaps a trial, to determine the extent to which the damages suffered by plaintiff was related to that Work. In my view, this construction leaves the contractor\u2019s liability uncertain in every case and thus completely undermines the purpose of the subrogation waiver clause. Accordingly, I vote to reverse the order of the Appellate Division and reinstate the judgment of Supreme Court granting summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-6\">Judges Simons, Kaye and Titone concur with Judge Hancock, Jr.; Judge Alexander dissents and votes to reverse in a separate opinion in which Judge Bellacosa concurs; Chief Judge Wachtler taking no part.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-7\">Order affirmed, with costs, and certified question answered in the affirmative.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b318-7\">. For simplicity, where appropriate, defendant and third-party defendant will be referred to collectively as \"defendants\u201d.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b320-5\">. Contrary to the contention of the dissent, the reasoning underlying the holding in <em>Trump-Equitable Fifth Ave. Co. v H.R.H. Constr. Corp. </em>(106 AD2d 242, <em>affd </em>66 NY2d 779) is not that \"a contract provision requiring the contractor to indemnify the owner related only to liability to third parties and thus did not come within the owner\u2019s first-party coverage\u201d <em>(see, </em>dissenting opn, at 238). The court simply construed the contract, which was for the construction of an entire building, as obligating the owner to purchase \"property insurance for damages to the construction project to its full insurable value\u201d (106 AD2d, at 243, <em>supra) </em>and \"to obtain first-party coverage for property loss in the event of damage to the building during [its] construction\u201d <em>(id., </em>at 244-245). Nothing in <em>Trump-Equitable </em>supports the conclusion urged by the dissent that, under the general AIA conditions at issue, the contractor is only responsible for third-party claims. Indeed, such a conclusion is contrary to defendant\u2019s general responsibility to plaintiff for the acts and omissions of its employees under article 10.7 and its specific responsibility under article 17.1 to procure liability insurance for claims for property damage, other than to the Work itself.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b320-6\">. Still other cases cited are inapposite because the contract clauses requiring the owner to procure insurance were broader than the clause here <em>(see, Housing Inv. Corp. v Carris, </em>389 So 2d 689 [Fla App 1980]; <em>Insurance Co. v Wells, </em>35 Ohio App 2d 173, 300 NE2d 460 [1973]).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b323-5\">. The majority\u2019s reliance upon <em>Tishman Co. v Carney &amp; Del Guidiee </em>(34 NY2d 941, <em>affg </em>36 AD2d 273) in support of its contrary construction of the subrogation waiver provision is misplaced (majority opn, at 234-235). <em>Tishman </em>involved whether, absent an insurable interest in the damaged property, a contractor was a coinsured under the owner\u2019s insurance policy so as to bar, <em>by operation of law, </em>a subrogation action against the contractor. In this case, by contrast, plaintiff has <em>agreed, </em>as it was free to do, to limit its recovery to its insurance proceeds and thereby preclude an action by its subrogee. It is of no consequence, therefore, that absent such an agreement, plaintiff\u2019s subrogee would be limited to an action against defendant for damage to property other than the Work <em>(Tishman Co. v Carney &amp; Del Guidice, supra).</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b323-6\"><em>. Public Employees Mut. Ins. Co. v Sellen Constr. Co. </em>(48 Wash App 792, 740 P2d 913 [1987]), cited as contrary authority by the majority (majority opn, at 235), is not persuasive. That case involved damage to microfiche records which were not located at the construction site. While the court concluded that a subrogation action against the contractor was not barred by the subrogation waiver clause because these records did not constitute the \"Work\u201d for which the owner was required to obtain insurance, the decision turned upon the fact that the records were not located at the construction site <em>(id., </em>at 914-915). In fact, the court expressly distinguished <em>Trump-Equitable Fifth Ave. Co. v H.R.H. Constr. Corp. </em>(106 AD2d 242, <em>affd </em>66 NY2d 779) and <em>Village of Rosemont v Lentin Lbr. Co. </em>(144 111 App 3d 651, 494 NE2d 592) by explaining that in those cases \"there was sufficient evidence * * * that the damage was to the Work, i.e., property under construction or property unambiguously located at the construction site\u201d <em>(id.).</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
