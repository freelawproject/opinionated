Citizens Casualty Company of New York et al., 5 Cir. 1970, 431 F.2d 409, Part I.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b835-7\">PER CURIAM:</author>\n<p id=\"b835-8\">Willie Lee Johnson appeals from the district court\u2019s denial of his motion under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 to vacate his conviction and sentence. We dismiss the appeal as not timely filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-9\">On July 24, 1972, the district court denied Johnson\u2019s motion for relief under \u00a7 2255. The appellant did not file a notice of appeal or similar document until October 24, 1972, when this Court received his \u201cpetition of appeal.\u201d This petition was later filed in the district court on November 3, 1972, as a notice of appeal. The appeal proceeded forthwith without further authorization. See Rule 24(a), F.R.A.P.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-10\">Rule 4(a), F.R.A.P., requires that notice of appeal in a case in which the United States is a party be filed within 60 days after the date of entry of the judgment or order sought to be appealed. The Rule further provides, in part, that \u201cUpon a showing of excusable neglect, the district court may extend the time for filing the notice of appeal by any party for a period not to exceed 30 days from the expiration of the time otherwise prescribed by this subdivision.\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b835-11\">Johnson\u2019s \u201cpetition for appeal\u201d was not received by this Court until two days after the 90-day maximum period for filing a notice of appeal had elapsed. This Coiirt, therefore, has no jurisdiction to entertain Johnson\u2019s appeal, and it must be dismissed. Tribbitt v. Wainwright, 5 Cir. 1972, 462 F.2d 600; Dunn v. Henderson, 5 Cir. 1971, 446 F.2d 1398; Bean v. Wainwright, 5 Cir. 1971, 437 F.2d 112.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-12\">Appeal dismissed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b835-13\">. The appellant has not alleged, nor does the record suggest, that his delay resulted from his \u201cexcusable neglect\u201d or from any cause beyond his control. Cf. Tribbitt v. Wainwright, 5 Cir. 1972, 462 F.2d 600.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
