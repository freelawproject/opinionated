Concurrent two year sentences were imposed on each count. On this appeal, Tannenbaum contends that the evidence was insufficient to show that: (1) a connection existed between the misapplication of the bank funds and his status as a bank officer and director, and (2) the entries on the bank ledger were false entries within the meaning of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1005. Having carefully reviewed the record in this case, we find that the jury was properly instructed as to the elements of each offense and that its verdict was amply supported by the evidence. If we were to uphold Tannenbaum\u2019s contentions on the facts of this ease, the criminal statutes involved would become nullities.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-15\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
