After several witnesses had testified the two defendants on trial were permitted by the court to withdraw their pleas of not guilty and to enter pleas of guilty to Count III of the indictment, the count charging knowing and intentional distribution of the Schedule II controlled substance.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b831-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"759\">*759</page-number>After receiving the guilty pleas to Count III the trial judge deferred sentence pending pre-sentence investigation and report. Todd\u2019s sentence, imposed some weeks later, was to confinement in the custody of the Attorney General for two years, plus a special parole term of two years.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-5\">The sole issues <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> raised by appellant which are even arguably appealable are concerned with the sentence imposed by the trial court and with whether or not appellant's motions for post-trial relief and for medical rehabilitation and treatment at a federal treatment center should have been granted. We hold that these questions were addressed to. the trial court\u2019s discretion and will not be disturbed by us on appeal. Withrow v. United States, 5 Cir. 1969, 420 F.2d 1220; Sullivan v. United States, 5 Cir. 1963, 317 F.2d 101; Beitel v. United States, 5 Cir. 1962, 306 F.2d 665. In addition, we note with approval the trial court\u2019s patient attempts \u2014 by setting further hearings and by reserving further rulings \u2014 to give full opportunity for appellant\u2019s counsel to develop facts warranting a commitment or a recommendation for treatment at Lexington, Kentucky, or a similar center for the treatment of drug addiction. Defense counsel simply never furnished any testimony, affidavits, or any indication of the defendant\u2019s addiction other than counsel\u2019s hearsay statements to the court, despite the trial court\u2019s repeated offer to hear further testimony in this respect. We view this appeal as bordering on the frivolous.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-6\">The judgment appealed from is in all respects</p>\n<p id=\"b831-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b830-6\">. Count I of the indictment charged conspiracy under Title 21 U.S.C., \u00a7 846 to violate Section 841(a)(1): Count II charged knowing and intentional possession of a Schedule II controlled substance, 3970 amphetamine tablets, with intent to distribute, in violation of Title 21, U.S.C., \u00a7 841(a)(1) and Title 18, U.S.C., \u00a7 2; and Count III charged knowingly and intentionally distributing the same Schedule II controlled substance, 3970 amphetamine tablets, in violation of Title 21, U.S.C., \u00a7 841(a) (1) and Title 18, U.S.C., \u00a72.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-10\">Since the contentions on appeal are addressed to the trial court\u2019s sentencing discretion we cite from Title 21, U.S.C., \u00a7 841(b)(1)(B), the penalty provisions of the Controlled Substances Act in the case of a controlled substance which is not a narcotic drug. Under the conspiracy charge, Count I, as well as under each of the substantive offenses, Counts II and III, since the appellant was not shown to have a similar prior conviction, the maximum punishment for each count was a term of imprisonment of not more than five years, a fine of not more than $15,000, or both. The statute also requires as an adjunct of any sentence imposing a term of imprisonment a special parole term of at least two years in addition to the term of imprisonment. Thus at the time of the change of plea, Todd\u2019s possible exposure in the event of conviction under Counts I, II and III was to 15 years imprisonment, $45,000 in fines, with at least six years' of special parole time to follow.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b830-18\">. Counts I and II of the indictment were dismissed on the date of sentence as to Todd.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b831-8\">. An additional question raised which we decline to consider, is the adequacy of the fee allowed appellant\u2019s counsel as court-appointed attorney by the trial judge as compensation under Title 18, U.S.C., \u00a7 3006A(b), Criminal Justice Act. This appeal is not the appropriate vehicle for consideration of appointed counsel\u2019s financial complaints. See United States v. Sullivan, 5 Cir. 1972, 456 F.2d 1273, 1275.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
