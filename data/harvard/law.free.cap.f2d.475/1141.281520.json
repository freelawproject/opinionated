In addition, deeming it to be his duty in a habeas case, he has conscientiously catalogued other possible errors for the consideration of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"AaL\">The principal assignment of error, that the state trial court erred in the charge to the jury on voluntary manslaughter (called a due process violation), is, in the context of the total charge, without merit. The additional assignments of error are also without merit.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1213-27\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1213-16\">. The additional assignments of error are the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A26g\">1. Appellant\u2019s conviction for voluntary manslaughter on an indictment charging murder was a violation of due process.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AJ70\">2. Appellant was denied effective assistance of counsel at trial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A9aN\">3. Appellant was arrested in violation of the Fourth Amendment. 4.

Appellant\u2019s conviction was obtained by the use of improperly suggestive identification procedures.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
