The court\u2019s description of appellant\u2019s Exhibit 1 sufficiently conveys the nature of the merchandise:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b726-19\"><em>Exhibit 1, </em>identified as the \u201cGuards Band,\u201d has on the front of the cardboard box an illustration of five marching bandsmen of the British Guard\u2019s Band dressed in ceremonial uniform. On the back of the box is an illustration of the band leader, and next to that a statement that \u201c[t]his set consists of 44 [\u00b6] and OO scale figures, suitable for use with the Air-fix [\u00b6] &amp; OO Trackside series, and are completely finished with the exception of painting.\u201d The contents of the box consist of 44 miniature figures of uniformed musicians playing various * * * musical instruments.2 These figures are complete except for the drummers for whom eight miniature drums are included \u2014 each of which can be snapped into place on the appropriate drummer figure.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b726-20\">The court\u2019s footnote 2 pointed out that \u201c[a]s imported, the individual pieces contained in each set are attached in groups of 9 to 13 to a plastic bar called a \u2018sprue\u2019!\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b726-21\">The merchandise was classified as other toy figures of animate objects (except dolls), not having a spring mechanism, and not stuffed, under item 737.40, TSUS, as modified, T.D. 68-9. Appellant contends that the proper classification of the merchandise should have been as \u201c [construction kits or sets with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>construction units prefabricated to precise scale of the actual article,\u201d under item 737.09, or as articles of plastic, not specially provided for, under item 774.60.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-6\">Upon consideration of the record in this ease and appellant\u2019s arguments, we are in complete agreement with every aspect of the Customs Court\u2019s opinion save one.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-7\">The court pointed out that appellant\u2019s witness testified that \u201cthe sets are made as precisely to [\u00b6] scale, which is in the ratio of 87 to 1, as present-day technology makes possible.\u201d After determining that the merchandise did not fit within the meaning of the term \u201cconstruction kits or sets\" as it is used in item 737.09, the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b727-8\">Also militating against classification of the imports as \u201cconstruction kits or sets with construction units prefabricated to precise scale of the actual article\u201d is that plaintiff failed to establish that the imported articles were, in fact, made to the \u201cprecise scale\u201d of the actual articles. Indeed, examination of the samples indicates to the contrary. For example, checking a few of the samples, the Japanese infantrymen in plaintiff\u2019s exhibit 6 measure approximately Nieth of an inch \u2014 which would mean that at the [\u00b6] scale of 87:1 the actual Japanese infantrymen so depicted would be <em>6\u20199y%\" </em>tall! And although plaintiff\u2019s witness testified that the Japanese figures were slightly smaller than the American figures, many of the American paratroop figures in plaintiff\u2019s exhibit 8, as illustrated, likewise measure %th of an inch, thus depicting American paratroopers of the same heights as the Japanese infantrymen, i.e., 6'9%\".</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b727-9\">It may well be that the actual scale of the figures is significantly different from 87 to 1. But considering the fact that an error in measurement of the figures of i/leth of an inch would result in a calculated error of the height of the original subject of well over 5 inches, we are not convinced that the figures are not made on some \u201cprecise scale\u201d within the meaning of the statute. As appellant points out, \u201c[u]nder TSUS 737.09 there is no specific scale required for classification thereunder \u2014 [\u00b6] or otherwise \u2014 so long as it is made to a \u2018precise scale.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b727-11\">In our view, the remaining findings of the Customs Court are fully supported by the record, and its conclusion that appellant had failed to establish the correctness of either of its claimed classifications is clearly correct. Accordingly, the decision and judgment are <em>affirmed.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b727-12\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b726-22\">. 67 Cust.Ct. 391, C.D. 4302 (1971).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
