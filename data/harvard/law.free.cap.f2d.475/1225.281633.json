United States, 5 Cir. 1969, 407 F.2d 908.</p>\n<p id=\"b1297-28\">\u201cAs we said in <em>Blake </em>\u2018the evidence could go either way.\u2019 Here the jury found that it went against the defendant. The jury need not be bound by defendant\u2019s expert testimony, especially since there are \u2018material variations between the experts themselves * * *.\u2019 Mims v. United States, 5 Cir., 1967, 375 F.2d 135, 143. It was for the jury, not the Court.\u201d United States v.
