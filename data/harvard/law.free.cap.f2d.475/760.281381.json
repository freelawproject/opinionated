The court did not, however, make the certification authorized by Rule 54(b), F.R.Civ.P., that the ruling on the religious issue was final and appealable. Such a certificate is \u201ca jurisdictional prerequisite for an appeal of less than all of the claims in an action.\u201d United States v. Crow, Pope and Land Enterprises, Inc., 5th Cir. 1973, 474 F.2d 200; Fallis v. United States, 5th Cir. 1973, 476 F.2d 619. For lack of a final appealable order this appeal must be and is hereby dismissed.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AjE\">Appeal dismissed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b833-27\">. It is appropriate to dispose of this pro se case summarily, pursuant to this Court\u2019s local Rule 9(c) (2), appellant having failed to file a brief within the time fixed by Rule 31, Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure.
