Bish. Crim. Proc.

It also appeared that in February, 1904, an officer arrested the respondent upon a warrant for stealing another horse, and the State- was permitted to prove under exception, that while he was in custody the officer asked him why he stole these horses, and that he replied that he supposed it was \u201chabit.\u201d As the answer was not induced by threats or promises, but was voluntary, it was admissible. <em>State </em>v. <em>Carr and Loomis, </em>37 Vt. 191; <em>State </em>v. <em>Gorham, </em>67 Vt. 365, 31 Atl. 845. The respondent contends that there was no evidence tending to show what horses were referred to' by the officer, but we think it was competent for the jury to decide whether or not, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>in the circumstances, the respondent understood that the question included the Derby horse.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-5\">2. It appeared that the respondent, soon after his arrest, was taken before a justice of the peace; that he had no counsel and was not advised as to his rights. The State offered and was allowed to prove, subject to exception, that a complaint for this larceny was then read to him, whereupon he said, \u201cI am guilty of that, sir.\u201d It does not appear by the exceptions nor by the record that the respondent made this statement by way of waiving an examination, but voluntarily, upon being informed of the charge, therefore it was properly admitted. See <em>Parker </em>v. <em>Couture, </em>63 Vt. 449, 21 Atl. 494.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-6\">3. The respondent moved for a verdict upon the ground that there was no evidence of a criminal intent. The respondent pretended to hire the horse and wagon to drive to a specified place, yet if he obtained possession thereof under a false pretence of hiring, but with the felonious intention of converting the property to his own use and thereby of permanently depriving the owner o;f it, the taking was criminal. What his intent was at the time of the taking could be learned only from the fact that the property was never returned, and from his statements made after his arrest, if the jury found that the statements were made. It is the general rule that extra-judicial confessions, alone and uncorroborated, are insufficient to establish the <em>corpus </em>delicti, but slight corroboration may be sufficient to establish it. I Bish. Crim. Pro. \u00a7 1058; 5 Am. Crim. Law R. 43, 363. In consideration of the fact that the respondent did not return the property and of his alleged admissions, the court properly denied the motion for a verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-7\">4. The respondent excepted to the omission of the court to\u2019 explain to the jury the meaning of the term \u201creasonable doubt.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b76-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>In Bish. Crim. Pro. \u00a7 1x94, it is said, \u201cThere are no words plainer than reasonable doubt and none so exact to the idea meant.\u201d In the same section the writer says in respect to definitions: \u201cWe have not seen one which can safely be pronounced both helpful and accurate.\u201d In 23 Am. &amp; Eng. Ency. 955, it is said that attempts to define the term are futile; \u201cthat the words are of plain and unmistakable meaning, and that any definition on the part of the court tends only to- confuse the jury and to render uncertain an expression which, standing alone, is certain and intelligible.\u201d This view is sustained in <em>Miles </em>v. <em>U. S., </em>103 U. S. 312; <em>Dunbar </em>v. <em>U. S., </em>156 U. S. 199. In the former case Mr. Justice Woods remarked, that \u201cattempts tO' explain- the term, ' . . . , do not usually result in making it any clearer to the minds of the jury.\u201d Mr. Ereeman, in his notes to <em>Burt </em>v. State, 48 Am. St. R. 563, remarks that nearly every attempt to explain the words renders an explanation of the explanation necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-6\">Some courts have held that the term should be defined. Numerous cases might be cited where definitions have been considered and approved or held erroneous, but the great weight of authority is that no definition of the term need be given.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-7\">\n<em>Judgment that there zvas no error.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
