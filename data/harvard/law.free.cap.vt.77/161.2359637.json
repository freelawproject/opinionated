The plaintiff made the visit February 3, 1903, and then informed Joy that the woman would require attendance for a long time. Joy declined to be further responsible, and by his advice the plaintiff saw one Dyer, another neighbor, who1 tried to communicate by telephone with the defendant\u2019s overseer of the poor, but failing to do so advised the plaintiff to1 continue his visits, saying that he would see the overseer about the matter, but he did not see him until February 15th, when he had an interview with him in the plaintiff\u2019s behalf. The overseer then used language from which it is found that Dyer understood and had a right to understand that the town would assume payment of the plaintiff\u2019s charges and that he so informed the plaintiff. The court found that after the first visit, which was charged to Joy, the plaintiff rendered his services in the <em>expectation </em>that the town would pay him, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>that after Dyer\u2019s report to him, in <em>relimee </em>upon such payment.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-5\">It is apparent that the overseer undertook to assume payment of the plaintiff\u2019s entire bill, but there was no consideration Jor the promise to pay for the services rendered prior to February 15th. They were not rendered upon the overseer\u2019s promise to pay and did not inure to the defendant\u2019s benefit, therefore the defendant is not liable for them, but is liable for the charges made after that date.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-6\"><em>Judgment </em>reversed, <em>and judgment for the plaintiff to recover the amotmt of his bill exclusive of the charges made prior to February </em>15, ipoj.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
