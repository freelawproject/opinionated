All six cases were tried together.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-4\">At the trial it was agreed that on January 25, 1943 a six inch gas main of the defendant had a leak, as a result of which illuminating gas entered the house occupied by the plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-5\">There was evidence introduced by the plaintiffs tending to show the following facts:</p>\n<p id=\"b367-6\">The plaintiffs all lived in a one-family house at 38 Edge-mere Road, West Roxbury. On January 23, 1943 a peculiar sweet odor was noticed in the house, especially near the cellar door. A load of coal had been delivered that day and it was .thought the odor came from that. On the following day, January 24th, the same sweet smell was noticed many times, especially near the back door. That night the plaintiff Mrs. Dorothy Kelble, mother of the five minor plaintiffs, felt dizzy. At 11 P. M. she went to bed leaving some windows open.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-7\">At 5:30 A. M. on January 25, 1943 the smell in the cellar was still there. Beginning at about 6:45 A. M. on that morning the plaintiffs became ill. The police were called to the house. They opened the windows and notified the Gas Co., which sent its men at once. They dug a hole in the street and worked there all day. The hole was open for about a week. A doctor was called who treated all the plaintiffs, and, according to his medical report which was admitted in evidence without objection, all the plaintiffs were injured by, and suffered from, inhalation of illuminating gas.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-8\">The report of this case contains the following statements:</p>\n<p id=\"b367-9\">\u201cAt various times before the day of this accident some men were seen digging at divers other points not far from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>the plaintiffs\u2019 home on Edgemere Road accompanied by a truck reading \u2018Boston Consolidated Cas Company.\u2019 The Court <em>inferred </em>from all the testimony that these diggings were near the scene of the accident and that they had <em>occurred within a short time prior to the accident.\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b368-3\">The defendant offered no evidence except medical testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-4\">The defendant duly filed the two following requests for rulings:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b368-5\"><em>1. </em>The evidence does not warrant a finding that the defendant was negligent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b368-6\"><em>2. </em>The doctrine of <em>res ipso loquitur </em>does not apply to the facts in this case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b368-7\">The Court made the following finding on request number 1. \u201cI find the defendant corporation was negligent.\u201d It took no action on request number 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-8\">The Court found for the plaintiff in each of the six cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-9\">The defendant, claiming to be aggrieved by the action of the Court on its request number 1 and by the failure of the Court to act on request number 2, the case was reported to this Appellate Division.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-10\">In its brief (page 4), and in its oral argument, the defendant waived the second request for rulings and relied upon its first request only. We, therefore, consider only the first request.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-11\">The only question of law presented for our determination is whether or not there is any evidence which would warrant the special finding of the trial judge that the defendant Gras Company was negligent, and his general findings for the several plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-12\">The plaintiffs contend that these findings were warranted on the following two grounds:</p>\n<p id=\"b369-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number><em>First. </em>The mere fact that gas escaped from a pipe of the defendant is <em>prima facie </em>evidence of its negligence, and not having been rebutted, is sufficient to warrant the findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-3\"><em>Second. </em>Even if the escape of gas is not, alone and by itself, sufficient to warrant a finding of negligence, yet there was, in the instant case, <em>other </em>evidence of negligence, adequate to sustain the findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-4\">We will consider these contentions in the above order.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-5\">The first contention is based upon the authority of the case of <em>Smith v. Boston Gas Light Co., </em>129 Mass. 318 and on what we believe was only a <em>dictum </em>in that case. On page 320 of that case it is. said, \u201cThe judge ruled at the trial \u2018that there was evidence enough of want of proper care on the part of the defendant to make it responsible, on the ground that it was bound to conduct the gas in a proper manner; <em>and that the fact that the gas escaped was prima facie evidence of some neglect on the part of the defendant.\u2019 </em>Taking the <em>whole ruling, </em>we cannot say it was wrong.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b369-6\">On page 321 it is further stated \u201cBut beside this, there was in the case at bar some evidence that the pipes were not laid with sufficient care, or made of proper material with reference to the action of the frost, and were, therefore, more liable to break in the winter time, when this accident occurred. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b369-7\">Our Supreme Court evidently considers that the statement in the Smith ease that \u201cthe fact that gas escaped was <em>prima facie </em>evidence of some neglect\u201d is merely <em>dictum. Goldman vs. City of Boston, </em>274 Mass. 329, 331, 332.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-8\">We feel that there is no authority which compels us to accept the plaintiffs\u2019 first contention and we further feel that fairness and justice oblige us to deny it.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-9\">Gas Companies are not absolutely liable for the escape of gas without regard to the question of negligence or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>bound at their peril not to permit the escape of gas. See <em>Smith v. Boston Gas Light Co., </em>129 Mass. 318, at page 320.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-3\">Such Companies are bound to exercise care in the location, construction, repair and maintenance of the mains and pipes used to conduct gas, and the degree of such care is commensurate with the dangerous character of the gas it conducts. <em>Smith v. Boston Gas Light Co., </em>129 Mass. 318. <em>Finnegan v. Fall River Gas Works Co., </em>159 Mass. 311, 312. <em>American Law Inst. Restatement Torts, \u00a7 </em>293 (c).</p>\n<p id=\"b370-4\">But to hold that the mere escape of gas from a pipe or main laid in a public way is without more, <em>prima facie </em>evidence of negligence of the Cas Co. is unfair and unjust. It is true that the Cas Companies have exclusive control of the pipes so laid in the streets, but it is also true that they have no control of the streets themselves, either of the surface or of the ground beneath. They cannot control or prevent the passing of extra heavy vehicles such as steam rollers or steam shovels over the surface or the digging for or bursting of water or sewer pipes beneath the surface, and perhaps in close proximity to the gas mains.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-5\">We believe the law to be that in order to prevail the plaintiff must prove some negligence beyond the mere existence of a leak.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-6\">The plaintiffs \u2019 second contention that there was evidence of negligence <em>other </em>than the mere existence of the leak is evidently based upon that part of the Report relating to diggings in Edgemere Road <em>prior </em>to the time gas was noticed in the plaintiff\u2019s house. The Court <em>found </em>that at various times before the accident men were seen digging in the street <em>not far </em>from the plaintiff\u2019s house and <em>inferred </em>that the digging\u2019s occurred within a short time prior to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>accident. These men were accompanied by a truck reading, \u201cBoston Consolidated Gas Co.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b371-3\">Even if we presume that the <em>inference </em>that the diggings occurred a short time prior to the accident, was equivalent to a finding to that effect, and that the presence of the truck with the defendant\u2019s name on it was sufficient proof of the fact that the men digging were the defendant\u2019s employees engaged on the defendant\u2019s business, yet all this evidence falls short of proving any negligence on the part of the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-4\">If this evidence has any value at all it is because it tends to show that th\u00e9 defendant had, or ought to have had, prior knowledge of the leak that caused the injury to the plaintiffs and failed to repair it effectually. But the evidence does not prove this.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-5\">The record does not disclose how many gas pipes the defendant maintained on this street. The diggings may have been in connection with another gas pipe or may have been to install a connection between this gas main, or another main, with a private residence. The leak may have been caused by bursting of underground water or sewer pipes of which the defendant had, or could have had, no knowledge.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-6\">It is true that the defendant knew the exact time, location and purpose of these prior diggings and that the plaintiffs did not.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-7\">Furthermore the defendant apparently deliberately refrained from offering any evidence to enlighten the trial judge oil this matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-8\">But it is also true that a defendant cannot be condemned for failure to rebut evidence when there is no pertinent evidence to rebut and its failure to offer testimony under these circumstances is no basis for drawing an inference <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>against it. <em>Bishop v. Pastorelli, </em>240 Mass. 104, 107. <em>Porcino v. DeStefano, </em>243 Mass. 398, 401. <em>Hinds v. Bowen, </em>268 Mass. 55, 59.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-3\">It follows that the denial of the defendant\u2019s request was prejudicial error.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-4\">We do not feel that justice required us to order findings for the defendant in these cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-5\">The findings for the plaintiffs in all the cases are vacated and new trials ordered in all cases.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
