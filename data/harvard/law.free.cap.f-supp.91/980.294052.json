S.C.A., plaintiff, a Virginia corporation, complained of the Alabama defendants and prayed for both temporary and permanent injunctive relief against them.</p>\n<p id=\"b1030-23\">Plaintiff\u2019s basic insistence is that the revenue derived from the operation of its passenger trains Nos. <em>7 </em>and 8 between Tuscumbia, Alabama, and 'Chattanooga, Tennessee, is grossly disproportionate to the direct expenses and that the continuation of such train service is not demanded or required by the public necessities.</p>\n<p id=\"b1031-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"983\">*983</page-number>Alleging the exhaustion of administrative remedies, plaintiff exhibits its petition for a permit allowing abandonment of such service, filed with defendant, Alabama Public Service Commission, September 13, 1948, pursuant to the requirements of Title 48, \u00a7\u00a7 35 and 106, Code of Alabama 1940. There follow averments calculated to show undue delay in the hearing and consideration of the petition culminating in an adverse order entered by defendant Commission on April 3, 1950.</p>\n<p id=\"b1031-5\">Emphasizing the impact of the Commission\u2019s order within the framework of the statutory scheme of regulating transportation companies, Title 48, Code of Alabama 1940, plaintiff makes clear that it is impaled on the horns of a dilemma. If it continues the operation of such trains, it will lose substantial sums of money. If it ignores the Commission\u2019s order and abandons such services, it will face the imposition of severe sanctions under pertinent statutes. Either course, it complains, will result in irreparable damage unless this court grants injunctive relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b1031-6\">Following the constitution of a three-judge district court in conformity with the provisions of Title 28, \u00a7 2281, U.S.C.A., this action was, on May 8, 1950, set down for a hearing on plaintiff\u2019s prayer for a temporary injunction at Montgomery, Alabama, on May 22, 1950.</p>\n<p id=\"b1031-7\">Upon its convocation, this court was met at the threshold with three several motions, in which all defendants joined, raising certain adjective problems relating to the jurisdiction of the court, the propriety of exercising such jurisdiction as it might be found to have, and the right of plaintiff to injunctive relief in any event.</p>\n<p id=\"b1031-8\">At the conclusion of oral arguments, the court, after consultation, announced its opinion that each of such motions was due to be overruled for reasons thereafter to be stated. Whereupon, it was stipulated by counsel for the parties that evidence should be adduced and the case submitted upon plaintiff\u2019s prayer for a permanent injunction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1031-9\">I. Adopting a literal construction of the following language of Title 28, \u00a7 2281, U.S.C.A.: \u201cAn interlocutory or permanent injunction restraining the enforcement, operation or execution of any State statute by restraining the action of any officer of such State in the enforcement or execution of such statute or of an order made by an administrative board or commission acting under State statutes, shall not be granted by any district court or judge thereof upon the ground of the unconstitutionality of such statute unless the application therefor is heard and determined by a district court of three judges under section 2284 of this title. [June 25, 1948, c. 646, 62 Stat. 968.]\u201d defendants challenge the jurisdiction of this District Court of three judges because no attack is leveled at the constitutionality of the State statutes under which the defendant Commission acted. Since, it is argued, plaintiff does not seek an adjudication of unconstitutionality of such statutes, but relies squarely upon the assertion that the order of the defendant Commission denying plaintiff the right to abandon the passenger train service concerned is confiscatory in effect and therefore violative of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States, the quoted statute is manifestly inapplicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b1031-11\">Dispositive of this contention is Oklahoma Natural Gas Co. v. Russell, 1923, 261 U.S. 290, 43 S.Ct. 353, 67 L.Ed. 659, in which Mr. Justice Holmes, delivering the opinion for a unanimous court, stated: \u201cA doubt has been suggested whether these cases are within Sec. 266 of the Judicial Code, Act of March 3, 1911, c. 231, 36 Stat. 1087, 1162; as amended by the Act of March 4, 1913, c. 160, 37 Stat. 1013. The section originally forbade interlocutory injunctions restraining the action of state officers in the enforcement or execution of any statute of a State, upon the ground of its unconstitutionality, without a hearing by three judges. The amendment inserted after the words \u2018enforcement or execution of such statute\u2019 the words \u2018or in the enforcement or execution of an order made by an administrative board or commission acting under and pursuant to the statutes of such State\u2019 but did not change the statement of the ground, which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"984\">*984</page-number>still reads .\u2018the unconstitutionality of such statute.\u2019 So if the section is construed with narrow precision it may be argued that the unconstitutionality of the order is not enough. But this Court has assumed repeatedly that the section was to be taken more broadly. Louisville &amp; Nashville R. R. Co. v. Finn, 235 U.S. 601, 604, 35 S.Ct. 146, 59 L.Ed. 379; Phoenix Ry. Co. v. Geary, 239 U.S. 277, 280, 281, 36 S.Ct. 45, 60 L.Ed. 287; Cumberland Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. v. Louisiana Public Service Commission, 260 U.S. 212, 43 S.Ct. 75, 67 L.Ed. 217; Western &amp; Atlantic R.R. v. Railroad Commission of Georgia, 261 U.S. 264, 43 S.Ct. 252, 67 L.Ed. 645. The amendment seems to have been introduced to prevent any question that such orders were within the section. It was superfluous, as the original statute covered them. Louisville &amp; Nashville R.R. Co. v. Garrett, 231 U.S. 298, 301, 318, 34 S.Ct. 48, 58 L.Ed. 229; Atlantic Coast Line R.R. Co. v. Golds-boro, 232 U.S. 548, 555, 34 S.Ct. 364, 58 L.Ed. 721; Grand Trunk Western Ry. Co. v. Railroad Commission of Indiana, 221 U. S. 400, 403, 31 S.Ct. 537, 55 L.Ed. 786. But it plainly was intended to enlarge not to restrict the law. We mention the matter simply to put doubts to rest.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1032-6\">We hold that a Federal three-judge district court has jurisdiction to entertain a complaint alleging the unconstitutionality of an order of an administrative board or commission, acting under a State statute and praying for injunctive relief against the enforcement, operation or execution of such order, although no attack is made upon the validity of the statute itself.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1032-7\">II. Insisting that this court should herein decline to exercise its juris-' diction, defendants first invoke the familiar doctrine of exhaustion of administrative remedies. Pointing to the provisions of Title 48, \u00a7 79 et seq., Code of Alabama 1940, defendants assert that the appellate procedure therein provided is a part of the administrative process.</p>\n<p id=\"b1032-12\">We do not agree. In Avery Freight Lines, Inc. v. Persons, 1947, 250 Ala. 40, 32 So.2d 886, 889, the Supreme Court of Alabama, in holding that an appeal to the Circuit Court under the statutes concerned was judicial and not legislative or administrative, observed: \u201cUnder the foregoing statutes * * * r the circuit court can do only three things. (1) It can affirm the order of the Public Service Commission. (2) It can set aside the order of the Public Service Commission. (3) \u25a0 It can remand the case to the Public Service Commission for further proceedings in conformity with the direction of the court. The legislature evidently did not intend \u2018that the reviewing court should put itself in the place of the commission, try the matter anew as an administrative body, weigh the evidence and substitute its finding and judgment on the merits as that of the commission.\u2019 State ex rel. Anderson Motor Service Co. v. Public Service Commission, 234 Mo.App. 470, 134 S.W.2d 1069, 1076; Id., 348 Mo. 613, 154 S.W.2d 777; 51 C.J. p. 758. See Alabama Public Service Commission v. Crow, 247 Ala. 120, 22 So. 2d 721.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1032-13\">After discussing a similar statutory design for judicial review of administrative orders in Bacon, et al. Public Service Comm. of State of Vermont v. Rutland Railroad Co., 1914, 232 U.S. 134, 138, 34 S.Ct. 283, 284, 58 L.Ed. 538, the court said: \u201cIt is apparent on the face of these sections that they do not attempt to confer legislative powers : upon the court. They only provide an alternative and more expeditious' way of doing what might be done by a bill in equity. Whether the alternative is exclusive or concurrent, whether it opens matters that would not be open upon a bill or not, if exceptions are taken (which does not appear in this case), is immaterial; the remedy in any event is purely judicial: to exonerate the appellant from an order that exceeds the law. This, we understand, is the view taken by the supreme <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"985\">*985</page-number>\u25a0court of the state, Bacon v. Boston &amp; Maine R. R., 83 Vt. 421, 457, 76 A. 128; Sabre v. Rutland R. R. Co., 86 Vt. 347, 368, 369, 85 A. 693, [Ann.Cas. 1915C, 1269]; and this being so, by the rule laid down in Prentis v. Atlantic Coast Line Co. [211 U.S. 210, 29 S.Ct. 67, 53 L.Ed. 150], the railroad - company was free to assert its rights in the district court of the United States.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1033-5\">We hold that defendant -Commission\u2019s order denying plaintiffs petition terminated the administrative process, entitling plaintiff to resort immediately to this court for relief.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The failure of plaintiff to apply for a rehearing does not affect the result. Title 48, \u00a7 76, Code of Alabama 1940, permits an application for a rehearing before the Commission but does not require it. No Alabama case has \u00a1been called to our attention, we have found none, 'holding that such an application must have been made before resorting to the statutory procedure for appeals to the State courts, to which we have referred. Moreover, in the absence of a statutory requirement making application for a rehearing a condition precedent to the right of judicial review, plaintiff was authorized to proceed in this -court without first having availed itself of such a privilege.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1033-6\">There is no merit in defendants\u2019 insistence that plaintiff must perforce litigate the validity of the alleged confiscatory order in the State courts. Jurisdiction of this court has been invoked- by facts properly pleaded. Plaintiff had a choice of forums. It could have prosecuted an appeal to the Circuit Court of Montgomery, Alabama, Title 48, \u00a7 79, Code of Alabama 1940, or it could have invoked the jurisdiction of this court in a plenary suit. We \u25a0hold that, after the judicial stage is reached, a complainant alleging an order of a State commission to be confiscatory in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment may seek the protection of a Federal court even though the State law affords like procedure in the State courts.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1033-13\"> Conceding <em>arguendo </em>its jurisdiction, defendants urge this court to abstain from its exercise both under the principle of comity between Federal and State courts and under the doctrine of discretionary abstention. But \u201crules of comity or convenience must give way to constitutional rights.\u201d Oklahoma Natural Gas Co. v. Russell, supra, 261 U.S. 290, 293, 43 S.Ct. 353, 354. Since no suit is pending at this time in any of the courts of the State of Alabama between the parties to, or involving the subject matter of, this litigation, we hold that rules of comity are inapplicable. Southern Railway Co. v. Alabama Public Service Comm., D.C.1950, 88 F.Supp. 441.</p>\n<p id=\"b1033-14\">There is ample authority to the effect that if questions of novel, ambiguous or undecided State law are involved in a pending action and it appears that a State court adjudication would decide or render <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"986\">*986</page-number>unnecessary the decision of Federal questions, the Federal court should retain jurisdiction but withhold its decision pending determination of the matter by the State court with reasonable promptness.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> We agree that the district court should stay its hand where the Federal question may not survive the decision of the State court as to the local law. But defendants cite no ambiguous, novel or undecided State law involved herein. The authority of the Commission to issue the order is not questioned. The statute under which it acted is not attacked. The Alabama law requires no definite construction or authoritative interpretation. Alabama Public Service Commission v. Atlantic Coast Line R. Co., Ala. Sup., 45 So.2d 449. We hold that the doctrine of discretionary abstention does not apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b1034-4\">III. Maintaining that the allegations of the complaint afford no basis for injunctive relief in any event, defendants advert to the negative form of the Commission\u2019s order and assert that the effect of an injunction would be to interfere with the enforcement of State criminal statutes contrary to time-honored principles of equity.</p>\n<p id=\"b1034-5\">It is conceded that the order is negative in form,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> but its legal effect could hardly be more positive. Viewed against the statutory scheme adopted by the State to regulate transportation companies, such order is conclusive evidence that plaintiff has done all it could under the State law to get relief and could not get it. To save itself front irreparable damage it must violate the State\u2019s criminal law and submit to its sanctions if State officers do their duty. This, equity does not require. Stripped of artificiality, the order amounts to a stark command by the State that plaintiff continue to furnish the train services involved or suffer the consequences of their abandonment. In view of the findings of fact and conclusions of law, infra,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> we hold that in its impact on plaintiff\u2019s business it is affirmative in nature, having the practical effect of confiscating plaintiff\u2019s property in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment, and that it is clearly not within the rule of the cases relied upon by defendants.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1034-14\">Equally tenuous is defendants\u2019 contention that the injunction prayed for would restrain enforcement of the criminal laws of Alabama in an unwarranted manner. To impart reality to the protection afforded plaintiff by the Fourteenth Amendment it is essential that this court restrain defendants from seeking to impose the sanctions of fines, penalties and forfeitures provided in Title 48, Code of Alabama 1940. We are without jurisdiction to grant the relief which the Commission wrongfully withheld, namely, permission for plaintiff to abandon these train services. We are warranted in assuming that should we decline to interfere with the enforcement of the criminal laws of Alabama plaintiff would continue to operate these trains at a serious and growing loss, for while the threat of prosecution may be a goad, it is not the only inducement to law observance. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"987\">*987</page-number>Thus, it is not the threat of a multiplicity of prosecutions, but the finding of irreparable damage to plaintiff\u2019s property rights that is real, not fanciful, immediate, not remote, which moves us to grant an injunction. We know of no other manner of affording the relief to which plaintiff is entitled.</p>\n<p id=\"b1035-5\">Defendants rely heavily upon the following statement in Beal, County Attorney of Douglas County, Nebraska, et al. v. Missouri Pac. R. Corp., 1941, 312 U.S. 45, 61 S.Ct. 418, 420, 85 L.Ed. 577: \u201cIt is a familiar rule that courts of equity do not ordinarily restrain criminal prosecutions. In re Sawyer, 124 U.S. 200, 211, 8 S.Ct. 482, 488, 31 L.Ed. 402; Davis &amp; Famum Mfg. Co. v. Los Angeles, 189 U.S. 207, 23 S.Ct. 498, 47 L.Ed. 778; Hygrade Provision Co. v. Sherman, 266 U.S. 497, 500, 45 S.Ct. 141, 69 L.Ed. 402. No citizen or member of the community is immune from prosecution, in good faith, for his alleged criminal acts. The imminence of such a prosecution even though alleged to be unauthorized and hence unlawful is not alone ground for relief in equity which exerts its extraordinary powers only to prevent irreparable injury to the plaintiff who seeks its aid. Terrace v. Thompson, 263 U.S. 197, 214, 44 S.Ct. 15, 17, 68 L.Ed. 255; Packard v. Banton, 264 U.S. 140, 143, 44 S.Ct. 257, 258, 68 L.Ed. 596; Tyson &amp; Bro. [United Theatre Ticket Offices] v. Banton, 273 U. S. 418, 428, 47 S.Ct. 426, 427, 71 L.Ed. 718, 58 A.L.R. 1236; Cline v. Frink Dairy Co., 274 U.S. 445, 452, 47 S.Ct. 681, 682, 71 L.Ed. 1146.\u201d But is was also said in the Beal case, supra: \u201c * * * that in view of the state of the record and certain concessions made by counsel on the argument here any further hearing of the issue of irreparable injury to respondent from a threatened multiplicity of suits has been waived. The reversal will accordingly be with instructions to the district court to dismiss the bill of complaint.\u201d In the case at bar there was no concession or waiver of any claim of irreparable injury resulting from a multiplicity of suits or the deprivation of property without due process of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b1035-6\">We hold that this case falls within the exception to the general rule and find apposite the following language in Cline v. Frink Dairy Co. [1927], 274 U.S. 445, 47 S.Ct. 681, 682, 71 L.Ed. 1146: \u201c* * * The general rule is that a court of equity is without jurisdiction to restrain criminal proceedings to try the same right that is in issue before it; but an exception to this rule exists when the prevention of such prosecutions under alleged unconstitutional enactments is essential to the safeguarding of rights of property, and when the circumstances are exceptional and the danger of irreparable loss is both great and immediate. Fenner v. Boykin, 271 U.S. 240, 243, 46 S.Ct. 492, 70 L.Ed. 927; Packard v. Banton, 264 U.S. 140, 44 S.Ct. 257, 68 L. Ed. 596; Hygrade Provision Co. v. Sherman, 266 U.S. 497, 502, 45 S.Ct. 141, 69 L. Ed. 402; Terrace v. Thompson, 263 U.S. 197, 214, 44 S.Ct. 15, 68 L.Ed. 255; Ex parte Young, 209 U.S. 123, 28 S.Ct. 441, 52 L.Ed. 714, 13 L.R.A., N.S., 932, 14 Ann.Cas. 764; Davis &amp; Famum Mfg. Co. v. Los Angeles, 189 U.S. 207, 218, 23 S.Ct. 498, 47 L.Ed. 778; Dobbins v. Los Angeles, 195 U.S. 223, 236, 241, 25 S.Ct. 18, 49 L.Ed. 169. In re Sawyer, 124 U.S. 200, 209, 211, 8 S.Ct. 482, 31 L.Ed. 402.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1035-7\">Proceeding to the merits of the case, we hold that plaintiff is entitled to the relief for which it prays and enter the following findings of fact and conclusions of law:</p>\n<p id=\"b1035-8\">Findings of Fact</p>\n<p id=\"b1035-9\">1. Plaintiff, Southern Railway Company, is a corporation organized and existing under the laws of the State of Virginia, is engaged as a common carrier by railroad of persons and property between points within the State of Alabama, and between points within the State of Alabama on the one hand and points in other states throughout the South on the other hand, and is subject to the jurisdiction of the Alabama Public Service Commission and the Interstate Commerce Commission, respectively.</p>\n<p id=\"b1035-10\">2. The defendant, Alabama Public Service Commission, consisting of a president and two associate commissioners, is an administrative body created under the laws <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"988\">*988</page-number>of the State of Alabama, Title 48, \u00a7 1, Code of Alabama 1940, and thereby authorized to exercise certain regulatory powers over plaintiff, Title 48, \u00a7 106, Code of Alabama 1940. The principal office and official domicile of said Commission is located in the City of Montgomery, being within the Northern Division of the Middle Judicial District of the State of Alabama. Title 48, \u00a7 11, Code of Alabama 1940. Defendant Persons is President, and defendants Hitchcock and Owen are Associate Commissioners of said Commission and are citizens of the State of Alabama and residents of the City of Montgomery.</p>\n<p id=\"b1036-4\">3. The defendant Carmichael is Attorney General for the State of Alabama, and is a citizen of the State of Alabama and resident of the City of Montgomery. Defendant Carmichael, as Attorney General of the State of Alabama, is by the statutes of said state charged with the supervision and control of legal proceedings in behalf of the State of Alabama and is attorney for defendant, Alabama Public Service Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b1036-5\">4. This is a suit of a civil nature between citizens of different states and arises under the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States. The matter in controversy, exclusive of interest and cost, exceeds the sum of $3,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b1036-6\">5. Plaintiff complied with Title 48, \u00a7\u00a7 35 and 106, Code of Alabama 1940, on the 13th day of September, 1948, by filing with defendant Commission an application for authority to discontinue the operation of two local intrastate passenger trains being operated daily between Tuscumbia, \u2018Alabama, and Chattanooga, Tennessee.</p>\n<p id=\"b1036-7\">6. The defendant Commission set said application down for hearing at Huntsville, Alabama, for June 2, 1949. The hearing was continued by the Commission until August 4, 1949, and again until October 6, 1949, when it was heard by two representatives of the Commission, none of the defendant commissioners being present thereat.</p>\n<p id=\"b1036-8\">7. On April 3, 1950, the Commission entered its report and order and denied plaintiff\u2019s application.</p>\n<p id=\"b1036-9\">8. Plaintiff seeks a temporary and permanent injunction against the defendants, separately and severally, from proceeding to enforce sanctions provided under the laws of the State of Alabama for the failure or refusal of plaintiff to continue the operation of local passenger trains Nos. 7 and 8 within the State of Alabama in violation of order No. 11988, entered by defendant Commission April 3, 1950, and that said order be declared unlawful, null, void and of no effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b1036-10\">9. On September 13, 1948, a notice was posted at each affected station in Alabama that plaintiff had petitioned the Alabama Public \u25a0 Service Commission for authority to discontinue local trains Nos. 7 and 8. These notices remained posted for a period of ten days in compliance with the rule of defendant Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b1036-11\">10. Local train No. 7 leaves Chattanooga, Tennessee, and makes scheduled or flag stops at the following towns in Alabama: Stevenson, Fackler, Plollywood, Scottsboro, Larkinsville, Limrock, Woodville, Paint Rock, Gurley, Brownsboro, Chase, Huntsville, Madison, Belle Mina, Decatur, Trinity, Hillsboro, Wheeler, Courtland, Town Creek, Leighton, and Sheffield-Tuscumbia. Local train No. 8 makes the same trip in reverse, starting at Sheffield-Tuscumbia and ending at Chattanooga, Tennessee.</p>\n<p id=\"b1036-12\">11. Train No. 7 leaves Chattanooga, Tennessee, at 4:15 p. m. and arrives at Sheffield-Tuscumbia, Alabama, at 9:05 p. m. Train No. 8 leaves Sheffield-Tuscum-bia, Alabama, at 5:55 a. m. and arrives at Chattanooga, Tennessee, at 10:50 a. m.</p>\n<p id=\"b1036-13\">'12. In addition to local trains Nos. 7 and 8, plaintiff operates trains Nos. 35 and 36, and trains Nos. 45 and 46 between Chattanooga, Tennessee, and Sheffield-Tuscum-bia, Alabama. Train No. 35 leaves Chattanooga, Tennessee, at 7:00 a. m. and arrives at Sheffield-Tuscumbia, Alabama, at 12:20 p. m. Train No. 36 leaves Sheffield-Tuscumbia, Alabama, at 12:40 p. m. and arrives at Chattanooga, Tennessee, at 6:00 p. m.. Train No. 45 leaves Chattanooga, Tennessee, at 11:50 p. m. and arrives at Sheffield-Tuscumbia, Alabama, at 4:10 a. m. Train No. 46 leaves Sheffield-Tuscum-bia, Alabama, at 11:10 p. m. and arrives <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"989\">*989</page-number>at Chattanooga, Tennessee, at 3:10 a. m. Trains Nos. 35 and 36 make a scheduled stop or flag stop at the following towns in Alabama: Stevenson, Fackler, Hollywood, Scottsboro, Larkinsville, Limrock, Woodville, Paint Rock, Gurley, Browns-boro, Chase, Huntsville, Madison, Belle Mina, Decatur, Trinity, Hillsboro, Wheeler, Courtland, Town Creek, Leighton to Sheffield-Tuscumbia. Trains Nos. 45 and 46 make a scheduled stop or flag stop at Chattanooga, Tennessee, and the following towns in Alabama: Stevenson, Scottsboro, Huntsville, Decatur and Sheffield-Tuscum-bia.</p>\n<p id=\"b1037-6\">13.
