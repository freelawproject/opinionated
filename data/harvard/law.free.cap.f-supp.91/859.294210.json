It is here on cross-motions for summary judgment. A stipulation<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>'was filed from which the following facts have, in substance, been found.</p>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b908-6\">1. Plaintiff, .Nemours Corporation, is a Delaware corporation organized in 1924. It is a personal holding company as defined by the applicable Federal Revenue Acts, holding investments in securities, real estate and oil and gas properties. During the taxable year involved, its total outstanding stock consisted of 36,172 no par value shares, of which 28,923 shares were held by Paulina duPont Dean and 7,249 by her husband, J. Simpson Dean. During 1936 the directors were Paulina duPont Dean, J. Simpson Dean and S. Hallock duPont. The charter of the corporation was amended in December, 1925, increasing the authorized common stock from 10,000 shares of no par value to 20,000 shares of no par value. A further amendment in December, 1927, increased the common stock from 20,000 shares of no par value to 50,000 shares of no par value.</p>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b908-7\">2. On May 7, 1943, plaintiff filed, with the Collector of Internal Revenue for the District of Delaware, a claim for refund of undistributed profits tax paid for the calendar year 1936. Plaintiff was advised by letter dated August 18, 1945, that said claim for refund was disallowed in full. This suit was brought within two years from that date. , .</p>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b908-9\">3. On March 15, 1937; plaintiff filed with the Collector of Internal Revenue for the District of Delaware, its income tax return for the calendar year 1936, prepared on a cash basis. The following tax liability of $41,904.48 shown by the return was paid to the- Collector:</p>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b908-10\">March 17, 1937 $10,476.12</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AeZ\">June 15, 1937 10.476.12</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"A4k\">September 15, 1937 10.476.12</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"AH4\">December 15, 1937 <em>10.476.12</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b908-15\">Thereafter, as a result of audit, the Commissioner of Internal Revenue determined plaintiff\u2019s federal income tax liability for the calendar year 1936 was the following:</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"p\" id=\"b908-16\">Normal tax $ 3,064.12</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b908-17\">Undistributed profits tax 39,044.24</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b908-18\">Total' $42,108.36</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b908-19\">This finding of tax liability was based upon the determination by the Commissioner that the plaintiff\u2019s net income, as shown by the return filed in the amount of $361,988.82,- should be increased to $362,-650.01, a difference of $661.19. This was because of certain adjustments not here material. After deducting from the- $362,-650.01 figure, the normal income tax thereon of $3,064.12, as well as the credit for dividends paid during the year, namely $128,410.60, it was held that plaintiff\u2019s undistributed net income was $231,175.29 and that the undistributed profits tax due thereon was $39,044.24.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b908-20\">4. The difference between plaintiff\u2019s total tax liability for the year of $42,108.36, as determined by the Commissioner, and the $41,904.48 paid as later noted, or $203.-88, was duly paid by the plaintiff. In the year 1936, plaintiff sold for a total of $434,-753.77 certain securities which had cost it $672,267.40. A loss, of $237,513.63 was thereby sustained.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b908-21\">5. Although this loss reduced plaintiff\u2019s earnings and profits, in the determination of plaintiff\u2019s net income subject to normal tax as well as its undistributed net income subject to undistributed profits tax, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"861\">*861</page-number>plaintiff was permitted, by the effective Revenue Act, to claim as a deduction only $2,000.00 of this loss of $237,513.63. Plaintiff\u2019s earnings and profits for the taxable year 1936, without considering the matters contained in the next paragraph, which plaintiff contends should decrease such earnings and profits, were $133,263.45.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b909-5\">6. Plaintiff also claims that as of the end of 1936, there should be a further deduction from the earnings and profits of that year of $15,077.63, which it describes as \u201creal estate repairs, insurance and depreciation\u201d. Plaintiff did not claim and was not allowed this deduction in computing its taxable income for 1936. Title to the real estate involved was transferred to plaintiff by plaintiff\u2019s principal stockholder (Paulina duPont Dean) in 1931 as the result of a request by the Chase National Bank of New York, for the purpose of improving the credit position of plaintiff, which was at that time indebted to the bank in the sum of $600,000. The real estate was a residential property occupied without payment of any rental at all times from at least 1931 to the present by J. Simpson Dean and his wife, Paulina duPont Dean, who, as stated, were the sole stockholders of plaintiff. The property was never used by the corporation for business purposes and it was never intended that it should be. Legal title to the property was later transferred back to Mrs. Dean on September 30, 1947.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b909-6\">The $15,077.63, which was not deducted by plaintiff in computing its income subject to either the normal tax or the undistributed profits tax for the taxable year 1936, is made up of the following:</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b909-7\">Actual expenditures</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b909-8\">Insurance $ 4,594.20</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b909-9\">Redecorating interior first floor, halls, stairs and entrance 3,784.50</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b909-10\">Miscellaneous repairs :and materials 462.05</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b909-11\">Painting exterior of buildings and bridges . 1,530.30</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b909-12\">Subtotal $10,371.05</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b909-13\">Estimated allowance for depreciation 4,706.58</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b909-14\">Total $15,077.63</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b909-15\">The taxpayer was not required to make any of the foregoing expenditures but did so at the request of its two stockholders.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b909-16\">7. Plaintiff\u2019s paid in capital at the time of its organization in 1924 was $962,924.19. Plaintiff\u2019s operations during the years 1925, 1926, 1927 and 1928 were profitable. During such years it declared and paid stock dividends, and recorded such transactions on its books of account by transfers from its surplus account to its capital account of the following amounts:</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b909-17\">Year 1925 $150,000</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"Azk\">Year 1926 402,500</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"atc-dedup-0\">Year 1927 ' 679,600</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"ADF\">Year 1928 996,000</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"Agb\">$2,228,100</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b909-18\">8. Plaintiff sustained substantial losses in the years 1933 and 1934. On December 31,. 1935, its accumulated earnings and profits amounted to $501,467.93 if the stock dividends referred to in the preceding paragraph are held not to have reduced its earnings and profits; but if such stock dividends are effective to reduce earnings and profits, it had no accumulated earnings and profits but instead a deficit in the sum of $1,726,632.07.</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b909-19\">9. The balance sheet which appears on plaintiff\u2019s income tax return as of December 31, 1935, was obtained from the plaintiff\u2019s books and is based solely on cost and not market value and is not adjusted by any corrections made by the Commissioner. Plaintiff\u2019s net profits for its taxable year 1935 were $138,880.65. Against this income the Commissioner assessed personal holding company surtax under \u00a7 351 of the Revenue Act of 1934, 26 U.S.C.A. Int. Rev. Acts, page 757, in the sum of $19,207.60, which plaintiff paid. No other federal income taxes were due. The amounts declared and paid by plaintiff as dividends during this year totaled $83,195.60.</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b909-20\">10. In determining plaintiff\u2019s net profits for 1936, plaintiff contends that the $133,-263.45 referred to in paragraph 5, supra, should be decreased by the following deductions : (a) The matters referred to in paragraph 6, supra, entitled \u201creal estate repairs,- insurance and depreciation;\u201d and (b) The federal tax liability of the plaintiff for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"862\">*862</page-number>1935, referred to in paragraph 9, supra, which was actually paid subsequent to 1935.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b910-4\">Thomas Cooch (of Morford, Bennethum, Marvel &amp; Cooch), of Wilmington, Del., and Laurence Graves, of New York City, for plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b910-5\">Theron Lamar Caudle, Asst.

S.C.A.Int.Rev.Acts, page 344, sufficient to entitle taxpayer to a refund under \u00a7 26(c) (3), as amended by Revenue Act 1942, \u00a7 501, 26 U.S.C.A.Int.Rev.Acts page 344, if it is otherwise entitled to it under \u00a7 26(c) (3) ? (2) Is the taxpayer in any event entitled to a credit under \u00a7 26(c) (3) of the Revenue Act of 1936 ? (3) If the taxpayer is entitled to relief under \u00a7 26(c) (3), whether it may receive the benefit of certain payments not claimed as deductions when the 1936 income tax return was filed. These questions will be considered in order, but first a statement will be made more fully discussing the arguments and apposite statutes relating to the second issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-10\">As the stipulation on the facts shows, plaintiff, for the years 1925-28 made money, and during such years declared and paid stock dividends. It recorded such transactions on its books by transferring from its surplus account to its capital account a sum in excess of $2,000,000. Plaintiff sustained substantial losses in the years 1933-34. On the critical date, December 31, 1935, the accumulated earnings and profits amounted to $501,467.93 if the stock dividends did not reduce its earnings and profits. But if such stock dividends are effective to reduce its earnings and profits, it had no accumulated earnings and profits but instead a deficit in the sum of $1,726,-632.07, and with the exception of minor deductions, plaintiff would be entitled to the refund here sought.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-13\">The purpose of the 1942 amendment, c. 619, 56 Stat. 798, \u00a7 5017 26 U.S.C.A.Int.Rev. Acts, page 344, was to relieve corporations which in 1936 were \u201ccaught in a trap\u201d. In short, many companies found their financial condition to be such that they were prohibited under the law of the state of their incorporation from paying dividends- and yet required under the terms of the Revenue Act of 1936, 49 Stat. 1648, \u00a7\u00a7 14, 26, 27, 26 U.S.C.A.Int.Rev.Acts, pages 823, 835, 837, to pay dividends or be taxable for their nonpayment. Plaintiff argues that under \u00a7 14 of the Delaware Corporation Law, Revised Code of Delaware 1915, \u00a7 1928, c. 65, \u00a7 14; Laws of Delaware 1925, Vol. 35, c. 85, \u00a7 8, its earnings for the years 1925-28 were duly transferred to its capital account and became a part of plaintiff\u2019s capital and were not available for distribution as earnings and profits in 1936, and that under \u00a7 34 of the Delaware Corporation Law, Revised Code of Delaware 1935, \u00a7 2066, c. 65, \u00a7 34; Laws of Delaware 1929, Vol. 36, c. 135, \u00a7 16, plaintiff could pay dividends in 1936 on its stock only out of (a) its net assets in excess of its capital, or (b) if there be no excess, out of its net profits for the year 1936 plus any net profits for the year 1935 that were not distributed by plaintiff in 1935. Since the facts show that plaintiff\u2019s capital exceeded its assets in 1936, plaintiff could pay dividends in 1936 only out of its net profits for that year plus any remaining undistributed profits for the year 1935.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-14\">I think it is unnecessary to quote the sections of the Delaware Corporation Law already referred to because not only has plaintiff correctly interpreted them but de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"863\">*863</page-number>fendant does not dispute the interpretation. Defendant, while not disputing plaintiff\u2019s interpretation of those sections of the Delaware Corporation Law, argues, however, that it could have reversed its practice of the years 1925-28 and in 1936 reduced its capital under \u00a7 28 of the Delaware Corporation Law, Revised Code of Delaware 1935, \u00a7 2060, c. 65, \u00a7 28;' Laws of Delaware 1929, Vol. 36, c. 135, \u00a7 15; and since it had this right \u2014 a right which does not require approval of the state \u2014 and did not exercise it, it was not \u201ccaught in a trap\u201d and is not entitled to the relief provisions of \u00a7 501 of the Revenue Act of 1942.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-5\">I think the form of the claim for refund is sufficient to entitle plaintiff to relief. It is true that in terms the credit or refund was claimed under an erroneous section, i. e., that the claim for refund is based on \u00a7 26(f) of the Revenue Act of 1936, as added by \u00a7 501(a) (3) of the Revenue Act of 1942,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> whereas it should have been filed under \u00a7 26(c) (3) of the same Act.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> It is further true that under regulations of the Treasury Department, which it is authorized to make, the claim for refund must fairly apprise a Commissioner of the grounds and circumstances surrounding the claim for refund. I am not unmindful that the Court in Angelus Milling Co. v. Commissioner, 325 U.S. 293, 299, 65 S.Ct. 1162, 1165, 89 L.Ed. 1619, in connection with this problem, said: \u201c * * * but it is not enough that somewhere under the Commissioner\u2019s roof is the information which might enable him to pass on a claim for refund.\u201d I think, however, it is possible to agree with the Court\u2019s statement and still think the form of the claim for refund in the case at bar is sufficient. Here, the claim is made for relief under the provisions of \u00a7 501 of the Revenue Act of 1942; all the facts are available in the refund claim. That one section of the Act was mentioned rather than another seems unimportant if the basic issue is predicated on the conclusion that the refund should be allowed. The additional burden \u2014 if such there was \u2014 imposed on the Commissioner seems, at most, a very trivial one.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-9\">Plaintiff, under authority of Ogilvie Hardware Co. v. United States, 330 U.S. 709, 67 S.Ct. 997, 91 L.Ed. 1192, and United States v. Byron Sash and Door Co., 6 Cir., 150 F.2d 44, is entitled to relief unless precluded by its failure to exercise its rights to reduce capital under \u00a7 28 of the Delaware Corporation Law. In the last case above, which involved a Kentucky corporation, the factual situation was comparable to that here. In that case, as here, there would have been no deficit in earnings and profits on December 31, 1935, if plaintiff had not distributed stock dividends in prior years. In that case, as here, there were subsequent operating losses. Nevertheless, the Court held that the corporation was entitled to tax relief. Under the Ken<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"864\">*864</page-number>tucky law, however, unlike the Delaware law, there was nothing the corporation could have done to have avoided the tax in 1936. There was no provision comparable to \u00a7 28 of the Delaware Corporation Law. The issue here, then, is a narrow one, viz., does the existence of \u00a7 28 of the Delaware Corporation, Law preclude the plaintiff from his refund? I conclude not.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-4\">The arguments that, plaintiff can not \u25a0claim the refund unless .it reduced its capital under \u00a7 28 of the Delaware Corporation Law do not persuade me. I find nothing in: the Revenue Act of 1942 enforcing the \u25a0conclusion that the Court must consider not only the actual situation but also the situation as it might have been. I think the Revenue Act of 1942 dealt only with an actual situation and did not make it obligatory on corporations to change their capital structures in order to qualify under the Act. Alteration of capital structure is an act of independent legal significance. There may be many reasons ex tax considerations why a company would not wish to change its capital structure. Since the remedial Act dealt with the actual condition and since the capital of plaintiff company was not, in fact, reduced, it is entitled to a refund. United States v. Byron Sash and Door Co., 6 Cir., 150 F.2d 44.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-5\">There were items of minor deductions. These are certain items of depreciation and expense of the property of plaintiff not claimed as deductions when the return was filed in 1936. The argument of the defendant is that since they were not claimed as deductions at the time the return was filed, they are not deductible now. The plaintiff simply takes the opposite position. I think clearly these items may be considered in connection with the relief provisions of the Revenue Act of 1942. It would be pure fiction to say that such deductions were earnings and available as dividends. Whether the deductions were claimed is irrelevant. The plain fact is that the money has been spent and obviously is not available for any purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-6\">In accordance with the last paragraph \u2022of the stipulation, I am simply making a finding in favor of. plaintiff, and the .amounts may be arrived at when the order is settled.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b910-11\">. The complaint claims $30,385.87 with interest.
