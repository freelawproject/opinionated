J.</author>\n<p id=\"A4bo\">Plaintiffs Manuela and Juan Zermeno appeal from the judgment entered for defendants in their unfair competition action after the trial court found that the pretrial settlement of their damage claims meant they no longer had standing to sue under the new standing requirements of Proposition 64. We hold that the changed standing rule was not intended to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"776\">*776</page-number>apply to cases pending when it took effect where a plaintiff had suffered actual injury as required by the new law, but settled that portion of its action before Proposition 64 took effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-4\">FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b692-5\">Manuela and Juan Zermeno joined a health care discount program offered by Care Entr\u00e9e in December 2001.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> For a monthly fee of $54.95, deducted automatically from the Zermenos\u2019 bank account, Care Entr\u00e9e offered access to groups of health care providers who would charge discount rates. When three dentists identified on Care Entr\u00e9e\u2019s list of providers said they did not participate in the program and would not offer discounts, the Zermenos tried to cancel their membership in the program. Care Entr\u00e9e did not terminate their membership for another year, however, and continued to withdraw the monthly fee from the Zermenos\u2019 account. When Care Entr\u00e9e finally ended the Zermenos\u2019 contract, it refunded less than $200 of the $714.35 it had taken from them.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-6\">In August 2003, the Zermenos sued Care Entr\u00e9e in the Los Angeles Superior Court, alleging that Care Entr\u00e9e had violated the law governing discount buying services. (Civ. Code, \u00a7 1812.100 et seq.) They also alleged that Care Entr\u00e9e\u2019s violation of that law amounted to unfair competition, in violation of Business and Professions Code section 17200. Care Entr\u00e9e removed the action to federal court, where the Zermenos filed a first amended complaint that added a claim for violation of Health and Safety Code section 445, which bars the operation of for-profit health care referral services.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The unfair competition claim was amended to include a violation of that provision, along with the discount buying service claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-7\">On October 4, 2004, Care Entree and the Zermenos reached a partial settlement. The parties stipulated to remand the action to state court solely to litigate the Zermenos\u2019 injunctive relief claims under Health and Safety Code <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"777\">*777</page-number>section 445 and the unfair competition laws. Care Entree would pay the Zermenos $25,000 as full compensation for damages of any kind, including their restitution claims for unfair competition and their damage claims under the discount buying service laws. The Zermenos also agreed to forego any unfair competition restitution claims on behalf of the general public. The settlement was subject to approval by the federal district court, and on October 7, 2004, that court approved the agreement and remanded the action to the Los Angeles Superior Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-5\">After remand, the state court denied the Zermenos\u2019 motion for summary adjudication of their Health and Safety Code section 445 claim because that statute allowed only the Attorney General to sue, and did not confer a private right of action.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b693-6\">On November 2, 2004, the voters approved Proposition 64, which amended the unfair competition law to state that a person has standing to sue for unfair competition only if he \u201chas suffered injury in fact and has lost money or property as a result of [such] unfair competition.\u201d (See Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 17203, 17204, as amended by Prop. 64, \u00a7\u00a7 2, 3.) Before then, anyone acting for the general public had standing to sue for relief from unfair competition even if he had not suffered any injury. (Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, former \u00a7\u00a7 17203, 17204; <em>Stop Youth Addiction, Inc. v. Lucky Stores, Inc. </em>(1998) 17 Cal.4th 553, 561 [71 Cal.Rptr.2d 731, 950 P.2d 1086].)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The initiative\u2019s findings and declarations of purpose stated that it was designed in part to stop lawyers from filing unfair competition actions if they have \u201c \u2018no client who has been injured in fact under the standing requirements of the United States Constitution.\u2019 \u201d (Historical and Statutory Notes, 4D West\u2019s Ann. Bus. &amp; Prof. Code (2008 ed.) foll. \u00a7 17203, p. 409.) The new law took effect the day after its passage. In July 2006, our Supreme Court decided <em>Californians for Disability Rights v. Mervyn\u2019s, LLC </em>(2006) 39 Cal.4th 223 [46 Cal.Rptr.3d 57, 138 P.3d 207] <em>(Mervyn\u2019s), </em>which held that Proposition 64\u2019s new standing requirement applied to all pending unfair competition actions, including those filed before the changed law took effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-7\">The Zermenos\u2019 case went to trial in June 2007 on the theory that they could seek to enjoin Care Entr\u00e9e\u2019s alleged violation of Health and Safety Code section 445 under the unfair competition law. (See <em>Stop Youth Addiction, Inc. v. Lucky Stores, Inc., supra, </em>17 Cal.4th at pp. 562-563 [plaintiffs can <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"778\">*778</page-number>bring unfair competition action for violation of any statute, even if that statute does not confer a private right of action].) The trial court found that they lacked standing to pursue their unfair competition claim because, under <em>Mervyn\u2019s, supra, </em>39 Cal.4th 223, the new standing requirements applied to their action, and because their 2004 settlement and release of all damage claims meant they no longer had any injury in fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-4\">The Zermenos contend the trial court erred when it ruled on their earlier summary adjudication motion that they lacked standing to sue under Health and Safety Code section 445, and when it found at trial that the settlement of their damage claims eliminated their standing to sue for unfair competition.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b694-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b694-6\">1. <em>The New Standing Requirement Does Not Apply to This Unique Factual Situation</em></p>\n<p id=\"b694-7\">It is undisputed that up to the time of the settlement, the Zermenos had a claim for actual injury that would have conferred standing under Proposition 64. They contend those injuries continued to give them standing even after the settlement and the decision in <em>Mervyn\u2019s. </em>Care Entr\u00e9e contends that <em>Mervyn\u2019s </em>\u201cforeclosed\u201d the standing issue against the Zermenos. We conclude that Proposition 64, as construed by <em>Mervyn\u2019s, </em>does not impose the new standing requirement on these peculiar facts.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b694-8\">The plaintiff in <em>Mervyn\u2019s </em>was a disability rights organization that sued for unfair competition because it alleged the layout of the defendant\u2019s department stores interfered with access by persons who used wheelchairs, scooters, crutches, and other mobility assistance devices. At no time had the plaintiff <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"779\">*779</page-number>itself suffered any actual injury, but because the plaintiff sued before Proposition 64 was passed, it had standing at the time it brought the action. <em>Mervyn\u2019s </em>won at trial and the plaintiff appealed. After Proposition 64 took effect, <em>Mervyn\u2019s </em>moved to dismiss the appeal because the plaintiff had suffered no injury and therefore lacked standing under the new law. The Court of Appeal denied the motion to dismiss, and the Supreme Court reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-5\">The parties framed the issue as whether the new law was intended to apply retroactively or prospectively. The Supreme Court noted the general rule that statutes are presumed to operate prospectively in the absence of a clearly expressed contrary intent. <em>(Mervyn\u2019s, supra, </em>39 Cal.4th at pp. 230-231.) The newly enacted statutory language was silent on the topic, but there was language in the preamble that could be so construed. Rather than rely on that ambiguous language, the court relied on the traditional rules of statutory construction and determined that applying the new standing requirement to pending unfair competition cases resulted in a prospective application of Proposition 64. (39 Cal.4th at pp. 230-231.)</p>\n<p id=\"b695-6\">The <em>Mervyn\u2019s </em>court reached that conclusion by focusing on the effects of new legislation, not its substantive or procedural labels. If a new law changes the legal consequences of past conduct by imposing new or different liabilities for that conduct, or if it substantially affects existing rights and obligations, then its \u201c \u2018application to a trial of preenactment conduct is forbidden, absent an express legislative intent to permit such retroactive application.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Mervyn\u2019s, supra, </em>39 Cal.4th at pp. 230-231.) A statute that establishes rules for the conduct of pending litigation without changing the legal consequences of past conduct is not retroactive, even if it draws upon facts that existed before the new law took effect. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b695-7\">Applying the new standing requirement in that case did not make the provision retroactive because it did not change the legal consequences of past conduct by imposing new or different liabilities based on that conduct. It also did not change the substantive rules governing improper business conduct and it still permitted restitution of profits obtained in violation of the unfair competition law. <em>(Mervyn\u2019s, supra, </em>39 Cal.4th at pp. 232-233.) Instead, all Proposition 64 did was withdraw standing from uninjured persons to sue on behalf of others who were injured. Standing must exist throughout the life of an action. Because challenges to standing are jurisdictional in nature and may be raised at any time, the new requirement was not retroactive. (39 Cal.4th at p. 233.)</p>\n<p id=\"b696-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"780\">*780</page-number>The <em>Mervyn\u2019s </em>court held that Proposition 64 does not \u201c \u2018significantly impair the settled rights and expectations of the parties to continue prosecution of their actions.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Mervyn\u2019s, supra, </em>39 Cal.4th at p. 233.) The only rights and expectations at issue were those of noninjured plaintiffs to volunteer as private attorneys general and recover their attorney\u2019s fees for obtaining restitution for others. The presumption of prospective operation should not be applied to protect so abstract an interest. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b696-5\">In short, the <em>Mervyn\u2019s </em>court held that applying the new standing requirement to a plaintiff who was never injured did not upset any meaningful, settled rights. Where such rights were impaired, however, application of the new standing requirement was forbidden unless the statute expressly provided for it. <em>(Mervyn\u2019s, supra, </em>39 Cal.4th at pp. 230-231.)  The Zermenos did suffer actual injury, but settled that portion of their claim before Proposition 64 was passed, partly in exchange for the right to pursue their injunctive relief claim in state court. Unlike applying Proposition 64 to the <em>Mervyn\u2019s </em>plaintiff, applying Proposition 64 to the Zermenos would \u201c \u2018significantly impair [their] settled rights and expectations ....\u2019\u201d (39 Cal.4th at p. 233.)<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Nothing in the statute or in the <em>Mervyn\u2019s </em>holding allows for application of Proposition 64\u2019s new standing requirement in such a case.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b696-8\">2., 3.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b697-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"781\">*781</page-number>DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b697-5\">The judgment is reversed and the matter is remanded to the superior court for further proceedings.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Appellants shall recover their appellate costs.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b697-6\">Flier, 1, and Mohr, J.,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b692-8\"> Care Entr\u00e9e is operated by defendants Precis, Inc., and The Capella Group, Inc., which do business under that name.

Because that order is not appealable until there is a final judgment, the issue is premature. <em>(Federal Deposit Ins. Corp. </em>v. <em>Dintino </em>(2008) 167 Cal.App.4th 333, 342-343 [84 Cal.Rptr.3d 38].)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b694-10\"> The purpose of Proposition 64 was to weed out unmeritorious claims by uninjured plaintiffs. Therefore, it seems to us that allowing unfair competition plaintiffs with actual injuries to settle their damage claims and proceed to trial on the merits of injunctive relief would not thwart that purpose, and would streamline the trial of such actions. For purposes of our discussion, however, we assume, but do not hold, that an unfair competition plaintiff with actual injury who settles his injury claims is no longer suffering an injury in fact as required by section 17204.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b696-9\"> It would also grant Care Entr\u00e9e a windfall by effectively settling the entire action even though it too bargained for continuation of the Zermenos\u2019 injunctive relief claim. We presume a complete settlement would have come at a higher price.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b696-10\"> Although not raised as an issue by the parties, application of Proposition 64, which was enacted after the Zermenos\u2019 settlement, might also be an unconstitutional impairment of the Zermenos\u2019 contract rights under that settlement. (U.S. Const., art. I, \u00a7 10, cl. 1; Cal. Const., art. I, \u00a7 9; <em>In re Marriage of Guthrie </em>(1987) 191 Cal.App.3d 654, 660-663 [236 Cal.Rptr. 583] [applying newly enacted statute to permit retroactive modification of marital settlement agreement that awarded former wife custody of the community property house as a form of child support would be unconstitutional].) We merely note this potential issue however, and it does not factor into our analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-11\">We also want to make clear that our holding is limited to the unique facts of this case. In reaching this result, we have found an example in <em>Branick </em>v. <em>Downey Savings &amp; Loan Assn. </em>(2006) 39 Cal.4th 235 [46 Cal.Rptr.3d 66, 138 P.3d 214], which was the companion case to <em>Mervyn\u2019s. </em>In that case, the court held that the uninjured plaintiffs who lost standing after Proposition 64 took effect could seek leave to amend their complaint to substitute in their stead a plaintiff who sustained actual injury. <em>(Branick, </em>at pp. 243-244.) Therefore, our Supreme Court has at least suggested its willingness to adopt a flexible approach when warranted in cases where standing was lost due to the passage of Proposition 64.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-12\">Finally, we express no opinion on the merits of the Zermenos\u2019 claim for injunctive relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-13\">*See footnote, <em>ante, </em>page 773.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b697-7\"> The Zermenos point out that recent Supreme Court decisions have construed other portions of Proposition 64 to require unfair competition plaintiffs to proceed under the certification requirements for class actions. <em>(Amalgamated Transit Union, Local 1756, AFL-CIO </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(2009) 46 Cal.4th 993 [95 Cal.Rptr.3d 605, 209 P.3d 937]; <em>Arias v. Superior Court </em>(2009) 46 Cal.4th 969 [95 Cal.Rptr.3d 588, 209 P.3d 923].) The Zermenos ask us to certify this as a class action, but that is an issue for the trial court in the first instance.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b697-8\"> We allowed three groups\u2014Maternal and Child Health Access, California Pan-Ethnic Health Network, and Koreatown Immigrant Workers Alliance\u2014to appear as amicus curiae and file an amicus curiae brief. That brief was limited to two issues: whether plans such as those offered by Care Entr\u00e9e are truly necessary because consumers can negotiate for their own discounts; and whether the Department of Managed Health Care is allowed to, or capable of, effectively regulating businesses that violate Health and Safety Code section 445. The trial court did not reach those issues, and they too are best resolved there. Accordingly, we disregard the arguments raised in the amicus curiae brief, along with the supporting exhibits. We therefore deny as moot Care Entr\u00e9e\u2019s motion to strike four exhibits from the amicus curiae brief, consisting mostly of news accounts, on the grounds they are hearsay and were not part of the trial record.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b697-9\">Judge of the Los Angeles Superior Court, assigned by the Chief Justice pursuant to article VI, section 6 of the California Constitution.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
