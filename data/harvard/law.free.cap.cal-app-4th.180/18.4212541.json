Under the peculiar risk doctrine, one may be held vicari<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>ously liable if one hires an independent contractor to do work that is likely to create a peculiar risk of harm to others unless special precautions are taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-4\">The alleged peculiar risk in the present case arose out of a trucker-pedestrian accident at the lone entrance of a construction site. There is evidence that this intersection entrance required the trucker to make a U-tum (while driving westbound in eastbound lanes), encroach on at least two pedestrian crosswalks, jump a curb, and drive across a sidewalk.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-5\">We reverse a summary judgment and a stipulated judgment that concluded, as a matter of law, that the trucker\u2019s insurers did not owe a duty to defend the developer/general contractor/grading contractor under any vicarious liability theory.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-6\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b47-7\">In this action, plaintiff and appellant American States Insurance Company (American) seeks a defense on behalf of its insureds\u2014in the underlying pedestrian/tmcker lawsuit\u2014from defendant and respondent insurers, Progressive Casualty Insurance Company (Progressive) and Wilshire Insurance Company (Wilshire). American also seeks a declaration that Progressive provide the primary coverage for the lawsuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-8\">The trucker-pedestrian collision occurred as follows. On July 15, 2005, Victor Meza, a self-employed trucker, was driving a tractor-trailer at the only entrance to a construction site in San Diego when the rear portion of his trailer ran over a pedestrian, Yevdokia Bristman (Bristman). As a result, both of Bristman\u2019s legs had to be amputated. Meza was the sole owner and operator of the tractor (truck) and was insured by Progressive. Western Trucking LLC (Western) was the sole owner of the trailer and was insured by Wilshire.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-9\">At the time of the accident, Meza was hauling dirt under an agreement with Western. Western in turn was operating under an oral agreement with Vinci Pacific Corporation (Vinci), the grading contractor on the construction project (the Project). The Project\u2019s general contractor was Garden Communities (Garden). The Project\u2019s developer was TRII LLC (TRII). Vinci was a named insured under a commercial auto policy issued by American; Garden and TRII were additional insureds under that policy. Vinci, Garden and TRII (collectively, the Vinci parties) tendered their defense of the pedestrian Bristman\u2019s action (Bristman Lawsuit) to American. American accepted the tender under a reservation of rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>The complaint in the Bristman Lawsuit, which was filed in San Diego Superior Court, alleged in part a cause of action for motor vehicle negligence against the Vinci parties, claiming that they employed Meza and that Meza and Western were their agents. The Bristman Lawsuit also alleged that the Vinci parties were liable for failing to take necessary safety precautions at the Project\u2019s intersection entrance. Meza and Western, in turn, cross-complained against each other and the Vinci parties, alleging that the Vinci parties were vicariously liable.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-4\">American tendered the defense of the Vinci parties in the Bristman Lawsuit to Progressive and Wilshire. In denying this tender, Progressive and Wilshire noted that the Vinci parties were not named or additional insureds under the Progressive or Wilshire policies, and were not using the truck involved in the Bristman accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-5\">In the Bristman Lawsuit, the Vinci parties individually moved for summary judgment. As relevant here, those parties disputed Bristman\u2019s claim that they were vicariously liable for Meza\u2019s operation of his truck. In denying these summary judgment motions, the Bristman trial court found in part that there were triable issues of material fact concerning (1) whether Garden retained control over Meza\u2019s operation of his truck, (2) whether the peculiar risk doctrine applied, and (3) whether Vinci was a substantial factor in causing Bristman\u2019s injuries.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b48-6\">That brings us to the present action, which American filed in Sacramento Superior Court (hereafter Defense Lawsuit). Through this action, American seeks (1) declaratory relief concerning Progressive\u2019s and Wilshire\u2019s duty to defend the Vinci parties in the Bristman Lawsuit, and (2) reimbursement of sums American paid in defending the Bristman Lawsuit.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b48-7\">In the Defense Lawsuit, American moved for summary adjudication and Wilshire moved for summary judgment/adjudication. Both motions raised the dispositive issue of whether Progressive and Wilshire had a duty to defend the Vinci parties in the Bristman Lawsuit. After taking judicial notice of the Bristman Lawsuit\u2014in the sense that Progressive and Wilshire had notice of plaintiff Bristman\u2019s contentions and supporting facts\u2014the trial court in this Defense Lawsuit found, as a matter of law, that Progressive and Wilshire did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>not have any duty to defend the Vinci parties in the Bristman Lawsuit. The defense trial court found that there was no agency relationship between Meza/Westem and the Vinci parties, and that the peculiar risk doctrine did not apply. A judgment for Wilshire, and a stipulated judgment for Progressive, followed. This appeal from American then ensued.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b49-5\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b49-6\">A. <em>The Issue</em></p>\n<p id=\"b49-7\">The dispositive issue is whether there is a triable issue of material fact that American\u2019s insureds, the Vinci parties, were potentially vicariously liable in the Bristman Lawsuit under the theory of retained control establishing agency or under the doctrine of peculiar risk. We answer \u201cno\u201d as to the retained control theory, but \u201cyes\u201d as to the peculiar risk doctrine. Accordingly, as we shall explain, Progressive and Wilshire owed the Vinci parties\u2014pursuant to this potential vicarious liability under the peculiar risk doctrine\u2014a duty to defend them in the Bristman Lawsuit, absent additional evidence regarding this duty.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-8\">B. <em>Standard of Review</em></p>\n<p id=\"b49-9\"><em>A </em>summary judgment is to be upheld if all the evidentiary papers submitted\u2014which we <em>review </em>independently\u2014show that there is no triable issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. We do not resolve factual issues but ascertain whether there are any to resolve. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 437c, subd. (c); <em>Colores v. Board of Trustees </em>(2003) 105 Cal.App.4th 1293, 1305 [130 Cal.Rptr.2d 347] <em>(Colores); Flait </em>v. <em>North American Watch Corp. </em>(1992) 3 Cal.App.4th 467, 474-475 [4 Cal.Rptr.2d 522].)</p>\n<p id=\"b49-10\">Because a summary judgment denies the losing party its day in court, we liberally construe the evidence in support of that party and resolve doubts concerning the evidence in that party\u2019s favor. <em>(Wiener v. Southcoast Childcare Centers, Inc. </em>(2004) 32 Cal.4th 1138, 1142 [12 Cal.Rptr.3d 615, 88 P.3d 517]; <em>Colores, supra, </em>105 Cal.App.4th at p. 1305.)</p>\n<p id=\"b49-11\">C. <em>Legal Principles Governing Duty to Defend and Burden of Proof in Summary Judgment/Declaratory Relief Context</em></p>\n<p id=\"b49-12\">A liability insurer must defend its insured whenever it ascertains facts that give rise to the <em>potential </em>of liability under the policy. <em>(Montrose Chemical </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number><em>Corp. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1993) 6 Cal.4th 287, 295 [24 Cal.Rptr.2d 467, 861 P.2d 1153] <em>(Montrose); Gray v.

Mercury Casualty Co. </em>(1993) 18 Cal.App.4th 1784, 1789-1790 [23 Cal.Rptr.2d 73].)</p>\n<p id=\"b50-4\">\u201cThe insurer\u2019s duty to defend the \u2018insured\u2019 includes both the named insured(s) and anyone else included in the policy\u2019s definition of \u2018insured.\u2019 \u201d (Croskey et al., Cal. Practice Guide: Insurance Litigation (The Rutter Group 2009) \u00b6 7:514.5, p. 7B-7 (rev. # 1, 2009) (hereafter Croskey); see also <em>Maryland Casualty Co. v. Nationwide Ins. Co. </em>(1998) 65 Cal.App.4th 21, 29-30 [76 Cal.Rptr.2d 113].)</p>\n<p id=\"b50-5\">In determining its duty to defend, the insurer must consider facts from any source\u2014the complaint, the insured, and other sources. <em>(Montrose, supra, </em>6 Cal.4th at pp. 298-299; <em>Gray, supra, </em>65 Cal.2d at p. 276; Croskey, <em>supra, </em>\u00b6 7:581, p. 7B-27 (rev. # 1, 2009).) An insurer does not have a continuing duty to investigate the potential for coverage if it has made an informed decision on coverage at the time of tender. <em>(Gunderson v. Fire Ins. Exchange </em>(1995) 37 Cal.App.4th 1106, 1114 [44 Cal.Rptr.2d 272].) However, where the information available at the time of tender shows no coverage, but information available later shows otherwise, a duty to defend may then arise. (See <em>Marie Y. v. General Star Indemnity Co. </em>(2003) 110 Cal.App.4th 928, 957 [2 Cal.Rptr.3d 135]; Croskey, <em>supra, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 7:519, 7:519.5, p. 7B-9 (rev. # 1, 2009).)</p>\n<p id=\"b50-6\">In an action in which some claims are potentially covered and others are not, the insurer must defend the entire action, including those claims for which there is no potential coverage under the policy\u2014even if those claims predominate. It is enough that a single claim is potentially covered by the policy; the insurer owes a duty to defend even if all other claims against the insured are clearly not covered. This duty to defend the entire \u201cmixed\u201d action is justified, not contractually, but \u201cprophylactically, as an obligation imposed by law in support of the [insurance] policy.\u201d <em>(Buss v. Superior Court </em>(1997) 16 Cal.4th 35, 48-49 [65 Cal.Rptr.2d 366, 939 P.2d 766] <em>(Buss), </em>fn. omitted; see <em>Horace Mann Ins. Co. v. Barbara B. </em>(1993) 4 Cal.4th 1076, 1081, 1084 [17 Cal.Rptr.2d 210, 846 P.2d 792]; <em>Cassady v. Morgan, Lewis &amp; Bockius LLP </em>(2006) 145 Cal.App.4th 220, 235 [51 Cal.Rptr.3d 527]; Croskey, <em>supra, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 7:629-7:630.1, p. 7B-41 (rev. # 1, 2009).) This duty to defend an entire action continues \u201cuntil the insurer produces undeniable evidence supporting an allocation of a specific portion of the defense costs to a noncovered claim.\u201d <em>(Horace Mann, supra, 4 </em>Cal.4th at p. 1081; see also <em>id. </em>at p. 1084.) The defending insurer may have a right to be reimbursed for defense costs allocable solely to claims for which there was no potential coverage under the policy. <em>(Buss, supra, </em>16 Cal.4th at pp. 50-51.)</p>\n<p id=\"b51-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>In resolving the question of whether a duty to defend exists\u2014 tendered in the context of a summary adjudication/ summary judgment motion in a declaratory relief action\u2014the insurer has a higher burden than the insured. \u201c[T]he insured need only show that the underlying claim <em>may </em>fall within policy coverage; the insurer must prove it cannot\u201d; the insurer, in other words, must present undisputed facts that eliminate any possibility of coverage.

The Theory of Retained Control Establishing Agency<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b52-16\">III. The Peculiar Risk Doctrine</p>\n<p id=\"b52-17\">Generally, an \u201cemployer\u201d (i.e., hirer) of an independent contractor is not liable for the negligence of the contractor or its employees. The exceptions to this rule, however, are numerous. <em>(Castro v. State of California </em>(1981) 114 Cal.App.3d 503, 509-510 [170 Cal.Rptr. 734] <em>(Castro).) </em>One of these exceptions is the peculiar risk doctrine as expressed in Restatement Second of Torts, sections 413 and 416. <em>(Castro, </em>at p. 510; <em>Toland </em>v. <em>Sunland Housing </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number><em>Group, Inc. </em>(1998) 18 Cal.4th 253, 256 [74 Cal.Rptr.2d 878, 955 P.2d 504] <em>(Toland); Griesel v. Dart Industries, Inc. </em>(1979) 23 Cal.3d 578, 585 [153 Cal.Rptr. 213, 591 P.2d 503] <em>(Griesel), </em>overruled on other grounds in <em>Privette v. Superior Court </em>(1993) 5 Cal.4th 689, 696 [21 Cal.Rptr.2d 72, 854 P.2d 721] <em>(Privette))</em></p>\n<p id=\"b53-4\">Restatement Second of Torts, section 413 provides: \u201cOne who employs an independent contractor to do work which the employer should recognize as likely to create, during its progress, a peculiar unreasonable risk of physical harm to others unless special precautions are taken, is subject to liability for physical harm caused to them by the absence of such precautions <em>if the employer </em>[f] (a) <em>fails </em>to provide in the contract that the contractor shall take such precautions, <em>or </em>[f] (b) <em>fails </em>to exercise reasonable care to provide in some other manner for the taking of such precautions.\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b53-5\">Restatement Second of Torts, section 416 states: \u201cOne who employs an independent contractor to do work which the employer should recognize as likely to create during its progress a peculiar risk of physical harm to others unless special precautions are taken, is subject to liability for physical harm caused to them <em>by the failure of the contractor to exercise </em>reasonable care to take such precautions, even though the employer has provided for such precautions in the contract or otherwise.\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b53-6\">Given this italicized difference in language between Restatement Second of Torts, sections 413 and 416, as well as the sections\u2019 respective placements in the restatement\u2019s direct and vicarious liability sectors, older decisions have characterized section 413 as \u201cdirect\u201d liability for an \u201cemployer\u201d and section 416 as \u201cvicarious\u201d liability. <em>(Toland, supra, </em>18 Cal.4th at pp. 259-260; see <em>Griesel, supra, 23 </em>Cal.3d at pp. 585-586; <em>Castro, supra, </em>114 Cal.App.3d at p. 510; see also Rest.2d Torts, topic 2, introductory note to \u00a7 416, p. 394.)</p>\n<p id=\"b53-7\">More recent decisions from our state Supreme Court, however, have characterized the nature of liability set forth in both sections 413 and 416 of the Restatement Second of Torts as essentially \u201cvicarious\u201d liability. <em>(Toland, supra, </em>18 Cal.4th at pp. 261-262, 265-266; <em>Privette, supra, </em>5 Cal.4th at p. 695 &amp; fn. 2.) As <em>Toland </em>explained: \u201c[U]nder both sections 413 and 416, the hiring person\u2019s liability is cast in the form of the hiring person\u2019s breach of a duty to see to it that special precautions are taken to prevent injuries to others; in that sense, the liability is \u2018direct.\u2019 Yet, peculiar risk liability is not a traditional theory of direct liability for the risks created by one\u2019s own conduct: Liability under both sections is in essence \u2018vicarious\u2019 or \u2018derivative\u2019 in the sense that it derives from the \u2018act or omission\u2019 of the hired contractor, because it is the hired contractor who has caused the injury by failing to use <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>reasonable care in performing the work. We made this point in <em>Privette, supra, </em>5 Cal.4th at page 695, in footnote 2: \u2018The conclusion that peculiar risk is a form of vicarious liability is unaffected by the characterization of the doctrine as \u201cdirect\u201d liability in situations when the person hiring an independent contractor \u201cfails to provide in the contract that the contractor shall take [special] precautions.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>(Toland, supra, </em>18 Cal.4th at p. 265.)</p>\n<p id=\"b54-4\">The characterization of both section 413 and section 416 of the Restatement Second of Torts as vicarious liability follows because the \u201cprincipal distinction in application of sections 413 and 416 .. . concerns the \u2018employer\u2019 and [the] independent contractor [he has hired] and not the liability of the \u2018employer\u2019 to others. Where there is a special [peculiar] risk of physical harm, the \u2018employer\u2019 is liable to third persons injured as a proximate result of the independent contractor\u2019s negligence <em>whether or not there is an agreement </em>requiring the independent contractor to take special precautions.\u201d <em>(Kelleher v. Empresa Hondurena de Vapores, S.A. </em>(1976) 57 Cal.App.3d 52, 61-62 [129 Cal.Rptr. 32], italics as added by quotation of <em>Kelleher </em>in <em>Toland, supra, </em>18 Cal.4th at p. 266.) \u201cThe existence of the contract [between the \u2018employer\u2019 and the independent contractor], while not affecting the rights of others, does, however, significantly affect the rights of the \u2018employer\u2019 and independent contractor by obligating the independent contractor to indemnify the \u2018employer\u2019 for loss occasioned by his liability to others.\u201d <em>(Kelleher, </em>at p. 62, citing Rest.2d Torts, \u00a7 413, com. e[, p. 386].) In short, \u201c[a] person held liable under the doctrine of peculiar risk is entitled to equitable indemnity from the independent contractor .... [Citations.] Thus, although peculiar risk is sometimes described as a \u2018nondelegable duty\u2019 rule . . . , it is in effect a form of vicarious liability.\u201d <em>(Privette, supra, </em>5 Cal.4th at p. 695, citations omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b54-5\">Consequently, in light of <em>Toland </em>and <em>Privette, </em>the peculiar risk doctrine set forth in sections 413 and 416 of the Restatement Second of Torts is essentially a doctrine of vicarious liability. And the \u201cdoctrine relates to \u2018special risks, peculiar to the work to be done, and arising out of its character, or out of the place where it is to be done, against which a reasonable man would recognize the necessity of taking special precautions. . . . \u201cPeculiar\u201d does not mean that the risk must be one which is abnormal to the type of work done, or that it must be an abnormally great risk. It has reference only to a special, recognizable danger arising out of the work itself.\u2019 (Rest.[2d Torts], \u00a7 413, com. b[, pp. 385-386].)\u201d <em>(Castro, supra, </em>114 Cal.App.3d at p. 510.)</p>\n<p id=\"b54-6\">That brings us to the issue of the applicability of the peculiar risk doctrine in the underlying Bristman accident. Again, by specifying the disputed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>material facts and the summary judgment evidence supporting them, the trial court in the Bristman Lawsuit concluded, as to TRII\u2019s<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> motion there for summary judgment/adjudication, that a triable issue of material fact existed as to whether the peculiar risk doctrine applied. The Bristman trial court found: \u201c[T]he manner in which . . . TRII allowed its subcontractors to use [the Project\u2019s lone] entrance required them to execute a [U]-tum (driving westbound in eastbound lanes), encroach on at least two pedestrian cross walks [sic], jump a curb, and drive across a sidewalk to access the [Project], all without assistance of . . . flagmen.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b55-4\">Based on the legal principles of peculiar risk set forth above and these disputed facts just noted, we conclude the doctrine of peculiar risk potentially applied to the Bristman accident. There is evidence from the Bristman Lawsuit, and judicially noticed in this Defense Lawsuit, showing that Meza/Westem\u2019s track-trailer access of the Project entrance involved a special risk, peculiar to the work to be done, that arose out of the place where it was to be done, and against which a reasonable man would recognize the necessity of taking special precautions. <em>(Castro, supra, </em>114 Cal.App.3d at p. 510.)</p>\n<p id=\"b55-5\">The Defense Lawsuit trial court erred in concluding as a matter of law that the Bristman accident involved simply an ordinary dump track accident (rather than a potential peculiar risk), similar to the ordinary accident in <em>A. Teichert &amp; Son, Inc. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1986) 179 Cal.App.3d 657 [225 Cal.Rptr. 10]. In <em>Teichert, </em>a bicyclist riding westbound along the shoulder of a road simply collided with a dump track turning left from the eastbound lane into the entrance of Teichert\u2019s property. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 660; see also <em>id. </em>at p. 661.) In contrast, here there was evidence showing that Meza/Westem\u2019s trailer (bottom-dump dirt hauler) collided with Bristman while accessing the Vinci parties\u2019 Project entrance, a lone entrance which required Meza/Westem \u201cto execute a [U]-tum (driving westbound in eastbound lanes), encroach on at least two pedestrian cross walks [sic], jump a curb, and drive across a sidewalk . . . , all without assistance of. . . flagmen.\u201d This evidence shows no ordinary collision.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-6\"><em>Teichert </em>is not the exemplar in this regard. <em>Castro </em>is. There, dump tracks had to proceed to a point north of the construction site, turn around at an intersection or driveway, and back down for a distance of a half block or more to a backhoe for loading. During this procedure, an injury accident occurred. <em>(Castro, supra, </em>114 Cal.App.3d at p. 512.) <em>Castro </em>found this evidence sufficient to support a jury verdict of vicarious liability under the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>peculiar risk doctrine of Restatement Second of Torts, section 416. (Castro, at p. 512; see also <em>id. </em>at pp. 509, 517.)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b56-4\">Drawing from what we have said, then, we can now conclude that the Vinci parties were potentially liable for the Bristman accident under the vicarious liability theory of the peculiar risk doctrine. And this conclusion leads to one more, this one dispositive: Progressive and Wilshire, as the respective insurers of Meza and Western, owed the Vinci parties a duty of defense triggered by this potential vicarious liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-5\">Progressive and Wilshire beg to differ on numerous grounds, none of which we find convincing.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-6\">Progressive\u2019s and Wilshire\u2019s basic opposition rests on two embellishments: that the Vinci parties based their tendered defense duty merely on boilerplate allegations of agency in the Bristman Lawsuit; and that the Vinci parties are complete strangers to the Progressive and Wilshire insurance policies.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-7\">Admittedly, in boilerplate fashion, the Bristman complaint alleged that Meza, Western and the Vinci parties were all principals and agents of one another. However, as we have seen, as the Bristman Lawsuit proceeded through summary judgment motions, triable evidence was presented that implicated one or more of the Vinci parties as vicariously liable for the Bristman accident under the peculiar risk doctrine. Even assuming for the sake of argument that this evidence was not presented to Progressive and Wilshire at the time the Vinci parties tendered their defense, the evidence arose during the Bristman Lawsuit in which Progressive\u2019s and Wilshire\u2019s respective insureds, Meza and Western, played the pivotal roles for which Progressive and Wilshire were defending them. The trial court in this Defense Lawsuit judicially noticed that Progressive and Wilshire had notice of plaintiff Bristman\u2019s contentions and supporting facts in the Bristman Lawsuit. While an insurer need not continuously investigate the potential for coverage after making an informed decision on coverage at the time of tender, if available information from other sources later shows otherwise, a duty to defend may then arise. <em>(Gunderson v. Fire Ins. Exchange, supra, </em>37 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1113-1114; see <em>Marie Y. v. General Star Indemnity Co., supra, </em>110 Cal.App.4th at p. 957; Croskey, <em>supra, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 7:519, 7:519.5, p. 7B-9.)</p>\n<p id=\"b57-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>As for the notion of complete strangers, the omnibus clauses at issue cover <em>vicarious </em>insureds. One or more of the Vinci parties has been shown to be potentially vicariously liable under the peculiar risk doctrine for Meza\u2019s and Western\u2019s conduct in the Bristman accident. As one treatise has explained, \u201c[over] time, the provisions specifying who was insured under the [standard automobile insurance] policy were structured to encompass three broad categories of insureds: (1) the named insured (owner) of the specified auto(s), (2) permissive users, and (3) any person or organization legally responsible for the use of such automobile by the owner or permissive user [termed \u2018vicarious insureds\u2019].\u201d (Malecki et al., The Additional Insured Book (2000) Commercial Auto Insurance, ch. 15, pp. 271, 275 (hereafter Malecki).) As this treatise further elucidates, \u201cWithin the category of <em>vicarious insureds </em>are persons or organizations who may be liable for the conduct of any insured in the preceding two categories [i.e., named insured and permissive user]. For example, this would provide insured status to the owner of a construction project with respect to a claim made by a third party who is injured in an accident involving a contractor\u2019s auto.\u201d (Malecki, ch. 15, p. 275.) This example aptly describes the situation before us.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b57-4\">Following the trail of this \u201cstranger\u201d further, Progressive and Wilshire also assert that a vicarious insured is less of an \u201cinsured\u201d than a named insured or a permissive user, and is liable only if it is responsible for <em>placing </em>the driver behind the wheel. Otherwise, \u201ca form complaint with overlapping allegations concerning employment, agency, ownership and use of the vehicle will give rise to an immediate duty to defend . . . some, if not all, strangers to the use or operation of the vehicle.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b57-5\">We do not see it this way. The language of the insurance policies does not differentiate between those considered \u201cinsureds.\u201d Within their respective <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>realms, a vicarious insured is as much an \u201cinsured\u201d as a named insured or a permissive insured. As the Croskey treatise has observed, \u201cThe insurer\u2019s duty to defend the \u2018insured\u2019 includes both the named insured(s) and anyone else included in the policy\u2019s definition of \u2018insured.\u2019 \u201d (Croskey, <em>supra, </em>\u00b6 7:514.5, p. 7B-7.) And the cases upon which Progressive and Wilshire rely for their behind-the-wheel placement limitation involved a negligent entrustment relationship <em>(City of San Buenaventura </em>v. <em>Allianz Ins. Co. </em>(1992) 9 Cal.App.4th 402 [11 Cal.Rptr.2d 742]) or an employment relationship <em>(Younker v. County of San Diego </em>(1991) 233 Cal.App.3d 1324 [285 Cal.Rptr. 319] and <em>Government Employees Ins. Co. v. Gibraltar Casualty Co. </em>(1986) 184 Cal.App.3d 163 [229 Cal.Rptr. 57]). These cases do not purport to restrict the scope of vicarious insured liability to only these venues of behind-the-wheel placement. These cases simply involved particular vicarious theories: negligent entrustment and employment. A particular vicarious liability theory is involved here as well: It is called the peculiar risk doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-4\">Continuing along the \u201cstranger\u201d path, Progressive and Wilshire note that the Vinci parties have not paid any premiums for those insurance policies. We note that neither do most permissive users, and no one disputes they are \u201cinsureds.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b58-5\">Progressive and Wilshire also point to the trial court\u2019s concern in the Defense Lawsuit that the \u201comnibus clause does not, and should not, insulate a landowner whose own negligence created a dangerous condition resulting in injury to a third party, by requiring a contractor who does nothing other than follow the landowner\u2019s plan to defend and indemnify the negligent landowner.\u201d We agree. In the present case, though, we have imposed the duty to defend only in the context of the landowner\u2019s (actually, here, the developer/general contractor/grading contractor\u2019s) potential vicarious liability under the peculiar risk doctrine. The landowner is still <em>directly </em>liable for its <em>\u201cown </em>negligence,\u201d and the vicarious insurer providing a defense to the landowner may have a right to be reimbursed for defense costs allocable to claims for which there was no potential vicarious coverage under the policy. <em>(Buss, supra, </em>16 Cal.4th at p. 50.)</p>\n<p id=\"b58-6\">Finally, the weakness of Progressive\u2019s and Wilshire\u2019s argument against a duty to defend the potential vicarious liability here is highlighted by the four cases upon which they rely most to make that argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-7\">In <em>City of San Buenaventura v. Allianz Ins. Co., supra, 9 </em>Cal.App.4th 402, the city unsuccessfully claimed it was a vicarious insured entitled to a defense under a negligent entrustment theory. The facts showed, however, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>that the city did not negligently entrust the car to the accident-causing driver. The city had contacted the vehicle\u2019s owner, who did so. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 404, 406.)</p>\n<p id=\"b59-4\">In <em>Safeco Ins. Co. of America </em>v. <em>Parks </em>(2004) 122 Cal.App.4th 779 [19 Cal.Rptr.3d 17], the person ultimately denied vicarious insured status had to have been a member of a particular household. All of the information from the household members and other interested parties indicated that this person was not such a member. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 792-793.)</p>\n<p id=\"b59-5\">And then there is the opinion in <em>Chicken Delight of Cal., Inc. v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. </em>(1973) 35 Cal.App.3d 841 [111 Cal.Rptr. 79]. That opinion did posit, relying in turn on the fourth case to which Progressive and Wilshire <em>look\u2014Wint v. Fidelity &amp; Casualty Co. </em>(1973) 9 Cal.3d 257 [107 Cal.Rptr. 175, 507 P.2d 1383] (Wint)\u2014that vicarious insured status pivots upon the reasonable expectations of the named insured. <em>(Chicken Delight, supra, </em>at pp. 859-861.) The trouble is that the <em>Chicken Delight </em>opinion upon which Progressive and Wilshire rely was but a single justice-signed concurring opinion in a Court of Appeal case, and that concurrence has not been adopted in its nearly 36 years of existence. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 850-865.) Furthermore, the court in <em>Wint, </em>after noting that the reasonable expectations principle traditionally applies in the context of insurance policy ambiguity, concluded: \u201c[I]t would be unreasonable for [the named insured] to have assumed that part of the premium he paid for the policy was to purchase the protection of a defense to someone claiming to be an additional insured, when such person, <em>because of a clear exclusionary clause in the policy, </em>actually had no basis for sustaining his claim of being covered thereunder.\u201d <em>(Wint, supra, 9 </em>Cal.3d at pp. 264\u2014265, italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b59-6\">Although we have found that Progressive and Wilshire owed the Vinci parties a duty to defend them pursuant to potential vicarious liability under the peculiar risk doctrine, we add two closing thoughts concerning American. The first thought is that \u201cwhere more than one insurer owes a duty to defend, a defense by one constitutes no excuse of the failure of any other insurer to perform.\u201d <em>(Wint, supra, 9 </em>Cal.3d at p. 263.) And the second thought, already expressed, is that Progressive and Wilshire may have a right to be reimbursed for defense costs allocable solely to claims for which there was no potential vicarious coverage under their policies. <em>(Buss, supra, </em>16 Cal.4th at p. 50.)<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b60-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b60-4\">The judgments in favor of Progressive and Wilshire are reversed to the extent they conclude that Progressive and Wilshire had no duty to defend the Vinci parties in the Bristman Lawsuit under the potential vicarious liability theory of the peculiar risk doctrine. American is awarded its costs on appeal. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 8.278(a)(1), (2).)</p>\n<p id=\"b60-5\">Scotland, P. J., and Sims, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-6\">A petition for a rehearing was denied January 6, 2010, and respondents\u2019 petition for review by the Supreme Court was denied March 18, 2010, S179691. George, C. J., did not participate therein.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b48-8\"> The summary judgment motions of the Vinci parties in the Bristman Lawsuit were filed after American had tendered the defense of the Vinci parties to Progressive and Wilshire. Progressive and Wilshire were involved in the Bristman Lawsuit from the outset, defending their respective insureds, Meza and Western. Furthermore, the existence of triable issues regarding retained control and peculiar risk was fully litigated in the Vinci parties\u2019 summary judgment motions in the Bristman Lawsuit.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b48-9\"> Apparently, Bristman has already settled with the Vinci parties, Meza, and Western.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b51-13\"> Also, an insurer is not permitted to avoid its duty to defend by seeking declaratory relief based on facts in dispute in the underlying liability action, because establishing certain facts in the declaratory relief action could prejudice the insured in the liability action. <em>(Montrose, supra, </em>6 Cal.4th at p. 301; see Croskey, <em>supra, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 7:668, 7:669, p. 7B-59 (rev. # 1, 2009).) The solution to this dilemma is to stay the declaratory relief action pending resolution of the liability action. (Croskey, <em>supra, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 7:668, 7:669, p. 7B-59.) Given the procedural posture of this case (see fns. 1 &amp; 2, <em>ante) </em>and certain undisputed facts, we are able to address here whether there is a triable issue of material fact that American\u2019s insureds, the Vinci parties, were potentially vicariously liable in the Bristman Lawsuit under the theory of retained control establishing agency or under the doctrine of peculiar risk, without prejudice to those insureds in the Bristman Lawsuit.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b52-18\">See footnote, <em>ante, </em>page 18.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b55-7\"> TRII is the developer of the Project and one of the Vinci parties here.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b56-8\"> <em>Castro </em>also encompassed the <em>direct </em>liability theory of limited retained control under Restatement Second of Torts, section 414. There is no incompatibility, though, between this direct theory of limited retained control and the vicarious theory of peculiar risk. As <em>Castro </em>explained, \u201cThe peculiar risk doctrine does not depend upon the degree of control over the work retained by the employer; it depends upon the risk peculiar to the work contracted to be performed.\u201d <em>(Castro, supra, </em>114 Cal.App.3d at p. 518.) In a special verdict, the <em>Castro </em>jury found liability on the peculiar risk doctrine. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 509.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b57-6\"> The applicable California insurance statute on vicarious insureds, Insurance Code section 11580.1, subdivision (b)(4), deleted in 1993 the vicarious-based language \u201clegally responsible for the use of.\u201d (Stats. 1993, ch. 408, \u00a7 1, pp. 2262-2263.) Neither the legislative history nor the parties shed light on this deletion. The Progressive and Wilshire insurance policies, as noted, contain the standard vicarious insured language, or its equivalent, of \u201c[ajnyone liable for the conduct of an \u2018insured\u2019 described above [i.e., the named insured or permissive user] but only to the extent of that liability.\u201d (Malecki, <em>supra, </em>ch. 15, p. 277, exhibit 15.3.)</p>\n<p id=\"b57-7\">Furthermore, we must acknowledge another treatise that states generally that \u201c[o]ne is not \u2018legally responsible\u2019 for the operation of another vehicle where one hires the owner of the vehicle to perform certain tasks, and the owner of the vehicle operates it in a manner causing injury while performing such tasks.\u201d (8 Couch on Insurance (3d ed. 1997) \u00a7 111:48, p. 111-79.) However, this same treatise goes on to note that this principle does not apply, for example, to a general contractor who has directed the driving of a subcontractor\u2019s truck in making a delivery to the construction site; in that situation, the general contractor may be deemed within the omnibus clause of the subcontractor\u2019s truck liability policy for injuries sustained by a third person while the truck was being so used. <em>(Id., </em>\u00a7 111:54, p. 111-87.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b59-7\"> In light of our resolution and the limited context of the summary judgment/adjudication motions before us, it is more appropriate for the trial court to consider the remaining issues of whether Progressive\u2019s coverage is primary to American\u2019s and whether Progressive may not allocate defense fees and costs with American under Insurance Code section 11580.9, subdivision (g).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
