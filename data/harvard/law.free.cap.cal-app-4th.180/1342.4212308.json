He contends that the verdicts are not supported by substantial evidence. We disagree and affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1216-7\">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</p>\n<p id=\"b1216-8\">In a three-count information, appellant was charged in count 1 with making criminal threats in violation of Penal Code section 422.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He was charged in count 2 with attempted criminal threats (\u00a7\u00a7 664, 422), and in count 3 with giving false information to a police officer (\u00a7 148.9, subd. (a)). It was further alleged as to counts 1 and 2 that appellant had suffered a prior conviction and had not remained free of custody for five years before committing the current felonies. (\u00a7 667.5, subd. (b).) Appellant pleaded not guilty. The jury convicted him on all three counts. After waiving a jury trial on the prior conviction, appellant admitted the allegation. He was sentenced on May 13, 2008, to a total of five years in state prison plus various fines and assessments. Appellant filed a timely notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1216-9\">STATEMENT OF THE FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b1216-10\">1. <em>The Incident at the Gas Station</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1216-11\">This case stems from what should have been a nonevent between two motorists: appellant and Michael Ibarra. Ibarra\u2019s 14-year-old son, A.I., was a passenger in Ibarra\u2019s car.</p>\n<p id=\"b1216-12\">The Ibarras and appellant never knew each other until August 8, 2007, when they met at an ARCO gas station.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Both arrived, in their respective <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1345\">*1345</page-number>cars, at about the same time. Ibarra believed that appellant was blocking access to the pumps. (A.I. actually believed appellant had cut them off as they approached a pump.) Ibarra asked appellant to move his car. In a sarcastic tone of voice, appellant told Ibarra to make that request in Spanish. Even though Ibarra speaks Spanish, he repeated his request in English. Again appellant told him to ask, politely, in Spanish. Appellant then went into the store to pay for his gas.</p>\n<p id=\"b1217-5\">Perturbed, Ibarra followed appellant into the store and asked him again to move his car. And once more appellant said\u2014in Spanish\u2014to make the request politely in Spanish. When it became clear appellant was not going to cooperate, Ibarra said, \u201cWell, fuck you, then,\u201d and returned to his car, where he waited by the driver\u2019s side for appellant to finish fueling.</p>\n<p id=\"b1217-6\">Once he finished, appellant got back in his car, opened a beer bottle, and gestured as if offering some to Ibarra. Ibarra \u201cgave him the bird as he did that,\u201d and appellant smiled at Ibarra. Appellant drove forward, slowly, until he was even with Ibarra. Again he picked up the bottle and gestured as if offering Ibarra a drink. And again, Ibarra gave appellant \u201cthe middle finger.\u201d Finally, appellant drove away.</p>\n<p id=\"b1217-7\">Ibarra repositioned his car so he could fill his gas tank. As he started to use his debit card at the paypoint kiosk next to the pump, he noticed that appellant had not left after all. Instead, he had circled and was driving back toward Ibarra. Ibarra canceled his purchase and attempted to leave in order to avoid a second confrontation. Since another car was in front of his, Ibarra backed up, turned, and started forward. That is when appellant got out of his car and walked toward Ibarra.</p>\n<p id=\"b1217-8\">Appellant called a nearby patron to interpret and, in an aggressive tone of voice, told this person several times to ask Ibarra, \u201cDo you want to fuck with me now?\u201d The interpreter said in Spanish to appellant, \u201cI think he understands you,\u201d and the interpreter left.</p>\n<p id=\"b1217-9\">But appellant did not leave. He stood about seven feet from Ibarra on the passenger side of Ibarra\u2019s car, and he lifted his shirt to display what Ibarra <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1346\">*1346</page-number>and A.I. believed was a weapon tucked into a waistband. Although father and son described it differently, they both said the weapon was in a holster and believed it was either a handgun or pistol. This got A.i.\u2019s \u201cheart pumping. I got a little scared. . . . Like he might pull the gun out of the holster and shoot us or something.\u201d Ibarra wanted to drive away but still could not; other vehicles were blocking his car. He said that during the minute or so that appellant displayed his weapon, \u201c. . . the game changed. I was in fear for my life. I was in fear for my son\u2019s life. . . . The only thing that kept me there was I was completely backed in. ... I was afraid for my son and my life. I was afraid .... I was have [sic] afraid of losing my life that day.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1218-5\">While Ibarra looked for an escape route, appellant harangued him. In Spanish, appellant uttered profanities, asked Ibarra if he was \u201ca faggot,\u201d said words to the effect that he should have more respect for people from Jalisco (a state in Mexico).</p>\n<p id=\"b1218-6\">Then\u2014still in Spanish\u2014appellant said, \u201cI should kill you. I will kill you.\u201d Appellant also said, \u201cI ought to kill you and\u201d\u2014pointing to A.I.\u2014\u201cthe stupid mother fucker too.\u201d Worse yet, appellant said he ought to kill them \u201cahorita,\u201d which means \u201cright now.\u201d Finally, appellant said, \u201cNow get the fuck out of here.\u201d Ibarra obeyed him.</p>\n<p id=\"b1218-7\">A.I. saw appellant hold up the beer bottle as he was leaving the station. A.I. speaks no Spanish and could not understand what appellant was saying. After appellant lifted up his jacket to display it, A.I. saw what he thought was a silver gun in a black holster. Seeing the weapon made A.I. feel uncomfortable.</p>\n<p id=\"b1218-8\">Ibarra tried to get a grip on his emotions as he drove away. He had been \u201cscared to death during the whole ordeal.\u201d Within about 15 minutes\u2014once he was on the freeway and \u201cout of harm\u2019s way\u201d\u2014he called 9-1-1 and told the operator that he was \u201cscared shitless.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1218-9\">The operator told Ibarra to return to the gas station and wait across the street; the police would be approaching in \u201csilent mode.\u201d Police Officer William Robinson and his partner interviewed the Ibarras, viewed the surveillance tape, and then searched the area and found appellant within walking distance of the gas station. They detained him until Ibarra identified him. Appellant was not carrying a gun; instead, he had a folding knife with a black <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1347\">*1347</page-number>handle. The weapon was in a black nylon holster with a Smith &amp; Wesson logo on it.</p>\n<p id=\"b1219-5\">2. <em>The Incident with the Police</em><footnotemark><em>*</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1219-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1219-7\">1. <em>Substantial Evidence Supports the Conviction Under Count 1</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1219-8\">Appellant contends there was insufficient evidence to support his conviction of making a criminal threat against Ibarra (count 1). Appellant\u2019s contention lacks merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1219-9\">The standard for appellate review of the sufficiency of the evidence to support a criminal conviction is well established. \u201cClaims challenging the sufficiency of the evidence to uphold a judgment are generally reviewed under the substantial evidence standard. Under that standard, \u2018 \u201can appellate court reviews the entire record in the light most favorable to the prosecution to determine whether it contains evidence that is reasonable, credible, and of solid value, from which a rational trier of fact could find [the elements of the crime] beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d \u2019 [Citations.] \u2018 \u201c Tf the circumstances reasonably justify the trier of fact\u2019s findings, the opinion of the reviewing court that the circumstances might also be reasonably reconciled with a contrary finding does not warrant a reversal of the judgment.\u2019 \u201d \u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(In re George T. </em>(2004) 33 Cal.4th 620, 630-631 [16 Cal.Rptr.3d 61, 93 P.3d 1007] <em>(George </em>T.).) Furthermore, \u201cIn deciding the sufficiency of the evidence, a reviewing court resolves neither credibility issues nor evidentiary conflicts. [Citation.] Resolution of conflicts and inconsistencies in the testimony is the exclusive province of the trier of fact. [Citation.] Moreover, unless the testimony is physically impossible or inherently improbable, testimony of a single witness is sufficient to support a conviction. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(People v. Young </em>(2005) 34 Cal.4th 1149, 1181 [24 Cal.Rptr.3d 112, 105 P.3d 487].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1219-10\">In <em>George T., supra, </em>33 Cal.4th at page 630, the Supreme Court enumerated the elements of a criminal threat under section 422: \u201cThe prosecution must prove \u2018(1) that the defendant \u201cwillfully threaten[ed] to commit a crime which will result in death or great bodily injury to another person,\u201d (2) that the defendant made the threat \u201cwith the specific intent that the statement ... is to be taken as a threat, even if there is no intent of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1348\">*1348</page-number>actually carrying it out,\u201d (3) that the threat\u2014which may be \u201cmade verbally\u201d\u2014was \u201con its face and under the circumstances in which it [was] made, ... so unequivocal, unconditional, immediate, and specific as to convey to the person threatened, a gravity of purpose and an immediate prospect of execution of the threat,\u201d (4) that the threat actually caused the person threatened \u201cto be in sustained fear for his or her own safety or for his or her immediate family\u2019s safety,\u201d and (5) that the threatened person\u2019s fear was \u201creasonable]\u201d under the circumstances.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Ibid.; </em>see also \u00a7 422.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1220-5\">We list the above quoted elements below, followed by the reasons why more than substantial evidence supports each such element here:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1220-6\"><em>First element\u2014willful threat to commit a crime that will result in death or great bodily injury: </em>There was solid, competent evidence that appellant displayed a weapon and said, \u201cI will kill you.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1220-7\"><em>Second element\u2014specific intent: </em>The evidence shows that for up to one minute appellant was close to Ibarra\u2019s car, displaying the weapon, making pejorative statements about Ibarra and his son, and saying words to the effect that he could and would kill them. There is no reason for appellant to do what he did and say what he said if he had not had the specific intent that the Ibarras interpret his actions as a threat.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1220-8\"><em>Third element\u2014unequivocal, unconditional, immediate threat: </em>Mr. Ibarra testified that appellant not only said, \u201cI will kill you,\u201d but said (in Spanish) that he was going to do so \u201cright now.\u201d As if to stress the immediacy of his intentions, appellant did not say <em>\u201cahora,\u201d </em>which means \u201cnow.\u201d He said <em>\u201cahorita,\u201d </em>which means \u201cright now.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Appellant\u2019s proximity to the victim and his threatening gesture added weight to his words.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1220-9\"><em>Fourth element\u2014the threat actually caused sustained, reasonable fear: </em>Mr. Ibarra testified clearly and more than once that he was horribly scared, and his fright was not fleeting. Regardless of who was at fault during the first confrontation, it had ended. Appellant had driven away. But then appellant circled and returned with the obvious intent of confronting Ibarra again and, this time, frightening him. In light of the (albeit recent) history between these people, appellant amply succeeded. Facing what he thought was a gun and hearing words to the effect that he and his son were about to be killed, Mr. Ibarra was in sustained fear for his and his son\u2019s life. The fear lasted not only through the minute or so that appellant stood there exposing his weapon, but for up to 15 minutes after Ibarra drove away. It is entirely reasonable that he would react as he did for as long as he did. That is exactly what appellant wanted to accomplish.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1220-11\">Appellant claims we should not consider the victims\u2019 time on the freeway\u201415 minutes\u2014in calculating the last element\u2014\u201csustained fear.\u201d He <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1349\">*1349</page-number>argues that as shown on the security videotape, the threat itself did not exceed 40 seconds.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> This argument ignores human nature. \u201cSustained fear\u201d refers to a state of mind. As one court put it, \u201c[d]efining the word \u2018sustained\u2019 [in section 422] by its opposites, we find that it means a period of time that extends beyond what is momentary, fleeting, or transitory.\u201d <em>(People v. Allen </em>(1995) 33 Cal.App.4th 1149, 1151, 1156 [40 Cal.Rptr.2d 7] <em>(Allen).)</em><footnotemark><em>6</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The word fear, of course, describes the emotion the victim experiences.</p>\n<p id=\"b1221-5\">In light of the facts and circumstances we have noted, the jury reasonably could have found that appellant\u2019s actions created a sustained fear, a state of mind that was certainly more than momentary, fleeting, or transitory. We submit that a person who hears someone say, \u201cI will kill you . . . right now,\u201d coupled with seeing a weapon, is quite justified in remaining \u201cscared shitless\u201d\u2014as Mr. Ibarra put it\u2014for 15 minutes.  \u201cFifteen minutes of fear of a defendant who is armed, mobile, and at large, and who has threatened to kill the victim and [his son], is more than sufficient to constitute \u2018sustained\u2019 fear for purposes of this element of section 422.\u201d <em>(Allen, supra, </em>33 Cal.App.4th at p. 1156.) But even if we accept appellant\u2019s argument, we believe that the minute during which Ibarra heard the threat and saw appellant\u2019s weapon qualifies as \u201csustained\u201d under the statute. When one believes he is about to die, a minute is longer than \u201cmomentary, fleeting, or transitory.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1221-6\">The facts in this case differ sharply from a good example of momentary fear that is found in <em>In re Ricky T. </em>(2001) 87 Cal.App.4th 1132 [105 Cal.Rptr.2d 165], in which a student threatened to \u201cget\u201d a teacher, but made no physical movements or gestures. The teacher responded by sending the student to the school office; the teacher did not call the police until the next day; and there had been no prior history between the defendant and the victim. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 1135-1136.) The court found the teacher\u2019s fear to be fleeting. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1140.) As discussed above, the facts here are quite different and constitute substantial evidence to support the guilty verdict on count 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b1221-7\">2. <em>Substantial Evidence Supports the Conviction under Count 3</em><footnotemark><em>*</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1222-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1350\">*1350</page-number>DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b1222-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1222-6\">Rubin, Acting P.

In <em>Allen, </em>the defendant used profanity. Then he declared: \u201c \u2018I\u2019m gonna kill you. I\u2019m gonna kill you and your daughter.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Allen, supra, </em>33 Cal.App.4th at p. 1153.) As he spoke he pointed a gun at the victim. Then the defendant left the scene. <em>(Ibid.) </em>The victim called the police, who arrested the defendant about 15 minutes later. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 1153, 1155-1156.) Thus, as in this case, the threat did not last 15 minutes, but the fear continued for that period after the defendant had fled.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1221-10\">See footnote, <em>ante, </em>page 1342.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
