But there-is. no necessity that the courts of the United States should follow such careless precedents.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b114-10\">Where a suit was brought in which the plaintiff was described aj a citizen of Prance, against the Pennsylvania Railroad Company, without any averment that the defendants were a corporation under the laws of Pennsylvania, or that the place of business of the corporation was there, or that its corporators, managers, or directors were citizens of Pennsylvania, the -absence of such an averment was fata5 to the jurisdiction of the.court.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b114-11\">This case was brought up, by writ of error, -from the Circuit. Court of the. United States for the Western. District of Pennsylvania.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b114-12\">The facts in the case are stated in the opinion of the court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b114-13\">It was submitted, upon printed arguments, by <em>Mr. Kennedy </em>and <em>Mr. Alden, </em>for the plaintiff in error, and <em>Mr. Snowden, </em>for the defendants in-error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A7x\">But as the point of jurisdiction was not mentioned in the arguments, which w\u00e9re directed exclusively to other points, it is not thought, necessary to give them.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b115-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>Mr. Justice GRIER</author>\n<p id=\"Au\">delivered the opinion of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-4\">The caption of this suit, and the declaration, describe the plaintiff as a citizen of France, but contain no averment as to the citizenship of. the defendant. Nor does it state whether \u201c The Pennsylvania Railroad Company \u201d is a corporation or a private association, or the name of an individual. The declaration avers that the defendants are transporters of emigrants for hire, and undertook to convey the plaintiff and his wile from Philadelphia to Pittsburg, but did it in such a negligent and careless manner that his wife was frozen to death on her passage. The defendant pleaded in abatement, another action pending for the same cause of action between the '\u2019-ame parties, in the District Court of Alleghany county. .To this plea the plaintiff demurred; and the court gave \u201c judgment upon the demurrer in favor of the defendants.\u201d Whereupon the plaintiff brought this writ of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-5\">The question raised by the plea in abatement, in this case, is one of considerable importance, and on which there, is some conflict of opinion and decision, but the judgment of the court below on the plea is not subject to our revision on a writ of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-6\">The. twenty-second section of the Judiciary Act, which defines what decrees or judgments in civil actions may be made the subjects of appeals or writ of error, provides, \u201cthat there shall be no reversal on such writ of error, for error in ruling any' plea, in abatement other than a plea to the jurisdiction of the court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b115-7\">The question of jurisdiction has not been made the subject of plea or exception, nor is it necessary, where it is patent on the face of the record. The judgment of the court, so far as the record is concerned, docs not distinctly show whether the court quashed the writ on the plea in abatement, or dismissed the suit for want of jurisdiction, as it might well have. done. In Pennsylvania, it is not usual to make a record of the judgment in legal form. The word \u201cjudgment\u201d for the party in whose favor it is, being the usual minute made by the clerk, from which a formal record of judgment may be made, but seldom or ever is made. It stands as a symbol to represent what the judgment ought to be, and therefore can never be erroneous. But there is no necessity that the courts of the United States should follow such careless precedents.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-8\">On a demurrer the court will look to the first error in pleading, and if the declaration does not show that the court has jurisdiction of the parties, it may dismiss the cause on that ground. In this case the declaration states the plaintiff to be a citizen of France, but gives no character as to the citizenship of the defendant. Tbs name is most probabiv not intended to. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>designate an individual; if not, the record does not state that it is a corporation incorporated by the laws of Pennsylvania, or having its place of business there, or that its corporators, managers, or directors are citizens of Pennsylvania, nor can the want of such averment be supplied by inference from the name. It is true, the' act of Congress describes the jurisdiction of the court to be \u201cwhere an'alien is a party,\u201d without describing the character of the other party; and the pleader may have been led into the error by looking no farther. But the constitution which is the superior law, defines the jurisdiction to be, \u201c between citizens of a state, and foreign states, citizens, or subjects;\u201d and, although it has been decided, (Mason <em>v. </em>The Blaireau, 2 Cranch, 264,) that, the courts of the United States will entertain jurisdiction where all the parties are aliens if none of them object to it, yet it does not appear in this case that the defendant is an alien.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-5\">It follows, therefore, that whatever construction be put on this record, the judgment of the court below must be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-6\">\n<em>Order.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b116-7\">This cause came on to be heard oh the transcript of the record, from the Circuit Court of the United States for the Western District of Pennsylvania, and was argued by counsel. On consideration whereof, it is now here ordered and adjudged by this court, that the judgment of the said Circuit Court, in this cause, be, and the same is hereby affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
