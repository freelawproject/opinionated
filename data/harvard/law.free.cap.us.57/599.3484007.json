What follows is, on its face, only explanatory, and should not have'been construed to convert the time of payment into a penalty or.forfeiture. ' .'</p>\n<p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b613-6\">The contract, must be construed as a whole, and the intention of the parties thus gathered, is to be carried into effect.</p>\n<p data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b613-7\">It is submitted, that it' was not the agreement of the parties that so heavy a forfeiture as the sum of $2,115, should be incurred on a compromise merely by failure to pay at the day, nor is it in any manner susceptible of such construction, unless- it be taken from the last clause in the nature of a proviso. But this clause does not necessarily require such conslruction; referring it to the contract, it relates to the entering of satisfaction on .the judgment and to that only, so that the explanatory addendum would read thus : the judgment although affirmed, shall not be obligatory for more than the above sum of $10,000, to be paid as aforesaid, and the judgment shall be entered, satisfied if that sum is paid on the day appointed for its payment herein above.</p>\n<p data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b613-8\">\u25a0 -In support of this view, I refer to Story\u2019s Equity, vol. 2, \u00a7 13, 14, where the principle is stated, \u201c that wherever a penalty is inserted , merely to secure the performance or enjoyment of a \u25a0collateral object, the latter is considered as the principal intent of the instrument, and the penalty is deemed only as accessory,\u201d &amp;e.</p>\n<p data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b613-9\">On the first point, then, it is respectfully submitted that the judgment should be reversed, because execution was allowed for a sum exceeding that stipulated in the contract of the parlies, and subject to which contract the judgment had been affirmed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b614-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>On the second point \u2014</p>\n<p data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b614-5\">It is submitted, that no execution should have issued until the attachment set out in the bill of exceptions had been disposed of. ..</p>\n<p data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b614-6\">By the statutes of Virginia the attaching creditors obtained a lien on the property of their debtor from the time the process was served, and the garnishee- (Early) could not pay to the defendant in error,'without violating the law, and subjecting himself to the risk of paying twice. Code of Virginia, (1849) p. 603, $ 11, 12; p. 605, \u00a7 17.</p>\n<p data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b614-7\">So entirely is the garnishee protected, in cases of attachment, from the action of the absent debtor, that he is not even responsible for interest, whilst, pending the attachment, he is restrained from parting with the effects in his hands. 1 Sergent on Attachments, 169; Fitzgerald <em>v. </em>Caldwell, 2 Dallas, 215; same case, 4 Ib. 251; Willings <em>v. </em>Consequa, 1 Peters\u2019s Cir. Court Rep. 172; Erskine <em>v. </em>Staley, 12 Leigh, 406.</p>\n<p data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b614-8\">The reason why the garnishee is protected from interest is, that he is not allowed to part with the principal, until the rights of parties are settled under the attachment.</p>\n<p data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b614-9\">In allowing these attachments from a State court to be regarded by the federal .court, when asked to direct execution to-be issued against the garnishee, there is no collision between \u25a0the respective judiciaries. Far less is the action of the federal court made subordinate to that of the State. The citizen is fully subject to the process of each, on matters within their respective jurisdictions; and although it were conceded that the State court must yield, when a federal court has taken jurisdiction properly, yet this must be in a case when the right litigated, \u25a0 or the nature of the controversy is the same in both courts, and where, unless one jurisdiction was paramount, there would, arise collision. Such is in no manner the case here. The federal court, in disallowing executions, because of the pendency of-these attachment's, decides only that the judgment creditor is not entitled to execution, because, since the judgment was-rendered, other rights had intervened \u2014 . rights not asserted to question or challenge the authority which rendered the judgment, but, in fact, affirming such authority, and relying upon it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b614-11\">The judgment against Early, established a property in Rogers, which property the \u2022 creditors of the latter, through the State court, seek to subject to payment of, their debts, and they may do this without the slightest interference- with the authority of the Court that rendered the judgment.</p>\n<p data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b614-12\">I am'informed by counsel,- on the other side, that he shall ask the court to correct the judgment of affirmance, so as to allow <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>interest on the amount of the verdict, from its date. On this I have to say, that if it be error, it was error in the judgment of ' the court below, and from which there is no appeal,\u2019 and of course cannot be corrected here.</p>\n<p data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b615-5\">But if I am right in my construction of the contract, under which the \u2019judgment was affirmed, the parties'have waived the ..interest, which the law of Virginia would attach to a verdict, by agreeing to a sum without interest.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b615-6\"><em>Mr. </em>Chase-, for the defendants in error, said, that the questions presented were these:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b615-7\">I. The sum of $10,000 not. having been paid by the 1st of September, 1852, according to the terms of the affirmance agreement, are the judgment plaintiffs entitled to the full amount of the judgment affirmed ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b615-8\">II. Can the proceedings in the State court be set up to arrest the action of the federal court in enforcing its own judgment by its own process ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b615-9\">III. There is a third point which arises, both on the writ of error and' on motion, namely, are the judgment plaintiffs entitled to interest on the amount of the judgment affirmed, and from what time ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b615-10\">I. The answer to the first question depends on the terms of the agreement. That hardly seems to admit of two interpretations. It consists of two parts. The first stipulates that Early shall pay to Rogers and Rogers $10,000 by the 1st of September, which sum, so paid, the latter agree to receive in full satisfaction of the original judgment; the second expresses the same understanding in somewhat a different phraseology: the judgment is to be affirmed, but is not to be obligatory for more than $10,000, on payment of which sum satisfaction is to be entered, provided the amount is paid on or before the 1st day of September next.</p>\n<p data-order=\"62\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b615-11\">Under the agreement the judgment was affirmed. This judgment was for $12,115. Early had a right to have it satisfied by payment of- $10,000 by the 1st September. He did not exercise that right, and therefore lost it. No later payment than on the 1st of September would avail, him, and he has offered none.</p>\n<p data-order=\"63\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b615-12\">It is claimed that the stipulation for the affirmance of the judgment, upon agreement to accept a less sum in satisfaction, if paid by a certain day, operates as a stipulation for a penalty, and ought not to be enforced. This is by no means, so. The original judgment was for a balance of account. Rogers and Rogers were pressed for money, and anxious for early payment. They were willing to accept a part soon, rather than risk the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>collection of the whole by process, in the uncertain future. Hence their agreement. The whole was no more than their due. The agreement to accept part was conditional. Early not having \u25a0 fulfilled the condition, they are justly entitled to the whole.</p>\n<p data-order=\"64\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b616-5\">II. The answer to the second question depends on the effect \u25a0 to be given to the various proceedings in the State court.</p>\n<p data-order=\"65\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b616-6\">All these suits, except two, were commenced after the institution of the suit in the District Court, and it is quite certain that the pendency of these constitutes no objection to the enforcement of the judgment of the court. Wallace <em>v. </em>McConnell, <em>13 </em>Peters, 136, is in point.</p>\n<p data-order=\"66\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b616-7\">Of th\u00e9 two, suits commenced prior to that of Rogers and Rog\u00e9rs, the first (Wilson\u2019s) has been prosecuted to final decree,20th November, 1851, (Record, p.28,) against Rogers for the debt, and against William Shrewsbury for payment, which decree seems to have been satisfied, as the record shows a judgment on a forthcoming bond against Shrewsbury and Lewis. There -is nothing to show, and no ground to suppose that Early can be made liable for any thing in this suit, in any event.</p>\n<p data-order=\"67\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b616-8\">The other suit (Sargent\u2019s) was commenced, by issuing the subpcenas On the 15th of June, but there is. nothing to show . when process was served on Early. The bill was not filed until July. Nothing has been done in this cause beyond the mere \u25a0filing of the bill; and the court will not presume, without proof, that process was served on Early so as to fix any liability on him-. 2 Rob..Prac. 201.</p>\n<p data-order=\"68\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b616-9\">But if both suits had been commenced, and process in both had been served on Early prior to the commencement of the suit against him in the District Court, it would have made no difference, and for several reasons :</p>\n<p data-order=\"69\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b616-10\">1. An attachment does not create a lien, but a mere contingent liability, which can only become fixed after judgment or decree, in the principal suit, and, in case, also, .that the debt due from the. garnishee has not been previously extinguished otherwise than by hi's voluntary act. Ex parte Foster, 2 Story, 151, 152; Embree <em>v. </em>Hanna, 5 Johns. 101.</p>\n<p data-order=\"70\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b616-11\">2. If a defendant would avail himself of a pending attachment against a subsequent suit for the debt attached,- he must plead the pendency of the attachment in abatement. Wallace v.-McConnell,-13 Pet. 151. After issue joined it is too late to plead in abatement. Payne <em>v. </em>Grimm, 2 Munf. 297; May <em>v. </em>State Bank, 2 Rob. 56.</p>\n<p data-order=\"71\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b616-12\">3. In the present case Early waited all objections to the proceeding in the District Court growing out of the pending'of the attachment suits. The record shows that he did plead the pending of some of these suits in abatement, and voluntarily <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>withdrew the plea and joined issue. Record\u2019, 57. He was fully aware, also, of the attachments when he consented to the affirmance of the judgment, arid it would be unreasonable to allow him to avail himself of grounds to evade payment, which, when he positively engaged to pay, he must have been understood to waive; for otherwise his engagements would amount to nothing.</p>\n<p data-order=\"72\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b617-5\">. IH. We claim that the court below erred in not correcting the judgment, by allowing interest on the verdict, and ask- that this error may be corrected. The original omission of interest in the judgment was, doubtless, ,a clerical error. The verdict was. for the balance of an account. The Code of Virginia is express, that \u201c if a verdict be rendered .hereafter, which does not allow interest, the sum thereby found shall -bear interest from its date-, whether the eause of action arose heretofore, or shall arise hereafter, and judgment shall be entered accordingly.\u201d Code of Virginia, 1840, c., 177, \u00a7 14, p.- 673.</p>\n<p data-order=\"73\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b617-6\">As the whole case is before the. court upon the writ of error, the court may, and we think should, correct this manifest error. At all events the court will allow interest upon the amount of the judgment, either from the date of the verdict or from affirmance, by way of damages. Rule 18.</p>\n<p data-order=\"74\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b617-7\">If defendant attached wishes to exempt himself from interest, he must bring the money into court. <em>2 </em>Rob.

Early,</p>\n<p id=\"b618-7\">By Cha as Fox, his attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-8\">John Rogers,</p>\n<p id=\"b618-9\">Joseph Rogers,</p>\n<p id=\"b618-10\">By James F. Meline, their attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-11\">\u201c On consideration whereof, it is now here ordered and adjudged by this court, that the judgment of the said District Court in this cause be, and the sam\u00e9 is hereby affirmed, with costs, in conformity to the preceding stipulations; and that the said plaintiffs recover against the said defendant, Samuel H. Early, one hundred and twenty-nine dollars and fifty-two- cents for their costs herein expended, and have execution therefor.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-12\">\u201cMay 27,--.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b618-13\">The mandate of this- court was issued in October, 1852, and spread upon the records of the District Court for the Western District-of Virginia. In January, 1853, an execution issued returnable to the March rules of that year. At the April term of that court, the plaintiff, Early, obtained a rule against Rogers &amp; Co., requiring them to show cause why the execution so sued out should not be quashed, and also why execution on the said judgment of the said Supreme Court should not be limited to the sum of ten thousand dollars, with interest thereon, from the 1st day of September, 1852, and the costs; and also why the same shall not be stayed until the further order of the court, on account of certain attachments and suggestions. Whereupon the court ordered the execution to'be quashed, but that the said Rogers &amp; Co. be allowed, to sue out their execution against said Early for the principal sum of $12,115, with costs, but without interest or damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-14\">The writ of error has been taken to bring this order awarding the execution to this court. We think the district judge interpreted the . agreement of the parties and the judgment of this court upbnlt, correctly. The parties made the reduction of the judgment to ten thousand dollars, dependent upon a condition, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>which has not been fulfilled. The plaintiff in error had obliged himself to comply with this condition, or to lose his claim for a deduction. We think the award of execution, for the amount contained in .the order, was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-5\">The motion to stay the execution, founded upon the fact that creditors of Rogers &amp; Co. had attached this debt, by service of garnishment on the plaintiff in the State courts, was addressed to the legal discretion of the District Court, and its judgment is not revisable by this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-6\">The .mere levy of an attachment upon an existing debt, by a creditor, does not authorize the garnishee to claim an exemption from the pursuit of his creditor. The attachment acts make no such provision for his benefit. It is the duty of the court wherein the suit against the garnishee by his creditor may be pending, upon a proper representation of the facts, to take measures that no injustice shall grow out of the double vexation. The court should ascertain if the attachment is prosecuted for a <em>bon t fide </em>debt, without collusion with the debtor, for an amount \u2022 corresponding to the debt, that no mischief to the security of the debt will-follow from a delay, and such other facts as maybe necessary for the protection and' security of the creditor... An order of the court to suspend, or to delay the creditor\u2019s suit, or his execution in whole or for a part, could be then made upon such conditions as would do no wrong to any one.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-7\">It is apparent that such inquiries are proper only for the court of original jurisdiction, in the exercise of the equity powers over proceedings an,' suitors before it, with the view to fulfil its great duty of administering justice in every case. We do not perceive in this record .evidence that the district judge has exercised his discretion unwisely.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-8\">We do not express any opinion upon the questions whether a writ of error was the proper remedy to bring this order befoie\u2019 us, nor whether attachments could be . levied from the State court upon a judgment or claim in the course of collection in the courts of the United States. Accepting the case as it has been made by the parties, and has been argued at the bar, our conclusion is, there is no error in the record, and the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-9\">\n<em>Order.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b619-10\">This cause came on to be heard on the transcript of the record from the District Court of the United States for the Western District of Virginia, and was argued by counsel. On consideration whereof it is now here ordered and adjudged by this court that the judgment of the said District Court in this cause be, and the same is hereby affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
