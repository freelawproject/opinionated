The first insertion was on Saturday, the 26th August, 1848; the last, on Wednesday, the 15th November, the day of the sale, being a period of eighty-two days only, including both days, namely, the day on which the notice first appeared, and the day of sale.</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b622-17\">The eleventh week ended, either on Friday, the 10th of November, or on Saturday, the 11th, according as the week is made to commence on the. day on which the notice first appeal\u2019s, or on the first succeeding Sunday thereafter: The twelfth week <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>could not expire until Friday the 17th, or Saturday the 18th November, and the earliest day on which the sale could' have been made was one of those days. It was made on the previous .Wednesday, the 15th November, before the twelve weeks had expired.</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b623-5\">By the charter of 1812, it was directed that the notice should \u201c be given,, by advertising, at least six months, where the property belongs to persons residing out of the United- States; three months, where it belongs to persons residing in the United States, but out of the District of Columbia; and six weeks, where it belongs to persons residing within the district.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b623-6\">The charter of 1820, superadded to the period of notice, the further requisition of weekly insertions of the advertisement, \u2022 <em>\u201c </em>once a week, for at least six months, three months, -or six weeks,\u201d according to the residence of the owner. Section 12. '</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ATk\">The act of 1824 changed the period of notice from months to weeks, but retained the further requirement of weekly insertions, \u201c once in each week, for at least twelve successive weeks.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b623-8\">There are, then, two requirements, as to notice, by the act of 1824: 1st, twelve w\u00e9eks notice;. and, 2d, the insertion of the advertisement once in each of those twelve weeks.</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b623-9\">The full period of twelve weeks\u2019 notice must be given. In Ronkendorff <em>v. </em>Taylor, 4 Peters, 361, the court say: \u201cA week is a definite period of time, commencing on Sunday, and ending on Saturday; \u201d and, being thus composed of seven days, twelve weeks cannot consist of less than eighty-four days. And that case sanctions the idea, that the-whole period of twelve weeks should elapse before the sale. Whether the-week be made to commence on-the day on which the notice is first published,'and to end on the seventh day thereafter; or to begin on the Sunday following the first day of the notice, and end on the succeeding Saturday, is immaterial in this case; the result \u2014 not twelve weeks\u2019 notice \u2014 is the same on either mode of computation. The first insertion was on Saturday, the 26th August. If the week commenced on that day and ended on the following Friday, there are but eighty-two days, including both day of notice and day of sale. If it began on Sunday, the 27th, and ended on the succeeding Saturday, there would be but eighty-one days, including both. And, if the true rule be to include the day on which the notice first appears, and to exclude the day of sale, there would still be but the same eighty-one days; \u2014 eleven weeks and four days.-</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b623-10\">The expression in the act of 1824 is: \u201c once in each week, for at least twelve successive weeks,\u201d not merely once in each week, but once in each week \u201cfor\u201d twelve weeks during or through that certain space of time; and not merely for twelve <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>Weeks, but for \u201cat least\u201d twelve successive -weeks, not less than that whole period.'</p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b624-5\">The notice, according to Ronkendorff <em>v. </em>Taylor, may b\u00e9 inserted' on any day in each of those twelve weeks, on the last day of the eleventh week and the first day of the twelfth week. But that rule was not meant, as the corporation-officers seem to have supposed, to authorize the collector to abridge the period of notice; to insert one advertisement in each of the, first eleven weeks and a twelfth on the fourth day after the end of the eleventh week, and to sell on that day and before the twelfth week had fully expired; The corporation by-law followed the words of the act of Congress. The collector has no dispensing-power.</p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b624-6\">All the analogies require the full term. \u2022 As the familiar instance of six months\u2019 notice to quit or four months\u2019 notice of publication against non-residents under pur acts of assembly: four or six whole months, less will not-do. In all judicial sales, .either by sheriff or trustee, the period of notice .is usually pre^. scribed, and the full term must be given. And as tq these tax - sales. 'The fourth point in Pratt and the Corporation, 8 Wheat. 681, as seen in the record, was whether sufficient notice had been given. After the first insertion of the advertisement, the amount of the taxes was changed without any change in the day of ' sale, so that the full period of notice was not; given after-such change. The sale was adjudged bad, \u2019</p>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b624-7\">So in Pope &amp; Hamner <em>v. </em>Headen, 5 Ala. R. 433. . The law required \u201c ninety days\u2019 notice \u201d of the sale, to .be published. in some newspaper. The advertisement was dated th.e 1st of November, 1839, and was then handed to. the publisher of the newspaper, was inserted therein weekly froqa the 6th of. November, which was the first day of publication, until the 29th of January, 1840, and -file, sale took place on the 3d of February,. 1840. Between the date of the advertisement and the day of sale there were more than ninety days; but between the first day of the publication, and the day \u00f3f sale there were-but eighty-nine days, excluding, as the court did there, the first, _ and including the last day. The date of the advertisement and the handing of it to the publisher within time were considered by the court; but the sale was held to be clearly void.</p>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b624-8\">In our case, counting from the date of the advertisement, the 25th of August instead of the 26th, the- day of. its publication, and even including the day of its date, and. also\u2019the day of sale, there are not eighty-four days,- but eighty-three only.</p>\n<p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b624-9\">See also Lyon et al. <em>v. </em>Hunt et al. 11 Ala. R. 295, for a fi.. . collection of the. cases.</p>\n<p data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b624-11\">It is not enough to give twelve or more insertions of the ad<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>vertisement. It may be continued twice or thrice a week, or even daily. In the early charters the. corporation began simply with the period of notice: six weeks, three months, six months. Weekly insertions were first sup.eradded by the charter of 1820, and have been continued by the act of 1824. But the law is not satisfied by a compliance with that requisite merely. Each requirement of the law must be observed. Here both, namely, \u201c twelve weeks at least,\u201d and weekly insertions, are essential to the validity of the sale. The non-observance of either destroys it, as much so as the omission .of both.</p>\n<p data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b625-5\">Neither of these requirements can, as to the other, be deemed the primary requisite. If either could be so considered, it would be the.period, of notice rather than the number of insertions.</p>\n<p data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b625-6\">It is purely a matter of positiye law. The rules are arbitrary; eleven weeks and four days might have answered just as well as twelve weeks; but the statute says twelve weeks, meaning twelve full or whole weeks. The language is clear and express; there is no room for construction or discretion. In 8 Wheat. 687, Judge Johnson asks: \u201c what have we to do with such inquiries in eases of positive enactment <em>1 </em>\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b625-7\">The act means that notice of the sale shall be given by publication for at least twelve weeks prior to the day of sale, which notice shall also be published once in 'each of those twelve weeks. \u2022 The object in naming the period of notice was to give . the owner time for' paying the taxes; and, in requiring weekly insertions., to afford him a better opportunity .of seeing' the advertisement of sale. \u2022</p>\n<p data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b625-8\">\"These sales are nowhere regarded with favor, but are everywhere tested by the strictest rules. They are penal, lead to for-, feiture of estate, and whatever is prescribed to give them validity must, and ought to be, observed, and has always been required. 4 Wheat. 77'; 6 Wheat. 119; 6 Peters, 328; .9 Hew. 248.-</p>\n<p data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b625-9\">It is idle for the officer or collector of the corporation to be speculating and refining in this way. Why- not give' the legal notice ? Where is the inconvenience in giving three- or four days\u2019 more notice, or waiting a few days longer for the taxes ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b625-10\">\u2018 They will not be lost by the avoidance of the sale. The corporation has the power to re-assess- the taxes on the same property. Act of 1824, \u00a7\u2019. 3.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b625-11\">Mr. Justice W A YNE</author>\n<p id=\"AF7\">delivered the opinion of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-12\">This is an ejectment -suit for part of lot No. 4, in square, No. 730, in- tile city of Washington.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-13\">The only question raised by counsel in the' argument of the case here, is, whether, where property ha\u00e9 been assessed for taxes, it can be considered- as having been regularly advertised <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>and regnlarly sold, if it shall be sold before twelve full weeks (or eighty-four days) have passed from the date of the first advertisement. Eighty-four days advertisement were not given when the property in dispute in this ease was sold. Upon the trial in the Circuit Court, the plaintiff in that court prayed its instruction to the jury in these words: <em>\u201c </em>That the said-sale wa? invalid and of no effect, and passed no title to the defendant in the premises in question; because a period of twelve full weeks had not intervened between the 26th of August, the time of the first advertised notice of sale, and the 15th of November, 1848, the day or time of sale, but a period of eleven weeks and four days only.\u201d The court gave the instruction accordingly. The defendant\u2019s counsel excepted to the same. The court, upon his prayer, allowed it, and the^case is regularly here by writ of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-5\">It appears that the notice for sale of the property in dispute was inserted in the National Intelligencer twelve times in successive weeks, the first insertion being on Saturday, the 26th of August, and the last on the 15th of November, the day of sale. Including the 26th of August as one of the day's of the notice, and the 15th of November necessarily\u2019 as another, we find that the notice was given only for eighty-two days. The language of the statute regulating the notice to be given is in these words: \u201c That public notice of the time and place of the. sale of all real property for taxes due the corporation of the city of Washington, shall be given hereafter, by advertisement, inserted in some newspaper published in said city, once in each week, for at least twelve successive weeks.\u201d Now, the first week following the date of the advertisement expired with the next Friday, the tenth of November, and, if the computation is carried out, it will be found that the twelfth week expired on the 17th of November. But the sale was made two days before, on the 15th of November, the last insertion of the notice being on the day of sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-6\">So there were eleven insertions of the notice in the newspaper in different weeks (making, with the first, twelve) after the expiration of the week from the first insertion, and the point to be settled is, whether the statute means that twelve insertions in successive weeks is sufficient notice, without respect to the number of days in twelve weeks. We do not doubt if the statute had been <em>\u201c </em>once in each week for twelve successive weeks,\u201d a previous notice of the particular day of sale haVing been given to the owner of the property, that it might very well be concluded, that twelve notices in different successive weeks, though the last insertion of the notice for sale was on the day \u00f3f sale, was sufficient. But when the legislator has used the words, for at least twelve successive weeks, we cannot doubt that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>\u2022words, at least as they would do in common parlance, mean a duration of the time that there is in twelve successive Weeks or eighty-four days. Every statute must be construed from the words in it, and that construction is to be preferred which gives to all of them an operative meaning. Our construction of the statute under review gives to every word its meaning. The other leaves out of consideration the words \u201c for at least,\u201d which mean a space of time comprehended within twelve successive weeks or eighty-four days. The preposition, for, means of itself duration when it is put in connection with time, and as all of us use it in that way, in our every-day conversation, it cannot be presumed that the legislator, in malting this statute, did not mean to use it in the same way. Twelve successive weeks is as definite a designation of .time, according to our division bf it, as can be made. When we say that any thing may be done-in twelve weeks, or that it shall not be done for twelve weeks, after the happening of a fact which is to precede it, we mean that it may be done in twelve weeks or eighty-four days, or, as the ease may be, that it shall not be done before. The notice for sale, in this instance, was the fact which was to precede the time for sale, and that is neither qualified nor in any way less-3ned by the words <em>\u201c </em>once a week,\u201d which precede in this statute those which follow them, <em>\u201c </em>for at least twelve successive weeks.\u201d We think that the court did not err in refusing to give to the jury the instruction which was asked by the defendant' upon the trial of this case.-</p>\n<p id=\"b627-5\">The construction of the statute will be recognized to be in harmony with that policy of the law which experience ha,s established to protect the ownerships of property torn divestiture by statutory sales, where there has not been a substantial compliance with the law, by which a public officer is empowered to sell it.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-6\">Property is liable to be sold on account of an undischarged obligation of the owner of it to the public or to his creditors. But it can only be done in either case where there has been a substantial compliance with the prerequisites of the sale, as those are fixed by law. Any assumption by the officer appointed to make the sale, or disregard of them, the law discountenances. He may not do any thing of himself, \u00e1nd must do all as he is directed by the law under which he acts. He may hot, by any misconstruction of it, anticipate the time for sale within which the owner of the property may prevent a sale of it, by paying the demand against him, and the expenses which may have been incurred from his not having done so before. This the law always presumes that the. owner may do, until a sale has been made. He may arrest the uplifted hammer of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>the auetioneer-when the cry for sale is made, if it be done before a <em>bond fide </em>bid has been made. The authority of the officer to sell is, as it was in this case, \u201c unless the taxes be previously paid to the collector, with such expenses as may have accrued at the time of payment.\u201d There is a difference, it is true, in the strictness required in a tax sale, and that of a sale made under judgment and-execution, but in both, the same rule applies hs to the full notice of time which the law requires to be given for the sale. \u201c In deciding upon tax land titles great strictness has always been observed. The collector\u2019s proceedings are closely scanned. The purchaser is bound to inquire whether he has done so or not. He buys at his peril, and cannot sustain his title\" without showing the authority of the collector and the regularity of his proceedings.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b628-5\">This court said, in Williams <em>v. </em>Peyton, 4 Wheat. 77, that the authority given to - a collector to sell land for the non-payment of the direct tax, \u201c is a naked power not coupled with an interest.\u201d In all such, cases the law requires that every prerequisite to the exercise of that power must precede its exercise, that the agent must pursue the power or his act will not be sustained by it. Again, in Ronkendorff\u2019s Case, 4 Peters, 349, this court repeated that in an <em>ex parte </em>proceeding, as a sale of lands for taxes, under' a special -authority, great strictness is required. An individual cannot be divested of his property against his consent, until every substantial-requisite of the law has been complied with. The proof of the regularity of the collector\u2019s proceedings devolves upon the person who claims under the collector\u2019s sale. At an earlier day, the court decided, in Stead\u2019s Executors <em>v. </em>Course, 4 Cranch, 403: A collector selling lands for taxes, must act in conformity with the law from which his power is derived; and the purchaser is bound to inquire whether he has so acted. , It is incumbent upon the vendee to prove the authority to sell. See also McClung <em>v. </em>Ross, 5 Wheaton, 116; Thatcher <em>v. </em>Powell, 6 Wheaton, 119. The decisions made by this court are full as to the circumstances under which tax titles may be set aside.' We recommend also the perusal of the case of Lyon et al. <em>v. </em>Burt et al., in 11 Alabarda Reports, cited by the counsel for the defendant in error; and to all of the cases cited in the opinion of Chief Justice Collier. It is not necessary for us to extend this opinion farther in citing eases upon tax sales. So far as we know, the l\u00e1w upon the- subject is the same throughout the United States, and where differences exist they have occurred from a different phraseology in statutes, and not from any ^discordance in the views of judges in respect to the common law to be applied in tax sales.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-6\">See 4 Cranch, 403; 9 Cranch, 64,\u2022 1 Scam. 335 ;\u25a0 1 Bibb, 295; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>5 Mass.
