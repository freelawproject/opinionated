The appellants claimed that Gates <em>&amp; </em>Brown were their factors for the sale of sugar, and that at the time Gates <em>&amp; </em>Brown made their deed to Boudar, trustee, there was certain sugar on hand, nf which the trustee had taken possession, and accounts due for sugar sold, all of which was the property of appellants and not of Gates &amp; Brown, and they filed their petition setting up their claim and asking to have the sugar on - hand or its proceeds delivered to them, and also the amounts collected by the trustee for sugar sold to other parties. The Chancery Court, being of opinion that Gates &amp; Brown were purchasers of the sugar and not mere factors of the appellants, dismissed their petition, and they appealed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b856-6\"><em>Wyndham R.

If the provisions of the agreement under construction did not constitute the transaction a sale, it would be difficult to imagine what would be necessary to do so. Bor a discussion of their character and effect, reference is made to the opinion this day delivered in the case of <em>Arbuclde </em>v. <em>Gates &amp; Brown, ante p. </em>802.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-10\">The decree appealed from must be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-11\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
