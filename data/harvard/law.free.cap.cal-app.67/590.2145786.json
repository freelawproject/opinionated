(Rule XXVI, subd. 4.) Nor has petitioner seen fit to file any reply to the Commission\u2019s answer, though the time therefor has elapsed, and the answer purports to supply much of the evidence which was omitted by petitioner in its application. We therefore feel justified in assuming that all of the material evidence bearing upon the point raised by petitioner is set forth in the Commission\u2019s answer. The evidence so set forth in the answer unquestionably is sufficient to warrant the conclusion of the Commission, and the writ, therefore, is denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
