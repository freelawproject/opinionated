Appellants argue that the trial court erred by applying the doctrine of res judicata and denying their\n   Civ.R. 56(F) motion for an extension of time to file a brief in opposition to Artistic's motion for summary judgment. After a thorough review of the record and law, this court affirms.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Factual and Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 2} In 2013, appellants purchased a home in Independence, Ohio. They intended to substantially remodel the home before moving in. Appellants enlisted Artistic as the general contractor to complete the construction and remodeling work. The parties entered into a home construction/remodeling contract on January 28, 2014. A dispute arose regarding Artistic's work on the project.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    A. The First Lawsuit\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 3} As a result of the dispute regarding Artistic's construction/remodeling work, appellants filed a complaint against Artistic and Sue Perrin on October 3, 2014, in Cuyahoga C.P. No. CV-14-833782. Appellants asserted causes of actions for breach of contract, violations of the Ohio Consumer Sales Practices Act, fraud, unjust enrichment, alter ego, and negligence. On December 31, 2014, Artistic filed an answer and counterclaims against appellants for breach of contract and quantum meruit, seeking to recover for work completed on the project that appellants had not compensated Artistic for.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 4} Despite the fact that Artistic counterclaimed for breach of contract and quantum meruit, appellants dismissed their complaint pursuant to Civ.R. 41(A)(1)(a) on January 12, 2016. A bench trial commenced on Artistic's counterclaims on January 20, 2016. At the close of trial, the trial court issued findings of fact and conclusions of law on March 25, 2016. The trial court concluded that Artistic failed to substantially complete the project within a reasonable time period, and thus, was not entitled to contractual damages. The trial court held that Artistic was entitled to an award in quantum meruit/unjust enrichment based on the reasonable value of the work it performed on appellants' property. The trial court awarded Artistic $18,462.95.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 5} On April 25, 2016, appellants filed an appeal challenging the trial court's judgment.\n   <em>\n    Shawn Grill v. Artistic Renovations of Ohio L.L.C.,\n   </em>\n   8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 104383. On May 3, 2016, appellants voluntarily dismissed the appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    B. The Second Lawsuit\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   {\u00b6 6} On December 8, 2016, in Cuyahoga C.P. No. CV-16-872875, appellants filed a complaint against Artistic, All Seasons Appraisals L.L.C. (\"All Seasons\"), and Huntington Bank (\"Huntington\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Appellants asserted causes of action against Artistic and Perrin for breach of contract, breach of warranty, violations of the Ohio Consumer Protection Act, fraud in the inducement, fraud in the performance, negligent misrepresentation, and unjust enrichment. Appellants asserted causes of action against All Seasons for breach of contract and negligence. Appellants asserted causes of action against Huntington for breach of contract and respondeat superior.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   {\u00b6 7} On February 17, 2017, Artistic filed an answer and a counterclaim alleging that appellants engaged in frivolous conduct pursuant to R.C. 2323.51(A)(2). On the same date, Artistic filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings, arguing that appellants' claims were barred by res judicata. On March 7, 2017, the trial court converted Artistic's motion for judgment on the pleadings to a motion for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   {\u00b6 8} Appellants filed a response to Artistic's counterclaim on March 13, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Artistic supplemented its motion for summary judgment on April 3, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   {\u00b6 9} On April 26, 2017, appellants filed a motion for an extension of time to respond to Artistic's motion for summary judgment. Artistic opposed the motion for an extension of time on April 28, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   {\u00b6 10} On May 1, 2017, the trial court denied appellants' motion for an extension of time to respond to Artistic's motion for summary judgment. The trial court ordered appellants to file their brief in opposition to Artistic's motion for summary judgment on or before May 3, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   {\u00b6 11} On May 3, 2017, appellants filed a brief in opposition to Artistic's motion for summary judgment and a motion for an extension of time pursuant to Civ.R. 56(F). On May 11, 2017, Artistic filed a reply brief in support of its motion for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   {\u00b6 12} On May 13, 2017, the trial court granted Artistic's motion for summary judgment, concluding that appellants' claims against Artistic were barred by the doctrine of res judicata. It is from this judgment that appellants filed the instant appeal on June 9, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   {\u00b6 13} Appellants assign two errors for review:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   I. The trial court committed reversible error when it granted [Artistic's] motion for summary judgment on grounds of res judicata as the instant case alleges new claims against new parties from those set forth in [CV-14-833782], and is based on evidence discovered after the filing of [CV-14-833782].\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   II. The trial court committed reversible error when it denied appellants' Rule 56(F) request for an extension of time to complete discovery and supplement its brief in opposition to [Artistic's] motion for summary judgment as [appellants] were [not] reasonably able to complete needed discovery prior to their deadline to file its brief in opposition despite due diligence.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

However, in Counts 4 and 6 of the original complaint, appellants alleged that some of Artistic's work failed to comply with the city's building code.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Complaint at \u00b6 12, 45, 55.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   {\u00b6 25} Second, appellants assert that after they filed the first complaint on October 3, 2014, they learned that Artistic had not paid several subcontractors. Specifically, appellants contend that they learned Artistic had not paid Toss, Inc., G &amp; D Eurostone, Inc., Yes Electric, Inc., and Compass Insulation. Appellants claim that they did not learn that Artistic was defrauding subcontractors and retaining all of the money until after the bench trial in the first lawsuit. The record reflects, however, that appellants were aware that Artistic had not paid subcontractors when they filed the first complaint. In Count 2 of the original complaint, appellants alleged that Artistic failed to inform First Merit Bank that they had not paid subcontractors. Complaint at \u00b6 30;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 14 (alleging that Artistic failed to \"pay employees and subcontractors although [Artistic] had been paid in full for the work completed.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   {\u00b6 26} Third, appellants assert that they did not discover some evidence of Artistic's fraud until the bench trial in the first lawsuit. Appellants claim that Artistic's owner, Ken Perrin, admitted that (1) he artificially inflated the value of homes that Artistic works on as a general contractor, and (2) he goes directly to the bank to make payment draw requests, which is contrary to the terms of the escrow agreement\n   with First Merit Bank. In Count 2 of the first complaint, however, appellants alleged that Artistic materially understated or misstated the cost of completing the contract. Complaint at \u00b6 32.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   {\u00b6 27} Under the second\n   <em>\n    Rettig\n   </em>\n   prong, we find that the appellants' claims arose out of the transaction or occurrence-the construction/remodeling contract-that was the subject matter of Artistic's counterclaims for breach of contract and quantum meruit in the first lawsuit. The basis for each cause of action asserted by appellants in their second complaint arose from the construction/remodeling agreement and the homeowner-general contractor relationship that existed between appellants and Artistic. Appellants' claims against Artistic in the second complaint bear a logical relationship to the claims appellants asserted against Artistic in the first complaint and Artistic's counterclaims for breach of contract and quantum meruit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   {\u00b6 28} Because the claims that appellants asserted against Artistic in the second complaint satisfy both prongs of the\n   <em>\n    Rettig\n   </em>\n   two-part test, they were compulsory counterclaims that either were or should have been asserted in the first lawsuit. Appellants either asserted and then abandoned their claims against Artistic in the first lawsuit or should have but failed to assert their claims against Artistic in the first complaint. Thus, appellants were barred from asserting these claims in the second lawsuit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   {\u00b6 29} Appellants' argument that res judicata does not apply because the parties in the first and second lawsuits are different is misplaced. As noted above, appellants asserted claims against All Seasons and Huntington in their second complaint. All Seasons and Huntington were not parties in the first lawsuit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   {\u00b6 30} The trial court only dismissed the claims that appellants asserted against Artistic in Counts 1 through 7 of the second complaint. The trial court did not dismiss the claims that appellants asserted against All Seasons and Huntington in Counts 8 through 11 of the second complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   {\u00b6 31} Based on the foregoing analysis, we find that the trial court properly concluded that appellants were barred from asserting the claims against Artistic in their second complaint. Accordingly, appellants' first assignment of error is overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   <strong>\n    C.

In order to grant a Civ.R. 56(F) motion, the trial court must be convinced that there is a likelihood of discovering some such facts.\n   <em>\n    Penix\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 32.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   {\u00b6 34} In the instant matter, appellants argue that the trial court abused its discretion in denying their Civ.R. 56(F) motion. In support of their argument, appellants contend that they discovered \"considerable evidence of wrongdoing\" by Artistic, All Seasons, and Huntington after filing the first complaint in October 2014, and that they had very limited time to conduct discovery and respond to Artistic's motion for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   {\u00b6 35} After reviewing the record, we cannot say that the trial court abused its discretion in denying appellants' Civ.R. 56(F) motion for an extension of time. We initially note that the same judge presided over both lawsuits and was aware of the discovery exchanged in both cases. Thus, the trial court was in the best position to determine whether an extension and/or additional discovery was necessary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   {\u00b6 36} As noted above, Artistic filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings on February 17, 2017. Appellants filed a motion for an extension of time to respond to Artistic's motion on February 23, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   {\u00b6 37} On March 7, 2017, the trial court converted Artistic's motion for judgment on the pleadings to a motion for summary judgment, denied appellants' motion for an extension of time to respond to Artistic's motion for judgment on the pleadings, and set forth the following schedule for briefing in its journal entry:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-68\">\n   [Artistic] may supplement their motion for summary judgment on or before 04/03/2017. [Appellants] may filed a brief in opposition to [Artistic] on or before 05/03/2017. [Artistic] may file a reply in support of their motion for summary judgment within 10 days of service of [appellants'] brief in opposition. [Appellants'] motion for extension of time to respond to [Artistic's] motion for judgment on the pleadings, filed 02/23/2017, is denied as moot. Discovery is ongoing. The court will not consider any discovery motions unless and until the parties\n   make a sincere effort to resolve the dispute and, if not resolved, contact the court via conference call to discuss the disputed issues. The court shall set a scheduling conference to set further deadlines after ruling on [Artistic's] motion for summary judgment.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   {\u00b6 38} On April 26, 2017, appellants filed another motion for an extension of time to respond to Artistic's motion for summary judgment. Therein, appellants argued that they had not been able to complete the discovery they needed to \"fully and completely\" respond to Artistic's motion for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   {\u00b6 39} Artistic opposed appellants' motion for an extension of time on April 28, 2017. Therein, Artistic argued that appellants' request for another extension of time was \"harassing, draining, and wholly unnecessary.\" Artistic emphasized that res judicata is a purely legal issue, and thus, appellants did not need to conduct further discovery in order to respond to the summary judgment motion. Finally, Artistic asserted that appellants were not entitled to conduct further discovery regarding issues or claims that could have or should have been brought in the first case because these claims are barred by res judicata.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   {\u00b6 40} On May 1, 2017, the trial court denied appellants' motion for an extension of time to respond to Artistic's motion for summary judgment and ordered appellants to file its brief in opposition on or before May 3, 2017. The trial court's order was consistent with the schedule that the trial court established on March 7, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   {\u00b6 41} On May 3, 2017, two days after the trial court denied appellants' second motion for an extension of time, appellants filed a brief in opposition to Artistic's summary judgment motion and requested a third extension of time pursuant to Civ.R. 56(F). Appellants requested an extension of time \"to conduct discovery so [they] can supplement [their brief in opposition to Artistic's summary judgment motion].\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   {\u00b6 42} The record reflects that appellants had nearly two months-from March 7, 2017, when the trial court converted Artistic's motion for judgment on the pleadings to a motion for summary judgment, until May 3, 2017-to respond to Artistic's summary judgment motion. Furthermore, appellants' Civ.R. 56(F) motion for an extension of time was the second request appellants made to conduct further discovery after the trial court explicitly stated that it would not address any further discovery motions unless the parties made a sincere effort to resolve the dispute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   {\u00b6 43} Based on the foregoing analysis, we cannot say that the trial court's denial of appellants' request for an extension of time was unreasonable, arbitrary, or unconscionable. Appellants' second assignment of error is overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   <strong>\n    III. Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   {\u00b6 44} After thoroughly reviewing the record, we affirm the trial court's judgment. The claims that appellants asserted against Artistic in their second complaint were compulsory counterclaims that should have been asserted in the first lawsuit. Because appellants dismissed or failed to present these claims in the first lawsuit, they were barred by the doctrine of res judicata from asserting these claims against Artistic in the second lawsuit. Furthermore, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying appellants' Civ.R. 56(F) motion for an extension of time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   {\u00b6 45} Judgment affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   ANITA LASTER MAYS, P.J., and KATHLEEN ANN KEOUGH, J., CONCUR\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-81\">\n    All Seasons and Huntington are not parties to the instant appeal.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
