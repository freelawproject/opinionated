Plaintiff-appellee is the state of Ohio.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 2} In August 2016, Detective Steve Minich of the Alliance Police Department arrested Aaron Hall for trafficking in heroin, a felony of the fifth degree. Hall had sold heroin to two people who subsequently overdosed. Those individuals told Minich Hall had sold them the heroin, and Hall told Minich appellant was his supplier. Minich asked Hall if he would be willing to perform three controlled buys from appellant in exchange for dropping the trafficking charge and Hall agreed. At the time, appellant, who Hall knew only as \"Trap,\" lived in Canton.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 3} Minich went forward with the plan assisted by Alliance officers Hiles and Rajcan. The first buy took place on September 6, 2016. First, Hall and his vehicle were searched to make certain he did not possess any contraband. He was then\n   equipped with an audio and video digital transmitter and recorder so that officers could hear Hall, see things from his point of view during the transaction, and also video record the transaction. Hall was then directed to contact appellant at the phone number he normally used to contact him. Hall sent a text to appellant and asked \"Hey bro, can I grab a half,\" which means may I purchase $75 worth of heroin. Appellant texted back \"yea.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 4} Hall was provided with $75 in previously photocopied currency. Officers then began following Hall to appellant's residence on 9th Street N.E in Canton. Partway there, however, appellant called Hall and told him to go to 1620 22nd St. N.E. in Canton instead. This was the residence of appellant's girlfriend's family. Hall proceeded to that address. Appellant came out of the house and Hall made the buy. There were children playing 20-30 feet away from the men during the transaction. Minich was able to see the transaction and the children. Hall then drove back to the Alliance Police Department with officers following. Once there, officers took possession of the heroin and searched Hall and his vehicle again. The heroin field tested positive for heroin and was sent to the Canton-Stark County Crime Lab where this testing was later confirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 5} The following day, a second controlled buy was made, this time in concert with the Canton Police Department. Officers from both departments met Hall at the Walmart on Harmon and Route 62. The same protocol was followed equipping Hall with audio and video recording devices, cash, and searching Hall as well as his vehicle. Hall texted appellant and asked if he could \"grab a 50,\" which is about half a gram of heroin. Howard responded \"yea I'm on 9th.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 6} Hall started towards 9th Street with officers following, but once again, halfway there appellant contacted Hall and told him to go to the 22nd Street address. Hall did so and completed the transaction. When appellant came outside with the heroin to meet Hall, there were two children playing in the front yard 15 to 20 feet away.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 7} Following the transaction, Hall and the officers went to the Alliance Police Department where officers took possession of the heroin and searched Hall and his vehicle. The heroin again field tested positive, a finding later confirmed by the crime lab.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 8} The final buy took place on September 12, 2016. The same procedures were followed. This time, however, the purchase was made at appellant's residence at 1009 9th Street, and Hall went inside the residence to make the buy. Appellant's 8 year-old son stood next to appellant as cash and drugs changed hands.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 9} Based on these transactions, Canton Police Detective Mike McKay obtained search warrants for both the 9th Street N.E and 22nd Street N.E addresses. Canton officers executed the warrants and Alliance officers provided security. No drugs or evidence of drug trafficking were found at the 22nd Street address.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {\u00b6 10} At the 9th Street address, officers were met by appellant's mother and stepfather. They were cooperative and stated appellant was staying in the basement. Meanwhile, additional officers had appellant under surveillance. He was stopped while driving toward the 22nd street address with his girlfriend and children. Appellant was arrested, brought to the 9th Street address and seated in the living room with his mother and stepfather. When appellant arrived, Canton officers had already begun the search of the 9th Street home.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   {\u00b6 11} While that was going on, Officer McKay of the Canton Police Department was in the basement searching appellant's bedroom, McKay heard appellant come into the residence yelling profanities and failing to follow police orders. Appellant asked to speak to McKay. Once appellant calmed down, McKay and Officer Penvose took him into another room, turned on an audio recorder and read appellant his\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   warnings. Appellant then told McKay he wanted to help officers with illegal drug activity in the area and asked McKay to contact a third agency. McKay had assumed appellant wanted to talk about the search and the items found by officers. He considered the conversation unproductive and did not feel appellant was being sincere. He therefore terminated the conversation and turned off the recorder. As soon as he did, appellant said \"McKay, you know I sell that shit and I fuck with the hos. You know, you know.\" Once returned to the living room, appellant also stated \"last time you guys got me with a gram; this time you got me by the balls cuz of 31 grams.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   {\u00b6 12} The search of the 9th Street home yielded evidence of drug trafficking, drug possession.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   {\u00b6 13} In the basement, three bags of heroin totaling 33.77 grams was found in one of appellant's shoes, and .05 grams of morphine was located on top of a speaker. Mail addressed to appellant was found on top of a nightstand. Two cell phones and a digital scale with cocaine residue on it were also found. There were children's toys, bedding, and clothing scattered throughout the basement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   {\u00b6 14} Upstairs in the kitchen, officers found ammunition and plastic tear-off bags used for packaging drugs. Later testing identified traces of heroin on one of the tear-off bags. Suboxone strips, used by people with heroin addiction, were found in the pocket of a jacket in the living room. Officers also seized the cell phone appellant had on his person, the same one on which appellant received texts from Hall.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   {\u00b6 15} Numerous text messages were taken from the phone indicative of drug trafficking. Additionally, one message from \"O'Burn\" asked where appellant lived. Appellant responded \"my mom's on 9th st. 9th st. n. Gibbs down the street from Church's Chicken.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   {\u00b6 16} As a result of these events, in case 2016CR1756, based on the search of his residence, appellant was charged with one count of trafficking in heroin in the vicinity of a juvenile, a felony of the first degree, one count of possession of heroin, a felony of the second degree, and for the morphine, one count of aggravated possession of drugs, a felony of the fourth degree. In case number 2016CR1803, based on the controlled buys, appellant was charged with three counts of trafficking in heroin in the vicinity of a juvenile, felonies of the fourth degree. On September 23, 2016, appellant pled not guilty at arraignment and was released on $100,000 bond pending trial. On October 25, 2016, appellant failed to appear for a pretrial and a capias was issued for his arrest. The capias was served on November 18, 2016. Circumstances arising out of the fact that appellant absconded led to additional charges and a third case-case number 2016CR2191.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   {\u00b6 17} In January, 2017, the state moved for joinder of all three cases and appellant filed a motion to sever. Appellant's motion argued each case should be tried separately, or in the alternative, the first two cases, 2016CR1756 and 2016CR1803, should be tried together and 2016CR2191 tried separately.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   {\u00b6 18} After a hearing on the matter, the trial court found no prejudice in trying\n   all three cases together, however for procedural reasons, ruled 2016CR1756 and 2016CR1803 would be tried together and 2016CR2191 at a later date.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   {\u00b6 19} Cases 2016CR1756 and 2016CR1803 proceeded to a jury trial on January 24, 2017. At the conclusion of the trial, appellant was found guilty of one count of trafficking in heroin in the vicinity of a juvenile, a felony of the first degree, one count of possession of heroin, a felony of the second degree, and three counts of aggravated trafficking in the vicinity of a juvenile, felonies of the fourth degree. Appellant was acquitted of aggravated possession of drugs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   {\u00b6 20} The trial court sentenced appellant on January 30, 2017. The court first merged the first degree felony trafficking in heroin and the second degree felony possession of heroin and imposed maximum consecutive sentences as follows: trafficking in heroin, a felony of the first degree, 11 years; three counts of trafficking in heroin, felonies of the fourth degree, 18 months on each count. The trial court ordered Howard to serve each sentence consecutively for an aggregate total of 15.5 years incarceration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   {\u00b6 21} Appellant subsequently filed an appeal, and the matter is now before this court for consideration. He raises 6 assignments of error:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   {\u00b6 22} \"THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN DENYING APPELLANT'S MOTION FOR SEPARATE TRIALS.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   {\u00b6 23} \"THE APPELLANT WAS DENIED HIS RIGHT TO FAIR TRIAL DUE TO PROSECUTORIAL MISCONDUCT.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   III\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   {\u00b6 24} \"THE APPELLANT WAS DENIED HIS RIGHT TO EFFECTIVE ASSISTANCE OF COUNSEL.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   IV\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   {\u00b6 25} \"THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN ADMITTING APPELLANT'S STATEMENTS WHICH WERE PROTECTED BY ATTORNEY-CLIENT PRIVILEGE.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   V\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   {\u00b6 26} \"THE TRIAL COURT ABUSED ITS DISCRETION BY IMPOSING MAXIMUM AND CONSECUTIVE SENTENCES.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   VI\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   {\u00b6 27} \"THE TRIAL COURT'S FINDING OF GUILTY WAS AGAINST THE MANIFEST WEIGHT OF THE EVIDENCE AND WAS NOT SUPPORTED BY SUFFICIENT EVIDENCE.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   {\u00b6 28} In his first assignment of error, appellant argues he was prejudiced by the joinder of case numbers 2016CR1756 and case number 2016CR1803. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   {\u00b6 29} Pursuant to Crim.R. 13, \"[t]he court may order two or more indictments or informations or both to be tried together, if the offenses or the defendants could have been joined in a single indictment or information.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   {\u00b6 30} Crim.R. 8(A) governs joinder of offenses and states the following:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   Two or more offenses may be charged in the same indictment, information or complaint in a separate count for each offense if the offenses charged, whether felonies or misdemeanors or both, are of the same or similar character, or are\n   based on the same act or transaction, or are based on two or more acts or transactions connected together or constituting parts of a common scheme or plan, or are part of a course of criminal conduct.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   {\u00b6 31} Crim.R. 14 governs relief from prejudicial joinder and states the following:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   If it appears that a defendant or the state is prejudiced by a joinder of offenses or of defendants in an indictment, information, or complaint, or by such joinder for trial together of indictments, informations or complaints, the court shall order an election or separate trial of counts, grant a severance of defendants, or provide such other relief as justice requires. In ruling on a motion by a defendant for severance, the court shall order the prosecuting attorney to deliver to the court for inspection pursuant to Rule 16(B)(1) any statements or confessions made by the defendants which the state intends to introduce in evidence at the trial.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   {\u00b6 32} The standard of review on this issue is set forth in\n   <em>\n    State v.

Lott\n   </em>\n   , 51 Ohio St.3d at 163, 555 N.E.2d at 298. The first is the \"other acts\" test, where the state can argue that it could have introduced evidence of one offense in the trial of the other, severed offense under the \"other acts\" portion of Evid.R. 404(B).\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ; see, also,\n   <em>\n    Bradley v.

The second is the \"joinder\" test, where the state is merely required to show that evidence of each of the crimes joined at trial is simple and direct.\n   <em>\n    State v. Lott\n   </em>\n   , supra ;\n   <em>\n    State v. Roberts\n   </em>\n   (1980),\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1804382\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-st-2d/62/170/#p175\">\n    62 Ohio St.2d 170\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 175,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=16%20Ohio%20Op.%203d%20201\">\n    16 O.O.3d 201\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 204,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=405%20N.E.2d%20247\">\n    405 N.E.2d 247\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 251 ;\n   <em>\n    State v.

If the state can meet the joinder test, it need not meet the stricter \"other acts\" test. Thus, an accused is not prejudiced by joinder when simple and direct evidence exists, regardless of the admissibility of evidence of other crimes under Evid.R. 404(B).\n   <em>\n    State v. Lott\n   </em>\n   , supra ;\n   <em>\n    State v. Roberts\n   </em>\n   , supra ;\n   <em>\n    State v. Torres\n   </em>\n   , supra.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   {\u00b6 34} First, as noted by the state, appellant did not properly preserve this issue for review. Although appellant filed a pretrial motion to sever, he failed to renew his motion at any point during trial, thereby waiving any previous objection to joinder of these offenses. \"If the defendant files a motion to sever, but ultimately fails to renew the objection at the close of either the state's case or presentation of all evidence, he waives the joinder issue on appeal.\"\n   <em>\n    State v. Cobb\n   </em>\n   , 12th Dist. App. No. CA2007-06-153,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2008-Ohio-5210\">\n    2008-Ohio-5210\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2008%20WL%204456995\">\n    2008 WL 4456995\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , fn 6 citing\n   <em>\n    State v.

Case number 2016CR1803 involved the three trafficking charges that resulted from the controlled buys conducted by Alliance Police Department. Case number 2016CR1756 involved charges stemming from the search warrant executed by the Canton Police Department at appellant's residence as a result of the controlled buys. These cases were part of the same course of criminal conduct. Further, the evidence of each matter was simple and direct and the jury's verdict reflects that fact. The jury was able to discern the separate crimes and was not biased by the presentation of evidence on multiple counts as demonstrated by the fact that it acquitted appellant of aggravated possession of drugs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   {\u00b6 36} Appellant has therefore not meet his burden to establish prejudice. Accordingly, the first assignment of error is overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   {\u00b6 37} In his second assignment of error, appellant argues he was denied a fair trial due to prosecutorial misconduct. Specifically, appellant argues the prosecutor improperly asked Detective McKay to testify as to appellant's veracity, violated the trial court's motion in limine by allowing the jury to hear that mail found in appellant's bedroom was from the probation department, improperly introduced ammunition and a crack pipe discovered during the search, and by misstating in closing argument which officers were present to hear appellant's statement \"last time you guys got me with a gram, this time you got me by the balls cuz of 31 grams.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   {\u00b6 38} The test for prosecutorial misconduct is whether the prosecutor's comments and remarks were improper and if so, whether those comments and remarks prejudicially affected the substantial rights of the accused.\n   <em>\n    State v.

Further, the sentence imposed shall be \"commensurate with and not demeaning to the seriousness of the offender's conduct and its impact upon the victim, and consistent with sentences imposed for similar crimes by similar offenders.\" R.C. 2929.11(B).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   {\u00b6 67} R.C. 2929.12 sets forth the seriousness and recidivism factors for the sentencing court to consider in determining the most effective way to comply with the purposes and principles of sentencing set forth in R.C. 2929.11. The statute provides a non-exhaustive list of factors a trial court must consider when determining the seriousness of the offense and the likelihood that the offender will commit future offenses. Appellant does not argue the trial court failed to make findings where required, rather, he argues the sentences are disproportionate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   {\u00b6 68} Under R.C. 2929.12(B), among the various factors that the trial court must consider and balance to determine if the offender's conduct is more serious is that the offender committed the offense for hire or as a part of an organized criminal activity, which is clearly the case here. Under this same section, the trial court could consider any other relevant factors as well. The trial court noted appellant trafficked heroin in the presence of his children and further, continued to sell heroin even when he knew people were overdosing on what he was providing. Transcript of sentencing 19-20.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   {\u00b6 69} Under R.C. 2929.12(C), the trial court is also to consider any factors that render the offender's conduct less serious. None of the factors listed in R.C. 2929.12(C) apply in this matter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   {\u00b6 70} Under R.C. 2929.12(D) the trial court is to consider all of the listed factors that apply to the offender, and any other relevant factors, as factors indicating that the offender is likely to commit future crimes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   {\u00b6 71} Three of the five factors apply here. First, \"[a]t the time of committing the offense, appellant was under release from confinement before trial or sentencing; was under a sanction imposed pursuant to section 2929.16, 2929.17, or 2929.18 of the Revised Code ; was under post-release control pursuant to section 2967.28 or any other provision of the Revised Code for an earlier offense * * *.\" Appellant was on both parole and intensive supervision probation at the time he committed these offenses. Transcript of sentencing 5, 20. Next, appellant has a history of criminal convictions. Transcript of sentencing 18-19. Third, appellant has not responded favorably to sanctions previously imposed by criminal convictions. Transcript of sentencing 19-20.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   {\u00b6 72} Finally, R.C. 2929.12(E) lists factors the trial court is to consider to determine is the offender is less likely to commit future crimes. None of the listed factors apply here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   {\u00b6 73} The record supports the trial court's imposition of maximum sentences. Appellant is more likely to recidivate, and his conduct was more serious.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   Consecutive Sentences\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   {\u00b6 74} Appellant also challenges the consecutive nature of his sentences. Again, he does not argue that the trial court failed to make the appropriate findings. Instead, he argues consecutive sentences are inappropriate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   {\u00b6 75} When discretionary consecutive sentences are imposed, R.C. 2929.14(C)(4) requires the following:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-133\">\n   (4) If multiple prison terms are imposed on an offender for convictions of multiple offenses, the court may require the offender to serve the prison terms consecutively if the court finds that the consecutive service is necessary to protect the public from future crime or to punish the offender and that consecutive sentences are not disproportionate to the seriousness of the offender's conduct and to the danger the offender poses to the public, and if the court also finds any of the following:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-134\">\n   (a) The offender committed one or more of the multiple offenses while the offender was awaiting trial or sentencing, was under a sanction imposed pursuant to section 2929.16, 2929.17, or 2929.18 of the Revised Code, or was under post-release control for a prior offense.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-135\">\n   (b) At least two of the multiple offenses were committed as part of one or more courses of conduct, and the harm caused by two or more of the multiple offenses so committed was so great or unusual that no single prison term for any of the offenses committed as part of any of the courses of conduct adequately reflects the seriousness of the offender's conduct.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-136\">\n   (c) The offender's history of criminal conduct demonstrates that consecutive sentences are necessary to protect the public from future crime by the offender.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   {\u00b6 76} In\n   <em>\n    State v. Bonnell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4283371\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-st-3d/140/209/\">\n    140 Ohio St.3d 209\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2014-Ohio-3177\">\n    2014-Ohio-3177\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=16%20N.E.3d%20659\">\n    16 N.E.3d 659\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , syllabus, the Supreme Court of Ohio held: \"In order to impose consecutive terms of imprisonment, a trial court is required to make the findings mandated by R.C. 2929.14(C)(4) at the sentencing hearing and incorporate its findings into its sentencing entry, but it has no obligation to state reasons to support its findings.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   {\u00b6 77} Here, during the sentencing hearing the trial court found appellant had a lengthy criminal record, was on judicial release when he committed these crimes, as well as on intensive supervision probation and house arrest. The trial court further noted appellant trafficked and possessed heroin in the presence of his children, and was apparently indifferent to the impact of heroin on its victims and the community. T. 17-23. The appropriate findings were further made in the court's sentencing judgment entry. The record therefore shows that the trial court considered the required factors set forth in R.C. 2929.14(C)(4) in imposing consecutive sentences.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-139\">\n   {\u00b6 78} Indeed, appellant appears to agree that the trial court uttered the appropriate \"magic words\" to impose consecutive sentences. Appellant's brief at 16. \"Where a trial court properly makes the findings mandated by R.C. 2929.14(C)(4), an appellate court may not reverse the trial court's imposition of consecutive sentences unless it first clearly and convincingly finds that the record does not support the trial court's findings.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

Accordingly, appellant's fifth assignment of error is overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-142\">\n   VI\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-143\">\n   {\u00b6 81} In his final assignment of error, appellant argues his convictions are against the manifest weight and sufficiency of the evidence.

To prove the charge, it was necessary for the state to produce evidence to show that in the vicinity of a juvenile, appellant prepared for shipment, shipped, transported, delivered, prepared for distribution, or distributed heroin and that the amount of heroin was at least 10 grams, but was less than 50 grams.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-147\">\n   {\u00b6 84} Appellant was also convicted of possession of heroin, a felony of the second degree, in violation of R.C. 2925.11(A)(C)(d). To prove this charge, the state had to produce evidence to show appellant knowingly obtained, possessed, or used heroin, and that the amount of heroin was at least 10 grams, but was less than 50 grams.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-148\">\n   {\u00b6 85} Finally, appellant was convicted of three counts of trafficking in heroin in the vicinity of a juvenile, in violation of R.C. 2925.03(A)(1)(C)(6)(b). To prove the charge, the state needed to produce evidence to show appellant knowingly sold, or offered to sell heroin, and that he did so in the vicinity of a juvenile.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-149\">\n   The Evidence\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-150\">\n   {\u00b6 86} Hall made three controlled buys from appellant while wearing video and audio recording equipment. T. 227, 233. The jury viewed each video. Hall testified children were present during each buy. During one buy Detective Minich testified he was able to observe the exchange cash for drugs as well as the presence of children. T. 237-238.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-151\">\n   {\u00b6 87} Following the buys, officers executed a search warrant at appellant's mother's home where appellant was staying in the basement. In one of appellant's shoes, officers found 33 grams of heroin. Officers also discovered two scales, and tear-off baggies used for packaging drugs, one of which tested positive for heroin. Appellant further made two incriminating statements during the search. First he stated had just purchased 35 grams of heroin, that it was located in his basement bedroom, and that he would tell officers\n   who he purchased it from. T. 269-270. Second appellant told that McKay \"you know I sell that shit * * *.\" T. 382.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-152\">\n   Appellant's Arguments\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-153\">\n   {\u00b6 88} Appellant questions the credibility of Hall, suggests others who could potentially be to blame for possession of the heroin, scales, and tear-off baggies, and states he was found not guilty of possessing the Suboxone strips that were also located in the home.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-154\">\n   {\u00b6 89} First, appellant was not charged with possessing Suboxone. Second, the jury heard and rejected appellant's alternative arguments as to who could be responsible for the heroin and drug trafficking implements. Credibility determinations, however, are the sole province of the jury. Given the overwhelming evidence of appellant's guilt in the form of three videotaped buys and appellant's own admissions, we cannot say the jury lost its way in making its credibility determinations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-155\">\n   {\u00b6 90} The state presented ample evidence to support appellant's convictions and the jury did not lose its way in so convicting appellant. The final assignment of error is overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-156\">\n   Delaney, P.J. and Baldwin, J. concur.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
