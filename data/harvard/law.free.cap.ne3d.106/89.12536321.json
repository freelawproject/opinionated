Appellant assigns the following error for review:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-10\">\n   \"THE PROBATE COURT ERRED IN DENYING THE SOLE HEIR TO THE SUBJECT ESTATE THE RIGHT TO PURCHASE THE REAL PROPERTY AT THE FULL ESTIMATED VALUE SET FORTH IN THE SCHEDULE OF ASSETS.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 2} This appeal arises out of a decedent's estate administration. Karla S. Mayberry, plaintiff below and appellee herein, is the decedent's sister and administrator of the estate. The trial court declared appellant the decedent's surviving spouse. The decedent's family and appellant initially agreed to the disposition of the decedent's estate, but relations soured. Appellee subsequently filed a complaint under R.C. Chapter 2127 that requested the trial court to authorize a sale of the decedent's real estate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 3} On April 11, 2017, the trial court granted appellee the authority to sell the real estate \"free of the claims, interest, liens, and rights therein of all persons to this action.\" The court additionally authorized appellee to employ a real estate broker to assist in the sale of the property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 4} On July 13, 2017, appellant filed a \"Motion to Compel Notice of Sale Proceedings to Surviving Spouse.\" Appellant requested the court to compel appellee \"to give [appellant] notice and an opportunity to participate in all decisions regarding the sale of the subject property before the sale, including execution of the listing agreement and the hiring of a listing agent.\" She further asserted that permitting her to purchase the real estate would be in the estate's best interest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 5} On July 19, 2017, the trial court granted appellant's motion. The court ordered appellee to provide appellant \"notice and give her an opportunity to participate in all decisions regarding the sale of the subject property before the sale, including, but not limited to, execution of the listing agreement and the hiring of a listing agent.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 6} The next day, appellee filed a memorandum in opposition to appellant's motion to compel. Appellee asserted that she had already obtained a real estate agent and listed the property and that requiring her to obtain appellant's consent and advice regarding every decision concerning the sale of the real estate would serve only to frustrate and delay the sale process. She thus asked the court to deny appellant's motion to the extent that appellant requested that she be allowed to participate in decisions regarding the sale of the property. Appellee further requested the court to disallow appellant the right to purchase the real estate for the value stated on the inventory.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 7} The trial court granted appellee's motion and found that appellant \"is entitled to notice only\" and that appellee \"is not compelled or required to obtain consent or allow [appellant's] participation.\" The court additionally determined that appellee \"is not compelled or required to sell the real property to [appellant] at the value stated on the Inventory.\" This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 8} On August 25, 2017, this court noted that the trial court's decision regarding appellant's motion to compel may not constitute a final, appealable order. We therefore directed appellant to file a memorandum to address our jurisdiction to hear the appeal. We subsequently determined that we have jurisdiction to hear the appeal and concluded that appellant \"may have a substantial right to purchase and/or elect the property in question pursuant to the relevant statutory authority\" and that the probate court \"found that [appellant does] not have such a right.\" We found that disallowing the appeal would deprive appellant of any meaningful ability to enforce\n   her right. We explained that appellant's \"right-if it exists-may be foreclosed by the sale of the home to a third party.\" We thus concluded that the court's decision regarding appellant's motion to compel constitutes a final, appealable order. However, after further reflection and review of the probate court file, we find it necessary to clarify our prior conclusion that the trial court's decision regarding appellant's motion to compel constitutes a final, appealable order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {\u00b6 9} It is well-established that courts of appeals have jurisdiction to \"affirm, modify, or reverse judgments or final orders of the courts of record inferior to the court of appeals within the district.\" Section 3(B)(2), Article IV, Ohio Constitution. \"As a result, '* * * an order [or judgment] must be final before it can be reviewed by an appellate court.

The court additionally granted appellee's request that the court find that appellee need not sell the decedent's real estate to appellant. The court's July 20, 2017 decision, therefore, clearly limits or restricts appellant's right to purchase the decedent's real estate. The effect of the court's\n   July 20 decision is to prevent appellant from purchasing the decedent's interest in the mansion house. If appellant is unable to appeal the trial court's decision, she possesses no other legal avenue to pursue her statutory right to purchase the decedent's interest in the mansion house.

The court's decision does not address R.C. 2106.10(A) at all and does not deny appellant effective future relief and foreclose all future opportunities to seek relief pursuant to R.C. 2106.10(A). In fact, on August 17, 2017, appellant filed an application under R.C. 2106.10(A) to elect to receive the decedent's interest in the mansion house. The record does not indicate whether the trial\n   court has ruled on her application.

Consequently, the trial court's July 20, 2017 decision does not deprive appellant of her substantial right to elect to receive the decedent's interest in the mansion house.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The trial court has not entered a final order regarding appellant's rights under R.C. 2106.10. We therefore do not have jurisdiction to consider appellant's appeal as it relates to R.C. 2106.10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   {\u00b6 19} With our jurisdiction to consider this appeal clarified, we turn to consider whether the probate court erred by failing to find that R.C. 2106.16(A) gives appellant the right to purchase the decedent's interest in the mansion house. The statute reads, in part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   The application or petition provided for in this section shall not be filed prior to filing the inventory required by section 2115.02 of the Revised Code or later than one month after the approval of that inventory. Failure to file an application or petition within that time nullifies the election with respect to the property required to be included, and the real or personal property then shall be free of the right granted in this section.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   {\u00b6 20} In the case sub judice, appellant does not dispute that she failed to file her petition to purchase the mansion house within one month after the probate court approved the inventory. Instead, she contends that her failure to do so resulted from not being recognized as the decedent's surviving spouse until February 2016-well after the court approved the inventory. R.C. 2106.16, however, does not provide for any exception to the one-month time limit.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Frinkley v. Meeker\n   </em>\n   , 11th Dist. Portage No. 2004-P-0022,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2004-Ohio-6696\">\n    2004-Ohio-6696\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2004%20WL%202860402\">\n    2004 WL 2860402\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 12 (noting that statute expressly states that \"[f]ailure to file the application within [one-month] deadline nullifies the election of the property\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   {\u00b6 21} We readily admit, nonetheless, that appellant's situation appears to be a novel one not within the contemplation of the legislature when it last amended the statute in 1995. Nevertheless, even if we could read an exception into the statute so as to permit a surviving spouse, who the court did not recognize as such until more than one month after the court approved the inventory, to file an R.C. 2106.16 petition later than one month after the court approved the inventory, we think that any such exception would allow the surviving spouse to file the petition within one month, or some other reasonable time, after the court recognized the individual as the surviving spouse.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   {\u00b6 22} In the case at bar, in February 2016 the probate court recognized appellant as the surviving spouse. Appellant\n   filed her R.C. 2106.16 petition in May 2017. Thus, appellant's petition clearly falls outside the one month time limit set forth in the statute. Additionally, even if an exception existed for appellant's situation, appellant did not file her petition within one month after the court recognized her as the surviving spouse. Instead, appellant waited approximately fifteen months before filing the petition. A fifteen-month delay seems beyond reasonable. Thus, even if we could read an exception into the statute, appellant's conduct would not meet that exception.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   {\u00b6 23} Appellant additionally attempts to argue that her delay in filing the petition is excusable due to the parties' settlement negotiations that later proved fruitless. Again, however, the statute does not provide for an exception when parties are engaged in settlement negotiations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   {\u00b6 24} Consequently, we believe that the facts establish that appellant did not file her R.C. 2106.16(A) petition within one month after the court approved the inventory, and that no exceptions exist to allow for the fifteen-month delay. Therefore, we do not believe that the trial court erred by denying appellant's motion to compel and by entering an order preventing her from purchasing the decedent's interest in the mansion house.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   {\u00b6 25} Accordingly, based upon the foregoing reasons, we overrule appellant's sole assignment of error and affirm the trial court's July 20, 2017 judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   JUDGMENT AFFIRMED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Hoover, P.J.: Concurs in Judgment &amp; Opinion\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Harsha, J.: Concurs in Judgment &amp; Opinion except for Footnote 1\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-48\">\n    We observe that on April 11, 2017, the trial court granted appellee judgment on her complaint to sell the real estate and issued an order of sale. Appellant did not attempt to appeal this decision.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-49\">\n    We additionally point out that on May 2, 2017, appellant filed an R.C. 2106.16(A) petition to purchase the decedent's interest in the mansion house. The next day, the court rejected it as untimely. Appellant did not appeal this decision, and she has not referred to this decision on appeal. Rather, appellant asserts that the trial court has not yet ruled on her petition.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-50\">\n    At least one court has compared a probate court's decision that grants an order of sale under R.C.

Prac. Merrick-Rippner Prob. L., Section 92:32 (\"A judgment granting the complaint [filed under R.C.

Moreover, a probate court's decision that denies a surviving spouse's petition to purchase the decedent's interest in the mansion house appears to meet the requirements of R.C. 2505.02(B)(2).
