Duncan appeals the March 23, 2017 Judgment Entry entered by the Licking County Municipal Court, which denied his motion to dismiss. Plaintiff-appellee is the state of Ohio.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   STATEMENT OF THE FACTS AND CASE\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 2} On March 13, 2012, Appellant was arrested and subsequently charged with operating a motor vehicle while intoxicated, in violation of R.C. 4511.19 ; driving under suspension-license forfeiture, in violation of R.C. 4510.111 ; and a tail light and illumination of rear license plate offense, in violation of R.C. 4513.05, in Licking County Municipal Court Case No. 12 TRC 2817 (\"Case No. 12 TRC 2817\"). Appellant appeared for arraignment on March 20, 2012, and entered a plea of not guilty to the charge. The trial court scheduled a bench trial for April 17, 2012. On April 5, 2012, Appellant executed an Affidavit of Indigency and filed a motion requesting the appointment of counsel. The trial court granted Appellant's request and appointed Attorney Adrienne Larimer on April 9, 2012.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 3} On April 12, 2012, Appellant filed a demand for discovery, a request for a bill of particulars, and a jury demand. Thereafter, on April 16, 2012, Appellant filed a motion requesting a continuance of the bench trial. The trial court granted the continuance, and scheduled a final pre-trial for June 1, 2012, and a bench trial on June 4, 2012. On May 15, 2012, the state filed a motion to continue due to the unavailability of the prosecutor. The trial court granted the continuance, and scheduled a jury trial for June 18, 2012.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 4} The state responded to Appellant's request for discovery on June 7, 2012. On June 15, 2017, the state filed a motion to dismiss after realizing the citation failed to include a punishable offense due to a scrivener's error. The trial court granted the motion, and dismissed the case on June 18, 2012.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 5} After an agreement with Appellant's counsel, the state filed a new citation, correctly citing Appellant with OVI, in violation of R.C. 4511.19(A)(1)(a), in Licking Municipal Court Case No. 12 TRC 7283 (\"Case No. 12 TRC 7283\"). Appellant requested a continuance of his June 27, 2012 arraignment. Appellant failed to appear on the rescheduled arraignment date of July 11, 2012. The trial court issued a bench warrant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 6} Appellant appeared before the trial court over four years later on August\n   12, 2016, and entered a plea of not guilty. The trial court scheduled the matter for trial on October 17, 2016. Appellant filed a demand for discovery and a motion to continue on October 5, 2016. Appellant filed a waiver of his right to a speedy trial on the same date. The trial court scheduled the matter for November 17, 2016. On October 24, 2016, the state filed a response to Appellant's discovery and a reciprocal demand for discovery. The trial court continued the trial until January 5, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 7} Upon Appellant's motion, the trial court again continued the trial and indicated it would reschedule the matter for a change of plea hearing and sentencing at a future date. On February 10, 2017, Appellant filed a motion for work release. Appellant filed a motion to dismiss on speedy trial grounds on March 1, 2017, which the trial court denied via Judgment Entry filed March 23, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 8} The trial court granted Appellant's request for work release on April 19, 2017. On the same day, the trial court scheduled a change of plea hearing for May 3, 2017. Appellant filed a motion for continuance on May 8, 2017. On June 9, 2017, Appellant appeared before the trial court and changed his original plea of not guilty to a plea of no contest. The trial court accepted Appellant's plea, found him guilty, and sentenced him to 180 days in jail with 170 days suspended. The trial court also suspended Appellant's driver's license for 2 years. Appellant requested a stay of sentence pending his appeal of the March 23, 2017 Judgment Entry. The trial court granted the request and stayed Appellant's sentence pending this Court's disposition of the instant appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 9} It is from the March 23, 2017 Judgment Entry Appellant appeals, raising as his sole assignment of error:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   I.

Appellant argues the state should not \"benefit\" from the tolling of the speedy trial time as it took the state 56 days to respond to his demand for discovery, and the delay was prejudicial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   {\u00b6 21} Appellant further maintains the trial court erred in determining only 54 days counted against his speedy trial time in Case No 12 TRC 7283, which represented the number of days between August 12, 2016, the date on which he appeared for arraignment, and October 5, 2016, the date on which he filed a demand for discovery, a motion for continuance of trial, and a waiver of his speedy trial rights. The trial court concluded a total of 80 days of his speedy trial time had elapsed. Appellant asserts, once he filed his motion to dismiss on March 1, 2017, his speedy trial waiver was revoked, and his speedy trial time should have begun to run again. Alternatively, his speedy trial time should have begun to run again once the trial court denied his motion to dismiss on March 23, 2017. Appellant adds the trial court took no action on the matter from March 23, 2017, until April 19, 2017, when it scheduled a plea hearing for May 3, 2017, and those 27 days should be counted against the speedy trial time, for a total of 107 days.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   {\u00b6 22} In order to provide a clear analysis, we will examine the relevant time periods separately.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   {\u00b6 23} The first period is that between Appellant's March 13, 2012 arrest on the original OVI charge and the trial court's June 18, 2012 Entry, dismissing the same without prejudice. The trial court found 26 days attributable to the state in Case No. 12 TRC 2817, apply to the speedy trial calculation in Case No. 12 TRC 7283. At oral arguments in this matter, Appellant agreed with the trial court's determination only 26 days of speedy trial time had accrued against the state.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   {\u00b6 24} The next time period encompasses August 12, 2016, the date on which Appellant was arraigned in Case No. 12 TRC 7283, through October 5, 2016, the date on which Appellant filed a demand for discovery, a motion for continuance, and a waiver of his right to a speedy trial. We find the trial court properly found this period counted against the state, and accurately charged the state with 54 days for speedy trial purposes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   {\u00b6 25} Time was tolled from October 5, 2016, until March 1, 2017, when Appellant filed his motion to dismiss based upon Appellant's waiver of his speedy trial right. Upon the filing of the motion to dismiss, Appellant's October 5, 2016 speedy trial waiver was revoked.\n   <em>\n    State v. Battle\n   </em>\n   , 5th Dist.

However, despite the revocation of his time waiver, Appellant's speedy trial time continued to toll. The filing of Appellant's motion to dismiss tolled the speedy trial period from March 1, 2017, until March 23, 2017, the date on which the trial court denied the motion. See,\n   <em>\n    State v. Szorady,\n   </em>\n   9th Dist.

In its March 23, 2017 Judgment Entry, the trial court noted, \"This case shall be set for an oral hearing for the purpose of a change of plea and imposition of sentence on a date and time to be set.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4, unpaginated. As of that date, we agree with the trial court 80 days were chargeable against the state. On April 19, 2017, the trial court issued an order scheduling a change of plea hearing on May 3, 2017. Appellant asserts the 27 days between March 23, 2017, and April 19, 2017, should be charged against the state, which would exceed the 90 days in which the state was required to bring him to trial. We find the delay of less than 30 days after Appellant's revocation of his time waiver was not unreasonable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   {\u00b6 28} In its Brief to this Court, the state cites\n   <em>\n    State v.
