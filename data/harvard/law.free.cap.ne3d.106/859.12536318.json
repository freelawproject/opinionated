The trial court imposed an aggregate, nine-year term of imprisonment-the firearm specifications being imposed consecutive to the other and the underlying concurrent term on all other sentences. We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 2} In July 1995, Curry and an accomplice, both wearing masks to hide their identities, robbed two male and two female victims at gunpoint in the backyard of the home of one of the victims. At trial, the victims testified that several were deprived of their property, but in the original police report, the investigating police officer only noted that one of the victims had property stolen during the robbery.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 3} The two female victims were forcibly removed to secluded areas on the property and were raped. Each assailant marched one of the female victims to a different area-one was taken to a bedroom inside the house and the other behind the garage. The male victims were left lying prostrate in the backyard, and they fled the scene when the assailants took the female victims. One victim, taken into the bedroom, was vaginally penetrated but refused to perform oral sex on the assailant. That assailant then met up with Curry, who had just finished raping the other female victim behind the garage. The second assailant then forced the second victim to perform oral sex on him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 4} Curry and his accomplice fled the scene. Police were immediately called, and both women were taken to the hospital where evidence was preserved. In 2013, a test was conducted in the attempt to match the DNA, but only one of the samples collected was tested-the vaginal swab from the victim who was sexually assaulted by both Curry and his accomplice behind the garage. Curry could not be excluded as the assailant. The oral swab from that same victim was not retested. Curry testified at trial and claimed that he had consensual intercourse with the victim at his birthday party days before the attack.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The victim testified to never having met Curry.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 5} Curry was indicted, and a summons was issued on the last day of the 20-year statute of limitations.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Following a jury trial, Curry was found guilty of all charges. This timely appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 6} In the first assignment of error, Curry claims the state failed to return the indictment under Crim.R. 6(F) in order to timely commence the prosecution under R.C. 2901.13(F), which provides that a prosecution is commenced on the date the indictment is returned, on the date a lawful\n   arrest without warrant is made, or on the date that a warrant, summons, citation, or other process is issued.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 7} An indictment is returned under Crim.R. 6(F) if\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   (1) the indictment is found upon the concurrence of seven or more grand jurors; (2) the foreman or deputy foreman signs the indictment; (3) the indictment is returned to the judge of the common pleas court who is supervising the grand jury; and (4) the indictment is filed with the clerk of courts, who shall endorse thereon the date of filing and enter the case on the appearance and trial dockets.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <em>\n    State v.

Curry argues that the state failed to demonstrate that the indictment was presented to the judge of the common pleas court who was supervising the grand jury, and therefore, the indictment was not \"returned\" by July 1, 2015. We need not address this argument because a summons was timely issued under R.C. 2901.13(F), and thus commencement in this case is dependent on the summons, not the return of the indictment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {\u00b6 8} Curry contends that the summons was not issued until a day after the statute of limitations ran, when the capias was issued. R.C. 2901.13(F) distinguishes between the summons and the warrant for arrest. An action is commenced by issuing either process; the statute does not require both.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=573%20N.E.2d%20113\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

According to the notation on the appearance docket, the clerk of courts timely issued the summons before the expiration of the statute of limitations and a warrant was issued the following day. The prosecution was timely commenced under R.C. 2901.13(F), and the first assignment of error is overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   {\u00b6 9} In the second assignment of error, Curry contends that the indictment should have been dismissed based on preindictment delay.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   {\u00b6 10} It is a due process violation under the United States and Ohio Constitutions to cause an unjustifiable delay between the commission of an offense and a defendant's indictment if the delay results in actual prejudice.\n   <em>\n    State v.

This lost or missing evidence demonstrated actual prejudice because, according to Curry, the state claimed that he was the assailant who forced the victim to the bedroom, and therefore, the state's theory might have been proven false by the DNA evidence contained in the untested samples relating to the identity of that assailant. The foundation of Curry's argument is perplexing. The theory that Curry forced one victim to the bedroom and raped the other on his way out was not advanced by the state or even supported by the DNA evidence produced at trial-the only evidence tying Curry to the crimes. Curry could not be excluded as the source of the DNA obtained from the vaginal swab of the victim who was raped behind the garage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   {\u00b6 13} The missing evidence has no bearing on the evidence of Curry's guilt, which was entirely premised on Curry being identified as the attacker of the victim behind the garage.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Adams\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4043391\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-st-3d/144/429/\">\n    144 Ohio St.3d 429\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015-Ohio-3954\">\n    2015-Ohio-3954\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=45%20N.E.3d%20127\">\n    45 N.E.3d 127\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at \u00b6 106 (missing evidence of alibi, allegedly placing defendant in another location at the time of death, was irrelevant based on the evidence at trial). Under the state's theory, and based on the evidence presented at trial, it would be expected that Curry would be excluded as the source of the DNA in the untested samples-those samples would have revealed the accomplice's identity.

In reviewing a sufficiency challenge, \"[t]he relevant inquiry is whether, after viewing the evidence in a light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime proven beyond a reasonable doubt.\"\n   <em>\n    State v. Jenks\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1708870\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-st-3d/61/259/\">\n    61 Ohio St.3d 259\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=574%20N.E.2d%20492\">\n    574 N.E.2d 492\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1991), paragraph two of the syllabus. The appellate inquiry under the current circumstances focuses on the sufficiency of the state's evidence on each element to support the convictions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   {\u00b6 21} Curry claims that his identity was not sufficiently proven, that there is no evidence of an actual theft as it pertains to three of the four victims in support of the four aggravated robbery charges, and that he cannot be convicted of complicity in the rape of the other victim. None of those claims have merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   {\u00b6 22} Curry's identity was sufficiently established through the DNA evidence. His explanation for the DNA evidence boils down to his credibility and the weight of the evidence. Thus, his sufficiency of the evidence argument is essentially one challenging the weight of the evidence, which is overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   {\u00b6 23} With respect to the aggravated robbery counts, Curry claims that an offender must actually commit a theft offense against each victim, otherwise there is insufficient evidence supporting the aggravated robbery charge. R.C. 2911.01(A)(1) provides that no person, either by attempting or committing a theft offense, shall have, possess, or control a deadly weapon that is brandished. An offender need only attempt to commit a theft offense. Actual theft of property is not an element. R.C. 2911.01(A)(1). In addition,\n   the victims testified to losing property during the robbery. Although the police report differs from their trial testimony, their credibility is not a consideration with regard to the sufficiency of the state's evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   {\u00b6 24} Finally with respect to the sufficiency of the evidence, Curry offers no legal authority in support of his claim that he cannot be found guilty of complicity in the rapes committed by his accomplice as required under App.R. 16(A)(7). It is not this court's responsibility to provide support for an appellant's argument. The fourth assignment of error is overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   {\u00b6 25} In the fifth assignment of error, Curry claims that the trial court was required to merge the kidnapping, as charged in Count 15, with the attempted rape charge, as charged in Count 6 of the indictment. The kidnapping relates to the asportation of the victim to the bedroom to facilitate the sexual assault. The state claimed Curry was a co-conspirator for the unknown accomplice's crimes. On appeal, Curry contends that because the trial court merged the kidnapping with the rape, it must also merge the kidnapping with the separate attempted rape charge. At sentencing, however, Curry expressly requested that the kidnapping be merged with either the rape or the attempted rape, but not both. Tr. 842:4-6; 847:1-12 (Curry affirmatively responded to the trial court's request for confirmation that the attempted rape charged merged with no other count if the kidnapping merged with the rape charge). The trial court merged the offenses as requested by Curry. Any error in this regard was, therefore, invited.\n   <em>\n    State v.

When asked if he had a specific recollection of an encounter with the victim, Curry claimed he had sex with \"different young ladies, young and older.\" On follow-up, Curry was asked if he could specifically remember any of the women he had sex with during the relevant time frame. He could not recall anyone. Tr. 701:11-15. In other words, Curry's claim of consensual sex with the victim is based on his belief that she must have been one of the many women he had sex with the week before the attack, but he was unable to specifically remember the victim.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-45\">\n    The amendment to R.C. 2901.13(A)(4) effective July 15, 2015, which extended the statute of limitations for violations of R.C. 2907.02 an additional five years, was not effective until after the original limitations period for Curry's conduct had expired.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
