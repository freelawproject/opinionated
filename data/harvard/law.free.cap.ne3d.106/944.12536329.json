We allowed defendant's petition for leave to appeal. For the reasons discussed below, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   \u00b6 2 BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b6 3 The appellate court opinion contains a detailed recitation of the evidence adduced at trial (\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=47%20N.E.3d%201005\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 2-172 ), and defendant does not challenge the sufficiency of such evidence. Accordingly, we provide only a summary of the events leading to defendant's arrest and prosecution and an overview of the State's evidence. Additional facts will be set forth in the analysis section as necessary for resolution of the issues raised in this appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 4 Defendant and Kathleen were married on May 3, 1992. During the marriage, the couple had two sons. The Peterson family lived in Bolingbrook, Illinois, where defendant was employed as a police officer. In early 2002, defendant and Kathleen each filed a petition for dissolution of marriage; the cases were consolidated. Kathleen was awarded temporary custody of the couple's sons and exclusive possession of the marital home. In a bifurcated dissolution proceeding, the marriage was dissolved on October 10, 2003, with child custody, child support, maintenance, and division of property to be determined at a hearing scheduled for April 6, 2004.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 5 On Sunday evening, February 29, 2004, defendant attempted to return his sons to Kathleen after the boys' weekend visitation, but Kathleen could not be reached. The following evening defendant, with the assistance of a locksmith and along with four of Kathleen's neighbors, entered Kathleen's home. Kathleen's body was discovered in the bathtub. The Illinois State Police conducted the death investigation. An autopsy performed by Dr. Bryan Mitchell with the Will County Coroner's office determined that the cause of death was drowning. A coroner's inquest later determined that the manner of death was accidental.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 6 Following Kathleen's death, a final judgment was entered in the couple's bifurcated divorce. Defendant was awarded sole custody of his two sons, and remaining financial issues were resolved in defendant's favor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 7 At the time of Kathleen's death, defendant was married to Stacy Cales. The couple, along with their infant son, lived in a home in Bolingbrook not far from Kathleen's residence. During defendant's marriage to Stacy, the couple had another child, a girl.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 8 On October 28, 2007, Stacy's sister, Cassandra Cales, reported to police that Stacy was missing. Defendant denied that Stacy was missing and told investigators that Stacy had left because they were having marital problems. Soon thereafter, Kathleen's body was exhumed. At the request of the Will County State's Attorney, a forensic pathologist, Dr. Larry Blum, performed an autopsy on November 13, 2007. Dr. Blum concluded that the manner of death was homicide. At the request of the Savio family, Dr. Michael Baden, a forensic pathologist, performed an autopsy on November 16, 2007. He, too, concluded that the manner of death was homicide.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b6 9 In May 2009, a grand jury entered a two-count indictment against defendant for the first degree murder of Kathleen. See 720 ILCS 5/9-1(a)(1), (a)(2) (West 2004). During the seven-week jury trial that began in July 2012, the State presented evidence that numerous bruises and abrasions on Kathleen's body and a laceration to her scalp were consistent with a struggle and inconsistent with an accidental fall in the bathtub. The State also presented evidence that defendant had threatened Kathleen on several occasions, stating that he could kill her and make it look like an accident and that defendant had accessed Kathleen's home after he moved out and\n   after Kathleen had changed the locks. Additionally, a witness for the prosecution testified that four months prior to her death, defendant had offered him $25,000 to help find a man to \"take care of his third wife.\" Finally, the State presented evidence that, on the night of Kathleen's death, Stacy observed defendant, who had been absent from their home overnight, dressed in black and placing women's clothes that were not hers into the washing machine and that defendant coached Stacy on what to say to police when she was interviewed following the discovery of Kathleen's body.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b6 10 The jury found defendant guilty, and the trial court subsequently sentenced defendant to 38 years' imprisonment. On direct review, the appellate court affirmed defendant's conviction and sentence.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20IL%20App%20%283d%29%20130157\">\n    2015 IL App (3d) 130157\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 229,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=400%20Ill.%20Dec.%2040\">\n    400 Ill.Dec. 40\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=47%20N.E.3d%201005\">\n    47 N.E.3d 1005\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . We allowed defendant's petition for leave to appeal. Ill. S. Ct. R. 315 (eff. Jan. 1, 2015).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b6 11 Defendant urges this court to reverse the judgment of the appellate court and remand for a new trial, arguing that (1) certain hearsay statements were improperly admitted at trial under the forfeiture by wrongdoing doctrine, (2) counsel rendered ineffective assistance when he called attorney Harry Smith as a witness at trial, (3) Smith's testimony should have been barred under the attorney-client privilege, (4) counsel was operating under a\n   <em>\n    per se\n   </em>\n   conflict of interest, (5) evidence of prior bad acts was improperly admitted at trial, and (6) cumulative error denied him a fair trial. We consider each argument in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b6 12 ANALYSIS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b6 13 I. Admission of Hearsay Statements Under the Forfeiture by Wrongdoing Doctrine\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b6 14 Defendant first argues that certain hearsay statements were improperly admitted at trial under the forfeiture by wrongdoing doctrine and that such error requires this court to reverse his conviction and remand for a new trial. The State concedes that if the hearsay statements were admitted in error, such error was not harmless.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b6 15 Resolution of defendant's argument requires this court to consider two principal issues: (1) whether, under separation of powers principles, the common-law doctrine of forfeiture by wrongdoing adopted by this court, rather than the forfeiture rule adopted by the legislature, governed the admission of the hearsay statements and (2) whether the State met its burden of proof at the pretrial forfeiture hearing for admission of the hearsay statements at trial. For a complete understanding of these issues, we first provide additional background and analysis as to how these issues arose and were treated by the courts below, as well as an overview of the relevant statute and the common-law doctrine of forfeiture by wrongdoing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b6 16 Prior to trial, the State filed a motion seeking the admission of hearsay statements made by Kathleen and Stacy. In its motion, the State identified several statements allegedly made by Kathleen to family members and others regarding threats defendant made to her in which he stated that he could kill her and make it look like an accident, she should just die, and she would not make it to the divorce settlement. The State further sought admission of a letter from Kathleen to the Will County State's Attorney's office, as well as Kathleen's handwritten statement provided to police, recounting a July 5, 2002, incident in which defendant allegedly entered Kathleen's home without permission, pinned her to the stairs for over three hours while he reviewed their history,\n   and threatened her with a knife. As to Stacy, the State generally sought admission of statements she made to others regarding defendant's conduct on the night of Kathleen's death.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00b6 17 Ordinarily, the rule against hearsay would prohibit the introduction at trial of such out-of-court statements that are offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted.\n   <em>\n    People v.

The State, however, sought admission of these statements pursuant to section 115-10.6 of the Code of Criminal Procedure of 1963 (Code), a legislatively created exception to the hearsay rule. 725 ILCS 5/115-10.6 (West 2008). The General Assembly has since repealed section 115-10.6 (see Pub. Act 99-243, \u00a7 5 (eff. Aug. 3, 2015)), but at the time defendant was tried, the statute provided as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   \"Hearsay exception for intentional murder of a witness.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   (a) A statement is not rendered inadmissible by the hearsay rule if it is offered against a party that has killed the declarant in violation of clauses (a)(1) and (a)(2) of Section 9-1 of the Criminal Code of 1961 intending to procure the unavailability of the declarant as a witness in a criminal or civil proceeding.\n   <sup>\n    [\n   </sup>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   <sup>\n    ]\n   </sup>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   (b) While intent to procure the unavailability of the witness is a necessary element for the introduction of the statements, it need not be the sole motivation behind the murder which procured the unavailability of the declarant as a witness.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   (c) The murder of the declarant may, but need not, be the subject of the trial at which the statement is being offered.

The common-law doctrine, which dates back to the seventeenth century, permits the introduction of an absent witness's statements where the defendant engaged in conduct designed to prevent the witness from testifying.\n   <em>\n    Giles v.

At the hearing, which commenced in January 2010, the trial court heard testimony from 72 witnesses and received into evidence over 200 exhibits and numerous stipulations.

According to defendant, section 115-10.6 applies only when the defendant murdered the absent witness and Illinois Rule of Evidence 804(b)(5) applies when the defendant rendered the witness unavailable through any means other than murder. The State counters that Illinois Rule of Evidence 804(b)(5) applies to\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   cases where a defendant's wrongdoing renders a witness unavailable to testify.

R. Evid. 104(a) (eff.

The State presented extensive evidence regarding the acrimonious nature of the couple's divorce. For example, testimony established that defendant was adamant that Kathleen not receive any portion of his pension from his years of service in the Bolingbrook police department. Defendant was angry that their attorneys were \"getting all [his] money,\" and he publicly stated that he would be better off if Kathleen was dead. The couple was fighting over money, as Kathleen tearfully advised her employer following a conversation with defendant in the parking lot of the office where she worked. Additionally, custody of the couple's two sons remained a contested issue. Kathleen was passionate about not relinquishing custody to defendant. Indeed, just six weeks prior to her death, when Kathleen became convinced that she might not make it to the hearing, she extracted a promise from her sister, Anna Doman, that Anna would take care of Kathleen's sons should anything happen to her.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   \u00b6 46 In short, settlement of the remaining issues in the bifurcated divorce was not a realistic possibility. Thus, no question exists that Kathleen would have testified at the April 2004 hearing, as she had at an earlier hearing. Although the trial court could not know for certain how that hearing would have proceeded or what Kathleen's testimony ultimately would have been, the trial court certainly knew that Kathleen, as a party opponent, was defendant's primary adversary. Accordingly, the inference that defendant murdered Kathleen to prevent her from testifying is much stronger in this case, where a party to the litigation is murdered, than in a case where the person murdered had only a tangential relationship to the litigation or would have been, at most, a minor witness.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   \u00b6 47 In addition to the acrimonious nature of the divorce proceedings and the certainty that Kathleen would have testified at the April 2004 hearing, the State offered other evidence relevant to defendant's intent. Jeffrey Pachter testified for the State that he and defendant became friends when they both worked at a cable company. According to Pachter, in the winter of 2003, defendant asked Pachter if he wanted to go on a \"ride along\" in his police vehicle. Pachter accepted. During the ride, defendant asked Pachter if he knew anyone that could have his \"third wife taken care of.\" Defendant explained that \"she has something on me.\" Defendant mentioned a $25,000 payment to Pachter but indicated that if Pachter found someone to do it for less, he could keep the difference. Defendant did not identify the \"something\" that Kathleen had on him, but the import of Pachter's testimony is that defendant wished to silence Kathleen.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   \u00b6 48 The State presented evidence that because Kathleen was silenced, the financial and custody issues pending at the time of her death in the divorce proceeding were ultimately resolved in defendant's favor: defendant was awarded custody of his two sons, defendant was awarded the proceeds from the sale of the marital home, and defendant was awarded the business known as Blue Lightning Corporation. Additionally, Harry Smith, Kathleen's divorce attorney, testified that had Kathleen not died, educational, medical, and other expenses for Kathleen's and defendant's two sons would have been shared by the parties. Because Kathleen died, a trust fund for the two boys was set up with the proceeds from an insurance policy on Kathleen's life. The proceeds, which exceeded $1 million, were paid to defendant as the guardian of his sons' estates.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   \u00b6 49 Defendant disputes the sufficiency of the foregoing evidence, arguing that no matter how horrific the murder of a spouse may be, the forfeiture by wrongdoing doctrine does not apply unless the defendant killed his spouse to prevent testimony. Defendant contends that the State's evidence established, at most, that Kathleen's unavailability benefited him financially and allowed him to obtain sole custody of his sons. According to defendant, the State has confused a motive for murder with the specific intent to avoid testimony. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   \u00b6 50 The State was not required to demonstrate that preventing Kathleen from testifying was defendant's sole intent when he murdered her.

Each man was allowed to testify, over defendant's objection, regarding a conversation he had with Stacy in which she implicated defendant in Kathleen's death.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   \u00b6 60 Defendant objected to Smith's testimony based on the attorney-client privilege. The trial court, however, agreed with the State that defendant lacked standing to assert the privilege, which belonged to Stacy. Because the appellate court did not address the sufficiency of the evidence at the pretrial forfeiture hearing, it did not consider the privilege issue, which the State concedes defendant raised on direct review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   \u00b6 61 Defendant now renews his objection to the admission of Smith's testimony at the pretrial hearing. Defendant argues that only the client may waive this privilege and, therefore, in the absence of a waiver by Stacy, whom defendant asserts has never been declared legally dead, Smith's testimony should have been barred. Defendant argues, in the alternative, that the privilege survives death and, in that event, Smith yet had an obligation to assert the privilege on Stacy's behalf. Finally, defendant argues that the trial court was under a duty to ensure that privileged communications are not disclosed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   \u00b6 62 Defendant's arguments all assume that an attorney-client relationship arose between Smith and Stacy. The record, however, affirmatively demonstrates that such a relationship never materialized.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   \u00b6 63 Smith testified that Stacy telephoned him a few days before her disappearance, and advised that she was seeking a divorce. Smith unequivocally told Stacy that he \"could not represent her.\" Smith believed that \"there had to be a conflict\" in light of his prior representation of Kathleen. Whether Smith's assessment of the situation was correct is irrelevant. What is relevant is that Smith made plain to Stacy that he \"could not represent her.\" Where a prospective client continues to communicate with the attorney after the attorney's refusal to act for her, she \"does not need or deserve the protection of the privilege.\" 8 John H.

Smith expressed concern, but Stacy told him defendant did not know about the cell phone she had used to call him. Smith further testified:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-85\">\n   \"At some point, I told her she needs to be careful about what she's doing. She told me she had too much expletive on him at the police department so she wasn't concerned for her safety. *** She said, could we get more money out of [defendant] if we threatened to tell the police about how he killed Kathy.

During\n   <em>\n    voir dire\n   </em>\n   to determine whether the privilege applied, Schori testified that \"no rules\" existed regarding his counseling sessions and agreed with the prosecutor that \"there were no practices or precepts or customs\" of his church to which he was bound with respect to the confidentiality of counseling sessions. The complete absence of any \"traditions\" is plainly revealed in the following exchange between the prosecutor and Schori:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-92\">\n   \"Q. In other words, there was no practice, no dictate, nothing from your church that told you what to keep confidential and what not to?

That's correct.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   \u00b6 69 Because the record fails to support the factual predicate underlying defendant's argument that the clergy privilege barred Schori's testimony, we reject defendant's argument and will consider Schori's testimony in determining whether the State met its burden of proof at the pretrial forfeiture hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   \u00b6 70 Schori testified that Stacy telephoned him on August 30, 2007, two months before her disappearance. They arranged to meet at a coffee shop the following day. Stacy was anxious, very nervous, and tense, and at times she cried during their meeting. Stacy told Schori that she was afraid of the control defendant had in her life. \"She said that she didn't believe she could ever get away from him safely.\" Stacy said she loved her children, including Kathleen's children, whom she had adopted, and would never leave without them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   \u00b6 71 Schori further testified that Stacy told him that on the night Kathleen died, she and defendant had gone to bed but that she woke up and he was not there. Stacy looked for defendant in the house and then made several unsuccessful attempts to reach him on his cell phone. Stacy relayed to Schori that she saw defendant again in the early morning hours, dressed all in black, carrying a bag. Defendant put the contents of the bag-women's clothing-into the washing machine, along with the clothes he was wearing. Stacy determined that the women's clothing was not hers. Stacy told Schori that she was very scared and that defendant coached her for hours on what to say when the police interviewed her. Stacy said that what she told police was a lie. When Schori later learned from a coworker that Stacy was missing, Schori contacted the Illinois State Police.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   \u00b6 72 In addition to the testimony from Smith and Schori, the State presented other\n   evidence at the pretrial hearing that Stacy and defendant were having serious marital issues and that Stacy was contemplating a divorce. Sharon Bychowski, Stacy's neighbor, testified that she spoke to Stacy the week before Stacy disappeared. Stacy told Bychowski that she wanted a divorce and was looking for the right place to bring her children. Stacy also told Bychowski that she had packed 10 boxes of defendant's things but he had refused to leave. Cassandra Cales, one of Stacy's sisters, similarly testified that two days before Stacy's disappearance, Stacy told her she wanted a divorce and was telling her friends that she was consulting with attorneys.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   \u00b6 73 The State also introduced evidence that defendant was aware that Stacy was seeking a divorce. Thomas Morphey, defendant's stepbrother, testified that on Saturday, October 27, 2007, the day before Stacy disappeared, defendant told him that Stacy was cheating on him, that she wanted a divorce, and that she wanted him out of the house by Wednesday. Morphey continued:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-101\">\n   \"[H]e said that *** he was due to retire in 14 working days and she was going to take everything from him.

The trial court's finding as to defendant's intent was not \"unreasonable, arbitrary, or not based on the evidence presented.\"\n   <em>\n    DeLeon\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5706168\" index=\"252\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ill-2d/227/322/#p332\">\n    227 Ill. 2d at 332\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"253\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=317%20Ill.%20Dec.%20843\">\n    317 Ill.Dec. 843\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"254\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=882%20N.E.2d%20999\">\n    882 N.E.2d 999\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   \u00b6 76 In sum, we find no error in the admission of Kathleen's and Stacy's hearsay statements at trial pursuant to the doctrine of forfeiture by wrongdoing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   \u00b6 77 II.

Our review of the record, however, reveals that it is not silent. At a hearing during trial, counsel disclosed that his strategy in calling Smith as a witness was to attack Stacy's credibility generally, as well as to undermine Schori's testimony by providing a motive for Stacy to fabricate her claim that defendant was involved in Kathleen's death. The trial record bears out this strategy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   \u00b6 82 At trial, Neil Schori testified for the State, recounting his August 30, 2007, meeting with Stacy at a coffee shop in Bolingbrook. Schori's trial testimony tracked his testimony at the pretrial forfeiture hearing. Schori testified that Stacy tearfully told him that one night she and defendant went to bed together. When Stacy awoke in the middle of the night,\n   defendant was not in the house, and she was unsuccessful in contacting him by phone. Stacy next saw defendant in the early morning hours, standing at the washing machine dressed all in black, carrying a bag. Defendant placed the clothes he was wearing, along with the contents of the bag, into the washing machine and walked away. Stacy looked inside the washing machine and saw women's clothing that did not belong to her. Afterwards, defendant worked with Stacy for hours, telling her what to say to the police when they interviewed her. Stacy told Schori that she lied to the police on defendant's behalf.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   \u00b6 83 On cross-examination, defense counsel Joseph Lopez engaged in a line of questioning designed to demonstrate that Schori did not believe Stacy when she essentially told him that defendant had killed his ex-wife, Kathleen. Lopez's questioning highlighted that Schori did nothing to prevent Stacy from returning to the residence she shared with defendant, a purported murderer; never made any follow-up calls to Stacy; did not meet with her again; and did not reach out to the Savio family or law enforcement officials, even anonymously, with the information Stacy had shared. Although Schori testified at trial that he believed Stacy, Lopez impeached him with his testimony from the pretrial hearing that it was \"possible\" that Stacy had lied to him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   \u00b6 84 During defendant's case in chief, counsel called several witnesses, one of whom was Harry Smith. Under questioning from attorney Brodsky, Smith testified about his telephone conversation with Stacy in late October 2007. Stacy told Smith that she wanted to leave the state with the children and that she had information about defendant that she thought might benefit her in that regard. More specifically, Stacy \"wanted to know if the fact [defendant] killed Kathleen\" could be used as leverage in divorce proceedings. The jury also learned that Smith had previously testified that Stacy had asked him, \"could we get more money out of [defendant] if we threatened to tell the police about how he killed Kathy,\" and that Stacy had told him \"she had so much S-H-I-T on [defendant] at the police department that he couldn't do anything to her.\" Smith conceded on direct examination that Stacy had not suggested going to the police. On cross-examination, Smith agreed that Stacy had inquired about getting more money out of defendant by threatening to tell police not only that he killed Kathleen but \"how\" he killed Kathleen. On redirect, Smith testified that he told Stacy to be careful because she could be arrested. Smith explained that he was referring not to extortion but concealment of a homicide.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   \u00b6 85 In closing argument, Lopez continued the theme that Stacy had lied about defendant's involvement in Kathleen's death simply to gain an advantage in the divorce and that Schori and Smith did not believe her. Lopez argued that Stacy knew that Kathleen's death had been investigated and was found to be an accident but that she \"twist[ed]\" it into a homicide by starting a \"campaign of lies\" to \"squeeze [defendant] out of money.\" Lopez argued that this was why Stacy did not go to the police. Lopez further argued that when it appeared to Stacy that Smith did not believe her, she came up with one \"last thing,\"\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , \"something on the Bolingbrook Police Department,\" which was part of her \"campaign of lies.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   \u00b6 86 Defendant raised his ineffectiveness claim in his posttrial motion. The trial court rejected defendant's claim, noting that the decision whether to call Smith was a \"balancing test.\" The court explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-116\">\n   \"Was it more important to show and destroy Stacy's testimony by the fact\n   she was willing to commit a felony to get at the defendant, to threaten him, to get money from him as opposed to the counter weight of the statement of how he had killed Kathy.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-117\">\n   *** I cannot say that demonstrating that Stacy was an avaricious extortionist willing to commit a felony was not in some circumstance a conceivably sound strategy.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   \u00b6 87 The appellate court also rejected defendant's ineffectiveness claim, finding that the decision to call Smith was clearly a matter of trial strategy \"as defense counsel was seeking to discredit the impression of Stacy that Schori's testimony had given to the jury.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"298\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20IL%20App%20%283d%29%20130157\">\n    2015 IL App (3d) 130157\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 224,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"299\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=400%20Ill.%20Dec.%2040\">\n    400 Ill.Dec. 40\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"300\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=47%20N.E.3d%201005\">\n    47 N.E.3d 1005\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The version of Rule 1.7 that was in effect at the time Brodsky and defendant entered into the contract with Selig Multimedia prohibited a lawyer from representing a client if such representation \"may be materially limited *** by the lawyer's\n   own interests, unless: (1) the lawyer reasonably believes the representation will not be adversely affected; and (2) the client consents after disclosure.\" Ill. R. Prof'l Conduct R. 1.7(b) (eff. Aug. 1, 1990). Rule 1.8 also prohibited an attorney from entering into any arrangement with a client \"by which the lawyer acquires an interest in publication, media, or other literary rights with respect to the subject matter of employment,\" unless the employment has been concluded. Ill. R. Prof'l Conduct R. 1.8(b) (eff.

We observe, for example, that although defense counsel's acquisition of publication rights during the course of representing defendant would have violated Rule 1.8, the media contract at issue here did not, itself, create such rights. Indeed, the contract focused primarily on generating publicity through television appearances and the print media preindictment. Thus, some uncertainty exists as to whether this type of media contract falls squarely within the prohibition of Rule 1.8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-146\">\n   \u00b6 112 We also observe that defendant's claim that counsel's entry into the contract violated Rule 1.7 is not well documented in the record. Defendant maintains that no strategic purpose existed to enter into the media contract and that Brodsky was motivated by the \"five-star hotel stays, meals, and spa treatments for him and his wife, along with cash and other benefits\" that they received in conjunction with the personal appearances. These assertions, if true, might be indicative that defense counsel's representation was \"materially limited\" by counsel's \"own interests,\" in violation of Rule 1.7. But the only citation to the record defendant provides in support of these assertions is citation to oral argument by another member of his defense team during the hearing on defendant's posttrial motion. We will not rely on factual assertions made in a party's own argument that are not otherwise established in the record. See\n   <em>\n    People v.

This rule allows the admission of bad-acts or other-crimes evidence under certain circumstances but requires the State to disclose its intent to introduce such evidence \"at a reasonable time in advance of trial, or during trial if the court excuses pretrial notice on good cause shown.\" Ill. R. Evid. 404(c) (eff. Jan. 1, 2011).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-152\">\n   \u00b6 118 The bad-acts evidence at issue here involved the testimony of Jeffrey Pachter. As discussed in part I\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , Pachter testified at the pretrial forfeiture hearing regarding a conversation with defendant in the winter of 2003, during which defendant offered him $25,000 to find someone that could have his \"third wife taken care of.\" Prior to trial, the State filed a motion to admit bad-acts or other-crimes evidence but did not reference Pachter's testimony in that motion. The State, however, included Pachter's name on its witness list that was provided to defendant on July 24, 2012.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-153\">\n   \u00b6 119 On July 31, 2012, during the State's opening statement at trial, the State told the jury that defendant had a conversation with a friend \"where he offered him $25,000.\" Before the State could go any further, defendant objected. At a side bar, defendant argued that Pachter's testimony was evidence of a prior bad act that the State had not included in its pretrial motion and Pachter's testimony was thus inadmissible. Defendant urged the court to declare a mistrial. The trial court sustained defendant's objection but would not declare a mistrial. The State completed its opening statement without further reference to defendant's conversation with Pachter, and the trial proceeded.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-154\">\n   \u00b6 120 Two days later, on August 2, 2012, the State filed a motion\n   <em>\n    in limine\n   </em>\n   to admit Pachter's testimony at trial. The State, relying on\n   <em>\n    People v.

The State argued in the alternative that even if Pachter's testimony was evidence of a prior bad act, the State had provided constructive notice to defendant. The State explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-155\">\n   \"In this case, in 2010 the People disclosed Pachter's name, statements, a summary of the substance of the testimony, and in fact, his testimony was part of the 2010 [forfeiture] hearing,\n   wherein defendant had an opportunity to cross-examine the witness. Pachter's name is on the People's trial witness list. This satisfies the notice requirement of Rule 404 ***.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-156\">\n   \u00b6 121 After briefing and argument, on August 14, 2014, the trial court ruled that testimony regarding defendant's alleged offer to pay $25,000 to have Kathleen killed was evidence of a prior bad act subject to the notice requirements of Illinois Rule of Evidence 404. The State maintained, however, that its late notice should be excused in light of its reasonable but mistaken belief that the evidence was not subject to Rule 404, as well as its provision of constructive notice to defendant of Pachter's testimony. The trial court ultimately concluded that good cause had been shown, and the court extended the deadline for providing notice to defendant to August 14, 2012. Thus, the State's August 2, 2012, notice to defendant, provided in its motion\n   <em>\n    in limine\n   </em>\n   , was timely.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-157\">\n   \u00b6 122 A week later, on August 21, 2012, after a hearing, the trial court ruled that the State could introduce Pachter's testimony at trial as evidence of defendant's intent. See Ill. R. Evid. 404(b) (eff. Jan. 1, 2011) (bad-acts evidence may be admissible \"as proof of *** intent\"). The next day, the State called Pachter as a witness at trial. Defendant did not request a continuance. On direct examination, Pachter testified that defendant asked him, during a ride along in his police vehicle, if Pachter \"could find someone to take care of his third wife.\" Defendant requested a sidebar, after which the court admonished the jury as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-158\">\n   \"Ladies and gentlemen, the following instruction is applicable to the testimony that's about to be elicited, and evidence is going to be received that the defendant has been involved in conduct other than that charged in the indictment. This evidence will be received on the issue of the defendant's intent, and it may be considered by you only for that limited purpose. It's for you to determine whether the defendant was involved in the conduct, and, if so, what weight should be given to this evidence on the issue of intent.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-159\">\n   The State completed its examination of Pachter.

Rather, defendant only challenges the trial court's decision to excuse the State's failure to provide pretrial notice under Rule 404. As to that issue, defendant first argues that the trial court's initial ruling barring the State from introducing Pachter's testimony \"reassured\" the defense that Pachter's testimony would not be admitted and that the defense was \"unprepared\" for the trial court's \"about face\" on this matter. The fact that defendant did not anticipate the trial court's ultimate ruling is not a basis for finding an abuse of discretion. Moreover, the trial court's so-called \"about face\" occurred only after the State's motion to admit Pachter's testimony had been fully briefed and argued by the parties and after the court carefully considered the applicability of Rule 404, the existence of good cause, and the general admissibility of Pachter's testimony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-166\">\n   \u00b6 127 Defendant next argues that the trial court erroneously equated the provision of \"constructive notice\" with the establishment of \"good cause\" under Rule 404. The record discloses that although the trial court considered the State's argument that it provided constructive notice to defendant of its intent to introduce bad-acts evidence through Jeffrey Pachter, the trial court did not equate the two concepts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-167\">\n   \u00b6 128 Finally, defendant argues that the trial court's ruling eviscerated the purpose of Rule 404 's pretrial notice requirement, namely, to prevent prejudice by giving the defense time to prepare its own case around the bad-acts evidence. In support, defendant cites\n   <em>\n    United States v. Skoczen\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9010672\" index=\"416\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/405/537/\">\n    405 F.3d 537\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (7th Cir. 2005). There, the federal court of appeals agreed with the defendant that the government should have provided proper pretrial notice of its intent to introduce bad-acts evidence at trial, stating that \"[t]he point of the pretrial notice is to prevent undue prejudice and surprise by giving the defendant time to meet such a defense.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9010672\" index=\"417\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/405/537/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9010672\" index=\"417\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/405/537/\">\n    at 548\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The court of appeals noted, however, that the defendant had not explained how he was prejudiced by the lack of notice and observed that the defendant \"could have asked for a continuance, but he did not.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9010672\" index=\"418\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/405/537/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The court of appeals ultimately found no reversible error in the district court's decision to admit the bad-acts evidence.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9010672\" index=\"419\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/405/537/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-168\">\n   \u00b6 129 Here, defendant suggests that he had inadequate time to prepare for Pachter's testimony. But defendant was already aware of the substance of Pachter's testimony, since Pachter had previously testified at the pretrial forfeiture hearing. Moreover, like defendant Skoczen, defendant did not ask for a continuance for\n   further preparation, and as the appellate court observed, defendant appears to have fully cross-examined Pachter about his conversation with defendant and about matters related to Pachter's credibility.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"420\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20IL%20App%20%283d%29%20130157\">\n    2015 IL App (3d) 130157\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 210,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"421\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=400%20Ill.%20Dec.%2040\">\n    400 Ill.Dec. 40\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"422\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=47%20N.E.3d%201005\">\n    47 N.E.3d 1005\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
