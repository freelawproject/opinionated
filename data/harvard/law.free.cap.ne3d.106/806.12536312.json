The surveillance was initiated because of anonymous tips about drug activity at both locations. Ultimately, METRICH conducted two controlled buys with a confidential informant. During the first buy, the seller, Terry Hardin, was dropped off at 321 West Sixth while the confidential informant waited in the parking lot at the rear of the apartment building. Hardin was observed by the officers to walk over to 329 West Sixth Street, obtain drugs and return to the parking lot. The drugs were then exchanged with the confidential informant. During the second buy on August 25, 2016, the informant purchased the drugs inside 321 West Sixth Street. Wilson's vehicle, a red Chrysler\n   Crossfire, was seen at 329 West Sixth Street on multiple occasions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 3} On August 31, 2016, law enforcement officers obtained a search warrant from a Mansfield Municipal Court judge to search 329 West Sixth Street, Mansfield, Ohio. Wilson's neighbor, Edward Johnson, who lived at 319 West Sixth Street, identified Wilson to the police as living at 329 West Sixth Street. The morning of the raid, Mr. Johnson heard a knock and went to his front door. He saw Wilson enter the 321 West Sixth Street address. He had also previously seen Wilson walking his dog outside.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 4} When police executed the search warrant at 329 West Sixth Street they found a powdery substance out in the open, which later tested positive as .03 grams of cocaine. A digital scale and plastic baggies were also found. A baggie of marijuana, weighing 28.16 grams, and a baggie of heroin weighing 10.13 grams were found in a utility closet. A pill bottle with 68 Buspirone tablets, weighing 2.57 grams, was found on a mantle. Photographs, including Wilson's were seen on the mantel. When Wilson was arrested, he stated that he lived at 329 West Sixth Street. (1T. at 261).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 5} The jury found Wilson guilty of Possession of Heroin, over ten (10) grams and less than fifty (50) grams, a felony of the second degree; Possession of Cocaine, less than five (5) grams, a felony of the fifth degree; and Possession of Buspirone, with a prior drug conviction, a felony of the fifth degree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 6} The trial court sentenced Wilson to an 8-year mandatory prison sentence on the possession of heroin charge, and twelve months each for the possession of cocaine and possession of Buspirone charges. All sentences were ordered to be served concurrently.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <em>\n    Assignments of Error\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 7} Wilson raises three assignments of error,\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 8} \"I.

Coming to the factors that I am required to weigh under Ohio Revised Code 2929.12, has factors that I am required to consider in every case in sentencing which make the conduct more serious or less serious, which make recidivism, a repeat crime, more likely or less likely. In terms of factors which make the conduct more serious, the defendant acted as a part of organized criminal drug activity in the trade. That is the factor I see more serious. I don't see any that make it less serious.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-95\">\n   In terms of recidivism, the factors that I see that make recidivism more likely is Mr. Wilson has a history of criminal convictions and including specifically a drug trafficking conviction and also possession of weapons, carrying a concealed weapon. Drugs and guns don't mix.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-96\">\n   Also, I am seeing that he satisfies the factor of not responding favorably to sanctions imposed in the past for various types of drug crimes, including drug trafficking crimes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-97\">\n   And then, finally, he shows no genuine remorse. He has not conceded at all he is remorseful about what he did.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-98\">\n   Given all of those factors and given the large quantity of heroin and the problem that it is in this community, I believe the appropriate sentence is 8 years of actual incarceration on Count 1; 12 months on each of the other counts, and they are concurrent with Count 1. So the sentence is 8 years There is a mandatory 3 years of Post Release Control.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   2T. at 82-84. Accordingly, the trial court had considered the purposes and principles of sentencing [ R.C. 2929.11 ] as well as the factors that the court must consider when determining an appropriate sentence. [ R.C. 2929.12 ]. The trial court has no obligation to state reasons to support its findings. Nor is it required to give a talismanic incantation of the words of the statute, provided that the necessary findings can be found in the record and are incorporated into the sentencing entry.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   {\u00b6 62} Wilson was sentenced for a felony of the second degree. The sentencing range for a second-degree felony is two, three, four, five, six, seven, or eight years. R.C. 2929.14(A)(2). Wilson was given a sentence of eight years, which is within the statutory range. Accordingly, the sentence is not contrary to law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   {\u00b6 63} Upon review, we find that the trial court's sentencing on the charges complies with applicable rules and sentencing statutes. The sentence was within the statutory sentencing range. Furthermore, the record reflects that the trial court considered the purposes and principles of sentencing and the seriousness and recidivism factors as required in Sections 2929.11 and 2929.12 of the Ohio Revised Code and advised Wilson regarding post release control. Upon a thorough review, we find the record clearly and convincing supports the sentence imposed by the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   {\u00b6 64} While Wilson may disagree with the weight given to these factors by the trial judge, Wilson's sentence was within the applicable statutory range for a felony of the second degree and therefore, we have no basis for concluding that it is contrary to law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   {\u00b6 65} Wilson's third assignment of error is overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   {\u00b6 66} The judgment of the Richland County Court of Common Pleas is affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   Wise, John, P.J., and Hoffman, J., concur\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
