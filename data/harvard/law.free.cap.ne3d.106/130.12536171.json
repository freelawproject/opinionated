Beranek, in relation to his counterclaim against plaintiff-appellee, Bradley A. Wynveen (\"Bradley\"). He raises one assignment of error for our review:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   Did the Trial Court abuse its discretion when it disqualified Attorney Steven Beranek from continuing to represent Joseph G. Corsaro, as Trustee of the Bradley A. Wynveen Irrevocable Trust, with regard to the counterclaim filed in the action below?\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 2} For the reasons that follow, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Procedural History and Factual Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Corsaro &amp; Associates' Prior Representations of the Wynveen Family\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   {\u00b6 3} Corsaro is the founder and senior managing partner of Corsaro &amp; Associates Co., L.P.A. and has been a practicing attorney, specializing in federal tax law, for over 30 years. One of Corsaro's clients was Dr. Richard A. Wynveen (\"Dr. Wynveen\"), who Corsaro represented in numerous matters and dealings for over 20 years. During his representations, Corsaro helped Dr. Wynveen establish the Richard A. Wynveen Revocable Trust (\"RAW\"), the Bradley A. Wynveen Irrevocable Trust\n   (\"BAW Trust\"), and the Jeffrey C. Wynveen Irrevocable Trust (\"JCW Trust\"), organize numerous business entities, and plan his estate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   {\u00b6 4} In addition to his services for Dr. Wynveen, Corsaro, as well as other members of Corsaro &amp; Associates, offered legal assistance to Bradley, providing estate planning and representation for matters concerning property owned by Bradley and the BAW Trust. Further, attorneys from Corsaro &amp; Associates helped organize, establish, and continue to maintain the Wynveen Family Foundation, preparing the foundation's tax returns. Bradley was designated as one of the trustees for the foundation and was expected to receive money from the foundation at some unspecified point in the future. Also, through August 2015, the firm provided legal services for Gainwell Limited Partnership, of which Bradley is part owner.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   {\u00b6 5} On April 1, 2013, Dr. Wynveen passed away and was survived by his two sons, Bradley and Jeffrey C. Wynveen (\"Jeffrey\"). Two and one-half months later, Jeffrey also passed away. Prior to his passing, Dr. Wynveen appointed Corsaro as trustee of the RAW, BAW, and JCW trusts. In addition, according to the terms of Dr. Wynveen's will, Corsaro was named the executor of Dr. Wynveen's estate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    B. The Current Lawsuit and Counterclaim\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   {\u00b6 6} As part of his duties as executor of Dr. Wynveen's estate, Corsaro was responsible for paying $2,000,000 of estate tax due upon Dr. Wynveen's death. To do so, Corsaro decided to convert and collect assets owned by the estate, including debts owed by Bradley personally and as a partner in Gainwell Limited Partnership. Specifically, the debts allegedly included (1) a $100,000 loan (plus interest) from Dr. Wynveen to Bradley; (2) $338,000 in estate taxes derived from loans from Dr. Wynveen's estate to Bradley for the purchase of real property; and (3) Bradley's share of debt owed to the estate by Gainwell Limited Partnership. Bradley refused to pay those debts, however, disputing that he was responsible for them. As a result, Corsaro, the trustee of the BAW Trust, used funds from the BAW Trust to pay off the debts owed to the estate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   {\u00b6 7} Subsequently, on June 15, 2016, Bradley filed a complaint in the court of common pleas, probate division, against a number of defendants, including Corsaro, who was sued individually, as executor of the estate of Richard A. Wynveen, and as trustee of both the RAW and BAW trusts. The complaint also identified the Wynveen Family Foundation as a defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   {\u00b6 8} Bradley set forth six counts in his complaint, which were related to the administration of the BAW trust, RAW trust, Richard A. Wynveen's estate, and other business interests related to those trusts. Among other relief, the complaint sought the removal of Corsaro as trustee for the RAW and BAW trusts, trust and estate accountings, disgorgement of excessive attorney fees billed by Corsaro &amp; Associates and fiduciary fees, surcharges, damages, and attorney fees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   {\u00b6 9} On September 14, 2016, Corsaro, in all of his capacities, filed an answer as well as a counterclaim against Bradley, seeking recovery of debts owed by Bradley to the BAW trust and Richard A. Wynveen's estate. Attorney Beranek, who works for Corsaro's law firm, Corsaro &amp; Associates, represented Corsaro on his counterclaim and as trustee of the BAW trust. Attorney Beranek also filed a notice of appearance on behalf of the Wynveen Family Foundation; however, Attorney Beranek later filed a motion to withdraw as counsel for the foundation. Corsaro retained separate counsel to defend himself\n   against the counts alleged in Bradley's complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   {\u00b6 10} On December 2, 2016, Bradley filed a motion to disqualify Attorney Beranek based on Corsaro &amp; Associates' prior representations of Bradley and his family members. On February 13, 2017, the probate court, without a hearing, granted Bradley's motion to disqualify Attorney Beranek. In its judgment entry granting Bradley's motion to disqualify Attorney Beranek, the probate court found that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   under the three part test for determining disqualification set forth in\n   <em>\n    Dana\n   </em>\n   , the Plaintiff has demonstrated that (1) a past attorney-client relationship exists between Plaintiff and Corsaro &amp; Associates, (2) a substantial relationship exists between the subject matter of past relationships and the current dispute and (3) Corsaro, through his representation of Plaintiff and Plaintiff's businesses acquired confidential information from the Plaintiff.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   {\u00b6 11} It is from that order that Corsaro now appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Law and Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   {\u00b6 12} In his sole assignment of error, Corsaro contends that the trial court erred in disqualifying Attorney Beranek from representing him in his counterclaim against Bradley. In support of his argument, Corsaro argues that the trial court improperly applied the three-part test for disqualification set forth in\n   <em>\n    Dana Corp. v. Blue Cross &amp; Blue Shield Mut.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10535620\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/900/882/\">\n    900 F.2d 882\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (6th Cir.1990). He specifically argues that the counterclaim and prior representations by attorneys of Corsaro &amp; Associates are not substantially related and that Attorney Beranek did not acquire confidential information concerning Bradley. In response, Bradley argues that the trial court's order disqualifying Attorney Beranek was not an abuse of its discretion because all three prongs of the\n   <em>\n    Dana\n   </em>\n   test were satisfied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   {\u00b6 13} At the outset, we note that disqualification of counsel in a civil case is a final appealable order.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ross v.

In response, the hospital moved to disqualify plaintiff's attorney, who previously worked for the hospital for over 15 years and handled medical malpractice cases filed against it. The trial court granted the motion to disqualify the plaintiff's attorney, finding that the types of claims were similar, the attorney \"must have acquired confidential information regarding [the hospital] in order to defend the hospital[,]\" and the attorney had \"knowledge of hospital policies and procedures, and procedures of staff physician rules and regulations[.]\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *6. On review, the Second District found that the trial court set forth \"very sufficient reasons for disqualifying [the] attorney\" and the attorney's conduct \"present[ed] a very definite impression of impropriety, which can only bring the reputation of the legal profession into further disrepute in the eyes of the general public.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *7 and 8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   {\u00b6 30} Here, similar to the attorney in\n   <em>\n    Stevens\n   </em>\n   , Corsaro and members of Corsaro &amp; Associates represented and consulted with members of the Wynveen family for over 20 years. During that time, Corsaro assisted Bradley with his estate planning, established numerous trusts, acted as-and is the current-trustee for some of those trusts, is the executor of Dr. Wynveen's estate of which Bradley is a beneficiary, assisted in the creation of the Wynveen Family Foundation, and advised Bradley of matters concerning Gainwell Limited Partnership. In a number of those representations, some of which remain current, Corsaro owes Bradley a fiduciary duty. Further, as pointed out by the Ohio Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    Krischbaum v.

While those matters are not necessarily identical to the matter currently before this court, they concerned Bradley's assets, which are, or at the very least, will be at issue in this matter. Further, like the court found in\n   <em>\n    Stevens\n   </em>\n   , and in light of all of Corsaro &amp; Associates' previous representations of Bradley and his family members, Attorney Beranek's continued representation of Corsaro impresses a strong sense of impropriety that will surely look questionable to the public at large.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   {\u00b6 33} Therefore, we find that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in finding that the present lawsuit is substantially related to Corsaro's prior representations, which concerned Bradley's estate planning, rights as a beneficiary, and property interests. In his counterclaim against Bradley, Corsaro seeks to recover debts owed by Bradley to the BAW Trust and Dr. Wynveen's estate. The recovery of those debts is related to Bradley's assets, of which Corsaro has substantial knowledge. The makeup of Bradley's assets and rights will undoubtedly be scrutinized while adjudicating Corsaro's counterclaim because part of the debts allegedly owed involve monies now part of Bradley's assets. Therefore, we find that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in finding that Bradley satisfied the second prong of the\n   <em>\n    Dana\n   </em>\n   test.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   <strong>\n    C.

In light of the above case law, however, we find that Corsaro's arguments are unconvincing because, based on the substantial relation between the prior representations and counterclaim, the presumption of acquired confidences applies, and it is Corsaro's burden to rebut that presumption.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   {\u00b6 38} Further, at oral argument in this case, Corsaro interestingly argued that since Bradley is suing his attorney, Corsaro is allowed to disclose the confidential information he acquired from his prior representations of Bradley to defend himself. Corsaro is correct that while Prof.Cond.R. 1.6 states that an attorney \"shall not reveal information relating to the representation of a client, including information protected by the attorney-client privilege[,]\" the rule allows the revelation of information relating to the attorney's prior representation of a client when the attorney reasonably believes it is necessary \"to establish a claim or defense on behalf of the [attorney] in a controversy between the [attorney] and the client[.]\" We agree that because Bradley is suing his former attorney, Corsaro is free to reveal confidential information to establish his counterclaim as reasonably necessary. Nevertheless, Rule 1.6's exception has no bearing on the\n   <em>\n    Dana\n   </em>\n   test, which only asks whether an attorney acquired confidential information. Here, we already found that the prior relationships\n   between Corsaro and Bradley were substantially related, Corsaro's prior representations are imputed to Attorney Beranek, and therefore, a rebuttable presumption of acquired confidences applies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   {\u00b6 39} In\n   <em>\n    Litigation Mgt.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3856899\" index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-app-3d/182/742/\">\n    182 Ohio App.3d 742\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2009-Ohio-2266\">\n    2009-Ohio-2266\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=915%20N.E.2d%20342\">\n    915 N.E.2d 342\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , we reviewed a trial court's order disqualifying the defendants' counsel.

Summit No. 15171,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1992%20WL%2015960\">\n    1992 WL 15960\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Jan. 29, 1992), the plaintiff filed an action disputing the validity of a trust and hired an attorney, who previously handled the title for his property and prepared an escrow letter regarding that property. During that prior representation, the attorney knew that the plaintiff's property was to be placed in a trust, but he did not handle or organize the trust. In light of this information, the defendants moved to disqualify the plaintiff's attorney. The trial court granted the defendants' motion on the presumption that the plaintiff's attorney \"\n   <em>\n    could have\n   </em>\n   obtained financial and other information concerning his former client.\" (Emphasis added.)\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *3. The Ninth District disagreed, finding that the defendants failed to \"supply the trial court with any facts to establish that [the] former representation was adverse\" to the plaintiff's attorney's current representation.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *3. The court stated that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-82\">\n   [i]n fact, the evidence before the trial court demonstrates that [the attorney's] former representation of [the defendants] was merely ministerial, rather than adversary in nature. According to [the attorney's affidavit], his representation was limited to acquisition of title to the property and preparation of an escrow letter. [The attorney] did not handle any financing of the property, and he had no discussions with the [defendants] concerning the trust, its formation, or any of its terms.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   As a result, the Ninth District reversed the trial court's order disqualifying the plaintiff's attorney.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   {\u00b6 41} Like\n   <em>\n    Litigation Mgt.\n   </em>\n   , Bradley has established that the prior matters are substantially related and, therefore, that the presumption of shared confidences applies. Unlike\n   <em>\n    Rosenblum,\n   </em>\n   Corsaro's and Attorney Beranek's previous representations concerning Wynveen's interests were more than ministerial and allowed him to actually obtain a great deal of information related to Bradley's finances and assets. Corsaro has not sufficiently rebutted that presumption through evidence of a screen within Corsaro &amp; Associates or other sufficient proof. In fact, Corsaro instead argues that the confidential information he acquired is irrelevant because it would not be used against Bradley in furtherance of Corsaro's counterclaim. But that is not what the third prong of the\n   <em>\n    Dana\n   </em>\n   test examines, and even if that information is not used to establish liability under the counterclaim, it will surely be used in execution of judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   {\u00b6 42} We find that the trial court's decision is supported by law, and we are unable to conclude that the decision was arbitrary, unreasonable, or unconscionable. Accordingly, we find that the trial court\n   did not abuse its discretion in disqualifying Attorney Beranek.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   {\u00b6 43} Judgment affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   EILEEN T.
