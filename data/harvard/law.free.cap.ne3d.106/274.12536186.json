This Court affirms in part and reverses in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 2} A grand jury indicted Mr. Yeager in two separate criminal cases. In Case No. 2016-07-2429(A), he was indicted on one count each of receiving stolen property, possessing criminal tools, obstructing official business, and driving under suspension. In Case No. 2016-11-3971, he was indicted on four counts of breaking and entering. A court-appointed attorney initially represented Mr. Yeager in both cases, but withdrew from representation when Mr. Yeager declared his intention to represent himself. The trial court ultimately accepted Mr. Yeager's decision to waive his right to counsel and later appointed stand-by counsel to assist him at trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 3} Mr. Yeager's two cases were tried together. His counts for possessing criminal tools and driving under suspension were ultimately dismissed, but the jury found him guilty of each of his remaining counts. In Case No. 2016-07-2429(A), the court sentenced him to a total of six months in prison. In Case No. 2016-11-3971, the court sentenced him to a total of four years in prison and ordered him to\n   pay $14,928.18 in restitution. The court ordered his sentences to run consecutively for a total of four and one-half years in prison.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 4} Mr. Yeager appealed his convictions in both cases, and this Court consolidated the two appeals for purposes of review and decision. Mr. Yeager raises six assignments of error for our review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR ONE\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   THE TRIAL COURT COMMITTED REVERSIBLE AND PLAIN ERROR WHEN IT PERMITTED DEFENDANT TO PROCEED PRO SE WITHOUT SUBSTANTIALLY COMPLYING WITH CRIM.R. 44(A), AND IN VIOLATION OF SIXTH AND FOURTEENTH AMENDMENTS TO THE UNITED STATES CONSTITUTION AND SECTION 10, ARTICLE 1 OF THE OHIO CONSTITUTION.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 5} In his first assignment of error, Mr. Yeager argues that the trial court violated Crim.R. 44 and his constitutional rights by allowing him to act pro se. He asserts that he is entitled to relief because the court did not ensure that his waiver of counsel was knowingly, voluntarily, and intelligently entered or reduced to writing and signed in open court.

The court held a hearing on his motion the following week and, after permitting counsel to withdraw, spoke directly with Mr. Yeager. The court explained to Mr. Yeager the State's current plea offer, all of the charges against him, and the possible maximum sentences he faced.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%20659374\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The court also repeatedly emphasized that he would be \"at a tremendous disadvantage\" if he chose to represent himself because he would be responsible for knowing the rules of evidence and criminal procedure, identifying the issues, and raising any applicable defenses. The court offered to appoint new counsel for Mr. Yeager or to afford him more time to consider, but Mr. Yeager declined and indicated that he wished to represent himself. The court then asked Mr. Yeager whether he understood its warnings about self-representation and whether he understood that he would not receive \"special consideration\" if he chose to go forward without counsel. Each time the court inquired of Mr. Yeager, he indicated that he understood and wished to represent himself. The court, therefore, accepted Mr. Yeager's waiver of his right to counsel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   {\u00b6 9} The record reflects that the court did not strictly comply with Crim.R. 44(A) when it accepted Mr. Yeager's waiver because it did not reduce his waiver to writing. As noted, however, strict compliance with Crim.R. 44(A) is not required so long as a court, through adequate inquiry, ensures that a defendant fully understands and intelligently relinquishes his right to counsel.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Tucker\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016-Ohio-1354\">\n    2016-Ohio-1354\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=62%20N.E.3d%20893\">\n    62 N.E.3d 893\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at \u00b6 17 ;\n   <em>\n    Martin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1503069\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-st-3d/103/385/\">\n    103 Ohio St.3d 385\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2004-Ohio-5471\">\n    2004-Ohio-5471\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=816%20N.E.2d%20227\">\n    816 N.E.2d 227\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at \u00b6 39. Though Mr. Yeager argues that the court engaged in an inadequate inquiry, the record belies his argument. Moreover, to the extent that the court's initial inquiry was in any way limited, the record reflects that the court revisited the topic of counsel a number of times before Mr. Yeager actually went to trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   {\u00b6 10} Four months ultimately elapsed between Mr. Yeager's initial request to represent himself and his trial. During that time, he filed a wealth of motions pertaining to discovery, potential\n   <em>\n    Brady v. Maryland\n   </em>\n   violations, prosecutorial misconduct, and suppression. The court conducted multiple pre-trials and, at the majority of them, spoke to Mr. Yeager about his decision to waive counsel. The court informed Mr. Yeager that he was placing himself at a disadvantage by not having counsel who could locate witnesses, timely file the proper motions, and sort out discovery matters on his behalf. Nevertheless, Mr. Yeager repeatedly rejected the court's offer to appoint him new counsel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   {\u00b6 11} One month before trial, the court held another pretrial and once more encouraged Mr. Yeager to accept new counsel. The court noted that an attorney would not suffer from the same time and access restrictions that Mr. Yeager faced while incarcerated. The court also asked Mr. Yeager whether he had a high-level of confidence as far as examining witnesses and speaking with the jury because he would have to handle those matters himself if he chose not to have counsel. The court informed Mr. Yeager that, while he seemed \"bright enough,\" the court always discouraged lay people from representing themselves due to their unfamiliarity with\n   the rules of evidence and procedure. During that conversation, the court explained to Mr. Yeager the concept of stand-by counsel and asked whether he would be willing to accept that option. Mr. Yeager ultimately agreed to stand-by counsel, but reiterated that he did not wish to accept the appointment of another attorney. Mr. Yeager represented to the court that \"this [was] not [his] first time being pro se.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   {\u00b6 12} Upon review, we must conclude that Mr. Yeager validly waived his right to counsel. The record reflects that he understood his right, but was adamant about his decision to represent himself.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Tucker\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016-Ohio-1354\">\n    2016-Ohio-1354\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=62%20N.E.3d%20893\">\n    62 N.E.3d 893\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at \u00b6 18-19. He indicated, on more than one occasion, that he understood he would be bound by the rules of evidence and criminal procedure if he chose to represent himself. He also indicated that he understood the charges against him and maximum penalties he faced if convicted. Further, he indicated that he understood the court's warnings about being \"at a tremendous disadvantage\" if he chose to represent himself. \"The trial court sufficiently explained the dangers of self-representation, the nature of the charge[s] against [him], and the allowable penalties for [those] charge[s].\"\n   <em>\n    City of Akron v.

The record reflects that Mr. Yeager conducted the vast majority of his defense, giving an opening statement and closing argument, examining all of the witnesses, and lodging virtually all of the objections. Even so, stand-by counsel also participated at several points in the proceedings. For instance, stand-by counsel conducted all of the voir dire, gave a brief opening statement that preceded Mr. Yeager's, argued Mr. Yeager's Crim.R. 29 motions, and gave a portion of the closing argument.

A trial court need only conduct a hearing on jail-time credit \"if one is requested.\" R.C. 2929.19(B)(2)(g)(i). Mr. Yeager never asked the trial court to conduct a hearing on jail-time credit. Although he made a statement that he had been incarcerated from \"October 3rd to now * * *,\" he gave no indication that he wanted to present evidence on that issue. Moreover, because the court had yet to compute his time, there was no indication at that point that Mr. Yeager would contest the court's computation.

Mr. Yeager claims, without citing any portion of the record, that he is entitled to 170 days of credit because he was incarcerated \"from October 3, 2016 to March 21, 2017.\" Upon review of the record, however, this Court is unable to verify those dates. It appears that, on October 13, 2016, Mr. Yeager was scheduled for a status hearing, but did not appear because he was being held at the Cleveland House of Corrections/Cleveland Workhouse. At the status hearing, his former attorney notified the court that Mr. Yeager was being held on an unrelated matter. Pursuant to R.C. 2929.19(B)(2)(g)(i), an offender is only entitled to jail-time credit for the days he has been confined \"for any reason arising out of the offense for which [he] is being sentenced * * *.\" Thus, if Mr. Yeager was being held on another matter, he was not entitled to jail-time credit for purposes of this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   {\u00b6 27} Apart from setting forth a blanket statement that he is entitled to additional credit, Mr. Yeager has made no attempt to point to any evidence tending to show that the court did not properly calculate his jail-time credit.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   This Court will\n   not construct an argument on his behalf.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.
