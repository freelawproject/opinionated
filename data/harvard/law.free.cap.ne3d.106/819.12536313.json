Ricer [\"Ricer\"] appeals his convictions and sentences after a jury trial in the Ashland Municipal Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <em>\n    Facts and Procedural History\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 2} Sometime between 1:30 a.m. and 2:00 a.m. on March 4, 2017, officers from the Ashland City Police Department did a walk-thru at a local bar called the Wagon Wheel. Ricer was seen sleeping at a table by himself, with a few pizza boxes in front of him and several beer cans by his head. The officers noticed that a vehicle registered to Ricer was parked illegally on the street outside of the bar. The officers did not ticket the vehicle.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 3} Later in the evening and after the last walk-through Officer Kunzen radioed to Officer Schwan that Ricer was leaving the bar and driving away in his truck. Officers Schwan and Eggeman drove to the area in the same patrol car. The officers\n   saw no traffic infractions by Ricer as they followed him on Third Street. The officers observed Ricer make a \"very slow, methodical, fluid\" turn onto Cottage Street. The officers observed Ricer's truck travel left of center. (T. at 22). The driver's side tire traveled completely over the centerline near Fourth Street. (Id.). Ricer made another slow, methodical, fluid turn left onto Ohio. In making that turn, the officers saw Ricer almost strike the curb, but jerked the wheel back. Officer Schwan turned on his overhead lights on Ohio Street; however, Ricer continued driving turning right onto to Arch Street. Because Ricer continued to drive, Officer Schwan sounded his siren. Ricer continued to drive a short distance before stopping.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 4} During their interaction with Ricer at his vehicle, the officers noted an odor of alcoholic beverage, slightly slurred speech, and glassy, watery eyes. Ricer did admit to drinking a couple of beers at the Wagon Wheel bar that night.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 5} Ricer was asked out of the vehicle to perform field sobriety tests. Ricer was given the Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus Test. (T. 31). Ricer told the officer that he had cataract surgery and had lenses in his eyes. The officer observed six clues of a possible six clues. Ricer was then asked to recite the alphabet without singing the song beginning with the letter \"D\" and ending with the letter \"N.\" Ricer had a difficult time. Ricer was offered the Walk and Turn test, but said he could not do the test because his foot or leg had been broken a few years prior (T. 39). Ricer offered to show the officers the black and blue marks on his leg; however, the officer told Ricer they would take his word for it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 6} During the stop, Ricer became slightly argumentative with the officers. (T. at 41). Ricer indicated that he wanted to take a portable breathalyzer test. The officer indicted that he had such a device but did not offer it to Ricer. Ricer later volunteered without being asked that he would not take a breathalyzer test. (T. at 41). Ricer was placed under arrest for Operating a Vehicle while under the Influence of Alcohol [OVI] in violation of R.C. 4511.19(A)(1)(a), and Driving Left of Center under Ashland City Ordinance 331.05. At the police station, Ricer was read the BMV 2255 form and refused to submit to the breath test. Ricer was charged under R.C. 4511.19(A)(2)(b), which prohibits individuals, after being arrested for operating a vehicle while under the influence from refusing to submit to a chemical blood-alcohol test if they have been convicted of an OVI offense within the previous 20 years.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 7} Ricer did not file a motion to suppress challenging the validity of the stop, his arrest or the administration of the field sobriety tests.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 8} A jury trial commenced on June 8, 2017. The parties stipulated that the Ricer had been previously convicted of a prior OVI on July 21, 2000. A video of the traffic stop and the officers' interaction with Ricer was played for the jury and admitted into evidence as State's Exhibit 2. At the conclusion of the trial, Ricer was found guilty of OVI. The judge found Ricer guilty of the Left of Center charge. The court sentenced Ricer to 180 days incarceration, with 90 suspended, 3-year license suspension, and a $525.00 fine, plus costs on the OVI conviction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <em>\n    Assignments of error\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {\u00b6 9} Ricer raises one assignment of error,\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   {\u00b6 10} \"I.
