For the following reasons, this Court affirms.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 2} When D.J. was 15, he anally raped his 3-year-old sister, which caused injuries that resulted in her death. The juvenile court adjudicated him guilty of rape and felony murder and designated him a serious youthful offender. It committed him to the Ohio Department of Youth Services (DYS) and stayed his adult sentence of life imprisonment with the possibility of parole after 25 years. D.J. appealed his adjudication. He also petitioned for post-conviction relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 3} D.J. behaved well during his commitment. He completed high school, took college classes, began an apprenticeship, and even helped tutor others. In light of his ongoing legal proceedings, however, he declined to enroll in sex offender treatment. Eventually, he voluntarily dismissed his appeal and withdrew his petition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 4} Following the end of D.J.'s appeal and petition, the juvenile court wrote that his sex offender treatment would begin shortly. D.J. did not decide to enter the program, however, until nine months before he was going to turn 21. Despite attending and participating in the first\n   part of the program, D.J. did not meet its goals because he could not identify the triggers for his conduct. He, therefore, could not continue into the second part of the program, which helps participants develop strategies to manage their triggers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 5} Approximately 50 days before D.J.'s twenty-first birthday, the State moved for the juvenile court to invoke the adult portion of D.J.'s sentence. Following an evidentiary hearing, the juvenile court granted its motion, finding that D.J., by failing to complete sex offender treatment, engaged in conduct that poses a substantial risk to the safety of the community. The court also found that he could not be rehabilitated before turning 21. It subsequently imposed D.J.'s adult sentence of life imprisonment with the opportunity for parole after 25 years. D.J. has appealed, assigning five errors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR I\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   THE STATE CANNOT INITIATE THE REQUEST TO INVOKE THE ADULT PORTION OF A CHILD'S SYO WHEN THE CHILD IS IN DYS'S INSTITUTIONAL CUSTODY, IN VIOLATION OF R.C. 2152.14(A).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 6} D.J. argues that the State's motion to invoke was improper under Revised Code Section 2152.14(A). That section provides, in part, that \"[t]he director of youth services may request the prosecuting attorney of the county in which is located the juvenile court that imposed a serious youthful offender dispositional sentence * * * to file a motion with that juvenile court to invoke the adult portion of the dispositional sentence * * *.\" According to D.J., under the statute, only the director of DYS can initiate the request to invoke the adult part of the dispositional sentence for a serious youthful offender. Here, however, the prosecutor sent a letter to DYS, requesting that it join in a motion to invoke. D.J. contends that DYS's staff was actually preparing him for release into the community until the prosecutor interfered in the process.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {\u00b6 7} Section 2152.14 does not provide any guidance for how the director of DYS should decide whether to request that the prosecuting attorney move for the juvenile court to invoke the adult part of a dispositional sentence. The statute's only requirements are that the juvenile be at least 14 years old, that the juvenile be in the custody of or has escaped custody of DYS, and that the juvenile be serving the juvenile part of a serious youthful offender dispositional sentence. R.C. 2152.14(A)(2). D.J. has not pointed to any language in Section 2152.14 that prohibits the prosecution from attempting to influence the director's exercise of discretion under Section 2152.14(A). D.J.'s first assignment of error is overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR II\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   THE JUVENILE COURT ERRED WHEN IT DETERMINED THAT D.J. ENGAGED IN CONDUCT THAT CREATES A SUBSTANTIAL RISK TO THE SAFETY AND SECURITY OF THE INSTITUTION, COMMUNITY, OR THE VICTIM IN THE ABSENCE OF CLEAR AND CONVINCING EVIDENCE, IN VIOLATION OF THE FIFTH AND FOURTEENTH AMENDMENTS TO THE U.S. CONSTITUTION; ARTICLE 1, SECTION 16, OHIO CONSTITUTION ; AND, R.C. 2152.14(E).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   {\u00b6 8} D.J. next argues that there was insufficient evidence to support the juvenile court's findings under Section 2152.14(E)(1). That section provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   The juvenile court may invoke the adult portion of a person's serious youthful offender dispositional sentence if the juvenile court finds all of the following on the record by clear and convincing evidence:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   (a) The person is serving the juvenile portion of a serious youthful offender dispositional sentence.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   (b) The person is at least fourteen years of age and has been admitted to a department of youth services facility, or criminal charges are pending against the person.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   (c) The person engaged in the conduct or acts charged under division (A), (B), or (C) of this section, and the person's conduct demonstrates that the person is unlikely to be rehabilitated during the remaining period of juvenile jurisdiction.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   R.C. 2152.14(E)(1). Clear and convincing evidence is that \"which will produce in the mind of the trier of facts a firm belief or conviction as to the facts sought to be established.\"\n   <em>\n    Cross v. Ledford\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1700695\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-st/161/469/\">\n    161 Ohio St. 469\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=120%20N.E.2d%20118\">\n    120 N.E.2d 118\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1954), paragraph three of the syllabus. The conduct referred to in Section 2152.14(E)(1)(c) includes that \"[t]he person has engaged in conduct that creates a substantial risk to the safety or security of the institution, the community, or the victim.\" R.C. 2152.14(A)(2)(b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   {\u00b6 9} The juvenile court found that D.J. had been defiant about his need to engage in sex offender treatment and that he had failed to complete such treatment. It also found that, following the exhaustion of his appeals, D.J. had 29 months to complete sex offender treatment, which typically takes between 9 and 18 months. The court found that D.J. delayed entering the program and inquired at one point about whether he could fake his treatment. It also found that, although D.J. eventually began the treatment program, he could not understand what he needed to do to prevent a relapse of his conduct. In conclusion, the court found that, \"[a]bsent an understanding of his triggers, his cycle and what he needs to do to refrain from similar offenses, the Court finds that [D.J.] has engaged in conduct that poses a[ ] substantial risk to the safety of the community.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   {\u00b6 10} The State presented testimony that D.J. was disengaged from his emotions. He resisted taking responsibility for harming his sister and failed to complete an appropriate victim apology letter, writing it to his parents instead of his sister. Although he could understand the offense cycle academically, he was unable to plug his own offense into the cycle to understand what triggered his offense. Specifically, he was unable to break down the series of events that led up to the offense, including the things that caused him to start thinking about doing it and the thinking errors that he made along the way. The State's witnesses testified that D.J.'s effort during sex offender treatment sessions was limited and that his participation was minimal. Because of his failure to master the first phase's skills and material, he could not progress into the second phase of the program where he would have developed a relapse prevention plan. The staff member who conducted D.J.'s class was concerned about D.J.'s ability to function in all aspects of his life back in the community without an understanding of his triggers and without a relapse prevention plan in place.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   {\u00b6 11} The word \"conduct\" is not defined in Chapter 2152, but it commonly refers to someone's \"[p]ersonal behavior, whether by action or inaction[.]\"\n   <em>\n    Black's Law Dictionary\n   </em>\n   315 (8th Ed.2004). D.J. intentionally waited until only 9 months before he turned 21 to begin sex offender treatment, which was too late for him to finish it in light of his minimal participation\n   and emotional detachment from his offense. Upon review of the record, we conclude that there was sufficient evidence for the juvenile court to find by clear and convincing evidence that D.J., in failing to complete sex offender treatment, engaged in conduct that created a substantial risk to the safety of the community.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   {\u00b6 12} D.J. also argues that the court's finding was against the manifest weight of the evidence. We apply the same manifest weight standard in both criminal and civil cases. When conducting a manifest weight review, we are required to \"review the entire record, weigh the evidence and all reasonable inferences, consider the credibility of witnesses and determine whether, in resolving conflicts in the evidence, the trier of fact clearly lost its way and created such a manifest miscarriage of justice that the [judgment] must be reversed and a new trial ordered.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

We note that, even if most of DYS's staff, generally, was preparing D.J. for his release into the community, the instructor of D.J.'s sex offender treatment class testified that he was concerned about D.J.'s ability to function back in the community because he did not understand his triggers and did not have a relapse prevention plan in place. Upon careful review of the record, we conclude that the juvenile court's findings were not against the manifest weight of the evidence. D.J.'s second assignment of error is overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR III\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   THE MANDATORY SENTENCING SCHEME IN R.C. 2971.03 IS UNCONSTITUTIONAL BECAUSE IT DOES NOT PERMIT THE JUVENILE COURT TO MAKE AN INDIVIDUALIZED DETERMINATION ABOUT D.J.'S SENTENCE OR THE ATTRIBUTES OF HIS YOUTH, IN VIOLATION OF HIS RIGHT TO BE FREE FROM CRUEL AND UNUSUAL PUNISHMENT, AS GUARANTEED BY THE EIGHTH AMENDMENT TO THE U.S. CONSTITUTION; AND, ARTICLE I, SECTION 9, OHIO CONSTITUTION.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   {\u00b6 14} D.J. next argues that his adult sentence violates his right to be free from cruel and unusual punishment because the juvenile court was not allowed to consider his age or other mitigating factors in determining his sentence. Because D.J. committed rape and murder, the juvenile court was required to impose an adult sentence of 25 years to life imprisonment. R.C. 2152.13(D)(1)(a) ; R.C. 2971.03(B)(1)(c).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   {\u00b6 15} The State argues that D.J. forfeited his constitutional argument because he did not raise it at the time the trial court initially imposed his sentence. It points out that in\n   <em>\n    In re Feaster\n   </em>\n   , 9th Dist. Summit No. 25395,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2011-Ohio-4222\">\n    2011-Ohio-4222\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2011%20WL%204357226\">\n    2011 WL 4357226\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , this Court recognized that, when a juvenile court designates a serious\n   youthful offender, it imposes an actual prison sentence, even though the sentence is stayed.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 11-12. The State also argues that D.J.'s argument was available to him, noting that the United States and Ohio Supreme Court decisions that D.J. relies on pre-date his disposition as a serious youthful offender.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   {\u00b6 16} D.J. argues that he should be permitted to raise his constitutionality argument because his adult prison sentence did not become a reality until the juvenile court imposed it in November 2016. He also notes that Section 2152.14(E)(2) authorizes a juvenile court to modify the adult portion of a person's serious youthful offender sentence at the time the court invokes it. He further notes that, in\n   <em>\n    Feaster\n   </em>\n   , this Court allowed Tyree Feaster to withdraw his plea agreement after the State moved to invoke the adult portion of his sentence because the juvenile court had not properly advised him of post-release control.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 13.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   {\u00b6 17} Under the \"doctrine of res judicata, a valid final judgment on the merits bars all subsequent actions based on any claim arising out of the transaction or occurrence that was the subject matter of the previous action.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

The court went on, however, to order D.J. \"to be adjudicated a Tier III Sex Offender * * *.\" The definition of a \"Tier III sex offender * * *\" includes \"[a] sex offender who * * * has been adjudicated a delinquent child for committing any sexually oriented offense and who a juvenile court, pursuant to section 2152.82, 2152.83, 2152.84, or 2152.85 * * * classifies a tier III sex offender * * * relative to the offense.\" R.C. 2950.01(G)(3). Although the juvenile court used the word \"adjudicate\" in its entry instead of \"classify,\" the difference between the two words in this context is not significant. In addition, D.J. has not identified any difference in the requirements placed on a Tier III sex offender who receives that designation automatically for being convicted of certain offenses as an adult and juveniles who receive that designation under Section 2950.01(G)(3). Accordingly, upon review of the juvenile\n   court's entry, we conclude that any error in the court's word choice was harmless. D.J.'s fifth assignment of error is overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   III.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   {\u00b6 24} D.J.'s assignments of error are overruled. The judgment of the Summit County Court of Common Pleas, Juvenile Division, is affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Judgment affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   CALLAHAN, J.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   CONCURS.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   CARR, J., CONCURRING IN JUDGMENT ONLY.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   {\u00b6 25} The landscape regarding juvenile justice has changed dramatically in the last ten years. This case is an example of the difficulty in attempting to apply juvenile and adult rehabilitative statutes and theories when a child commits a serious offense. I encourage the Supreme Court and legislature to address these matters to provide necessary guidance to the juvenile courts.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
