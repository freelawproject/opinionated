Heard appeals from a judgment of the Montgomery County Court of Common Pleas, which granted summary judgment in favor of Dayton View Commons Homes and Oberer Management Services (collectively \"Dayton View\") on Heard's claim for personal injury. For the following reasons, the judgment of the trial court will be affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   {\u00b6 2} Heard's pro se complaint was filed on November 17, 2016. The complaint had several attachments and alleged that, on November 24, 2014, he had fallen at the threshold of his apartment because of water that had seeped under the exterior door, a problem about which he had previously complained to management. He stated that he hit his back, neck, and head on the ground, that the fall caused him to have surgery on his \"cervical,\" and that treatment was ongoing. He sought $5 million in compensatory and punitive damages. No specific medical records or expert opinions were attached to the complaint.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   {\u00b6 3} Dayton View filed an answer denying Heard's allegations and raising affirmative defenses. It also filed a notice disclosing its expert witness, a notice to take\n   a medical examination (of Heard), and a notice to take Heard's deposition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 4} On May 25, 2017, Dayton View filed a motion for summary judgment. The motion stated that Heard alleged that he had neck surgery as a result of his fall, but that his medical records indicated that his physicians had been recommending neck surgery for a couple of years prior to the fall. Dayton View's motion also asserted that Heard presented \"no expert testimony to establish that the neck surgery was in any way proximately related to the alleged slip and fall.\" The motion relied on Heard's deposition testimony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 5} Heard did not file a response to the motion for summary judgment. On July 28, 2017, the trial court granted Dayton View's motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 6} Heard filed a notice of appeal and a pro se brief. The brief does not set forth assignments of error or otherwise comply with App.R. 16(A), but it does demonstrate that Heard disagrees with the trial court's award of summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Summary Judgment Standard\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 7} Pursuant to Civ.R. 56(C), summary judgment is proper when (1) there is no genuine issue as to any material fact, (2) the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law, and (3) reasonable minds, after construing the evidence most strongly in favor of the nonmoving party, can only conclude adversely to that party.\n   <em>\n    Zivich v.

Citing\n   <em>\n    Wing\n   </em>\n   , it argued that the party moving for summary judgment \"is not required to present evidence negating elements of the Plaintiff's claim. Rather, the party opposing summary judgment has the burden of producing specific evidence to establish each element of each claim for which he bears the burden of production at trial.\" Actually, it is only once the moving party had met its burden of pointing to evidentiary material that shows there is no genuine issue of material fact that the non-moving party has to do anything. Regardless, the trial court utilized the correct standard, i.e., that the moving party bears\n   the initial burden of showing that no genuine issue of material fact exists for trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 10} We review the trial court's ruling on a motion for summary judgment de novo.\n   <em>\n    Schroeder v.

Soft-tissue injuries like neck and back strains and sprains require expert testimony to establish a causal connection, because they are injuries that are \"internal and elusive, and are not sufficiently observable, understandable, and comprehensible\" to be matters of common knowledge.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2006%20WL%20391823\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , citing\n   <em>\n    Wright\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 19.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Analysis\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   {\u00b6 14} In support of its motion for summary judgment, Dayton View relied on Heard's deposition testimony. In his deposition, Heard, age 59, testified that he had experienced back pain for many years prior to his fall, had been on disability since 2005 for back pain, and had been treated for pain management for \"a very long time\" with injections and physical therapy. Heard was advised by his doctor in 2012 to get a spinal cord stimulator implant, but he refused.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   {\u00b6 15} Heard further testified that, in 2013, he began experiencing neck pain and tingling in his left arm following a motor vehicle accident, and he continued to have lower back pain; he again refused to consider a spinal cord stimulator. His medical records, about which he was questioned during the deposition, indicated that his chief complaint at that time was neck pain. Heard was also advised by his doctor that\n   he should have surgery to decompress his spine to prevent further damage, symptoms, or loss of function in his limbs, including possible paralysis. Although Heard refused to have the surgery at that time, he acknowledged that he had been informed that surgery might be needed in the future if his condition deteriorated. Heard also acknowledged that his discussion with his doctor in 2013 included discussion of whether surgery on his back and neck could be done at the same time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   {\u00b6 16} In January 2014, several months before Heard's fall at his apartment, he had an MRI, which his doctors compared with an MRI he had had in 2012. According to Heard, the doctor told him that his spine \"was compressed worse\" than it had been previously.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   {\u00b6 17} Heard testified that, when he fell, his neighbor immediately called for an ambulance and he was taken to a hospital; he got a \"pain shot\" and x-rays were taken, but the nurse or technician \"didn't see anything in the X rays.\" He was released the same day, and he \"hadn't followed up with anybody\" for medical care. However, Heard's neck and shoulder \"got to hurting really, really bad where [he] was starting to lose mobility,\" so he eventually called his \"orthopedic,\" who again recommended that he have surgery for \"severity of the cervical.\" The time that had elapsed is unclear, but Heard's testimony about his medical records indicates that he saw a doctor on January 16, 2015, at which time he reported numbness and tingling in his hand. Another MRI was scheduled for June 2015. Heard had surgery on his neck in July 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   {\u00b6 18} When Heard was asked during his deposition how he had gotten the idea that his fall created the need for surgery, he answered, \"Because I was having no problems with my neck until after the fall.\" But he acknowledged that he had been told in 2013 that he might need an operation on his neck in the future; Heard told the doctor at that time that surgery \"wasn't necessary\" because he \"wasn't having any complications.\" Heard testified in his deposition that his pain had worsened after his fall, but he also testified that such a deterioration of his condition had been anticipated by and discussed with his physicians prior to the fall. Heard could not remember whether anyone had ever told him that the need for surgery was related to his November 2014 fall. Heard stated that he had not hired an expert to evaluate this issue, because he could not afford one.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   {\u00b6 19} Based on Heard's deposition testimony, the trial court found that he had experienced neck and back pain prior to his fall. He had discussed with his doctor the option of surgery at that time to decompress his spinal cord, the possible need to have surgery in the future, and the potential for further deterioration of his condition. The trial court found that Dayton View had presented evidence that Heard had neck issues prior to the fall. Heard did not present an expert opinion as to the existence of a different injury after the fall, the aggravation of a pre-existing condition, or the reason for the July 2015 surgery. The trial court concluded that his own lay opinion could not create a genuine issue of material fact that would refute the medical evidence that there were other causes of Heard's neck pain, as presented by Dayton View through Heard's testimony about his medical records. Thus, the court concluded that, even construing the evidence in the light most favorable to Heard, Heard had not met his burden of showing that there was a genuine issue of material fact on proximate causation, i.e., that his fall had created a neck injury and/or the need for surgery on Heard's neck.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   {\u00b6 20} This case is closely analogous to\n   <em>\n    Jacobs v. Gateway Property Mgt.\n   </em>\n   , 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 84973,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2005-Ohio-1983\">\n    2005-Ohio-1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2005%20WL%20991902\">\n    2005 WL 991902\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , where a tenant fell in his apartment after water leaked from a pipe onto the floor. The tenant alleged that he suffered back injuries as a result of his fall, but he did not produce medical records documenting treatment for the fall or an expert opinion regarding the cause of his injury. His medical records did, however, document a \"prior existing back injury.\" In affirming the trial court's decision granting summary judgment to the landlord, the Eighth District observed that \"expert testimony and * * * treatment records for the instant slip and fall [were] especially crucial\" because of the pre-existing injury and that, in the absence of such evidence, the tenant \"did not meet his burden of establishing a direct and proximate causal relationship between the claimed injury and the slip and fall.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 13. (The court also found that the water on the floor was an open and obvious hazard about which the tenant was \"fully aware,\" such that he failed to establish that the landlord had a duty to protect him from the hazard.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 15.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   {\u00b6 21} The trial court did not err in granting summary judgment in favor of Dayton View. Dayton View pointed to evidentiary material-Heard's medical records-that tended to prove that the fall was not the cause of the injury and surgery. Although Heard stated at one point that he \"was having no problems with his neck until after the fall,\" his specific testimony about his medical records and history contradicted this statement; his deposition testimony about his medical records clearly indicated that he suffered from neck pain before the fall. No expert testimony or medical records linked the subsequent treatment to the fall, as opposed to his pre-existing neck problems. Under the circumstances presented in this case, where pre-existing neck pain and a likely need for surgery were documented in Heard's medical records, he was required to provide expert medical testimony or other evidentiary material to support his assertion that the fall was the cause of some or all of his neck pain, and thus to create a genuine issue of material fact. In the absence of such evidence, summary judgment was appropriate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   {\u00b6 22} The judgment of the trial court will be affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   HALL, J. and TUCKER, J., concur.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-36\">\n    A letter from United Healthcare to Heard was attached to the complaint, along with other non-medical documents.
