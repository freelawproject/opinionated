The city is empowered to zone property in an effort to change the character of a neighborhood. Appellants did not meet their high burden of establishing that the zoning applied to their property is unconstitutional. Nor did they establish a total regulatory taking, i.e., that the zoning deprived the owner of all economically viable uses of the land, assuming such a claim was properly pled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    Facts\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 2} Fulton Railroad Company (\"Fulton\"), Sawyer Place Company (\"Sawyer\"), and Cincinnati Barge &amp; Rail Terminal, LLC, (\"Cincinnati Barge\") claim that the zoning of the property at issue as \"Riverfront Residential/Recreational\" (\"RF-R\") is unconstitutional. The subject property, owned by Fulton and Sawyer, consists of 26-plus acres along the Ohio River, upriver from downtown Cincinnati. It abuts the Theodore M. Berry International\n   Friendship Park to the west, light industrial property to the east, and residential property to the northwest. Approximately 18 of these acres are out of the floodplain-making the property somewhat unique.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 3} The property, used for commercial and industrial purposes for at least 200 years, is currently used by Cincinnati Barge as a barge terminal. Materials are offloaded from barges, stored in yards, and loaded onto trucks and railcars for further transport. For decades, the city has wanted the property to be used for high-end residential purposes, and has zoned it accordingly. Despite this zoning, the code allows Cincinnati Barge to continue its operations as a legal, nonconforming use.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 4} In 2007, the city rezoned the property to Planned Development 46 (\"PD-46\") via Cincinnati Ordinance 39-2007. Before this change, the property, which consists of multiple parcels, had a unified zoning designation of \"Planned Development 17\" (\"PD-17\"). Prior to PD-17 zoning, the parcels were in two zoning categories, \"R-5(T)\" and \"RF-2.\" The PD-46 designation allows development for office, hotel, and residential mixed-uses. Among other requirements, a final development plan had to be submitted and approved to keep the PD-46 designation. If a final development plan was not approved, Cincinnati Ordinance 39-2007 provided that the property would \"revert\" to RF-R, a zoning classification it never previously had.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 5} In 2014, after numerous extensions, the city denied Sawyer's request to modify PD-46 to adopt its present use as the final development plan, and also denied its request for yet another extension to submit a final development plan. The PD-46 designation terminated. Under Cincinnati Ordinance 39-2007, the property \"reverted\" to RF-R.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    Procedural Posture\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 6} Appellants filed this action seeking a declaration that RF-R zoning is unconstitutional as applied to the subject property. Appellants contended, in relevant part, that (1) the zoning designation deprived them of economically viable uses;\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   (2) the uses permitted by the RF-R zoning were not \"reasonably practical\" uses; (3) the RF-R zoning bears no reasonable relationship to the preservation of the public health, safety, morals, or general welfare; and (4) the zoning failed to substantially advance a legitimate government interest. Appellants also moved for a declaration that Cincinnati Ordinance 39-2007 did not authorize RF-R zoning after the expiration of the PD-46 overlay district because the zoning should have \"reverted\" to what had existed prior to Cincinnati Ordinance 39-2007-namely PD-17, or a combination of R-5(T) and RF-2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 7} The case proceeded to a bench trial, during which numerous experts testified concerning the purpose of the zoning and the economies of developing the property as zoned. Appellants' experts surmised that developing the property for residential purposes in accordance with the RF-R designation was not economically feasible. The city primarily argued that the zoning designation was constitutional because it had a substantial relationship to the city's plan to meet the demand of new residents seeking high-end housing close\n   to downtown Cincinnati and on the Ohio River, and that a high-end residential development was likely to increase property tax revenues. Each side offered experts to rebut the other's experts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 8} In an advisory \"letter decision\" before it formally entered judgment, the trial court indicated that it was sympathetic to appellants' plight, and went so far as to voice skepticism regarding the legal burden placed upon landowners. The trial court nevertheless recognized that it was constrained to apply the law as it found it, and informed the parties that it intended to rule that the zoning was constitutional. The court directed the city to prepare a proposed entry.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {\u00b6 9} The trial court later entered extensive findings of fact and conclusions of law, in which it incorporated its letter-decision, and held that appellants had not met their burden to demonstrate that the zoning regulation was \"clearly arbitrary, unreasonable, or without substantial relation to the public health, safety, morals, and general welfare of the community.\" On this basis alone, the court determined that the zoning regulation was constitutional as applied to the subject property. The court did not directly address appellants' economic-feasibility argument in its conclusions of law, although it made factual findings that appellants had failed to prove that the property could not be developed for a residential use.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   {\u00b6 10} The trial court also concluded that the RF-R designation was not \"revisionary zoning,\" as appellants had contended, because the \"clear intent\" of the city's ordinance \"was to apply RF-R, Riverfront Residential/Recreational, zoning to the subject property should the Planned Development 46 zoning lapse.\" The court dismissed appellants' complaint with prejudice, and entered judgment in favor of the city.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   {\u00b6 11} In appellants' sole assignment of error, they contend that the trial court erred as a matter of law because it failed to apply the proper test for determining the constitutionality of zoning, and that it failed \"to follow the required standards\" for considering whether the zoning as applied to their property is constitutional. Through artful wording, appellants attempt to shoehorn our review solely into a question of law that we review de novo. However, appellants subdivide their assignment of error into six issues. As the city correctly points out, not all of the issues present questions of law. We will address the standard of review for each issue as they come.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   {\u00b6 12}\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     The judgment was consistent with the findings of fact.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   In the first issue presented for review, appellants argue that the trial court's letter-decision indicates that the court found the zoning to be arbitrary and unreasonable and without substantial relation to the public health, safety, morals, or general welfare, and yet failed to enter judgment in appellants' favor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   {\u00b6 13} Application of the law to the trial court's findings presents a legal question that we review de novo.\n   <em>\n    Nationwide Mut.

Appellants do not challenge any particular finding of fact. Rather, in support of their\n   argument, appellants point to the trial court's statements regarding its frustration with the state of the law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   {\u00b6 14} Appellants are correct that, in its letter-decision, the trial court expressed an unambiguous preference to declare the zoning unconstitutional-if it could do so under the law. What the trial court so eloquently put was, \"\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     The law does not permit me to so find\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   , but if I could I would find the mere desire to turn this unique property into a use it has not had for 200 years, no matter how often stated, is arbitrary and capricious without investigation as to whether the change is feasible.\" (Emphasis added.) Rather than being a factual finding in appellant's favor, this is an express statement of judicial restraint. The trial court stated a desire for a different legal standard. The trial court preferred the city be required to conduct an economic-feasibility analysis before rezoning property in a manner that would limit its current use. As the trial court recognized, this isn't the law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   {\u00b6 15} The trial court also preferred that the city not be permitted \"to explicitly preference one economic group over another to benefit its own treasury.\" As the trial court correctly recognized, and as discussed more fully under appellants' third and fourth issues presented for review, these factors do not render a zoning regulation unconstitutional.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   {\u00b6 16} In its journalized findings of fact, the trial court found,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   RF-R zoning is consistent with the publically-stated plans for the subject property. The reasons for the plans include that the City will benefit from additional high-end housing options in the East End neighborhood, which supports the demand for new residents interested in living near the city center and the Ohio River, and that high-end residential development are [sic] likely to increase property tax revenues generated by the subject property as compared with the property tax revenues generated by the current operations on the subject property. Plaintiffs have not proven that the subject property cannot be developed for a residential use beyond fair debate. There are simply too many things not known at this time.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The court's judgment follows from these findings of fact.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   {\u00b6 17} Appellants contend that the court's findings require reversal under\n   <em>\n    Karches v. Cincinnati\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1412057\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-st-3d/38/12/\">\n    38 Ohio St.3d 12\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=526%20N.E.2d%201350\">\n    526 N.E.2d 1350\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1988). Interestingly,\n   <em>\n    Karches\n   </em>\n   involved property owners who wanted to construct a river barge terminal on the Ohio River underneath the I-275 Combs-Hehl Bridge near Coney Island in Cincinnati's California neighborhood. The Supreme Court reinstated the trial court's judgment that the zoning for the site was unconstitutional because it was cost prohibitive to construct the houses above the floodplain, and the allowed commercial uses had either been tried and failed or were cost prohibitive.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 20-22,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=526%20N.E.2d%201350\">\n    526 N.E.2d 1350\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The trial court in that case also found that the zoning decreased the value of the property.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=526%20N.E.2d%201350\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   {\u00b6 18} While the issues here are strikingly similar, the factual findings are strikingly different. Here, most of the property is out of the floodplain, which arguably reduces development costs vis-\u00e0-vis those\n   in\n   <em>\n    Karches\n   </em>\n   . Here, a barge terminal is already in place, in use, and is not required to cease operations. The trial court here found, unlike in\n   <em>\n    Karches,\n   </em>\n   that appellants failed to prove that residential use was not economically viable. Moreover, the trial court found that residential development here is likely to increase the value of the property and the corresponding real estate taxes paid to the city.\n   <em>\n    Karches\n   </em>\n   does not require reversal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   {\u00b6 19} Accordingly, appellants' first issue presented for review is not well taken. The judgment is wholly consistent with the factual findings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   {\u00b6 20}\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     The Disjunctive Test.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   In their second issue presented for review, appellants argue that the trial court misapplied the law because it considered only one test to determine constitutionality when it should have considered two. Determining what the law is presents a question of law that we review de novo. This issue is less a dispute over what the law is, and more a dispute over whether appellants properly asserted a takings claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   {\u00b6 21} In their complaint, appellants sought a declaration that the zoning was unconstitutional because \"The uses permitted of the subject real property ... are not economically viable uses.\" If a property has been totally deprived of its economic value through zoning, a total regulatory taking has occurred.\n   <em>\n    Lucas v. South Carolina Coastal Council\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1481136\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/505/1003/#p1027\">\n    505 U.S. 1003\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1027,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1481136\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/505/1003/#p1027\">\n    112 S.Ct. 2886\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1481136\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/505/1003/#p1027\">\n    120 L.Ed.2d 798\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1992). A large portion of the trial focused on the economic viability of the zoning, with experts testifying to the issue on behalf of both sides. The parties tried the issue, and the trial court issued findings thereon. So even if a takings claim was not pled, it was arguably tried by consent of the parties under Civ.R. 15(B), and \"shall be treated in all respects as if * * * [it] had been raised in the pleadings.\" But, to the extent that the takings issue was raised, it was within the context of a declaratory judgment, not in mandamus.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   {\u00b6 22} The constitutionality of zoning may be challenged via declaratory judgment.\n   <em>\n    Union Oil Co. of California v.

There are two separate tests in\n   <em>\n    Ridge Club\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 11. One renders an ordinance unconstitutional where \"the zoning classification is arbitrary and unreasonable, having no substantial relationship to the health, safety, and welfare of the municipality.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Second, an unconstitutional uncompensated taking occurs where the zoning \"denies the economically viable use of the land * * *.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   So, a party can challenge the constitutionality of a zoning ordinance on either or both of these grounds. The second ground is applicable only where a taking is alleged.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   {\u00b6 24} The city contends that there was no error, and argues that the economic-viability test is not good law. At one time, the Ohio Supreme Court treated the two tests as conjunctive-meaning, to prevail, a plaintiff had to establish that the zoning ordinance was unconstitutional under both tests.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Gerijo, Inc. v.

As stated by a leading treatise on Ohio zoning law, the Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    Goldberg\n   </em>\n   \"abandoned the conjunctive test for the disjunctive test.

The city argues that\n   <em>\n    Goldberg\n   </em>\n   did not adopt a disjunctive test, but instead abandoned the economic-viability test altogether. The landowner there did not assert an economic-viability argument-i.e., a taking, so the test was not relevant to that case. The Supreme Court explained as much in\n   <em>\n    State ex rel.

We will expound on a few examples of the evidence that, when every inference is made favorable to the city, demonstrate the trial court did not lose its way.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   {\u00b6 35} Appellants' experts opined that 13.5 acres of the site would be excavated to a depth of ten feet and refilled-completely removing and replacing 210,000 cubic yards of material at an estimated cost of $10.5 million. The city's expert opined that appellants' expert overestimated both the per unit cost and amount of site preparation work needed. The city's expert countered that only 100,000 cubic yards of excavation and embankment was necessary at a cost of only $650,000. According to the city, total site preparation costs were estimated at only $6 million compared to appellants' estimate of $25 million. It was reasonable for the court to find the city's expert to be more credible, or at the very least that appellants did not meet their burden of establishing the development costs beyond fair debate, which it did when it concluded that \"[p]laintiffs have not proven that the subject property cannot be developed for a residential use beyond fair debate. There are simply too many things not known at this time.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   {\u00b6 36} Moreover, the trial court could have concluded that the \"site density\"-i.e., the number of housing units-in appellants' plan was too low because it was based upon an overly restrictive reading of the city code. The city's expert observed that the site could accommodate many more residences. Appellants' expert agreed, but indicated that would lower the value of each site.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   {\u00b6 37} We also note that appellants could not establish that the present zoning is economically unviable because, unlike in\n   <em>\n    Ridge Club\n   </em>\n   , there is an economically-viable business on the property. Granted, the uses are non-conforming, but they are specifically permitted to continue.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Cincinnati Municipal Code 1447-03.

Of course, what becomes of the property if the present uses cease is a question for another day.

Cincinnati Ordinance 39-2007, which zoned the property PD-46, provided \"That a Final Development Plan shall be approved by the City Planning Commission in accordance with Section 1429-11(C) of the Cincinnati Municipal Code, or the property will revert to the RF-R, Riverfront Residential/Recreational District.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   {\u00b6 40} The trial court concluded, \"The use of the word 'revert' was unfortunate and inaccurate but if the City had used another word, the same thing would have\n   been accomplished.\" Appellants now argue that the property could not possibly \"revert\" to a zoning designation it never had. They do not contend that the reference to RF-R in the ordinance was unintentional or a scrivener's error. Their argument is purely semantical. Appellants contend that the property should have \"reverted\" to the PD-17 designation it had under the former zoning code before the ordinance at issue changed the zoning to RF-R with a PD-46 designation. Under the former code, the property had two different zoning designations, R-5(T) and RF-2, with a designation entitled Planned Development 17. The R-5(T) and RF-2 designations no longer exist in the city's zoning code. Appellants cite no precedent regarding how the ordinance should be interpreted.

The ordinance also likely satisfies the concerns of the\n   <em>\n    Mishr\n   </em>\n   dissent. RF-R is expressly stated. This specific designation in Cincinnati Ordinance 39-2007 controls over the general provision in the zoning code.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Springdale v. CSX Ry.

And there is a reason why the verb \"revert\" was used. Cincinnati Municipal Code 1429-19(c) states that if a PD District expires \"the zoning of the PD District revert [sic] to the zoning district designation in effect immediately before the PD designation.\" Cincinnati Ordinance 39-2007 used \"revert\" to align itself with the language of the city code. The best, fairest reading of Cincinnati Ordinance 39-2007 is that it simultaneously rezoned the property PD-46 and changed the underlying zoning to RF-R.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   {\u00b6 43}\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     The sixth issue is moot.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   In their sixth and final issue, appellants contend that \"when zoning is unconstitutional as applied * * *, it is the duty of the trial court to determine whether the proposed use of the property is reasonable and proper.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   {\u00b6 44} As we have already determined that the trial court correctly found the zoning to be constitutional, we have no occasion to visit the final issue raised by appellants and we disregard it as moot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   <strong>\n    Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   {\u00b6 45} The assignment of error is overruled.
