The judgment itself stated that notice of appeal was given. The clerk certified that no transcript had been demanded or forwarded,</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b83-8\"><em>George McCormick, </em>Assistant Attorney General,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Atx\">filed a written motion, based on the certificate, and asked that the cause be docketed and the judgment be affirmed.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b83-9\">White, J.</author>\n<p id=\"ART\">The appellant, having been convicted of an aggravated assault in the lower court, made a motion to arrest the judgment, which being overruled, he gave notice of appeal in open court.

This cer<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>tificate shall show the style of the cause upon the docket, the offense of which the defendant stands accused, the day on which the judgment was rendered, and the day on which the appeal was taken ; which certified list he shall transmit, postpaid, to the clerk of the Supreme Court (Court of Appeals) at the proper place.\u201d Pasc. Dig., art. 3196.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-5\">\u201cThe clerk of the Supreme Court (Court of Appeals) shall file the certificate provided for in the preceding article, and notify the attorney general that the same has been received.\u201d Pasc. Dig., art. 3197.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-6\">\u201c When it appears by such certificate that an appeal has been taken by the defendant in a criminal action for misdemeanor, and the transcript is not filed within the time required by law for filing transcripts in civil cases, such cause may be entered on the docket, on motion of the attorney general, and the judgment of the District Court (or County Court) shall be affirmed.\u201d Pase. Dig., art. 3198.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-7\">The motion of the assistant attorney general is sustained, and the judgment of the lower court in this case is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-8\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
