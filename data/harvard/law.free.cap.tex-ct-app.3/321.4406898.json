D. Long <em>v. </em>The State.</parties>\n<syllabus data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b331-15\">1. Notice of Appeal. \u2014 The Code is imperative and mandatory in its requirement that the notice of an appeal shall not only be given in open court, but be entered of record.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b332-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>2. Same. \u2014 An entry upon the judge\u2019s docket that \u201cthe defendant gives notice of appeal \u201d is not an entry \u201c of record,\u201d nor tantamount thereto.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b332-5\">8. Same\u2014Practice nr this Court. \u2014 A transcript of a felony case contained no notice of appeal other than an entry transcribed from the judge\u2019s docket. This court, on motion of the attorney general, dismisses the appeal, hut without prejudice to whatever rights the appellant may have under article 3192, Paschal\u2019s Digest, which provides that an appeal, if demanded, shall he allowed after sentence.</syllabus>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b332-6\">Appeal from the District Court of Falls. Tried below before the Hon. L. C. Alexander.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b332-7\">The conviction was for the theft of a cow, and allotted to the appellant five years\u2019 sojourn in the penitentiary.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b332-8\"><em>George McOormick, </em>Assistant Attorney General,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Af5\">for the State, moved to dismiss the appeal, because notice of appeal had not been given in open court and entered of record.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b332-9\"><em>W. B. Forde, </em>for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b332-10\">White, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AkO\">For the reason that a number of errors were apparent upon the record as originally sent up, this court, at a former day of the term, awarded a <em>certiorari </em>to bring up a more perfect record. Both records are now before us, and the assistant attorney general moves to dismiss the appeal, because there is no such record entry of the notice of appeal by defendant as the law requires. To our mind the statute is plain and unambiguous :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-11\">\u201cAn appeal may be taken by the defendant at any time during the term of the court at which the conviction was had.\u201d Pasc. Dig., art. 3189.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-12\">\u201cAn appeal is taken by giving notice thereof in open court, and having the same entered of record.\u201d Pasc. Dig., art. 3190.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b332-13\">This statute is mandatory and imperative. <em>Hicklin </em>v. <em>The State, </em>31 Texas, 492; <em>Hughes </em>v. <em>The State, </em>33 Texas, 683. The notice of appeal in this case was not entered of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>record, though the clerk certifies that the notes made by the judge upon his docket show that defendant did give notice of appeal. The entries upon the judge\u2019s docket will not supply the place of, or supersede the necessity for, an entry upon the record. <em>Forest </em>v. <em>Rawlings, </em>40 Texas, 502.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-6\">The motion of the assistant attorney general must be sustained, and this appeal be dismissed, because the district clerk of Falls County failed to perform a plain and simple duty required of him by law.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-7\">The appeal is dismissed, but without prejudice to any rights which the defendant may have under article 3192, Paschal\u2019s Digest, Avhieli reads as follows :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b333-8\">61 When the defendant fails to appeal until after sentence has been pronounced, the appeal shall nevertheless be allowed if demanded, and has the effect of suspending the execution of the sentence, and all other proceedings, as fully as if taken at the proper time.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b333-9\">\n<em>Appeal dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
