Defendant pleaded general denial and contributory negligence. .Verdict and judgment for plaintiff for $250. It was error for the court to charge the jury, in case they should find defendant was negligent, that \u201cyou will find for plaintiff actual damages in any amount you may think proper. \u201d It left the jury at liberty to award the full amount of the damages claimed, without instructing as to the proper rule by which to estimate damages in the case, which it was the duty of the court to do. [1 Civil Cas. Ct. App., \u00a7\u00a7 446, 1148; 2 Civil Cas. Ct. App., \u00a7 408.]</p>\n<p id=\"b302-3\">\u00a7 210. <em>Same; contributory negligence; duty of passenger on railroad train to avoid injury. </em>The court erred in refusing to give in charge to the jury, as applicable to the facts in the case, the first, second and third special requested instructions of defendant, as follows, viz.: \u2018 \u2018 (1) If you believe from the evidence that the plaintiff became ill after leaving defendant\u2019s train, the burden of proof is on the plaintiff to prove th'at the sickness of his wife resulted from defendant\u2019s act in requiring her to get off the train, and not from other causes; and if plaintiff has failed to do this, you will find for the defendant.\u201d This charge was in conformity with the rules as announced in Railway Co. v. Burns, 71 Tex. 479, and Clark v. Hills, 67 Tex. 141. \u201c (2) If said train ran past the depot at Valley View and then stopped, and plaintiff\u2019s wife left said train at this point, where it stopped, without objection or protest, and without requesting the conductor or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>other agent to run said train back to said depot, plaintiff would not be entitled to recover any damages by reason of his wife\u2019s having to walk back to said section-house or depot. (3) If you find from the evidence that, after leaving said train, plaintiff\u2019s wife walked back to the section-house, and that so walking that distance did not cause her illness, and that while so there any of her relatives or friends proposed to take her home safely, and that she declined said assistance, and subsequently walked a longer distance to her home, and this last walking caused or contributed to her sickness, then you cannot find for the plaintiff, even though defendant was in fault in requiring her to leave the train at a point other than the depot.\u201d It was the passenger\u2019s duty to use ordinary care to prevent injuries to herself greater than the situation demanded.
