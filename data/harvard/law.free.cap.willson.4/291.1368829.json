To entitle appellees to a judgment for such damages, it devolved upon them to both allege and prove that, at the time of delivering the telegram to be transmitted, appellant had knowledge that a failure to transmit and deliver the same might result in causing such special damages to appellees. [Tel. Co. v. McKinney, 2 App. C. C., \u00a7\u00a7 645, 646.] It is not so alleged in the petition, and the judgment is therefore erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"Agg7\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
