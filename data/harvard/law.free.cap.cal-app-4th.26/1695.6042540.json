J.</author>\n<p id=\"b1060-12\">Procedural History</p>\n<p id=\"b1060-13\">On November 24, 1992, an amended information was filed in Madera County Superior Court, charging appellant Ronald Flournoy with forcible <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1697\">*1697</page-number>rape (Pen. Code,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> \u00a7 261, subd. (a)(2)). The amended information contained enhancement allegations concerning convictions previously suffered by Flournoy in Madera County Superior Court case Nos. 5150 and 5931. With regard to case No. 5150, it was alleged that on or about May 26,1981 (later amended by interlineation to Aug. 21, 1981), Flournoy was convicted of attempted rape, thereby suffering a serious felony conviction (\u00a7 667, subd. (a)), for which Flournoy served a prison term (\u00a7 667.5, subd. (b)). With regard to case No. 5931, it was alleged that on or about March 1, 1984, Flournoy was convicted of burglary of an inhabited residence, thereby suffering a serious felony conviction (\u00a7 667, subd. (a)); and was also convicted of rape, thereby suffering a serious felony conviction (\u00a7 667, subd. (a)) and a conviction for an enumerated sex offense (\u00a7 667.6, subd. (a)), for which Flournoy served a prison term (\u00a7 667.5, subd. (b)).</p>\n<p id=\"b1061-5\">Following a court trial, Flournoy was found guilty as charged and all special allegations were found to be true. His motion for a new trial was denied, and he was sentenced to 30 years in prison. The sentence consisted of the upper eight-year term for the current offense; plus consecutive terms of five years (\u00a7 667, subd. (a)) and one year (\u00a7 667.5, subd. (b)) for the 1981 attempted rape conviction (case No. 5150); five years (\u00a7 667, subd. (a)) for the 1984 burglary conviction (case No. 5931); and five years (\u00a7 667, subd. (a)), five years (\u00a7 667.6, subd. (a)), and one year (\u00a7 667.5, subd. (b)) for the 1984 rape conviction (case No. 5931).</p>\n<p id=\"b1061-6\">For the reasons expressed in the published portion of this opinion, we will order stricken the five-year enhancement imposed pursuant to section 667.6, subdivision (a) for the 1984 rape conviction in case No. 5931. For the reasons expressed in the unpublished portions of this opinion, we will order stricken the five-year enhancement imposed pursuant to section 667, subdivision (a) for the 1984 burglary conviction in case No. 5931, as well as both one-year enhancements imposed pursuant to section 667.5, subdivision (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b1061-7\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b1061-8\">I. <em>Imposition of Section 667, Subdivision (a) and Section 667.6, Subdivision (a) Enhancements for the 1984 Rape Conviction.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1061-10\">Section 654 provides in part: \u201cAn act or omission which is made punishable in different ways by different provisions of this code may be punished under either of such provisions, but in no case can it be punished under more than one; . . . .\u201d Flournoy contends the trial court violated this rule by imposing two 5-year enhancements, one pursuant to subdivision (a) of section 667 and the other pursuant to subdivision (a) of section 667.6, for his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1698\">*1698</page-number>1984 rape conviction in case No. 5931. The People respond that the single prior conviction lawfully supports both enhancements. While acknowledging a conflict in appellate decisions concerning the subject, the People urge us to follow those cases which have taken the position that section 654 does not apply to enhancements.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1062-4\">Section 667.6 was enacted by the Legislature in 1979 in order to increase, in certain circumstances, the punishment for persons convicted of serious sex offenses. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Siko </em>(1988) 45 Cal.3d 820, 822 [248 Cal.Rptr. 110, 755 P.2d 294].) Subdivision (a) of section 667.6 states in pertinent part: \u201cAny person who is found guilty of violating paragraph (2) . . . of subdivision (a) of Section 261, . . . who has been convicted previously of any of those offenses shall receive a five-year enhancement for each of those prior convictions provided that no enhancement shall be imposed under this subdivision for any conviction occurring prior to a period of 10 years in which the person remained free of both prison custody and the commission of an offense which results in a felony conviction.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1062-5\">The 1982 initiative measure known as Proposition 8 added section 667 to the Penal Code and article I, section 28, subdivision (f) to the California Constitution.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The electorate\u2019s intent in enacting these provisions was to increase sentences for recidivist offenders. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Jones </em>(1993) 5 Cal.4th 1142, 1147 [22 Cal.Rptr.2d 753, 857 P.2d 1163].) Section 667 provides a sentence enhancement for those persons who repeatedly commit serious felonies.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> To the extent material, subdivision (a) of section 667 states: \u201cIn compliance with subdivision (b) of Section 1385, any person convicted of a serious felony who previously has been convicted of a serious felony in this state . . . shall receive, in addition to the sentence imposed by the court for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1699\">*1699</page-number>the present offense, a five-year enhancement for each such prior conviction on charges brought and tried separately. The terms of the present offense and each enhancement shall run consecutively.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1063-5\">In <em>People </em>v. <em>Jones </em>(1993) 12 Cal.App.4th 1106 [16 Cal.Rptr.2d 60], Division Four of the Second District Court of Appeal held that enhancement terms could not be imposed under both section 667, subdivision (a) and section 667.6, subdivision (a). The court explained: \u201cSections 667, subdivision (a) and 667.6, subdivision (a) each provide for the imposition of an additional five-year term of imprisonment for a recidivist who has sustained a denominated felony conviction after having been previously convicted of the same or another denominated felony in the past. The difference between the sections is that the offenses subject to the provisions of section 667, subdivision (a) include rape . . . among a more general listing of \u2018serious felonies\u2019 and section 667.6, subdivision (a) includes rape . . . among other listed serious felony sex offenses .... Nothing in either of these statutes or in their legislative histories suggests that the Legislature intended that both enhancement terms be applied where, as here, a single conviction . . . qualifies for an enhancement under both sections. Given the overlap between the two statutes noted above, we are loathe to conclude that the Legislature had such distinct, differing policies in mind in enacting them that it intended both to apply to a single conviction which contained two or more qualifying counts.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Jones, supra, </em>12 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1115-1116, fn. omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1063-6\">Unlike the Court of Appeal in <em>Jones, </em>we will not decide what effect, if any, section 654 has upon the two statutes in question. Instead, in accord with the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>People </em>v. <em>Jones, supra, </em>5 Cal.4th 1142, we resolve on different grounds the question whether the trial court correctly imposed both enhancements.</p>\n<p id=\"b1063-7\">In <em>Jones, </em>the trial court imposed separate terms under section 667, subdivision (a) and section 667.5, subdivision (b) for the same prior conviction.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>(People </em>v. <em>Jones, supra, 5 </em>Cal.4th at p. 1145.) The Supreme Court held this was improper and ordered the one-year enhancement under section 667.5, subdivision (b) to be stricken. <em>(Jones, supra, </em>at p. 1153.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1064-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1700\">*1700</page-number>The court first reiterated its determination in <em>People </em>v. <em>Prather </em>(1990) 50 Cal.3d 428 [267 Cal.Rptr. 605, 787 P.2d 1012] that section 667.5, subdivision (b) \u201c \u2018merely provides a special sentence enhancement for that particular <em>subset of </em>\u201cprior felony convictions\u201d that were deemed serious enough ... to warrant actual imprisonment. . . .\u2019 \u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Jones, supra, 5 </em>Cal.4th at p. 1148; see <em>People </em>v. <em>Prather, supra, </em>50 Cal.3d at p. 440.) It then concluded that section 667, subdivision (a) and section 667.5, subdivision (b) apply to the same set of facts, that is, the underlying prior felony conviction. <em>(Jones, supra, </em>at p. 1149.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1064-4\">The court next decided that the electorate did not intend the two enhancements to be cumulatively imposed. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Jones, supra, 5 </em>Cal.4th at pp. 1149- 1150.) The court read subdivision (b) of section 667 to mean that \u201cwhen multiple statutory enhancement provisions are available for the same prior offense, one of which is a section 667 enhancement, the greatest enhancement, but only that one, will apply.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> **6 (5 Cal.4th at p. 1150.) In the court\u2019s estimation, any other construction of the statute would lead to peculiar results. For example, most prior \u201cviolent\u201d felonies under section 667.5 will also constitute \u201cserious\u201d felonies under section 667, subdivision (a). Thus, imposition of enhancement terms under both statutes would transform five-year enhancements into eight-year enhancements in most cases. The court reasoned that if the drafters of section 667 had intended to create such eight-year terms, they could have done so by repealing section 667.5 and providing for longer enhancements in section 667. <em>(Jones, supra, </em>at p. 1150.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1064-8\">In addition, the court pointed out that although the Legislature had amended sections 667 and 667.5 since passage of Proposition 8, it had not chosen to specify a cumulative term of imprisonment in either statute. On the other hand, subdivisions (a) and (b) of section 667.9 require imposition of a specified enhancement \u201cin addition to the sentence provided under Section 667.\u201d The court concluded: \u201cThe Legislature\u2019s use of sentencing language cumulative to section 667 in section 667.9 and its omission of such language in section 667.5 show an intent not to require enhancements under both sections 667 and 667.5.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Jones, supra, 5 </em>Cal.4th at pp. 1150- 1151, fn. 2.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1064-10\">The Supreme Court\u2019s analysis in <em>Jones </em>is germane and decisive in the instant case. First, section 667.6, subdivision (a) applies to a set of facts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1701\">*1701</page-number>included within the ambit of section 667. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Jones, supra, </em>5 Cal.4th at pp. 1148-1149; <em>People </em>v. <em>Jones, supra, </em>12 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1115-1116.) The triggering event under section 667.6, subdivision (a) is the defendant\u2019s \u201cprior conviction\u201d of one of those certain sexual felonies the Legislature has found egregious enough to warrant the prescribed additional punishment. As with subdivision (b) of section 667.5, then, section 667.6, subdivision (a) must \u201cnecessarily\u201d be a \u201clesser category\u201d of the \u201cprior felony convictions\u201d covered by the \u201cbroad mandate\u201d of article I, section 28, subdivision (f) of the California Constitution. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Prather, supra, </em>50 Cal.3d at p. 440; see also <em>People </em>v. <em>Jones, supra, </em>5 Cal.4th at pp. 1148-1149.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1065-5\">Second, in enacting section 667 when section 667.6 was already law, the voters undoubtedly did not intend the two enhancements to be cumulative. Nothing in the language of either statute carries a contrary suggestion. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Jones, supra, </em>12 Cal.App.4th at p. 1116.) Most, if not all, of the offenses listed in subdivision (a) of section 667.6 qualify as \u201cserious\u201d felonies under section 667.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Imposition of terms under both statutes would transform a five-year enhancement into a ten-year enhancement in many cases. If the drafters of section 667 had wanted this result, they could have achieved it by \u201crepealing [section 667.6] and providing for the longer enhancement in section 667.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Jones, supra, 5 </em>Cal.4th at p. 1150.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1065-6\">Finally, although the Legislature has amended section 667.6 a number of times since section 667 was enacted, it has \u201cnever chosen to specify a cumulative term of imprisonment as it did with section 667.9.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Jones, supra, </em>5 Cal.4th at p. 1151, fn. 2.) The Legislature\u2019s use of the phrase \u201cin addition to the sentence provided under Section 667\u201d in section 667.9, and the omission of such language from section 667.6, subdivision (a), reflects \u201can intent not to require enhancements under both sections 667 and [667.6, subdivision (a)].\u201d <em>(Jones, supra, </em>at p. 1151, fn. 2.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1066-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1702\">*1702</page-number>Because this is a case where \u201cmultiple statutory enhancement provisions are available for the same prior offense, one of which is a section 667 enhancement,\u201d only one may be imposed. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Jones, supra, </em>5 Cal.4th at p. 1150.) Section 1385, subdivision (b) prohibits the striking of \u201cany prior conviction of a serious felony for purposes of enhancement of a sentence under Section 667.\u201d Accordingly, we will order that the section 667.6, subdivision (a) enhancement be stricken. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Jones, supra, </em>5 Cal.4th at p. 1153; <em>People </em>v. <em>Jones, supra, </em>12 Cal.App.4th at p. 1117.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1066-4\">ii., in.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1066-5\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b1066-6\">The following are stricken from the judgment:</p>\n<p id=\"b1066-7\">1.
