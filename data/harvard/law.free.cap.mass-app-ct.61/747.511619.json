L. c. 32, \u00a7 8(2)(c) and <em>(b), </em>which covers the return to work by a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"748\">*748</page-number>public employee to the same \u201cposition from which he retired or a similar position within the same department,\u201d is to be construed to mean that the plaintiffs, certain troopers returning to the State police force after disability retirement, were entitled not only to the same position in rank and title previously held, but also to a higher pay grade and seniority credits, the level of which the troopers contend they would have achieved had there not been any intervening disability retirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-5\">The plaintiffs argue that G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 8(2)(a) and <em>(b) </em>(either standing alone, or when read in conjunction with a certain provision in the pension retirement laws), compels the conclusion that they should have been reinstated at a higher level of compensation and with greater seniority credits than they received. The defendant Department of State Police (department) counters that a collective bargaining agreement (CBA) between it and the State Police Association (union) controls the terms of the troopers\u2019 return to service, and that the phrases referring to \u201cposition\u201d in \u00a7 8(2)(a) and <em>(b)</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>were not intended by the Legislature, and cannot be construed, to override and displace the negotiated terms of reinstatement to the department as set forth in the CBA.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"749\">*749</page-number>A Superior Court judge allowed the defendant\u2019s motion for judgment on the pleadings. However, given the novel issue presented, pursuant to Mass.R.Civ.P. 64(a), as amended, 423 Mass. 1403 (1996), and G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 111, the judge reported questions to this court. We ascertain that the first of the reported questions is outcome determinative.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> That reported question was as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b783-4\">\u201c(1) G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 8 requires reinstated employees to be returned to the same or similar position from which they retired. Does G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 8 implicitly entitle state police officers returning from extended disability retirement to be reinstated at the same pay grade and level of seniority that they enjoyed at the time of their retirement? Or, is this a matter that is subject to negotiation and, thus, properly addressed in the collective bargaining agreement?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b783-5\">In answer to this question, we hold as follows: the terms of employment upon reinstatement under G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 8(2), may be governed by a collective bargaining agreement; G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 8(2), does not, either in its plain meaning or implicitly, entitle State troopers who are reinstated to the police force following disability retirement, to the same pay grade or level of seniority that they may have had at the time of their disability retirement; the subject CBA in effect at the time of the events in this case controls the terms of the plaintiffs\u2019 reinstatement with respect to such pay grade and level of seniority determination; and there is no conflict between the CBA and G. L. c. 150E, \u00a7 <em>7(d).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b783-6\">1. <em>Factual and procedural background. </em>The background facts set forth in the record may be summarized thusly. Each of the six plaintiffs was injured in the line of duty, was placed on disability retirement (from time to time also referred to as disability leave), and received disability retirement benefits pursuant to G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 7. After some passage of time, the plaintiffs applied for reinstatement to the State police force under G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 8(2)(a), and were found medically qualified for return to such service.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"750\">*750</page-number>During the periods of their disability retirements, each of the plaintiffs received disability retirement benefits based on achieving trooper first class status, with a step seven salary, prior to retirement. However, upon their return to work, the department\u2019s reading of the CBA was that the plaintiffs were to be reinstated as troopers (not troopers first class), with a corresponding salary level of trooper, step one. In addition to this rank classification and attendant salary step level, at reinstatement there was also an issue as to what seniority level applied to the troopers. The department read the CBA as requiring that the returning troopers\u2019 seniority began as of the date of their reinstatement. In effect, this meant that the troopers would not have sufficient seniority to bid for overtime and shift and barracks assignments because troopers with less than five years of seniority have no such rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-5\">The department rejected both the plaintiffs\u2019 claims of greater entitlement regarding salary and seniority under the CBA and the plaintiffs\u2019 claims that, to the extent that the CBA did not provide for a higher pay step and seniority, the CBA was overridden by G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 8(2)(a) and (b). The union filed for arbitration. In reviewing the CBA, the arbitrator reached a different determination than the department concerning the rank and title to which the plaintiffs were entitled upon reinstatement under the terms of the CBA. The arbitrator found that, as to five of the six plaintiffs (the plaintiff Thomas was the exception), the department had misinterpreted the CBA by ranking the returning officers as troopers, rather than as troopers first class. The arbitrator ordered that five of the plaintiffs be reinstated as troopers first class, step five.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> This salary step yields compensa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"751\">*751</page-number>tian of $903.91 per week. However, the arbitrator agreed with the department that, under the CBA, seniority was calculated as beginning as of the date of the plaintiffs\u2019 reinstatement.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Having reached these determinations under the CBA, the arbitrator declined to address the plaintiffs\u2019 statutorily-based argument, which is the issue presented in this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-5\">Following the arbitration decision, the plaintiffs filed a complaint in Superior Court seeking a declaratory judgment that G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 8(2)(a) and <em>(b), </em>required that the plaintiffs be restored to \u201cthe title, rank and pay grade of Trooper First Class, Step 7,\u201d and be credited with seniority \u201cas if they had never been involuntarily retired.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The complaint also sought an injunction ordering the plaintiffs\u2019 reinstatement to trooper first class, step 7, retroactive to the date of reinstatement, with corresponding retroactive back pay; the awarding of additional credits for seniority earned prior to their disability retirement, as well as for the respective periods that the plaintiffs were on disability leave; and the application of the increased seniority credits to all employment-related functions in the State police force, such as barracks assignments.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-6\">In granting the defendant judgment on the pleadings, the judge reasoned that because \u201cG. L. c. 32, \u00a7 8[(2)(a) and (b),] is silent on the matters of salary and/or seniority for reinstated State Police officers following involuntary disability retirement, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"752\">*752</page-number>there is no conflict[<footnotemark>8</footnotemark>] and the collective bargaining agreement governs.\u201d Then, as previously noted, the judge reported questions of law to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-4\">2. <em>Analysis. </em>The plaintiffs assert two different, but intertwined, legal theories to support the argument that, under G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 8, their salaries and seniority are to be increased. As previously noted, the first argument focuses on the phrase in \u00a7 8(2)(a) that references reinstatement following disability to the same \u201cposition from which [the public employee] retired or a similar position\u201d (for ease of reference, sometimes referred to herein as \u201cthe same or similar position\u201d). The second argument seeks to connect the language appearing in G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 8(2)(a) and <em>(b) </em>\u2014 particularly \u00a7 8(2)(b) which refers to the time of \u201ccreditable service\u201d in public employment (see note 3, supra) \u2014 to the provision in G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 26, which governs the calculation of pension retirement compensation. We address each of these legal theories <em>infra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b786-5\">a. <em>The reference to \u201cposition\u201d in G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 8(2)(a). </em>The plaintiffs argue that the plain meaning, legislative history, and spirit of the words referencing the same or similar \u201cposition\u201d in G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 8(2)(a), preserve greater employment rights than reinstatement to the same job, title, and rank in the State police. According to the plaintiffs\u2019 theory, \u201cposition\u201d in \u00a7 8(2)(a) incorporates all employment-related matters, including but not limited to salary steps, seniority, shift and bidding rights, and any other related benefits, and all of these are to be calculated under \u00a7 8(2)(a) \u201cas if they [the plaintiffs] had endured no break in service.\u201d According to the plaintiff\u2019s theory of statutory construction, with respect to any of the enhanced employment rights that are encompassed by the word \u201cposition\u201d in \u00a7 8(2)(a), the statute trumps and overrides any differing provisions of the negotiated CBA.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-6\">The black letter text of G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 8(2)(a) and <em>(b), </em>does not support the meaning that the plaintiffs would ascribe to it. Indeed, the statute\u2019s text does not reference salary and seniority at all. \u201cWhere the language of a statute is plain, it must be interpreted in accordance with the usual and natural meaning of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"753\">*753</page-number>the words.\u201d <em>Gurley </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>363 Mass. 595, 598 (1973). See generally <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rahim, </em>441 Mass. 273, 275 (2004). \u201c[A] statute must be interpreted according to the intent of the Legislature ascertained from all its words construed by the ordinary and approved usage of the language, considered in connection with the cause of its enactment, the mischief or imperfection to be remedied and the main object to be accomplished.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hinds, </em>437 Mass. 54, 63 (2002), cert, denied, 537 U.S. 1205 (2003), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>431 Mass. 417, 421 (2000). Here, the main legislative objective to be accomplished is the reinstatement of a public employee following disability retirement, to the same or similar position he or she previously held. In contrast, \u00a7 8(2)(a) does not, in its \u201cusual and ordinary meaning considered in light of the aim to be accomplished by the Legislature,\u201d appear directed to locking in a set salary or seniority credits in that reinstatement and, accordingly, does not state such terms or conditions. <em>Surrey </em>v. <em>Lumbermens Mut. Cas. Co., </em>384 Mass. 171, <em>177 </em>(1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b787-5\">It may be said that, in what is an indirect, but nonetheless telling, acknowledgment that the plain meaning the plaintiffs seek to discern is not actually present in the words of G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 8(2), the plaintiffs alternatively propose that \u00a7 8(2) \u201cimplicitly,\u201d or in its \u201cspirit,\u201d entitles them to the higher compensation and seniority levels they seek. By definition, something implicit is not present in the language of a statute. \u201c[T]he primary source of insight into the intent of the Legislature is the language of the statute.\u201d <em>International Fid. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Wilson, </em>387 Mass. 841, 853 (1983). Thus, this implicit or spirit of the law theory of statutory construction would have this court \u201cadd words to a statute that the Legislature did not put there, either by inadvertent omission or by design.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McLeod, </em>437 Mass. 286, 294 (2002). Accord <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Callahan, </em>440 Mass. 436, 443 (2003). This we cannot do. Where \u201cthe language of the statute is clear, it is the function of the judiciary to apply it, not amend it.\u201d <em>Commissioner of Rev. </em>v. <em>Cargill, Inc., </em>429 Mass. 79, 82 (1999). For this court to read \u00a7 8(2)(a) as incorporating the terms of employment the plaintiffs propose would be judicial amendment of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"754\">*754</page-number>Indeed, that the Legislature knew how to include language and words in a statute encompassing matters of salary, pay scale, and seniority when the Legislature intended these matters to be included is evident in other employment-related statutes, in which the Legislature has specifically and expressly stated that salary and seniority cannot be affected by a leave of absence. See, e.g., G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 105D; G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 52A.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Accordingly, the omission in G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 8, of terms concerning salary and seniority may be deemed to be one of deliberate Legislature design. \u201cSo important a matter would hardly have been passed over in silence.\u201d <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>308 Mass. 601, 613 (1941). If the Legislature had intended to impose such a profound set of requirements upon public employers, \u201cit could have said so simply and unambiguously.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ray, </em>435 Mass. 249, 257 n.15 (2001).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b788-5\">Finally, to support their reading of G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 8(2), the plaintiffs ask that we look at the legislative history and statutory development of this subsection. We need not do so. \u201cWhen the use of the ordinary meaning of a term yields a workable result, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"755\">*755</page-number>there is no need to resort to extrinsic aids such as legislative history.\u201d <em>Bronstein </em>v. <em>Prudential Ins. Co., </em>390 Mass. 701, 704 (1984). Accord <em>Leary </em>v. <em>Contributory Retirement Appeal Bd., </em>421 Mass. 344, 345-346 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b789-4\">Seniority and compensation are matters properly dealt with in the CBA, and the plaintiffs\u2019 rights under the CBA have already been determined in binding arbitration.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> This is in accord with \u201cthe Commonwealth\u2019s strong public policy favoring collective bargaining between the public employers and employees over the conditions and terms of employment.\u201d <em>School Comm. of Pittsfield </em>v. <em>United Educators of Pittsfield, </em>438 Mass. 753, 761-762 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b789-5\">b. <em>Pension retirement compensation under G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 26. </em>Posing a second theory of construction, the plaintiffs argue that the language referring to creditable years of service in G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 8(2)(b), is to be read as interconnected to G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 26, which governs the ultimate calculation of pension compensation upon retirement from public employment. The plaintiffs argue that construed together, the two laws must mean that the plaintiffs should have been reinstated at a higher rate of pay and with greater seniority credits because otherwise, the plaintiffs\u2019 pension retirement payments under \u00a7 26 potentially might be less than had no disability occurred. We reject the plaintiffs\u2019 strained reading of the two laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-6\">The plaintiffs\u2019 theory of interconnectivity does not flow because it relies on broken sentence fragments read in isolation, rather than in the appropriate foundational context. The words <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"756\">*756</page-number>cited by the plaintiffs in G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 8(2)(b) \u2014 that, upon returning to work following disability leave, the reinstated employee \u201cshall be entitled to a normal yearly amount of retirement allowance computed as though such disability retirement and reinstatement had not taken place\u201d \u2014 address the number of years of \u201ccreditable service\u201d to be deemed as belonging to the employee upon the date of reinstatement, and ensure that such employee does not lose count for any yearly amount of retirement allowance for prior creditable public service.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark>,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The preservation of the full count for these prior years is not directed at either salary or seniority in the future working years commencing with reinstatement. Nor is the \u201ctemporally related\u201d preservation of a full count of the prior years of creditable service directed at the numerics of the computation of ultimate pension compensation, which is predicated entirely on the average salary earned during a twelve month period preceding retirement.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> In sum, neither \u00a7 8(2)(b) nor \u00a7 26 says anything about salary following reinstatement during working years in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"757\">*757</page-number>public employment, or about conferring a specific award of seniority upon a reinstated employee for purposes of securing various on-the-job privileges \u2014 such as, in this case, for bidding on shifts and barracks assignments.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-4\">3. <em>Conclusion. </em>We answer the first reported question by holding that, in this case, the plaintiffs\u2019 salaries and seniority rights were governed by the CBA, and their rights concerning these terms of employment pursuant to that CBA were to be, and have been, determined in binding arbitration. We need not answer the remaining reported questions. The case is remanded to the Superior Court, where judgment shall enter for the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-5\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b782-6\">General Laws c. 32, \u00a7 8(2)(a), as amended by St. 1998, c. 252, \u00a7 2, provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b782-7\">\u201cIf, after two years of the date that a member [of a contributory retirement system] is retired [to disability leave], the regional medical panel determines that the retired member is qualified for and able to perform the essential duties <em>of the position from which he retired or a similar position within the same department, </em>as determined by the personnel administrator, <em>said member shall be returned to said position, provided the position is vacant\u201d </em>(emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b782-8\">General Laws c. 32, \u00a7 <em>8(2)(b), </em>as amended by St. 1996, c. 306, \u00a7 16, provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b782-9\">\u201cAny creditable service in effect for [a member of a contributory retirement system] at the time of his retirement for disability shall thereupon be restored to full force and effect [upon his return to work], and upon his subsequent retirement he shall be entitled to a normal yearly amount of retirement allowance computed as though such disability retirement and reinstatement had not taken place. No additional member contributions shall be required as a precondition of receiving such creditable service.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b783-7\">The question quoted in the text above was reported by the Superior Court judge. The plaintiffs requested that three additional questions be included in the report. Because the resolution of the first question is outcome determinative, we do not reach the other questions posed by the plaintiffs.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b784-6\">The basis for the arbitration determination that a step-up to trooper first class was required under the CBA was that the qualification for trooper first class was five years of service on the State police force and that five of the plaintiffs had met this qualification as of the date of their disability retirement. (The rank of trooper first class was created after certain of the plaintiffs had been placed on disability retirement). This was not true with respect to the plaintiff Thomas, who had worked only two years prior to his disability retirement, and the arbitrator, therefore, read the CBA as placing Thomas as trooper, step one.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b784-7\">Under the CBA, returning troopers are to be paid at the first step of the salary scale for the rank held prior to disability leave; step five is the first step of the trooper first class pay scale.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b785-7\">The higher salary step to which the plaintiffs claim they are entitled, i.e., trooper first class, step seven, yields compensation of $949.67 per week. As originally reinstated by the department as trooper, step one, the plaintiffs\u2019 salaries would have been $687.19 per week.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b785-8\">The defendant argues that the arbitrator\u2019s decision enforcing the CBA should be given preclusive effect so as to foreclose the claims asserted under G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 8, as well as to foreclose any legal effects of the statute on the plaintiffs\u2019 reinstatement. We need not address, as matter of law, whether the arbitrator\u2019s addressing the statutory challenge would have had any binding implication under principles of arbitration law or issue preclusion. The arbitrator expressly disavowed any determination on that issue, stating that he would \u201cmake no pronouncements with respect to the purpose of [G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 8,] or the intent of the statute or for that matter what the [Legislature meant by the term \u2018position\u2019 [in G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 8], These are issues that [the arbitrator] considered] beyond the scope of [his] arbitral authority and the scope of the contractual grievance.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b786-7\">This is a reference to the lack of conflict between the CBA and G. L. c. 150E, \u00a7 7(d). See note 11, <em>infra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b788-6\">General Laws c. 149, \u00a7 105D, as inserted by St. 1972, c. 790, \u00a7 1, which governs return to work following maternity leave, provides that upon return, a woman \u201cshall be restored to her previous, or a similar, position with the <em>same status, pay, length of service credit and seniority . . </em>.\u201d (emphasis added). Similarly, G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 52A, as inserted by St. 1956, c. 385, which governs return to work by military reservists on leave for military training, provides that such individuals shall \u201cbe restored to [their] previous, or a similar, position with the <em>same status, pay and seniority </em>. . .\u201d (emphasis added).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b788-7\">The plaintiffs cite <em>Carlson </em>v. <em>New Hampshire Dept, of Safety, </em>609 F.2d 1024 (1st. Cir. 1979), cert, denied, 446 U.S. 913 (1980), to support the argument that G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 8(2), includes the \u201cprivileges and incidents of a position.\u201d However, that case, which considered a quite different Federal statute, is not only inapposite, but rather serves to support the opposite conclusion, i.e., that the omission in \u00a7 8(a)(2)(a) and <em>(b) </em>is just that \u2014 a deliberate legislative determination. The Federal statute at issue in <em>Carlson </em>(the Veterans Readjustment Assistance Act, 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 2021[b][3] [1974]) provided that a reservist \u201cshall not be denied retention in employment or any promotion or <em>other incident or advantage of employment </em>because of any obligation as a member of a Reserve component of the Armed Forces\u201d (emphasis added). See <em>Carlson, supra </em>at 1026. Unlike the Federal statute at issue in <em>Carlson, </em>the subject State law, G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 <em>8(2)(a)-{b), </em>does not include any reference to other \u201cincident(s) or advantage(s) of employment.\u201d Indeed, the statute in <em>Carlson </em>is closer to the provisions of G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 52A, which has similar terms for public employee on leave for military training. See note 9, <em>supra, </em>and accompanying text.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b789-7\">The plaintiffs also cite G. L. c. 150E, \u00a7 <em>7(d), </em>which, in the context of public employment, prohibits negotiations of terms in a CBA that are in conflict with State laws, excepting only the statutes enumerated in \u00a7 <em>7(d). </em>General Laws c. 32, \u00a7 8, is not one of the enumerated statutes in \u00a7 <em>7(d) </em>of G. L. c. 150E, and hence, the plaintiffs argue, the State police CBA cannot override this State law. This argument is off the mark. There is no conflict between the CBA and G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 8(2)(a) and <em>(b) </em>\u2014 indeed, there theoretically could be such a conflict only if \u00a7 8(2) granted the salary and seniority rights which the plaintiffs would ascribe to it, a construction we reject.

L. c. 32, \u00a7 8(2)(b), preserves for the reinstated employee full credit, first, for the years that the employee worked prior to the disability retirement leave and, second, for the years between the initial retirement and the return to duty. The first of these purposes is achieved by the opening provision in \u00a7 <em>8(2)(b), </em>which provides that \u201c[a]ny creditable service in effect for [a returning employee] at the time of his retirement for disability shall thereupon be restored to full force and effect.\u201d The second purpose is achieved by the concluding segment of \u00a7 <em>8(2)(b), </em>and preserves the right of the returning employee to creditable service \u201cas though such disability retirement and reinstatement had not taken place.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b790-5\">The Legislature\u2019s purpose in G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 8(2)(b), in protecting creditable years of service fits in logically with the potential effects that may flow from the aggregation of such credited years of service on other benefits provided by G. L. c. 32, which are based upon and accrue only after a minimum number of years of creditable service. See, e.g., G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 5(1)(m) (ten years of creditable service required to be eligible for superannuation retirement allowance); G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 10(2)(b) (certain rights to apply for termination retirement accrue only after six or more years of creditable service).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b790-6\">General Laws c. 32, \u00a7 26(b)(ii), provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b790-7\">\u201c[Yearly payments shall be] equal to . . . seventy-two percent of the average annual rate of [a retiring employee\u2019s] regular compensation for the twelve month period for which he last received regular compensation immediately preceding the date his retirement allowance becomes effective. . . .\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
