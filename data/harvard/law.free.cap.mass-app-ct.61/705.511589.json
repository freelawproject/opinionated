(Garnet), appeals from the disposition of the parties\u2019 cross motions for summary judgment. At issue is whether Garnet is entitled to a declaratory judgment that Acadia Insurance Company (Acadia), which issued both workers\u2019 compensation and commercial general liability insurance policies to Garnet, had a duty to defend Garnet in an action brought by The Woodworks Architectural and Millwork, Inc. (Woodworks).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The motion judge ruled that Acadia did not have a duty to defend and, accordingly, entered judgment for Acadia.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"706\">*706</page-number>The underlying claims brought by Woodworks against Garnet arose from a construction site accident in which Robert Drover, a Garnet employee, was injured. Drover received benefits under Garnet\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation policy and also brought a suit for damages, under the authority of G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 15, against the general contractor, Shawmut Design and Construction Company, Inc. (Shawmut). In that suit, Shawmut filed a third-party complaint against Woodworks, one of its subcontractors, seeking express contractual indemnification, as well as damages for Woodworks\u2019 alleged failure to name Shawmut as an additional insured under Wordworks\u2019 liability insurance policy. Woodworks, in turn, brought a fourth-party complaint against Garnet, its installation subcontractor.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-5\">As originally filed, the fourth-party complaint alleged that Garnet was liable for contribution as a joint tortfeasor under G. L. c. 231B and for tort-based (common-law) indemnity on the theory that any liability of Woodworks was only derivative or vicarious of Garnet\u2019s wrongful acts. Later, Woodworks amended its fourth-party complaint to include a claim for \u201cimplied contractual indemnity,\u201d alleging that \u201c[t]he relationship between the parties is such\u201d that Garnet \u201chas an implied agreement to indemnify\u201d Woodworks. Garnet requested that Acadia provide it with a defense to the fourth-party action under either its workers\u2019 compensation policy or its commercial general liability policy. Acadia denied coverage under both insurance contracts, and this action ensued.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-6\">On appeal, Garnet no longer presses its contention that Acadia owed it a duty to defend under the workers\u2019 compensation policy \u2014 a position that is at odds with the Supreme Judicial Court\u2019s decision in <em>HDH Corp. </em>v. <em>Atlantic Charter Ins. Co., </em>425 Mass. 433, 436-437 (1997). We are asked to consider only whether Acadia was required to defend the fourth-party action under the terms of the commercial general liability policy issued to Garnet.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-7\">There is no dispute that Woodworks\u2019 claims against Garnet were of questionable merit. See <em>Liberty Mut. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Westerlind, </em>374 Mass. 524, 526-527 (1978); <em>Larkin </em>v. <em>Ralph O. Porter, Inc., </em>405 Mass. 179, 182 &amp; n.3 (1989); <em>Fall River Hous. Authy. </em>v. <em>H. V. Collins Co., </em>414 Mass. 10, 14-15 (1992). Nevertheless, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"707\">*707</page-number>Acadia\u2019s duty to defend extended even to dubious claims. See <em>Wolov </em>v. <em>Michaud Bus Lines, Inc., </em>21 Mass. App. Ct. 60, 65 (1985). Irrespective of the weakness of the underlying complaint, an insurer must undertake to defend its insured \u201cif the allegations are \u2018reasonably susceptible\u2019 of an interpretation that they state or adumbrate a claim covered by the policy terms.\u201d <em>Sterilite Corp. </em>v. <em>Continental Casualty Co., </em>17 Mass. App. Ct. 316, 318 (1983), quoting from <em>Vappi &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>Aetna Cas. &amp; Sur. Co., </em>348 Mass. 427, 431 (1965). We therefore examine the claims asserted in the amended fourth-party complaint with reference to the relevant portions of the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-5\">The pivotal policy provision is the employer\u2019s liability \u201cExclusions,\u201d which reads as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b741-6\">\u201cThis insurance does not apply to:</p>\n<p id=\"b741-7\">\u201ce. Employer\u2019s Liability</p>\n<p id=\"b741-8\">\u2018Bodily injury\u2019 to:</p>\n<p id=\"b741-9\">(1) An \u2018employee\u2019 of the insured arising out of and in the course of:</p>\n<p id=\"b741-10\">(a) Employment by the insured; or</p>\n<p id=\"b741-11\">(b) Performing duties related to the conduct of the insured\u2019s business;</p>\n<p id=\"b741-12\">\u201cThis exclusion applies:</p>\n<p id=\"b741-13\">(1) Whether the insured may be liable as an employer or in any other capacity; and</p>\n<p id=\"b741-14\">(2) To any obligation to share damages with or repay someone else who must pay damages because of the injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-15\">\u201cThis exclusion does not apply to liability assumed by the insured under an <em>\u2018insured contract </em>\u201d (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b741-17\">The term \u201cinsured contract\u201d is defined in the policy in relevant part to mean:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b742-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number>\u201cThat part of any other contract or agreement pertaining to your business . . . under which you assume the tort liability of another party to pay for \u2018bodily injury\u2019 or \u2018property damage\u2019 to a third person or organization. Tort liability means a liability that would be imposed by law in the absence of any contract or agreement.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b742-5\">Garnet does not dispute that, because Drover was its employee, the employer\u2019s liability exclusion is applicable, and Acadia would be obliged to defend only if the fourth-party complaint could be said to raise a claim of liability assumed under an \u201cinsured contract,\u201d thereby triggering the exception to the exclusion. Garnet also does not dispute that Woodworks\u2019 claims for contribution and tort-based indemnity do not fall within the exception. It points only to Woodworks\u2019 claim for implied contractual indemnity, emphasizing that the definition of \u201cinsured contract\u201d does not, on its face, require that the insured\u2019s assumption of another\u2019s tort liability be express or in writing. Acadia, on the other hand, argues that the definition of \u201cinsured contract\u201d requires that the insured\u2019s indemnity obligation be expressly assumed in the parties\u2019 contract and not simply implied from the parties\u2019 relationship. According to Acadia, any broader reading of the exception to the exclusion would conflict with the \u201cmanifest design of the policy\u201d to exclude claims arising from injuries to the insured\u2019s employees except in extremely limited circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-6\">We think that the policy language unambiguously supports Acadia\u2019s interpretation. As defined, an \u201cinsured contract\u201d must be <em>\u201cpart of\u2019 </em>another contract or agreement pertaining to the insured\u2019s business \u2014 in other words, it must be a term of the business arrangements between the parties. Furthermore, pursu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"709\">*709</page-number>ant to this contract term, the insured must <em>\u201cassume </em>the tort liability of another\u201d \u2014 that is, it must affirmatively undertake an indemnity obligation to the other party. See <em>Truck Ins. Exchange </em>v. <em>BRE Properties, Inc., </em>119 Wash. App. 582, 592-596 (2003) (applying \u201cinsured contract\u201d exception where general contractor\u2019s tort liability for injury suffered by third party was expressly transferred by agreement to insured subcontractor). Even if we accept that the policy does not require the contract to be in writing, the parties nevertheless had to reach an explicit agreement that the insured would hold the other party harmless for its tort liability. See <em>John Deere Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>De Smet Ins. Co. of South Dakota, </em>650 N.W.2d 601, 606-607 (Iowa 2002) (exception applied based upon express oral agreement to indemnify). See also <em>Sanders </em>v. <em>Ashland Oil, Inc., </em>656 So. 2d 643, 649-650 (La. App. 1995) (exception not applied where written contract provided for indemnification only in the context of a performance bond and not expressly for tort liability).</p>\n<p id=\"b743-5\">Here, the fourth-party complaint did not assert a claim based upon any explicit term in the contract between Woodworks and Garnet; nor did it assert that Garnet affirmatively undertook to indemnify Woodworks. Instead, it alleged an implied indemnity obligation derived solely from the parties\u2019 relationship as contractor and subcontractor. Indeed, Garnet itself characterized the amended fourth-party complaint in this fashion when it tendered its defense to Acadia. In two letters that are attached as exhibits to its complaint for declaratory judgment, Garnet acknowledged and emphasized that Woodworks\u2019 implied contractual indemnity claim was <em>not </em>contractually based, stating that \u201cthe alleged implied liability arises from the purported relationship of the parties, and not based on any purported liability assumed under a contract\u201d and that, \u201c[a]s you know, the relationship between Woodworks and Garnet was that of contractor and subcontractor. It is that relationship and not a claim based on breach of any contract, that forms the basis of Woodworks\u2019 implied indemnity claim against your insured.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b743-6\">Later, Garnet took a different tack, arguing before the motion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"710\">*710</page-number>judge that the amended fourth-party complaint could be interpreted as raising an express contractual indemnity claim. In making that argument, Garnet noted that there was a provision in the written contract between it and Woodworks whereby Garnet agreed to \u201c[gjeneral conditions of building and owners\u2019 requirements.\u201d Garnet argued that this clause, when read together with the contract between the owner and the general contractor, constituted an express agreement to indemnify Woodworks.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-5\">This argument does not appear to be pressed on appeal<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>; but even if we were to consider it, we agree with the motion judge that the language in the subcontract is not sufficiently explicit to incorporate any indemnification provision contained in the contract between the owner and the general contractor and that, therefore, there was no express contract of indemnity between Garnet and Woodworks. Compare <em>Whittle </em>v. <em>Pagani Bros. Constr. Co., </em>383 Mass. 796, 799 (1981). In any event, the allegations of the amended fourth-party complaint are not susceptible of the interpretation that Woodworks\u2019 claim was one for express contractual indemnity.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-6\">In short, because the claims alleged in Woodworks\u2019 complaint did not fall within the \u201cinsured contract\u201d exception to the employers\u2019 liability exclusion, the allowance of Acadia\u2019s motion for summary judgment and the denial of Garnet\u2019s cross motion for summary judgment was correct. The declaratory judgment ordering and declaring that Acadia owed no duty to defend Garnet under its commercial liability policy is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b739-16\">On the assumption that Acadia had a duty to defend, Garnet also claimed damages for breach of contract and violation of G. L. c. 93A.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b742-7\">This definition also plays a role in determining the scope of the policy\u2019s coverage for contractual liability. Absent a contractual liability endorsement, the policy\u2019s \u201cContractual Liability\u201d exclusion precludes coverage for \u201c \u2018Bodily injury\u2019 or \u2018property damage\u2019 for which the insured is obligated to pay damages by reason of the assumption of liability in a contract or agreement.\u201d Again, however, there is an exception for \u201cinsured contracts.\u201d The exclusion does not apply to liability for damages \u201c[a]ssumed in a contract or agreement that is an \u2018insured contract\u2019, provided the \u2018bodily injury\u2019 or \u2018property damage\u2019 occurs subsequent to the execution of the contract or agreement.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b743-7\">Gamet took this position in support of its now-abandoned claim for coverage under its workers\u2019 compensation policy, which contained a broadly worded contractual liability exclusion with no exception for an \u201cinsured contract.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b744-8\">The various contract provisions are quoted in Garnet\u2019s statement of facts, but the brief contains no substantive argument on the issue. See Mass.R.A.P. 16(a)(4), as amended, 367 Mass. 921 (1975).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
