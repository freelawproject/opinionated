We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-14\">In a well-reasoned opinion, the judge first determined that the circumstances were closer to those set forth in <em>Cabot </em>v. <em>Cabot, </em>55 Mass. App. Ct. 756 (2002), rather than those of <em>McCarthy </em>v. <em>McCarthy, </em>36 Mass. App. Ct. 490 (1994), cases involving separation agreements which were silent, as is the one at bar, on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>the issue of college education. Since the children were five and two years old at the time of the agreement, the failure of the parents to address the issue of college expenses could, the judge stated, \u201cfairly be attributed to the young age of the children [as in <em>Cabot], </em>as opposed to a mutual decision not to obligate themselves.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Accordingly, he concluded, correctly, that the agreement was not fully integrated<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and that, absent other considerations,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> modification would be warranted on a showing of a material change in circumstances.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b397-5\">The judge determined that even if modification would otherwise be warranted, he nevertheless denied contribution, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>relying on G. L. c. 119A, \u00a7 13(a), set forth in the margin,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and also denied relief as a matter of discretion. The statutory provision, c. 119A, \u00a7 13(a), which does not distinguish between reductions or increases in support orders, see <em>Smith-Clarke </em>v. <em>Clarke, </em>44 Mass. App. Ct. 404, 405 n.2, 406 (1998), precludes retroactive modification of \u201cany child support order\u201d except for a period \u201cduring which there is pending a complaint for modification.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b398-4\">Contrary to the mother\u2019s contention that college expenses are not support and hence do not affect the previous support orders, the judge considered that such college expenses may be considered a component of child support and thus fall within the prohibition of the statute in this case. Although our cases have not addressed the issue whether an order to pay the cost of education is an order modifying a previous support order for purposes of c. 119A, \u00a7 13(a),<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> payment of such expenses is a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>component of a child\u2019s needs and is often covered by support orders or orders in the nature of support orders.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-5\">We need not decide the difficult question whether the judge was precluded by G. L. c. 119A, \u00a7 13(a), from entering an order, because he also declined to do so as a matter of discretion. In the Probate Court the mother argued, as she argues on appeal, that in <em>Hamilton </em>v. <em>Pappalardo, </em>42 Mass. App. Ct. 471 (1997), we permitted such retroactive payments under the equity jurisdiction of the Probate Court pursuant to G. L. c. 215, \u00a7 6. The judge, here, in denying relief in the \u201cexercise of [his] discretion,\u201d pointed to the factual distinctions between the present case and <em>Hamilton </em>v. <em>Pappalardo, supra, </em>in which the parties in their separation agreement expressly omitted making provisions for educational needs knowing that their son had developmental problems and specifically referred to judicial resolution of the issue.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b399-6\">Where, as here, an agreement is silent as to college expenses and modification was not sought while the child was in college, exceptional circumstances would be required for the issuance of a discretionary court order imposing liability.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The judge considered that in fairness (as well as by reason of G. L. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>c. 119A, \u00a7 13[a]), a party should not be able, in the absence of exceptional circumstances, to wait until after a child graduates to seek judicial modification of the agreement.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b400-4\">In declining relief, the judge stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b400-5\">\u201cOn the facts evident in the present case, the Mother took no steps to seek a contribution for the daughter\u2019s college expenses until after graduation. Her reasons for delay are not apparent from the evidence presented. An <em>ex post facto </em>[emphasis original] claim for college expenses with no prior notice to the Father may have dissuaded him in becoming involved in the college decision making process or seeking additional financial aid. Absent a persuasive reason why no claim was made until after graduation, this Court will not consider whether or not its equitable powers extend to granting the Mother\u2019s request for relief despite the provisions of G. L. c. 119A, \u00a7 13(a).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b400-6\">The judge properly denied relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-7\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b396-15\">Prior to trial the parties resolved all other issues, including contribution by the father to future college expenses of their son at Princeton University.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b397-6\">As noted in <em>Cabot </em>v. <em>Cabot, </em>55 Mass. App. Ct. at 766, the postponement of the issue of college costs is consistent with the \u201cgeneral rule [that] support orders regarding the future payment of post-high school educational costs are premature and should not be made.\u201d <em>Passemato </em>v. <em>Passemato, </em>427 Mass. 52, 54 (1998). <em>L.W.K. </em>v. <em>E.R.C., </em>432 Mass. 438, 452 (2000). <em>Lang </em>v. <em>Koon, ante </em>22, 25 (2004). Since judges will not normally require a parent to pay such expenses prior to a child attaining the age of eighteen, see <em>L.W.K. </em>v. <em>E.R.C., supra </em>at 453, it is not surprising that the parent likely to be charged with such costs frequently will not willingly assume such obligations and, as a result, separation agreements will often be silent on this matter.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b397-7\">The only provision relating to education states that \u201cthe [h]usband shall have the right to attend each child\u2019s parent-teacher nights\u201d to discuss the child\u2019s educational progress with the teacher. The wife also agreed to provide the husband with all written reports concerning the children\u2019s academic and social progress.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-8\">The agreement also provided: \u201cThis Agreement represents the entire understanding between the parties. This Agreement may not be modified except by an instrument in writing, executed by each of the parties.\u201d The agreement was to survive the divorce decree and continue in frill force and effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-9\">The judge noted that G. L. c. 208, \u00a7 28, permits a judge to modify surviving provisions of a separation agreement concerning child support \u201cnotwithstanding an agreement of the parents that has independent legal significance.\u201d In <em>McCarthy </em>v. <em>McCarthy, </em>36 Mass. App. Ct. at 493 n.5, we recognized that St. 1993, c. 460, \u00a7\u00a7 61 and 66, adding the above quoted language to G. L. c. 208, \u00a7 28, and G. L. c. 209, \u00a7 37, \u201cdiluted substantially the independence of agreements of parents that have independent legal significance.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b397-10\">See note 9, <em>infra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b397-11\">The judge pointed out that in <em>Cabot </em>v. <em>Cabot, supra </em>at 765, there was a change in circumstances justifying modification of a separation agreement that was silent on college expenses where \u201cone of the children had reached college age, and both wanted to attend college and were preparing to do so . . . .\u201d The showing of more than such a material change was not needed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b398-5\">General Laws c. 119A, \u00a7 13(a), as amended through St. 1998, c. 64, \u00a7 161, in relevant parts provides: \u201c(a) Any payment or installment of support under any child support order issued by any court of this commonwealth . . . shall be on or after the date it is due, a judgment by operation of law, with the full force, effect, and attributes of a judgment of this commonwealth including the ability to be enforced; shall be entitled as a judgment to full faith and credit; and a judicial or administrative action to enforce said judgment may be commenced at any time; <em>provided that said judgment shall not be subject to retroactive modification except with respect to any period during which there is pending a complaint for modification, but only from the date that notice of such complaint has been given, </em>either directly or through the appropriate agent, to the obligee or, where the obligee is the plaintiff, to the obligor.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b398-6\">In other circumstances, our cases often suggest that education is part of support. See, e.g., <em>Passemato </em>v. <em>Passemato, </em>427 Mass, at 57 (college educational trust fund \u201cin the nature of\u201d order for future child support); <em>Tavema </em>v. <em>Pizzi, </em>430 Mass. 882, 886 (2000) (order as to college education fund referred to as support obligation); <em>L.W.K. </em>v. <em>E.R.C., </em>432 Mass. 438, 452, 453 (2000) (Legislature has provided that parents in some circumstances have obligation to provide \u201ceducational support\u201d for children who have reached age of eighteen, but also noting that statute places limitation on \u201ceducational support awards\u201d after eighteen and \u201cdoes not limit general support awards for children under the age of eighteen\u201d); <em>Eccleston </em>v. <em>Bankosky, </em>438 Mass. 428, 434-437 (2003) (generally, children of nonintact families may receive postminority support for education); <em>Kirwood </em>v. <em>Kirwood, </em>27 Mass. App. Ct. 1156, 1157 (1989) (statute does not require consideration of educational expenses separately from support and maintenance obligations); <em>Lang </em>v. <em>Koon, ante </em>22, 25 (2004) (upward modification of child support for future college expenses <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>premature due to children\u2019s ages). Sometimes, however, our cases treat education as separate from support. See, e.g., <em>Rosenberg </em>v. <em>Merida, </em>428 Mass. 182, 190 (1998) (noting that divorce judgment did not state how much of an attachment was intended to secure child support obligation and how much to secure potential college expenses); <em>Cabot </em>v. <em>Cabot, </em>55 Mass. App. Ct. at 762 n.9 (court authorized to make orders \u201cbeyond support\u201d for education).</p>\n<p id=\"b399-13\">In this case the record is silent whether the costs claimed by the mother include payments for room and board as well as payments for tuition.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b399-14\">In <em>Hamilton </em>v. <em>Pappalardo, </em>42 Mass. App. Ct. at 477, the mother did not inform the father of her decisions. Significantly, we stated that the judge on remand could take into account \u201cthe extent to which [the father] unjustifiably may have been excluded from the decision-making process relating to [the son\u2019s] education.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b399-15\">Although the parties do not cite to G. L. c. 208, \u00a7 28, that statute only authorizes the following orders for children who have attained the age of eighteen.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b399-16\">\u201cThe court may make appropriate orders of maintenance, support and education of any child who has attained age eighteen but who has not attained age twenty-one and who is domiciled in the home of a parent, and is principally dependent upon said parent for maintenance. The court may make appropriate orders of maintenance, support and education for any child who has attained age twenty-one but who has not at<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>tained age twenty-three, if such child is domiciled in the home of a parent, and is principally dependent upon said parent for maintenance due to the enrollment of such child in an education program, excluding education costs beyond an undergraduate degree.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b400-9\">See <em>L.W.K. </em>v E.R.C., 432 Mass, at 453; <em>Larson </em>v. <em>Larson, </em>30 Mass. App. Ct. 418, 425 (1991); <em>Heider </em>v. <em>Heider, </em>34 Mass. App. Ct. 634, 636 (1993).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b400-11\">In her brief and in her reply brief, the mother states that she sought payment from the father during the daughter\u2019s college years and that he bullied her into not filing her complaint earlier. The record does not contain any evidence to support this claim, nor do we suggest that it would be sufficient to warrant her request for modification.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
