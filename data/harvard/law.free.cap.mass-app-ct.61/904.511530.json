An abuse prevention order issued on July 19, 2000, and was extended until August 1, 2001. The mother agreed to modify the order so that contact for the purpose of arranging visitation would not be a violation of the order. After genetic testing sought by the father indicated that the probability of paternity was greater than ninety-nine percent, the parties acknowledged paternity. On April 17, 2001 (inadvertently described in the findings as 2000), a temporary order issued permitting the father to continue to have three two-hour visits per week and requiring him forthwith to attend and complete an anger management program. The order required the visits to be supervised until the father enrolled and completed the anger management program and also required his brother-in-law or his sister to be present at the time of the picking up and dropping off of the child. If the father were more than ten minutes late, all visits subsequent were to be supervised.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-13\">The father completed an anger management program, and on August 14, 2001, the parties entered into a stipulation, made an order of the court, provid<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"905\">*905</page-number>ing for specified hours of visitation,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> for vacating of the abuse prevention order, and for child support. On February 2, 2002, the parties entered into another stipulation, also made an order of the court (inadvertently described in the judge\u2019s findings as issued in 2001), which increased visitation to include overnight visits on alternate weekends.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-5\">The judge stated that the parties, in a stipulation on the date of trial, agreed on all issues except the issue of legal custody and Christmas visitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-6\">The judge also found that the parties had established a suitable parenting plan addressing the child\u2019s medical needs<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> as well as a reasonable visitation schedule. He found the father \u201cis capable of caring for [the child] as well as making major decisions concerning her well-being, and there is no evidence ... to suggest that he is an unfit parent.\u201d The judge also stated that the parties do not have any fundamental differences in the major areas of child rearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-7\">The following finding is the primary focus of this appeal.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b901-8\">\u201c17. Despite limited communication and differences between the parties, they have not demonstrated an inability to communicate and cooperate concerning major decisions affecting [the child].\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b901-9\">The statute permitting joint custody, G. L. c. 209C, \u00a7 10(a), as inserted by St. 1986, c. 310, \u00a7 16, provides, in relevant part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b901-10\">\u201cIn awarding the parents joint custody, the court shall do so <em>only </em>if the parents have entered into an agreement pursuant to section eleven or the court finds that the parents have successfully exercised joint responsibility for the child prior to the commencement of proceedings pursuant to this chapter and have the ability to communicate and plan with each other concerning the child\u2019s best interests\u201d (emphasis supplied).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b901-11\">There is no agreement as to joint custody. The mother\u2019s testimony sets forth serious problems between the parties. The father\u2019s testimony indicates that the mother \u201chad kicked me in and out so many times\u201d and that \u201cthere was definitely tension\u201d between them. When asked why he was reluctant to have a significant amount of communication with the mother, the father answered that it was a result of the restraining order. \u201cI don\u2019t want to leave myself vulnerable to have another false accusation . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b901-12\">In view of the evidence from both the mother and the father indicating limited communication and differences, a matter also found by the judge, we consider that the statute requires more than a finding that the parties have \u201cnot demonstrated an inability to communicate and cooperate concerning major decisions affecting [the child].\u201d To support an award of joint custody the statute requires a positive finding that they have such an ability.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-13\">In the absence of such a finding, and in light of the evidence which strongly suggests that there is hostility between the parties, see <em>R.H. </em>v. <em>B.F., </em>39 Mass. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"906\">*906</page-number>App. Ct. 29, 43 (1995), <em>S.C. </em>sub nom. <em>Custody of </em>Vaughn, 422 Mass. 590 (1996), we consider it necessary to remand the matter to the Probate and Family Court to determine whether the evidence permits such a positive finding. The judge in his discretion may hear additional evidence.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"b902-6\">The case was submitted on briefs.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"AKje\"><em>Jar\u00e1s E.
