Tavares and Loraine Tavares, each appeal from their convictions of four indictments for mayhem (G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 14), six indictments for assault and battery causing bodily injury to a child (G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 13J[b][1]), one indictment for assault and battery by means of a dangerous weapon (G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 15A[b]), and two indictments for assault and battery (G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 13A).</p>\n<p id=\"b420-11\">On appeal, the defendants argue that (1) the judge erred when she denied the defendants\u2019 motions for required findings of not guilty on every indictment because the Commonwealth failed to prove the required elements of joint venture; (2) indictments 103617 and 103634 for mayhem caused by injury to fingernails by a needle-like object should have been dismissed because the injury was not proved to be serious or permanent; (3) indictments 103616 and 103633 for mayhem caused by a substance in the eyes were wrongly submitted to the jury on a theory of mayhem unsupported by the evidence; and (4) the judge erred when she allowed a conviction to enter on indictments 103620 and 103637 (assault and battery causing bodily injury to a child) after the jury returned guilty verdicts on a theory of guilt not submitted to them.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-12\"><em>Background. </em>Viewed in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Latimore, </em>378 Mass. 671, 676-677 (1979), the jury would have been warranted in finding the following. Theresa Campanale asked her sister and her brother-in-law, Loraine and Darrell Tavares, to take care of her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>then four year old son, Jack, and his younger sister Janet.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The defendants picked up Jack and Janet in May, 2000, from Campanale\u2019s apartment in Lawrence; at that time the children were completely well and had no noticeable injuries. Jack and his sister stayed with the defendants in unit seven of the Pilgrim Motel in Norwell. Unit seven was small; it contained sufficient space for a double bed, and a table and chairs; there was a full bathroom and an alcove for cooking. Jack and Janet stayed with the defendants for several weeks. The manager of the Pilgrim Motel testified she saw the two children at the motel, and also that she heard Darrell Tavares shouting angrily. A neighbor who lived in a unit that adjoined the defendants\u2019 unit testified that she heard screaming, crying, and yelling from children after 11:30 p.m.; she heard Darrell Tavares yelling \u201cshut the fuck up or else I\u2019m going to hit you,\u201d and afterwards she heard children crying.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-5\">Anthony Chavis, brother of Theresa Campanale and the defendant Loraine Tavares, saw Jack on three occasions while Jack was living with the defendants. During his first visit, Chavis observed no injuries on Jack. During his second visit, Chavis observed that Jack\u2019s eyes were blue, although his natural eye color was brown. During Chavis\u2019s third visit, he observed that Jack had a cut on his head, his lips were swollen, his eyes were still blue, and he had trouble keeping them open. During this last visit, Jack urinated on himself during dinner. According to Chavis, Loraine said to Darrell, \u201ctake care of that\u201d; Darrell grabbed Jack by the arm, held him in the air, and hit him with a construction belt on his buttocks two or three times. The next day when Chavis returned from shooting a BB gun with Darrell, he observed that Jack had a fresh cut on his head and his shirt was soaking wet.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-6\">The defendants, accompanied by Chavis, returned Jack and Janet to Campanale on June 12, 2000. Campanale testified to the following. Jack looked sick and thin. His cheek was bruised and his lip swollen and split open. His head had deep cuts and his eyes were blue and cloudy. Jack\u2019s body was covered in bruises, his elbow and fingers were swollen, and he had an open wound on his penis. Campanale took Jack to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>emergency room at Lawrence General Hospital the morning of June. 13, 2000. Jack was transferred to Children\u2019s Hospital in Boston where he remained for fifteen days in order to receive treatment. On June 14, 2000, at Children\u2019s Hospital, Jack was examined by Dr. Alice Newton, the medical director of the child protection team at Massachusetts General Hospital, who subsequently testified at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-5\"><em>Joint venture. </em>We review the judge\u2019s denial of the defendants\u2019 motions for required findings of not guilty, considering only the evidence presented in the Commonwealth\u2019s case. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Berry, </em>431 Mass. 326, 331 (2000). We assess whether a joint venture theory was warranted by the evidence presented. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b422-6\">The defendants argue that the Commonwealth did not prove the elements of joint venture under either of the two recognized theories. A joint venturer, under the first theory, \u201caids, commands, counsels, or encourages commission of a crime while sharing with the principal the mental state required for the crime.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Soares, </em>377 Mass. 461, 470, cert, denied, 444 U.S. 881 (1979). In order to be held liable as a joint venturer on this first theory, it must be shown \u201cthat the defendant was \u2018(1) present at the scene of the crime, (2) with knowledge that another intends to commit the crime or with intent to commit [the] crime, and (3) by agreement is willing and available to help the other if necessary.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Carroll, </em>439 Mass. 547, 553 (2003), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bianco, </em>388 Mass. 358, 366, <em>S.C., </em>390 Mass. 254 (1983). A defendant need not be at the scene of a crime throughout its occurrence in order to be found a joint venturer. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sim, </em>39 Mass. App. Ct. 212, 217 (1995). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lafayette, </em>40 Mass. App. Ct. 534, 537 (1996). One may be considered \u201cpresent\u201d for purposes of joint venture even if only \u201cin the vicinity of the crime.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kilburn, </em>426 Mass. 31, 34 n.5 (1997), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mahoney, </em>405 Mass. 326; 329 (1989). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Echavarria, </em>428 Mass. 593, 598 n.3 (1998). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rock, </em>429 Mass. 609, 617-618 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b422-7\">A second theory provides that a defendant may be a joint venturer if she or he \u201csomehow participated in committing the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>offense, by counseling, hiring or otherwise procuring the principal, [or] by agreeing to stand by, at, or near the scene to render aid, assistance or encouragement.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Amaral, </em>13 Mass. App. Ct. 238, 242 (1982). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ortiz, </em>424 Mass. 853, 856 (1997). Under this second theory, a defendant may be liable if he or she participated in the venture and \u201csought to make it succeed.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Amaral, </em>13 Mass. App. Ct. at 242.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-5\">The defendants argue that the Commonwealth was unsuccessful in proving joint venture under either theory because it did not prove presence at the scene of the relevant injuries, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bianco, </em>388 Mass, at 366, nor did it prove the defendants counseled, hired, or otherwise procured the crime to be committed. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Caramanica, </em>49 Mass. App. Ct. 376, 381 (2000). Although the two joint venture theories differ (\u201c[t]he point of difference ... is the factor of the defendant\u2019s presence at the scene of the felony\u201d), the Supreme Judicial Court has noted that \u201cdecisions have spoken of the two theories interchangeably.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ortiz, </em>424 Mass, at 856. In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Caramanica, </em>49 Mass. App. Ct. at 381, we observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b423-6\">\u201cAdmittedly, the case law over the years has muddled the issue. Although something of an oversimplification, presence is <em>not </em>required where a defendant actually \u2018aids or abets\u2019 in the commission of a crime . . . but presence generally <em>is </em>required where a conviction is sought on the basis that a defendant \u2018shared\u2019 the principal\u2019s criminal intent (i.e., \u2018mental state\u2019), and may have merely stood by, but by agreement was ready to assist if necessary\u201d (emphasis in original).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b423-7\">Following <em>Caramanica, </em>we wrote in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Batista, </em>53 Mass. App. Ct. 642, 646 (2002), \u201c[u]nder either theory of joint venture, the critical question is whether the defendant acted with knowledge of the [crime] and with the intent to assist in the commission of that crime so as to accomplish its objective.\u201d In order to succeed on a joint venture theory, the Commonwealth is not required to prove the identity of the actual perpetrator. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Netto, </em>438 Mass. 686, 700-701 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b424-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>In this case, the judge instructed the jury as to both theories of joint venture. Each defendant argues that there was no proof that he or she was present at the scene when injuries were inflicted. The defendants further argue that although the number of Jack\u2019s injuries permit an inference that the defendants would eventually have had to become aware of his physical abuse, that inference is insufficient to establish either the \u201cpresence\u201d of either defendant or their participation. To support a conviction on the basis of joint venture, \u201c[t]he inferences drawn by the jury need only be reasonable and possible and need not be necessary or inescapable.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Stokes, </em>440 Mass. 741, 745 (2004), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Brooks, </em>422 Mass. 574, 577 (1996). At the close of the Commonwealth\u2019s case, the evidence was sufficient to permit the jury reasonably to infer the existence of a joint venture under either theory.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-4\">Newton testified that all of Jack\u2019s injuries occurred within two weeks of the time that she examined him. Darrell and Loraine had custody of the two children for the relevant time period, and no one else cared for the children during that time. Chavis witnessed Loraine tell Darrell to \u201ctake care of that\u201d and then observed Darrell grab Jack and hit him with a construction belt on his buttocks in Loraine\u2019s presence. Chavis also observed the accumulation of physical injury to Jack during the time that the child was in Darrell\u2019s and Loraine\u2019s custody. A reasonable jury could have concluded that the defendants, having had exclusive physical custody of Jack during the time that he was injured, and living in a small motel room in which both defendants were present for at least one incident of abuse, were participants in the offenses, counseled one another, and agreed to stand by or near the scene, or were present during the abuse. A reasonable jury could also have found that each defendant was present with knowledge of the other\u2019s intent to commit the crime, and that they shared that intent. Accordingly, it was reasonable for the jury to have found that the defendants were joint venturers. The judge did not err in denying the defendants\u2019 motions for required findings of not guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-5\"><em>Fingernails. </em>The defendants argue that the injury to Jack\u2019s fingernails was not proved to be serious or permanent within the meaning of the second branch of the mayhem statute, G. L. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>c. 265, \u00a7 14.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Newton testified that at the time of her examination, Jack\u2019s fingers were swollen and had tiny bruises underneath his fingernails caused by a sharp object, such as a needle, having been intentionally stuck under his fingernails.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Underneath each fingernail was a tiny line of bruising extending from the front of the finger underneath the nail bed. Newton testified that the injury to Jack\u2019s fingernails would have been \u201cvery painful\u201d; she further testified that based upon her experience treating children it would likely have involved a struggle. Newton did not reexamine Jack\u2019s fingernails at the time of trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-5\">We have held that where a defendant rubbed handfuls of dirt into a victim\u2019s eyes and struck the right side of her face, the evidence warranted a finding of serious or permanent physical injury. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Tucceri, </em>9 Mass. App. Ct. 844, 845 (1980). We determined that vicious blows to the head of an unconscious victim were serious or permanent, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mercado, </em>24 Mass. App. Ct. 391, 395 (1987), and injuries to a victim\u2019s face with a knife were also serious or permanent. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hamm, </em>19 Mass. App. Ct. 72, 80 (1984); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Donoghue, </em>23 Mass. App. Ct. 103, 111 (1986), cert, denied, 481 U.S. 1022 (1987). Newton testified that the injuries to Jack\u2019s fingernails were so painful that \u201cit would be something that a child would do almost anything to get away from.\u201d Her opinion was that a struggle would have been required in order to administer the injuries, unless Jack was unconscious when they were inflicted. The nature of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>injuries to Jack\u2019s fingernails, the manner of infliction, and the repetition necessary to injure multiple fingers, render them sufficiently \u201cserious\u201d to be within the scope of the mayhem statute. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Robinson, 26 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 441, 445 (1988); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sparks, </em>42 Mass. App. Ct. 915, 916 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b426-5\"><em>Eyes. </em>The indictments for the injuries to Jack\u2019s eyes were submitted to the jury on both branches of mayhem. The defendants argue on appeal that the injury to Jack\u2019s eyes was not disabling and that therefore the indictments were improp\u00e9rly submitted to the jury on the theory of first branch of mayhem, which requires the Commonwealth to prove the defendants \u201cdisfigurefd] ... or disable[d] a limb or member.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b426-6\">Newton testified that at the time she first examined him, Jack had dime-sized areas of corneal abrasion and ulceration (cut or loss of tissue) in both eyes.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The surfaces of his eyes were bright red. His eyes were sensitive to light and Jack kept them closed. Ample evidence was presented through the testimony of Newton and Chavis that shortly after his injury, Jack had difficulty keeping his eyes open. After examining him at the time of trial, Newton testified that Jack\u2019s eyes maintained some scarring on each cornea,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> resulting in a whitish opaque film on his eyes. The evidence of the injury done to Jack\u2019s eyes was sufficient to support the first branch theory of mayhem, even if at trial Jack no longer had difficulty keeping his eyes open, or if the scarring did not permanently impair his vision. Subsequent recovery from an injury does not preclude a determination that the injury disabled a member. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hogan, </em>7 Mass. App. Ct. 236, 246, <em>S.C., </em>379 Mass. 190 (1979). We discern no error in the submission of indictments for injuries to Jack\u2019s eyes to the jury on the first branch theory of mayhem.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number><em>Jury verdict on indictments 103620 and 103637. </em>Indictments 103620 and 103637, alleging assault and battery causing bodily injury to a child, G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 13J, for injury to Jack\u2019s elbow, were submitted to the jury on the theory of intentional assault and battery,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> not on the theory of wanton or reckless assault and battery.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Although the judge instructed the jury as to and submitted the indictments to the jury only on the intentional assault and battery theory, the verdict slips contained check boxes for both theories of guilt. When the jury returned their verdicts, they checked only the box for the wanton or reckless theory. Apparently, neither counsel nor the judge checked the verdict slips before they went to the jury and counsel raised no objection at the time the verdicts were returned.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The defendants maintain on appeal that what transpired was error creating a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Russell, </em>439 Mass. 340, 351 (2003).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b427-7\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>\u201c(b) Whoever commits an assault and battery upon a child and by such assault and battery causes bodily injury shall be punished by imprisonment in the state prison for not more than five years .... Whoever commits an assault and battery upon a child and by such assault and battery causes substantial bodily injury shall be punished by imprisonment in the state prison for not more than fifteen years .... Whoever, having care and custody of a child, wantonly or recklessly permits bodily injury to such child or wantonly or recklessly permits another to commit assault and battery upon such child, which assault and battery causes bodily injury, shall be punished by imprisonment for not more than two and one-half years .... Whoever, having care and custody of a child, wantonly or recklessly permits substantial bodily injury to such child or wantonly or recklessly permits another to commit an assault and battery upon such child, which assault and battery causes substantial bodily injury, shall be punished by imprisonment in the state prison for not more than five years . . . .\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b428-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>Although the Commonwealth admits that the jury was not instructed to consider the wanton or reckless theory for indictments 103620 and 103637, and appears to acknowledge that error occurred, it argues that there was no substantial risk of miscarriage of justice because the evidence supported a verdict on either theory of assault and battery causing bodily injury to a child.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Moreover, the Commonwealth posits that the error lay not in the verdict slips but in the judge\u2019s failure to include in her charge to the jury an instruction on the wanton or reckless theory. We note in this regard, however, that the wanton or reckless portion of G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 13J, is not a lesser included offense, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>59 Mass. App. Ct. 157, 162 (2003), <em>S.C., </em>441 Mass. 73 (2004), and that the Commonwealth hence was not automatically entitled to an instruction on that crime. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Woodward, </em>427 Mass. 659, 663-665 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b428-5\">Proceeding on the assumption that error occurred, we limit our review to determining if there is a serious doubt as to whether the jury verdict might have been otherwise had the unfortunate incongruity between the judge\u2019s instructions and the verdict slips not occurred. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Russell, </em>439 Mass, at 345. We must consider whether, \u201cin the context of the entire trial\u201d and the case as a whole, see <em>ibid., </em>quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Randolph, </em>438 Mass. 290, 298 (2002), there was evidence sufficient to support an instruction on intentional assault and battery and on wanton or reckless assault or battery.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-6\">Indictments 103620 and 103637 charged the defendants with assault and battery resulting in the suprachondral fracture to Jack\u2019s left elbow, which was surgically repaired with a pin and placed in a cast. Newton testified that this injury could have been caused by a severe direct blow, a bending back of the elbow, or a fall down a flight of stairs. She further testified that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>this type of fracture would cause any movement to be restricted by pain. Newton\u2019s opinion was that the injury to Jack\u2019s elbow was less than a week old when she examined him on June 14, 2000. During the incident that Chavis observed at the dinner table the evening of June 11, 2000, Darrell grabbed Jack\u2019s left arm and held him up while he struck him two or three times with his belt. Because the jury returned verdicts of guilty on indictments 103620 and 103637, they surely must have concluded that Jack was in the custody of the defendants when the injury to his elbow occurred. See G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 13J (\u201cWhoever, having care and custody of a child, wantonly or recklessly permits substantial bodily injury to such child . . .\u201d). The defendants\u2019 custody of Jack during the elbow injury, and Chavis\u2019s testimony regarding the incident in which Darrell grabbed Jack\u2019s left arm, are together sufficient evidence to have warranted an instruction on intentional assault and battery. Sufficient circumstantial evidence was also before the jury permitting them to find that the defendants knew, or that an ordinary person in the same circumstances would have known, of the injury to Jack\u2019s elbow. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Garcia, </em>47 Mass. App. Ct. 419, 422 (1999). Accordingly, the evidence also supported an instruction on wanton or reckless assault and battery. See <em>id. </em>at 423.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-4\">The judge\u2019s instructions as to indictments 103620 and 103637 were given directly after she had instructed the jury as to indictments 103619 and 103636.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> She had accordingly just instructed the jury regarding the definitions of intentional assault and battery and wanton or reckless assault and battery. Since the jury received instruction on the meaning of both intentional and wanton or reckless assault and battery, and were presented with evidence from which a reasonable jury could find such conduct, we are persuaded that, in these circumstances, the omission of an instruction to consider the wanton or reckless theory of assault and battery as to indictments 103620 and 103637 did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>create a substantial risk of miscarriage of justice.

The transcript reference upon which the Commonwealth relies does not in fact support the Commonwealth\u2019s position. At best, the judge\u2019s stated views on whether to instruct upon both or just one theory are ambiguous and reflect considerable reluctance to instruct on both theories.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b429-5\">Indictments 103619 and 103636 alleged assault and battery causing bodily injury to a child under fourteen years of age, for fractures to five of Jack\u2019s fingers.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
