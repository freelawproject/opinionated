When the hospital\u2019s request was denied following an informal conference, G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 10A, it sought a hearing pursuant to G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 11, where the hospital sue<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>ceeded in its bid to discontinue benefits to Conroy. The reviewing board of the Department of Industrial Accidents (department) upheld the administrative judge\u2019s determination that Conroy had \u201cprevailed\u201d in the \u00a7 11 hearing, entitling her to an award of attorney\u2019s fees and expenses under G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 13A(5).</p>\n<p id=\"b303-5\">At the crux of the reviewing board\u2019s decision was the fact that the hospital did not, at any point in the proceedings when it might have been appropriate to do so, limit the period for which Conroy was at risk for recoupment of benefits ordered to be paid after the informal conference, and that she therefore was required to defend against the possibility that the hospital would seek a recoupment of benefits to at least the date of the conference order. We agree that on the particular facts of this case Conroy prevailed at the hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-6\">1. <em>Summary of facts and proceedings. </em>We summarize certain facts to provide a background for the dispute. Conroy was hired as a nurse\u2019s aide at the hospital in 1989. Her duties eventually required that, among other things, she transport patients from the postsurgery recovery room to different floors in the hospital. On March 12, 1993, Conroy attempted to push a patient in a heavy bed into the hospital elevator when one of the wheels of the bed became caught in the threshold. As Conroy lifted the bed in an attempt to dislodge the wheel, she felt a \u201ccrack\u201d across her back. Conroy sought treatment in the hospital\u2019s emergency room immediately after the incident, and later with a series of physicians. Her treatment consisted primarily of medical and physical therapy, as well as cortisone injections approximately every six months, but no surgery was ever performed.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-7\">At the time of the incident, the hospital accepted Conroy\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation claim and Conroy received temporary total incapacity benefits pursuant to G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 34, at a rate of $195.89 per week (based on an average weekly wage of $326.48).</p>\n<p id=\"b303-8\">On December 12, 1994, the hospital filed a complaint for leave to discontinue or modify benefits. The hospital\u2019s com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>plaint did not request a specific termination date.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On March 14, 1995, an administrative judge of the department held an informal conference pursuant to G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 10A, as amended through St. 1991, c. 398, \u00a7\u00a7 27, 28, in the course of which Conroy, assisted by counsel, presented her case.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The conference order denied the hospital\u2019s request for discontinuance and continued Conroy\u2019s weekly benefit payments. The hospital requested a de nova evidentiary hearing pursuant to G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-4\">The hospital\u2019s request for a \u00a7 11 hearing triggered the appointment of an impartial medical examiner in accordance with G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 11A, and Dr. Forrest Maddix was duly appointed.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Conroy was examined by Dr. Maddix on May 25, 1995. In his examination report, Dr. Maddix stated that Con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>roy\u2019s \u201csymptoms are grossly exaggerated\u201d and concluded \u201cthat there is no apparent organic justification from an orthopedic standpoint for continuing to consider that she is disabled as a result of an incident occurring at work in March, 1993.\u201d Dr. Maddix limited his report to Conroy\u2019s presentation at the time of the examination; he made no findings concerning her condition prior to May 25, 1995.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-4\">Neither party deposed Dr. Maddix, and his report was submitted as prima facie evidence at the subsequent \u00a7 11 hearing before the administrative judge. See G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 11A(2). At the beginning of that hearing, as well as at the close of Conroy\u2019s testimony, counsel for Conroy moved to introduce additional medical evidence. The hospital opposed both motions, claiming that the impartial medical examiner\u2019s report was adequate. The administrative judge agreed and denied Conroy\u2019s request. See G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 11A(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b305-5\">The administrative judge adopted Dr. Maddix\u2019s opinion, concluding that Conroy \u201chas no disability, partial or total, temporary or permanent, which is causally related to the incident of March 12, 1993,\u201d and that Conroy was, therefore, no longer entitled to benefits, which were ordered discontinued as of the May 25, 1995, examination. Under authority of G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 13A(5), the administrative judge\u2019s decision further required the hospital to pay to Conroy attorney\u2019s fees and expenses in the amount of $3,912.35.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-6\">The hospital appealed to the reviewing board, see G. L. c. 23E, \u00a7 5; G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 11, taking the position that Conroy had not \u201cprevailed\u201d as contemplated by \u00a7 13A(5), because \u201cthe administrative judge did not direct payment of weekly or other compensation exceeding that being paid by the insurer prior to the date of decision.\u201d Conroy took no appeal from any part of the decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-7\">A two-person majority of the reviewing board recommitted the matter to the administrative judge, concluding that it was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>unable to render a decision absent additional findings on the issue whether Conroy was faced with, and thus was required to defend against, the risk of losing benefits during the period preceding the May 25, 1995, discontinuance date. The reviewing board framed' the issues to be determined as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b306-5\">\u201cIn order to receive an attorney\u2019s fee under G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 13A(5), the employee must prevail on some disputed issue at hearing, either by gaining or not losing some degree of benefits within the disputed time frame. . . . Ordinarily, in the context of an original liability claim, the disputed period begins from the date of injury or the last day of work. By contrast when an insurer seeks to discontinue, the disputed period begins no earlier than the filing date of the complaint, as said filing signifies its resistance to each ensuing payment. . . . [I]usurers can, and many do, decide at any stage of the dispute process to stipulate to an abbreviated contested time frame or they may desist entirely.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b306-6\">On remand, the administrative judge conducted a further hearing, during which he permitted Conroy (over the hospital\u2019s objection) to introduce additional medical evidence.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In his decision following remand, the administrative judge made these additional subsidiary findings: \u201cthe employee was totally disabled at least through February 8, 1995. There was no medical evidence covering the period from December 12, 1994, through the May 25, 1995, [report] which indicated that the employee\u2019s disability was less than total\u201d; at the time of the hearing, \u201cthe [hospital\u2019s] issue sheet did not specify the specific period in dispute\u201d; and \u201c[t]he hearing transcript is silent as to the specific dates of the period in dispute.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The administrative judge determined that the \u201cperiod in dispute\u201d began on December 12, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>1994, the date of the hospital\u2019s complaint to discontinue benefits, and ended on May 25, 1995, the date of the impartial medical examination, and that Conroy had therefore \u201cprevailed\u201d in demonstrating her entitlement to benefits for that time period and was thus entitled to collect attorney\u2019s fees. The board unanimously affirmed the administrative judge\u2019s decision, <em>Conroy </em>v. <em>Norwood Hosp., </em>14 Mass. Workers\u2019 Comp. Rep. 130 (2000), and the hospital brought an appeal.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b307-4\">We agree with the decision of the reviewing board, bearing in mind that \u201c[w]e may set aside the [reviewing] board\u2019s decision only if it is infected with error under G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14(7)(a)-<em>(d), (f)-(g),\u201d Murphy\u2019s Case, </em>53 Mass. App. Ct. 708, 711 (2002), and that \u201c[o]rdinarily an agency\u2019s interpretation of its own rule is entitled to great weight.\u201d <em>Gonzalez\u2019s Case, </em>41 Mass. App. Ct. 39, 41 (1996), quoting from <em>Finkelstein </em>v. <em>Board of Registration in Optometry, </em>370 Mass. 476, 478 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b307-5\">2. <em>Discussion. </em>The Workers\u2019 Compensation Act provides for the award of attorney\u2019s fees when an employee prevails at a \u00a7 11 hearing. G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 13A(5).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The word \u201cprevail\u201d is not defined in the statute but applicable regulations provide that \u201cthe claimant shall be deemed to have prevailed, for the purposes of M. G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 13A, when compensation is ordered or is not discontinued at such proceeding . . . [excluding circumstances not relevant here].\u201d 452 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 1.19(4) (1992). Our decisional law has also ascribed meaning to the concept \u201cprevailing party.\u201d In <em>Connolly\u2019s Case, </em>we said that an employee is considered the prevailing party if she \u201csuc<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>ceeds on any significant litigation issue, achieving \u2018some of the benefit\u2019 sought in the controversy.\u201d 41 Mass. App. Ct. 35, 38 (1996), quoting from <em>Nadeau </em>v. <em>Helgemoe, </em>581 F.2d 275, 278-279 (1st Cir. 1978), overruled in part by <em>Richardson </em>v. <em>Miller, 219 </em>F.3d 1, 4 (1st Cir. 2002). See <em>Draper </em>v. <em>Town Clerk of Greenfield, </em>384 Mass. 444, 453 (1981), cert, denied sub nom. <em>Draper </em>v. <em>Prescott, </em>456 U.S. 947 (1982).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b308-4\">In the context of a complaint by an insurer to discontinue or modify benefits, a conference order denying a request to discontinue or modify is, in effect, an order requiring the insurer to pay compensation. Consequently, at any date thereafter, the insurer is paying \u201ccompensation pursuant to a conference order.\u201d If the insurer then requests a de nova evidentiary hearing after which the request to discontinue benefits is allowed, an insurer is entitled to recover any overpayments. G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 11D(3).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b308-5\">By appealing the conference order, the hospital was, in effect, asserting the position that the administrative judge erred in failing to discontinue the employee\u2019s benefits from, at the very least, the date of the conference order denying its complaint. As <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>the administrative judge found, the hospital did not, at any point in the proceedings, limit the time period for which it sought discontinuance.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b309-4\">Where the insurer (or here, the self-insurer) appeals from a conference order denying its request to discontinue benefits and it does not limit the time frame for that request, it triggers \u201cthe third stage of the review process,\u201d a hearing de nova where, once again, the employee is put to the task of proving her entitlement to benefits for all of the potential time frames falling under the umbrella of the insurer\u2019s complaint for discontinuance. See <em>Murphy </em>v. <em>Commissioner of the Dept. of Industrial Accs., </em>415 Mass. 218, 224 (1993). See also <em>Mulcahey\u2019s Case, </em>26 Mass. App. Ct. 1, 3 (1988) (burden of proving incapacity rests with employee \u201ceven where compensation has been awarded and the insurer is applying for discontinuance\u201d); <em>Connolly\u2019s Case, </em>41 Mass. App. Ct. at 37.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-5\">The hospital argues that its decision not to offer additional medical evidence at the first \u00a7 11 hearing, coupled with its objection to Conroy\u2019s submission of such evidence, was indicative of its position that it was seeking to terminate benefits only as of the date of the independent medical examination.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The hospital notes that, when there is no evidence to indicate that an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>earlier date is warranted, the date for termination of benefits will often coincide with that of the impartial exam. This is so even though the law permits retroactive termination to the date the complaint was filed. See <em>Cubellis </em>v. <em>Mozzarella House, Inc., </em>9 Mass. Workers\u2019 Comp. Rep. 354, 356 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b310-4\">Although we acknowledge that in this field certain procedures may have developed in accordance with established practice<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> (and even accepting that complaints for retroactive termination are \u201crare\u201d), in the absence of some affirmative limitation set by the insurer, the employee is not relieved of her burden of proving entitlement to benefits for the entire time period covered by the insurer\u2019s complaint, and remains at risk for recoupment. See <em>Connolly\u2019s Case, supra </em>at 37 (\u201call the benefits granted in the conference order were in jeopardy\u201d). Cf. <em>Cruz\u2019s Case, </em>51 Mass. App. Ct. 26, 29 (2001) (where employer sought reduction, suspension, or discontinuance of benefits, and issue at \u00a7 11 hearing included extent of present disability and cause of present disability, \u201c[t]he insurer by its appeal was contesting not only the extent of the employee\u2019s disability but also its causal relationship to the accident,\u201d placing entire entitlement to compensation in jeopardy).</p>\n<p id=\"b310-5\">The hospital seeks to distinguish <em>Connolly\u2019s Case, </em>arguing that the administrative judge had in that case ordered continuation of benefits awarded at the time of the conference.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> We disagree and conclude that the holding in that case is applicable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>as well to the circumstances here, and that Conroy has prevailed because compensation was ordered \u201cin the sense that the previously ordered payments were confirmed.\u201d <em>Connolly\u2019s Case, </em>41 Mass. App. Ct. at 37. Although the present case does not involve a claim for initial disability, the issues at the first \u00a7 11 hearing, as in <em>Connolly\u2019s Case, supra, </em>were \u201cthe issuefs] of disability and extent of disability, causal relationship of present disability.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b311-4\">In the absence of a definitive statement in the hearing memorandum or a stipulation of the parties limiting the disputed period to the date of the impartial medical examination, it was within the authority of the administrative judge to reduce, retroactively, the temporary disability payments awarded by the conference order. \u201cHad the administrative judge, responding to the employer\u2019s appeal, in any way reduced the temporary disability payments awarded by the conference order, the employee would have been exposed to a recoupment claim by the employer for the recovery of overpayments pursuant to \u00a7 11D(3).\u201d <em>Connolly\u2019s Case, supra </em>at 37-38. <em>Murphy\u2019s Case, </em>53 Mass. App. Ct. at 717.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-7\">Viewed in the context of the hospital\u2019s open-ended complaint for discontinuance, the absence of a specific limitation as to the period for which discontinuance of benefits was sought, and the conference order requiring ongoing payment of benefits, Conroy was successful at the \u00a7 11 hearing in obtaining, and retaining against possible recoupment, an additional ten weeks of benefits, running from the date of the conference order on March 14, 1995, and continuing to May 25, 1995, the date benefits were discontinued.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-8\">3. <em>Conclusion. </em>Based on the foregoing, we reverse the judgment of the single justice, and order the entry of a new judgment affirming the decision of the reviewing board dated May 23, 2000.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-9\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b304-5\"><em>A </em>copy of that complaint was not included in the record. It is not disputed that the complaint sought to modify or to discontinue benefits but did not specify a date from which the modification or discontinuance would run (presumably because, as of the date of the complaint, this was not yet known).</p>\n<p id=\"b304-6\">We note that documentation supporting the hospital\u2019s assertion that Conroy was no longer entitled to \u00a7 34 benefits should have been included with the complaint. G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 7G. The department\u2019s regulations specifically require that an insurer\u2019s complaint \u201cshall be accompanied, where applicable, by the following documentation: (1) hospital and medical records; (2) physician\u2019s report(s) opining work capacity which shall be no more than six months old; (3) an investigator\u2019s report or a synopsis which contains information indicating that the employee is working or exhibiting the capability of working, where the report is the sole basis for discontinuance; (4) wage records demonstrating employment of the employee during the period compensation was collected; (5) a job description of any work offered to the employee when accompanied by a medical report which contains a physician\u2019s opinion that the employee is capable of doing such work; (6) a brief memorandum or affidavit specifying the basis for the request to modify or terminate benefits.\u201d 452 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 1.07(2)(j) (1993). Nothing in the record suggests that the complaint was not accompanied by the requisite documentation supporting discontinuance or modification.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b304-7\"> \u201cThe conference procedure was enacted (St. 1971, c. 974) to allow the board \u2018to expedite compensation claims without the necessity of a full hearing.\u2019 <em>Assuncao\u2019s Case, </em>372 Mass. 6, 9 (1977).

In connection with his employer\u2019s challenge to Connolly\u2019s disability, a conference order awarded Connolly temporary total incapacity compensation from April 19, 1991, to July 2, 1991. Connolly and the employer appealed \u2014 Connolly sought benefits beyond July 2, 1991, whereas the employer raised issues <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>of liability, disability, and extent of disability. The administrative judge confirmed the period of temporary total disability, but then concluded that Connolly was capable of returning to work without restriction.
