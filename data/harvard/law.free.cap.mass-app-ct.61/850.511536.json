(Deere) golf and turf products. When Deere insisted that Doering purchase a large number of \u201cturf gators,\u201d a new <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"851\">*851</page-number>multipurpose utility vehicle that Doering thought would sell poorly, Doering terminated the contract and sought to recover its losses incurred during the previous three years. It claimed that the demand that it purchase the turf gators breached the covenant of good faith and fair dealing, and constituted an unfair trade practice in violation of G. L. c. 93A. Concluding that Doering\u2019s operating losses were not causally connected to Deere\u2019s turf gator demand, and that Doering could not present a viable theory of damages for the claimed losses, the trial judge granted a pretrial motion excluding Doering\u2019s claims for damages. On appeal, Doering argues that the operating losses are recoverable as reliance damages. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-5\"><em>Facts and prior proceedings. </em>Doering, which sold and installed trucking equipment, entered into a distributorship agreement in 1993 with Deere for Deere\u2019s golf and turf product line. Under the agreement, Doering was authorized to purchase equipment with floor plan financing (i.e., deferring payment until the time of sale to a customer), and it agreed to provide a sufficient staff adequately trained to carry out its obligations under the agreement. Deere could terminate immediately for cause for certain defaults, including the failure to pay for goods when due, or to provide sufficient staff. It could also terminate upon 180 days notice if Deere determined that the distributor\u2019s area<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> did not afford sufficient sales potential or if Deere \u201cbelieve[d] the [distributor [was] not fulfilling the requirements of his appointment despite the opportunity to correct or take appropriate action toward . . . deficiencies in . . . performance or operations\u201d for which it had received notice. Doering, in contrast, could only terminate upon 180 days written notice unless such termination was by mutual consent. The agreement specifically provided that upon termination for whatever reason, \u201cneither party is entitled to any compensation or reimbursement for loss of prospective profits, anticipated sales or other losses occasioned by termination or cancellation of this Agreement,\u201d except respecting obligations resulting from goods already delivered to Doering.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-6\">In 1996, Deere began to complain of understaffing by Doering, and demanded another salesperson. Doering responded that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"852\">*852</page-number>it intended to add one, but only after its current sales force began to pay for itself. Also, by October 17, 1996, Doering had repaid Deere only $20,000 of $100,000 which had been mistakenly credited to it over the summer. Deere had prepared a termination notice, but had not informed Doering about it.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-4\">At a meeting on October 17, 1996, Deere allegedly told Doering that it must purchase forty-four turf gators and add a salesperson, and that both were nonnegotiable requirements. The agreement provided that Doering \u201cmaintain an inventory of goods in proportion to sales possibilities.\u201d Doering replied that customer feedback indicated that no one wanted the turf gators and that they were overpriced, but Deere was firm. Doering also repeated that it could not afford another salesperson, but again Deere was firm. One week later, on October 24, 1996, Doering notified Deere in writing that it was terminating the distributorship agreement. Deere accepted the letter of termination, although it denied that it had required Doering to order a specific number of turf gators.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-5\">Doering brought suit against Deere, seeking (as amended) declaratory relief and alleging claims of violation of G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 11, breach of good faith under G. L. c. 106, \u00a7\u00a7 1-203 and 2-103(1)(b), breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing, deceit and misrepresentation, promissory estoppel, constructive termination, and constructive termination of a \u201cdealer agreement\u201d in violation of G. L. c. 93G, \u00a7 2. Doering sought recovery of approximately $500,000, consisting of its operating losses for its golf and turf business over the last three years ($139,865 in 1996; $150,720 in 1995; and $172,783 in 1994) and attorney\u2019s fees. Doering did not seek recovery for lost profits. Deere counterclaimed for monies previously owed.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-6\">A Superior Court judge granted summary judgment for Deere on so much of Doering\u2019s amended complaint as was predicated on statements by Deere that allegedly induced Doering to become a distributor, ruling that such claims failed because the statements were mere expressions of belief or opinion, and Doering\u2019s reliance on them was not reasonable.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> As for claims arising out of the meeting on October 17, 1996 (i.e., that Deere <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"853\">*853</page-number>made unreasonable demands upon Doering respecting the turf gators), the judge concluded that summary judgment was premature as there were factual issues respecting whether Deere had violated the covenant of good faith and fair dealing and G. L. c. 93A. He also allowed summary judgment on the constructive termination count as not presenting a cause of action apart from the c. 93A and breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing claims. Finally, he allowed summary judgment on the G. L. c. 93G claim as arising before the effective date of the statute.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In a footnote, the motion judge stated that the court \u201cexpressly is not deciding whether damages from constructive discharge are properly cognizable in this case, especially considering the express limitation on the elements of permissible damages set forth in the Distributor\u2019s Agreement.\u201d Doering has not challenged the summary judgment decision on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-5\">The trial judge allowed Deere\u2019s motion in limine to preclude Doering from introducing evidence of damages, effectively ending Doering\u2019s case. He considered the contract documents, Doering\u2019s \u201cstatement of losses on Deere\u2019s Golf and Turf products line and . . . the summary judgment record.\u201d He concluded that Doering had not articulated any legally cognizable theory of damages, in that there was no causal connection between its damage claims and the demands related to the meeting of October 17, 1996. In so concluding, the judge ruled that the damages Doering sought were related to the claims on which the motion judge had already allowed summary judgment, rather than to any surviving claims arising out of the October 17 meeting.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-6\">After trial on its counterclaim, Deere recovered damages of $118,467.34, plus attorney\u2019s fees of $70,000 (amended judgment on counterclaim). Doering has not appealed from the judgment on the counterclaim, and it is not at issue except insofar as it bears on Doering\u2019s argument that it was wrongly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"854\">*854</page-number>prevented from introducing evidence on its defense, of setoff. Doering has appealed the decision allowing the motion in limine, asserting that the trial judge \u201coverruled\u201d the motion judge as to the availability of damages arising out of the October 17, 1996, meeting, and claiming error in the trial judge\u2019s rejection of its c. 93A and breach of good faith claims and its affirmative defense of setoff.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-4\"><em>Discussion. </em>We begin with the procedural arguments. First, we reject Doering\u2019s contention that the trial judge improperly overruled the motion judge regarding the viability of the damages claim. Although not perfectly clear, the motion judge\u2019s footnote, regarding the permissible scope of damages as set forth in the parties\u2019 \u201cDistributor\u2019s Agreement,\u201d indicates that he made no determination on this issue. Regardless, the trial judge was not precluded from revisiting the issue even if the motion judge had ruled on the question. <em>Barron </em>v. <em>Fidelity Magellan Fund, </em>57 Mass. 507, 519 (2003) (\u201cEven if the two motions [for summary judgment] addressed the same issue, until final judgment, a judge may entertain a motion on which another judge has previously ruled\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b888-5\">We next consider the standard of review applicable to the decision to allow the motion in limine. Doering contends that the trial judge applied a rule 12(b)(6) standard regarding the viability of the damages claim (Mass.R.Civ.P. 12[b][6], 365 Mass. 754 [1974]), while Deere claims that the trial judge treated the motion in limine as a second summary judgment motion. Based on his explicit consideration of the \u201csummary judgment record,\u201d and the statement of losses that was not included in the complaint, we consider his decision as an allowance of summary judgment. We therefore \u201ctake the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party to determine whether all material facts had been established and whether [Deere] was entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d <em>Kuwaiti Danish Computer Co. </em>v. <em>Digital Equip. Corp., </em>438 Mass. 459, 464 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b888-6\">Doering has consistently. sought to recover all its operating losses, but its theory of recovery has an elusive, chameleon-like quality. On appeal, Doering appears to have settled generally on a reliance theory of damages. It also identifies the turf gator <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"855\">*855</page-number>demand as the breach or unfair trade practice for which it seeks recovery. The relationship between the breach and the damages, however, is unclear.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-5\">As the trial judge recognized, there appears to be no causal connection between the prior years\u2019 losses and the demand that Doering purchase the turf gators. See, e.g., <em>Massachusetts Farm Bureau Fedn., Inc. </em>v. <em>Blue Cross of Massachusetts, Inc., </em>403 Mass. 722, 730 (1989) (\u201cIn the absence of a causal relationship between the alleged unfair acts and the claimed loss, there can be no recovery\u201d). See <em>VMark Software, Inc. </em>v. <em>EMC Corp., </em>37 Mass. App. Ct. 610, 611-612 n.2 (1994) (measure of contract reliance damages is \u201csimilar to the tort standard of actual, or out-of-pocket, loss proximately suffered\u201d). See also <em>Sullivan </em>v. <em>O\u2019Connor, </em>363 Mass. 579, 588 n.6 (1973). The damages sought had been sustained while the contract was being performed according to its terms, before the turf gator demand was made.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> According to the damages figures submitted by Doering, the agreement was a losing proposition from the outset. The damages were, therefore, caused by the bad bargain itself, not the October breach. The breach may have led Doering to terminate the contract, but it did not cause the contract losses, which Doering had already incurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-6\">Doering seems to recognize the unfavorable nature of the bargain, as it makes no argument that the breach prevented it from continuing the contract and recouping the accrued losses. See <em>Mistletoe Express Serv. </em>v. <em>Locke, </em>762 S.W.2d 637, 638 (Tex. App. 1988). Doering also has not generally argued that the breach deprived it of the benefit of the bargain. See <em>Anthony\u2019s Pier Four, Inc. </em>v. <em>HBC Assocs., </em>411 Mass. 451, 472 (1991); <em>VMark Software, Inc. </em>v. <em>EMC Corp., supra </em>at 611 n.2, citing <em>John Hetherington &amp; Sons, Ltd. </em>v. <em>William Firth Co., </em>210 Mass. 8, 21 (1911) (\u201c[t]he long-established general mie for breach of contract recovery in Massachusetts is that the wronged party should receive the benefit of his bargain, i.e., be placed in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"856\">*856</page-number>same position as if the contract had been performed\u201d). See also Restatement (Second) of Contracts \u00a7 347 (1981) (\u201cContract damages are ordinarily based on the injured party\u2019s expectation interest and are intended to give him the benefit of his bargain by awarding him a sum of money that will, to the extent possible, put him in as good a position as he would have been in had the contract been performed\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b890-4\">Relying on <em>VMark Software </em>v. <em>EMC Corp., supra </em>at 611 n.2, 625, and the Restatement (Second) of Contracts \u00a7 349 (1981), Doering contends instead that it is entitled to recover its operating losses for the three years prior to the \u201cconstructive termination\u201d of the contract as \u201creliance\u201d damages. As this court stated in <em>VMark, </em>\u201cin an appropriate case, Massachusetts law permits, as an alternative to such \u2018expectation\u2019 damages, the recovery of \u2018reliance\u2019 damages, i.e., expenditures made in reliance upon a contractual obligation that was not performed.\u201d <em>VMark Software </em>v. <em>EMC Corp., supra </em>at 611 n.2. See <em>Sullivan </em>v. <em>O\u2019Connor, supra </em>at 583-585; <em>Lord\u2019s &amp; Lady\u2019s Enterprises, Inc. </em>v. <em>John Paul Mitchell Sys., </em>46 Mass. App. Ct. 262, 269 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b890-5\">In <em>VMark, </em>unlike this case, there was a direct causal connection between the expenditures sought by the injured party as reliance damages and the contractual obligations that were not performed. There, the injured party purchased computer hardware from a third company in \u201creliance on VMark\u2019s supplying it with a software product that would be fully functional in conjunction with that hardware.\u201d <em>VMark Software, Inc. </em>v. <em>EMC Corp., supra </em>at 612. We concluded that the hardware would not have been purchased \u201cbut for VMark\u2019s misleading representations.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 619. Here, in contrast, the motion judge, in allowing summary judgment, rejected Doering\u2019s contention that it could prove that it entered into the contract and incurred the expenses based on various misrepresentations. Doering does not challenge this decision on appeal. The lack of a causal connection between the claimed breach (or unfair act) and the losses is fatal to Doering\u2019s claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-6\">Furthermore, as provided in the Restatement (Second) of Contracts \u00a7 349, the \u201cinjured party has a right to damages based on his reliance interest, including expenditures made in preparation for performance or in performance,\u201d but \u201cless any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"857\">*857</page-number>loss that the party in breach can prove with reasonable certainty the injured party would have suffered had the contract been performed.\u201d See <em>L. Albert &amp; Son </em>v. <em>Armstrong Rubber Co., </em>178 F.2d 182, 189 (2d Cir. 1949) (where Hand, J., writing for the court, stated, \u201c[o]n principle therefore the proper solution would seem to be that the promisee may recover his outlay in preparation for the performance, subject to the privilege of the promisor to reduce it by as much as he can show that the promisee would have lost, if the contract had been performed\u201d).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In the instant case, Doering is seeking to recover expenditures made in preparation for performance or during performance, but has also demonstrated, through its own submissions, that the contract, as performed, had been a losing proposition since inception, separate and apart from the breach. In fact, the operating losses for the contract, while being performed by both parties, are exactly what Doering seeks to recover. We are, therefore, in the rare position of being able to judge with accuracy \u201cwhat the fate of the venture would have been had it not been interrupted\u201d by the defendant\u2019s breach. Fuller &amp; Perdue, The Reliance Interest in Contract Damages, 46 Yale L.J. 52, 79 (1936). See <em>L. Albert &amp; Son </em>v. <em>Armstrong Rubber Co., supra </em>at 189 (\u201cIt is often very hard to learn what the value of the performance would have been\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b891-6\">If Doering recovered its losses as requested, it would be in a better position than if the contract had been performed. This would violate the fundamental principle first articulated by Professor Fuller and thereafter adopted by Judge Learned Hand in <em>Albert &amp; Son </em>v. <em>Armstrong Rubber Co., id. </em>at 191, the Restatement (Second) of Contracts, and this court in <em>Lord\u2019s &amp; Lady\u2019s Enterprises, Inc. </em>v. <em>John Paul Mitchell Sys., </em>46 Mass. App. Ct. at 270, that \u201c[w]e will not in a suit for reimbursement for losses incurred in reliance on a contract knowingly put the plaintiff in a better position than he would have [been in] . . . <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"858\">*858</page-number>had the contract been fully performed.\u201d Fuller &amp; Perdue, <em>supra </em>at 79. See <em>Productora e Importadora de Papel </em>v. <em>Fleming, 376 </em>Mass. 826, 839 (1978) (damage award \u201cshould be reduced, even to extinction, by the expenses that the breach\u201d allowed the injured party to avoid). See also 3 Dobbs, Law of Remedies \u00a7 12.3(2), at 56-57 (\u201cTo allow reliance recovery in excess of the appropriate measure of expectancy would mean that the plaintiff would be better off by reason of the breach and recovery than he would have been upon full performance\u201d).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b892-4\">We also reject Doering\u2019s arguments that it suffered a G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 11, violation, that is, a loss of money or property as a result of an unfair or deceptive act or practice. As previously explained, there is nothing in the record to establish that Deere\u2019s insistence that Doering purchase forty-four turf gators, the basis of the c. 93A claim, caused Doering any monetary damages apart from legal fees. Moreover, Doering was not \u201cforced to incur\u201d legal fees as a result of litigation initiated against it. See <em>Tech Plus, Inc. </em>v. <em>Ansel, </em>59 Mass. App. Ct. 12, 21 (2003). Compare <em>Columbia Chiropractic Group, Inc. </em>v. <em>Trust Ins. Co., </em>430 Mass. 60, 63 (1999) (\u201cIf a violation of G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 11, forces another to incur attorney\u2019s fees, those fees are a loss of money or property and may be recovered as G. L. c. 93A damages\u201d). Nor was it forced to incur fees to seek to enforce the contract that it claims was constructively terminated by the c. 93A violation. Rather, it brought suit to recover damages that we have concluded are unrelated to the unfair act or practice that forms the basis of the c. 93A claim. The expenditure of this type of attorney\u2019s fees does not represent a loss of money or property within the meaning of c. 93A, \u00a7 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-5\">Finally, Doering relies on G. L. c. 106, \u00a7 2-715(1), to recover its operating losses as \u201cany reasonable expense incident\u201d to Deere\u2019s breach of its obligation of good faith in its performance or enforcement of the contract. By the express terms of \u00a7 2-715(1), incidental damages are those resulting from the breach.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"859\">*859</page-number>They may include, for example, \u201csuch costs as \u2018expenses reasonably incurred in inspection, receipt, transportation and care and custody of goods rightfully rejected.\u2019 \u201d <em>Fortin </em>v. <em>Ox-Bow Marina, Inc., </em>408 Mass. 310, 321 n. 4 (1990), quoting from G. L. c. 106, \u00a7 2-715(1). The damages must therefore, at a minimum, bear some relationship to the breach. As there is no causal connection between the October turf gator demand and the operating losses, these losses cannot be recovered pursuant to G. L. c. 106, \u00a7 2-715(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b893-4\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b885-7\">The area included most of Massachusetts.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b886-7\">The statements were that (1) Deere had been poorly represented previously; (2) Deere had \u201can acceptable and complete product line\u201d and would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"853\">*853</page-number>provide adequate support; and (3) Doering would be able to achieve profitability within three years.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b887-9\">The judge denied Doering\u2019s motion for partial summary judgment, and granted summary judgment to Deere as to liability (contingent upon Deere\u2019s submission of a certified record of its filing with the Secretary of the Commonwealth in accordance with G. L. c. 181, \u00a7 4) on the counterclaim.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b889-7\">Doering has not identified or argued, at least since the first summary judgment motion, any breach by Deere of the contract or the implied covenant of good faith occurring during the prior three-year period. Furthermore, it certainly has not alleged a breach during that three-year period causally connected to these losses, and not covered by the limitation of damages provision in the contract.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b891-9\">We recognize that a \u201cparty standing in breach cannot insist on mathematical precision in the measurement of damages, and may expect some lack of sympathy when he claims that the loss would have been suffered even if breach had not occurred.\u201d <em>Gilmore </em>v. <em>Century Bank &amp; Trust Co., </em>20 Mass. App. Ct. 49, 55 (1985). Therefore, the burden is placed on the breaching party to establish the losses with \u201creasonable certainty.\u201d Restatement (Second) of Contracts at \u00a7 349.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b892-6\">As the parties have not addressed the issue, and it is unnecessary to our decision, we do not address whether the contract\u2019s limitation of damages provision provides additional support for the rejection of these claims, particularly to the extent they sound in contract and not tort.
