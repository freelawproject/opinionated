With some hesitation, borne principally of the infrequency of instances in our decisional law where convictions have been reversed for improper joinder, we have come to the conclusion that the judge erred in this case by allowing the Com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>monwealth\u2019s motion for joinder of the charges involving the different victims.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-4\">The general rule is that \u201crelated cases\u201d should be joined for trial unless joinder is not in the best interests of justice. The Rules of Criminal Procedure define \u201crelated offenses\u201d as those \u201cbased on the same criminal conduct or episode or [which] arise out of a course of criminal conduct or series of criminal episodes connected together or constituting parts of a single scheme or plan.\u201d Mass.R.Crim.P. 9(a)(1), 378 Mass. 859 (1979). See discussion in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sullivan, </em>436 Mass. 799, 802-805 (2002). \u201c[T]he propriety of join[der] . . . turns, in large measure, on whether evidence of the other . . . offenses would have been admissible at a separate trial on each indictment.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mamay, </em>407 Mass. 412, 417 (1990), citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gallison, </em>383 Mass. 659, 672 (1981). Such evidence is inadmissible to prove the propensity of the defendant to commit crimes of a type, <em>ibid.-, </em>but it can be used to \u201cshow a common scheme, pattern of operation, absence of accident or mistake, identity, intent, or motive.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Helfant, </em>398 Mass. 214, 224 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b638-5\">Prior reported decisions sanctioning joinder for trial of abuse charges involving different victims (or, alternatively, use of evidence of abuse against a different victim) have hewed to those guidelines. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gallison, supra </em>at 671-673 (parents of two young children abused both repeatedly over the same time period); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>King, </em>387 Mass. 464, 469-473 (1982) (deviant sexual abuse of young siblings during same time period); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pope, </em>392 Mass. 493, 502-503 (1984) (defendant assaulted four women attending convention during one four-hour period); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Helfant, supra </em>at 226-228 (evidence admissible of physician\u2019s prior use of Valium injections to weaken female patients\u2019 resistance to abuse); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mamay, supra </em>at 416-417 (defendant, a gynecologist, employing unorthodox examination positions, fondled patients on the examination table); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Feijoo, </em>419 Mass. 486, 494-495 (1995) (karate instructor teaching adolescent boys that part of becoming a Ninja warrior involves ritual of participation in intimate relations with instructor). Apart from the cases involving an unusual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>or distinctive modus operandi (like <em>Helfant, Mamay </em>and Feijoo), the cases in which joinder was approved often emphasize proximity in time as a critical element. Thus, in <em>Gallison, </em>the court reasoned that the abuse of the younger brother of the victim named in the indictment a nine year old female was admissible because it was similar in pattern and occurred, over the same time period, thus \u201cform[ing] a temporal and schematic nexus with the treatment of [the sister].\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gallison, supra </em>at 673. The <em>King </em>decision, recognizing that it would be the first case in which that court permitted \u201cevidence of a defendant\u2019s sexual conduct with a child not named in the indictment [to be admitted] in an action charging a sexual offense against the named child\u201d <em>(Commonwealth </em>v. <em>King, supra </em>at 471), emphasized that the evidence fit the \u201ctemporal and schematic nexus\u201d formulation of <em>Gallison; </em>that is to say, \u201cboth children lived in the same house with the defendant, the sexual acts took place during the same time period, the victims were of similar age (both under ten), and the form of the sexual conduct (oral sex and use of the dog) was similar. These factors make this evidence distinguishable from the unconnected acts we excluded in <em>[Commonwealth </em>v.] <em>Welcome, </em>[348 Mass. 68, 70 (1964)].\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 472. The <em>King </em>decision reiterated that \u201cevidence of a separate sexual act with another person is inadmissible if it is unconnected in time, place, or other relevant circumstances to the particular sex offense for which the defendant is being tried,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 470, citing <em>Welcome, supra </em>at 70.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-6\">As joined, the instant case involved thirteen year old classmates of the defendant\u2019s daughter, Anne,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> who visited her and stayed overnight. The first to report improper activities to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>authorities was Kathy,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> allegedly molested the night of December 23-24, 1999. Kathy reported that during the afternoon, the defendant, alone with her in a small room, first grabbed her breast, and after having her count money, touched her side and slid his hand to her buttocks, pulled her toward him, then held her briefly. Later he drove Kathy and Anne to a fast-food restaurant and during the drive reached into the backseat to grab Kathy\u2019s legs. At some point he gave her twenty dollars. Back at home, he pulled her into the bathroom, touched her (through her clothing) on her breast, vaginal area, and buttocks, kissed her on the forehead, attempted to kiss her lips, then let her leave. That night, as Kathy was sleeping, fully clothed in the same bed with Anne, the defendant came in, woke her, and urged her without success to go downstairs with him. He then crawled on top of her three times, touching her breast and vaginal area. Kathy testified she could feel his penis through her clothing pressing against her buttocks. She disclosed these activities to her mother on December 24, but Kathy and her mother didn\u2019t approach authorities (first a school counselor, then the police) for several weeks.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-5\">The second complaint involved Rose,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> a friend of Anne\u2019s, who had slept over at the Pillai house often. Rose alleged that on one night in either July or August (i.e., four or five months prior to the incidents involving Kathy) she awoke around 2:30 a.m. to find the defendant, smelling of alcohol, hovering over her and feeling her breasts through a bra and T-shirt she was wearing. Even though she protested, the defendant persisted for a time in trying to lift her T-shirt. He then sat in the room and watched her for a while, even after she rolled over. Rose testified she told Anne several days later, who promptly changed the subject. (Anne denied being told.) Sometime after winter break, Rose learned from Anne that Kathy was making accusations against the defendant. Rose then talked to Kathy, who, although a schoolmate, was not previously an acquaintance. Rose volunteered that she too had been subject to the defendant\u2019s advances. Kathy encouraged Rose to \u201ccome forward\u201d and Rose <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>agreed.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Rose had not previously reported the events alleged, even to her family.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-5\">These cases should not have been joined for trial. Evidence of the defendant\u2019s conduct with Kathy would have been inadmissible in the case based on Rose\u2019s allegations; so too, evidence of his conduct with Rose, in the case based on Kathy\u2019s allegations. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Barrett, </em>418 Mass. 788, 794 (1994); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jacobs, 52 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 38, 42-43 (2001). In contrast to evidence of earlier bad acts involving the same parties, which is often \u201crelevant to show the probable existence of the same passion or emotion at the time in issue,\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>King, </em>387 Mass, at 470, quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bemis, </em>242 Mass. 582, 585 (1922), evidence of bad acts \u201cby the defendant toward a child other than the complainant . . . , to be admissible, must be closely related in time, place, and form of acts to show a common course of conduct by the defendant toward the two children so as to be logically probative.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Barrett, supra </em>at 794, citing the <em>King </em>and <em>Gallison </em>cases. \u201cIn other words, the conduct towards the children must form a \u2018temporal and schematic nexus\u2019 which renders the evidence admissible to show a common course of conduct regarding the two children.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cogswell, </em>31 Mass. App. Ct. 691, 696 (1991) (defendant abusing stepdaughters repeatedly, inducing silence by identical threats); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lanning, </em>32 Mass. App. Ct. 279, 283 (1992) (defendant, close family friend, in continuing pattern of sexual abuse of daughters from age nine on).</p>\n<p id=\"b641-6\">As the trial judge observed, there were many similarities between the alleged assaults against Kathy and Rose. The victims were both schoolmates of the defendant\u2019s daughter. Both were sleeping over at her house. Both were assaulted at roughly the same time at night, and the defendant\u2019s alleged advances in both cases consisted of fondling breasts, vaginal areas, and buttocks. \u201cThe alleged offenses and their circumstances were thus undoubtedly similar. . . in major respects. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>However, they were not \u2018related\u2019 within the meaning of Mass.R.Crim.P. 9(a)(1), unless the judge could conclude that they arose \u2018out of a course of criminal conduct or series of criminal episodes connected together or constituting parts of a single scheme or plan.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sylvester, </em>388 Mass. 749, 755 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b642-4\">The judge could not properly so conclude. The acts were plainly not a part of a single course of criminal conduct but rather were separate acts involving different victims four or five months apart. The acts were not connected together and were not part of a single scheme or plan. Nor did the evidence bring the case within the mold of the modus operandi, or pattern of conduct line of cases, such as <em>Helfant, </em>supra; <em>Mamay, supra; Feijoo, </em>supra; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Odell, </em>34 Mass. App. Ct. 100, 103 (1993) (defendant stupefying numerous women with drugs and alcohol), or <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hanlon, </em>44 Mass. App. Ct. 810, 819-821 (1998) (priest taking altar boys to ski lodge).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The defendant\u2019s acts with respect to Kathy and Rose did not exhibit any distinctive, identifying qualities such as those that are characteristic of the modus operandi or common pattern line of cases. To the contrary, his groping of breasts, vaginal areas, and buttocks, and trying to reach under clothing, are common to most indecent assault and battery cases. Compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Brusgulis, </em>406 Mass. 501, 506-507 (1990). Trying these two cases together, or admitting evidence of one in the other, would furnish evidence with no probative force other than to show the defendant\u2019s attraction to adolescent girls in others words, to show his propensity for committing the type of crime charged. This, all decisions agree, a court should not allow.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-5\">\n<em>Judgments reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b642-6\">\n<em>Verdicts set aside.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b639-7\">The <em>Welcome </em>case was a prosecution for the defendant\u2019s alleged indecent assault on a female child. The court reversed the conviction because the judge had admitted evidence that the defendant had previously assaulted other female children. \u201cWe invoke the rule that evidence of a distinct crime unconnected with that for which the defendant is indicted cannot be received. An exception to this rule is stated in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Machado, </em>339 Mass. 713 [1959], where there was evidence of prior illicit sexual intercourse between the same parties. In the present case the testimony related to earlier misconduct by the defendant with other parties.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Welcome, supra </em>at 70-71.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b639-9\">A pseudonym.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b640-6\">Also a pseudonym.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b640-7\">A pseudonym.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b641-7\">Rose testified: \u201cWell, our conversation kind of consisted of well, it happened to me, too, I told her; so you\u2019re not alone.
