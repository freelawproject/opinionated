In his appeal from that judgment, Robert contends that, apart from expenses of the son\u2019s private school, there was no evidence of increased costs to Carolyn of maintaining the children that could not be met out of her income, which had also increased, and that it was error of law to consider, as the Probate and Family Court judge did in this case, the disparity in the standards of living in each parent\u2019s household resulting from Robert\u2019s increased income. We conclude that the judge did not abuse her discretion by considering, as a component of the children\u2019s needs, Robert\u2019s increased income and his standard of living. We note that, in addition, the stipulated evidence, see note 2, <em>supra, </em>reflects that the actual expenses of the children had also increased.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-4\"><em>Facts and proceedings. </em>The parties are physicians and were employed full-time when they divorced and at the time of the modification proceeding. Prior to trial on Carolyn\u2019s complaint for modification they agreed that their son should continue to be enrolled in the boarding school in which Carolyn had enrolled him the preceding year, and that they each would contribute one half of the $27,000 total annual cost of tuition, fees, and room and board.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Their agreement on this point was later incorporated in the judgment of modification and does not survive the judgment as an independent contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-5\">With respect to the issue of increased child support, the probate judge found that, since the parties\u2019 divorce in December, 1996, Robert\u2019s annual income had more than doubled from $130,000 to $278,900 ($35,000 of which was deferred compensation) and that Carolyn\u2019s annual income, which was $145,000 at the time of the divorce, had increased to $192,000 (including $5,000 in pension contribution). The judge found <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"733\">*733</page-number>that as a result of Robert\u2019s increased income he was able \u201cto afford a new home and to amass significant cash assets to use for that purchase and for repeated travel with the children. He has taken flying lessons.\u201d While there are no explicit findings as to the increase in the children\u2019s expenses in addition to the cost of boarding school for the son, it is apparent from the record that the children now were taking music lessons, for which musical instruments were rented as well as purchased, and that they were attending summer camp.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Robert concedes in his brief that after \u201cdiscounting expenses arguably not a part of maintenance for the children,\u201d Carolyn\u2019s weekly expenses had increased by \u201c$549.13[, of which] $254.00 is the increased cost for the [son\u2019s] education.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b767-5\">The judge concluded that \u201c[t]he difference between the parties\u2019 salaries at the time of the hearing is itself a material change of circumstance,\u201d and that it was not in the best interests of the children to experience a disparity in the standards of living between the two parents\u2019 households. In addition, she based the increased award on the fact that the parties\u2019 agreement to contribute to the son\u2019s boarding school costs \u201cfalls unequally on them as a result of th[e] difference\u201d in their incomes.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-6\"><em>Discussion. </em>Robert does not directly argue that the Probate Court judge should be precluded from, in effect, modifying the parties\u2019 agreement to contribute equally to the son\u2019s private <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"734\">*734</page-number>school costs by ordering him to pay an amount that reimburses Carolyn for her share of this expense. He has not briefed the question of the extent to which a trial court should give effect to agreements governing support obligations and those in the nature of support (such as contributions to college, private school, or summer camp expenses) to which the Massachusetts Child Support Guidelines (guidelines) do not presumptively apply. Compare <em>Bercume </em>v. <em>Bercume, </em>428 Mass. 635, 644 (1999) (addressing alimony modification: \u201cA judge who modifies a divorce judgment does not write on a tabula rasa. To the extent possible, and consistent with common sense and justice, the modified judgment should take into account the earlier, expressed desires of the parties\u201d); <em>Downey </em>v. <em>Downey, </em>55 Mass. App. Ct. 812, 817 (2002). We need not decide this issue, however. Even assuming that the judge was required to give effect to the agreement, her findings, both explicit and implicit, and the stipulated facts support the result reached.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-4\">Robert argues that an order increasing child support based solely on his increased earnings constitutes an abuse of discretion in the absence of a showing that there was also an increase in the children\u2019s reasonable expenses, and that the increase here was improperly based on the trial judge\u2019s expressed \u201cconcern that one [household] is significantly better off than the other.\u201d Although the disparity in the standards of living between households was appropriately considered by the probate judge, the modification judgment was not based solely on this factor. Implicit in the judge\u2019s consideration of this disparity is consideration of the children\u2019s needs, defined in the light of Robert\u2019s higher standard of living.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-5\">A child support judgment may be modified on a finding \u201cthat a material and substantial change in the circumstances of the parties has occurred and the judgment of modification is necessary in the best interests of the children.\u201d G. L. c. 208, \u00a7 28, as amended by St. 1985, c. 490, \u00a7 1. \u201cOf the several factors which the judge may consider in modifying a decree for child support, . . . this court has never required that they be accorded equal weight or conjunctive application. In any given case the judge as fact finder may thus attribute greater significance to a change in the husband\u2019s net worth than to changes in the needs or life <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"735\">*735</page-number>style of the wife or children.\u201d <em>Heistand </em>v. <em>Heistand, </em>384 Mass. 20, 27 (1981). See <em>Buchanan </em>v. <em>Buchanan, </em>353 Mass. 351, 352 (1967) (in revising prior order of support, consideration is to be given to \u201cthe needs of the children, the financial status of the former husband, and the station in life of the respective parties\u201d); <em>Thompson </em>v. <em>Thompson, </em>12 Mass. App. Ct. 917, 918 (1981) (upholding modified alimony and child support based on former husband\u2019s increased income and assets; although former wife\u2019s income had also increased, it was still much less than that of former husband); <em>Fugere </em>v. <em>Fugere, </em>24 Mass. App. Ct. 758, 759-760 (1987), and cases cited. Compare <em>Parrish </em>v. <em>Parrish, </em>30 Mass. App. Ct. 78, 89 (1991) (modification judgment reversed because the judge\u2019s findings focused solely on the father\u2019s reduced income and failed to address \u201cneeds, requirements or standard of living\u201d of the mother or the parties\u2019 children). Thus, the fact that Carolyn\u2019s income had also increased and that she could pay the increased expenses of the children was not dispositive, particularly because the increase in her earnings was proportionately much less than that of Robert.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Cf. <em>Dennis </em>v. <em>Dennis, 29 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 161, 165 (1990) (evidence that the mother has been able to meet certain financial obligations since the divorce does not require finding that support presently available for children is adequate; \u201ca judge may consider a child\u2019s \u2018standard of living\u2019 in deciding whether the level of available support for that child is inadequate,\u201d quoting from <em>Ames </em>v. <em>Perry, </em>406 Mass. 236, 242 [1989]).</p>\n<p id=\"b770-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"736\">*736</page-number>Relying on <em>Pearson </em>v. Pearson, 52 Mass. App. Ct. 156 (2001), Robert argues that, with respect to high-income parents, upward modification based solely on increases in a noncustodial parent\u2019s income constitutes income-sharing and is disfavored, and that the focus should be on whether the \u201creasonable needs\u201d of the children are being met. <em>Id. </em>at 160-161 &amp; n.6. <em>Pearson </em>does not, however, preclude taking into account the higher standard of living of the noncustodial parent in determining a child\u2019s needs. That this is so may be seen in the decision of the Supreme Judicial Court in <em>Department of Rev. </em>v. <em>Mason M., </em>439 Mass. 665 (2003).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In that case, the court determined that the probate judge had improperly reduced child support below the minimum presumptive amount calculated on the basis of the maximum noncustodial parent income to which the guidelines were then applicable ($75,000), and that on remand, the probate judge was to order at least the minimum presumptive amount of child support and \u201cto consider the question of an additional sum based on [the child\u2019s] needs and the father\u2019s ability to pay more than the presumptive minimum level of support.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 677.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> This determination was made notwithstanding that the mother\u2019s stated expenses were less than this amount, <em>id. </em>at 668, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"737\">*737</page-number>and irrespective of the absence of a historically higher station in life enjoyed by the mother and child. The <em>Mason M. </em>case thus supports the proposition that, consistent with principles underlying the guidelines, children\u2019s needs are to be defined, at least in part, by their parents\u2019 standard of living and that children are entitled to participate in the noncustodial parent\u2019s higher standard of living when available resources permit.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Significant to the court\u2019s decision was the fact that \u201c[t]he guidelines were promulgated with several fundamental social policies in mind,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 669, two of which are relevant here: \u201c(1) to \u2018encourage joint parental responsibility for child support in proportion to, or as a percentage of income\u2019; [and] (2) to \u2018meet the child\u2019s survival needs in the first instance, but to the extent either parent enjoys a higher standard of living to entitle the child to enjoy that higher standard\u2019 .... Child Support Guidelines, preamble.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 669-670. In addition to the policies reiterated in the <em>Mason M. </em>case, the guidelines contain this relevant principle: \u201cTo provide the standard of living the child would have enjoyed had the family been intact.\u201d Child Support Guidelines, preamble.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-5\"><em>Conclusion. </em>Based on the foregoing, the Probate and Family Court judge appropriately considered Robert\u2019s enhanced standard of living and the resulting disparity in parental households. Implicit in the judge\u2019s order was a consideration of the children\u2019s needs in light of that disparity, as well as of the stipulated evidence reflecting that in the years since the divorce the oldest child had reached the age of thirteen (which, under the guidelines, would warrant an adjustment equal to ten percent of the support award), and that the children\u2019s expenses were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"738\">*738</page-number>greater as a result of music lessons and summer camp. It was well within the judge\u2019s discretion to increase support by $150 per week.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-4\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b765-15\">The oldest child, a daughter, was bom December 30, 1987; the parties\u2019 son was born July 10, 1989; their three younger daughters were born December 24, 1990; March 11, 1992; and May 20, 1994.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b766-6\">By agreement of the parties, the \u201ctrial\u201d proceeded on the arguments of counsel, agreed-to exhibits, and stipulations of the parties.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b766-7\">In light of the parties\u2019 resolution of this issue, we do not recite the alleged bases for this aspect of the modification request, except to note that it appears to have been in response to special needs of the child not shared by the other children, all of whom continue to attend public school. It is apparent from the record that the parties were assisted by a parenting mediator or monitor in resolving the issue of their son\u2019s enrollment in boarding school.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b767-7\">Camp and music lessons were not listed as expenses on Carolyn\u2019s financial statement at the time of the divorce, although she did indicate that the average cost of \u201cchildren\u2019s lessons\u201d was $50 per week. In a financial statement filed during the pendency of the modification action, Carolyn\u2019s listed expenses include $124.50 per week for children\u2019s music lessons, $40.63 per week for children\u2019s instrument rentals, and $169.59 per week for children\u2019s summer camps.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-8\">The fact that Carolyn\u2019s financial statement reflects expenses actually being incurred has some bearing on the issue, but is not alone dispositive. We recognize that some custodial parents are not in a position to incur financial obligations on behalf of their children in the absence of an order that will require at least some contribution from the noncustodial parent. Significant to the determination of this case, involving as it does very high income parents, is that the expenses were for such life-enhancing activities as summer camp and music lessons which are reasonable and appropriate to the standard of living enjoyed by Robert, whether or not Carolyn had already incurred the expense. Expenses as reported by the custodial parent are not necessarily indicative of the children\u2019s needs. See note 8, <em>infra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b769-4\">American Law Institute commentary notes that among the values sought to be addressed by formulas for child support based upon a percentage of income, such as the guidelines, is the interest of the custodial parent \u201cin not being disadvantaged, as compared to the child\u2019s other parent, by the financial opportunity costs of [custodial] responsibility, that is, by the amount, if any, by which [custodial] responsibility for a child diminishes that parent\u2019s earning capacity.\u201d American Law Institute (ALI) Principles of the Law of Family Dissolution: Analysis and Recommendations \u00a7 3.04 comment e, at 426 (2002). See <em>id. </em>\u00a7 3.04 comments b, c, d &amp; f, at 424-428.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-5\">We also note that, whereas Robert\u2019s increased income permitted him to make contributions to his retirement account in the amount of $30,000 per year, Carolyn\u2019s contributions were limited to $5,000 per year. According to the parties\u2019 financial statements, Robert increased the amount he expended on vacations, from $5,200 a year at the time of the divorce to $15,000 at the time of the modification. Carolyn decreased spending on vacations from $2,600 to $2,132 per year.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b770-4\">In <em>Department of Rev. </em>v. <em>Mason M., </em>439 Mass, at 666, the probate judge ordered support in the context of an adjudication of paternity of an out-of-wedlock child. The father (a physician who was married and had two marital children) had annual income of $104,408, which exceeded the income level to which the guidelines were then applicable. <em>Id. </em>at 667 &amp; n.6. At the time of the paternity judgment that ordered support, the mother (of the child who was the subject of the action) was unemployed and receiving public assistance. <em>Id. </em>at 666-667. The judge calculated weekly presumptive minimum child support due under the guidelines to be $389.42, but reduced that amount by a hypothetical sum needed for the support of the father\u2019s wife and two marital children. <em>Id. </em>at 667-668 &amp; n.7, 670-671. The Supreme Judicial Court reasoned that the hypothetical amount needed to support his wife and marital children \u201ccould be fully satisfied from the father\u2019s excess income above $75,000,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 672, further noting that \u201cit is neither unreasonable nor unjust to require noncustodial parents to adjust their monthly expenses in order to provide for the support of their minor children in a manner that will best serve their welfare.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b770-5\">Also on appeal in that case was the dismissal of a complaint for modification brought by the Department of Revenue on behalf of the mother and the Department of Transitional Assistance, following entry of the paternity judgment. The father\u2019s wife \u2014 also a physician \u2014 had returned to work, and thus, the court concluded, it was a genuine issue of material fact whether this meant that there would be additional income for the support of the marital <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"737\">*737</page-number>children, thereby making more of the father\u2019s income available for the support of the subject child. <em>Department of Rev. </em>v. <em>Mason M., </em>439 Mass, at 674.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b771-8\">This higher standard includes the ability to provide certain opportunities (such as private school education; specialized training in music, art, or sports; summer camps; and cultural travel), at least if a child would likely have enjoyed those opportunities had the child lived with the noncustodial parent.
