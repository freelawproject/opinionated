O\u2019Leary, an attorney, appeals pro se from an order of a single justice of this court affirming the June 23, 2003, order of a Superior Court judge, allowing attorney\u2019s fees and costs to The Education Resources Institute, Inc. (TERI), pursuant to G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 6F. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-15\">TERI is a nonprofit Massachusetts corporation that guarantees, pursuant to the Private Law Access Supplemental Loan Program, private educational loans made by private lending <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>institutions. In 1993, O\u2019Leary defaulted on two promissory notes for educational loans he had received. Pursuant to its guaranty, TERI paid the lender the full balance of both notes, including accrued, past due interest. TERI had no record of any request by O\u2019Leary for loan consolidation.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-5\">In September, 1996, TERI brought an action against O\u2019Leary in the Pittsfield Division of the District Court Department (District Court) to collect monies due as a result of his defaulting on the promissory notes. Pursuant to Mass.R.Civ.P. 55, as amended, 423 Mass. 1402 (1996), a default judgment entered against O\u2019Leary in February, 1998, followed by an assessment of damages, a judgment, and the issuance of an execution. Over two and one-half years later, in response to a supplementary process action brought by TERI, O\u2019Leary filed a motion to vacate and set aside the default judgment under Mass.R.Civ.P. 60(b)(4) and (6), 365 Mass. 828 (1974). On November 7, 2000, a District Court judge denied O\u2019Leary\u2019s motion, concluding that the default judgment was proper and valid, and that O\u2019Leary\u2019s motion was untimely.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On March 8, 2001, O\u2019Leary attempted to resurrect the substance of his motion to vacate by filing six additional motions with the District Court, each of which was denied, with the judge noting that they were \u201cwithout merit\u201d and \u201cperilously close to being frivolous, especially since [O\u2019Leary] is an attorney.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b688-6\">On February 11, 2002, O\u2019Leary commenced this action against TERI and others in the Superior Court, alleging that they had engaged in negligent and fraudulent acts intended to mislead and deceive him regarding the repayment and consolidation of his student loans.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> A judge of that court treated TERI\u2019s motion to dismiss the claims against it as a motion for summary judgment and allowed the motion. Further, after finding that O\u2019Leary\u2019s action was contrary to clearly established law, see <em>Air Purchases, Inc. </em>v. <em>Mechanical Coordinators Corp., </em>21 Mass. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>App. Ct. 632, 633 (1986), and was wholly insubstantial, frivolous, and not advanced in good faith, the judge allowed TERI\u2019s request for attorney\u2019s fees and costs under G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 6F. Following the submission of a \u201cCertificate of Attorneys Fees,\u201d the judge concluded that TERI was reasonably entitled to recover $12,754.44. A single justice of this court affirmed the order of the Superior Court as to the allowance of fees and costs, and the present appeal ensued.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-4\">Pursuant to G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 6F, a Superior Court judge may award attorney\u2019s fees and costs upon a finding \u201cthat all or substantially all of the claims, defenses, setoffs or counterclaims, whether of a factual, legal or mixed nature, made by any party <em>who was represented by counsel </em>during most or all of the proceeding, were wholly insubstantial, frivolous and not advanced in good faith\u201d (emphasis added). O\u2019Leary maintains that there is no case authority to support the proposition that an attorney who represents himself, rather than employing independent counsel, is subject to G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 6F. \u201cThe absence of such a decision speaks to the self-evident nature of the conclusion.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cohen, </em>55 Mass. App. Ct. 358, 359 (2002). We agree with the single justice that because O\u2019Leary was himself an attorney at all relevant times, he was plainly \u201crepresented by counsel\u201d within the meaning of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-5\">O\u2019Leary is hard pressed to deny that the \u201cadvice and participation of counsel was available to him\u201d throughout the proceeding. See <em>Massachusetts Adventura Travel, Inc. </em>v. <em>Mason, </em>27 Mass. App. Ct. 293, 299 (1989). Indeed, it cannot be gainsaid that an attorney who represents himself has experience, training, knowledge of relevant circumstances, and access to the advice of counsel far beyond that of a lay person. The fact that O\u2019Leary chose to represent himself, as he was qualified to do given his legal education and training, rather than retain independent counsel, does not nullify his status as a lawyer advocating his own interests. See, e.g., G. L. c. 221, \u00a7 38 (oath of office for lawyer); Mass.R.Prof.C. 3.1, 426 Mass. 1381 (1998) (lawyer should only file meritorious claims and contentions). While the wisdom of such self-representation is an altogether different <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>matter, it does not alter our conclusion that O\u2019Leary\u2019s conduct fell within the purview of G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 6F.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b690-4\">O\u2019Leary also has argued that the amount of attorney\u2019s fees and costs awarded to TERI was exorbitant. However, he has failed to rebut the affidavit submitted by TERI documenting its fees and costs incurred from April, 2002, through March, 2003, in defending itself against O\u2019Leary\u2019s cause of action, and has failed to demonstrate that the amount was unreasonable in the circumstances of this case. We discern no error of law or abuse of discretion in the single justice\u2019s conclusion that TERI was entitled to recover such reasonable attorney\u2019s fees and costs where the motion judge properly determined that O\u2019Leary\u2019s claims against TERI were wholly insubstantial, frivolous, and not advanced in good faith. See <em>Masterpiece Kitchen &amp; Bath, Inc. </em>v. <em>Gordon, </em>425 Mass. 325, 330 (1997); <em>Pirie </em>v. <em>First Congregational Church, </em>43 Mass. App. Ct. 908, 909, 911 (1997).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b690-5\">\n<em>Order of single justice affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b688-7\">A single justice of the Supreme Judicial Court denied O\u2019Leary\u2019s petition for review filed pursuant to G.
