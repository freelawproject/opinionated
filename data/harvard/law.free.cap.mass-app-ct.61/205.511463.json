The Massachusetts Legislature felt compelled to enact a statute proscribing the possession of \u201cany bomb or other high explosive,\u201d see G. L. c. 148, \u00a7 35, as early as 1847 when it gave cities and towns the power to regulate substances used as explosives, St. 1847, c. 51; and in 1930 saw the need for a separate statute criminalizing the possession of any \u201cinfernal machine . . . including] any device for endangering life or doing unusual damage to property, or both, by explosion\u201d (now G. L. c. 266, \u00a7 102A, as amended by St. 1970, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>c. 422). The defendant, Gregory W. Carter, here challenges his May, 2001, conviction for violating \u00a7 102A, contending that the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence fell short of proving that what he possessed constituted an infernal machine.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-4\">Carter\u2019s conviction resulted from the following circumstances. Dissatisfied with various aspects of a residential property he had purchased from one Michael Neilson, Carter issued several threats against Neilson for failure to redress the problems Carter perceived. The threats included attacking Neilson with a substance Carter boasted he possessed, identified as \u201cC-4 plastic explosive,\u201d and blowing up Neilson\u2019s house. After Carter physically confronted Neilson in the latter\u2019s home with (according to Neilson) a long knife and renewed threats of similar nature, the local police intervened at Neilson\u2019s behest. They arrested Carter and searched his property (pursuant to a warrant) for the C-4 explosive he claimed to possess. In the course of the search, police officers found marijuana plants growing outside of Carter\u2019s house. In one drawer of a two-drawer metal cabinet outside the master bedroom, they discovered a \u201cbrick-shaped\u201d block of C-4 explosive in a nylon bag, as well as a small plastic container holding ten percussion blasting caps. The container holding the blasting caps was located in a different part of the drawer, separated from the block by tools and other items.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b240-5\">Carter was indicted for armed home invasion, armed assault with intent to murder, unlawful cultivation of marijuana, and (most pertinent to this appeal) possession of an infernal machine. A Superior Court jury acquitted him of armed home invasion and armed assault with intent to murder, but convicted him of unlawful cultivation of marijuana and possession of an infernal machine. Carter\u2019s main argument on appeal<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> is that the trial judge erred in denying his motion for a required finding of not guilty on the infernal machine possession charge because the Commonwealth\u2019s proof failed to establish that he possessed an infernal machine within the meaning of G. L. c. 266, \u00a7 102A.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-6\">Carter contends that the Commonwealth needed to prove that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>he was in possession of a fully-assembled machine or device rather than merely the separate component parts (C-4 explosive and blasting caps) found in his drawer which had not yet been sufficiently integrated to constitute an infernal machine that could destroy or injure by fire or explosion. The Commonwealth counters that the statute contains no requirement that the forbidden device be fully assembled and ready to detonate, and it need merely be potentially destructive whenever combined, relying on the language in the next-to-last sentence, \u201cwhether or not contrived to ignite or explode automatically.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b241-4\">General Laws, c. 266, \u00a7 102A (set out in its entirety in the margin<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>), did not generate any legislative history clarifying its intent and scope. It remains sui generis<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and has been discussed little in appellate opinions.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Contrary to both parties\u2019 shared underlying assumption that the statutory language is clear, exactly what is to be understood by the quaintly archaic term \u201cinfernal machine\u201d is not comprehensible to a person of ordinary intelligence simply by reading the statute. Although it appears in dictionaries, the term is not one encountered in everyday usage.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> It is undefined in \u00a7 102A, which merely purports to provide examples of the kind of \u201cmachine\u201d or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>\u201cdevice\u201d proscribed by reference to the injurious consequences of its use rather than by a description or explanation of its essential characteristics.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Its synonyms in \u00a7 102A \u2014 \u201cinstrument, contrivance or device\u201d \u2014 are similarly undefined, and their dictionary definitions provide relatively little assistance, because each word is circularly described in terms or as a species of the others.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b242-5\">We are thus dealing with a statute that must be deemed ambiguous, not merely because of the difficulties presented in penetrating the meaning of its unusual, seemingly anachronistic central term, \u201cinfernal machine,\u201d but also because that critical term can plausibly be understood \u2014 and has been by the parties \u2014 in at least two different senses. See <em>AT&amp;T </em>v. <em>Automatic Sprinkler Appeals Bd.., </em>52 Mass. App. Ct. 11, 14 (2001). See also <em>New England Med. Center Hosp., Inc. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Rev., </em>381 Mass. 748, 750 (1980) (a statute is unambiguous if virtually all reasonable people would fairly attribute only one meaning to it and would consider alternative meanings strained, far-fetched, unusual, or unlikely). We are persuaded on the basis of several factors that Carter\u2019s position, that the infernal machine condemned by \u00a7 102A must be an assembled object, rather than separate detached parts, should prevail.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>Although we are hindered in applying the usual tests for resolving ambiguity,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> the language used in \u00a7 102A does afford insights that point to resolution of its appropriate meaning.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-4\">First, the very singularity of each term used \u2014 \u201can infernal machine\u201d or \u201ca similar instrument, contrivance or device\u201d \u2014 connotes something that constitutes an individual object, whether inherently unitary or rendered so by the integration of several objects. None of the terms logically gives rise to an image of discrete, disconnected components that are scattered or physically separated from each other.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-5\">Moreover, the principal dictionary definitions of the most significant term, \u201cmachine,\u201d lend support to the conception of an \u201cinfernal machine\u201d as consisting of one, not several, things. See Webster\u2019s Third New Intl. Dictionary 1353 (3d ed. 1993) (\u201cmachine . . . (1): <em>an assemblage of parts . </em>. . that transmit forces, motion, and energy one to another in some predetermined manner and to some desired end\u201d) (emphasis added); The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language 1047 (4th ed. 2000) (\u201cmachine ... 1a. A <em>device consisting of fixed and moving parts </em>that modifies mechanical energy and transmits it in a more useful form\u201d) (emphasis added). See also The Columbia Encyclopedia 1706 (6th ed. 2000) (\u201cmachine . . . <em>arrangement of moving and stationary mechanical parts </em>used to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>perform some useful work\u201d) (emphasis added).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b244-4\">More significantly in favor of Carter\u2019s position is the well-established rule of lenity consisting of interrelated principles mandating that \u201ccriminal statutes are to be construed narrowly,\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kerr, </em>409 Mass. 284, 286 (1991), and \u201cstrictly against the Commonwealth,\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Wotan, </em>422 Mass. 740, 742 (1996), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gagnon, </em>387 Mass. 567, 569, <em>S.C., </em>387 Mass. 768 (1982), cert, denied, 461 U.S. 921, and cert, denied, 464 U.S. 815 (1983); and that \u201c[w]e must resolve in favor of criminal defendants any reasonable doubt as to [a] statute\u2019s meaning,\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Connolly, </em>394 Mass. 169, 174 (1985), to the end that \u201c[i]f the statutory language \u2018can plausibly be found to be ambiguous,\u2019 . . . the defendant [must] be given \u2018the benefit of the ambiguity,\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Carrion, </em>431 Mass. 44, 45-46 (2000), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Roucoulet, </em>413 Mass. 647, 652 (1992). In short, we must resolve any doubt that lingers as to the reach of an ambiguous criminal statute in favor of a defendant, that is, against finding a criminal violation. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gagnon, supra </em>at 569. See also <em>Rewis </em>v. <em>United States, </em>401 U.S. 808, 812 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b244-6\">As applied to the facts of this case, the rule of lenity, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>combined with the singular number of the key terms in the statute, the most common concept of a \u201cmachine\u201d as something whole made up of constituent parts, and the Legislature\u2019s failure to adopt the specificity of the cognate Federal statute, persuades us that what the Commonwealth proved Carter possessed cannot unambiguously be said to be an infernal machine of the sort penalized by \u00a7 102A. The statute cannot be construed to criminalize the possession of discrete, unconnected, and physically separated items that represent, at most, parts and materials that might potentially be assembled into an infernal machine or similar device capable of exploding or igniting but have not been so integrated and converted yet. The ordinary citizen would undoubtedly be astonished to learn that his possession of separate items of potentially explosive or inflammatory materials, particularly items that have legitimate social utility other than as destructive weaponry<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> \u2014 such as gasoline or kerosene, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>old rags, matches, and empty bottles stored in his garage or basement<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> \u2014 would expose him to a ten-year prison sentence.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b246-4\">The lack of any reported cases, in the almost seventy-five year history of the statute, suggesting (much less holding) that several unconnected objects even in relative proximity can constitute an infernal machine is not without significance. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sexton, </em>41 Mass. App. Ct. 676, 679-680 (1996), <em>S.C., </em>425 Mass. 146 (1997). Of greater force is the fact that the few cases mentioning \u00a7 102A buttress the construction that requires an infernal machine to be some form of integration or assembly of critical component parts into a single device.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-5\">In the only decision expressly addressing the issue, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bushway, </em>7 Mass. App. Ct. 715 (1979), the defendant had poured gasoline from a plastic jug into several lightweight plastic trash bags tied with a knot at the top. <em>Id. </em>at 716. Expert testimony established that such packaging encouraged vaporization of the gasoline and expansion of the bags to a volatile and dangerous condition, needing only the presence of a heat or ignition source to explode. <em>Id. </em>at 717. In upholding the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>defendant\u2019s conviction for possession of an infernal machine, this court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b247-4\">\u201c[W]e have no trouble concluding that the evidence in this case was sufficient for the jury to find that a lightweight plastic bag tied with a knot and partially filled with gasoline was a \u2018device\u2019 under G. L. c. 266, \u00a7 102A, <em>since it was a piece of equipment put together to serve a particular purpose. . . . </em>The defendant maintains that in order to constitute \u2018devices,\u2019 the bags <em>must be shown to have been assembled </em>according to an inventive scheme for the purpose of performing a physical task. The judge [correctly] recognized the validity of that contention and instructed the jury to that effect when he told them, <em>l[I]t must be something which is made. It cannot be simply one element. It must consist of more than one part </em>in order to be a device, instrument or machine or contrivance [under \u00a7 102A].\u2019 We are not compelled ... to adopt a definition of the word \u2018device\u2019 which confines its application to intricate contrivances.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b247-6\"><em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bushway, </em>7 Mass. App. Ct. at 717-718.</p>\n<p id=\"ADp\">The facts in the other cases involving convictions under \u00a7 102A lend support to the conclusions of <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bushway, supra, </em>that an infernal machine must be \u201ca piece of equipment put together,\u201d a device \u201cshown to have been assembled,\u201d \u201csomething which is made . . . consisting] of more than one part.\u201d In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kennedy, </em>360 Mass. 859 (1971) (in which the defense was that the defendant did not possess the guilty object), the device (as described in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bushway, supra </em>at 717) was \u201can explosive pyrotechnical bomb shell. . . [that] contained explosive powder.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b247-9\">The device in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lombardo, </em>23 Mass. App. Ct. 1006 (1987) (in which the defendant asserted that his guilty plea was invalid because the judge never explained the allegedly essential element of intent<footnotemark>14</footnotemark>), was a similar combination: a \u201ccigarette package, filled with explosive gunpowder.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>1007. Also composed of several parts was the infernal machine that the defendant in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Chase, </em>26 Mass. App. Ct. 578 (1988), was convicted of possessing (a conviction he did not directly challenge): \u201cthe device . . . consisted of two propane canisters, connected to two telephone books by means of masking tape and a coat hanger wire, and a flammable agent, epoxy thinner.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 579. In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>DeCicco, </em>44 Mass. App. Ct. 111 (1998) (in which the defendant claimed numerous errors but none relating to \u00a7 102A), the infernal machine was a \u201cMolotov cocktail\u201d \u201cfire bomb\u201d that \u201cwas made\u201d by the defendant by filling a bottle with methanol, then stuffing a rag and matches into the bottle. <em>Id. </em>at 114, 115. Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cotto, </em>52 Mass. App. Ct. 225, 226 (2001) (defendant, charged with numerous crimes not including a violation of \u00a7 102A, illegally broke into a home by throwing through a window an \u201cinfernal machine,\u201d consisting of \u201ca white plastic bottle . . . [that] contained gasoline\u201d).<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b248-5\"><em>Conclusion. </em>Under settled principles of statutory construction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>and the guidance of prior case law, the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence that Carter stored a brick of C-4 explosive in a drawer, and blasting caps nearby in a separate box, did not establish that he possessed an infernal machine in violation of G. L. c. 266, \u00a7 102A.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Carter\u2019s motion for a required finding of not guilty as to the charge of violating \u00a7 102A should, therefore, have been allowed.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b249-5\">The judgment of conviction on the possession of an infernal machine charge is reversed, the verdict is set aside, and judgment is to be entered for the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b240-7\">The record does not provide the dimensions of either the metal cabinet or the drawer in which the C-4 explosive and blasting caps were found.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b240-8\">Carter does not challenge his arrest, the search of his property, or his marijuana conviction on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b241-5\">\u201cWhoever, other than a police or other law enforcement officer acting in the discharge of his official duties, has in his possession or under his control an infernal machine or a similar instrument, contrivance or device shall be punished by imprisonment in the state prison for not more than ten years or in jail for not more than two and one half years, or by a fine of not more than one thousand dollars, or by both such fine and imprisonment, and the said machine, instrument, contrivance or device shall be forfeited to the commonwealth.

Unfortunately, as to G.

Section 921(a)(4) states that a \u201cdestructive device\u201d means \u201c(A) any explosive, incendiary, or poison gas (i) bomb, ... or (vi) device similar to any of the devices described in the preceding clauses; . . . and (C) <em>any combination of parts </em>either designed or intended for use in converting any device into any destructive device described in subparagraph (A) or (B) and <em>from which a destructive device may be readily assembled\u201d </em>(emphasis added).

The expert testimony did not, however, establish that the two objects discovered in separate areas of the metal cabinet drawer posed any threat in situ of explosion or ignition without additional assembly and at least one additional component. The C-4 explosive, which the searching police had been most concerned about, was extremely stable, \u201cuser friendly,\u201d and incapable of exploding without having a detonator and fuse attached. Moving it, dropping it, throwing it, or even burning it would not cause it \u201cto go off.\u201d Although the expert stated that the blasting caps were highly sensitive and had to be gingerly handled, he did not offer any testimony indicating that the caps, as found in a separate container in the drawer (a container which the expert recognized to be a specially designed case for holding blasting caps), would have been capable of detonating the C-4 explosive as it lay inside the nylon bag some distance away from the case of caps. He testified that the preferred method of setting off C-4 explosive was by inserting a blasting cap into the plastic explosive, adding a fuse, and then lighting it. Even though a blasting cap is highly sensitive to shock and could detonate if dropped from waist high, no evidence was presented that if a blasting cap were so dropped near a block of C-4 explosive it would detonate the C-4 explosive. The expert predicted detonation only if the cap were \u201cembedded into the C-4.\u201d Notwithstanding the expert\u2019s expressed concerns about the volatility of blasting caps and the inadvisability of transporting them without extreme precautions, the searching police had picked up the box of caps from the metal cabinet outside the bedroom, opened it to see what its contents were, then car-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>tied the caps, along with the C-4 explosive, to the entranceway to Carter\u2019s house, where they had placed the items on the floor, all without incident.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b246-7\">Compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>DeCicco, </em>44 Mass.

See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>395 Mass. 302, 303-304 (1985). \u201c[N]o one may be required at peril of life, liberty or property to speculate as to the meaning of penal statutes.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Batchelder, </em>442 U.S. 114, 123 (1979), quoting from <em>Lanzetta </em>v. <em>New Jersey, </em>306 U.S. 451, 453 (1939).

Carter\u2019s undeveloped argument that his motion for a required finding of not guilty should have been allowed because there was no proof of intent on his part to use the concealed explosive against Neilson, or anyone else, is based on the premise that at least the C-4 explosive was an item having \u201cbenign\u201d uses (see note 11, <em>supra); </em>but even if intent is a necessary element to be proved by the Commonwealth, the defendant\u2019s contention founders on the evidentiary fact that he not only possessed what the Commonwealth claims was an infernal machine but also threatened at least twice to use \u201cit\u201d to blow up Neilson. The issue is nonetheless moot under the rationale of our decision.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b248-7\">We find unpersuasive the Commonwealth\u2019s reliance on the words in the next-to-last sentence of \u00a7 102A: \u201c[t]he term \u2018infernal machine\u2019 . . . shall include any device for endangering life or doing unusual damage to property, or both, by fire or, explosion, whether or not contrived to ignite or explode automatically.\u201d G.
