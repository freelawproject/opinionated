L. c. 90, \u00a7 24.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The main issue on appeal is the propriety of using a New Hampshire \u201cconviction\u201d as one of the prior offenses. We hold that it was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-5\"><em>Facts. </em>On November 24, 2001, at 1:20 a.m., Newburyport police Officer Kevin Martin observed the defendant, Thomas Flaherty, driving sixty miles per hour in a thirty-five mile per hour zone and swerving erratically across the road\u2019s center lane line. Martin followed the defendant\u2019s vehicle for approximately one-quarter mile before activating his police cruiser\u2019s lights and siren. Despite the flashing lights and siren, the defendant did not stop the car he was driving until he reached his home, approximately three-quarters mile from the exit ramp where Martin first observed the defendant\u2019s speeding vehicle. Martin then administered field sobriety tests to the defendant, which he failed.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-6\">After booking, the defendant was placed in a holding cell, whereupon he complained of chest pains, necessitating a trip to the hospital, where he was treated and released.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-7\">He appeals, claiming that (1) a prior New Hampshire offense resulted in neither a conviction nor a court assignment for treatment, and thus cannot serve as a predicate offense under G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 24(1)(a)(1); (2) the prosecutor erroneously used a police report written by a nontestifying booking officer; and (3) the hospital records from the night of his arrest should have been admitted in evidence, as they were exculpatory in that they did not contain any reference to his being intoxicated.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-8\">1. <em>The out-of-State charge. </em>Under Massachusetts law, the defendant is guilty as a fourth time offender \u201c[i]f the defendant has been previously convicted or assigned to an alcohol or controlled substance education, treatment, or rehabilitation program by a court of the commonwealth or any other jurisdiction because of a like offense three times preceding the date of the commission of the offense for which he has been convicted . . . .\u201d G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 24(1)(a)(1), as appearing in St. 1999, c. 127, \u00a7 108, 109.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-9\">The prior charge at issue occurred on December 12, 1998, in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"778\">*778</page-number>Rochester, New Hampshire.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On January 4, 1999, the defendant pleaded guilty to driving under the influence of liquor, in violation of N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 265:82.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Pursuant to N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 265:82-b, 1(a), \u201c[a]ny person who is <em>convicted </em>of any offense under . . . [N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. \u00a7] 265:82 shall be: (1) Guilty of a violation . . . .\u201d (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b812-4\">Further, under New Hampshire practice, \u201c[u]pan conviction of a violation of [N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. \u00a7] 265:79, 82 or 82-a, the court shall report to the department [of motor vehicles] and shall immediately revoke the license or driving privilege of the person so convicted. . . .\u201d N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 263:65. In order to have the license reinstated, one must furnish \u201cproof of successful completion of an impaired driver intervention program\u201d to the motor vehicle registry. N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 263:65-a(I).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b812-5\">The defendant claims that neither prong of our statute is met; that is, (1) the defendant here was not \u201cpreviously convicted,\u201d but rather was merely \u201cguilty of a violation\u201d pursuant to N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 265:82-b; and (2) it is the New Hampshire registry, not the court, which requires the completion of an alcohol program.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-6\">It appears that under New Hampshire law, the defendant was convicted. Although the preference is to treat the conviction as a violation for sentencing purposes, such treatment does not detract from the fact that the defendant was previously convicted. As indicated, the law reads \u201c[a]ny person who is convicted of any offense under . . . [N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann \u00a7] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"779\">*779</page-number>265:82 shall be: (1) Guilty of a violation . . . .\u201d N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 265:82-b, 1(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b813-5\">Our view is buttressed by the language in <em>State </em>v. <em>Parmenter, </em>149 N.H. 40, 46 (2002), where New Hampshire\u2019s Supreme Court indicated that \u201c[t]he plain language of these statutes makes clear that if a person is <em>convicted </em>of [driving while under the influence of alcohol], first offense, a court will impose a fine and license suspension within the statutory limits\u201d (emphasis added). Lastly, we note that the plea tender sheet indicates that \u201ca conviction will be entered against me.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b813-6\">We conclude, therefore, that the New Hampshire offense was a conviction for G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 24, purposes.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b813-7\">2. <em>The police report. </em>On direct examination, Martin testified, in part, that the defendant was antagonistic and disruptive, and did not indicate that he had any medical problems. In an apparent attempt to impeach the witness, defense counsel repeatedly made reference to the alcohol influence report of a second, non-testifying officer, Officer Chelmo, which indicated that the defendant was \u201ccooperative and polite\u201d during the booking process and had previously suffered a broken foot. Further, defense counsel sought to have Martin admit that in the section of the report describing the defendant\u2019s actions, a box marked \u201cstaggering\u201d had not been checked.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b813-8\">On redirect examination, presumably in an attempt to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"780\">*780</page-number>rehabilitate his witness, the prosecutor questioned Martin concerning Chelmo\u2019s written observations regarding the defendant\u2019s symptoms of intoxication, clothing, and speech.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-4\">The use of the report by both parties was error. On cross-examination, it did not serve as fodder for impeachment purposes. That the defendant was polite with booking officer Chelmo does not impeach Martin\u2019s testimony that the defendant was not polite with him earlier that night. Perhaps feeling he had to fight fire with fire, the prosecutor then engaged in further inappropriate use of the report, pointing out sections which supported Martin\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-5\">On appeal, the Commonwealth contends that its use of the report was permissible under the doctrine of verbal completeness. \u201cThe purpose of the doctrine is to prevent one party from presenting a fragmented and misleading version of events by requiring the admission of other relevant portions of the same statement or writing which serve to clarify the context of the admitted portion.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Eugene, </em>438 Mass. 343, 351 (2003) (citations and internal quotations omitted). \u201cThe portion of the statement sought to be introduced must \u2018qualify or explain the segment\u2019 previously introduced.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Richardson, </em>59 Mass. App. Ct. 94, 99 (2003), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Leftwich, </em>430 Mass. 865, 872 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b814-6\">Here, clearly the statements the prosecutor sought to introduce did not clarify, qualify, or explain what defense counsel had earlier elicited. Indeed, if we were to accept the Commonwealth\u2019s liberal interpretation of the rule, once a party used one aspect of a police report or grand jury minutes, then theoretically the entire report would be subject to admission in evidence. This is not the state of the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-7\">As there was no objection, we assess whether its use constituted a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice in the context in which it occurred. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kilburn, </em>438 Mass. 356, 360-361 (2003). It did not.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-8\">The prosecutor\u2019s use of portions of the report was cumulative of Martin\u2019s testimony regarding the defendant\u2019s demeanor and behavior. During direct examination, Martin testified as to the defendant\u2019s \u201cwalking very unsteady ... all over the place\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"781\">*781</page-number>with \u201ca very strong odor of alcohol coming from his breath. His eyes were blood-shot. He was very unsteady on his feet. Again, staggering. And I noticed that he just couldn\u2019t stand still.\u201d When the defendant started to walk away, the officer had to tell him to stop and return. When asked why he did not stop, the defendant replied, \u201cI was just going to see a friend.\u201d When asked who, he responded, \u201cI forget.\u201d His performance on the field sobriety tests revealed that the defendant was very unsteady and lost his balance multiple times.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-5\">The prosecutor used the report to establish that the defendant\u2019s speech was \u201cstuddered <em>[sic] </em>and confused\u201d; that he was unsteady and had a strong odor of alcohol; and that his clothes looked \u201cmussed and soiled.\u201d On direct examination, Martin described the clothes as \u201cmessy,\u201d \u201cwith stains,\u201d and \u201cdirty,\u201d all points previously testified to.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-6\">Under these circumstances we cannot say that there was a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice, especially since the defense was also able to improperly use the report to its advantage.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Given the not guilty verdict on the second charge, it further appears that the jury was able to properly assess its role.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-7\">3. <em>The medical records. </em>The defendant argues that his hospital records from the night of his arrest should have been admitted as evidence at trial under G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 79, as an exception to the hearsay rule.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Moran, 439 Mass. 482 (2003),<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> the defendant asserts that because the records did not contain any reference or notation to his having been intoxicated, the records were exculpatory.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"782\">*782</page-number>The trial judge ruled that the defendant\u2019s hospital records could not be admitted in evidence without a predicate basis. The judge was concerned that as observations of intoxication were not the focus of the hospital visit, the records could be misleading. More importantly, counsel was given the opportunity to call hospital personnel as witnesses to testify whether there was such an evidentiary basis, and whether the defendant showed signs of having used alcohol earlier that night,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> which counsel declined. Lastly, the defendant was arrested at approximately 1:30 a.m., and began complaining of chest pains at around 4:00 a.m., at which point the paramedics were called and the defendant was transported to the hospital, where he remained for \u201cat least an hour, hour and a half.\u201d Given the passage of time, and the reasons noted above, as cited by the judge, it was within her discretion to refuse to allow the introduction of the medical records.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b811-10\">He was found not guilty of refusing to submit to a police officer, G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 25. After the operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol conviction, he waived a jury trial, and was found guilty of being a fourth time offender.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b812-7\">Two prior Massachusetts offenses, which occurred on May 14, 1992, and October 1, 1994, are not at issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b812-8\">N.H.

Rev. Stat. Ann. \u00a7] 265:82 or 265:82-a until such person has furnished proof of successful completion of an impaired driver intervention program . . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b813-9\">Having so concluded, we need not reach the issue of whether the requirement that <em>the court assign </em>a defendant to a treatment program is met in New Hampshire, wherein the onus is upon the individual and the registry rather than the court. \u201cThe Director [of the registry of motor vehicles] shall not restore the license . . . until such person has furnished proof of successful completion of an impaired driver intervention program . . . .\u201d N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 263:65-a.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b813-10\">Practically speaking, even if we were to agree with the defendant, the result would be a reduction of the verdict to operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol, third offense, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hernandez, </em>60 Mass. App. Ct. 416, 418-419 (2004), and a remand for resentencing, which would likely be of little assistance to the defendant given the comments of the judge at sentencing. \u201c[Given the defendant\u2019s background,] I don\u2019t feel that the court has any option but to impose ... a sentence which is in excess of the mandatory minimum sentence here.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b813-11\">During recross-examination, Martin testified that the \u201cstaggering\u201d box was not checked because the defendant was seated during the entire booking process.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b815-8\">One further example appears during the defendant\u2019s direct examination, wherein he was asked, \u201cDid you read the Alcohol Influence Report?\u201d After he responded that he had, he was then asked, \u201cDidn\u2019t it indicate that you were cooperative?\u201d He answered in the affirmative.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b815-9\">\u201cRecords kept by hospitals . . . may be admitted by the court, <em>in its discretion, </em>as evidence in the courts of the commonwealth so far as such records relate to the treatment and medical history of such cases and the court may, <em>in its discretion, </em>admit copies of such records . . .\u201d (emphasis added).

L. c. 233, \u00a7 79.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b815-10\">In <em>Moran, </em>the sexual assault complainant testified that she had undergone a laparoscopy and been instructed to refrain from intercourse. The Supreme Judicial Court held that her medical records should have been admitted to impeach her testimony because they showed that she underwent a completely different procedure which did not involve instructions to refrain from intercourse. <em>Id. </em>at 488-489.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b816-6\">The judge indicated that \u201cIf a doctor was here, as a witness, he could testify as to his observations.\u201d The judge also would have allowed testimony concerning the practice and circumstances under which notations of intoxication would have been made in the records, thus establishing the predicate basis for their admission.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
