L. c. 210, \u00a7 3, terminating her parental rights as to the three youngest of her five children: Ramona, bom on September 28, 1988, Curt, bom on June 22, 1990, and Sam, born on April 18, 1991. At all relevant times since removal from her mother\u2019s care in early 1999, Ramona has been in the same preadoptive foster care setting, where she has flourished, and she wishes to be adopted by her foster mother. Accordingly, Ramona expresses reservation about her decree only insofar as it precludes posttermination and postadoption visitation between and among the siblings. Curt and Sam, neither of whom are in preadoptive homes nor wish to be adopted, join their mother in appealing their decrees, claiming in effect that it renders them legal orphans.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-5\">1. <em>Background. </em>The Department of Social Services (department) brought a care and protection proceeding pursuant to G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 24, in May, 1998, as to all five children,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> who then ranged in age from seven to fifteen years old. The proceeding was brought following a number of G. L. 119, \u00a7 51A, reports clustered in a period of several months, showing the three youngest children running very seriously amok,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and their mother repeatedly neglecting them by leaving them either unsupervised, or inadequately supervised, by a boyfriend or one or both of the oldest two children. The five children were placed in the department\u2019s custody, but remained in their mother\u2019s care for almost a year until she was briefly incarcerated in early 1999.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> They were then placed in various foster care settings and, in essence, have not been in their mother\u2019s care since that time.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b296-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>In February of 2000, the mother stipulated that all of her children were in need of care and protection<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>; the permanency plan for the three youngest was changed to adoption later that year.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Trial took place over three days during the first three months of 2002, the decrees entered on June 26, 2002, and the judge\u2019s findings on October 4, 2002. The mother, Curt, and Sam jointly moved on November 20, 2002, for relief from judgment seeking (a) that the decrees dispensing with parental consent as to Curt and Sam be vacated on the grounds that, given their ages, they cannot be adopted without their consent, which consent they refuse to give; and (b) in the alternative, that new decrees enter adding provisions that the boys have posttermination and postadoption visits with the mother. The boys also moved for posttermination and postadoption sibling visitation. Their motions were supported by the boys\u2019 affidavits. After hearing, the judge without opinion denied the first two motions, but allowed the motion seeking sibling visitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-5\">On appeal, the mother contends that, as to all three children, the judge\u2019s findings of fact were based upon stale evidence and were insufficiently detailed to support the ultimate finding that she was, at the time of trial, unfit to parent each of the three children. The boys support this position as it concerns their mother\u2019s fitness to parent them and further contend, with the mother, that the evidence did not support the ultimate finding that it was in their best interests that the mother\u2019s parental rights be terminated. Finally, the mother and the boys maintain that the judge erred in failing to provide for posttermination and postadoption visitation between and among the mother and the boys.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-6\">2. <em>Unfitness to parent. </em>Faced with a petition to dispense with parental consent to adoption, a judge must first determine whether the parent is currently unfit to further the welfare and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>best interests of the children. <em>Adoption of Willow, </em>433 Mass. 636, 644 (2001). See <em>Adoption of Gregory, </em>434 Mass. 117, 125 (2001). A determination of parental unfitness must be child-specific; \u201cthe issue is the current fitness of the biological parents to further the welfare and the best interests of the <em>particular </em>child\u201d (emphasis original). <em>Custody of a Minor, </em>21 Mass. App. Ct. 1, 7 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b297-5\">In addition to Ramona\u2019s participation in certain of the 1998 behaviors occasioned by the mother\u2019s neglect as earlier detailed,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and Ramona\u2019s report of inadequate food, hygiene, and sleep while in the mother\u2019s care,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> the judge found that, during an April, 2000, visit with the mother, Ramona became frightened by her mother\u2019s efforts to retrieve a car from Beth\u2019s father. Since her removal from her mother\u2019s care, Ramona\u2019s behavior in school had improved, and she had become involved in sports. Ramona\u2019s therapist opined that Ramona\u2019s behavior would regress were she to be returned to her mother\u2019s care. The judge also found that Ramona was happy in the foster home that she had lived in since she was removed from her mother\u2019s care and that Ramona did not wish to return to live with her mother. Ramona had expressed a preference to remain permanently in her foster home and to be adopted by her foster mother, who wishes to adopt her. These findings are sufficiently specific and detailed to allow us to ascertain which facts the judge considered and relied upon in determining that the mother was currently unfit to parent Ramona and that termination of the mother\u2019s parental rights was in Ramona\u2019s best interests. See <em>Custody of Eleanor, </em>414 Mass. 795, 799 (1993); <em>Adoption of Willow, </em>433 Mass, at 644-645.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-6\">The judge\u2019s findings with regard to the mother\u2019s current fitness to parent Curt and Sam, however, are considerably more sparse. The judge found that Curt\u2019s behavior regressed when the mother missed visits with him. The judge found that, during one visit between and among the mother, Beth, Curt, Ramona, and Sam, Sam kept to himself. These findings, even when viewed in conjunction with the 1998 behaviors occasioned by maternal neglect, fall short of what is necessary to sustain a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>determination of current parental unfitness. We note that certain other findings relate additional facts, which might properly weigh in favor of a determination of unfitness, but those findings do not identify the child or children to whom the judge refers.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The findings as to Curt and Sam, then, are lacking in both detail and specificity, and neither demonstrate that the requisite close attention was given to the evidence nor show that the judge\u2019s determination of maternal unfitness was based upon consideration of all the relevant facts. See <em>Custody of Eleanor, </em>414 Mass. at 799.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-4\">In addition to being child-specific, a determination of unfitness must be based on current evidence. While a judge may rely upon a parent\u2019s prior pattern of behavior in determining parental unfitness, the judge is required to assess whether a parent is currently unfit. <em>Adoption of Paula, </em>420 Mass. 716, 730 (1995). See <em>Adoption of Carlos, </em>413 Mass. 339, 348 (1992). This inquiry requires the judge to focus on the present. <em>Adoption of Paula, supra </em>at 731 (\u2018\u2018A judge whose order will have the effect of irreversibly terminating the legal parent-child relationship must focus on the present circumstances of the parent and the child, taking into account recent positive gains, [if any] . . .\u201d). Here, the bulk of the judge\u2019s findings as to the mother\u2019s unfitness to parent Curt and Sam rested upon events occurring more than two years prior to trial, even though recent evidence of the mother\u2019s parenting was available. For example, the mother had successful, unsupervised, overnight visitation with Beth prior to trial; by the time of trial, Beth was visiting with the mother almost daily; the department recommended reunification of Beth and her mother, and filed a motion to dismiss Beth from the petition, which was allowed. Recent evidence of the mother\u2019s participation in a parenting program, a nurturing program, and an anger-management program was also available.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> It does not appear that such evidence was considered.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-5\">The lack of specific and current findings regarding the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>mother\u2019s fitness to parent Curt or Sam is of particular concern because neither boy had a continuous placement, nor formed bonds with caretakers other than the mother since the time that he was removed from the mother\u2019s care. <em>See. Adoption of Flora, </em>60 Mass. App. Ct. 334, 341 (2004). Even if we were to assume, despite the aforesaid misgivings, that the mother\u2019s current unfitness to parent each boy had been established by clear and convincing evidence, the question remains whether termination of her parental rights would serve each boy\u2019s best interests. See <em>Adoption of Nancy, ante 252, </em>257-258 (2004). In these circumstances, where their mother is the one person with whom they have an enduring parent-child relationship and each boy has voiced his opposition to being adopted, there is reason to think that terminating the mother\u2019s rights as to either boy might render them legal orphans. See <em>Adoption of Carlos, </em>413 Mass, at 351. It is precisely because of the gravity and finality inherent in the termination of parental rights that we require trial judges who contemplate this \u201cextreme step\u201d to make specific and detailed findings that would warrant it. <em>Adoption of Gregory, </em>434 Mass. at 126, quoting from <em>Adoption of Frederick, </em>405 Mass. 1, 5 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b299-5\">3. <em>Best interests of the children. A </em>determination of parental unfitness is the first of two \u201ccognate and connected\u201d steps in the process of determining whether termination of parental rights should occur. <em>Petition of the New England Home for Little Wanderers to Dispense with Consent to Adoption, </em>367 Mass. 631, 641 (1975). After ascertaining unfitness, the judge must determine whether the parent\u2019s unfitness is such that it would be in the child\u2019s best interests to end all legal relations between parent and child. See <em>Petition of the Dept. of Social Servs. to Dispense with Consent to Adoption, </em>391 Mass. 113, 119 (1984); <em>Adoption of Carlos, </em>413 Mass. at 350-351. \u201c[E]yen if a parent is found to be unfit, there are some situations in which the child\u2019s best interest may be served without a decree of termination.\u201d <em>Adoption of Flora, </em>60 Mass. App. Ct. at 342.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>Ramona lived with her mother during a time when all five children were at home and when the mother\u2019s parenting skills were not at their strongest.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Moreover, Ramona bonded with her foster mother and did not maintain a bond with her mother. In view of Ramona\u2019s long placement and connection with her foster mother, her improvement in school and participation in sports, as well as the plan for her adoption, we are persuaded by Ramona\u2019s argument that the findings, taken as a whole, support the judge\u2019s conclusion that the evidence warranted termination of the mother\u2019s parental rights as to Ramona. The decree terminating the parental rights of the mother with respect to Ramona is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-5\">The situation with Curt and Sam is quite different. At the time of trial, Curt and Sam were each almost of an age to prevent his own adoption, see G. L. c. 210, \u00a7 2,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> and each expressed his determination not to be adopted. Each boy remained connected with his biological mother and neither had formed close bonds with other caretakers. The judge did not make findings regarding Curt\u2019s custodial preferences, and although the judge found that Sam wished to be adopted, this finding was not supported by the evidence and was clearly erroneous. See <em>Adoption of Gregory, </em>434 Mass. at 126. The severing of parental rights must not take place \u201cunless the child\u2019s present or future welfare demands it.\u201d <em>Adoption of Carlos, </em>413 Mass. at 350. Absent here are findings that explain why it is in the best interests of Curt and of Sam to terminate their mother\u2019s parental rights, given that each boy is unlikely to be adopted and remains bonded with his mother. See <em>Adoption of Nancy, supra </em>at 258.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-6\">The decrees terminating the parental rights of the mother with respect to Curt and Sam are accordingly vacated, and the matter is remanded to the Juvenile Court for such further proceedings as are necessary and appropriate to determine forthwith the issue of parental fitness as to each boy and to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>make requisite findings in connection therewith, all in a manner not inconsistent with this opinion. If the mother is found currently unfit to parent either or both boys, the judge shall determine and make requisite findings whether it is in such child\u2019s best interests to have the mother\u2019s parental rights terminated. Because Curt and Sam are old enough to have a final say as to their own adoptions, the wishes of each child as to termination should be considered in determining their best interests. See <em>Adoption of Flora, </em>60 Mass. App. Ct. at 342. See also <em>Custody of a Minor, </em>383 Mass. 595, 602 (1981).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Pending the further proceedings, custody is to remain with the department.
