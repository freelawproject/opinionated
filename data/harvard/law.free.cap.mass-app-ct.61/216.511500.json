We hold that, in the circumstances of this case, it may.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-15\">The husband appeals from (1) the denial of his motion for clarification of that part of the judgment of divorce nisi dividing his public pension; and (2) the allowance of the former wife\u2019s motion for entry of a qualified domestic relations order. More specifically, the husband argues the judge erred in approving a domestic relations order that followed a sample order issued by the Massachusetts Teachers\u2019 Retirement Board whereby the wife, as alternate payee, is to receive a percentage of his public pension upon his retirement based upon a calculation using his future compensation and years of continued public employment accrued <em>after </em>the date of the divorce judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number><em>Background. </em>The parties were married on July 8, 1973, and, after twenty-six years of marriage, the plaintiff, Sharon O. Brower, divorced her husband, Frank C. Brower. The judgment of divorce nisi entered on July 8, 1999. At the time of trial, the husband was fifty years old and had been employed as a public school teacher for over twenty-two years.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> His Massachusetts teacher\u2019s retirement pension was the principal marital asset. In dividing the pension benefits, the judge ordered that \u201c[t]he Wife shall receive an irrevocable survivor beneficiary interest in and to 37.5% of the Husband\u2019s Massachusetts Teacher\u2019s Retirement benefit which had accrued as of July 8, 1999, commencing at the time of the Husband\u2019s retirement.\u201d Neither party appealed from the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-5\">In May, 2000, the wife, pursuant to the judgment, submitted a qualified domestic relations order to the court.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The husband thereafter filed a motion for clarification with regard to the division of his pension benefits. His motion was denied and the court approved the domestic relations order. On appeal, he argues that the order is in contravention of a 1990 amendment to G. L. c. 208, \u00a7 34, which, he argues, limited the marital estate to assets \u201caccrued during the marriage.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> He claims error in that the order calls for the use of the average of his three <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>highest consecutive yearly salaries as of his actual retirement date, rather than as of the date of divorce, in determining the marital portion of the benefit. This, he claims, includes in the marital estate retirement benefits that will accrue after the marriage ended.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-5\"><em>Discussion. </em>We are guided by <em>Moriarty </em>v. <em>Stone, </em>41 Mass. App. Ct. 151 (1996), where a similar argument was made concerning assets accrued prior to the marriage. \u201cIt is apparently the husband\u2019s position that the 1990 amendment evinces an intent on the part of the Legislature to exclude retirement-related benefits accrued prior to the marriage from the estate to be divided under \u00a7 34.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 156 n.4. We disagreed and held that the statutory phrase \u201caccrued during the marriage\u201d did not prohibit a judge from including within the assignable estate that part of a spouse\u2019s pension or retirement benefits that accrued <em>prior </em>to the marriage.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We see no reason why that analysis cannot be applied to the similar postmarriage assets at issue here.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>Baccanti </em>v. <em>Morton, </em>434 Mass. 787 (2001), buttresses our view. There the court addressed the related issue of the division of stock options. \u201cThe trial judge has discretion under G. L. c. 208, \u00a7 34, to decide whether an asset should be included in the marital estate based on the parties\u2019 joint efforts in acquiring that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>asset and should not necessarily be confined by the period of the marriage.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 799.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-4\">Here, the judge was faced with a difficult determination. The actual value of the pension (which, as we have said, was the primary marital asset) depended on a number of variables that could not be determined in advance. The husband could retire in a day, a year, or a decade. He might remarry or die before reaching retirement. Given the present financial circumstances of the parties, a buy-out, while preferable, was not practical. See <em>Early </em>v. <em>Early, </em>413 Mass. 720, 726 (1992). Left with deciding whether, for purposes of asset distribution, the retirement benefit should be calculated at the time of the dissolution of the marriage<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> or at the time of retirement,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> the judge\u2019s findings of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>fact indicate that he chose the latter.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> We cannot say this was improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-5\">\u201c[I]n consideration of the one spouse [for]going the present enjoyment of the benefits, he or she will share in any increase in benefits that continued employment will produce, including increase in pension benefits and salary.\u201d <em>In re Marriage of Hunt, </em>909 P.2d 525, 537 (Colo. 1995), quoting from <em>Koelsch </em>v. <em>Koelsch, </em>148 Ariz. 176, 179 (1986), quoting from <em>Koelsch </em>v. <em>Koelsch, </em>148 Ariz. 187, 191 (Ct.

In this case, it appears from the judge\u2019s findings (see note 9, <em>supra) </em>and the domestic relations order (see note 2, <em>supra) </em>that he exercised his discretion and attempted to devise a fair resolution to a difficult issue by calculating the full value of the husband\u2019s pension as of his actual retirement date, but assigning to the wife 37.5 percent of an amount representing only the number of years of covered employment up through the date of the divorce.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark>,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> An equally <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>wise judge in another case might appropriately decide that the total pension benefit should be frozen as of the date of the divorce, as opposed to using the husband\u2019s highest consecutive three-year average salary at his actual retirement date.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The discretion of the judge will be upheld \u201cunless it is \u2018plainly wrong and excessive.\u2019 \u201d <em>Dalessio </em>v. <em>Dalessio, </em>409 Mass, at 830, quoting from <em>Redding </em>v. <em>Redding, </em>398 Mass, at 107.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark>,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b256-4\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b251-6\">(A pension valuation in the record states that \u201cit appears\u201d that the husband\u2019s employment in the public school system began \u201con or about 10/14/1971,\u201d but that he \u201cappears to have left or taken a leave of absence, since he was reinstated effective 9/1/1976.\u201d The trial judge found that the husband had been employed as a public school teacher for between twenty-two and twenty-seven years.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b251-7\">The order, as adopted by the trial judge, provided in paragraph 5:</p>\n<p id=\"b251-8\">\u201cThe Alternate Payee\u2019s Benefit shall be equal to thirty-seven and one-half percent (37.5%) of the marital portion of the Participant\u2019s benefit commencing at the time of the Participant\u2019s actual retirement.

Typically, there is commingling of effort undertaken during the marriage and after the marriage which together enhance the value of the future benefit. The employee spouse\u2019s ability to enhance the future benefit after the marriage frequently builds on foundation work and efforts undertaken during the marriage. Hence, the theory underlying the \u2018time rule\u2019 formula is called the \u2018marital foundation\u2019 theory.\u201d <em>Hunt, </em>909 P.2d at 534.

App. Ct. 97 (1983), for calculating the marital benefit when division occurs at retirement:</p>\n<p id=\"b254-16\">\u201c \u2018[T]he award is typically a percentage ... of that portion of the pension benefits attributable to the period of the marriage. The portion attributable to the period of the marriage is generally determined by multiplying the net pension benefit by a fraction [often called the \u201ccoverture fraction\u201d], the numerator of which is the time period during which retirement benefits were accrued during the marriage and the denominator of which is the total period of accrual.\u2019 <em>[Dewan, supra] </em>at 101.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-17\">\u201cThe actuarial formula used in paragraph 5 of the Domestic Relations Order executed by the Court in this instance reflects this model <em>by allowing the full benefit to accumulate until, and be calculated as of, the date of the Husband\u2019s retirement, </em>at which point this sum is apportioned relative to the date of divorce\u201d (emphasis added).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b255-10\">For example, \u201c[pjension plans come in many complex varieties and forms, including vested or unvested pensions, matured or unmatured pensions, defined benefit or defined contribution pensions, contributory or noncontributory pensions, etc.\u201d <em>Hunt, </em>909 P.2d at 529-530.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b255-11\">Under G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 5, which governs the husband\u2019s pension, his annual retirement allowance is determined by multiplying three variables: (1) years of creditable service; (2) a percent (which increases with age, from a low of 1.5 percent at age fifty-five to a high of 2.5 percent at age sixty-five); and (3) the highest consecutive three-year average salary earned. In determining the wife\u2019s share, the judge altered the first factor by substituting for the total years of creditable service the number of years of service through the date of divorce; he left the other two elements unchanged. The husband argues that the wife\u2019s share should be further limited by factoring into the third element only his earnings as of the date of divorce.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b255-12\">While the judge purported to follow <em>Dewan, </em>17 Mass. App. Ct. at 101, see note 9, <em>supra, </em>his methodology deviated in one respect from the <em>Dewan </em>formulation and the \u201ctime rule\u201d formula (see note 8, <em>supra): </em>typically, the nonemployee spouse is credited only with the number of years of marriage during which the employee spouse was employed. Here, the judge did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>limit the number of years of employment in the first element of the formula (see note 11, <em>supra) </em>to the couple\u2019s twenty-six years of marriage. (See note 2, <em>supra, </em>assigning the husband\u2019s \u201ccredited service under the Retirement Plan through July 8, 1999,\u201d to the first element of the three-part formula.) Thus, nearly two years of the husband\u2019s employment prior to the marriage (October 14, 1971, to July 8, 1973, but see note 1, <em>supra), </em>was not excluded by the judge. In this case, the number of years of employment prior to the marriage is relatively small compared to the total number of years of marriage. In other cases, the number of years employed prior to the marriage could be more significant. The husband here does not appeal from that aspect of the order, and we address it no further.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b256-6\">See, e.g., <em>Daugherty </em>v. <em>Daugherty, </em>50 Mass. App. Ct. at 740-741, wherein the parties disagreed as to the date a profit sharing fund should have been valued \u2014 the date of the separation, divorce, or property division trial. The court quoted <em>Davidson </em>v. <em>Davidson, </em>19 Mass. App. Ct. 364, 370 n.9 (1985), stating that \u201c[w]e intend no suggestion of a rule fixing any of [the dates when marital property is identified], or excluding some earlier time in appropriate circumstances, e.g., the date of the separation of the parties, as determinative in identifying divisible property. We think the development of the law in this respect is best left to a case-by-case analysis.\u201d <em>Daugherty </em>v. <em>Daugherty, supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b256-7\">We thus are not adhering solely to the use of one formula over another.
