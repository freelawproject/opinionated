A Superior Court judge allowed Commercial\u2019s summary judgment motion on the ground that because Beals could have and should have amended her complaint for arbitration to include her present allegations of Commercial\u2019s bad faith refusal to settle her underinsurance claim, she was barred from bringing the present action. Because we conclude that Beals was not required to submit her allegations of Commercial\u2019s bad faith to the arbitrator deciding her underinsurance claim, we reverse the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-4\">1. <em>Background. </em>We set out the chronology of events giving rise to the controversy. On May 19, 1988, Beals was hurt in an automobile accident. Both she and the driver of the car in which she was a passenger were insured by Commercial. Three years later, after submitting records of her medical treatment and substantial expenses to Commercial, undergoing a physical examination by Commercial\u2019s doctor, and incurring legal expenses, Beals brought suit against the driver of the vehicle in which she was a passenger. In October, 1992, a \u201cmock\u201d jury trial was held in Superior Court on this action. The jury returned a nonbinding award of $150,000 in favor of Beals. Five months later, in March of 1993, Commercial sent Beals a check in the amount of the limit of the driver\u2019s policy, $100,000. Beals accepted the check in settlement of her claim against the driver. In doing so, she reserved her right to make a claim against Commercial for underinsurance benefits under her own policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-5\">Thereafter, on April 28, 1993, and April 29, 1994, Beals underwent two surgical procedures and incurred additional medical expenses. Her treating physician was of the opinion that these procedures were related to the 1988 accident. In May, 1994, Beals brought a complaint against Commercial pursuant to G. L. c. 175, \u00a7 111D, requesting arbitration on her claim for underinsurance benefits.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b224-6\">On August 25, 1995, after numerous settlement discussions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>and a physical examination of Beals by Commercial\u2019s physician, who could not \u201ccausally relate\u201d her injuries, Commercial offered to settle Beals\u2019s underinsurance claim for $15,000, an amount that would leave her $35,000 short in light of the jury\u2019s 1992 nonbinding verdict that she was entitled to $150,000 in damages as a result of the 1988 accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-5\">Although Beals rejected this offer of $15,000, she sought to continue negotiations with Commercial. Commercial, however, refused to do so and stated that it would not meet with her unless she agreed to mediate her claim at the equal expense of both. Beals declined to participate in mediation on the stated basis of the cost involved when considered in the light of her current living expenses as well as the expenses that she had incurred in recovering against the driver.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-6\">Trial before the arbitrator began on February 6, 1997. Two months later, on April 7, 1997, the arbitrator awarded Beals $204,000 on account of the 1988 accident, to be offset by the amount that she had previously received from Commercial on its policy with the driver. Nine days later, Commercial forwarded a check to Beals in the amount of $100,000, the limit of her underinsurance policy. The check and the letter accompanying it stated that it was a full and final payment of all of Beals\u2019s claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-7\">On April 24, 1997, Beals wrote to Commercial requesting that she be allowed to cash the check while reserving her rights to seek interest on the award, of about $35,000, and to pursue claims for damages on the basis of Commercial\u2019s alleged refusal to make a prompt and reasonable offer of settlement on her underinsurance claim as required by G. L. c. 93A and G. L. c. 176D. It appears from this letter that these issues had been the topic of numerous telephone conversations between the parties\u2019 attorneys. In this letter, Beals also offered to settle all claims against Commercial for $135,000, that is, the amount awarded by the arbitrator with interest on that award. Beals also advised Commercial in this letter that should Commercial refuse to accept her offer, then she and Commercial should proceed on her motion to confirm the arbitrator\u2019s award. There is nothing in the record before us to indicate Commercial\u2019s response, if any, to the letter. We infer from the fact that the arbitrator\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>award was confirmed by a Superior Court judge on December 15, 1997, that Commercial refused to respond to the letter or to make an acceptable offer of settlement. In confirming the arbitrator\u2019s award, the judge also ordered that Commercial pay interest in the amount of $35,806, that is, interest on the arbitrator\u2019s award computed from the date Beals filed her complaint for arbitration on May 18, 1994. Commercial appealed the judgment,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and on June 15, 1999, in an unpublished decision we struck the provision for preaward interest but otherwise affirmed the judge\u2019s confirmation of the arbitrator\u2019s award. See <em>Beals </em>v. <em>Commercial Union Ins. Co., </em>47 Mass. App. Ct. 1104 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b226-5\">In the meantime, however, on June 8, 1999, that is, a week prior to our decision on Commercial\u2019s appeal, Beals\u2019s attorney wrote a \u201cformal demand letter\u201d to Commercial pursuant to G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 9(3). In this six-page letter, Beals chronicled the history of her settlement attempts on her underinsurance claim, described those acts by Commercial that she alleged to be in violation of G. L. c. 93A and G. L. c. 176D, \u00a7 <em>3(9)(f), (g), </em>and made an offer of settlement in the amount of $90,000, that is, $85,000 in compensatory damages and $5,000 in attorney\u2019s fees. Beals advised Commercial that her claims were based upon the facts that Commercial had failed to make a prompt and fair settlement after its liability had become reasonably clear and, instead, had forced her to litigate her underinsurance claim by offering her $15,000, an amount substantially less than the amount of damages determined first by an advisory jury and then by an arbitrator.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-6\">By letter dated July 8, 1999, that is, about three weeks after the date of our decision in <em>Beals </em>v. <em>Commercial Union Ins. Co., supra, </em>and exactly thirty days after Beals\u2019s demand letter, Commercial rejected Beals\u2019s demand for settlement. In this letter, Commercial detailed its reasons for its refusal to settle, including the assertion that Beals\u2019s letter did not sufficiently \u201ccomply <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>with the requirements\u201d of a demand letter making a claim for relief under G. L. c. 93A, and contended that Commercial\u2019s actions were based upon its right to question its liability and the amount of damages sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-4\">Beals then brought the complaint now before us on August 24, 1999, alleging breach of contract (her insurance policy), breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, and unfair claim and settlement practices in violation of G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 9, and G. L. c. 176D, \u00a7 3(9)(f), (g)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We refer collectively to her claims as \u201cbad faith claims.\u201d Commercial answered the complaint and, about seven months later, sought summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-5\">On these facts, the judge concluded that because Beals knew of the claims asserted in her present complaint as of August, 1995, she could have and should have amended her 1994 complaint for arbitration to include them prior to the entry of judgment on that earlier complaint. As support for her ruling, the judge cited to the discussion of claim preclusion set out in <em>Heacock </em>v. <em>Heacock, </em>402 Mass. 21, 23-24 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b227-6\">2. <em>Discussion. </em>Claim preclusion, often considered \u201ctrue\u201d res judicata, is not to be confused with issue preclusion, also known as collateral estoppel. See <em>Salem </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Commn. Against Discrimination, </em>44 Mass. App. Ct. 627, 637 (1998); <em>Green </em>v. <em>Brookline, </em>53 Mass. App. Ct. 120, 123 n.5 (2001). As explained in <em>Heacock </em>v. <em>Heacock, </em>402 Mass, at 23, the \u201cdoctrine of claim preclusion makes a valid, final judgment conclusive on the parties . . . and bars further litigation of all matters that were or should have been adjudicated in the action.\u201d The doctrine of claim preclusion is applicable to arbitration proceedings. See <em>Blanchette </em>v. <em>School Comm. of Westwood, </em>427 Mass. 176, 179-181 (1998). Not only are claims resolved in litigation or arbitration precluded from subsequent litigation, so too are those which could or should have been presented in the first proceeding. See <em>id. </em>at 179 n.3, and cases therein cited; <em>O\u2019Neill </em>v. <em>City Manager of Cambridge, </em>428 Mass. 257, 259 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>(1998). Both Beals and Commercial correctly make their arguments in terms of \u201cclaim preclusion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b228-5\">As the party moving for summary judgment, Commercial had the burden of establishing the three elements of claim preclusion as set out in <em>DaLuz </em>v. <em>Department of Correction, </em>434 Mass. 40, 44-45 (2001):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-6\">\u201c \u2018 \u201cWhen arbitration affords opportunity for presentation of evidence and argument substantially similar in form and scope to judicial proceedings, the award should have the same effect on issues necessarily determined as a judgment has.\u201d <em>Bailey </em>v. <em>Metropolitan Property &amp; Liab. Ins. Co., </em>24 Mass. App. Ct. 34, 36-37 (1987), quoting Restatement (Second) of Judgments \u00a7 84 comment c (1982).\u2019 <em>Miles </em>v. <em>Aetna Cas. &amp; Sur. Co., </em>412 Mass. 424, 427 (1992). Three elements are essential for invocation of claim preclusion: (1) the identity or privity of the parties to the present and prior actions, (2) identity of the cause of action, and (3) prior final judgment on the merits. <em>Franklin </em>v. <em>North Weymouth Coop. Bank, </em>283 Mass. 275, 280 (1933).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b228-7\">For purposes of decision, we assume without deciding that the judge was correct in ruling that Beals indisputably knew of the facts asserted in the action now before us as of August, 1995, and, therefore, could have moved to amend her 1994 complaint for arbitration to include claims based on those facts. Proceeding on that assumption, we focus on the question whether Beals is precluded from proceeding on her present complaint because of her failure to amend her original complaint (for arbitration) to put her bad faith claims before the Superior Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-8\">Although G. L. c. 175, \u00a7 111D, required Beals to submit her original underinsurance claim to an arbitrator, see note 2, <em>supra, </em>that statutory mandate is narrow in scope and inapplicable to Beals\u2019s bad faith claims. See <em>Aetna Cas. &amp; Sur. Co. </em>v. <em>Poirier, </em>371 Mass. 257, 259-260 (1976). Commercial does not argue otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-9\">Instead, Commercial contends that because Beals\u2019s bad faith claims arose out of the substantially same transaction as that put before the arbitrator under \u00a7 111D, her failure to amend her 1994 complaint to include those claims precludes her from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>subsequently raising them. See <em>Porn </em>v. <em>National Grange Mut. Ins. Co., 93 </em>F.3d 31, <em>37 </em>(1st Cir. 1996) (applying \u201ctransactional\u201d approach set out in Restatement [Second] of Judgments \u00a7 24 [1982], for purposes of defining cause of action consistent with Federal res judicata principles). See also <em>Saint Louis </em>v. <em>Baystate Med. Center, Inc., </em>30 Mass. App. Ct. 393, 399 (1991) (\u201cA claim is the same for res judicata purposes if it is derived from the same transaction or series of connected transactions\u201d); <em>TLT Constr. Corp. </em>v. <em>A. Anthony Tappe &amp; Assocs., </em>48 Mass. App. Ct. 1, 8 (1999) (claims essentially same notwithstanding difference in \u201cnomenclature\u201d given in prior arbitration and current litigation).</p>\n<p id=\"b229-5\">To accept Commercial\u2019s argument would be to hold that a consumer could be forced to arbitrate a c. 93A claim arising out of a transaction subject to arbitration. But see <em>Hannon </em>v. <em>Original Gunite Aquatech Pools, Inc., </em>385 Mass. 813, 826 (1982) (consumer need not submit c. 93A claim to arbitration as precondition to assertion of rights under that statute). There is nothing in the <em>Porn, Saint Louis, </em>or <em>TLT Constr. Corp. </em>opinions that contradicts <em>Hannon </em>or otherwise holds that a person can be forced to arbitrate a claim brought under G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-6\">That is not to say that Beals could not have agreed to submit her bad faith claims to the arbitrator. In <em>TLT Constr. Corp., supra </em>at 13, we concluded that because there was nothing in the record to show either that the parties were bound by contract or had intended to include c. 93A claims in the mandated arbitration proceedings arising out of disputes under the contract, the c. 93A claims were not barred by principles of res judicata. Contrast <em>Drywall Sys., Inc. </em>v. <em>ZVI Constr. Co., </em>435 Mass. 664, 666-667 (2002) (arbitration clause in contract sufficiently broad as to include claims under c. 93A); <em>Gargano &amp; Assocs., P.C. </em>v. <em>John Swider &amp; Assocs., </em>55 Mass. App. Ct. 256, 260-262 (2002) (election to submit G. L. c. 93A claim to arbitration precluded subsequent pursuit of that claim).</p>\n<p id=\"b229-7\">There is, however, nothing in the record before us that shows that Beals intended to arbitrate her bad faith claims along with her underinsurance claim or that her allegations of Commercial\u2019s bad faith settlement practices were heard and determined by the arbitrator. Moreover, precedent does not suggest that it is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>unusual for a plaintiff to file an action based upon allegations of bad faith violations separate and apart from a successfully arbitrated insurance claim. See, e.g., <em>Bonofiglio </em>v. <em>Commercial Union Ins. Co., </em>411 Mass. 31, 32-33 (1991); <em>Murphy </em>v. <em>National Union Fire Ins. Co., </em>438 Mass. 529, 530-531 &amp; n.5 (2003). Cf. <em>Clegg </em>v. <em>Butler, </em>424 Mass. 413, 416 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b230-4\">On the record before us and for the reasons set out in <em>Hannon </em>v. <em>Original Gunite Aquatech Pools, Inc., </em>385 Mass, at 826, as discussed and applied in <em>Simas </em>v. <em>House of Cabinets, Inc., </em>53 Mass. App. Ct. 131, 137-138 &amp; n.8 (2001), and <em>Gargano &amp; Assocs., P.C. </em>v. <em>John Swider &amp; Assocs., </em>55 Mass. App. Ct. at 260-262, we conclude that Beals did not have to include her bad faith claims in her complaint for the arbitration mandated by G. L. c. 175, \u00a7 111D. Her decision not to do so does not preclude her from pursuing those allegations on her present complaint. Consequently, Commercial was not entitled to summary judgment on the basis of principles of res judicata.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-5\">\n<em>Judgment reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b224-7\">General Laws c. 175, \u00a7 111D, provides, in part, that when an insured and her motor vehicle liability insurer cannot agree as to the amount of damages due the insured through uninsured motorist coverage, the matter \u201cshall\u201d be determined \u201cby arbitration.\u201d By virtue of G.
