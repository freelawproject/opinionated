L. c. 119, \u00a7 26, finding the mother unfit and awarding permanent custody of the child to the biological father, who had been accused of domestic violence. The mother and child contend that there is not clear and convincing evidence of the mother\u2019s current unfitness. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>Further, they argue that public policy considerations support the application of <em>Custody of Vaughn, </em>422 Mass. 590 (1996), to care and protection cases and that the judge\u2019s failure to make specific and detailed findings on domestic violence by the father consistent with <em>Vaughn </em>constitutes reversible error. See <em>id. </em>at 599-600. Finally, they contend that the judge erred in granting permanent custody to the father under G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 26. We affirm the judge\u2019s ultimate finding as to the mother\u2019s current unfitness, but remand the case for express and detailed findings regarding domestic violence and its effect on the child and the father\u2019s fitness to parent. We also conclude that, in this care and protection proceeding in which the mother has been determined to be unfit, custody belongs to the biological father if he is not unfit, a question that remains to be resolved on remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-5\">1. <em>The Department of Social Services\u2019 involvement with the family. </em>The mother and father met in 1991. They lived together for a few years, without marrying, before the child was born on March 13, 1994. Following the parents\u2019 separation in February, 1996, the child lived with the mother.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-6\">After a G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 51A, report was filed and supported in October, 2000, and the mother was evicted from her home in December, the Department of Social Services (department) filed a care and protection petition on December 20, 2000, pursuant to G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 24. Temporary custody of the child was granted to her paternal aunt at the initial custody hearing. The judge then returned custody to the mother on March 26, 2001, with the conditions that she remain drug free, submit urine screens to the department, and complete a psychopharmacological evaluation and a neurological exam.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-7\">Another G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 51A, report was filed on May 18, 2001, when the child told school officials that there had been a fight in the apartment where the mother and child resided with two other adults and two other children. That report was supported. In June, the mother and child left that apartment and moved to New Hampshire, without notifying the department. As a consequence, the judge returned the child to the temporary custody of the department on July 11, 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-8\">The father located the mother and child in New Hampshire and returned with the child to Massachusetts, where he sur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>rendered her to the department. The child was placed with family members for a short time and then placed in a foster home by the department. Following a hearing in November, 2001, temporary custody remained with the department. On March 6, 2002, upon the father\u2019s request, he was adjudicated the child\u2019s father based upon the results of paternity testing. On June 21, 2002, the department placed the child with the father in Nashua, New Hampshire, where he lived with his fiancee and her teenage daughter.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The child has since resided with her father. A hearing on the merits concluded in September, 2002; judgment entered on December 19, 2002; and written findings were issued on July 21, 2003. Based on the record before this court, it does not appear that the mother has sought a review and redetermination hearing as to her parental fitness. The mother and child have, however, appealed the underlying judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-18\">2. <em>The mother\u2019s parental unfitness. </em>The Juvenile Court judge\u2019s findings of fact and conclusions of law, for which there is record support, establish the mother\u2019s unfitness clearly and convincingly. See <em>Custody of Eleanor, </em>414 Mass. 795, 799 (1993). \u201cParental unfitness must be determined by taking into consideration a parent\u2019s character, temperament, conduct, mental stability, home environment, and capacity to provide for the child in the same context with the child\u2019s particular needs, affections and age.\u201d <em>Adoption of Mary, </em>414 Mass. 705, 711 (1993). \u201c[W]e require that the judge\u2019s findings be specific and detailed, so as to demonstrate that close attention was given to the evidence.\u201d <em>Adoption of Georgia, </em>433 Mass. 62, 66 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b168-30\">The judge\u2019s findings here relate primarily to the mother\u2019s delusions of parasites, drug dependency, inability to comply with department service plans, and nomadic lifestyle, and to how the mother\u2019s behavior affected the child. The judge found that the mother \u201cexhibited symptoms of paranoia and delusional thinking; believing that her apartment, as well as herself, were infested with parasites.\u201d During the course of a visit by a department social worker, the mother collected \u201cspecimens\u201d that she <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>asserted were insects: these specimens were in fact a clump of chocolate drink mix, a \u201cmarble size nut,\u201d and a piece of tomato. The child also told the social worker that she would use tweezers to pull out the bugs from her mother\u2019s back. Neither the board of health nor an exterminator hired by the landlord found any evidence of infestation in the apartment.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b169-5\">A dermatologist diagnosed the mother with \u201cpickers nodules,\u201d a condition that occurs when an individual consistently picks at her skin, causing the skin to harden into nodes or nodules. Another dermatologist and the mother\u2019s primary care physician believed that the mother suffered from delusions of parasitosis.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-6\">The judge found that the \u201c[m]other would not send [the child] to school due to her belief that [the child] was infested with bugs despite medical evidence to the contrary.\u201d While in her mother\u2019s custody, the child \u201cmissed [thirty-nine] out of 175 days of kindergarten. She missed [eighteen] out of [the first twenty-eight] days of first grade and did not attend [school] at all from October 2, 2000, to . . . December 20, 2000.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The child was ultimately expelled due \u201cto excessive absenteeism.\u201d The judge concluded that the \u201c[m]other\u2019s mental health issues were the direct cause of [the child\u2019s] lack of attendance in school\u201d and that the mother was unable \u201cto understand the effect of excessive school absenteeism on her child.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b169-7\">The judge also found, with substantial support in the record, that the mother was addicted to Vicodin and abused Valium. As a condition of retaining custody of the child in March, 2001, the mother was required to remain drug free and to submit urine screens to the department for analysis. The mother failed to provide any drug screens to the department as requested, but provided one result to the court. The judge\u2019s findings further detailed the mother\u2019s general inability to comply with department service plans, especially those \u201cdeveloped to have [the] mother address her mental health issues and her neglect\u201d of the child.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>Finally, the judge focused on the mother\u2019s frequent moves with the child. While the child was in her mother\u2019s physical custody, from November, 2000, to July, 2001, the pair resided in at least four different locations: their home from which they were evicted; a motel; a friend\u2019s apartment, where they slept on the living room couch and floor; and finally a trailer park and campground in New Hampshire, where they moved without notifying the department.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The judge, while acknowledging that just prior to trial the mother had obtained appropriate housing, was not obliged to give undue weight to that evidence. See <em>Adoption of Lorna, </em>46 Mass. App. Ct. 134, 143 (1999); <em>Adoption of Inez, </em>428 Mass. 717, 723 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b170-5\">The evidence before the judge, reflected in the judge\u2019s ninety-one findings of fact and seventeen conclusions of law, establish the mother\u2019s parental unfitness clearly and convincingly.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b170-6\">3. <em>The father\u2019s parental fitness, </em>(a) <em>Findings and record evidence. </em>The judge found that the father was able \u201cto provide [the child] with a stable and nurturing environment in which to grow\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> once the child was placed with him; the father used the \u201cservices offered ... by the [department in an effective manner\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark>; and he was \u201cin compliance with all the tasks on his service plans with the [d]epartment.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The child \u201cattend[ed] public school on a regular basis\u201d when she began living with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>the father. The father was supportive of the mother\u2019s visitation rights.</p>\n<p id=\"AcG\">The judge also found that the father admitted to a history of substance abuse for which he had sought treatment. He \u201cremained sober for [four] years\u201d following treatment, relapsed when he was diagnosed with cancer, but \u201cis now sober.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AaS\">The judge\u2019s findings and conclusions on domestic violence are, however, ambiguous, essentially just summarizing conflicting testimony: \u201cFather testified that he did injure Mother in 1996 with his car. He was leaving for Florida in his car when Mother ran to the car and tore off the license plate, as he backed up and \u2018planted her in a snowbank.\u2019 Father stated that \u2018he was unaware that she was behind the car at the time.\u2019 Father turned himself into police when he found out they were looking for him. He pleaded guilty to assault and battery with a dangerous weapon and served 30 days in jail.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"ANr\">The judge recited the mother\u2019s testimony as well, which described a more violent February, 1996, incident. Although she recounted somewhat different and inconsistent versions of that incident at trial, the mother described the father smashing her head against a windshield and fracturing her skull prior to her leaving the car and the father backing into her.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The mother testified that the child witnessed this incident from her car seat and that the father threatened to kill the mother and the child. The mother also testified that she sought medical care after the incident.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The judge did not resolve the credibility dispute between the mother and father\u2019s different versions of the February, 1996, incident or address the father\u2019s guilty plea.</p>\n<p id=\"A_i\">In regard to other incidents of domestic violence, the mother and father acknowledged that their relationship was acrimonious. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>The father told a court clinician that \u201cat times \u2014 we were both hitting each other,\u201d but asserted that the abuse stopped when the child was born in 1994. The mother testified that they \u201cfought quite often\u201d and that the father would strike her \u201cquite often.\u201d She told a court clinician that the abuse continued after the child\u2019s birth. Included in the findings was the mother\u2019s statement that, \u201calthough [the] father has a history of abusing her, he never abused [the child] and [the] \u2018things he did never put [the child] at risk.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b172-12\">There was also evidence of other injuries to the mother that the judge did not address. A court clinician\u2019s report included excerpts from the mother\u2019s medical records. The clinician summarized the mother\u2019s primary care physician\u2019s records as follows: \u201cOn 7/5/95 [after the birth of the child], [the mother] presented with a Large hematoma and bruise around the left face. Black eye \u2014 bruising around left mandible. Bruise on both arms \u2014 two on left. Beaten by boyfriend on 7/3/95.\u201d Although they were living together at the time, the evidence does not specifically indicate whether the father was the boyfriend referenced in the physician\u2019s record.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-23\">The father responded to questions about his criminal history on direct and cross-examination. His criminal record, which was admitted in evidence, shows that, though he was charged with domestic assault and battery in September, 1995, that charge was later dismissed.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Since the 1995 and 1996 charges, the record reveals no evidence of domestic abuse on the part of the father; the judge, however, made no findings to that effect.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Likewise, the father\u2019s ex-wife, not the mother in this case, told a court investigator that the father was not physically abusive to her or her children. Similarly, the judge did not address that statement in her findings. There are no findings on the effects of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>domestic violence on the child. The record is slim to bare on the subject. We note that a court investigator\u2019s report dated July, 2002, states that the child\u2019s \u201cpersonality testing found indications of a child that \u2018was angry and depressed.\u2019 \u2018Anger, worry and depression\u2019 were common emotions as well as physical violence, physical injury and abandonment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b173-5\">(b) <em>Application of </em>Custody of Vaughn <em>to care and protection proceedings. </em>In <em>Custody of </em>Vaughn, 422 Mass, at 595, the court declared that \u201cphysical force within the family is both intolerable and too readily tolerated, and ... a child who has been either the victim or the spectator of such abuse suffers a distinctly grievous kind of harm.\u201d The court emphasized that the \u201cvery frequency of domestic violence in disputes about child custody may have the effect of inuring courts to it.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 599. The court, therefore, reversed a decision by a Probate Court judge to award custody to a \u201cfather who had committed acts of violence against the mother,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 596, because the judge had \u201cfailed to make detailed and comprehensive findings of fact on the issues of domestic violence and its effect upon the child as well as upon the father\u2019s parenting ability.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 599, quoting from <em>R.H. </em>v. <em>B.F., </em>39 Mass. App. Ct. 29, 40 (1995). Domestic violence, the court declared, \u201cis an issue too fundamental and frequently recurring to be dealt with only by implication.\u201d <em>Custody of Vaughn, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b173-6\">The parties are in agreement that the principle established in <em>Custody of Vaughn, supra, </em>that judges should make detailed and comprehensive findings on domestic violence when making custody determinations, applies in proceedings pursuant to G. L. c. 119 and G. L. c. 210.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Counsel for the child and mother also focused the Juvenile Court judge\u2019s attention on <em>Custody of Vaughn </em>during trial and in closing arguments. The department argues, however, that the judge did not err in this case because there was a lack of credible evidence of domestic violence to require such findings. We disagree. Here, the record raises sufficient concerns regarding domestic violence to require <em>Vaughn </em>findings. <em>Id. </em>at 599-600.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-7\">We recognize that the record on domestic violence is difficult <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>to evaluate because the incidents are dated and in part disputed: the acts of domestic violence occurred at least six years before the trial. The record contains no reported incidents of domestic violence on the part of the father since that time. Although he has had only limited contact with the mother, the father has had custody of the child since June, 2002.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-9\">The undisputed evidence, however, established that the father backed his car into the mother in February, 1996, and that he admitted to sufficient facts on charges of assault and battery with a dangerous weapon. He was found guilty of that offense and received a sentence of thirty days. This in and of itself warranted careful consideration of' the issue of domestic violence in relation to the custody decision.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> In addition, the mother contended that, in that same incident, the father smashed her head into the windshield in the presence of the child. In one version of these events, she also contended that the father <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>threatened to kill her and the child.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The judge summarized the different versions, but did not assess the credibility of the witnesses. See <em>Custody of Vaughn, </em>422 Mass, at 597-598 (stating \u201c[t]he judge did not, however, make any findings of fact based on [the expert\u2019s] testimony and did not say whether he considered [the expert\u2019s] testimony credible\u201d). See also <em>R.H. </em>v. <em>B.F., </em>39 Mass. App. Ct. at 40 (\u201c[a]lthough the trial judge recited much of the testimony of the mother, her older son, the daughter and the psychologist, he made no findings of fact on that testimony\u201d). If the mother\u2019s version were credited, a deliberate act of domestic violence, causing a serious injury, had taken place in front of the child, who was just shy of two years old. See generally <em>Custody of Vaughn, supra </em>at 599 (acknowledging reports of \u201cpsychological problems in children who witness domestic violence, especially during important developmental stages\u201d); <em>Adoption of Ramon, </em>41 Mass. App. Ct. 709, 714 (1996) (relying on <em>Custody of Vaughn </em>and addressing effects of domestic violence on a one and one-half year old child).</p>\n<p id=\"b175-5\">As noted above, the mother\u2019s medical records also reveal that she was badly \u201cbeaten by [her] boyfriend\u201d in July, 1995, when she was apparently involved with the father, a little more than a year after the child was bom. The judge did not address this issue in her findings. Also unresolved is the extent to which domestic violence occurred in front of the child, or if the child heard such violence. The father denied that any domestic violence occurred in the presence of the child. The judge\u2019s findings are that the mother testified that \u201calthough [the] father had a history of abusing her [including after the birth of the child], he never abused [the child] and [the] \u2018things he did never put [the child] at risk.\u2019 \u201d <em>Vaughn </em>cautions, however, that witnessing domestic violence is itself a \u201cgrievous\u201d harm. <em>Id. </em>at 595. See generally Cahn, Civil Images of Battered Women: The Impact of Domestic Violence on Custody Decisions, 44 Vand. L. Rev. 1041, 1055 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b175-6\">The judge was within her authority to credit the father\u2019s or the mother\u2019s versions of events, in whole or part, over the other. See <em>Custody of Two Minors, </em>396 Mass. 610, 618 (1986) (\u201cthe <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>judge\u2019s assessment of the weight of the evidence and the credibility of the witnesses is entitled to deference\u201d). None of the judge\u2019s findings of fact or conclusions of law, however, evaluate or resolve the credibility of the witnesses\u2019 accounts of the events of 1995 and 1996, which present different depictions of the father\u2019s domestic violence and the child\u2019s exposure to it. Nor do the findings address the \u201cthe effects of domestic violence on the child and the appropriateness of the . . . custody award in light of those effects.\u201d <em>Custody of Vaughn, supra </em>at 600.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-12\">The department argues that the judge has discredited the mother\u2019s testimony. It could also be argued that the judge considered the evidence of domestic violence to be stale and not reflective of present circumstances or positive gains by the father. See, e.g., <em>Adoption of Paula, </em>420 Mass. 716, 731 (1995); <em>Adoption of George, </em>27 Mass. App. Ct. 265, 268 (1989). The judge did refer to the father\u2019s general change of circumstances through his use of the department\u2019s services, including parenting classes and counseling. There is, however, nothing explicit about the judge\u2019s consideration of domestic violence.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-22\">In sum, although the evidence of domestic violence in this case may be dated, and in part disputed, it was sufficient to require the express consideration of the issue as set forth in <em>Custody of Vaughn. </em>Because the issue cannot be decided by implication, we remand the case for clarification of the judge\u2019s findings on domestic violence, its effects on the child, and its relationship to the father\u2019s ability to parent. See <em>Custody of Vaughn, supra </em>at 600; <em>Maalouf </em>v. <em>Saliba, </em>54 Mass. App. Ct. 547, 549, 551 (2002) (remand of an order granting father visitatian for findings consistent with <em>Custody of Vaughn </em>as codified in statutory directive of G. L. c. 208, \u00a7 31A, requiring judges to \u201cconsider evidence of past or present abuse ... as a factor contrary to the best interest of the child\u201d). As did the court in <em>Custody of Vaughn, supra, </em>\u201c[w]e do not by this decision require the judge to hear further testimony if [she] does not consider this necessary, but at the least [she] must hear both parties and make explicit findings on the matters set out above.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b176-37\">4. <em>Award of permanent custody to the father. </em>The mother and child also contend that the judge exceeded her authority when she awarded \u201cpermanent custody\u201d to the father pursuant to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 26.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> We need not resolve this question as we have remanded the case for more complete findings on the father\u2019s fitness, given the past incidents of domestic violence. We point out, however, that paternity has been conclusively established through court-ordered paternity testing and that the mother has been determined to be unfit. In these circumstances, \u201c[i]n a care and protection proceeding, custody belongs to a parent such as [the father] if he is not unfit.\u201d <em>Care &amp; Protection of Zelda, </em>26 Mass. App. Ct. 869, 871 (1989) (mother unfit and father acknowledged paternity in G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 24, proceeding in the Juvenile Court).</p>\n<p id=\"b177-5\">Accordingly, the judgment declaring the mother unfit is affirmed. The award of permanent custody to the father is vacated, and the case is remanded for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion. Pending those proceedings, temporary custody is to remain with the father.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b168-38\">According to counsel for the department, and as found by the trial judge, the State of New Hampshire conducted a home visit and evaluation as required by St. 1963, c. 452, \u00a7 1, art. III(d), and recommended that the child be placed with the father. Compare <em>Adoption of William, </em>433 Mass. 636, 644 (2001).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b169-8\">The only confirmed incidence of parasites related to head lice found on the child in the fall of 2000.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b169-9\">The mother told the department that she was \u201chome-schooling\u201d her child, but the judge found that she \u201chas not been certified to home school her daughter.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b170-7\">The mother and child correctly contest the judge\u2019s finding that the \u201cmother lived in <em>nine </em>different locations over a two year period\u201d (emphasis added).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b170-8\">The factual errors that the judge did make (see, e.g., note 5, <em>supra) </em>were insignificant given the extensive evidence concerning the mother\u2019s unfitness. See <em>Adoption of Helen, </em>429 Mass. 856, 859-861 (1999) (minor errors do not matter where ultimate conclusion of unfitness is thoroughly supported by record); <em>Adoption of Peggy, </em>436 Mass. 690, 702 (2002) (marginal errors harmless).</p>\n<p id=\"b170-9\">In this regard, we also note that the judge referenced the G.
