We conclude that the judge did err and vacate the judgment of modification.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-14\"><em>Background. </em>The parties\u2019 Complete Amended Stipulation and Property Settlement Agreement (Agreement), dated July 18, 1994, required the defendant to pay child support in the amount of $255 each week, with payments to increase to $475 as of June 15, 1998. At the time of their divorce, the parties had two children, Taylor, aged six,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and Trevor, aged two.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The Agree<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>ment made no provision for educational expenses. Article 2 of the Agreement did provide, however, that \u201c[s]upport payments shall continue for the CHILDREN until their majority, which for the puiposes of this Agreement shall mean attaining the age of eighteen or 23 if they are full time students enrolled in an undergraduate education program, principally depending upon and residing with the custodial parent.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b57-5\">The plaintiff filed a complaint for modification on December 11, 2001, seeking an increase in child support based on changed circumstances. Her complaint simply stated that the \u201ccost of bringing up [two] children has increased dramatically.\u201d The defendant counterclaimed for a reduction in child support, stating that the plaintiff had begun working and was earning in excess of $15,000 per year. A hearing was held on June 10, 2002.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-6\">In his June 12, 2002, finding of facts, the probate judge found that the children were fifteen and eleven years of age. The children both attended parochial schools, the tuition for which would be $5,000 per year as of September, 2002, for the older child and $2,000 for the younger child. The judge also found that since the entry of the existing support order, (1) the plaintiff had begun employment as an administrative assistant<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and was earning approximately $20,000 per year; and (2) the defendant, after \u201cmaxing out\u201d the income potential of the job he held at the time of the divorce, which was about $70,000 per year, had switched jobs and was earning a base salary of $170,000 per year, as well as bonuses, in a \u201chighly intense and competitive work environment.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b57-7\">In his discussion, the probate judge stated there was a \u201clack of any present agreement between the parties with respect to the sharing of education expenses.\u201d He also stated that \u201c[o]ne of the plaintiff\u2019s needs is to begin putting aside money for her share of future college expenses as the parties made no provision for same at the time of the divorce (although they did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>agree that support would continue up to age 23 if a child remained as a full-time undergraduate in a college program).\u201d The judge further stated, \u201c[i]f they wait until the children start college before addressing this expense they will not have sufficient time within which to set aside the necessary funds.\u201d The judge concluded that \u201cwhile it is true that a child support order much beyond the $620.50 order advocated by the defendant is more than enough to meet the <em>current expenses </em>of the children, it is not so when the <em>future college costs </em>of the children are considered\u201d (emphasis added). He ordered an increase in child support from $475 per week to $890.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The defendant timely filed his notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-4\"><em>Discussion. </em>General Laws c. 208, \u00a7 28, provides that \u201c[u]pan a complaint after a divorce, ... the court may make a judgment modifying its earlier judgment . . . provided that the court finds that a material and substantial change in the circumstances of the parties has occurred.\u201d The statute also authorizes the court to \u201cmake appropriate orders of maintenance, support and education of any child who has attained age eighteen but who has not attained age twenty-one and who is domiciled in the home of a parent, and is principally dependent upon said parent for maintenance.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Furthermore, this court has held that in appropriate circumstances, the need to pay actual college expenses may constitute a change in circumstances of the parties warranting modification of a divorce judgment. <em>Cabot </em>v. <em>Cabot, </em>55 Mass. App. Ct. 756, 765 (2002).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> For the reasons stated herein, however, we find that the Probate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>Court judge abused his discretion by modifying a divorce judgment to increase child support to provide for future college expenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-5\">\u201c[A]s a general rule, support orders regarding the future payment of post-high school educational costs are premature and should not be made.\u201d <em>Passemato </em>v. <em>Passemato, 427 </em>Mass. 52, 54 (1998). See <em>L.W.K. </em>v. <em>E.R.C., </em>432 Mass. 438, 452, 453 (2000) (emphasizing statutory age limitation on educational support awards); <em>Kotler </em>v. <em>Spaulding, </em>24 Mass. App. Ct. 515, 518 (1987) (judge is limited by \u201cstrictures\u201d of G. L. c. 208, \u00a7 28, when making order for \u201cmaintenance, support or education\u201d). Support orders must address the \u201ccurrent needs\u201d of the children. <em>Bush </em>v. <em>Bush, </em>402 Mass. 406, 410 (1988). See <em>L.W.K. </em>v. <em>E.R.C., supra </em>at 452-453 (educational awards should meet current needs of the child); <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Roe, </em>32 Mass. App. Ct. 63, 70 (1992). In this case, the Probate Court\u2019s judgment of modification and findings of fact make clear that much, if not all, of the increase beyond $620.50 was intended to cover future educational costs.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b59-6\">Although orders for future educational expenses may be upheld when the particular facts of the case justify them, the facts did not justify the order here. See <em>L.W.K. </em>v. <em>E.R.C., supra </em>at 454 (Probate Court judge lacked \u201cauthority to order future educational support to a child who has not yet attained the age of eighteen, because of the death of her father\u201d). The limited circumstances that do justify orders for future educational expenses have involved children with special needs or profligate parents. See <em>Passemato </em>v. <em>Passemato, supra </em>at 54-55; <em>Taverna </em>v. <em>Pizzi, </em>430 Mass. 882, 886 (2000). For example, in <em>Passemato, supra </em>at 55, \u201cthere was sufficient evidence of reckless economic and social behavior on the part of the wife,\u201d in addition to sufficient evidence that neither parent would \u201cbe able to provide for the future educational costs of the dependent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>children from their incomes alone.\u201d For those reasons, \u201cin the absence of the trust structure\u201d imposed, the court determined that \u201cit [was] unlikely that sufficient funds [would] remain for the children to obtain college educations.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Similarly, the court upheld an order for future educational expenses in <em>Taverna </em>v. <em>Pizzi, </em>430 Mass, at 886, where there were \u201cfindings that the defendant had denied, and had evaded, his financial duty to care for the child over the years.\u201d Furthermore, the twelve year old child \u201csuffered from birth with serious health problems requiring extensive medical care.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>The particular facts satisfied the court \u201cthat the order directing the defendant to establish a college education fund for the child was warranted.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 886.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b60-5\">In the instant case, the judge identified no special circumstances justifying the advance payment of future college expenses. The children were not found to have significant health problems, nor were the parents found to be irresponsible with their money.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The judge\u2019s sole finding was that if the parents wait until the children start college they will not have sufficient time to set aside the necessary funds. Given the cost of college education today, this is true for all but the wealthiest of parents. In these circumstances, where the children were fifteen and eleven years old<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> at the time of the judgment of modification, and there were no findings of special concerns regarding either the children or the parents, it remains the responsibility of the individual parents, without judicial intervention, to plan in advance for anticipated college expenses. As a result, any increase in the child support order beyond $620.50 per week, if <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>intended to pay for future college education expenses, was error. See note 6, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b61-4\"><em>Conclusion. </em>For the reasons stated herein, we vacate the judgment of modification awarding weekly child support payments in the amount of $890, and remand to the Probate and Family Court for the entry of a new judgment consistent with this opinion.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b61-5\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b56-15\">Taylor\u2019s date of birth is October 23, 1986.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b56-16\">Trevor\u2019s date of birth is October 7, 1990.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b57-8\">The Agreement also stated that \u201c[t]he wife and the husband have incorporated in this Agreement their entire understanding.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b57-9\">The plaintiff was not employed at the time of the divorce.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b57-10\">His new job required frequent travel and some curtailment of his regular alternate weekend visitation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b58-5\">A weekly payment of $620.50 was the amount of support calculated by applying the child support guidelines to the defendant\u2019s first $100,000 of annual earnings. This part of the modification was uncontested. The difference between $620.50 and $890 reflected an additional twenty percent of the next $70,000 of the defendant\u2019s income.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b58-6\">In the instant case, the judge found that there was no contractual agreement in place covering college education expenses. This interpretation of the Agreement is <em>correct. The </em>absence of such an agreement, or any express or implied intention to not be responsible for such payments, is not surprising given that the children were six and two at the time of the divorce and college was not on the \u201chorizon.\u201d See <em>Cabot </em>v. <em>Cabot, </em>55 Mass. App. Ct. at 764-765, distinguishing <em>McCarthy </em>v. <em>McCarthy, 36 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 490 (1994). See also G. L. c. 208, \u00a7 28 (\u201cmodification of child support may enter notwithstanding an agreement of the parents that has independent legal significance\u201d); <em>Benson </em>v. <em>Benson, </em>422 Mass. 698, 702 (1996).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b59-7\">The judge expressly found \u201cthat a child support order much beyond the $620.50 order advocated by the defendant is more than enough to meet the current expenses of the children,\u201d and went on to say that \u201cit is not so when the future college costs of the children are considered.\u201d Although stating that at least a portion of the amount in excess of $620.50 was not necessary to pay current expenses, the finding leaves room for the possibility that the judge had determined that some of the excess was necessary to pay such expenses. See note 12, <em>infra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b60-6\">Here, notably, there was no provision for a structured educational expense or trust fund. See <em>Passemato </em>v. <em>Passemato, supra </em>at 57 (trust imposed to secure order for future child support \u201cagainst the wife\u2019s documented inability to conserve her assets\u201d). All that was required under the order was an increase in the payments to the plaintiff, so that she would be able to pay for her as yet undetermined share of future college education expenses. The order offers no assurance that the money would in fact be set aside for future educational expense.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b60-7\">Changed circumstances to that effect might appropriately trigger a modification request.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b60-8\">Neither child was therefore approaching college age. We recognize, however, that the older child is now seventeen and actual college expenses may be imminent. See <em>Cabot </em>v. <em>Cabot, supra </em>at 765.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b61-6\">On remand the Probate Court should clarify whether any part of the difference between $620.50 and $890 was necessary to pay for current expenses necessitated by the parochial school tuition as opposed to future college expenses.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
