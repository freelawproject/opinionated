Pina, federal prisoner #24261-038, appeals the district court\u2019s denial of his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 petition for habeas corpus, arguing that the evidence was insufficient to support his prison disciplinary conviction that resulted in his forfeiting good time credits. We review for clear error the district court\u2019s factual findings and review de novo the district court\u2019s legal conclusions. <em>Jeffers v. Chandler, </em>253 F.3d 827, 830 (5th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b327-9\">Pina argues that the evidence was insufficient to show that he aided and abetted another prisoner in possessing a cell phone. \u201c[T]he requirements of due process are satisfied if some evidence supports the decision by the prison disciplinary board to revoke good time credits.\u201d <em>Superintendent, Mass. Corr. Inst., Walpole v. Hill, </em>472 U.S. 445, 455, 105 S.Ct. 2768, 86 L.Ed.2d 356 (1985). We are not required to examine the entire record, to assess independently the credibility of witnesses, or to weigh the evidence. <em>Id. </em>at 455, 105 S.Ct. 2768. \u201c[PJrison disciplinary proceedings will be overturned only where there is no evidence whatsoever to support the decision of the prison officials.\u201d <em>Reeves v. Pettcox, </em>19 F.3d 1060, 1062 (5th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b327-13\">It cannot be said in Pina\u2019s case that \u201cthere is no evidence whatsoever to support the decision of the prison officials\u201d that would require overturning the disciplinary proceeding. <em>See id. </em>In particular, the cell phone was found in Pina\u2019s work area, the phone\u2019s incoming and outgoing call log listed a telephone number found only on Pina\u2019s approved call list, and he stated that he thought another prisoner would take responsibility for having the cell phone.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-14\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b327-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
