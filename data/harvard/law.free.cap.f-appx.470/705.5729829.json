BALDOCK, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b734-10\">Melvin Ellis Holly, a federal prisoner appearing pro se, appeals the district court\u2019s order denying his motion asserting that he was denied due process because the court failed to look at the \u201ctrue facts\u201d at his criminal trial and because the district court\u2019s post-trial orders were defective for various reasons. Holly requests leave to proceed on appeal in forma pauperis (IFP). We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We deny leave to proceed IFP. We affirm in part and reverse and remand in part. In addition, we propose filing restrictions for Holly.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-13\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b734-14\">The facts underlying this appeal have been set forth in detail in several of this court\u2019s orders resolving prior appeals and petitions filed by Holly. Briefly,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b734-15\">Mr. Holly, a former sheriff, was convicted of numerous counts \u201crelated to the sexual abuse of inmates, employees, and an employee\u2019s daughter at the La-timer County jail.\u201d <em>United States v. Holly, </em>378 Fed.Appx. 852, 853 (10th Cir.2010). He has pursued a direct appeal, see <em>United States v. Holly, </em>488 F.3d 1298 (10th Cir.2007); a motion to vacate, set aside or correct his sentence under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, <em>see United States v. Holly, </em>364 Fed.Appx. 471 (10th Cir.2010); and various other forms of relief, see, <em>e.g., United States v. Holly, 435 </em>Fed.Appx. 732 (10th Cir.2011) (motion for a writ of audita querelaf; denial of authorization to file second \u00a7 2255 motion] ); <em>Holly, 378 </em>Fed.Appx. at 852 (motion for a new trial).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b734-16\"><em>United States v. Holly, </em>444 Fed.Appx. 309, 310 (10th Cir.2011) (dismissing appeal of \u201cMotion for Severance, 'Conflict of Interest\u2019 Change of Venue ... \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b734-17\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b734-18\">In this case, Holly asserts that he was denied due process. His claims can be divided into two categories. In the first, he attempts to re-argue various claims challenging his criminal convictions that could have been brought in his first 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion. In the second, he alleges that several of the district court\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"707\">*707</page-number>rulings denied him due process and that the district court judge was prejudiced against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-5\">\n<em>\u00a7 2255 Claims</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b735-6\">The claims raised in Holly\u2019s current appeal are merely another attempt torelitigate his \u00a7 2255 motion challenging his convictions. Moreover, this court has specifically rejected these claims in prior rulings.' Holly\u2019s claims raised here that have been specifically foreclosed are as follows: (1) he was administered the drug Haloperidol (brand name Haldol) during his trial, <em>see Holly, </em>435 Fed.Appx. at 736 (dismissing claim that \u201che was forced by prison officials to take Haloperidol prior to trial\u201d because it could not be raised in a second motion for habeas relief); (2) Jennifer Monteil\u2019s DNA was concealed from him, <em>see Holly, </em>378 Fed.Appx. at 854 (holding \u201cHolly\u2019s claim regarding concealed DNA evidence [was] merely impeaching,\u201d and therefore failed to satisfy the standard for a new trial); (3) sheriffs dispatcher Roberta Hughes furnished the female witnesses methamphetamine while they were in jail, promised each witness one million dollars to secure their statements that Holly had raped them, and then lied about having done so; she also lied about her own drug addiction, <em>see Holly, </em>435 Fed. Appx. at 736-37 (denying a certificate of appealability for absolutely unsupported claim that \u201cRoberta Hughes ... provided methamphetamine and an offer of one million dollars to any female inmate willing to testify against Holly\u201d); (4) Amber Helmert\u2019s drug convictions were not revealed to Holly before his trial, <em>see id. </em>(denying a certificate of appealability for claim that \u201cAmber Helmert, an inmate and one of Holly\u2019s victims, admitted to receiving methamphetamine from Roberta Hughes\u201d or was ever prosecuted for possession of methamphetamine); (5) the depositions of Amber Helmert, Roberta Hughes, Jennifer Monteil, Deborah Hendricks, Skipper Kistler, Tasha Nix, and Alicia Piper, which were taken as part of Holly\u2019s victims\u2019 subsequent civil suit against Latimer County, were contradictory to the testimony given at trial, <em>see id. </em>(noting that the civil depositions were taken over two years before Holly sought habeas relief and Holly was aware of at least some of the depositions when he filed his habeas motion; therefore, this evidence was not newly discovered and could not be brought in a second or successive \u00a7 2255 motion); (6) the complaining witnesses were given methamphetamine in the Latimer County Jail to induce their testimony that Holly had sexually battered them, <em>see id. </em>(denying a certificate of appealability for unsupported claim that Hughes provided methamphetamine to witnesses because it was merely impeaching and failed to satisfy the standard for a new trial); <em>Holly, </em>378 Fed.Appx. at 853-54 (rejecting claim of new evidence based on government\u2019s alleged \u201cdrug party\u201d for witnesses); (7) Holly\u2019s defense counsel had a conflict of interest, <em>see Holly, </em>364 Fed.Appx. at 472 (noting that in his request for a certificate of appealability to appeal the denial of his first \u00a7 2255 motion, Holly \u201cfail[ed] to show either an actual conflict of interest or an adverse effect on his counsel\u2019s performance\u201d); <em>Holly, </em>378 Fed.Appx. at 853 (rejecting Holly\u2019s motion for a new trial based on claim that \u201chis counsel had a conflict of interest\u201d because he \u201cfailed to demonstrate that he discovered this evidence after trial or that such evidence is material to the principal issues involved in his case\u201d); and (8) Holly was friends with the United States Attorney, who should have recused, <em>see Holly, </em>444 Fed.Appx. at 311-12 (dismissing Holly\u2019s \u201ccreatively titled motion\u201d attempting to bring an unauthorized second or successive \u00a7 2255 motion asserting that \u201cthe then-current United States At<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number>torney had a conflict of interest because he and Mr. Holly were longtime friends\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b736-4\">We conclude that these claims should be characterized as challenges to Holly\u2019s convictions. Included in this category are Holly\u2019s assertions in the underlying motion that the district court violated his due process rights in rejecting new evidence and in failing to consider his claims ab initio. All of those claims should have been construed as a request to file a second or successive \u00a7 2255 motion and dismissed. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(a); <em>In re Cline, </em>531 F.3d 1249, 1251 (10th Cir.2008) (per curiam) (\u201cA district court does not have jurisdiction to address the merits of a second or successive \u00a7 2255 ... claim until this court has granted the required authorization.\u201d). We have previously approved the district court\u2019s recharacterization of Holly\u2019s claims as an unauthorized second or successive \u00a7 2255 motion. <em>See Holly, </em>444 Fed.Appx. at 312 (holding district court \u201ccorrectly recognized that [Holly\u2019s] motion presented second or successive \u00a7 2255 claims that [the court] lacked jurisdiction to consider\u201d); <em>Holly, </em>435 Fed.Appx. at 734 (\u201cWe conclude that the district court correctly recharacterized Holly\u2019s motion as a second motion for habeas relief and that it correctly dismissed the motion for lack of jurisdiction.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b736-5\">We recognize that Holly has titled his current iteration of his claims as a violation of due process, but he asserts and reasserts claims of error in his convictions, so his request for relief must be treated like a second or successive \u00a7 2255 motion. As this court has explained to Holly,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b736-6\">A prisoner\u2019s post-judgment filing (however entitled) should be treated like a second or successive \u00a7 2255 motion if it asserts or reasserts claims of error in the prisoner\u2019s conviction. <em>See Gonzalez v. Crosby, </em>545 U.S. 524, 531-32, 125 S.Ct. 2641, 162 L.Ed.2d 480 (2005); <em>United States v. Nelson, </em>465 F.3d 1145, 1147 (10th Cir.2006); <em>see also Melton v. United States, </em>359 F.3d 855, 857 (7th Cir.2004) (\u201cCall it a motion for a new trial, arrest of judgment, mandamus, prohibition, coram nobis, coram vobis, audita querela, certiorari, capias, habeas corpus, ejectment, quare impedit, bill of review, writ of error, or an application for a Get-Out-Of-Jail Card; the name makes no difference.\u201d). <em>We recently explained as much to Mr. Holly in connection with his motion for a writ of audita querela. See Holly, </em>435 Fed.Appx. at 734-35.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b736-8\"><em>Holly, </em>444 Fed.Appx. at 311 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b736-9\">We have catalogued Holly\u2019s current claims to make clear that the filing restrictions we propose below are warranted. Nevertheless, we remand these claims to the district court with instructions to re-characterize them as a second or successive \u00a7 2255 motion, and to dismiss them for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-10\">\n<em>District Court\u2019s Rulings</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b736-11\">Holly also claims that the district court denied him due process by (1) relying on a brief by the U.S. Attorney in a matter concerning John Lester Ruston, even though Holly does not know Ruston; (2) delaying in ruling on his \u00a7 2255 motion filed on October 24, <em>2008; </em>and (3) denying his July 2010 motion for a new trial before he had an opportunity to reply to the government\u2019s opposition, and not notifying him of the ruling promptly (although he does not challenge the district court\u2019s statement that the order was mailed to his last known address). Holly further contends that the district court should have held an evidentiary hearing and that the judge was biased and prejudiced against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"709\">*709</page-number>Holly has demonstrated no error or prejudice relating to a brief referencing Ruston. We perceive no impropriety in the district court\u2019s timeliness in ruling on Holly\u2019s motions or in mailing orders to his last known address. Holly was not entitled to an evidentiary hearing to rehash his second and successive attempts to relitigate his \u00a7 2255 motion. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(b) (indicating that no hearing is required where it is conclusive \u201cthat the prisoner is entitled to no relief\u2019). Finally, Holly\u2019s bare assertion that the district court judge was biased and prejudiced against him appears to be based solely on adverse rulings, a position this court has explained to him does not warrant disqualification under Tenth Circuit law. <em>Holly, </em>364 Fed.Appx. at 472 (\u201c[T]he only grounds for disqualification Holly advances concern adverse rulings by the district court judge and fantastical conspiracy theories.... Neither ground is sufficient to warrant disqualification.\u201d); <em>In re Holly, </em>No. 09-7052 (10th Cir. June 4, 2009) (order denying mandamus relief; holding that a claim based on the district court judge\u2019s prior adverse rulings is not \u201ca basis for seeking recusal\u201d). Therefore, the district court\u2019s judgment on these claims is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-5\">Filing Restrictions</p>\n<p id=\"b737-6\">As discussed above, Holly has attempted to raise claims and arguments that have all been resolved in prior appeals. Because these issues have previously been resolved against him, his appeal is frivolous. <em>See Braley v. Campbell, </em>832 F.2d 1504, 1510 (10th Cir.1987) (holding that \u201c[a]n appeal is frivolous when the result is obvious, or the appellant\u2019s arguments of error are wholly without merit\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b737-7\">\u201cThe right of access to the courts is neither absolute nor unconditional, and there is no constitutional right of access to the courts to prosecute an action that is frivolous or malicious.\u201d <em>Winslow v. Hunter (In re Winslow), </em>17 F.3d 314, 315 (10th Cir.1994) (per curiam) (internal quotation marks omitted) (alteration omitted). \u201cFederal courts have the inherent power to regulate the activities of abusive litigants by imposing carefully tailored restrictions in appropriate circumstances.\u201d <em>Andrews v. Heaton, </em>483 F.3d 1070, 1077 (10th Cir.2007). This court may impose an injunction \u201cwhere the litigant\u2019s lengthy and abusive history is set forth; the court provides guidelines as to what the litigant may do to obtain its permission to file an action; and the litigant receives notice and an opportunity to oppose the court\u2019s order before it is implemented.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201c[P]ro se litigants are subject to the same minimum litigation requirements that bind all litigants and counsel before all federal courts. We emphasize today that we will scrutinize equally all filings by both pro se and counseled litigants to protect against [abusive litigation].\u201d <em>Kyler v. Everson, </em>442 F.3d 1251, 1253-54 (10th Cir.2006); <em>cf. Haworth v. Royal (In re Haworth), </em>347 F.3d 1189, 1191-92 (10th Cir.2003) (imposing sanctions against a pro se litigant for, among other things, challenging matters that had been decided in a prior appeal).</p>\n<p id=\"b737-9\">In addition to the six appellate proceedings described above, Holly has filed the following three matters in this court: <em>Holly v. Gotcher, </em>427 Fed.Appx. 634, 636 (10th Cir.2011) (holding claims brought under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 were \u201cbased on the argument that he was deprived of due process [which] implicitly questioned] the validity of his convictions\u201d that had not been vacated; the due-process claims were therefore barred); <em>United States v. Holly, </em>No. 10-7101 (10th Cir. Apr. 26, 2011) (appeal of claims based on convictions dismissed for lack of prosecution); <em>In re Holly, </em>No. 10-7092 (10th Cir. Jan. 25, 2011) (order dismissing for failure to prosecute complaint <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"710\">*710</page-number>\u201cwhich the district court construed as an attempt to file an unauthorized second or successive 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion\u201d). Moreover, in his supplemental notice of appeal in this case, Holly has acknowledged that the issues raised here \u201chad been brought up before\u201d and declared that the same \u201cissues will be brought up in the lower court until the court puts these issues before a jury.\u201d R. Doc. 172 at 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-4\">This court has distinguished between \u201clitigants who have repeatedly abused the appellate process\u201d and \u201cthose who have limited their repetitive filings to a particular subject.\u201d <em>Ford v. Pryor, </em>552 F.3d 1174, 1181 (10th Cir.2008) (collecting cases). Thus far, Holly\u2019s claims have been based on his criminal convictions and various proceedings related to them. It does not appear \u201c(at least as yet)\u201d that he is \u201clikely to abuse the legal process in connection with other persons and subject matters.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted). Accordingly, we conclude that Holly\u2019s appellate filings warrant imposing filing restrictions limited to the claims brought in his prior appellate proceedings and arguments related to those claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-5\">Therefore, Holly is restricted from filing any further pro se filings with this court raising claims decided in his prior appellate cases cited above. In addition, this court will not accept any further pro se appeals or original proceedings filed by Holly that raise claims related to the claims brought in his prior appellate cases. The clerk of this court shall return any such filings, unfiled, to Holly.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-6\">Holly shall have ten days from the date of this order and judgment to file written objections to these proposed filing restrictions. His response shall be limited to fifteen pages. If Holly does not file an objection, the filing restrictions shall take effect twenty days from the date of this order and judgment. If Holly does file timely objections, these filing restrictions shall take effect only if the court rules against Holly and rejects his objections. In that event, the filing restrictions shall apply to any matter filed after that ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-8\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b738-9\">Holly\u2019s motion to proceed IFP on appeal is DENIED. Holly\u2019s claims deemed to be an attempt to file a second or successive \u00a7 2255 motion are REVERSED and REMANDED to the district court with instructions to dismiss them for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. The district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED in all other respects. Holly\u2019s objections, if any, to the proposed filing restrictions described above are due within ten days of this order and judgment.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b734-11\"> After examining the briefs and appellate record, this panel has determined unanimously that oral argument would not materially assist the determination of this appeal. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument. This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed. R.App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
