Our jurisdiction is governed by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence the agency\u2019s factual findings, <em>Zehatye v. Gonzales, </em>453 F.3d 1182, 1184-85 (9th Cir.2006), and we review de novo due process claims, <em>Martinez-Rosas v. Gonzales, </em>424 F.3d 926, 930 (9th Cir.2005). We deny in part and dismiss in part the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-11\">Substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s denial of Hernandez-Mejia\u2019s asylum claim because he failed to demonstrate he was or will be harmed on account of a protected ground. <em>See INS v. Elias-Zacanas, </em>502 U.S. 478, 482-83, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992) (even if the petitioner holds a political opinion, he still must establish targeting because of that political opinion). Accordingly, Hernandez-Mejia\u2019s asylum claim fails. <em>See Ochoa v. Gonzales, </em>406 F.3d 1166, 1172 (9th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b666-16\">Hernandez-Mejia contends the agency applied the incorrect legal standard to his cancellation of removal claim, and in particular, failed to consider his ability to work and support his children in El Salvador. The record belies this contention. Because the agency applied the correct legal standard, we lack jurisdiction to review the agency\u2019s discretionary hardship determination. <em>See Mendez-Castro v. Mukasey, </em>552 F.3d 975, 980 (9th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b666-17\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED in part; DISMISSED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"A2j\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
