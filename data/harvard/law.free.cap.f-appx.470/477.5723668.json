We AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-15\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b506-16\">On July 17, 2010, two women flagged down a Detroit Police patrol vehicle and informed the officers that a man was shooting an \u201cAK-47\u201d in the Sojourner Truth Homes, a housing project in Detroit. As the officers approached the housing complex, they heard several shots. The officers parked their vehicle and approached on foot.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-17\">The parties disagree as to what happened next. In its sentencing memorandum, consistent with the Police Investigator\u2019s Report, the United States represented that as the officers approached 18081 Fenelon Drive, Defendant appeared at the front door holding an AK-47 assault rifle and walked out of the house onto the front porch. Defendant shouted at the other residents and waived the AK-47 in the air. One of the officers immediately ordered Defendant to drop his weapon and step away from the house, but Defendant ignored the order and went back inside, shutting and locking the door behind him. The police reported to dispatch that they had \u201ca barricaded gunman.\u201d The police learned that the owner of the house, Michelle Harris, was inside, along with several children.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-18\">Defendant remained downstairs alone while the police told him to come out with the weapon. According to both the Police Investigator and Harris, after roughly twenty minutes, one of the officers convinced Defendant to exit the house unarmed. Defendant was immediately arrested. Inside the house, the officers recovered Defendant\u2019s loaded AK-47, underneath a bed, as well as a .22-caliber <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>rifle that belonged to him, in the lower hallway closet. Thus, according to the United States, Defendant disobeyed the police by retreating into the home with a loaded firearm.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-5\">Defendant, on the other hand, claimed that he was already inside the home when the police arrived. In support, he relied on statements made by Harris to police the day after the incident. Harris told police that after Defendant finished firing, he walked back into the house and slammed the door shut. Harris stated that the officers did not arrive until five minutes after the shots. Thus, Defendant claimed that, because he was already inside the home, his only act of resistance was a brief two \u2014 to five \u2014 minute delay in exiting the home at the officers\u2019 orders.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-6\">Defendant pleaded guilty to one count of felon in possession of a firearm, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> This gave Defendant a base offense level of 20. The presentence report recommended a four-level sentencing enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(6), for use of a firearm in connection with the commission of another felony offense, namely using an AK-47 to resist arrest. The presentence report found that Defendant had violated Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. \u00a7 750.81d(l), which makes it a felony to assault, batter, wound, resist, obstruct, or endanger a police officer. The presentence report also recommended a three-point reduction for acceptance of responsibility. This resulted in a total offense level of 21. Defendant\u2019s criminal history category was IV. Without the section 2K2.1(b)(6) enhancement, the sentencing guidelines range would have been 37 to 46 months. With the enhancement, the recommended sentencing guidelines range was 57 to 71 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-7\">Defendant objected to the section 2K2.1(b)(6) enhancement on the ground that he \u201cdid not resist and obstruct the police department,\u201d relying on Harris\u2019s statement that he had re-entered the home before the police arrived. The United States countered that the factual dispute was irrelevant because even if Defendant\u2019s version of events were credited, the fact that he barricaded himself was also \u201cresisting, obstructing, and impeding.\u201d R. 23 at 5. Defendant responded that \u201c[t]he most you can say is it took him a couple of minutes, two to five minutes to come out of the house, and I don\u2019t see that as resisting or obstructing.\u201d R. 23 at 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-8\">The district court determined that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-9\">It\u2019s a long two to five minutes when you see someone, they have a high-power weapon and they\u2019re behind the door, it\u2019s a pretty long time for police officers to be standing there and to \u2014 I just don\u2019t buy your argument. He came out. He had the weapon, the police gave him a direction. He didn\u2019t follow the direction. And more importantly, did he not follow the direction he went inside and whether he locked the door, didn\u2019t lock the door, I don\u2019t think is the issue, the issue is he restricted them from doing their duty. Even if it took ten seconds, somebody could get hurt and potentially the police officers. So I think that your objection to \u2014 the report as written by Probation is correct and your objections are noted, but I don\u2019t think they apply in this case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ABYU\">R. 23 at 6-7. The court found that \u201cthe situation here was very, very extreme,\u201d R. 23 at 13, and sentenced Defendant to 71 months in prison at the highest end of the guidelines range. Defendant appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-10\">II. Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b507-11\">We review the application of a section 2K2.1(b)(6) enhancement under a specific <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>standard. <em>See United States v. Taylor, </em>648 F.3d 417, 431-32 (6th Cir.2011). Factual findings are reviewed for clear error, and due deference is given to the district court\u2019s determination that the firearm was used or possessed in connection with another felony. <em>Id. </em>To the extent a challenge to the application of the section 2K2.1(b)(6) enhancement presents strictly a question of law, de novo review applies. <em>Id. </em>at 431.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-4\">The advisory guidelines provide for a four-level enhancement to the defendant\u2019s base offense level \u201c[i]f the defendant used or possessed any firearm or ammunition in connection with another felony offense.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(6) (2009). To apply the section 2K2.1(b)(6) enhancement, the district court must find that the government has established by a preponderance of the evidence that the defendant (1) committed another felony, and (2) used or possessed a firearm in connection with that offense. <em>United States v. Mojica, </em>429 Fed.Appx. 592, 594 (6th Cir.2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b508-5\">According to the application notes, the \u201cin connection with\u201d element of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(6) requires that the firearm \u201cfacilitated, or had the potential of facilitating, another felony offense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>cmt. n. 14(A). \u201cAnother felony offense\u201d is defined as \u201cany federal, state, or local offense, other than the explosive or firearms possession or trafficking offense, punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year, regardless of whether a criminal charge was brought, or a conviction obtained.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 2K2.1(b)(6) cmt. n. 14(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b508-6\">This court has held that section 2K2.1(b)(6) requires the government to establish, by a preponderance of the evidence, a nexus between the firearm and an independent felony. <em>United States v. Burns, </em>498 F.3d 578, 580 (6th Cir.2007) (internal citations omitted). In other words, the government must prove that \u201cthe connection between the firearm and the other felony was not merely coincidental, that the firearm served some purpose in relation to the other offense, such as emboldening] the defendant in committing it.\u201d <em>United States v. Berkey, </em>406 Fed.Appx. 938, 939 (6th Cir.2011) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). <em>See also United States v. Coleman, </em>627 F.3d 205, 212 (6th Cir.2010) (holding that a firearm or ammunition facilitates the commission of a felony if it makes it \u201ceasier or less difficult,\u201d or if it serves \u201csome emboldening role in a defendant\u2019s felonious conduct\u201d (internal quotation marks, alteration, and citation omitted)), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 2473, 179 L.Ed.2d 1231 (2011). The firearm \u201cneed not be actively used\u201d in the other offense. <em>United States v. Angel, </em>576 F.3d 318, 320 (6th Cir.2009) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). This court has also recognized that \u201cdemonstrating this nexus is not a particularly onerous burden.\u201d <em>United States v. Davis, </em>372 Fed.Appx. 628, 629 (6th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b508-10\">Here, the \u201cother felony\u201d is resisting arrest under Michigan law, which states that \u201can individual who assaults, batters, wounds, resists, obstructs, opposes, or endangers a person who the individual knows or has reason to know is performing his or her duties is guilty of a felony.\u201d Mich. Comp. Laws \u00a7 750.81d(l). The act of obstructing an officer from performing his or her duties \u201cincludes the use or threatened' use of physical interference or force <em>or a knowing failure to comply with a lawful command.\u201d Id. </em>\u00a7 750.81d(7)(a) (emphasis added). <em>See also United States v. Mosley, </em>575 F.3d 603, 607 (6th Cir.2009) (holding that Mich. Comp. Laws \u00a7 750.81(d)(1) contains \u201cat least two categories\u201d of violations, including violations \u201cinvolving an individual who \u2018obstructs\u2019 an officer through \u2018a know<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>ing failure to comply with a lawful command\u2019 \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b509-5\">Defendant argues on appeal that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AXl\">Without making clear whether it believed that Mr. Jones had actively resisted arrest by fleeing the police while armed as the Government maintained, or merely passively resisted arrest by hesitating to exit the Fenelon house as the defense argued, the district court determined that Mr. Jones\u2019s possession of a firearm facilitated the offense of resisting arrest. Because it appears to have been based on the legal conclusion that the form of resistance was immate<em>rial </em>\u2014 ie., that the firearm facilitated even the passive resistance in the form of Mr. Jones delaying his exit from the house \u2014 the district court\u2019s finding was in error.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b509-6\">Appellant\u2019s Br. at 11. He asserts that \u201c[e]ven assuming that Mr. Jones\u2019s passive failure to exit the Fenelon house immediately constituted a violation of M.C.L. \u00a7 750.81(d)(1) \u2014 a premise he disputed below but will not reargue for purposes of this appeal \u2014 that particular crime was not furthered by the presence of a firearm.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 9. He asks this court to remand for resentencing, \u201cmaking clear that Mr. Jones\u2019s possession of a firearm was merely coincidental to his brief delay in following police orders to exit a home and did not \u2018further\u2019 that conduct.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b509-7\">No matter how he paints the district court\u2019s ruling, Defendant\u2019s variegated argument fails.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> First of all, contrary to Defendant\u2019s assertion, the district court actually found as a matter of fact that Defendant was outside when the police order was issued: \u201cHe came out. He had the weapon, the police gave him a direction. He didn\u2019t follow the direction. And more importantly, did he not follow the direction he went inside.\u201d R. 28 at 6-7. Later, in exercising its authority to apply the advisory guideline, the court specifically found that \u201che didn\u2019t respond to the police officers\u2019 lawful request, that he went back into the house which again created a horrible situation for both the police officers.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-10\">Second, the district court found that even at \u201ctwo to five minutes\u201d Defendant \u201cknowingly fail[ed] to comply with a lawful command,\u201d Mich. Comp. Laws \u00a7 750.81d(7)(a), which is what the \u201cother felony\u201d statute at issue in this case requires. In other words, the district court was not obliged to characterize Defendant\u2019s resistance as either \u201cactive\u201d or \u201cpassive.\u201d <em>See also Angel, </em>576 F.3d at 320 (stating that the firearm \u201cneed not be actively used\u201d in the other felony offense for purposes of a section 2K2.1(b)(6) enhancement (internal quotation marks and citation omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b509-11\">Third, the record supports the conclusion that the firearm \u201cfacilitated, or had the potential of facilitating\u201d the other felony. Defendant never disputed he had easy access to the weapon and the district court clearly found that even with a brief delay the police officers could potentially get hurt. <em>Cf. id. </em>at 321-22 (noting that the defendant\u2019s objection did not specifically address the finding that the firearms were possessed \u201cin connection with\u201d another felony, but that under either a preserved or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>unpreserved error standard, the district court did not err in applying the section 2K2.1(b)(6) standard). Defendant had a loaded AK-47 with him in a locked house. The residents of the home (as well as his own children) were hiding from him upstairs. Whether he received an order to drop the weapon before he retreated into the house or merely heard the police order him to immediately exit the house, as the district court found, Defendant admittedly \u201cneglected to exit a home immediately when police ordered him to do so.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Br. at 14. As the United States points out, if Defendant had been unarmed, the police could have entered the house and arrested him. However, \u201cbecause Jones was armed with a high-power assault rifle, the police were constrained to surround the house and attempt to coax Jones to surrender before he used his weapon to injure himself, the police, or the woman and children barricaded inside.\u201d Appellee\u2019s Br. at 9-10. Therefore, possessing the AK-47 facilitated Jones in resisting arrest by making it easier for him to avoid coming out of the house.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-4\">Moreover, the AK-47 \u201cemboldened\u201d Defendant in resisting arrest. As noted, the AK-47 was loaded and operational. Defendant knew the officers knew he had it because they had ordered him to drop it. The gun\u2019s presence put the police on notice that he was armed and dangerous. The weapon made it easier for Defendant to \u201cdelay\u201d complying with a direct police order. It prevented the officers from storming the house to rescue the women and children and increased the risk of violence by heightening the potential need for the police to use force if Defendant did not ultimately surrender. <em>Cf. Coleman, </em>627 F.3d at 212 (applying the enhancement where \u201cthe ammunition emboldened [the defendant] in the knowledge that he was one step closer to having a fully-loaded firearm to protect himself and his illegal drugs, and the ammunition potentially served notice to potential buyers that [the defendant] was a step closer to having a fully-loaded firearm\u201d). Like the district court, we think that two to five minutes is a long time to \u201chesitate to obey\u201d a police order to drop an AK-47 and submit to arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-6\">As this court has explained, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(6) \u201cwas created in response to a concern about the increased risk of violence when firearms are used or possessed during the commission of another felony.\u201d <em>United States v. Burke, </em>345 F.3d 416, 427 (6th Cir.2003) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). <em>See also United States v. Hurst, </em>228 F.3d 751, 763 (6th Cir.2000) (same). We think the district court correctly recognized that this is precisely the kind of situation the enhancement was intended to address. We therefore hold that the court application of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(6) to the facts of this case was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-7\">III. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b510-8\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b507-12\">. There was no Rule 11 plea agreement.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b509-8\">. In the district court Defendants focused on the \u201cother felony\u201d aspect of section 2K2.1(b)(6). There Defendant alleged that he was inside the house when the police issued their order and that he responded within two to five minutes. He contended that he did not resist and obstruct the police department in violation of Mich. Comp. Laws \u00a7 750.81d(l). On appeal, his argument is focused on the \u201cin connection with\u201d element of the guideline. The government takes no issue with Defendant\u2019s altered argument on appeal, so we decide the matter using a de novo standard of review.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
