Hans argues that the district court erred in refusing to credit the 508 days that he spent at the halfway house toward his 120-month sentence. After careful review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-8\">We review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s denial of a habeas corpus petition. <em>Cook v. Wiley, </em>208 F.3d 1314, 1317 (11th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b884-9\">Section 3585(b) of Title 18 provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AW2\">A defendant shall be given credit toward the service of a term of imprisonment for any time he has spent in official detention prior to the date the sentence commences\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b884-10\">(1) as a result of the offense for which the sentence was imposed; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b884-11\">(2) as a result of any other charge for which the defendant was arrested after the commission of the offense for which the sentence was imposed;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b884-12\">that has not been credited against another sentence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b884-13\">18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3585(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b884-14\">In <em>Reno v. Koray, </em>the Supreme Court considered the meaning of \u201cofficial detention\u201d in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3585(b). 515 U.S. 50, 52, 55-56, 115 S.Ct. 2021, 132 L.Ed.2d 46 (1995). The Court considered whether a defendant who was released to a Volunteers of America (\u201cVOA\u201d) community treatment center pending sentencing, but whose \u201crelease order\u201d required that he be \u201cconfined to [the] premises\u201d and was without \u201cauthoriz[ation] to leave for any reason\u201d unless accompanied by a government agent was in \u201cofficial detention.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 52-53, 115 S.Ct. 2021. The Court held that a defendant suffers \u201cdetention\u201d only when committed to the custody of the Attorney General; a defendant who is admitted to bail on restrictive conditions is \u201creleased.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 57, 115 S.Ct. 2021. The Court acknowledged that under this definition a defendant could be \u201creleased\u201d even though he or she was subject to restraints that did not materially differ from those imposed on \u201cdetained\u201d defendants. <em>Id. </em>at 62-63, 115 S.Ct. 2021. The Court explicitly rejected the notion that the determination of whether or not a person was in \u201cofficial detention\u201d depended- on whether he or she was subjected to \u201cjail-type confinement.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 64, 115 S.Ct. 2021. The Court concluded that the time the defendant spent at the VOA community treatment center while \u201creleased\u201d on bail was not \u201cofficial detention,\u201d and thus, the defendant was not entitled to credit against his sentence of imprisonment. <em>Id. </em>at 65, 115 S.Ct. 2021.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-16\">As applied here, the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Koray </em>forecloses Hans\u2019s argument that his \u201cjail-like\u201d confinement at the VOA facility qualified for \u00a7 3585(b) credit. Like the defendant in <em>Koray, </em>Hans was released to a VOA facility and prevented from leaving the facility by the conditions of his release order. Hans argues on appeal that documents in the record indicate that he was not released, but was rather still in custody. The record does not support this assertion. Hans signed and initialed the \u201cOrder Setting Conditions of Release,\u201d which clearly indicates that he was being released subject to certain conditions, including his residence at the VOA <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"857\">*857</page-number>facility on lockdown status. The fact that the district court issued an order stating that Hans was released from the VOA facility does not mean that his residence at the VOA was \u201cofficial detention,\u201d since, among other things, this order does not describe Hans\u2019s residence at the VOA facility as \u201ccustody\u201d or \u201cdetention.\u201d Likewise, the fact that the \u201cPetition to Enter Plea of Guilty\u201d provided that he could be considered for release prior to his trial does not mean that he was in \u201cofficial detention\u201d at the time it was signed. The provision Hans relies on is merely a recitation of the rights he had if he elected to plead \u201cnot guilty.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b885-5\">Hans also seeks to distinguish his case on the basis that he was required to reside at the VOA facility for the government\u2019s benefit. But there is nothing in <em>Koray </em>to suggest that the definition of \u201cofficial detention\u201d would change based on the government\u2019s rationale for requesting certain conditions of release. Therefore, the district court did not err in denying Hans\u2019s \u00a7 2241 petition based on the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Koray</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b885-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b885-8\">. Moreover, we decline to consider Hans's request in his reply brief that we consider Justice Ginsburg\u2019s concurrence in <em>Koray, </em>since we do not address arguments raised for the first time in a <em>pro se </em>litigant\u2019s reply brief. <em>Lovett v. Ray, </em>327 F.3d 1181, 1183 (11th Cir.2003).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
