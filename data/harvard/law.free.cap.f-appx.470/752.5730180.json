After review, we affirm.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b780-28\">Under \u00a7 3582(c)(2), a district court has the authority to modify a defendant\u2019s term <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"753\">*753</page-number>of imprisonment if the defendant\u2019s sentence was \u201cbased on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission pursuant to 28 U.S.C. [\u00a7 ] 994(o).\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2); <em>see also </em>U.S.S'.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(l). However, if the retroactively applicable amehdment to the guidelines \u201creduee[d] a defendant\u2019s base offense level, but does not alter the sentencing range upon which his or her sentence was based, \u00a7 3582(c)(2) does not authorize a reduction in sentence.\u201d <em>United States v. Moore, </em>541 F.3d 1323, 1330 (11th Cir.2008); <em>see also </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(2)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b781-6\">A sentence reduction is not authorized if the amendment does not lower a defendant\u2019s applicable guidelines range \u201cbecause of the operation of another guideline or statutory provision.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10 cmt. n.l(A). Thus, when defendant\u2019s applicable guidelines range is determined by his status as an armed career criminal, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.4, and not by the amount of crack cocaine involved in his offense, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c), the defendant is not eligible for \u00a7' 3582(c)(2) relief based on recent amendments to the base offense levels in \u00a7 2Dl.l(c) for crack cocaine offenses. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Thomas, </em>545 F.3d 1300, 1301-02 (11th Cir.2008) (involving \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion based on Amendment 706).</p>\n<p id=\"b781-7\">Here, the district court did not err in denying Thomas\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion. Thomas\u2019s motion was based on Amendment 750, which changed the drug quantity tables in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c) to conform to the Fair Sentencing Act of 2010. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. app. C, amends. 750, 759 (making Amendment 750 retroactive); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(c) (listing Amendment 750 as an amendment for which a defendant may file a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion). Because Thomas was designated an armed career criminal at his original sentencing, his offense level was based on U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.4, not on the drug quantity tables in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c). <em>See Thomas, </em>545 F.3d at 1301.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Thus, Amendment 750 had no effect on Thomas\u2019s ultimate sentencing range.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-11\">We find no merit to Thomas\u2019s argument that he is eligible for \u00a7 3582(c)(2) relief because U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.4\u2019s armed career criminal enhancement applied only to his firearm conviction (Count 1) and not to his two crack cocaine convictions (Counts 2 and 3). At sentencing, the district court grouped all three counts for purposes of calculating Thomas\u2019s offense level, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3D1.2(c). The court then determined that the applicable offense level was 34, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B 1.4(b)(3)(A). Thus, Thomas\u2019s offense level for all three counts was based on \u00a7 4B1.4(b)(3)(A), which was not changed by Amendment 750.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-12\">For these reasons, the district court correctly concluded that Thomas was ineligible for a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) sentence reduction.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-13\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b780-20\">. \"We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s conelusions about the scope of its legal authority <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"753\">*753</page-number>under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2).\u201d <em>United States v.

In <em>Thomas, </em>we affirmed the district court\u2019s denial of Thomas\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion because Thomas was sentenced as an armed career criminal under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.4. 545 F.3d at 1301. Thomas concedes that our earlier <em>Thomas </em>opinion controls, but states that he brings his challenge to preserve it for possible future appeals.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
