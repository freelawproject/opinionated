R.App. P. 34(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b717-6\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b717-7\">Damon and Claudia Lyman appeal from the district court\u2019s order dismissing on the pleadings their action alleging violations o'f the Truth in Lending Act (\u201cTILA\u201d), the Real Estate Settlement and Procedures Act (\u201cRE SPA\u201d), and California\u2019s Unfair Competition Law (\u201cUCL\u201d). We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review de novo, <em>Dunlap v. Credit Prot. Ass\u2019n, LP, </em>419 F.3d 1011, 1012 n. 1 (9th Cir.2005) (per curiam), and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-8\">The district court properly dismissed the Lymans\u2019 TILA damages claim as time-barred because their action was not filed within one year of the alleged violations. <em>See </em>15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1640(e) (an action for damages must be brought within one year of the alleged violation); <em>King v. California, </em>784 F.2d 910, 915 (9th Cir.1986) (holding that \u201cthe limitations period in Section 1640(e) runs from the date of consummation of the transaction\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b717-9\">The district court properly dismissed the Lymans\u2019 RE SPA claim as time-barred because their action was not filed within one year of the alleged violations. <em>See </em>12 U.S.C. \u00a7 2607 (prohibition against kickbacks and unearned fees); 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 2614 (proscribing a one-year statute of limitations for violations of \u00a7 2607). Contrary to the Lymans\u2019 contention, the district court did not abuse its discretion by declining to apply equitable tolling because the Lymans did not allege facts showing that the alleged violations could not have been discovered by a reasonable plaintiff within the limitations period. <em>See Huynh v. Chase Manhattan Bank, </em>465 F.3d 992, 1003 (9th Cir.2006) (decision to apply equitable tolling reviewed for an abuse of discretion).</p>\n<p id=\"AK_\">The district court properly dismissed the Lymans\u2019 UCL claim as preempted by the Home Owners\u2019 Loan Act because their allegations fall within the categories listed in 12 C.F.R. \u00a7 560.2(b). <em>See Silvas v. E*Trade Mortg. Corp., </em>514 F.3d 1001, 1005-06 (9th Cir.2008) (Home Owners\u2019 Loan Act preempted UCL claims based on loan-related fees and lender\u2019s disclosure obligations).</p>\n<p id=\"b717-14\">The Lymans\u2019 remaining contentions, including those regarding bringing their TILA damages claims as a recoupment defense, are unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-15\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b717-10\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
