The Court has considered all of Powell\u2019s specifications of error, including:</p>\n<p id=\"b885-22\">(1) whether two of Powell\u2019s prior state convictions, which serve as the basis for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"858\">*858</page-number>his Armed Career Criminal Act (ACCA) enhancement, were \u201ccommitted on occasions different from one another,\u201d as required by 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e);</p>\n<p id=\"b886-4\">(2) whether a jury must determine beyond a reasonable doubt the facts underlying the ACCA\u2019s statutory requirements, specifically, whether the prior crimes were committed on different occasions;</p>\n<p id=\"b886-5\">(3) whether the district court improperly admitted evidence pursuant to Fed. R.Evid. 404(b), and failed to grant a mistrial;</p>\n<p id=\"b886-6\">(4) whether parts of the government\u2019s closing statement provided grounds for a mistrial;</p>\n<p id=\"b886-7\">(5) whether the effects of the trial errors cumulatively denied Powell a fair trial;</p>\n<p id=\"b886-8\">(6) whether the jury instructions constructively amended the indictment;</p>\n<p id=\"b886-9\">(7) whether the evidence was sufficient to support the convictions;</p>\n<p id=\"b886-10\">(8) whether the information that supplied probable cause to search Powell\u2019s residence was stale; and</p>\n<p id=\"b886-11\">(9) whether 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g) is a constitutional exercise of Congress\u2019s authority under the Commerce Clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-12\">After review and consideration of the briefs and the record, and having the benefit of oral argument, we find no harmful error in the proceedings in the district court.
