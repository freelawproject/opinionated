We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence, <em>Zehatye v. Gonzales, </em>453 F.3d 1182, 1184-85 (9th Cir.2006), and we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-18\">Substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s finding that, even if credible, Jin did not establish past persecution because the detention and physical abuse Jin experienced in China did not rise to the level of persecution. <em>See Gu v. Gonzales, </em>454 F.3d 1014, 1019-21 (9th Cir.2006). In addition, substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s finding that Jin\u2019s fear of future persecution was not objectively reasonable. <em>See id. </em>at 1022. Accordingly, Jin\u2019s asylum claim fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-19\">Because Jin failed to meet his burden for asylum, it necessarily follows that he did not meet the more stringent standard for withholding of removal. <em>See Zehatye, </em>453 F.3d at 1190.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-20\">Finally, substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s denial of CAT relief because Jin failed to establish' it is more likely than not he will be tortured if returned to China. <em>See Nahrvani v. Gonzales, </em>399 F.3d 1148, 1154 (9th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b633-21\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b633-16\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
