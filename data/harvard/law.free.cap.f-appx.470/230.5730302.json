The Plaintiffs, Edward Wallner and his ROTH IRA (collectively \u201cWallner\u201d), brought suit, alleging, among other things, common-law and statutory fraud and civil conspiracy. After a four-day trial, the jury returned a verdict in favor of Wallner for common-law fraud, statutory fraud, and civil conspiracy.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-4\">The only challenge on appeal is to the denial of the motion for new trial. The Defendant-Appellant, Michael Ziegler (\u201cZiegler\u201d), argues that the jury\u2019s award of exemplary damages was not supported by clear and convincing evidence and that counsel\u2019s closing arguments were improper and prejudiced the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-5\">Our review of the denial of a motion for new trial \u201cis more limited than when one is granted.\u201d <em>DP Solutions, Inc. v. Rollins, Inc., </em>353 F.3d 421, 431 (5th Cir.2003) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). This Court \u201cmust affirm the district court\u2019s denial of [a] motion for a new trial absent a \u2018clear showing of an abuse of discretion.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Hidden Oaks Ltd. v. City of Austin, </em>138 F.3d 1036, 1049 (5th Cir.1998)). This Court\u2019s review of a denial of a motion for new trial on the ground of insufficient evidence is very limited in that a district court \u201cwill be deemed to have abused its discretion in denying a new trial [only] when there is an absolute absence of evidence to support the jury\u2019s verdict.\u201d <em>Irvan v. Frozen Food Exp., Inc., </em>809 F.2d 1165, 1166 (5th Cir.1987) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Further, a \u201cdistrict court may order a new trial if improper closing argument irreparably prejudices a jury verdict or if a jury fails to follow instructions.\u201d <em>Nissho-Iwai Co., Ltd. v. Occidental Crude Sales, Inc., </em>848 F.2d 613, 619 (5th Cir.1988). Using these standards as our guideposts, we hold that Ziegler has not made a clear showing of an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-9\">Ziegler contends that counsel\u2019s closing argument was prejudicial in that counsel urged the jury to assume that certain individuals who were not called to testify would have given testimony unfavorable to Ziegler. This Court \u201chas long recognized that a party\u2019s failure to call available witnesses or produce evidence that would clarify or explain disputed factual issues can give rise to a presumption that the evidence, if produced, would be unfavorable to that party.\u201d <em>United States v. Wilson, </em>322 F.3d 353, 363 (5th Cir.2003). For the presumption to apply, the missing witness must have \u201csome sort of connection to the party, such that one would expect that the missing witness\u2019s testimony would corroborate that party\u2019s theory of the case, such as a party\u2019s employee or attorney whose legal advice was at issue.\u201d <em>United States v. Santos, </em>589 F.3d 759, 764 (5th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b260-10\">Counsel made the \u201cmissing witness\u201d argument in reference to Randyl Meigs, the attorney for two companies owned by Ziegler. Counsel also made this argument in reference to Jason Love and Erick Farish, who both worked for and were officers of TDHB, which is owned by Ziegler. Accordingly, the missing witnesses all had a connection to Ziegler. Thus, it \u201ccannot be said that [these witnesses were] as available\u201d to Wallner as to Ziegler. <em>McClanahan v. United States, </em>230 F.2d 919, 925 (5th Cir.1956). Because the missing witnesses all had a connection to Ziegler such that one would expect their testimony to corroborate Ziegler\u2019s story, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>Ziegler has not shown that counsel\u2019s argument was improper.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b261-5\">Ziegler next contends that counsel\u2019s remarks with respect to Ziegler\u2019s financial condition constituted plain error. \u201cThis Court will consider errors to which no objections were made at trial but will exercise this power only in exceptional cases where the interest of substantial justice is at stake, [citation omitted]. To reverse, this Court must find plain error.\u201d <em>Shipman v. Central Gulf Lines, Inc., </em>709 F.2d 383, 388 (5th Cir.1983).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b261-6\">Ziegler\u2019s principal challenge is to counsel\u2019s rhetorical question to the jury during closing argument: \u2018Who knows whether they have transferred all of their funds to friends?\u201d Wallner does not point to any evidence showing that Ziegler transferred funds to his friends. Because there was no evidence of Ziegler\u2019s transferring funds to friends, counsel\u2019s assertion was improper. <em>Alaniz v. Zamora-Quezada, </em>591 F.3d 761, 778 (5th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b261-7\">In an attempt to show that the interest of substantial justice is at stake, Ziegler cites to <em>Hall v. Freese, </em>735 F.2d 956 (5th Cir.1984). In <em>Hall, </em>the plaintiffs counsel failed to object to opposing counsel\u2019s assertions that were either false or without basis in the record. Although this Court strongly condemned counsel\u2019s misconduct, it expressly stated that it \u201cwould not reverse the district court in this case on the basis of these remarks alone, absent a timely objection.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 962. Ultimately, however, this Court reversed because, after reviewing the evidence, counsel\u2019s unfair argument, and the damages verdict, it concluded that substantial injustice had been done. <em>Id. </em>at 961-62. More specifically, although the plaintiff was severely disabled for life, the jury awarded her a total of $55,000. <em>Id. </em>at 961.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-11\">In contrast, in the instant case, with respect to compensatory damages, the jury awarded Wallner what he had invested in the ventures, $1,500,000. The award of exemplary damages was $150,000, one-tenth of the compensatory damages. Thus, the verdict does not plainly indicate the remarks prejudiced the jury. The district court found that, because the evidence introduced at trial overwhelmingly supported a finding of fraud, counsel\u2019s arguments did not warrant a new trial. The court further found that, to the extent counsel\u2019s statements were improper, \u201cthe weight of the evidence presented at trial minimized any prejudicial effect of such statements.\u201d Moreover, the district court\u2019s instructions that counsel\u2019s arguments did not constitute evidence and that the jury should only consider the evidence introduced at trial effectively minimized any prejudice flowing from improper remarks. <em>Learmonth v. Sears, Roebuck and Co., </em>631 F.3d 724, 732-33 (5th Cir.2011). Accordingly, Ziegler has not shown plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-12\">Finally, Ziegler contends that the district court erred in denying his motion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>for new trial because Wallner did not establish by clear and convincing evidence that Ziegler committed fraud. <em>See </em>Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem.Code \u00a7 41.003(a)(1). The court\u2019s jury charge defined \u201cclear and convincing evidence\u201d as \u201cevidence that produces in your minds a firm belief or conviction as to the truth of the allegations sought to be established.\u201d Ziegler does not challenge this instruction on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-4\">At trial, Ziegler admitted that Wallner had traded a $1 million debt owed to Wallner by TDHB \u2014 a company that owned real property such as townhomes, apartment complexes, and condo projects \u2014 for shares of stock in Triad, a company with virtually no assets or business. Additionally, the jury was free to believe Wallner\u2019s testimony that Ziegler failed to inform him that TDHB lacked sufficient cash to repay the debt at the time Wallner rolled it over. Further, the evidence demonstrated that Ziegler used Wallner\u2019s $500,000 to purchase a tract of land in Waxahachie in the name of the 777 Development Group, a company that Wallner was not aware existed. Wallner testified that he would not have rolled over the $1 million note and invested an additional $500,000 in Triad had he known of the 777 Development Group. Wallner also testified he would not have invested the additional $500,000 if he had known that TDHB did not have $1 million to repay the note. In light of this evidence, Ziegler cannot show that \u201cthere is an absolute absence of evidence to support the jury\u2019s verdict.\u201d <em>Irvan, </em>809 F.2d at 1166. Thus, the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion for new trial based on insufficient evidence of fraud.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b262-6\">For the above reasons, the district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b259-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b261-8\">. Ziegler also contends that counsel\u2019s reference during closing argument to Love as \u201cthe other partner in this scam\u201d was improper argument and prejudiced the jury. Although Ziegler claims there was no evidence that Love was complicit in the fraud, the evidence demonstrates .that Love was a partner in TDHB and that he assisted in preparing the proposal that was used to defraud Wallner. Ziegler has thus failed to show that this argument was improper.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b261-13\">. Ziegler argues that counsel\u2019s urging the jury to consider why the defendants had not introduced financial records flouted the court\u2019s ruling that no reference should be made with respect to Ziegler\u2019s filing of bankruptcy on the eve of trial. Because counsel\u2019s remarks do not explicitly refer to the filing of bankruptcy, they do not constitute plain error.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b262-5\">. Ziegler also contends that Wallner\u2019s experience as a sophisticated businessman precludes a finding of justifiable reliance on Ziegler\u2019s representations. Although Wallner was certainly an experienced businessman, the evidence does not establish that it was \"extremely unlikely\u201d that he actually relied on the defendant\u2019s misrepresentations. <em>Haralson v. Hutton Group, Inc., </em>919 F.2d 1014, 1026 (5th Cir.1990), <em>abrogated on other grounds, Gustafson v. Alloyd Co., Inc., </em>513 U.S. 561, 115 S.Ct. 1061, 131 L.Ed.2d 1 (1995).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
