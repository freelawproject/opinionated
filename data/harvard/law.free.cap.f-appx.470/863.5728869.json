On appeal, Morgan argues the condition prohibiting him from serving his supervised release in Florida is not reasonably related to the relevant 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors and involves a deprivation of liberty greater than reasonably necessary for the purposes of \u00a7 3553(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b891-21\">Although Morgan now argues the district court erred in prohibiting him from serving his supervised release term in Florida, Morgan invited this alleged error. At the sentencing hearing, the district court stated that Morgan was to be released in California, where he had been serving his previous term of supervised release. Defense counsel did not object and instead requested that Morgan \u201clive in Las Vegas instead of California.\u201d Because Morgan invited the district court to impose a term of supervised release in Nevada, we are precluded from reviewing his claim of alleged error on appeal. <em>See United States v. Brannan, </em>562 F.3d 1300, 1306 (11th Cir.2009) (\u201cWhere a party invites error, [we are] precluded from reviewing that error on appeal.\u201d).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b891-22\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b891-24\">. Alternatively, the district court did not plainly err in imposing this special condition. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"864\">*864</page-number>It is within a court\u2019s discretion to impose such a limitation as a condition of supervised release, <em>see </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3563(b)(13), and the condition takes account of Morgan\u2019s criminal history and the need to protect the public from harm by preventing Morgan\u2019s release to Florida, where he previously threatened the life of a judge and a prosecutor.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
