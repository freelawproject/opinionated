Garcia, a <em>pro se </em>federal prisoner, appeals the September 8, 2011 order of the district court for the Northern District of Florida (\u201cNorthern District\u201d) denying his petition for writ of habeas corpus filed pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241. After review, we vacate the Northern District\u2019s September 8, 2011 order and remand with directions that the action be re-transferred back to the Southern District of Florida (\u201cSouthern District\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b764-6\">Garcia filed this \u00a7 2241 petition challenging his 1999 sentence. Garcia filed his \u00a7 2241 petition in the Southern District, the district where he is incarcerated. The Southern District did not reach the merits of Garcia\u2019s \u00a7 2241 petition. Instead, over Garcia\u2019s objection, the Southern District construed Garcia\u2019s \u00a7 2241 petition as a motion to vacate his sentence under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 and transferred the case to the Northern District, the district where Garcia originally was convicted and sentenced.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-7\">In the Northern District, a magistrate judge issued a report (\u201cR&amp;R\u201d) recommending that Garcia\u2019s petition be dismissed. Garcia filed an objection, arguing that his sentencing claim fell within the savings clause of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(e) and thus he was entitled to relief \u201cby the appropriate jurisdictional forum.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b764-8\">The district court in the Northern District denied Garcia\u2019s \u00a7 2241 petition with prejudice. The Northern District first noted that Garcia had demonstrated a clear intent to file his petition pursuant to \u00a7 2241 and that the case was improperly transferred to the Northern District. The Northern District determined, however, that re-transferring the case to the Southern District would be futile in light of this Court\u2019s ruling in <em>Gilbert v. United States, </em>640 F.3d 1293 (11th Cir.2011) (en banc). Instead, the Northern District, applying <em>Gilbert, </em>concluded that Garcia\u2019s particular sentencing claim did not fall within the savings clause, and thus Garcia could not challenge his sentence pursuant to \u00a7 2241.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-10\">On appeal, Garcia continues to insist that what he filed in the Southern District was a \u00a7 2241 petition and that the sentencing claim he raises falls within the savings clause. Given that Garcia has consistently maintained that he intends to bring a \u00a7 2241 petition, Garcia\u2019s \u00a7 2241 petition should not have been re-characterized by the Southern District as a \u00a7 2255 motion. <em>See Wyatt v. United States, </em>574 F.3d 455, 460 (7th Cir.2009) (explaining that courts \u201cmust respect a litigant\u2019s decision to invoke a certain statute\u201d). Moreover, jurisdiction for \u00a7 2241 petitions lies only in the district of confinement, <em>in </em>this case the Southern District. <em>See Rumsfeld v. Padilla, </em>542 U.S. 426, 443, 124 S.Ct. 2711, 2722, 159 L.Ed.2d 513 (2004); Fed R.App. P. 22. Therefore, Garcia\u2019s \u00a7 2241 petition should not have been transferred to the Northern District, and the Northern District did not have jurisdiction to reach the merits of savings clause issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-11\">For these reasons, we vacate the September 8, 2011 order and judgment of the district court in the Northern District and remand to the Northern District with directions to re-transfer the action back to the Southern District. After re-transfer, the Southern District shall then address Garcia\u2019s \u00a7 2241 petition, shall not re-characterize the petition as a \u00a7 2255 motion, and shall determine whether the savings clause applies to Garcia\u2019s sentencing claim, <em>see Gilbert, </em>640 F.3d 1293.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-12\">VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
