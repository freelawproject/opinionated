The district court stayed the execution pending disposition of the \u00a7 1983 claim. The County appealed immediately, moving this Court to vacate the stay. This Court instead requested that the parties submit supplemental briefing the following week. The execution warrant expired in the meantime.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-23\">In its supplemental brief, the County acknowledged that there remained untested physical evidence despite a 2010 order from the state trial court that \u201cany other available evidence that has not already been tested be tested.\u201d The County\u2019s brief asserts, however, that the remaining evidence has now been delivered to the Bexar County Criminal Investigations Laboratory and is \u201cin the process of being tested.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b433-24\">Neither party has addressed whether the County\u2019s assertion, if true, moots the underlying \u00a7 1983 case. Even so, we must raise that question <em>sua sponte </em>because it implicates the justiciability of the \u00a7 1983 suit going forward.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> At this juncture, however, when a record barely exists, the mootness determination depends on record development that does not commonly take place in appellate courts. The district court is the proper forum for developing the record requisite to a determination of mootness.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b434-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>We therefore remand this case for the limited purpose of determining in the first instance whether the case is now moot. We retain jurisdiction over the County\u2019s motion to vacate the stay. In other words, this is a LIMITED REMAND.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b433-20\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
