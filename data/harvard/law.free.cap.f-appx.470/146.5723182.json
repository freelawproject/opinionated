Ford argues that the district court committed reversible error in permitting the Government to introduce evidence of prior acts pursuant to Fed. R.Evid. 404(b). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-20\">We review a district court\u2019s evidentiary rulings for abuse of discretion and will reverse only if the court \u201cacted arbitrarily or irrationally in admitting evidence.\u201d <em>United States v. Basham, </em>561 F.3d 302, 326 (4th Cir.2009) (internal quotation marks omitted). Under this court\u2019s longstanding precedent, evidence is admissible under Rule 404(b) when it is relevant to an issue other than the defendant\u2019s general character, necessary, and reliable, and when the probative value of the evidence is not substantially outweighed by unfair prejudice. <em>United States v. Queen, </em>132 F.3d 991, 997 (4th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b174-21\">\u201cA not-guilty plea puts one\u2019s intent at issue and thereby makes relevant evidence of similar prior crimes when that evidence proves criminal intent.\u201d <em>United States v. Sanchez, </em>118 F.3d 192, 196 (4th Cir.1997). On appeal, Ford does not fairly challenge the reliability or prejudicial effect of the disputed evidence. Rather, he argues that the district court relied on a legal fiction in concluding that his intent was at issue in his trial. However, as the district court correctly predicted, the defense\u2019s cross-examination, as well as Ford\u2019s own testimony, placed his intent at issue by provid<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>ing an innocent explanation for his assistance and interaction with the criminal defendants whom he is accused of extorting. Thus, we conclude that the challenged testimony was both relevant and necessary to establish Ford\u2019s knowing and voluntary participation in the charged conspiracy.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> <em>See Queen, </em>132 F.3d at 996-97; <em>Sanchez, </em>118 F.3d at 196; <em>see also United States v. Yearwood, </em>518 F.3d 220, 225-26 (4th Cir.2008) (elements of conspiracy).</p>\n<p id=\"b175-5\">Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s judgment. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b175-16\"> To the extent Ford asks this court to replace our prior precedent with a categorical rule prohibiting the use of Rule 404(b) evidence to prove general intent, we decline his invitation. <em>See United States v. Bullard, </em>645 F.3d 237, 246 (4th Cir.)
