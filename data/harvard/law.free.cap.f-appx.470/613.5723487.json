He appeals his sentence of 171 months of imprisonment. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-9\">1. The district court did not err when it refused to calculate and grant time-served credit for Shareef s incarceration in Canada and the United Kingdom while he awaited extradition on these charges. \u201c[District courts lack authority at sentencing to give credit for time served.\u201d <em>United States v. Peters, 470 </em>F.3d 907, 909 (9th Cir.2006) (applying <em>United States v. Wilson, </em>503 U.S. 329, 112 S.Ct. 1351, 117 L.Ed.2d 593 (1992)). \u201c[T]he prerogative to grant credits in the first instance rests with the Attorney General, acting through the Bureau of Prisons.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 909 (citing <em>Wilson, </em>503 U.S. at 333-35, 112 S.Ct. 1351). Not only was there no error here, but the government has shown that Shareef was accorded credit for time-served by the Bureau of Prisons.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-12\">2. The district court properly rejected Shareef s request for a two-level reduction in his offense level because he consented to extradition pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K2.0. The agreement regarding this potential reduction in offense level was part of a plea offer that Shareef never accepted. Therefore, Shareef was not entitled to the benefit of the proposed plea agreement. <em>Cf. United States v. Clark, </em>218 F.3d 1092, 1095 (9th Cir.2000) (\u201cPlea agreements are contractual in nature and are measured by contract law standards.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b642-13\">3. The district court did not err when it calculated Shareefs sentence under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2F1.1 using a loss amount of $1.8 million. At sentencing, Shareef explicitly withdrew the objection he had made to the higher loss amount set forth in the Presentence Report. When the district court reduced the loss amount to $1.8 million, counsel stated that he did not dispute that amount. Claims of sentencing errors that were forfeited at sentencing are reviewed for plain error. <em>United States v. Evans-Martinez, </em>530 F.3d 1164, 1167 (9th Cir.2008). To determine whether there was plain error, we apply the familiar test set out in <em>United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 733, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993). Here, there was no error, let alone a clear error affecting substantial rights, in the district court\u2019s determination of a loss amount that Shareef agreed to at sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-14\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b642-10\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
