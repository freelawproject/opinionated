Garvan Murtha, of the United States District Court for the District of Vermont, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b61-5\">\n<em>SUMMARY ORDER</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b61-6\">Plaintiff-Appellant Timothy Hanrahan, Jr., <em>pro se, </em>appeals from the judgment of the United States District Court for the Northern District of New York (Scullin, J.) granting summary judgment in favor of the defendants-appellees and dismissing Hanrahan\u2019s complaint. We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts, the procedural history of the case, and the issues on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-7\">We review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment, \u201cconstruing the evidence in the light most favorable to the non-moving party and drawing all reasonable inferences in its favor.\u201d <em>Costello v. City of Burlington, </em>632 F.3d 41, 45 (2d Cir.2011); <em>see </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b61-8\">To substantiate an Eighth Amendment claim for medical indifference, a plaintiff must prove that the defendant was deliberately indifferent to a serious medical need. <em>See Farmer v. Brennan, </em>511 U.S. 825, 834-35, 114 S.Ct. 1970, 128 L.Ed.2d 811 (1994). A deliberate indifference claim requires a showing of both objective and subjective elements. <em>Smith v. Carpenter, </em>316 F.3d 178, 183-84 (2d Cir.2003). \u201cObjectively, the alleged deprivation must be sufficiently serious, in the sense that a condition of urgency, one that may produce death, degeneration or extreme pain exists.\u201d <em>Hathaway v. Coughlin, </em>99 F.3d 550, 553 (2d Cir.1996) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). Where the allegation is that the defendant failed to provide any treatment for the medical condition, \u201ccourts examine whether the inmate\u2019s medical condition is sufficiently serious.\u201d <em>Salahuddin v. Goord, </em>467 F.3d 263, 280 (2d Cir.2006). Where the challenge is to the adequacy of the treatment provided, such as in cases where treatment is alleged to have been delayed or interrupted, the seriousness inquiry focuses on \u201cthe particular risk of harm faced by a prisoner due to the challenged deprivation of care, rather than the severity of the prisoner\u2019s underlying medical condition, considered in the abstract.\u201d <em>Smith, </em>316 F.3d at 186. Moreover, \u201ca prisoner does not have the right to choose his medical treatment as long as he receives adequate treatment.\u201d <em>Hill v. Curcione, </em>657 F.3d 116, 123 (2d Cir.2011); <em>see also Chance v. Armstrong, </em>143 F.3d 698, 703 (2d Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b61-11\">\u201cSubjectively, the official charged ... must act with a sufficiently culpable state of mind.\u201d <em>Curcione, </em>657 F.3d at 122 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted); <em>see also Chance, </em>143 F.3d at 703. A person acts with deliberate indifference to an inmate\u2019s health or safety only if he \u201cknows of and disregards an excessive risk to inmate health or safety; the official must both be aware of facts from which the inference could be drawn that a substantial risk of serious harm exists, and he must also draw the inference.\u201d <em>Farmer, </em>511 U.S. at 837, 114 S.Ct. 1970.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-12\">Having reviewed the record and proceedings below, we affirm the district court\u2019s judgment for substantially the same reasons articulated by the district court in its March 31, 2011 order, which referenced and adopted the report and recommendation of the magistrate judge made on December 15, 2010. Moreover, to the extent that Hanrahan challenges the magistrate judge\u2019s denial of his motions to compel, he has waived his right to appellate review because he failed to timely <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>object to the magistrate judge\u2019s order. <em>See Caidor v. Onondaga Cnty., </em>517 F.3d 601, 605 (2d Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b62-4\">We have considered all of Hanrahan\u2019s remaining arguments and find them to be without merit. For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is hereby AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
