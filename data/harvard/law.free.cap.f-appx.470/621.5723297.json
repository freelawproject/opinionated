We have jurisdiction under <em>8 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence, <em>Chebchoub v. INS, </em>257 F.3d 1038, 1042 (9th Cir.2001), and we deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-8\">Substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination based on the inconsistencies between Saroy\u2019s testimony and asylum application regarding Saroy\u2019s participation in political activities, as well as internal inconsistencies in his testimony regarding when he changed his name from Rakesh Kumar to Rakesh Singh. <em>See id. </em>at 1043; <em>Farah v. Ashcroft, </em>348 F.3d 1153, 1156 (9th Cir.2003) (credible establishment of applicant\u2019s identity is a key element of the asylum claim). The IJ reasonably rejected his explanations for the inconsistencies. <em>See Rivera v. Mukasey, </em>508 F.3d 1271, 1275 (9th Cir.2007). In the absence of credible testimony, Saroy\u2019s asylum and withholding of removal claims fail. <em>See Farah, </em>348 F.3d at 1156.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-12\">Because Saroy\u2019s CAT claim is based on the same testimony found to be not credible, and he points to no other evidence the agency should have considered, substantial evidence also supports the denial of CAT relief. <em>See id. </em>at 1156-57.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-13\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b650-10\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
