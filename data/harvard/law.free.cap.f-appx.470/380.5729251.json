Sanders appeals his conviction of embezzlement of union funds in violation of 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 501(c), for which he was sentenced to 18 months of imprisonment and $10,078.40 of restitution. He argues that the district court erred in overruling his objection, based on <em>Batson v. Kentucky, </em>476 U.S. 79, 106 S.Ct. 1712, 90 L.Ed.2d 69 (1986), that the Government\u2019s decision to strike one of the prospective jurors was racially motivated. However, we have held that a defendant waives appellate review of a <em>Batson </em>claim by failing to dispute the prosecution\u2019s race-neutral explanation for striking the prospective juror. <em>United States v. Arce, </em>997 F.2d 1123, 1126-27 (5th Cir.1993). By failing to dispute the Government\u2019s explanations, Sanders appeared to acquiesce in them. <em>See id. </em>at 1127.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-21\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b408-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
