Niblock argues that his challenge to a conflict between the oral and written judgments was properly brought in a \u00a7 2241 petition because the error occurred after the sentencing proceeding. He further reasserts the substance of the claim, alleging that the conflict between the judgments constitutes error. Niblock also contends that he is actually innocent of the offense of conviction because the Government withheld favorable evidence. Because he is alleging a claim of actual innocence, Niblock asserts that the savings clause of \u00a7 2255 is applicable. Additionally, Niblock contends that his trial counsel rendered ineffective assistance by failing to communicate to him a favorable plea offer, and only his recent discovery of this fact allowed him to raise this claim in a \u00a7 2241 petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-8\">Under \u00a7 2241, we review findings of fact for clear error and conclusions of law de novo. <em>Christopher v. Miles, </em>342 F.3d 378, 381 (5th Cir.2003). Because Niblock\u2019s \u00a7 2241 claims attacked the validity of his conviction and sentence, the district court did not err in determining that the claims would be properly brought in a \u00a7 2255 motion. <em>See Pack v. Yusuff, </em>218 F.3d 448, 451 (5th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b419-9\">A petitioner can attack the validity of his conviction and sentence in a \u00a7 2241 petition only if he can meet the requirements of the savings clause of \u00a7 2255(e). <em>Kinder v. Purdy, </em>222 F.3d 209, 212 (5th Cir.2000). The petitioner shoulders the burden of affirmatively showing that the remedy under \u00a7 2255 would be \u201cinadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his detention.\u201d \u00a7 2255(e); <em>Reyes-Requena v. United States, </em>243 F.3d 893, 901 (5th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b419-14\">Niblock has not shown that his claim \u201cis based on a retroactively applicable Supreme Court decision which establishes that [he] may have been convicted of a nonexistent offense.\u201d <em>See Reyes-Requena, </em>243 F.3d at 904. Thus, he has not shown that he is entitled to proceed under the savings clause of \u00a7 2255. <em>See </em>\u00a7 2255(e); <em>Reyes-Requena, </em>243 F.3d at 904. To the extent that Niblock argues that the dismissal of his \u00a7 2241 petition impermissibly suspends the writ of habeas corpus, we have \u201cheld that the savings clause under \u00a7 2255 does not violate the Suspension Clause.\u201d <em>Wesson v. United States Penitentiary Beaumont, TX, </em>305 F.3d 343, 347 (5th Cir.2002) (relying on <em>Reyes-Requena, </em>243 F.3d at 901 n. 19).</p>\n<p id=\"b419-15\">Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b419-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
