The district court did not err in denying Stevens\u2019s claim. Under \u00a7 3585(b), Stevens was not entitled to credit against his federal sentence for that period because he received credit toward the state sentence he was serving at the time the federal sentence was imposed. <em>See Cotton v. Tamez, </em>283 Fed.Appx. 214, 215 (5th Cir.2008); <em>Miramontes v. Driver, </em>243 Fed.Appx. 855, 856 (5th Cir.2007). Even if it intended to do so, the district court did not have the authority under \u00a7 3585(b) to award credit against Stevens\u2019s federal sentence for the time he spent in state custody or to order that his federal sentence run absolutely concurrently with his prior state sentence. <em>See United States v. Wilson, </em>503 U.S. 329, 333-37, 112 S.Ct. 1351, 117 L.Ed.2d 593 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b331-22\">Stevens contends that the Government waived any objection by failing to object or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>appeal the judgment. Because he raised this argument for the first time on appeal, review is limited to plain error. <em>See Puckett v. United States, </em>556 U.S. 129, 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009). Stevens has not shown that it is clear and obvious under existing law that the Government waived this issue; therefore, he has not shown plain error. <em>See id.; United States v. Vega, </em>332 F.3d 849, 852 n. 3 (5th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b332-4\">According to Stevens, the BOP\u2019s failure to comply with the judgment violated the Separation of Powers Doctrine. Because he raised this issue for the first time on appeal, review is limited to plain error. <em>See Puckett, </em>556 U.S. at 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423. Stevens has not shown that it is clear and obvious under the existing law that the BOP\u2019s action violated the Separation of Powers Doctrine; therefore, he has not shown plain error. <em>See id.; Vega, </em>332 F.3d at 852 n. 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-5\">In addition, Stevens maintains that the sentencing court had the authority to and should have adjusted his sentence pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3584 and U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5G1.3. Because this contention challenges Stevens\u2019s sentence, Stevens may not raise it a \u00a7 2241 proceeding unless he can demonstrate that he is entitled to relief under the \u201csavings clause\u201d of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(e); and he has failed to do so. <em>See Pack v. Yusuff, </em>218 F.3d 448, 451 (5th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b332-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b331-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
