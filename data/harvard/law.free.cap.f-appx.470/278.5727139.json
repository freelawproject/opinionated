Hall argued that she was convicted of a nonexistent offense in light of <em>Skilling v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 2896, 2907, 177 L.Ed.2d 619 (2010), which held that the honest-services fraud statute, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1346, criminalizes only conduct involving bribery and kickback schemes. Hall alleged that <em>Slcill</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number><em>ing </em>rendered her actually innocent because her fraud offense did not involve bribery or kickbacks. The district court dismissed the petition for lack of jurisdiction on the basis that Hall failed to satisfy the \u201csavings clause\u201d of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-5\">Under \u00a7 2241, we review factual findings for clear error and conclusions of law de novo. <em>Christopher v. Miles, </em>342 F.3d 378, 381 (5th Cir.2003). We may affirm the district court\u2019s judgment on any basis supported by the record. <em>Berry v. Brady, </em>192 F.3d 504, 507 (5th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b307-6\">A \u00a7 2241 petition that attacks custody resulting from a federally imposed sentence may be entertained under the savings clause of \u00a7 2255 if the petitioner establishes that the remedy provided under \u00a7 2255 is \u201cinadequate or ineffective\u201d to test the legality of his detention. <em>Tolliver v. Dobre, </em>211 F.3d 876, 878 (5th Cir.2000). The savings clause is applicable only to a claim that (i) \u201cis based on a retroactively applicable Supreme Court decision which establishes that the petitioner may have been convicted of a nonexistent offense\u201d and that (ii) \u201cwas foreclosed by circuit law at the time when the claim should have been raised in the petitioner\u2019s trial, appeal, or first \u00a7 2255 motion.\u201d <em>Reyes-Requena v. United States, </em>243 F.3d 893, 904 (5th Cir.2001). The petitioner bears the \u201cstringent\u201d burden of affirmatively showing that the \u00a7 2255 remedy is inadequate or ineffective and that she is entitled to avail herself of the \u201climited exception\u201d found in the savings clause. <em>Christopher, </em>342 F.3d at 382.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-7\">Hall has not made such a showing. The record does not support that Hall\u2019s actual-innocence claim was foreclosed by circuit law at the time when the claim could have been raised previously. To the contrary, the record shows that Hall raised an actual-innocence claim specifically invoking <em>Skilling </em>in her first \u00a7 2255 motion and that the district court decided the claim on the merits; the district court specifically considered whether <em>Skilling </em>established Hall\u2019s actual innocence and determined that it did not. Accordingly, Hall had an adequate and effective opportunity to assert the present claim in her prior \u00a7 2255 motion. The fact that the claim was unsuccessful \u2014 or that future \u00a7 2255 motions raising the claim would be considered successive \u2014 does not establish that the \u00a7 2255 remedy is inadequate or ineffective. <em>See Kinder v. Purdy, </em>222 F.3d 209, 213 (5th Cir.2000); <em>Pack v. Yusuff, </em>218 F.3d 448, 452-53 (5th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b307-9\">Furthermore, the holding in <em>Skilling </em>does not support Hall\u2019s claim that she was convicted of a nonexistent offense. The Supreme Court held in <em>Skilling </em>that \u00a7 1346 criminalizes only bribery and kickback schemes. <em>Skilling, </em>130 S.Ct. at 2933. However, Hall was convicted of wire fraud in violation of \u00a7 1341, and there were no allegations that her fraud was based upon an honest-services theory. Instead, the record shows that Hall was charged with, and convicted of, conventional wire fraud under \u00a7 1341, i.e., Hall obtained tangible money or property by means of false or fraudulent representations. Thus, the holding in <em>Skilling </em>is neither relevant nor applicable to Hall.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-10\">Because Hall has not shown that a previously unavailable Supreme Court case has decriminalized her conduct, she cannot challenge her conviction in a \u00a7 2241 petition under the savings clause of \u00a7 2255. <em>See Christopher, </em>342 F.3d at 382; <em>Reyes-Requena, </em>243 F.3d at 903-04. Accordingly, she has not shown that the district court erred in determining that she was not entitled to proceed under the \u00a7 2255 savings clause. The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b306-30\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
