We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review the denial of a motion to suppress de novo. <em>See United States v. Jones, </em>286 F.3d 1146, 1150 (9th Cir.2002). We deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-23\">The BIA did not err in denying the motion to suppress. The exclusionary rule does not generally apply in immigration proceedings. <em>See INS v. Lopez-Mendoza, </em>468 U.S. 1032, 1050-51, 104 S.Ct. 3479, 82 L.Ed.2d 778 (1984). We have held, however, that it does bar the introduction of evidence obtained through \u201cegregious violations\u201d of the Fourth Amendment. <em>See Orhorhaghe v. INS, </em>38 F.3d 488, 493 (9th Cir.1994). An officer acts egregiously when he \u201ccommitt[s] the violation deliberately or by conduct a reasonable officer should have known would violate the Constitution.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Quintero-Huerta does not contend that the officers here deliberately violated his Fourth Amendment rights. Nor should a reasonable officer have known that the Anacortes checkpoint was unconstitutional. <em>See United States v. Martinez-Fuerte, </em>428 U.S. 543, 96 S.Ct. 3074, 49 L.Ed.2d 1116 (1976). Thus, even if there was a violation, an issue we do not decide, the motion was properly denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-24\">The record does not support QuinteroHuerta\u2019s contention that the government violated either 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 287.8(b)(1) or INA \u00a7 287(a)(2). Furthermore, QuinteroHuerta admitted his unlawful presence pri- or to his arrest. <em>United States v. Calderon-Medina, </em>591 F.2d 529, 531 (9th Cir.1979) (A violation of an INS regulation invalidates a deportation proceeding only if \u201cthe regulation serves a purpose of benefit to the alien\u201d and \u201cthe violation prejudiced <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>interests of the alien which were protected by the regulation.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b644-4\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b643-25\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
