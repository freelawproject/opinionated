We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence factual findings, and we review de novo the agency\u2019s legal determinations. <em>Wakkary v. Holder, </em>558 F.3d 1049, 1056 (9th Cir.2009). We deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-21\">Substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s determination that Chanthabandith\u2019s past experiences in Laos, including threatening visits from government forces, did not rise to the level of persecution. <em>See Hoxha v. Ashcroft, </em>319 F.3d 1179, 1181-82 (9th Cir.2003). Substantial evidence also supports the agency\u2019s determination that Chanthabandith failed to demonstrate a well-founded fear of future persecution, particularly in light of the lack of any visits by government forces after she bribed them. <em>See Castillo v. INS, </em>951 F.2d 1117, 1121-22 (9th Cir.1991). Chanthabandith\u2019s claim for humanitarian asylum necessarily fails because she did not establish past persecution. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.13(b)(l)(iii).</p>\n<p id=\"b611-22\">Because Chanthabandith failed to establish eligibility for asylum, she neces<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>sarily cannot meet the more stringent standard for withholding of removal. <em>See Zehatye v. Gonzales, </em>453 F.3d 1182, 1190 (9th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b612-4\">Finally, substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s denial of CAT relief because Chanthabandith did not demonstrate a clear probability of torture. <em>See Wakkary, </em>558 F.3d at 1067-68.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-5\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b611-16\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
