Lunsford appeals his conviction and seventy-seven month sentence pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 922(g)(1), 924(a)(2) (2006). On appeal, Lunsford argues first that \u00a7 922(g)(1) is unconstitutional because it violates the Second Amendment and because he has an \u201cinability to retreat\u201d due to medical conditions. Lunsford next argues that his sentence is proeedurally unreasonable, asserting that the Guidelines enhancement for possessing a stolen firearm, USSG \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(4), is invalid because it does not contain a mens rea requirement. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-10\">In <em>United States v. Moore, </em>666 F.3d 313, 316-17 (4th Cir.2012), we held that \u201c \u00a7 922(g)(1) [is] a constitutionally valid statute.\u201d While we left open the possibility of a successful as-applied challenge, we noted that the <em>Moore </em>defendant did not fall within the category of \u201claw-abiding responsible\u201d citizens that the Second Amendment protects. <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>District of Columbia v. Heller, </em>554 U.S. 570, 635, 128 S.Ct. 2783, 171 L.Ed.2d 637 (2008)). Similarly, Lunsford has a record of felony convictions for uttering, grand theft of a motor vehicle, and delivery of hydrocodone. Like the defendant in <em>Moore, </em>and notwithstanding his limited mobility and any difficulty he may have in defending himself, Lunsford\u2019s criminal history places him outside of the category of non-violent, law-abiding citizens protected by the Second Amendment. <em>See United States v. Torres-Rosario, </em>658 F.3d 110, 113 (1st Cir.2011). Lunsford\u2019s constitutional challenge to \u00a7 922(g)(1) therefore fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-12\">Lunsford next challenges the procedural reasonableness of his sentence, arguing that the enhancement applied by the district court is invalid. This court reviews a sentence for reasonableness \u201cunder a deferential abuse-of-discretion standard.\u201d <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 41, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). In determining procedural reasonableness, this court considers, inter alia, whether the district court properly calculated the defendant\u2019s Guidelines range. <em>Id. </em>at 49-51, 128 S.Ct. 586. Lunsford\u2019s sentencing challenge fails because it was expressly rejected in <em>United States v. Taylor, </em>659 F.3d 339, 343 (4th Cir.2011) (\u201cTaylor asks that we invalidate [USSG \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(4)(A) ] on the grounds that its lack of a mens rea requirement renders it inconsistent with federal law. This we cannot do.\u201d). Lunsford\u2019s sentence is therefore not procedurally unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-13\">Accordingly, we affirm Lunsford\u2019s conviction and sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-14\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
