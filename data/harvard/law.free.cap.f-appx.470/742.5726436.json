No reversible error has been shown; we affirm.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b771-10\">During McIntosh\u2019s original sentencing proceeding, a probation officer calculated McIntosh\u2019s total offense level as 38 \u2014 pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c)(3) and (b)(1) \u2014 based on McIntosh\u2019s possession of 1 kilogram of cocaine base and his possession of a dangerous weapon. The probation officer then concluded that McIntosh qualified as a career offender and that his resulting offense level under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4Bl.l(b) was 37. Because McIntosh\u2019s offense level under section 4B1.1 was- not \u201cgreater than the offense level otherwise applicable,\u201d McIntosh\u2019s total offense level remained 38. McIntosh then received a criminal history category of VI under section 4Bl.l(b) because of his career offender designation. McIntosh\u2019s guidelines range was calculated as 360 months\u2019 to life imprisonment; and the district court sentenced McIntosh to 360 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-14\">When a sentencing guideline is amended and given retroactive effect, the district court may reduce an already incarcerated defendant\u2019s term of imprisonment under the amendment \u201cif such a reduction is consistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2); <em>see also </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(a)(1). A reduction of a term of imprisonment is not \u201cconsistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission\u201d \u2014 and is, therefore, unauthorized under section 3582(c)(2) \u2014 if the retroactive amendment \u201cdoes not have the effect of lowering the defendant\u2019s applicable guideline range.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(2)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b771-15\">Applying Amendment 706 retroactively to McIntosh\u2019s case, his total adjusted offense level under section 2D1.1 would become 36 instead of 38. This includes a base offense level of 34 because he was held responsible for 1 kilogram of cocaine base and a 2-level enhancement for possession of a dangerous weapon. Because McIntosh\u2019s career offender offense level of 37 is now higher than the modified offense level of 36, his total offense level becomes 37 under section 4Bl.l(b). <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4Bl.l(b) (providing that \u201cif the offense <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"744\">*744</page-number>level for a career offender ... is greater than the offense level otherwise applicable, the [career offender] offense level ... shall apply\u201d)- Based on an offense level of 37 and a criminal history category of VI, McIntosh\u2019s guidelines range is still 360 months\u2019 to life imprisonment. Because the application of Amendment 706 did not lower McIntosh\u2019s applicable guidelines range, he is ineligible for relief under section 3582(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b772-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b771-11\">.
