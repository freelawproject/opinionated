We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review de novo questions of law and for substantial evidence factual findings, <em>Husyev v. Mukasey, </em>528 F.3d 1172, 1177 (9th Cir.2008), applying the new standards governing adverse credibility determinations created by the REAL ID Act, <em>Shrestha v. Holder, </em>590 F.3d 1034, 1039 (9th Cir.2010). We deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-23\">The record does not compel the conclusion that Cifuentes-Hernandez established changed or extraordinary circumstances excusing his untimely asylum application. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.4(a)(4), (5). Accordingly, we deny the petition as to his asylum claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-24\">Substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s adverse credibility finding based both on the omission from Cifuentes-Hernandez\u2019s asylum application of his brother\u2019s death and on inconsistencies between his application, his sworn statement, and his testimony regarding the basis for his claim. <em>See Shrestha, </em>590 F.3d at 1048 (adverse credibility finding reasonable under totality of circumstances). Further, the agency was not compelled to accept his explanations. <em>See Zamanov v. Holder, </em>649 F.3d 969, 974 (9th Cir.2011). Accordingly, in the absence of credible testimony, his withholding of removal claim fails. <em>See Farah v. Ashcroft, </em>348 F.3d 1153, 1156 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b645-25\">In addition, Cifuentes-Hernandez\u2019s CAT claim fails because it is based on the same statements the agency found not credible, and the record does not otherwise compel a finding it is more likely than not he would be tortured if returned to Guatemala. <em>See id. </em>at 1156-57.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>Finally, Cifuentes-Hernandez\u2019s due process claims are belied by the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-4\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b645-26\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
