Diehl filed an amended complaint against BOA in 2010 alleging violations of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA), the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), and the Family Medical Leave Act (FMLA). For the following reasons we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-15\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-16\">Diehl was a Senior Vice President at BOA and had worked at the bank for 34 years. She was diagnosed with breast cancer in July 2008 and took FMLA leave from September 15, 2008 to November 10, 2008 to seek treatment. Shortly after her return, BOA restructured her position and removed her management responsibilities. In early February 2009 Diehl was terminated as part of a reduction in force (RIF). She was 55 years old at that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-17\">Diehl\u2019s manager was Ann McCormick, who had been in that position since the end of 2007. McCormick\u2019s boss, Kevin Phalen, joined BOA in June 2008. Phalen\u2019s boss was William \u201cDub\u201d Newman.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-18\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-19\">When Phalen arrived at BOA he immediately started looking for ways to streamline the bank\u2019s management structure. He spoke with McCormick about consoli<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"773\">*773</page-number>dating the responsibilities of Diehl with one of her peers, Marybeth Worsham. The women had similar responsibilities and managed an equal number of people at BOA, with Diehl working on the bank\u2019s private credit/debit card business and Worsham responsible for BOA\u2019s government credit/debit card business. At some point in late summer or early fall of 2008, McCormick and Phalen decided to transfer Diehl\u2019s credit card responsibilities and subordinates to Worsham. They informed Worsham in October or November 2008.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-5\">Diehl was informed of this decision in December 2008, approximately one month after she returned from FMLA leave. When McCormick informed Diehl about the decision she said to Diehl, \u201cSo that should take the stress off you.\u201d BOA claims it chose Worsham over Diehl because Worsham was a better manager, had more knowledge and experience with BOA\u2019s credit card system, and had experience, with Diehl\u2019s private credit card responsibilities, whereas Diehl had no experience with Worsham\u2019s government credit card responsibilities.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-6\">After the restructuring, Diehl\u2019s title, salary and benefits remained the same and she continued working on a project known as the LaSalle transition.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-7\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-8\">Rumors about layoffs at BOA began circulating when Diehl returned from leave in November 2008. The topic of layoffs was discussed during a November 13, 2008 meeting that McCormick had with her subordinates, which included Diehl and Worsham. McCormick stated that her supervisor, Phalen, had not been notified of any layoffs. Worsham responded that she did not have enough years of service with BOA to retire. During that conversation, McCormick stated, \u201cWe have our old-timer, Linda [Diehl], who has 30-some years; right Linda?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b801-10\">In late December 2008, Newman learned that BOA wanted a ten percent RIF in effect by early 2009. He informed Phalen in January 2009 of the planned layoffs, and Phalen subsequently told his subordinates, including McCormick, to begin selecting employees for termination.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-11\">Diehl was selected to be terminated, but there is some confusion with regard to who made that decision. In her deposition, McCormick stated that Phalen told her Diehl would be let go. Phalen says that McCormick recommended Diehl for termination. Newman initially stated that he was \u201c[n]ot personally\u201d involved in the decision to terminate Diehl. But after his deposition Newman filed an errata that stated that he had reviewed his email from January 2009 and discovered that he had suggested Diehl to Phalen as someone to consider for termination.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-12\">In late January 2009, McCormick was told that Diehl would be a victim of the RIF. She informed Diehl on February 3, 2009.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-13\">BOA did not replace Diehl with anyone because the bank completely eliminated her position after the layoffs. Her remaining duties were distributed to other BOA employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-14\">Despite the absence of any evidence in the record, Diehl believes that her BOA supervisors knew about the RIF before they decided to restructure her job and used the restructuring decision to justify their-decision to terminate her.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-15\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-16\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-17\">\u201cThe ADEA makes it \u2018unlawful for an employer to fail or refuse to hire or to discharge any individual or otherwise dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"774\">*774</page-number>criminate against any individual with respect to his compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment, because of such individual\u2019s age.\u2019 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 623(a)(1).\u201d <em>Chapman v. AI Transp., </em>229 F.3d 1012, 1024 (11th Cir.2000). \u201cWhen a plaintiff alleges disparate treatment, liability depends on whether the protected trait (under the ADEA, age) actually motivated the employer\u2019s decision.\u201d <em>Reeves v. Sanderson Plumbing Products, Inc., </em>530 U.S. 133, 141, 120 S.Ct. 2097, 147 L.Ed.2d 105 (2000) (quotations and citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b802-4\">The <em>McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, </em>411 U.S. 792, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 36 L.Ed.2d 668 (1973), burden shifting analysis is applied to determine if there was age discrimination, when the claim is based on circumstantial evidence. <em>Chapman, </em>229 F.3d at 1024. Under this framework, the plaintiff must establish a <em>prima facie </em>case of discrimination by (1) showing she is a member of the protected class, (2) she suffered an adverse employment action, (3) she was qualified to do the job, and (4) was replaced by or lost a position to a younger person. <em>Id. </em>Once the plaintiff establishes a <em>prima facie </em>case, \u201cthe defendant employer must articulate a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for the challenged employment action. However, the employer\u2019s burden is merely one of production; it need not persuade the court that it was actually motivated by the proffered reasons.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotations and citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b802-5\">If the employer provides a nondiscriminatory reason, \u201cthe presumption of discrimination is eliminated\u201d and the plaintiff must put forth evidence \u201csufficient to permit a reasonable fact finder to conclude that the reasons given by the employer were not the real reasons for the adverse employment decision.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotations and citations omitted). \u201cIf the plaintiff does not proffer sufficient evidence to create a genuine issue of material fact regarding whether each of the defendant employer\u2019s articulated reasons is pretextual, the employer is entitled to summary judgment on the plaintiffs claim.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b802-7\">i.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-8\">BOA argues that Diehl\u2019s job restructure was not an adverse employment action. BOA states her title, pay and benefits remained the same even though she was no longer supervising two subordinates. Diehl states that she and her coworkers considered the move a demotion.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-9\">An adverse employment action is \u201ca significant change in employment status, such as hiring, firing, failing to promote, reassignment with significantly different responsibilities, or a decision causing a significant change in benefits.\u201d <em>Burlington Indus., Inc., v. Ellerth, </em>524 U.S. 742, 761, 118 S.Ct. 2257, 141 L.Ed.2d 633 (1998). Since the restructure meant that Diehl would not manage any subordinates it should be considered a \u201creassignment with significantly different responsibilities,\u201d especially since Diehl\u2019s new role with BOA was eventually considered expendable and eliminated.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-10\">But Diehl cannot prove the restructure was done because of her age. BOA wanted to streamline its processes under one manager instead of two. BOA states it selected Worsham because she knew the credit card processing system better than Diehl, had experience with Diehl\u2019s responsibilities but Diehl had no experience with Worsham\u2019s responsibilities, and Worsham was managing her division better than Diehl.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-11\">Diehl counters that these reasons are pretextual because of some comments from her supervisor. McCormick called Diehl an \u201cold-timer.\u201d But as the district court held, \u201cthis statement was made in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"775\">*775</page-number>the context of comparing years of service between employees,\u201d and is not evidence of discriminatory intent. The statement was made after the restructure decision was made and announced to Worsham, which makes it irrelevant to this claim. \u201cRemarks such as this one-isolated and unrelated to the challenged employment decision-are not direct evidence of discrimination.\u201d <em>Rojas v. Florida, </em>285 F.3d 1339, 1342-43 (11th Cir.2002). Accordingly, Diehl\u2019s ADEA claim for the restructuring decision fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-5\">ii.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-6\">BOA argues that Diehl cannot establish her <em>prima facie </em>case because her position was eliminated after her termination as a part of its RIF, making it impossible for Diehl to be replaced by a younger person. Diehl counters that the \u201cold timer\u201d remark, BOA\u2019s inability to reveal who made the decision to terminate her and that BOA \u201cessentially \u2018hired,\u2019 or at least selected\u201d Worsham \u2014 who is 16 years younger than Diehl \u2014 rather than Diehl for the remaining management position is evidence of discrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-7\">We have generally \u201ceschewed an overly strict formulation of the elements of a <em>prima facie </em>case, particularly in age discrimination cases.\u201d <em>Jameson v. Arrow Co., </em>75 F.3d 1528, 1531 (11th Cir.1996).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b803-8\">A plaintiff may establish a <em>prima facie </em>case of age discrimination in a reduction-in-force case by (1) demonstrating that he was in a protected age group and was adversely affected by an employment decision; (2) showing he was qualified for his former position or another position at the time he was adversely affected; and (3) producing circumstantial or direct evidence from which a reasonable factfinder could conclude that his employer intended to discriminate on the basis of age in reaching the decision at issue.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b803-11\"><em>Maddow v. Procter &amp; Gamble Co., </em>107 F.3d 846, 851 (11th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b803-12\">But even if we accept that Diehl has established her <em>prima facie </em>case from the transfer of her responsibilities to Worsham, Diehl cannot prove she is the victim of age discrimination. The only evidence of discrimination she has is the \u201cold timer\u201d comment, which in context refers to her tenure at BOA and not her age, and BOA\u2019s inability to specify who made the decision to terminate her. As the district court stated, \u201cwhoever made the termination decision, [BOA] has put forward a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for the action it took,\u201d <em>ie., </em>the ten percent reduction in force. Without more, Diehl\u2019s age discrimination claim fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-13\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-14\">Under the ADA, an employer cannot discriminate against \u201ca qualified individual on the basis of disability in regard to job application procedures, the hiring, advancement, or discharge of employees, employee compensation, job training, and other terms, conditions, and privileges of employment.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12112(a). ADA claims are also analyzed under the <em>McDonnell Douglas </em>format. <em>Holly v. Clairson Indus., L.L.C., </em>492 F.3d 1247, 1255 (11th Cir.2007). A plaintiff establishes a <em>prima facie </em>case by establishing (1) she was disabled, (2) she was qualified for her job and (3) suffered an adverse action because of her disability. <em>Id. </em>at 1255-56.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-15\">BOA does not dispute Diehl was disabled but states that she cannot prove causation. As the district court held, \u201cthere is no evidence in the record from which a reasonable factfinder could conclude that ... her termination [was] a pretext for disability discrimination.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"776\">*776</page-number>Diehl argues that her lower performance evaluation, which occurred after she was diagnosed with cancer, is evidence of causation. But this merely proves that the two events coincided, not that they were causally related. Diehl also cites McCormick\u2019s comment about Diehl\u2019s stress level when she told her about the restructure decision as evidence of discrimination. However, this comment concerned the restructure decision, an ADA claim Diehl has abandoned on appeal, not the termination decision. Accordingly, her ADA claim fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-4\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-5\">The FMLA grants employees \u201c12 workweeks of leave during any 12-month period ... [b]ecause of a serious health condition that makes the employee unable to perform the functions of the position of such employee,\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 2612(a)(1), and afterwards the employee must \u201cbe restored by the employer to the position of employment held by the employee when the leave commenced\u201d or to an equivalent position. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 2614(a)(1). The FMLA has two types of claims to enforce these rights: \u201cinterference claims, in which an employee asserts that his employer denied or otherwise interfered with his substantive rights under the Act, <em>see </em>29 U.S.C. \u00a7 2615(a)(1), and retaliation claims, in which an employee asserts that his employer discriminated against him because he engaged in activity protected by the Act, <em>see </em>29 U.S.C. \u00a7 2615(a)(1) &amp; (2); 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 825.220(c) (\u2018An employer is prohibited from discriminating against employees ... who have used FMLA leave.\u2019).\u201d <em>Strickland v. Water Works &amp; Sewer Bd., </em>239 F.3d 1199, 1206 (11th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b804-7\">To establish a retaliation claim, \u201can employee must demonstrate that his employer intentionally discriminated against him in the form of an adverse employment action for having exercised an FMLA right.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1207 (citation omitted). \u201cIn other words, a plaintiff bringing a retaliation claim faces the increased burden of showing that his employer\u2019s actions were motivated by an impermissible retaliatory or discriminatory animus.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b804-9\">FMLA claims are also analyzed under the <em>McDonnell Douglas </em>format. <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted). The employee\u2019s <em>prima facie </em>case is made by showing: \u201c(1) he engaged in a statutorily protected activity; (2) he suffered an adverse employment decision; and (3) the decision was causally related to the protected activity.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b804-10\">The district court is correct that Diehl did not prove causation. Diehl cites McCormick\u2019s comment that her new restructured role at BOA should relieve her stress level, the timing of the job restructuring and termination decisions and the reference to Diehl\u2019s leave of absence on her performance review as evidence that BOA retaliated against her for taking FMLA leave. The district court correctly found that the stress comment \u201c[a]t most, [ ] evidences a concern for Diehl\u2019s well-being, not any animus from Diehl\u2019s exercise of her FMLA rights.\u201d Diehl has shown the decisions to restructure and terminate her position coincide with her FMLA leave but not that they were caused by her FMLA leave. As the district court held: \u201c[T]he reference to Diehl\u2019s leave in her review is not a negative reference, but is rather an explanatory reference. McCormick was merely seeking to explain why Diehl was not able to meet all of her goals for the review period.\u201d Since Diehl is unable to prove causation, her FMLA claim fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
