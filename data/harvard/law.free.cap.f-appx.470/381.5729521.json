He challenges the supervised release term of 58 months and 29 days, arguing that the supervised release term was greater than necessary for purposes of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) and that the district court failed to articulate why the term would satisfy the goals- of \u00a7 3553(a). Stephens argues that the \u201cunusually long\u201d supervised release term was unreasonable because he had lost his job, there was death in his family, and his home was partially burned in a fire.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-22\">Revocation sentences generally are reviewed under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(a)\u2019s \u201cplainly unreasonable\u201d standard. <em>United States v. Miller, </em>634 F.3d 841, 843 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 132 S.Ct. 496, 181 L.Ed.2d 345 (2011). Because Stephens did not argue in the district court that the supervised release term was greater than necessary for purposes of \u00a7 3553(a) and that the district court failed to justify the length of the term in reference to \u00a7 3553(a), review is for plain error. <em>See United States v. Jackson, </em>559 F.3d 368, 372 (5th Cir.2009); <em>United States v. Whitelaw, </em>580 F.3d 256, 259-60 (5th Cir.2009). Under the plain error standard, Stephens must show a clear or obvious error that affected his substantial rights. <em>See Puckett v. United States, </em>556 U.S. 129, 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009). This court has discretion to correct the error but only if it seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of the proceedings. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b409-25\">At the revocation hearing, the district court considered testimony regarding Stephens\u2019s job loss, the death in the family, and the fire, but it determined that the near 54-month term of supervised release was appropriate. Although the district court did not expressly cite \u00a7 3553(a) in imposing the revocation sentence, the court considered at length the nature and circumstances of Stephens\u2019s supervised release violations and his history and characteristics. <em>See </em>\u00a7 3553(a)(1); <em>Whitelaw, </em>580 F.3d at 262-65; <em>United States v. Gonzalez, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>250 F.3d 923, 930 (5th Cir.2001). Stephens has not shown that the district court plainly erred in imposing the supervised release term. <em>See Jackson, </em>559 F.3d at 372; <em>Whitelaw, </em>580 F.3d at 259-60.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b409-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
