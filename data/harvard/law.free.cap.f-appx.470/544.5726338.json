We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence the agency\u2019s factual findings, applying the new standards governing adverse credibility determinations created by the Real ID Act. <em>Shrestha v. Holder, </em>590 F.3d 1034, 1039-40 (9th Cir.2010). We deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-5\">Substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s adverse credibility determination based on the implausibility of Kumar\u2019s testimony that he was unaware of problems in Punjab between the police and members of the Akali Dal Mann political party. <em>See Chebchoub v. INS, </em>257 F.3d 1038, 1044 (9th Cir.2001). The record also lacks corroboration for Kumar\u2019s claim that the Akali Dal Mann party and police are linked and his claim that Akali Dal Mann party members, and members of the Hindu group Shiv Sena, target members of Kumar\u2019s Nirankari faith. <em>See Aden v. Holder, </em>589 F.3d 1040, 1044-45 (9th Cir.2009); <em>Sidhu v. INS, </em>220 F.3d 1085, 1090 (9th Cir.2000) (\u201c[I]f the trier of fact either does not believe the applicant or does not know what to believe, the applicant\u2019s failure to corroborate his testimony can be fatal to his asylum application.\u201d). Accordingly, Ku mar\u2019s asylum and withholding of removal claims fail. <em>See Farah v. Ashcroft, </em>348 F.3d 1153, 1156 (9th Cir.2003). In light of our conclusions regarding Kumar\u2019s lack of credibility, Kumar\u2019s humanitarian asylum claim necessarily fails. <em>See Wang v. BIA, </em>437 F.3d 270, 275-76 (2d Cir.2006) (remand would be futile when the reviewing court can confidently predict the outcome).</p>\n<p id=\"b573-6\">Because Kumar\u2019s CAT claim is based on the same evidence the agency found not credible and uncorroborated, and he points to no other evidence showing it is more likely than not he will be tortured if returned to India, his CAT claim also fails. <em>See Farah, </em>348 F.3d at 1156-57; <em>see also Aden, </em>589 F.3d at 1047.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-10\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b572-29\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
