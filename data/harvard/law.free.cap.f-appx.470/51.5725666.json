June 30, 2011), <em>affg </em>No. A088 006 199 (Immig. Ct. Hartford Mar. 10, 2010). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-6\">Under the circumstances of this case, we have reviewed the IJ\u2019s decision as supplemented by the BIA. <em>See Yan Chen v. Gonzales, </em>417 F.3d 268, 271 (2d Cir.2005). The applicable standards of review are well established. <em>See 8 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>see also Yanqin Weng v. Holder, </em>562 F.3d 510, 513 (2d Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b80-7\">Alvarez challenges the agency\u2019s denial of his application for withholding of removal. However, the agency reasonably found that the harm Alvarez personally suffered \u2014 a warning letter from the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (\u201cFARC\u201d) over a land dispute and a general threat not to report the kidnaping of his brother \u2014 was, when considered in the aggregate, insufficiently severe to constitute persecution. <em>See Ivanishvili v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>433 F.3d 332, 341-42 (2d Cir. 2006); <em>Gui Ci Pan v. U.S. Attorney Gen., </em>449 F.3d 408, 412 (2d Cir.2006) (per curiam). As the agency reasonably concluded that Alvarez did not suffer past persecution, he is not entitled to a presumption of future persecution. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.16(b)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b80-8\">To the extent Alvarez argues that he established a clear probability of future persecution independent from his claim of past persecution, he has not identified any record evidence or testimony to support this position. <em>See Jian Xing Huang v. INS, </em>421 F.3d 125, 129 (2d Cir.2005) (a fear is speculative and not objectively reasonable if it lacks \u201csolid support in the record\u201d). As the agency reasonably determined that Alvarez failed to demonstrate that he suffered past persecution or established a clear probability of future persecution, the agency did not err in denying his application for withholding of removal. <em>See Ivanishvili, </em>433 F.3d at 341; <em>Gui Ci Pan v. U.S. Attorney Gen., </em>449 F.3d at 412.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-9\">Alvarez also argues that the IJ did not enter an explicit credibility finding in his decision. While Alvarez is correct, the IJ\u2019s oversight was harmless because his decision implicitly credited Alvarez\u2019s testimony and denied Alvarez\u2019s claim on the merits. <em>See, e.g., Ajdin v. Bureau of Citizenship and Immigration Services, </em>437 F.3d 261, 266 (2d Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b80-10\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. As we have completed our review, any stay of removal that the Court previously granted in this petition is VACATED, and any pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot. Any pending request for oral argument in this petition is DENIED in accordance with Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 34(a)(2), and Second Circuit Local Rule 34.1(b).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
