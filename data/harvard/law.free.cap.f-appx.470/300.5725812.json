Paxson also moves for the appointment of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-7\">Paxson argues that the district court erred in dismissing his petition because (1) he would otherwise be denied the opportunity to \u201ctest the legality of his conviction\u201d and to prove that he was actually innocent, and (2) his petition falls within the savings clause of 28 U.S.C. 2255(e) based on the holding in <em>Pack v. Yusuff, </em>218 F.3d 448 (5th Cir.2000). Paxson also asserts that the district court should have applied 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1651, the All Writs Act, to transfer his petition to the appellate court with the appropriate jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-8\">We review a district court\u2019s dismissal of a \u00a7 2241 petition de novo. <em>Kinder v. Purdy, </em>222 F.3d 209, 212 (5th Cir.2000). \u201cA section 2241 petition that seeks to challenge the validity of a federal sentence must either be dismissed or construed as a section 2255 motion.\u201d <em>Pack, </em>218 F.3d at 452. A \u00a7 2241 petition that attacks custody resulting from a federally imposed sentence may be entertained under the savings clause of \u00a7 2255 if the petitioner establishes that the remedy provided under \u00a7 2255 is \u201cinadequate or ineffective\u201d to test the legality of his detention. <em>Tolliver v. Dobre, </em>211 F.3d 876, 878 (5th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b329-9\">To demonstrate that the remedy provided under \u00a7 2255 is inadequate or ineffective, Paxson must establish that his claim is \u201c(i) ... based on a retroactively applicable Supreme Court decision which establishes that [he] ... may have been convicted of a nonexistent offense and (ii) that was foreclosed by circuit law at the time when the claim should have been raised in [his] ... trial, appeal, or first \u00a7 2255 motion.\u201d <em>Reyes-Requena v. United States, </em>243 F.3d 893, 904 (5th Cir.2001). The first \u201cfactor requires that a retroactively applicable Supreme Court decision establish that the petitioner is actually innocent,\u201d meaning that he \u201cmay have been imprisoned for conduct that was not prohibited by law.\u201d <em>Jeffers v. Chandler, </em>253 F.3d 827, 830-31 (5th Cir.2001) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Paxson\u2019s assertions that his indictment, plea agreement, and guilty plea were invalid do not meet this standard because the claims do not rely on a retroactively applicable Supreme Court decision showing that he was convicted of a nonexistent offense. <em>See Padilla v. United States, </em>416 F.3d 424, 427 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b329-14\">Paxson\u2019s assertion that the district court should have transferred his petition pursuant to \u00a7 1651 is equally unavailing. Construing Paxson\u2019s petition as a \u00a7 2255 motion and transferring it to a court with proper jurisdiction rather than dismissing the petition would not have served the best interests of justice given that Paxson had previously filed \u00a7 2255 motions and would have been required to seek permission before filing a successive motion. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1631. Accordingly, the district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED. Furthermore, because Paxson has not \u201cdemonstrated that the interests of justice would be served by the appointment of counsel,\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>his motion is DENIED. <em>United States v. Tubwell, </em>37 F.3d 175, 179 (5th Cir.1994).</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b329-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
