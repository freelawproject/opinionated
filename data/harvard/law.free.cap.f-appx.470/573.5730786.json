We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence factual findings, including adverse credibility determinations. <em>Chebchoub v. INS, </em>257 F.3d 1038, 1042 (9th Cir.2001). We deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-24\">Substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s adverse credibility determination because Ocampo-Manguia omitted the fact that he was kidnapped and beaten by guerillas from his first asylum application and from his interview with an asylum officer, <em>see Zamanov v. Holder, </em>649 F.3d 969, 973 (9th Cir.2011) (\u201cMaterial alterations in the applicant\u2019s account of persecution are sufficient to support an adverse <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>credibility finding.\u201d), and the agency reasonably rejected Ocampo-Manguia\u2019s explanation for the omission, <em>see Rivera v. Mukasey, </em>508 F.3d 1271, 1275 (9th Cir.2007). In the absence of credible testimony, Ocampo-Manguia\u2019s asylum and withholding of removal claims fail. <em>See Farah v. Ashcroft, </em>348 F.3d 1153, 1156 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b603-5\">\u2022 [2] Because Ocampo-Manguia\u2019s CAT claim is based on the same testimony the agency found not credible, and he points to no other evidence showing it is more likely than not he will be tortured if returned to Guatemala, his CAT claim also fails. <em>See id. </em>at'1156-57.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-6\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b602-25\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
