On appeal, Kalishek first argues that the administrative law judge (\u201cALJ\u201d) did not make detailed findings or seriously discuss whether his impairment met Listing 1.02A, regarding major dysfunction of a joint or joints, in the Listing of Impairments (\u201cListings\u201d). He contends that he was not able to effectively ambulate, as required by Listing 1.02A. He argues that his position was supported by the medical evidence, including an opinion from his treating physician that was submitted to the Appeals Council after the ALJ had issued his decision. Secondly, Kalishek argues that the ALJ erred in finding him not credible because his testimony and statements as to the intensity, persistence, and limiting effects of his pain were not inconsistent.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-9\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-10\">We review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s decision as to whether substantial evidence supports the ALJ\u2019s decision. <em>Wilson v. Barnhart, </em>284 F.3d 1219, 1221 (11th Cir.2002). \u201cSubstantial evidence is more than a scintilla and is such relevant evidence as a reasonable person would accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u201d <em>Crawford v. Comm\u2019r of Soc. Sec., </em>363 F.3d 1155, 1158 (11th Cir.2004) (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b897-12\">Normally, we review the decision of the ALJ as the Commissioner\u2019s final decision when the ALJ denies benefits and the Appeals Council denies review of the ALJ\u2019s decision. <em>Id. </em>However, \u201cwhen a claimant properly presents new evidence to the Appeals Council, a reviewing court must consider whether that new evidence renders the denial of benefits erroneous.\u201d <em>Ingram v. Comm\u2019r of Soc. Sec., </em>496 F.3d 1253, 1262, 1266 (11th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b897-13\">A person is disabled under the Social Security Act if they have the \u201cinability to engage in any substantial gainful activity by reason of any medically determinable physical or mental impairment which can be expected to result in death or which has lasted or is expected to last for a continuous period of not less than 12 months.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 423(d)(1)(A). The agency uses a five-step sequential evaluation process when determining whether a claimant is disabled. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1520. First, if the claimant is performing substantial gainful activity, the claimant is not disabled. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 404.1520(a)(4)(i). If not, then the Commissioner considers the medical severity of the claimant\u2019s impairments at the second step. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 404.1520(a)(4)(ii). At the third step, if the Commissioner determines that the claimant\u2019s impairment or combination of impairments meets or equals a listed impairment, then the claimant is considered disabled, regardless of the claimant\u2019s age, education, or work experience. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 404.1520(a)(4)(iii), (d). If not, at the fourth step, the Commissioner considers the claimant\u2019s residual functional capacity and ability to perform past relevant work. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 404.1520(a)(4)(iv). If the claimant cannot perform any past relevant work, the Commissioner then determines, at the fifth step, whether the claimant, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"870\">*870</page-number>based on their residual functional capacity, age, education, and work experience, can make an adjustment to other work. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 404.1520(a)(4)(v). If the Commissioner finds that the claimant can make such an adjustment, then the Commissioner will find that the claimant is not disabled. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b898-4\">The claimant has the burden of proving that an impairment meets or equals a listed impairment. <em>Barron v. Sullivan, </em>924 F.2d 227, 229 (11th Cir.1991). To \u201cmeet\u201d a Listing, a claimant must have a diagnosis included in the Listings and must provide medical reports documenting that the conditions meet the specific criteria of the Listings and the duration requirement. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1525(a)-(d); <em>Wilson, </em>284 F.3d at 1224. To \u201cmedically equal\u201d a Listing, the medical findings must be \u201cat least equal in severity and duration to the criteria of any listed impairment.\u201d 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1526(a); <em>Wilson, </em>284 F.3d at 1224. If a claimant has more than one impairment, and none meets or equals a listed impairment, the Commissioner reviews the impairments\u2019 symptoms, signs, and laboratory findings to determine whether the combination is medically equal to the criteria of any listed impairment. <em>Id. </em>An impairment that meets only some of the criteria of a Listing, no matter how severely, does not qualify. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.925(c)(3). The ALJ\u2019s finding as to whether a claimant meets a listed impairment may be implied from the record. <em>Hutchison v. Bowen, </em>787 F.2d 1461, 1463 (11th Cir.1986). Furthermore, while the ALJ must consider the Listings in making its disability determination, \u201cit is not required that the [ALJ] mechanically recite the evidence leading to [its] determination.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b898-5\">Listing 1.02A defines major dysfunction of a joint or joints as being characterized by: (1) \u201cgross anatomical deformity,\u201d which includes subluxation (malpositioning of a bone), contracture, bony or fibrous anklyosis, or instability; (2) chronic joint pain and stiffness with signs of either limitation of motion or other abnormal motion of the affected joint or joints; (3) findings on \u201cappropriate medically acceptable imaging\u201d of either joint space narrowing, bony destruction, or anklyosis of the affected joint or joints; and (4) the involvement of one major peripheral weight-bearing joint, such as the knee, hip, or ankle, resulting in an inability to ambulate effectively, as defined in Listing 1.00B2b. 20 C.F.R. Pt. 404, Subpt. P, App\u2019x 1, \u00a7 1.02A. The inability to ambulate effectively is defined as \u201can extreme limitation of the ability to walk,\u201d or an impairment that \u201cinterferes very seriously with the individual\u2019s ability to independently initiate, sustain, or complete activities.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1.00B2b(l). The inability to ambulate effectively is also generally defined as having insufficient functioning of the lower extremities such that the claimant cannot independently ambulate without the use of a hand-held assistive device \u201cthat limits the functioning of both upper extremities.\u201d <em>Id. </em>To be able to ambulate effectively, claimants:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b898-8\">[M]ust be capable of sustaining a reasonable walking pace over a sufficient distance to be able to carry out activities of daily living. They must have the ability to travel without companion assistance to and from a place of employment or school. Therefore, examples of ineffective ambulation include, but are not limited to, the inability to walk without the use of a walker, two crutches or two canes, the inability to walk a block at a reasonable pace on rough or uneven surfaces, the inability to use standard public transportation, the inability to carry out routine ambulatory activities, such as shopping and banking, and the inability to climb a few steps at a reasonable pace with the use of a single hand rail. The ability to walk independently about <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"871\">*871</page-number>one\u2019s home without the use of assistive devices does not, in and of itself, constitute effective ambulation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b899-5\"><em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1.00B2b(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b899-6\">Normally, the opinion of a treating physician must be given substantial or considerable .weight unless \u201cgood cause\u201d is shown to the contrary. <em>Crawford, </em>363 F.3d at 1159. A treating physician\u2019s report may be discounted when it is not accompanied by objective medical evidence or is wholly conclusory. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b899-7\">Upon review of the record and consideration of the parties\u2019 briefs, we affirm. This record reflects that substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s conclusion that Kalishek did not meet Listing 1.02A because, in light of the medical evidence and Kalishek\u2019s own testimony, the ALJ reasonably could have concluded that Kalishek could effectively ambulate. Furthermore, the additional opinions submitted by Kalishek\u2019s treating physician after the ALJ had rendered its decision do not render the ALJ\u2019s findings erroneous because the opinions were wholly conclusory and unaccompanied by any objective medical evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-9\">When a claimant testifies to subjective complaints of pain, the ALJ must clearly articulate adequate reasons for discrediting the claimant\u2019s allegations of disabling symptoms. <em>Dyer v. Barnhart, </em>395 F.3d 1206, 1210 (11th Cir.2005). Failure to articulate the reasons for discrediting such testimony mandates that the testimony, as a matter of law, be accepted as true. <em>Cannon v. Bowen, </em>858 F.2d 1541, 1545 (11th Cir.1988). However, if the ALJ clearly articulates adequate reasons for its finding, and there is substantial supporting evidence in the record, we will not disturb the credibility finding on review. <em>Foote v. Chater, </em>67 F.3d 1553, 1562 (11th Cir.1995). An ALJ is allowed to consider a claimant\u2019s daily activities when determining whether a claimant\u2019s testimony regarding symptoms such as pain is not credible, as well as whether medication helped the claimant\u2019s condition. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1529(c)(3)(i), (iv). Furthermore, the ALJ may consider the claimant\u2019s demean- or and appearance at the hearing in evaluating credibility. <em>Macia v. Bowen, </em>829 F.2d 1009, 1011 (11th Cir.1987). The ALJ\u2019s consideration of the claimant\u2019s demeanor, however, must not be the sole consideration in making a credibility determination. <em>Norris v. Heckler, </em>760 F.2d 1154, 1158 (11th Cir.1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b899-11\">Because the ALJ clearly articulated reasons in support of its finding that Kalishek was not credible, and those reasons are supported by substantial evidence, we will not disturb the ALJ\u2019s credibility finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
