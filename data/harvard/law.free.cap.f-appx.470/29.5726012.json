Garvan Murtha, of the United States District Court for the District of Vermont, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b58-6\">SUMMARY ORDER</p>\n<p id=\"b58-7\">UPON DUE CONSIDERATION, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED, ADJUDGED, AND DECREED that the judgment of the district court be AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-8\">Plaintiff-Appellant Antonio Andreos, <em>pro se, </em>appeals from a judgment of the United States District Court <em>for </em>the Southern District of New York (Crotty, J.), granting summary judgment in favor of his former employer, Kraft Foods Global, Inc. (\u201cKraft\u201d), in his employment discrimination action brought pursuant to Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (\u201cTitle VII\u201d), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e <em>et seq., </em>and the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 621 <em>et seq. </em>We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts, the procedural history of the case, and the issues on appeal.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b58-9\">Andreos\u2019s principal contention on appeal is that the district court erred in granting Kraft\u2019s summary judgment motion on his race discrimination claim. We review orders granting summary judgment <em>de novo. Miller v. Wolpoff &amp; Abramson, L.L.P., </em>321 F.3d 292, 300 (2d Cir.2003). Summary judgment is appropriate upon a showing \u201cthat there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and that the movant is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(a). \u201cIn determining whether there are genuine issues of material fact, we are required to resolve all ambiguities and draw all permissible factual inferences in favor of the party against whom summary judgment is sought.\u201d <em>Terry v. Ashcroft, </em>336 F.3d 128, 137 (2d Cir.2003) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b58-13\">Having conducted an independent review of the record in light of these principles, we affirm the grant of Kraft\u2019s summary judgment motion for substantially the same reasons stated by the district court in its Order. Although we find Andreos met his initial burden of establishing a <em>prima facie </em>case of racial discrimination, the district court properly concluded that he failed to demonstrate that Kraft\u2019s proffered nondiscriminatory reason for his termination was pretextual. <em>See McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, </em>411 U.S. 792, 802-04, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 36 L.Ed.2d 668 (1973); <em>Ruiz v. Cnty. of Rockland, </em>609 F.3d 486, 492 (2d Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b58-14\">We have considered all of Appellant\u2019s remaining arguments and find them to be without merit. For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is hereby AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b58-11\">. We grant Kraft's motion to strike those portions of Andreos's \"Reply Appendix\u201d that were not filed in the district court. <em>See Int'l Bus. Machs. Corp. v. Edelstein, 526 </em>F.2d 37, 45 (2d Cir.1975); Fed. R.App. P. 10(a).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
