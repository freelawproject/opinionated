We review for abuse of discretion the denial of a motion <em>to reopen, </em>and we review de novo questions of law, <em>Iturribarria v. INS, </em>321 F.3d 889, 894 (9th Cir.2003). We deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-16\">The BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying Mussa\u2019s motion to reopen as untimely where the motion was filed over three years after the BIA\u2019s final decision, <em>see </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(2), and Mussa failed to present evidence of changed circumstances in Rwanda to qualify for an exception to the time limit, <em>see </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(3)(ii); <em>Malty v. Ashcroft, </em>381 F.3d 942, 945 (9th Cir.2004) (\u201cThe critical question is ... whether circumstances have changed sufficiently that a petitioner who previously did not have a legitimate claim for asylum now has a well-founded fear of future persecution.\u201d). Further, the BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying Mussa\u2019s motion to reopen based on ineffective assistance of counsel, because he failed to show that he was prejudiced by his former counsel\u2019s conduct. <em>See Iturribarria, </em>321 F.3d at 899-90 (prejudice results when the performance of counsel \u201cwas so inadequate that it may have affected the outcome of the proceedings\u201d) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b600-17\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b600-13\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
