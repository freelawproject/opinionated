Elam, Texas prisoner # 380190, was convicted by a jury of aggravated robbery and was sentenced to life in prison. In 2008, Elam filed in Texas state court an amended motion under Texas Code of Criminal Procedure Article 64.01, seeking post-conviction DNA testing of certain trial evidence that was identified by the State as available. The Texas state trial court denied Elam\u2019s request; the Texas state court of appeals affirmed; and his petition for discretionary review was refused. Elam then filed the instant civil rights complaint in the district court, alleging that the State courts\u2019 denial of his motion under Texas Code of Criminal Procedure Article 64.01 violated his procedural due process rights. The district court dismissed Elam\u2019s claims as frivolous and for failure to state a claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-23\">This court reviews the dismissal of Elam\u2019s claims de novo. <em>Samford v. Dretke, </em>562 F.3d 674, 678 (5th Cir.2009); <em>Geiger v. Jowers, </em>404 F.3d 371, 373 (5th Cir.2005). To state a claim under \u00a7 1983, a plaintiff must allege that there was a violation of a right secured by the Constitution or laws of the United States and that the deprivation was committed by a person acting under the color of state law. <em>Sw. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number><em>Bell Tel., LP v. City of Houston, </em>529 F.3d 257, 260 (5th Cir.2008). While there is no freestanding right for a convicted defendant to obtain evidence for post-conviction DNA testing, Texas has created such a right, and, as a result, the state provided procedures must be adequate to protect the substantive rights provided. <em>Skinner v. Switzer, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 1289, 1293, 179 L.Ed.2d 233 (2011); <em>Dist. Attorney's Office for Third Judicial Dist. v. Osborne, </em>557 U.S. 52, 129 S.Ct. 2308, 2319-2322, 174 L.Ed.2d 38 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b304-6\">Chapter 64 of the Texas Code of Criminal Procedure permits a convicted defendant to move for post-conviction DNA testing of evidence. Tex.Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 64.01. One requirement necessary to be granted relief is that the movant \u201cestablishes by a preponderance of the evidence that ... the person would not have been convicted if exculpatory results had been obtained through DNA testing.\u201d Tex.Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 64.03(a)(l)(B)(2). The State courts and the district court determined that Elam did not satisfy this requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-7\">On appeal, Elam contends that his due process rights were violated by the State\u2019s denial of his request for post-conviction DNA testing because the evidence submitted at trial included unreliable and fabricated physical evidence and perjured testimony. Elam\u2019s arguments do not establish his due process rights were violated. Any further DNA testing of the evidence from Elam\u2019s trial would not be probative on the issue of Elam\u2019s guilt or innocence. See <em>Osborne, </em>129 S.Ct. at 2320; <em>Skinner, </em>131 S.Ct. at 1293; Tex.Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 64.03.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-8\">The judgment of the district court is affirmed. The district court\u2019s dismissal of Elam\u2019s \u00a7 1983 complaint as frivolous and for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted counts as a strike for purposes of \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 387-88 (5th Cir.1996). Elam is warned that if he accumulates three strikes, he will not be allowed to proceed IFP in any civil action or appeal unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b304-10\">AFFIRMED; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b303-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
