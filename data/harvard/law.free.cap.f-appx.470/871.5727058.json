No reversible error has been shown; we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-16\">Based on Stuyvesant\u2019s total offense level and his criminal history category, the presentence investigation report (\u201cPSI\u201d) calculated his advisory guidelines range as 135 to 168 months\u2019 imprisonment.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> But because the statutory mandatory minimum sentence for each of Stuyvesant\u2019s offenses was 20 years, <em>see </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A), the PSI concluded that his guidelines range was 240 months\u2019 imprisonment, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5G1.2(b).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b900-17\">In his objections to the PSI and at the sentencing hearing, Stuyvesant urged the district court to consider a downward departure, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5H1.4, based on his chronic hepatitis C, his end-stage liver disease, and his urgent need for a liver transplant. The district court rejected Stuyvesant\u2019s request and sentenced him to 240 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-18\">On appeal, Stuyvesant challenges the district court\u2019s denial of his downward departure motion. He concedes, however, that \u2014 absent such a departure \u2014 he is subject to a 20-year statutory mandatory min<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"873\">*873</page-number>imum sentence, pursuant to section 841(b)(1)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b901-5\">\u201cIt is well-settled that a district court is not authorized to sentence a defendant below the statutory mandatory minimum unless the government filed a substantial assistance motion pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(e) and U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1 or the defendant falls within the safety-valve of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(f).\u201d <em>United States v. Castaing-Sosa, </em>530 F.3d 1358, 1360 (11th Cir.2008). Here, the government did not file a substantial assistance motion and Stuyvesant \u2014 who has three criminal history points \u2014 was ineligible for safety-valve relief. Thus, the district court lacked discretion to sentence Stuyvesant below the statutory mandatory minimum sentence of 20 years\u2019 imprisonment.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b901-6\">On appeal, Stuyvesant requests that we reevaluate whether, in the light of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), a district court has authority to grant a departure below the statutory mandatory minimum sentence. We have already answered this question in the negative, concluding that \u201cthe district court remains bound by statutes designating mandatory minimum sentences even after the remedial holding of <em>[Booker].\u201d Castaing-Sosa, </em>530 F.3d at 1362.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b900-10\">. Stuyvesant does not challenge the PSI\u2019s guidelines calculations on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b900-19\">. Before trial, the government filed a notice, pursuant to 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 851, for an enhanced sentence based on Stuyvesant\u2019s earlier felony drug conviction.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b901-9\">. Although the district court erred in stating that it had discretion to depart below the mandatory minimum sentence, such error was harmless because it did not affect the sentence imposed. <em>See Williams v. United States, </em>503 U.S. 193, 112 S.Ct. 1112, 1120-21, 117 L.Ed.2d 341 (1992).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
