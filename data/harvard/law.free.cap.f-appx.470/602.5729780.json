We have-jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence factual findings. <em>Zehatye v. Gonzales, </em>453 F.3d 1182, 1184-85 (9th Cir.2006). We deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-8\">Zeledon-Mendoza testified that gang members, who believed he and a friend had reported them to police, indirectly threatened them and subsequently killed his friend, and he also testified that other gang members accosted and robbed him outside his church. Substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s determination that, even if credible, Zeledon-Mendoza did not demonstrate past persecution or a fear of future persecution on account of a protected ground. <em>See Parussimova v. Mukasey, </em>555 F.3d 734, 740 (9th Cir.2009) (\u201c[t]he Real ID Act requires that a protected ground represent \u2018one central reason\u2019 for an asylum applicant\u2019s persecution\u201d); <em>Soriano v. Holder, </em>569 F.3d 1162, 1164 (9th Cir.2009) (\u201cThe BIA permissibly found that Petitioner\u2019s fear of future persecution stems from the criminals\u2019 motive to retaliate against him for informing on them.\u201d); <em>Gormley v. Ashcroft, </em>364 F.3d 1172, 1177 (9th Cir.2004) (robberies did not establish persecution where petitioner did not show he was robbed on account of protected ground). Accordingly, Zeledon-Mendoza\u2019s asylum and withholding of removal claims fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-11\">Finally, substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s denial of CAT relief because Zeledon-Mendoza failed to establish it is more likely than not he would be tortured at the instigation of or with the acquiescence of the Honduran government. <em>See Silaya v. Mukasey, </em>524 F.3d 1066, 1073 (9th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b631-12\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b631-9\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
