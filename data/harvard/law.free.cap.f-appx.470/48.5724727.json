Dec. 20, 2010). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-6\">We review the BIA\u2019s denial of Khokhar\u2019s motion to reopen for abuse of discretion, <em>Ali v. Gonzales, </em>448 F.3d 515, 517 (2d Cir.2006), and the BIA\u2019s determination of changed country conditions for substantial evidence, <em>Jian Hui Shao v. Mukasey, </em>546 F.3d 138, 169 (2d Cir.2008). An alien may file one motion to reopen within 90 days of the agency\u2019s final administrative decision. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(A)(C)(i); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(2). Although Khokhar\u2019s motion was indisputably untimely and number-barred because it was filed more than two years after the agency\u2019s final order of removal and was his second motion, <em>see </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(A)(C)(i), there is no limitation on a motion filed to apply or reapply for asylum if it is \u201cbased on changed country conditions arising in the country of nationality or in the country to which deportation has been ordered, if such evidence is material and was not available and could not have been discovered or presented at the previous proceeding,\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(3)(h); <em>see also </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(C)(ii). Here, Khokhar fails to challenge the BIA\u2019s dispositive finding that he failed to satisfy this changed conditions exception, thus waiving any such argument. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(3)(h); <em>Gui Yin Liu v. INS, </em>508 F.3d 716, 723 n. 6 (2d Cir.2007) (deeming arguments not raised before the Court abandoned). Accordingly, Khokhar\u2019s failure to challenge the BIA\u2019s dispositive finding is fatal to his petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-7\">Nevertheless, we note that the BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion, as the evidence Khokhar submitted was available, could have been presented at his prior hearing, and did not establish a material change in country conditions since Khokhar\u2019s May 2006 proceeding. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(C)(h); <em>see also </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(3)(h).</p>\n<p id=\"b77-9\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. As we have completed our review, the pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DENIED as moot.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
