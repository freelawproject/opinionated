Mukasey, </em>538 F.3d 1167, 1170 (9th Cir.2008); <em>see also </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(6)(C), (c)(7)(B). Kim conceded at oral argument that if the motion was a motion for reconsideration, it was untimely. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(6)(B). Because the motion was a motion for reconsideration, it was properly denied as untimely.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-6\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b610-17\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
