Reversible error has been shown; we vacate and remand for additional proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-27\">Betzner was convicted of various drug trafficking offenses and received a total sentence of 15 years\u2019 imprisonment followed by 2 concurrent 10-year special pa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"745\">*745</page-number>role terms. In 1995, Betzner filed a motion to set aside his special parole terms. The district court granted the motion in part, vacating Betzner\u2019s special parole term for one of his offenses, but left the remainder of his sentence \u2014 including the remaining 10-year special parole term\u2014 unchanged.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-5\">In 2009, Betzner filed a petition for writ of <em>coram nobis, </em>which the district-court construed as a section 2255 motion to vacate. Because Betzner had already filed a section 2255 in 1995<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> \u2014 and had not obtained authorization from this Court to file a second section 2255 motion \u2014 the district court dismissed the motion without prejudice as successive. Betzner then filed the instant motion for new trial, reasserting the same arguments as contained in his petition for writ of <em>coram nobis. </em>The district court again construed the motion as a section 2255 motion and dismissed it without prejudice as successive.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-6\">We granted a certificate of appealability (\u201cCOA\u201d) on this issue:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b773-7\">Whether the district court erred, in light of the Supreme Court\u2019s intervening decision in <em>Magwood v. Patterson, </em>561 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 2788, 177 L.Ed.2d 592 (2010), in finding that Betzner\u2019s 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion was second or successive, where it was his first \u00a7 2255 motion challenging an amended judgment of conviction.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b773-10\">We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s dismissal of a section 2255 motion as second or successive. <em>McIver v. United States, </em>307 F.3d 1327, 1329 (11th Cir.2002). And in section 2255 proceedings, we review legal issues <em>de novo </em>and factual findings for clear error. <em>Lynn v. United States, </em>365 F.3d 1225, 1232 (11th Cir.2004).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b773-14\">The Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act (\u201cAEDPA\u201d) provides that, if a section 2255 motion is \u201csecond or successive,\u201d it cannot proceed unless authorized by the appropriate court of appeals. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2244(b)(3)(A), 2255(h). Without such authorization, the district court must dismiss a second or successive section 2255 motion for lack of jurisdiction. <em>Williams v. Chatman, </em>510 F.3d 1290, 1295 (11th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b773-15\">The Supreme Court recently addressed whether the AEDPA\u2019s restriction on \u201csecond or successive\u201d habeas petitions applied to a defendant who had already filed a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 petition attacking his original judgment but who then filed a second section 2254 petition attacking a second intervening judgment. <em>Magwood, </em>130 S.Ct. at 2795. In doing so, the Court reasoned that because a habeas petitioner seeks the invalidation of his state court judgment, \u201cthe phrase \u2018second or successive\u2019 must be interpreted with respect to the judgment challenged.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2797. Thus, when \u201cthere is a \u2018new judgment intervening between the two habeas petitions,\u2019 [a petition] challenging the resulting new judgment is not \u2018second or successive\u2019 at all.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2802 (citation omitted). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"746\">*746</page-number>\u201c[T]he existence of a new judgment is dis-positive.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at2800.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b774-4\">Because <em>Magwood </em>was decided after the district court dismissed Betzner\u2019s section 2255 motion, the district court did not have the opportunity to consider whether the 1995 modification to Betzner\u2019s sentence constituted an intervening \u201cnew judgment\u201d as contemplated by the Supreme Court. As a result, we vacate the district court\u2019s order and remand with instructions to determine whether Betzner\u2019s section 2255 motion is successive in the light of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Magwood,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b774-5\">VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b773-11\">. Although neither Betzner\u2019s 1995 motion nor the court\u2019s 1995 order referenced section 2255 specifically, Betzner sought to attack collaterally and to vacate his sentence and, thus, section 2255 was the appropriate avenue for relief. <em>See Antonelli v. Warden, U.S.P. Atlanta, </em>542 F.3d 1348, 1352 n. 1 (11th Cir.2008) (\"[A] \u00a7 2255 motion is the exclusive remedy for a federal prisoner to collaterally attack his conviction and sentence, except in rare cases where it is inadequate to do so.\u201d). We see no error in \u2014 and Betzner does not challenge \u2014 the district court\u2019s factual determination that his 1995 motion was filed pursuant to section 2255.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b773-17\">. In addition, we construe liberally <em>pro se </em>pleadings. <em>Tannenbaum v. United States, </em>148 F.3d 1262, 1263 (11th Cir.1998).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b774-17\">. The Supreme Court has indicated that <em>Mag-wood </em>applies retroactively to cases on collateral review and to cases involving section 2255 motions. <em>See Garza v. United </em>States, - U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 1469, 179 L.Ed.2d 293 (2011) (vacating and remanding for the court of appeals to reconsider whether the defendant's section 2255 motion was successive in the light of <em>Magwood, </em>which was decided after the appellate court's initial decision).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b774-31\">. Because we must resolve jurisdictional issues before addressing whether a claim is procedurally defaulted, we decline to address the government\u2019s argument that Betzner\u2019s instant section 2255 motion is time-barred. <em>See Steel Co. v. Citizens for a Better Env\u2019t, </em>523 U.S. 83, 118 S.Ct. 1003, 1012-16, 140 L.Ed.2d 210 (1998).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
