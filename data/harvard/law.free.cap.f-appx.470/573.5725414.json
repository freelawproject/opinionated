We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence the agency\u2019s factual findings and review de novo its legal conclusions. <em>Santos-Lemus v. Mukasey, </em>542 F.3d 738, 742 (9th Cir.2008). We deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-22\">Arce contends that gang members, during two separate robbery attempts, beat him due to his membership in a particular social group. Taking into account all of Aree\u2019s evidence, the record does not compel the conclusion that the gang members targeted him on account of a protected ground. See <em>Parussimova v. Mukasey, </em>555 F.3d 734, 740-41 (9th Cir.2009) (\u201c[t]he Real ID Act requires that a protected ground represent \u2018one central reason\u2019 for an asylum applicant\u2019s persecution\u201d). Accordingly, because Arce did not show a nexus to a protected ground, his asylum and withholding of removal claims fail. See <em>Ochoa v. Gonzales, </em>406 F.3d 1166, 1172 (9th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b601-23\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b601-30\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
