After review, we affirm.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b867-7\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b867-8\">In 1996, a jury convicted Parson of conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute cocaine base. Parson was sentenced to life imprisonment. On direct appeal, Parson challenged his conviction, but not his sentence. This Court affirmed. <em>See United States v. Hutchins, </em>181 F.3d 107 (11th Cir.1999) (table).</p>\n<p id=\"b867-9\">Parson later filed a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion to vacate his sentence arguing, based on <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), that his indictment did not allege a drug quantity and his life sentence exceeded the statutory maximum authorized by the jury\u2019s verdict. The district court denied Parson\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion because <em>Apprendi </em>does not apply retroactively on collateral review. This Court denied a certificate of appealability.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-10\">Parson filed a second \u00a7 2255 motion, arguing that he was \u201cfactually innocent\u201d of the life sentence because drug quantity was not alleged in his indictment or proven to a jury. The district court dismissed Parson\u2019s second \u00a7 2255 motion for failure to obtain this Court\u2019s authorization pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(b)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b867-11\">Parson then filed the present motion which, while citing to Rule 36, argued that the 1996 sentencing court erred in determining the quantity of drugs attributable to Parson and Parson\u2019s role in the offense for purposes of calculating the applicable guidelines range.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-15\">In a September 28, 2011 order, the district court denied Parson\u2019s Rule 36 motion because Rule 36 authorizes only the correction of clerical mistakes, and Parson\u2019s motion did not identify any clerical mistakes meriting correction. The district court noted that even if it construed Parson\u2019s pleading as one seeking relief under \u00a7 2255, it would be denied, because Parson had not obtained leave to file a successive motion, as required by \u00a7 2244(b)(3). Parson filed this appeal of the district court\u2019s September 28, 2011 order.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-16\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b867-17\">Rule 36 allows a court to correct \u201ca clerical error in a judgment, order, or other part of the record, or correct an error in the record arising from oversight or omission.\u201d Fed.R.Crim.P. 36. Rule 36 does not allow for a substantive correction or alteration to a criminal sentence. <em>United States v. Portillo, </em>363 F.3d 1161, 1164 (11th Cir.2004). Rule 36 is intended for situations where, for example, the written judgment needs to conform to the oral sentence. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b867-18\">Even construed liberally, Parson\u2019s appellate brief does not challenge the district court\u2019s finding that Parson\u2019s Rule 36 motion did not identify a clerical error in his sentence. Further, a review of Parson\u2019s Rule 36 motion indicates that the district court is correct. Parson\u2019s Rule 36 motion raised only a substantive challenge to his sentence and did not point to any clerical error with respect to his sentence. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"840\">*840</page-number>Accordingly, the district court properly denied Parson\u2019s Rule 36 motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-4\">On appeal, Parson argues only that in 1996 the sentencing court erred in making findings as to drug quantity and role in the offense.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> However, Parson needed to (but did not) raise these alleged sentencing errors in his direct appeal from the judgment and sentence; he cannot raise them fifteen years later in a post-conviction motion. <em>See United States v. Fiallo-Jacome, </em>874 F.2d 1479, 1482-83 (11th Cir.1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b868-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b867-12\">. We review <em>de novo </em>the application of Rule 36 to correct a district court's sentencing judgment. <em>United States v. Portillo, </em>363 F.3d 1161, 1164 (11th Cir.2004).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b868-17\">. Parsons does not contend that he intended to challenge his sentence under \u00a7 2255. In any event, the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to consider a \u00a7 2255 motion because Parson has not obtained permission from this Court to file a successive \u00a7 2255 motion. See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2244(b)(3)(A), 2255(h).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
