Amundsen appeals pro se from the district court\u2019s order denying his motion to vacate a permanent injunction entered against him in 1983. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>review for an abuse of discretion, <em>Casey v. Albertson\u2019s Inc., </em>362 F.3d 1254, 1257 (9th Cir.2004), and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-4\">The district court did not abuse its discretion by denying Amundsen\u2019s motion under Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b)(5) because Amundsen failed to demonstrate that any changed circumstances have made his compliance with the injunction \u201csubstantially more onerous, unworkable because of unforeseen obstacles, detrimental to the public interest, or legally impermissible.\u201d <em>SEC v. Coldicutt, </em>258 F.3d 939, 942 (9th Cir.2001) (district court did not abuse its discretion by denying the plaintiffs request to terminate a permanent injunction due to changed circumstances).</p>\n<p id=\"b680-5\">To the extent that Amundsen\u2019s motion falls within Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b)(3), the district court lacked jurisdiction to consider it because Amundsen filed his motion more than one year after judgment was entered. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(c)(1) (Rule 60(b)(3) motion must be made within one year of entry of judgment); <em>Nevitt v.
