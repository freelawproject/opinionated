The district court calculated Brooks\u2019 Guidelines range under the <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>(2010) at 360 months to life in prison and sentenced Brooks to 252 months\u2019 imprisonment. On appeal, Brooks\u2019 counsel has filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), stating that there are no meritorious issues for appeal, but questioning whether the district court erred in its calculation of the drug weight attributable to Brooks. Brooks has filed a pro se supplemental brief in which he raises challenges to his sentence. The Government has moved to dismiss the appeal of Brooks\u2019 sentence based on his waiver of appellate rights. We dismiss in part and affirm in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-9\">A defendant may waive the right to appeal if that waiver is knowing and intelligent. <em>United States v. Poindexter, </em>492 F.3d 263, 270 (4th Cir.2007). Generally, if the district court fully questions a defendant regarding the waiver of his right to appeal during a plea colloquy performed in accordance with Fed.R.Crim.P. 11, the waiver is both valid and enforceable. <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>410 F.3d 137, 151 (4th Cir.2005). Whether a defendant validly waived his right to appeal is a question of law that this court reviews de novo. <em>United States v. Blick, </em>408 F.3d 162, 168 (4th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b225-11\">Our review of the record leads us to conclude that Brooks knowingly and voluntarily waived the right to appeal his sentence. We therefore grant the Government\u2019s motion to dismiss and dismiss the appeal of Brooks\u2019 sentence. Although Brooks\u2019 appeal waiver insulates his sentence from appellate review, the waiver does not prohibit our review of Brooks\u2019 conviction pursuant to <em>Anders. </em>In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the remainder of the record in this case and have found no meritorious issues for review. We therefore affirm Brooks\u2019 conviction and dismiss the appeal of his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-12\">This court requires that counsel inform Brooks, in writing, of the right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If Brooks requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on Brooks.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-13\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-14\">\n<em>DISMISSED IN PART; AFFIRMED IN PART.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
