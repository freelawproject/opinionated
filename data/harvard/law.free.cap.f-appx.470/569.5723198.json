Our jurisdiction is governed by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence factual findings, <em>Wakkary v. Holder, </em>558 F.3d 1049, 1056 (9th Cir.2009), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>and we dismiss in part and deny in part the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-5\">On November 17, 2010, the BIA reopened proceedings with respect to Johannis (A078-O2(M00), so that he could pursue adjustment of status. Consequently, there is no final order of removal currently in effect as to Johannis, and this, court lacks jurisdiction over his petition for review. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(1); <em>cf. Alcala v. Holder, </em>563 F.3d 1009 (9th Cir.2009). We dismiss the petition for review with respect to Johannis.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-6\">In the opening brief, Maurits does not challenge the agency\u2019s dispositive finding that his application for asylum was untimely. Accordingly, we deny the petition for review as to his asylum claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-7\">With respect to withholding of removal, Maurits does not claim he suffered any harm in Indonesia due to his Christianity, but he fears he will be persecuted in the future. Even as a member of a disfavored group, the record does not compel the conclusion Maurits established a clear probability of persecution, because he failed to demonstrate his general, undifferentiated fear of harm is distinct from the fears felt by all other Christians in Indonesia. <em>See Lolong v. Gonzales, </em>484 F.3d 1173, 1181 (9th Cir.2007) (en banc) (\u201cIn sum, [petitioner] has provided no evidence that [he] has been, or is likely to be, specifically targeted for persecution by any individual or group in Indonesia.\u201d); see <em>also Halim v. Holder, </em>590 F.3d 971, 979 (9th Cir.2009). Accordingly, Maurits\u2019 withholding of removal claim fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-8\">Finally, substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s denial of Maurits\u2019 CAT claim because he failed to show it is more likely than not that he will be tortured if returned to Indonesia. <em>See id. </em>at 1067-68.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-12\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DISMISSED in part; DENIED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b598-15\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir. R. 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
