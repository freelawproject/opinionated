Jordan contends that the Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) erred in finding that she was ineligible for benefits under either the listings for child or adult mental retardation. She also challenges the ALJ\u2019s failure to elicit testimony from a vocational expert (VE) in determining that she was capable of substantial gainful activity. After careful consideration, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-18\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-19\">Our review of the ALJ\u2019s decision is limited; we ask only whether it was supported by substantial evidence and was based upon the correct legal standards. <em>Crawford v. Comm\u2019r of Soc. Sec., </em>363 F.3d 1155, 1158 (11th Cir.2004). \u201cSubstantial evidence is something more than a mere scintilla, but less than a preponderance.\u201d <em>Dyer v. Barnhart, </em>395 F.3d 1206, 1210 (11th Cir.2005) (internal quotation marks omitted). Substantial evidence need only be what a reasonable person would accept as adequate to support a conclusion. <em>Crawford, </em>363 F.3d at 1158 (citation omitted). \u201cIf the Commissioner\u2019s decision is supported by substantial evidence, this .Court must affirm, even if the proof preponderates against it.\u201d <em>Phillips v. Barnhart, 357 </em>F.3d 1232, 1240 n. 8 (11th Cir.2004). \u201cWe may not decide facts anew, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"768\">*768</page-number>reweigh the evidence, or substitute our judgment for that of the Commissioner.\u201d <em>Dyer, </em>395 F.3d at 1210 (internal quotation marks and alteration omitted). Where, as here, the Appeals Council denies review of the ALJ\u2019s decision, we review the ALJ\u2019s decision as the final decision of the Commissioner. <em>Doughty v. Apfel, </em>245 F.3d 1274, 1278 (11th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b796-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-5\">Jones argues that she was entitled to benefits both before and after she turned 18 because she satisfied the descriptions in the social security listings for child mental retardation and adult mental retardation.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-6\">For adults, \u201c[t]he social security regulations establish a five-step evaluation process, which is used to determine disability....\u201d <em>Moore v. Barnhart, </em>405 F.3d 1208, 1211 (11th Cir.2005). Jones first contends that the ALJ\u2019s determination at the third step of this process was erroneous. In that step, the question is \u201cwhether the impairment meets or equals the severity of the specified impairments in the Listing of Impairments,\u201d and the claimant bears the burden of proof. <em>Winschel v. Comm\u2019r of Soc. Sec., </em>631 F.3d 1176, 1178 (11th Cir.2011). Jones directs our attention to the Listing for adult mental retardation, 20 C.F.R. part 404, subpart P, appendix 1, \u00a7 12.05 (\u201cListing 12.05\u201d), and claims that she has satisfied its requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-7\">For persons under the age of 18, the analytical framework is somewhat different, requiring that a claimant show \u201ca medically determinable physical or mental impairment, which results in marked and severe functional limitations, and which ... can be expected to last for a continuous period of not less than 12 months\u201d in order to be entitled to SSI benefits. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1382c(a)(3)(C)(i); 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.924. Jones contends that the ALJ erroneously rejected her contention that she had demonstrated a mental impairment by satisfying the requirements of the Listing that describes child mental retardation, 20 C.F.R. part 404, subpart P, appendix 1, \u00a7 112.05 (\u201cListing 112.05\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b796-10\">Although the overarching analytical framework for child and adult disability claims varies, the elements of Listings 112.05 and 12.05 substantially overlap, and the regulations provide guidance about how ALJs and courts are to apply both. A claimant must satisfy both \u201cthe diagnostic description in the introductory paragraph <em>and </em>any one of\u2019 several additional criteria. 20 C.F.R. pt. 404, subpt. P, app. 1, \u00a7 12.00 (emphasis supplied); <em>id. </em>\u00a7 112.00 (same). The introductory paragraphs for both Listings, in turn, require \u201csignificantly subaverage general intellectual functioning with deficits in adaptive functioning,\u201d for adults, manifested prior to age 22. 20 C.F.R. pt. 404, subpt. P, app. 1, \u00a7 12.05; <em>id. </em>\u00a7 112.05. As both the Listings and our cases make plain, a claimant must demonstrate both subaverage intellectual functioning and deficits in adaptive functioning, as well satisfying one of the additional criteria, to prove entitlement to disability benefits under Listing 12.05 or 112.05. See <em>Crayton v. Callahan, </em>120 F.3d 1217, 1219 (11th Cir.1997); <em>see also Sullivan v. Zebley, </em>493 U.S. 521, 530, 110 S.Ct. 885, 107 L.Ed.2d 967 (1990) (\u201cFor a claimant to show that his impairment matches a listing, it must meet <em>all </em>of the specified\u201d requirements \u2014 \u201c[a]n impairment that manifests only some ... no matter how severely, does not qualify.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b796-11\">Here, Dr. Bruce Borkosky, a psychologist who evaluated Jordan in 2006, concluded that her overall mental status was \u201clow average,\u201d and diagnosed her with \u201cborderline intellectual functioning,\u201d a diagnosis that is mutually exclusive of mental retardation. <em>See </em>Am. Psychiatric <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"769\">*769</page-number>Ass\u2019n, Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders 47-48, 741 (4th ed. text rev.2000) (explaining the importance of diagnostically \u201c[d]ifferentiating Mild Mental Retardation from Borderline Intellectual Functioning\u201d based upon \u201ccareful consideration of all available information\u201d). State agency psychologists Dr. David Guttman and Dr. Thomas Conger made the same diagnosis. The ALJ found, based upon Jordan\u2019s own testimony, her report card, and an evaluation by one of her teachers, that Jordan had completed the 11th grade without repeating any grade, principally in \u201cgeneral education classes,\u201d and was ranked in the top 1/3 of her high school class. She was able to read and write as well as perform basic math, albeit with some difficulty in division. Thus, ample evidence supported the conclusion that Jordan did not specifically meet either Listing.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-5\">Nor did she demonstrate that her mental impairment was equivalent to the Listings. In order to demonstrate that her deficits in adaptive functioning were functionally equivalent to the Listings, Jordan was required to demonstrate a \u201cmarked\u201d limitation in two, or \u201cextreme\u201d limitation in one, of six \u201cdomains,\u201d which set forth broad areas of functioning. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.926a(b)(l). Jordan\u2019s special education teacher identified only minor problems with any of the domains and a childhood disability evaluation completed by two state agency medical consultants, Thomas Peele and Dr. Jane Cormier, determined that Jordan had \u201cless than marked\u201d limitations in four of the domains, with no limitations at all in the other two. Dr. Guttman and Dr. Conger also expressly concluded that Jordan\u2019s impairments did not meet, medically equal, or functionally equal the Listings\u2019 requirements. The ALJ expressly gave \u201cgreat weight\u201d to these assessments.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-8\">Jordan\u2019s contention that she satisfied Listings 112.05 and 12.05 essentially ignores the requirements in the Listings\u2019 introductory paragraphs and focuses exclusively upon the several subsequent criteria. And, in so doing, she asks us to discount the opinions of multiple mental health experts and to give greater weight to her testimony and that of her mother, both of which the ALJ determined were entitled only to minimal weight. This we may not do. <em>Moore, </em>405 F.3d at 1211. The mental health opinions of Dr. Borkosky, Jordan\u2019s special education teacher, and the state agency mental health experts supported the conclusion that Jordan did not manifest the deficits set forth in the Listings\u2019 introductory paragraphs. Therefore, substantial evidence supported the ALJ\u2019s determination that Jordan was not disabled because her mental impairment did not meet, medically equal, or functionally equal either the child or adult mental retardation Listings.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-9\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-10\">Even if her claim to disability under the mental retardation Listings cannot succeed, Jordan argues that the ALJ erred in deciding, without consulting a VE, that she was not disabled.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b797-11\">Because the ALJ found that Jordan had a severe combination of impairments that did not satisfy any Listing and no past work experience, the Commissioner bore the burden to \u201cshow the existence of other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"770\">*770</page-number>jobs in the national economy which, given [Jordan\u2019s] impairments, [she] can perform.\u201d <em>Jones v. Apfel, </em>190 F.3d 1224, 1228-29 (11th Cir.1999). Unless \u201cthe claimant cannot perform a full range of work at a <em>given level of </em>exertion or the claimant has non-exertional impairments that significantly limit basic work skills,\u201d the Commissioner may meet this burden by relying on the Medical-Vocational Guidelines, also known as the Grids. <em>Id. </em>at 1229. In this case, the ALJ found that Jordan had the residual functional capacity to perform medium exertional work and that her non-exertional impairments did not significantly affect the types of work that she could perform. The ALJ relied exclusively upon the Grids to reach this conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-4\">Jordan argues that borderline intellectual functioning constitutes a significant nonexertional limitation on her basic work skills, that the ALJ\u2019s decision to the contrary was not supported by substantial evidence, and, thus, that a VE\u2019s testimony was required. Although borderline intellectual functioning may, in conjunction with other conditions, contribute to a finding that an individual\u2019s impairments significantly limit her basic work skills, there is no merit to Jordan\u2019s suggestion that it mandates that conclusion. <em>See Allen v. Sullivan, </em>880 F.2d 1200, 1202 (11th Cir.1989) (holding that borderline intellectual functioning in conjunction with a series of other mental, physical, and emotional impairments precluded reliance upon the Grids).</p>\n<p id=\"b798-5\">All of the jobs listed in the Grids are unskilled, meaning that they require \u201clittle or no judgment\u201d in the performance of \u201csimple duties that can be learned on the job in a short period of time.\u201d 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.968(a); 20 C.F.R. pt. 404, subpt. P, app. 2, \u00a7 200.00(b) (stating that jobs in the Grids are unskilled).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Only if a claimant\u2019s impairment significantly limits her ability to perform such duties is the testimony of a VE strictly required. <em>Jones, </em>190 F.3d at 1228-29.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-11\">Jordan had a driver\u2019s license, she was able to perform simple math, read, and write, and she agreed that she had no difficulty making change. At least four state agency evaluators determined that she had no limitation in moving and manipulating objects, and little limitation in acquiring and using information, attending and completing tasks, and interacting and relating with others. No evidence suggested that Jordan\u2019s impairments \u2014 which according to multiple evaluations were relatively minor while Jordan was under the age of 18 \u2014 worsened after she attained the age of 18. And Jordan had successfully completed a formal education through the 11th grade. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. pt. 404, subpt. P, app. 2, \u00a7 203.25 (stating that younger individual with the residual functional capacity to perform medium work who has a limited education and no work experience is not disabled); 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.964(b)(2) (stating that formal education through the 11th grade constitutes a limited education).</p>\n<p id=\"b798-12\">Thus, although Jordan is correct that contrary evidence exists, substantial evidence supported the ALJ\u2019s finding that Jordan\u2019s capacity for unskilled medium work was not significantly compromised by her non-exertional mental impairments. For that reason, the ALJ did not err in relying on the Grids, without testimony from a VE, to establish the existence of jobs in the national economy that Jordan <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"771\">*771</page-number>could perform and, thereby, to conclude that she was not disabled.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-5\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-6\">After thorough review of the record, the decisions of the ALJ and the district court, and the parties briefs, we affirm the Commissioner\u2019s denial of benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b797-6\">. Jordan has only challenged the ALJ\u2019s decision that a VE\u2019s testimony was unnecessary based upon the effect of her mental impairments. Therefore, we do not address the effect, if any, of Jordan\u2019s physical impairments upon her residual functional capacity. <em>Norelus v. Denny\u2019s, Inc., </em>628 F.3d 1270, 1296-97 (11th Cir.2010); <em>Stewart v. Dept. of Health and Human Servs., </em>26 F.3d 115, 115-16 (11th Cir.1994).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b798-6\">. For the first time on appeal, Jordan argues that VE testimony was required because at least some unskilled jobs require a certain reasoning level, as defined in the <em>Dictionaiy of Occupational Titles. </em>This argument is waived. <em>See Kelley v. Apfel, </em>185 F.3d 1211, 1215 (11th Cir.1999).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
