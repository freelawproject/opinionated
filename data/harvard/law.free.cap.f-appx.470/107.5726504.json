McPherson was sentenced to a total of 117 months\u2019 imprisonment, 57 months for Counts 1, 2, 3, 5 and 6, and 60 months, consecutive, for Count 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-22\">On appeal, counsel filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), asserting there are no meritorious grounds for appeal, but raising the following issues: (1) whether the district court complied with Fed.R.Crim.P. 11 when it accepted McPherson\u2019s guilty plea to Count 1; (2) whether McPherson\u2019s sentence was procedurally and substantively reasonable; (3) whether the district court erred by denying McPherson\u2019s motion to withdraw his guilty plea; and (4) whether defense coun<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>sel was ineffective. For the reasons that follow, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-4\">First, we find no reversible error in the district court\u2019s Rule 11 colloquy for Count 1. <em>United States v. Goins, </em>51 F.3d 400, 402 (4th Cir.1995) (noting harmless error review standard for asserted Rule 11 errors). Second, we find that McPherson\u2019s sentence was procedurally and substantively reasonable. The court imposed the sentence after careful consideration of the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) (2006) factors, and the sentence was within the properly calculated advisory Sentencing Guidelines range. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 49, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007); <em>United States v. Carter, </em>564 F.3d 325, 328 (4th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b136-5\">Next, we find no abuse of discretion in the district court\u2019s decision to deny McPherson\u2019s motion to withdraw his guilty plea. <em>United States v. Ubakanma, </em>215 F.3d 421, 424 (4th Cir.2000) (stating review standard). A defendant bears the burden of demonstrating to the district court\u2019s satisfaction that a \u201cfair and just reason\u201d supports his request to withdraw. Fed. R.Crim.P. 11(h).</p>\n<p id=\"b136-6\">Finally, claims of ineffective assistance of counsel are not cognizable on direct appeal unless the record conclusively establishes that defense counsel did not provide effective representation. <em>United States v. Richardson, </em>195 F.3d 192, 198 (4th Cir.1999); <em>United States v. Gastiaburo, </em>16 F.3d 582, 590 (4th Cir.1994). McPherson has failed to meet this demanding burden. To allow for adequate development of the record, claims of ineffective assistance generally should be brought, if at all, in a 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2255 (West Supp.2011) motion. <em>Gastiaburo, </em>16 F.3d at 590.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-7\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the record in this case and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. We therefore affirm McPherson\u2019s convictions and sentence. This court requires that counsel inform McPherson, in writing, of the right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If McPherson requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on McPherson. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-9\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
