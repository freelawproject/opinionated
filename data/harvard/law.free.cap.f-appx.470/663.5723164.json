We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-16\">Dominguez-Mendoza contends that the district court procedurally erred by failing to establish the proper Sentencing Guidelines range at the outset of the sentencing hearing, by treating the Guidelines as mandatory, and by stating that it needed to find exceptional or extraordinary circumstances to vary from the Guidelines. The district court\u2019s failure to expressly calculate the Guidelines range, and its misconception that exceptional or extraordinary circumstances are required to vary from the Guidelines, did not affect Dominguez-Mendoza\u2019s substantial rights, as the probation officer correctly calculated the Guidelines range and the district court provided sufficient reasons for the sentence. <em>See United States v. Dallman, </em>533 F.3d 755, 761 (9th Cir.2008). Further, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>record reflects that the district court did not- treat the Guidelines as mandatory.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-5\">Dominguez-Mendoza also , contends that the sentences imposed are substantively unreasonable. The consecutive sentences at the bottom of the respective Guidelines ranges are substantively reasonable under the totality of the circumstances and in light of the sentencing factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3553(a) and 3583(e). <em>See Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b693-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b692-10\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9 th Cir.
