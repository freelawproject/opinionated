The district court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> sentenced him to 180 months in prison, which was 30 months below the calculated Guidelines range. On appeal, his counsel seeks leave to withdraw, and has filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), arguing that the district court erred in failing to vary even further below the Guidelines range.</p>\n<p id=\"ASM\">We will enforce the appeal waiver because Salmons\u2019s appeal falls within the scope of the waiver, the record shows that he entered into the plea agreement and the waiver knowingly and voluntarily, and enforcing the waiver will not result in a miscarriage of justice. <em>See United States v. Andis, </em>333 F.3d 886, 889-92 (8th Cir.2003) (en banc) (criteria for enforcing appeal waiver); <em>United States v. Estrada-Bahena, </em>201 F.3d 1070, 1071 (8th Cir.2000) (per curiam) (enforcing appeal waiver in <em>Anders </em>case).</p>\n<p id=\"Azr\">Having reviewed the record independently under <em>Penson v. Ohio, </em>488 U.S. 75, 80, 109 S.Ct. 346, 102 L.Ed.2d 300 (1988), we find no nonfrivolous issues outside the scope of the appeal waiver. Accordingly, we grant counsel leave to withdraw, and we dismiss this appeal.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"ArSB\">. The Honorable Nanette K. Laughrey, United States District Judge for the Western District of Missouri.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
