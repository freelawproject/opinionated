We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>Gomez contends that the district court improperly imposed a sentencing enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Ll.l(b)(6) because there was inadequate evidence that he intentionally or recklessly created a substantial risk of death or serious bodily injury. The record reflects that Gomez fled border patrol agents at a high rate of speed, nearly side-swiped a border patrol vehicle, and crashed on the premises of a junior high school, resulting in serious bodily injury to the passenger of his vehicle. Accordingly, the district court did not abuse its discretion by imposing the enhancement. <em>See United States v. Mix, </em>457 F.3d 906, 911 (9th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b597-5\">Gomez also contends that the district court improperly imposed a four-level sentencing enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Ll.l(b)(7) for causing serious bodily injury because there was inadequate evidence that his actions proximately caused the passenger\u2019s injuries. There was sufficient evidence in the record for the district court to conclude that Gomez was the cause of the passenger\u2019s injuries. Accordingly, the district court did not abuse its discretion by imposing the serious bodily injury enhancement. <em>See United States v. Mix, </em>457 F.3d 906, 911 (9th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b597-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b596-24\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
