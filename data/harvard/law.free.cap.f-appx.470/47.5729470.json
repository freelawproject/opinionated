Fuller, Ill\u2019s conviction for violating 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2250, <em>see Fuller v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 132 S.Ct. 1534, 182 L.Ed.2d 152 (2012), <em>vacating </em>627 F.3d 499 (2d Cir.2010), and remanding the case for further consideration in light of <em>Reynolds v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 132 S.Ct. 975, 181 L.Ed.2d 935 (2012). On remand, Fuller argues that the Supreme Court\u2019s decisions in <em>Reynolds </em>and <em>Carr v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 2229, 176 L.Ed.2d 1152 (2010), compel vacatur of his \u00a7 2250 conviction. The United States agrees. We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the facts and the record of prior proceedings, which we reference only as necessary to explain our decision to vacate and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-27\">Fuller contends that his charged conduct in traveling from Missouri to New York between July 27, 2006, and February 28, 2007, and thereafter failing to register under the Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act (\u201cSORNA\u201d), did not violate \u00a7 2250 as now construed by the Supreme Court. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-28\">In <em>Carr, </em>the Supreme Court held that \u201c[o]nce a person becomes subject to SOR-NA\u2019s registration requirements ... that person can be convicted under \u00a7 2250 if he thereafter travels and then fails to register.\u201d <em>Carr v. United States, </em>130 S.Ct. at 2236. Subsequently, in <em>Reynolds, </em>the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>Court held that SORNA\u2019s \u201cregistration requirements do not apply to pre-[enactment] offenders until the Attorney General specifies that they do apply.\u201d <em>Reynolds v. United States, </em>132 S.Ct. at 978. Fuller, who was convicted of a sex offense prior to SORNA\u2019s enactment, traveled interstate before the Attorney General specified that SORNA\u2019s registration requirements applied to persons in Fuller\u2019s position. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 16913(d) (providing that \u201c[t]he Attorney General shall have the authority to specify the applicability of the [registration] requirements ... to sex offenders convicted before\u201d SORNA\u2019s enactment); <em>Reynolds v. United States, </em>132 S.Ct. at 978-79; 72 Fed.Reg. 8897 (Feb. 28, 2007) (codified at 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 72.3) (providing that \u201c[t]he requirements of [SORNA] apply to all sex offenders, including sex offenders convicted of the offense for which registration is required prior to the enactment of\u2019 SORNA). Thus, because Fuller was not required to register at the time of his interstate travel, his charged conduct did not violate \u00a7 2250. <em>See Carr v. United States, </em>130 S.Ct. at 2236. In light of this determination, we need not reach any of the other arguments for vacatur urged by Fuller on remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-4\">Accordingly, the judgment of conviction is VACATED and the case REMANDED with instructions to dismiss the indictment.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
