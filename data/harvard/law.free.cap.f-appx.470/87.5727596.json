For the reasons expressed below, we will affirm.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b116-16\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-17\">As we write primarily for the parties, we discuss only those facts necessary to our decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-18\">Shaun Brown worked as a platoon supervisor at the Montgomery County Emergency Operations Center (\u201cthe Center\u201d) from 2003 to 2008. His responsibilities included supervising the Center and ensuring that dispatchers responded appropriately to 911 calls. On December 23, 2007, Brown and several dispatchers participated in a holiday gift exchange while on duty. Brown was the only supervisor present at the time. Among other things, the employees exchanged cases of beer, bottles of liquor, and sex toys. One of the dispatchers took photographs of the event, which depicted dispatchers, including Brown, posing with alcohol and sex toys at their work stations. Brown posted four of these pictures on his MySpace page.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-19\">On March 6, 2008, the Salary Board of the Board of Commissioners voted to terminate Brown. After Brown\u2019s termination, newspaper articles appeared that detailed the events surrounding his firing. Though the articles did not mention Brown by name, the Commissioners were quoted as stating that the behavior that took place at the gift exchange was \u201cunbelievably stupid\u201d and \u201cmoronic.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Brown says that he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>requested a name-clearing hearing after his termination, but no such hearing was provided as the County believed that he was not entitled to one.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-5\">On September 4, 2008, Brown filed suit, claiming that the County fired him not as a consequence of the gift exchange, but in retaliation for reports he made to county employees, an independent contractor, regulatory authorities, and the media about alleged deficiencies in the Center\u2019s Computer-Aided Dispatch system. He argued that his termination violated the First Amendment, the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, and Pennsylvania\u2019s Whistleblower Law.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b117-6\">The County filed a Motion to Dismiss, which the District Court granted with respect to Brown\u2019s First Amendment and Whistleblower Law claims but denied with respect to his due process claim. After discovery was completed, the County filed a Motion for Summary Judgment on the due process claim, which the District Court granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-7\">II. The First Amendment and Whistleblower Law Claims Were Properly Dismissed</p>\n<p id=\"b117-8\">We exercise plenary review of a grant of a motion to dismiss, accepting all allegations in the complaint as true and drawing all reasonable inferences in the light most favorable to the plaintiff. <em>United States v. Occidental Chem. Corp., </em>200 F.3d 143 (3d Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b117-9\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-10\">The threshold inquiry when analyzing a retaliation claim is whether the speech in question is protected by the First Amendment. <em>Watters v. Philadelphia, </em>55 F.3d 886, 892 (3d Cir.1995). The Supreme Court has held that, \u201cwhen public employees make statements pursuant to their official duties, the employees are not speaking as citizens for First Amendment purposes, and the Constitution does not insulate their communications from employer discipline.\u201d <em>Garcetti v. Ceballos, </em>547 U.S. 410, 421, 126 S.Ct. 1951, 164 L.Ed.2d 689 (2006). We have added that statements relate to an employee\u2019s official duties when they derive from \u201cspecial knowledge\u201d or \u201cexperience\u201d acquired on the job. <em>Foraker v. Chaffinch, </em>501 F.3d 231 (3d Cir.2007), <em>abrogated in part by Duryea v. Guarnieri, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 2488, 180 L.Ed.2d 408 (2011); <em>see also Reilly v. Atl. City, </em>532 F.3d 216, 226 (3d Cir.2008) (\u201c[T]he First Amendment does not prohibit managerial discipline based on an employee\u2019s expressions made pursuant to official responsibilities.\u201d (internal quotation marks and citation omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b117-15\">In his capacity as platoon supervisor, Brown gained intimate knowledge of and experience with the Computer-Aided Dispatch system. Thus, Brown\u2019s reports were made pursuant to his official duties, and his statements do not receive First Amendment protection.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-16\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-17\">The Pennsylvania Whistleblower Law mandates that a person alleging a violation of its provisions must bring an action \u201cwithin 180 days after the occurrence of the alleged violation.\u201d 43 P.S. \u00a7 1424(a). This 180-day time limit is \u201cmandatory and must be strictly applied.\u201d <em>Jackson v. Lehigh Valley Physicians </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number><em>Group, </em>2009 WL 229756 at *5 (E.D.Pa. Jan.30, 2009); <em>see also O\u2019Rourke v. Pennsylvania Department of Corrections, </em>730 A.2d 1039, 1042 (Pa.Commw.Ct.1999) (\u201c[T]his 180-day time limit is mandatory, and courts have no discretion to extend it\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b118-5\">Brown claims that it was error to allow Montgomery County to assert the statute <em>of </em>limitations in a motion to dismiss because \u201cthe statute of limitations is an affirmative defense\u201d that is not properly resolved under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b). Appellant\u2019s Br. 18. Rule 12(b) states that \u201c[e]very defense ... must be asserted in the responsive pleading if one is required,\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b), though the Rule goes on to enumerate certain defenses that may be made by motion. Because the statute of limitations defense is not among those that Rule 12(b) allows to be brought by motion, a defendant wishing to invoke its protection must normally raise it in the answer. However, under the law of this Circuit (the so-called \u201cThird-Circuit Rule\u201d), such a defense may be asserted by motion to dismiss if \u201cthe time alleged in the statement of a claim shows that the cause of action has not been brought within the statute of limitations.\u201d <em>Hanna v. U.S. Veterans\u2019 Admin. Hasp., </em>514 F.2d 1092, 1094 (3d Cir.1975); <em>see also N\u2019Jai v. Floyd, </em>No. 07-1506, 2009 WL 4823839 at *5 (W.D.Pa. Dec.9, 2009) (\u201cIf the limitations bar is apparent on the face of the complaint, then it may be the basis for dismissal of the complaint under Rule 12(b)(6).\u201d), <em>aff'd, </em>386 Fed.Appx. 141 (3d Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b118-7\">In this case, Brown\u2019s amended complaint facially demonstrates noncompliance with the 180-day statutory limitations period of the Pennsylvania Whistleblower Act. The complaint lists March 7, 2008, as Brown\u2019s date of termination, and the District Court docket shows that Brown filed his complaint on September 4, 2008, exactly <em>181 </em>days later. Thus, the District Court properly dismissed Brown\u2019s Whistleblower Law claim under Rule 12(b)(6) as untimely.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-8\">III. The District Court Properly Granted Summary Judgment to Montgomery County on Brown\u2019s Due Process Claim</p>\n<p id=\"b118-9\">We exercise plenary review over the District Court\u2019s grant of summary judgment.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b118-10\">Summary judgment may be granted if, drawing all inferences in favor of the nonmoving party, \u201cthe pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b118-11\"><em>Orsatti v. New Jersey State Police, </em>71 F.3d 480, 482 (3d Cir.1995) (quoting Fed. R.Civ.P. 56(c)).</p>\n<p id=\"b118-12\">Brown alleges that Montgomery County deprived him of his liberty interest in his reputation by making false and defamatory public statements about him without providing a name-clearing hearing. Specifically, Brown claims that he was stigmatized by quotes from County employees that appeared in a March 7th <em>Philadelphia Inquirer </em>article (wherein Commissioner Matthews referred to the employees\u2019 conduct as \u201cmalfeasance\u201d)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>and a March 21 st article in The Morning Call (wherein Assistant County Solicitor Maureen Coggins was reported to have said that \u201cemployees violated county code by having alcohol on county property [and] ... violated the county\u2019s code of ethics by engaging in inappropriate behavior\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b119-6\">In order to state a claim for a \u00a7 198S due process liberty interest violation in the public employment context, a plaintiff must satisfy the \u201cstigma plus\u201d test. <em>See Hill v. Borough of Kutztown, </em>455 F.3d 225, 236 (3d Cir.2006). Under the \u201cstigma plus\u201d test, the \u201ccreation and dissemination of a false and defamatory impression is the \u2018stigma,\u2019 and the termination is the \u2018plus.\u2019 When such a deprivation occurs, the employee is entitled to a name-clearing hearing.\u201d <em>Id. </em>To satisfy the \u201cstigma\u201d prong of the test, the employee must show: 1) publication of 2) a substantially and materially false statement that 3) infringed upon the \u201creputation, honor, or integrity\u201d of the employee. <em>Ersek v. Springfield, </em>102 F.3d 79, 83-84 (3d Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b119-7\">Brown failed to satisfy the stigma prong of the test. Even if Commissioner Matthews\u2019 comments had been directed at him, such statements were not sufficiently stigmatizing to implicate a liberty interest. <em>Mercer v. Cedar Rapids, </em>308 F.3d 840, 845-46 (8th Cir.2002) (\u201c[N]o liberty interest of constitutional significance is implicated when \u2018the employer has alleged merely improper or inadequate performance, incompetence, neglect of duty or malfeasance.\u2019\u201d (citation omitted)). Assistant County Solicitor Coggins\u2019s statements likewise described the employees\u2019 conduct at the gift exchange as having been improper and did little, if anything, to add to the stigma that Brown brought upon himself with his behavior. As the District Court noted, \u201c[describing [Brown\u2019s] conduct as malfeasance due to its capacity to damage public confidence in the County\u2019s emergency response system adds little to the reputational injury Brown suffered as a result of the disclosure of the conduct itself.\u201d <em>Brown, </em>2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 35811 at *12. Thus, the District Court properly granted summary judgment to Montgomery County on Brown\u2019s due process claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-9\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-10\">For the reasons stated above, we will affirm.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b116-11\">. The District Court had jurisdiction over this action pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1331 and 1367. We have appellate jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b116-21\">. A March 21, 2008 article in the <em>Morning </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number><em>Call </em>newspaper did identify Brown by name, but by this time he had already made himself available to the news media. The County did not identify him for the press.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b117-18\">. Brown also asserted claims for invasion of privacy and defamation, but he has abandoned these claims and they are not a part of this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b118-6\">. Reading Commissioner Matthews\u2019 actual comments at the March 6th Board of Commissioners meeting in context reveals that the reference to \"malfeasance\u201d was not directed at Brown. Rather, the statement referred to the possibility that additional disciplinary action might be taken against other employees if they were found to have committed an act of malfeasance during the gift exchange.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
