N.Y. Thruway Auth., </em>584 F.3d 82, 88 (2d Cir.2009). Further, because Dibbs appears <em>pro se, </em>we construe his pleadings liberally to raise the strongest arguments they suggest. <em>See Hill v. Curcione, </em>657 F.3d 116, 122 (2d Cir.2011). In applying those principles here, we assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the facts and record of the prior proceedings, which we reference only as necessary to explain our decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-21\">After an independent review of the record, we are satisfied that the district court properly dismissed Dibbs\u2019s complaint seeking to challenge the constitutionality of New York Election Law \u00a7\u00a7 6-106, 6-124, and 6-158. Those provisions require political parties to select them nominees for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>Supreme Court Justice at a convention of delegates chosen by party members in a primary election. Under a liberal construction of his complaint, Dibbs appears to challenge those provisions, and the entire statutory scheme of which they are a part, on the ground that they violate his rights under the First and Fourteenth Amendments of the United States Constitution. The district court dismissed Dibbs\u2019s challenge in large part based on the decision of the United States Supreme Court in <em>New York State Bd. of Elections v. Lopez Torres, </em>552 U.S. 196, 128 S.Ct. 791, 169 L.Ed.2d 665 (2008), which upheld the constitutionality of the aforementioned statutory scheme and concluded that it did not violate the First Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-5\">Dibbs\u2019s attempt to distinguish <em>L\u00f3pez Torres </em>is unavailing. The Supreme Court\u2019s broad holding that New York\u2019s selection of judicial nominees by convention was constitutional, <em>see </em>552 U.S. at 206-07, 209, 128 S.Ct. 791, forecloses the First Amendment claim now asserted by Dibbs. Moreover, to the extent that Dibbs raises constitutional challenges that were not squarely addressed by the Supreme Court, such as his equal protection and due process arguments, his pleading, which rests on legal conclusions devoid of factual support, fails to \u201cstate a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.\u201d <em>See Ashcroft v. Iqbal, </em>556 U.S. 662, 677-78, 129 S.Ct. 1937, 173 L.Ed.2d 868 (2009) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b63-6\">Finally, we review the district court\u2019s denial of Dibbs\u2019s motion for leave to amend for abuse of discretion, \u201ckeeping in mind that leave to amend should be freely granted when \u2018justice so requires.\u2019 \u201d <em>Sista v. CDC Ixis N. Am., Inc., </em>445 F.3d 161, 177 (2d Cir.2006) (internal quotations marks omitted); <em>see also Sims v. Blot, </em>534 F.3d 117, 132 (2d Cir.2008) (explaining that \u201cabuse of discretion\u201d includes errors of law). We find no such abuse of discretion. Dibbs filed two proposed amended complaints, both of which the district court considered and neither of which alleged legally cognizable claims. The district court therefore reasonably denied his motion to amend on the basis of futility.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-8\">We have considered all of Dibbs\u2019s remaining arguments and find them to be without merit. Accordingly, we AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
