His counsel has moved to withdraw, and has filed a brief under <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), suggesting that the sentence is unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-19\">Upon careful review, we conclude that the sentence imposed by the district court \u2014 at the bottom of the properly calculated Guidelines range \u2014 is not unreasonable. <em>See United States v. Peck, </em>496 F.3d 885, 891 (8th Cir.2007) (sentence within properly calculated Guidelines range is cloaked in presumption of reasonableness, but presumption may be rebutted by reference to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors; defendant must show that district court failed to consider relevant factor that should have received significant weight, gave significant weight to improper or irrelevant factor, or considered only appropriate factors but nevertheless committed clear error of judgment).</p>\n<p id=\"b565-23\">Having reviewed the record independently under <em>Penson v. Ohio, </em>488 U.S. 75, 109 S.Ct. 346, 102 L.Ed.2d 300 (1988), we have found no nonfrivolous issues. Accordingly we affirm, and we grant counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b565-20\">. The Honorable Ortrie D. Smith, United States District Judge for the Western District of Missouri.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
