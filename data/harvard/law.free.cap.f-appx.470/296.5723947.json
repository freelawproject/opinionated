He argues that the immigration judge (IJ) committed error and abused his discretion by denying relief and that the BIA erred by affirming the IJ\u2019s determi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>nation that he failed to show that it was likely that he would face future torture in Pakistan. Irfan further contends that the evidence does not support the IJ\u2019s and BIA\u2019s finding that the harm that he suffered did not constitute persecution and torture. He argues that he was eligible for special rule cancellation of removal and that the decisions of the IJ and BIA are not supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-5\">On November 18, 2010, the BIA affirmed the IJ\u2019s decision and dismissed Ir-fan\u2019s appeal. Irfan did not file with this court a petition for review of the BIA\u2019s dismissal of his appeal. Rather, Irfan filed a motion with the BIA for reconsideration of the dismissal. On June 13, 2011, the BIA denied reconsideration. Irfan\u2019s petition for review was filed with this court on July 12, 2011. It is timely with respect to the BIA\u2019s denial of his motion for reconsideration, but it is not timely with respect to the BIA\u2019s dismissal of his appeal. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(1). Because Irfan did not file a timely petition for review of the BIA\u2019s November 18, 2010 decision that affirmed the IJ\u2019s decision and dismissed his appeal, this court lacks jurisdiction over that decision. <em>Stone v. INS, </em>514 U.S. 386, 405-06, 115 S.Ct. 1537, 131 L.Ed.2d 465 (1995); <em>Espinal v. Holder, </em>636 F.3d 703, 705 (5th Cir.2011); <em>Guevara v. Gonzales, </em>450 F.3d 173, 176 (5th Cir.2006). This court\u2019s jurisdiction therefore extends only to the BIA\u2019s June 13, 2011 denial of reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-6\">Irfan fails to analyze the BIA\u2019s reasons for denying his motion to reconsider, which the BIA provided in a clearly worded, succinct opinion. Rather than address the BIA\u2019s rationale, explain why the BIA\u2019s conclusions constitute error, and explain why the order constitutes an abuse of discretion, <em>see Chambers v. Mukasey, </em>520 F.3d 445, 448 (5th Cir.2008), Irfan\u2019s argument focuses on the IJ\u2019s decision and the BIA\u2019s rationale for dismissal of his appeal of the IJ\u2019s decision. Irfan fails to explain why reconsideration was warranted by the BIA. Irfan\u2019s failure to address the rationale set forth in the BIA\u2019s denial of his motion for reconsideration constitutes a waiver of the only issue that is before this court \u2014 whether the BIA abused its discretion by denying Irfan\u2019s motion for reconsideration. <em>See United States v. Scroggins, </em>599 F.3d 433, 447 (5th Cir.2010); Fed. R.App. P. 28(a)(9).</p>\n<p id=\"b325-8\">Irfan\u2019s petition for review is therefore DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b324-7\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
