Based on <em>Padilla v. Kentucky, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 1473, 176 L.Ed.2d 284 (2010), Ramos alleges ineffective assistance of counsel at the time that he pleaded guilty to a drug offense in 1992. Assuming for the sake of argument that <em>Padilla </em>has retroactive effect, Ramos has not shown that his counsel\u2019s representation at the time of his guilty plea was deficient under <em>Padilla.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b865-9\">In 1992, Ramos pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute marijuana, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 846 and 841(a)(1), and was sentenced to eighty-four months in prison. In March 2009, the Department of Homeland Security issued Ramos a Notice to Appear, and in March 2010, he was ordered to be deported. In March 2011, he sought post-conviction relief based on ineffective assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-10\">We review a district court\u2019s denial of a writ of error <em>coram nobis </em>for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Peter, </em>310 F.3d 709, 711 (11th Cir.2002). The All Writs Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1651(a), grants authority to federal courts to issue a writ of error <em>coram nobis. United States v. Mills, </em>221 F.3d 1201, 1203 (11th Cir.2000). The writ serves as a remedy to vacate a conviction once a petitioner has served his sentence and is no longer in custody, <em>Peter, </em>310 F.3d at 712, thereby allowing a petitioner to obtain relief from the persistent adverse legal consequences of a wrongful conviction, <em>id. </em>at 715-16.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-11\">Ramos contends that his guilty plea should be vacated under the Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision in <em>Padilla, </em>because his defense counsel failed to inform him of the potential adverse immigration consequences at the time he pleaded guilty. In <em>Padilla, </em>the Supreme Court applied <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984), to hold that, based on prevailing professional norms at the time of Padilla\u2019s guilty plea, his counsel\u2019s failure to advise him of the risk of deportation following a conviction for the charge at issue constituted constitutionally deficient representation. 130 S.Ct. at 1482-84.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-13\">In reaching this conclusion, the Supreme Court examined two critical developments in immigration law over the past two decades. First, in 1990, Congress eliminated the judicial recommendation against deportation (JRAD), a form of judicial relief during sentencing that had been previously available to noncitizens convicted of narcotics offenses. <em>See </em>Immigration Act of 1990, Pub.L. No. 101-649, \u00a7 505, 104 Stat. 4978, 5050 (1990); <em>Padilla, </em>130 S.Ct. at 1479-80. Second, in 1996, Congress removed the Attorney General\u2019s discretion to grant relief from deportation to immigrants convicted of aggravated felonies. <em>See </em>Illegal Immigration Reform &amp; Immigration Responsibility Act of 1996, Pub.L. No. 104-208, \u00a7 304, 110 Stat. 3009-546, 3009-594, 3009-597 (1996); <em>I.N.S. v. St. Cyr, </em>533 U.S. 289, 297, 121 S.Ct. 2271, 2277-78, 150 L.Ed.2d 347 (2001). The Supreme Court noted in <em>Padilla </em>that, \u201cif a noncitizen has committed a removable offense after the 1996 effective date of these amendments, his removal is practically inevitable.\u201d 130 S.Ct. at 1480. Professional legal norms adapted to the fact that \u201cthe deportation consequence\u201d of a guilty plea was \u201ctruly clear\u201d under this new regime. <em>Id. </em>at 1483. Thus, these legislative developments as reflected in professional norms defined the contours of the Sixth Amend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"838\">*838</page-number>ment right to effective assistance of counsel to include advising a criminal defendant of the risk of deportation following a guilty plea. <em>Id. </em>at 1480, 1482-84.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-4\">Here, Ramos pleaded guilty to his drug offense in 1992. His guilty plea, although it postdated the elimination of JRAD, predated the 1996 amendments that made it \u201cpractically inevitable\u201d he would be subject to deportation. <em>Id. </em>at 1480. Ramos has not otherwise shown that at the time of his guilty plea, professional norms had adapted to the developments in immigration law. Notably, he fails to cite a single source of professional legal norms at the time of his guilty plea suggesting that his counsel\u2019s representation was deficient. As such, we cannot say that the failure of Ramos\u2019s counsel to advise him of the immigration consequences of pleading guilty in 1992 amounted to ineffective assistance of counsel under <em>Padilla.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b866-5\">For the reasons stated, we AFFIRM the district court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
