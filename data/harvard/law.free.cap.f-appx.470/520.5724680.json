The driver, Duane Russell Conroy, threw a black bag out the window. The bag contained two ounces of meth and drug paraphernalia. Conroy pled guilty to possessing meth with intent to distribute, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1) and (b)(1)(B). Conroy qualified as a career offender; the advisory sentencing range was 262 to 327 months. Applying a 35 percent variance, the district court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> sentenced Conroy to 170 months\u2019 imprisonment. He appeals the sentence for procedural error and substantive unreasonableness. This court affirms.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-22\">Any procedural error is reviewed for plain error because Conroy did not object at sentencing. <em>United States v. Townsend, </em>618 F.3d <em>915, 918 (8th </em>Cir.2010) (requiring an obvious legal error affecting both a party\u2019s substantial rights and the fairness, integrity, or reputation of the judicial proceedings). Conroy says the district court did not properly account for his mental health or addiction history. However, the court explicitly noted those considerations and acknowledged reading Conroy\u2019s sentencing memorandum. Further, the court did not commit an obvious legal error when it mistakenly said Conroy had \u201cfive good chances in drug court.\u201d Conroy had five prior drug convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-23\">Conroy argues his sentence is greater than necessary because the district court failed to adequately weigh the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors. A sentence\u2019s substantive reasonableness is reviewed under a deferential abuse-of-discretion standard. <em>United States v. Feemster, </em>572 F.3d 455, 461 (8th Cir.2009) (en banc). A sentence within the advisory guidelines is presumed reasonable. <em>United States v. Underwood, </em>639 F.3d 1111, 1114 (8th Cir.2011). It is \u201cnearly inconceivable\u201d for the court to abuse its discretion when imposing a sentence below the advisory range. <em>United States v. Moore, </em>581 F.3d 681, 684 (8th Cir.2009). The district court did not abuse its discretion. It carefully accounted for Conroy\u2019s criminal history and mental health situation, the need for deterrence, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>and other available sentencing options. <em>See United States v. Bridges, </em>569 F.3d 374, 379 (8th Cir.2009) (granting \u201cwide latitude\u201d to the court in its evaluation). Moreover, the court correctly categorized Conroy as a career offender. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4Bl.l(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b549-5\">The district court did not commit plain error or impose a substantively unreasonable sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-6\">The judgment of the district court is affirmed. <em>See </em>8th Cir. R. 47B.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b548-19\">. The Honorable John A. Jarvey, United States District Judge for the Southern District of Iowa.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
