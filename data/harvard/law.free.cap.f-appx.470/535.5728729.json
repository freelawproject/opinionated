On appeal, his counsel has moved to withdraw, and has filed a brief under <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), and Solis has filed pro se submissions. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-22\">In the <em>Anders </em>brief, counsel argues that the district court erred at sentencing by enhancing Solis\u2019s Guidelines range for playing an aggravating role in the offense. In his pro se submissions, Solis asserts that the enhancement was based on uncharged conduct, in violation of his constitutional rights. Solis is precluded from challenging the enhancement on appeal, however, because he withdrew his objection prior to sentencing. <em>See United States v. Thompson, </em>289 F.3d 524, 526-27 (8th Cir.2002). Even if his constitutional argument survives the withdrawal of his objection, the argument fails. <em>See United States v. Okai, </em>454 F.3d 848, 851 (8th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b563-23\">Solis also asks that his case be remanded for consideration of his eligibility for a fast-track program. But he did not raise any issue at sentencing about a fast-track program, and if he is raising the district court\u2019s failure to consider the matter <em>sua sponte </em>at sentencing as a mitigating sentencing factor or otherwise, the court did not plainly err. <em>Cf. United States v. Elodio-Benitez, </em>672 F.3d 584, 586 (8th Cir.2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b563-24\">Finally, having reviewed the record independently under <em>Penson v. Ohio, </em>488 U.S. 75, 109 S.Ct. 346, 102 L.Ed.2d 300 (1988), including the reasonableness of the sentence imposed, <em>see United States v. Feemster, </em>572 F.3d 455, 461 (8th Cir.2009) (en banc), we find no nonfrivolous issue. Accordingly, we grant counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw, and we affirm the judgment.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b563-20\">. The Honorable Richard G.
