Cowper appeals, asserting that his within-Guidelines sentence is unreasonable. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-26\">In 2003, Cowper pled guilty to possession with intent to distribute cocaine base, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1), and was sentenced to 84 months\u2019 imprisonment followed by 5 years\u2019 supervised release. Due to a subsequent reduction in his term of imprisonment, Cowper\u2019s term of supervised release commenced on July 3, 2008. The conditions of his supervised release provided that he may not commit a federal, local, or state crime, or associate with persons engaged in criminal activity. In December 2010, the United States Probation Office submitted a petition alleging that Cowper violated these terms. Among other claims, the probation office alleged that Cowper had been arrested and indicted for his role in a money laundering conspiracy, and recommended that Cowper\u2019s supervised release be revoked due to such criminal activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-4\">In September 2011, during Cowper\u2019s supervised release revocation hearing, Cowper admitted that he violated the terms of his supervised release and notified the court that he had already pled guilty to the substantive money laundering offense in a separate federal case. Cowper notified the court that he would be sentenced in that case the following month and that he faced an advisory Guidelines range of 33 to 41 months\u2019 imprisonment on that charge. The district court accepted Cowper\u2019s admission and calculated his advisory Guidelines range for the supervised release violation at 18 to 24 months\u2019 imprisonment. Cowper asserted that a below-Guidelines sentence was appropriate because he was already facing a significant sentence on the substantive money laundering conviction and he had maintained steady employment while on release. In response, the government argued that a within-Guidelines sentence was appropriate due to the seriousness of the violation as well as Cowper\u2019s significant criminal history. The district court, citing the sentencing factors under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), sentenced Cowper to 18 months\u2019 imprisonment, emphasizing the seriousness of the violation and the relatively short sentence Cowper served for his original drug trafficking conviction. The court concluded that the sentence would reflect the seriousness of the violation and the need for punishment and deterrence.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-6\">Cowper claims the district court erred by failing to adequately consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and by not giving greater weight to the fact that he faced a significant sentence on his substantive money laundering conviction. <em>See United States v. Feemster, </em>572 F.3d 455, 461 (8th Cir.2009) (en banc) (explaining that procedural error includes failing to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, and a court abuses its discretion if it fails to consider a relevant factor that should have received significant weight or commits a clear error of judgment while weighing appropriate factors). We perceive no such errors on this record. The district court expressly cited the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, considered the parties\u2019 arguments, and emphasized the seriousness of Cowper\u2019s violation and the need for punishment and deterrence. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(1), (2). We do not require a mechanical recitation of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and, on this record, it is clear the district court considered the factors while determining Cowper\u2019s sentence. <em>Feemster, 572 </em>F.3d at 461. Likewise, we discern no error of judgment in the court\u2019s weighing of appropriate sentencing factors or its decision to deny Cowper\u2019s request for a downward variance. While Cowper claims his 18-month sentence is substantively unreasonable, he has failed to rebut the presumption of reasonableness we accord his within-Guidelines sentence. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b562-7\">We affirm.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b561-29\">.
