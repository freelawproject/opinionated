We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-20\">We review the interpretation and application of the Sentencing Guidelines <em>de novo </em>and related findings of fact for clear error. <em>United States v. Doe, </em>661 F.3d 550, 565 (11th Cir.2011) (obstruction of justice); <em>United States v. Gupta, </em>572 F.3d 878, 887 (11th Cir.2009) (acceptance of responsibility). The finding that a defendant has not accepted responsibility for his criminal conduct is \u201c \u2018entitled to great deference on review and should not be disturbed unless it is without foundation.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Knight, </em>562 F.3d 1314, 1322 (11th Cir.2009) (quoting <em>United States v. Davis, </em>878 F.2d 1299, 1301 (11th Cir.1989)).</p>\n<p id=\"b880-21\">The district court did not err when it enhanced Tilcock\u2019s sentence for obstructing justice nor when it denied his request for a reduction of his sentence for acceptance of responsibility. During a pre-sentence hearing, Tilcock testified that he had identified Jacob Mason as the person who had made the undercover purchases that led to the charges against him. Tilcock admitted that he had called Mason and had said \u201cIf you\u2019re still living in Tallahassee, I\u2019ll find you and beat your ass\u201d; \u201cI\u2019ll come after that whore of yours too\u201d; and \u201cI\u2019ve got a pistol waiting too.\u201d Mason testified that he also had received text <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"853\">*853</page-number>messages from Tilcock that stated, \u201cWhen I see you, I\u2019ll get you.\u201d The district court did not clearly err in finding that Tilcock had intended to threaten Mason, <em>see id. </em>\u00a7 3C1.1 cmt n. 4(A), and that Tilcock \u201cha[d] not accepted responsibility for his criminal conduct,\u201d <em>id. </em>\u00a7 3E1.I cmt. n. 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-5\">We AFFIRM Tilcock\u2019s sentence.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
