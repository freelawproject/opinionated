We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review de novo, <em>Leong v. Potter, </em>347 F.3d 1117, 1123 (9th Cir.2003), and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-6\">The district court properly granted summary judgment on Strong\u2019s race discrimination claim because Strong failed to raise a genuine dispute of material fact as to whether he performed his job satisfactorily, whether similarly situated individuals outside his protected class were treated more favorably, or whether Merrill Lynch\u2019s legitimate, nondiscriminatory reasons for its actions were pretextual. <em>See id. </em>at 1124-25; <em>see also Brooks v. City of San Mateo, </em>229 F.3d 917, 923 (9th Cir.2000) (same analysis applies to Title VII and FEHA claims).</p>\n<p id=\"b701-7\">' The district court properly granted summary judgment on Strong\u2019s racial harassment claim because Strong failed to raise a genuine dispute of material fact as to whether the alleged conduct was because of his race or was sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the conditions of his employment. <em>See Vasquez v. County of Los Angeles, </em>349 F.3d 634, 642-44 (9th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b701-8\">Strong\u2019s remaining contentions are unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b701-11\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
