Bell, </em>447 Fed.Appx. 116, 118 (11th Cir.2011) (unpublished). Before our mandate issued on January 10, 2012, the district court entered an order dismissing the case. That order is the subject of this appeal, and the district court did not have jurisdiction to enter it. <em>See Zaklama v. Mount Sinai Med. Ctr., </em>906 F.2d 645, 649 (11th Cir.1990) (\u201c[A] district court ... is without <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"859\">*859</page-number>jurisdiction to rule in a case that is on appeal, despite a decision by this court, until the mandate has issued.\u201d). The district court\u2019s order is VACATED, and the case is REMANDED. If the district court\u2019s view of the matter has not changed in the interim, it may reenter its order after the mandate issues for this decision.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
