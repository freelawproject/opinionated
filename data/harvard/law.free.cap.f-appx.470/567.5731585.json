We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-25\">Pough first contends that he is entitled to equitable tolling. However, Pough has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>failed to establish that his petition was untimely because of \u201cextraordinary circumstances\u201d beyond his control. <em>See Spitsyn v. Moore, </em>345 F.3d 796, 799 (9th Cir.2003). The district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Pough an evidentiary hearing. <em>See Schriro v. Landrigan, </em>550 U.S. 465, 474-75, 127 S.Ct. 1933, 167 L.Ed.2d 836 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b596-4\">Pough also contends that he is entitled to statutory tolling. This argument fails because his state court habeas petitions were filed either before the limitations period began or after it had expired. No state court petition was pending during the time the federal habeas statute of limitations was running. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(2); <em>Ferguson v. Palmateer, </em>321 F.3d 820, 823 (9th Cir.2003) (a state petition does not reinitiate a limitations period that ended before the petition was filed).</p>\n<p id=\"b596-5\">Pough\u2019s motion to amend his opening brief for clarity, filed on September 28, 2011, is denied. Pough\u2019s notice of motion for release on his own recognizance pending appeal, filed on November 4, 2011, is denied as moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b595-26\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
