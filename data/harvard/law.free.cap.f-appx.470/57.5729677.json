June 6, 2011). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-20\">We review the BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to reopen for abuse of discretion. <em>See Jian Hui Shao v. Mukasey, </em>546 F.3d 138, 168-69 (2d Cir.2008). An alien must file a motion to reopen within 90 days of the agency\u2019s final administrative decision. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(C)(i); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(2). Soumalia\u2019s motion to reopen was indisputably untimely because it was filed more than six years after his order of removal became final. <em>See 8 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(C)(i); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b85-23\">Moreover, the BIA did not err in declining to equitably toll the time period for filing Soumalia\u2019s motion to reopen based on his ineffective assistance of counsel claim. In order to warrant equitable tolling, even assuming that a movant demonstrated that prior counsel was ineffective, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>an alien is required to demonstrate \u201cdue diligence\u201d in pursuing his claim during \u201cboth the period of time before the ineffective assistance of counsel was or should have been discovei\u2019ed and the period from that point until the motion to reopen is filed.\u201d <em>Rashid v. Mukasey, </em>533 F.3d 127, 131 (2d Cir.2008); <em>see also Cekic v. INS, </em>435 F.3d 167, 170 (2d Cir.2006). The BIA did not err in finding that Soumalia failed to demonstrate that he exercised due diligence because he did not assert before the BIA that he took any actions to pursue his case from 2007, when he discovered that his removal proceedings were closed, to 2010, when he hired an attorney to file his motion to reopen. <em>See Jian Hua Wang v. BIA, </em>508 F.3d 710, 715 (2d Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b86-4\">We may not consider, or remand for the BIA to consider, Soumalia\u2019s assertion and supporting evidence that he exercised due diligence in 2007 by hiring a third attorney who provided him with ineffective assistance of counsel because he did not raise this issue or present this evidence to the BIA. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(A) (providing that \u201cthe court of appeals shall decide the petition only on the administrative record on which the order of removal is based\u201d); <em>see also Xiao Xing Ni v. Gonzales, </em>494 F.3d 260, 269-70 (2d Cir.2007) (holding that any inherent power to remand \u201cshould not\u201d be exercised when \u201c[i] the basis for the remand is an instruction to consider documentary evidence that was not in the record before the BIA; and [ii] the agency regulations set forth procedures to reopen a case before the BIA for the taking of additional evidence.\u201d); <em>Lin Zhong v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>480 F.3d 104, 124 (2d Cir.2007) (recognizing that, although issue exhaustion is not a jurisdictional requirement, failure to exhaust specific issues is mandatory).</p>\n<p id=\"b86-6\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. As we have completed our review, any stay of removal that the Court previously granted in this petition is VACATED, and any pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot. Any pending request for oral argument in this petition is DENIED in accordance with Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 34(a)(2), and Second Circuit Local Rule 34.1(b).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
