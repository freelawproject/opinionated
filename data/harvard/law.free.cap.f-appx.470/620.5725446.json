We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for abuse of discretion, <em>Iturribarria v. INS, </em>321 F.3d 889, 894 (9th Cir.2003), and we deny the petition, for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-12\">The BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying Kauris fourth motion to reopen as numerically-barred and untimely where the motion was filed over 12 years after the BIA\u2019s final order, <em>see </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(2), and Kaur failed to establish changed circumstances in India to qualify for the regulatory exception to the time and number limit for filing motions to reopen, <em>see </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(e)(3)(ii); <em>see also Malty v. Ashcroft, </em>381 F.3d 942, 945 (9th Cir.2004) (\u201cThe critical question is ... whether circumstances have changed sufficiently that a petitioner who previously did not have a legitimate claim for asylum now has a well-founded fear of future persecution.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b649-17\">We reject Kauris contentions that the BIA failed to consider and address her supporting evidence. <em>See Najmabadi v. Holder, </em>597 F.3d 983, 990-91 (9th Cir.2010). We also reject Kauris contention that the time limitation for filing a motion to reopen does not apply to her application for relief under the Convention Against Torture. <em>See 8 </em>C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.18(b)(2)(i).</p>\n<p id=\"b649-18\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b649-28\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9 th Cir.
