We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-5\">Niles contends that the district court erred in estimating the drug quantity attributable to him because the estimate was based on allegedly unreliable testimony from witnesses Linda Selph and Jonathan Rodriguez. The district court did not err because it applied the correct burden of proof, used reliable evidence, and erred on the side of caution. <em>See United States v. Alvarez, </em>358 F.3d 1194, 1212-13 (9th Cir.2004) (testimony of co-conspirators given under oath and subject to cross-examination has sufficient indicia of reliability to support calculation\u2019s probable accuracy); <em>United States v. Culps, </em>300 F.3d 1069, 1076-77 (9th Cir.2002) (multiplier method is one permissible method of approximating drug quantity).</p>\n<p id=\"b595-6\">Niles also contends that his sentence is substantively unreasonable. In light of the totality of the circumstances and the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) sentencing factors, Niles\u2019 within-Guidelines sentence is substantively reasonable. <em>See Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b595-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b594-28\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9 th Cir.
