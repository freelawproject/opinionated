We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-9\">Suarez-Aguilar contends that his sentence is substantively unreasonable because the district court did not vary downward from the Guidelines range based on the \u201cstaleness\u201d of his prior conviction, which served as the predicate for a 16-level enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A). He also contends that the district court erred by failing to vary downward based on a proposed amendment to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b) that was pending at the time he was sentenced.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-10\">In light of the totality of the circumstances, including the seriousness of Suarez-Aguilar\u2019s prior conviction and his multiple prior deportations, the within-Guidelines sentence is not substantively unreasonable. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a); <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). Furthermore, the district court\u2019s failure to grant the requested variance to reflect the proposed amendment to the Guidelines did not result in a substantively unreasonable sentence. <em>See United States v. Ruiz-Apolonio, </em>657 F.3d 907, 918 (9th Cir.2011) (\u201cThat the Commission has promulgated a not-yet-adopted amendment that is very likely to be adopted and that would result in reduced Guidelines ranges does not render a district court\u2019s failure to grant a variance substantively unreasonable.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b593-14\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b593-12\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
