Additionally, the IJ denied John\u2019s motion for termination or stay of the removal proceedings, which was grounded in John\u2019s argument that his application for naturalization was wrongly denied. The IJ\u2019s denial of John\u2019s motion was based on the conclusions that the IJ lacked jurisdiction to terminate the proceedings and that John had not shown good cause to stay them. The Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) likewise concluded that it lacked jurisdiction to terminate the proceedings and dismissed John\u2019s appeal. We are now presented with John\u2019s petition for review of the BIA\u2019s decision. John does not, however, dispute the BIA\u2019s determination that it lacked jurisdiction to terminate his removal proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-22\">Rather, in his filings with this court, John contends that his due process rights were infringed in connection with the denial of his application for naturalization and that he should receive naturalization because the INS did not act properly with respect to this application. John has not shown error in connection with the BIA\u2019s decision. <em>See Zhu v. Gonzales, </em>493 F.3d 588, 593-94 (5th Cir.2007); <em>see also In re Hidalgo, </em>24 I. &amp; N. Dec. 103, 105-07 (BIA 2007), 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1239.2(f). Consequently, his petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b430-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
