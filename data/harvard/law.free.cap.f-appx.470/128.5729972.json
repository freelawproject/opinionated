Stoyanov appeals the district court\u2019s order granting Defendants\u2019 summary judgment motion on his several federal and state law claims against them, and denying his motions for default and for leave to file a surreply. We have reviewed the record and find no reversible error. Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s order. <em>See Stoyanov v. Behrle, </em>No. 1:07-cv-01863-WMN, 2011 WL 4397492 (D.Md. Sept. 20, 2011). We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-11\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
