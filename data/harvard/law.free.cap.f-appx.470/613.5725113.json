We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence factual findings. <em>Farah v. Ashcroft, </em>348 F.3d 1153, 1156 (9th Cir.2003). We deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-14\">Substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s denial of Singh\u2019s CAT claim because it is based on the same statements the agency found not credible, and the record does not otherwise compel the finding that it is more likely than not he would be tortured if returned to India. <em>See id. </em>at 1156-57. In addition, the record belies Singh\u2019s contention that the agency disregarded his supporting evidence. We note that the IJ did not admit Exhibit H into the record, and Singh did not challenge that decision. Accordingly, Singh\u2019s CAT claim fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-15\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"A0o2\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
