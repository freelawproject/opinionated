Campbell appeals the district court\u2019s orders excluding her expert witness, dismissing her complaint, and denying her motion to alter or amend judgment. We have reviewed the record and find no reversible error. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-16\">We review the district court\u2019s exclusion of a plaintiffs expert witness for an abuse of discretion. <em>Carr v. Deeds, </em>453 F.3d 593, 601 (4th Cir.2006). Rule 26(a)(2) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure imposes specific requirements for the disclosure of expert testimony during the discovery period. A plaintiff must disclose her expert by the date provided by a court\u2019s pretrial order. Fed.R.Civ.P. 26(a)(2)(C) (2010). In addition, an expert witness\u2019s report must contain:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b183-17\">(i) a complete statement of all opinions the witness will express and the basis and reasons for them; (ii) the facts or data considered by the witness in forming them; (iii) any exhibits that will be used to summarize or support them; (iv) the witness\u2019s qualifications, including a list of all publications authored in the previous 10 years; (v) a list of all other cases in which, during the previous 4 years, the witness testified as an expert at trial or by deposition; and (vi) a statement of the compensation to be paid for the study and testimony in the case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b184-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>Fed.R.Civ.P. 26(a)(2)(B). Thus, \u201cthe expert report should be written in a manner that reflects the testimony the expert witness is expected to give at trial.\u201d <em>Sharpe v. United States, </em>230 F.R.D. 452, 458 (E.D.Va.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b184-4\">Pursuant to Rule 37(c)(1), a party who fails to properly designate an expert witness as required by Rule 26(a) may not use the expert at trial, \u201cunless the failure was substantially justified or harmless.\u201d Fed. R.Civ.P. 37(c)(1). The party facing sanctions carries the burden of showing that the failure to comply with Rule 26(a) was either substantially justified or harmless. <em>Carr, </em>453 F.3d at 602. In determining whether a party\u2019s failure to properly designate an expert was \u201csubstantially justified or harmless,\u201d a court should balance: (1) the surprise to the party against whom the evidence would be offered; (2) the ability of that party to cure the surprise; (3) the extent to which allowing the explanation would disrupt the trial; (4) the importance of the evidence; and (5) the nondisclosing party\u2019s explanation for its failure to disclose the evidence. <em>S. States Rack &amp; Fixture, Inc. v. Sherwin-Williams Co., </em>318 F.3d 592, 597 (4th Cir.2003). The district court has \u201cbroad discretion to determine whether a nondisclosure of evidence is substantially justified or harmless.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b184-5\">Campbell filed her expert designation, identifying Dr. Moffatt as her proposed expert, on December 7, 2010, five days after the deadline set forth in the district court\u2019s scheduling order. The district court found Campbell\u2019s expert report deficient, as Dr. Moffatt failed to delineate the applicable standard of care, discuss the issue of causation, explain the factual basis for his conclusions, or reveal the records that he reviewed, as required by Rule 26(a). The district court also held that Campbell failed to show her failure was \u201csubstantially justified or harmless,\u201d thereby excluding her expert witness pursuant to Rule 37(c)(1). Having excluded Campbell\u2019s only proposed expert witness, the district court granted the Government\u2019s motion for summary judgment, and denied Campbell\u2019s subsequent motion to alter or amend its judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-7\">On appeal, Campbell argues that the district court erred by failing to consider less drastic sanctions, such as sanctioning her attorney. However, Campbell\u2019s argument is misplaced; as we have previously held, and as the language of Rule 37(c)(1) evidences, the Federal Rules impose an \u201cautomatic sanction\u201d of exclusion of a party\u2019s expert witness for failure to adhere to the expert witness requirements set forth in Rule 26(a). <em>See Southern States, </em>318 F.3d at 592 n. 2 (\u201cThe Rule 37(c) advisory committee notes emphasize that the automatic sanction of exclusion provides a strong inducement for disclosure of material that the disclosing party would expect to use as evidence.\u201d) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Therefore, the district court did not abuse its discretion in failing to con-' sider less drastic sanctions than exclusion of Campbell\u2019s expert witness, as Rule 37(c) requires exclusion unless the party establishes substantial justification or harmlessness.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-8\">Campbell next asserts that the district court erroneously applied the factors set forth in <em>Southern States </em>to determine whether Campbell\u2019s failure was \u201csubstantially justified or harmless.\u201d In an attempt to justify the deficiency of her December 7 report, Campbell argues that the Government\u2019s \u201chide the ball tactics\u201d prevented her from preparing an adequate expert designation. With respect to the surprise to the defendant, Campbell asserts that, although Dr. Moffatt\u2019s December 7 report did not address the standard of care or the issue of causation, the Gov<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>ernment could \u201cinfer\u201d these requirements from his report. Further, Campbell argues, any surprise suffered by the Government was cured by Campbell\u2019s January 14, 2011 supplement, which included a new report from Dr. Moffatt and fifty-seven pages of exhibits.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-5\">As the district court correctly found, however, Campbell\u2019s arguments do not establish that her failure to designate an expert witness was \u201csubstantially justified or harmless.\u201d Although Campbell correctly notes the importance of her expert witness, as her medical malpractice case hinged upon his testimony, the other <em>Southern States </em>factors weigh against Campbell. The surprise suffered by the Government due to the deficiency of Campbell\u2019s December 7 report was great; pursuant to Rule 26(b)(4)(A), the Government could not depose Dr. Moffatt until Campbell provided an adequate expert report. At the time of the motion <em>in limine </em>hearing, trial was scheduled to begin in less than thirty days, and deposition of Campbell\u2019s expert witness had not yet occurred. As this court has previously emphasized, \u201cA party that fails to provide [expert] disclosures unfairly inhibits its opponent\u2019s ability to properly prepare, unnecessarily prolongs litigation, and undermines the district court\u2019s management of the case.\u201d <em>Saudi v. Northrop Grumman Corp., </em>427 F.3d 271, 278-79 (4th Cir.2005) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Further, although Campbell asserts that she was unable to prepare an adequate expert designation due to the Government\u2019s refusal to provide meaningful discovery responses, counsel for Campbell candidly admitted to the district court that her failure to properly designate an expert witness in compliance with Rule 26(a) was her own mistake, not attributable to the Government\u2019s wrongdoing.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-6\">Moreover, Campbell\u2019s January 14 supplement did not serve to \u201ccure\u201d the deficiencies of her original report. Although Campbell did not obtain court leave to file her January 14, 2011 supplement, more than a month after the December 2, 2010 deadline, Campbell contends that her supplement was properly before the court because she was under a \u201ccontinuing duty\u201d pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 26(e)(1) to supplement her December 7 report. However, Campbell miscomprehends the Federal Rules; Rule 26(e) envisions supplementation \u201cto add additional or corrective information.\u201d <em>Sharpe, </em>230 F.R.D. at 462. \u201cTo construe [Rule 26(e) ] supplementation to apply whenever a party wants to bolster or submit additional expert opinions would [wreak] havoc in docket control and amount to unlimited expert opinion preparation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Because Campbell\u2019s January 14 supplement did not simply add or correct information, but rather attempted to recast Dr. Moffatt\u2019s initial opinions so as to comply with the requirements of Rule 26(a), it does not fall within the bounds of Rule 26(e)(1). Thus, Campbell failed to establish that her failure to designate an expert witness was \u201csubstantially justified or harmless,\u201d as required by Rule 37(C)(1). Accordingly, the district court did not abuse its discretion in excluding Campbell\u2019s expert witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-7\">The district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment is reviewed de novo. <em>Jennings v. Univ. of North Carolina, </em>482 F.3d 686, 694 (4th Cir.2007) (en banc). Summary judgment shall be granted \u201cif the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(a). \u201cWhere the record taken as a whole could not lead a rational trier of fact to find for the non-moving party, there is no genuine issue for trial.\u201d <em>Scott v. Harris, </em>550 U.S. 372, 380, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>127 S.Ct. 1769, 167 L.Ed.2d 686 (2007) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b186-4\">Virginia law, which governs Campbell\u2019s claim,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> requires a plaintiff suing for medical malpractice to demonstrate: (1) the applicable standard of care; (2) breach of that standard of care; and (3) that the breach proximately caused the plaintiffs injuries. <em>Parker v. United States, </em>475 F.Supp.2d 594, 598 (E.D.Va.2007). Absent the rare case in which the alleged negligent act or omission is clearly within the common knowledge of laymen, \u201cexpert testimony is ordinarily necessary\u201d to establish these elements. <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Without an expert witness, Campbell was unable to establish a prima facie case of medical malpractice. As there was no genuine dispute as to any material fact, the district court did not err in granting the Government summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-5\">Finally, we review the denial of a Fed.R.Civ.P. 59 motion to alter or amend a judgment for abuse of discretion. <em>Sloas v. CSX Transp., </em>Inc., 616 F.3d 380, 388 (4th Cir.2010). The district court \u201cnecessarily abuses its discretion when it makes an error of law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Wolfe v. Johnson, </em>565 F.3d 140, 160 (4th Cir.2009)). \u201cThere are three grounds for amending an earlier judgment: (1) to accommodate an intervening change in controlling law; (2) to account for new evidence not available at trial; or (3) to correct a clear error of law or prevent manifest injustice.\u201d <em>Pacific Ins. Co. v. Am. Nat\u2019l Fire Ins. Co., </em>148 F.3d 396, 403 (4th Cir.1998) (citation omitted). On appeal, Campbell fails to highlight a change in controlling law, present new evidence, or identify a clear error of law. Accordingly, we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Campbell\u2019s motion to alter or amend judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-10\">We affirm the judgment of the district court. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-11\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b186-6\"> As the alleged negligence occurred in Virginia, Campbell\u2019s lawsuit is governed by Virginia law. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1346(b) (indicating that FTCA claims are governed by the \u201claw of the place where the act or omission occurred\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
