The District Court sentenced him to 180 months\u2019 imprisonment. Cruz appeals his conviction and sentence. He argues that the Court erred in denying his motion to suppress certain physical evidence, and also requests relief under the Fair Sentencing Act of 2010 (\u201cFSA\u201d), Pub.L. No. 111-220, \u00a7 2, 124 Stat. 2372. We affirm Cruz\u2019s conviction and remand to the Court for resentencing.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b121-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b121-5\">Because we write solely for the parties, we recite only those facts necessary to our decision. Detectives from the Berks County Police Department, acting pursuant to a warrant, arrested Cruz near the residence they believed was his. On arresting Cruz, they requested his consent to search the residence. Cruz stated that he did not live there, but that his girlfriend, Peggy Espada, and children resided there and were inside. Espada freely and expressly consented to a search of the residence. She also identified an unlocked, zipped suitcase located in a doorless closet, a jacket draped over it, another jacket, and a lockbox as belonging to Cruz. The detectives seized these items, transported them to the police headquarters, and, after obtaining a search warrant, recovered the drugs and the weapon that were the bases of some of the charges against Cruz.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-6\">Cruz pled guilty after the District Court denied his motion to suppress the physical evidence recovered from Espada\u2019s residence. The Court sentenced him on September 8, 2010, after the enactment of the FSA, but before we held that the FSA\u2019s provisions apply to all defendants sentenced on or after August 3, 2010. <em>See United States v. Dixon, </em>648 F.3d 195 (3d Cir.2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b121-7\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"AW-\">A. Motion to Suppress</p>\n<p id=\"b121-8\">We \u201creview the district court\u2019s denial of [a] motion to suppress for clear error as to the underlying facts, but exercise plenary review as to its legality in light of the court\u2019s properly found facts.\u201d <em>United States v. Kennedy, </em>638 F.3d 159, 163 (3d Cir.2011) (quoting <em>United States v. Silveus, </em>542 F.3d 993, 999 (3d Cir.2008)) (alteration in original).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b121-11\">Seizure of personal property is <em>\u201cper se </em>unreasonable within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment unless it is accomplished pursuant to a judicial warrant issued upon probable cause....\u201d <em>United States v. Place, </em>462 U.S. 696, 701, 103 S.Ct. 2637, 77 L.Ed.2d 110 (1983). There are, however, well-established exceptions to the warrant requirement, one of which is consent. <em>Schneckloth v. Bustamante, </em>412 U.S. 218, 219, 93 S.Ct. 2041, 36 L.Ed.2d 854 (1973). Cruz argues that Espada did not have authority to consent to the seizure of his belongings. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-12\">Consent by a third party is valid if there exists such \u201ccommon authority over or other sufficient relationship to the premises or effects sought to be inspected.\u201d <em>United States v. Matlock, </em>415 U.S. 164, 171, 94 S.Ct. 988, 39 L.Ed.2d 242 (1974). Common authority rests not on pure ownership, but rather on the \u201cmutual use of the property by persons generally having joint access or control....\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 172 n. 7, 94 S.Ct. 988. Espada was the resident of the searched premises, while Cruz was a temporary guest who admitted that he had no control over the residence. In leaving the residence with his belongings still in the bedroom, unlocked and exposed in a door-less closet, Cruz assumed the risk that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>Espada would consent to a search of her residence. We thus affirm his conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-4\">B. Sentence</p>\n<p id=\"b122-5\">We review the District Court\u2019s legal conclusions regarding the United States Sentencing Guidelines <em>de novo. United States v. Blackmon, </em>557 F.3d 113, 118 (3d Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b122-6\">Cruz argues that the Court should have applied the FSA based on our decision in <em>Dixon </em>because he was sentenced after August 3, 2010. We note that Cruz failed to raise this argument to us in his opening brief, and that he raised it only after the Government\u2019s suggestion and consent. It is well established that failure to raise an argument in an opening brief is a waiver of that issue on appeal. <em>United States v. Pelullo, </em>399 F.3d 197, 222 (3d Cir.2005). We nonetheless consider the FSA argument because we find this instance to be an \u201cextraordinary circumstance.\u201d <em>United States v. Albertson, </em>645 F.3d 191, 195 (3d Cir.2011). The Government concedes that the FSA should be applied here. In addition, failing to consider the application of the FSA would result in a miscarriage of justice based on our holding in <em>Dixon </em>that \u201cthe FSA requires application of the new mandatory minimum sentencing provisions to all defendants sentenced on or after August 3, 2010, regardless of when the offense conduct occurred,\u201d particularly given that the application of the FSA will reduce Cruz\u2019s mandatory minimum sentence. <em>Dixon, </em>648 F.3d at 203.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b122-8\">Because Cruz\u2019s sentence was imposed by the District Court on September 8, 2010, we apply our holding in <em>Dixon. </em>Thus we vacate the sentence and remand so that Cruz may be resentenced in accordance with the FSA.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-9\">For these reasons, we affirm Cruz\u2019s conviction, vacate the District Court\u2019s sentence, and remand the case for resentencing consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b120-10\">. The District Court had jurisdiction under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3231. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(a).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b121-9\">. As an initial matter, the Government argues that Cruz lacks standing to object to the search of Espada's residence because he did not live there and was only an occasional visitor. Cruz had no expectation of privacy in Espada\u2019s residence at the time of the search. <em>See Minnesota v. Olson, </em>495 U.S. 91, 110 S.Ct. 1684, 109 L.Ed.2d 85 (1990); <em>United States v. Mosley, </em>454 F.3d 249 (3d Cir.2006). However, he had a reasonable expectation of privacy in the items that Espada identified as his. <em>See Rakas v. Illinois, </em>439 U.S. 128, 99 S.Ct. 421, 58 L.Ed.2d 387 (1978).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b122-7\">. Cruz\u2019s sentence included a mandatory minimum penalty of 120 months based on the crack-cocaine offense. Under the FSA, based on the grams of crack cocaine involved, this offense does not carry a mandatory minimum. <em>See Dixon, </em>648 F.3d at 197. His sentence also must be reconsidered in light of the corresponding amendment to the Sentencing Guidelines regarding crack-cocaine offenses, effective November 1, 2010, which applies retroactively effective November 1, 2011. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(c) (including Amendment 750 to the Guidelines, which altered the drug quantity tables based on the FSA, in the list of amendments that are given retroactive effect).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
