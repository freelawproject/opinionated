Chay asserted that his detention by ICE may have violated due process by failing to comply with the mandate of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231 and the holding in <em>Zadvydas v. Davis, </em>533 U.S. 678, 121 S.Ct. 2491, 150 L.Ed.2d 653 (2001). Chay sought to challenge the order reinstating his removal and asserted that a new Notice to Appear should be issued and a removal hearing held before he was removed from the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-20\">The district court determined that the REAL ID Act of 2005 divested federal district courts of jurisdiction over \u00a7 2241 habeas corpus petitions that 'attacked removal orders and sua sponte dismissed Chay\u2019s petition for lack of jurisdiction pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(C) and (a)(5). Chay filed a postjudgment motion, arguing that the REAL ID Act is unconstitutional. The district court did not address Chay\u2019s arguments but instead denied the motion for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-21\">Chay\u2019s sole challenge to the district court\u2019s determination that it lacked jurisdiction over his \u00a7 2241 claims is that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>REAL ID Act is unconstitutional and, therefore, cannot eliminate habeas corpus actions under \u00a7 2241. Chay contends, as he did in his \u00a7 2241 petition, that his detention was unlawful in light of \u00a7 1231 and <em>Zadvydas.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b435-5\">\u201cThis Court must examine the basis of its jurisdiction, on its own motion, if necessary.\u201d <em>Mosley v. Cozby, </em>813 F.2d 659, 660 (5th Cir.1987). \u201cA moot case presents no Article III case or controversy, and a court has no constitutional jurisdiction to resolve the issues it presents.\u201d <em>Goldin v. Bartholow, </em>166 F.3d 710, 717 (5th Cir.1999). Events occurring after a district court\u2019s entry of judgment may render an appeal moot. <em>See Bailey v. Southerland, </em>821 F.2d 277, 278-79 (5th Cir.1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b435-6\">Chay was removed from the United States on October 5, 2011, after the notice of appeal was filed in this case but before briefs were filed, and he does not challenge his removal. Even if the district court retained subject matter jurisdiction over Chay\u2019s \u00a7 2241 petition to the extent that it challenged the continued lawfulness of Chay\u2019s post-removal-order detention, and not an order of removal, <em>see Tran v. Mukasey, </em>515 F.3d 478, 485 (5th Cir.2008), any such challenge is now moot because Chay has been removed from the United States. <em>See Odus v. Ashcroft, </em>61 Fed. Appx. 121, 121 (5th Cir.2003); <em>Umanzor v. Lambert, </em>782 F.2d 1299, 1301 (5th Cir.1986). Chay does not assert that he raised another claim over which the district court would have had jurisdiction that has not been rendered moot by his removal, and we will not liberally construe his attorney-prepared brief to find one. <em>See Beasley v. McCotter, </em>798 F.2d 116, 118 (5th Cir.1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b435-10\">Accordingly, the appeal is DISMISSED AS MOOT.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b434-22\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
