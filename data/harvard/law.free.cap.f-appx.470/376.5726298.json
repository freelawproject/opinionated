He argues that the sentence is substantively unreasonable because it is greater than necessary to achieve the goals of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). He contends that the illegal-reentry guideline, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2, is not empirically based. He maintains, in reliance on <em>Kimbrough v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 85, 109-10, 128 S.Ct. 558, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007), that the presumption of reasonableness should not apply, but he concedes that his argument is foreclosed by <em>United States v. Duarte, </em>569 F.3d 528, 529-31 (5th Cir.2009); he raises it to preserve it for possible review by the Supreme Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-21\">He further argues that the age of his conviction, his subsequent work history and devotion to his family, and his motive for returning to the United States \u2014 to be with his family, in particular, his aging and ill parents \u2014 made a sentence within the guideline range greater than necessary to meet the goals. As he so concedes, his argument that the presumption of reasonableness should not apply to his sentence because \u00a7 2L1.2 lacks empirical support has been rejected by this court. <em>See id. </em>(rejecting the notion that this court should examine the empirical basis behind each guideline before applying the presumption of reasonableness); <em>see also United States v. Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d 357, 366-67 (5th Cir.2009) (holding that <em>Kimbrough </em>does not require discarding the presumption of reasonableness for sentences based on non-empirically-grounded guidelines).</p>\n<p id=\"b404-22\">Before imposing a sentence within the advisory guideline range, the district court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>heard the arguments of Olmos-Amador and his counsel concerning his reasons for reentering the United States. The district court considered Olmos-Amador\u2019s personal history and characteristics and the other statutory sentencing factors in \u00a7 3553(a), in particular Olmos-Amador\u2019s conviction for second degree murder. The within-guideline sentence is entitled to a presumption of reasonableness. <em>See Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 347, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007). Olmos-Amador\u2019s argument concerning his benign motive for reentry \u2014 to be with his aging and ill parents \u2014 fails to rebut that presumption. <em>See United States v. Gomez-Herrera, </em>523 F.3d 554, 565-66 (5th Cir.2008) (affirming sentence as reasonable where defendant\u2019s asserted motive for returning was to see his ailing father before he died).</p>\n<p id=\"b405-5\">Regarding his argument based on the age of his conviction, we have held that \u201cthe staleness of a prior conviction used in the proper calculation of a guidelines-range sentence does not render a sentence substantively unreasonable and does not destroy the presumption of reasonableness that attaches to such sentences.\u201d <em>United States v. Rodriguez, </em>660 F.3d 231, 234 (5th Cir.2011). Olmos-Amador has failed to show that the presumption should not apply.' The district court did not abuse its discretion in imposing a sentence within the range. <em>See Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 50-51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b405-6\">Accordingly, the judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b404-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
