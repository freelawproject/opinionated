On appeal, he argues that his sentence was procedurally unreasonable because the district court failed to adequately consider the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors, disregarded his arguments in favor of leniency and a sentence below the advisory Guidelines range, and failed to adequately explain the chosen sentence.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b834-15\">We review the reasonableness of a sentence under a deferential abuse of discretion standard of review. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 41, 128 S.Ct. 586, 591, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). The party challenging the sentence has the burden of establishing that the sentence was unreasonable. <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"807\">*807</page-number>784, 788 (11th Cir.2005). In reviewing the reasonableness of a sentence, we first consider whether the district court committed a procedural error, such as failing to calculate or improperly calculating the Guidelines range. <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. at 597. We also ensure that the district court treated the Guidelines as advisory, considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, did not select a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts, and adequately explained the chosen sentence. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b835-5\">\u201c[N]othing in <em>Booker </em>or elsewhere requires the district court to state on the record that it has explicitly considered each of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors or to discuss each of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors.\u201d <em>United States v. Scott, </em>426 F.3d 1324, 1329 (11th Cir.2005). The court\u2019s statement that it has considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors together with the parties\u2019 arguments is sufficient. <em>Id. </em>at 1330; <em>Talley, </em>431 F.3d at 786. Moreover, although \u201c[t]he sentencing judge should set forth enough to satisfy the appellate court that he has considered the parties\u2019 arguments and has a reasoned basis for exercising his own legal decision-making authority,\u201d the appropriateness of brevity or length of a district court\u2019s reasons for accepting or rejecting an argument depends upon the circumstances and leaves much to the court\u2019s own professional judgment. <em>See Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 356, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2468, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007). Where the context and the record make clear that the sentencing judge listened to each argument and found the circumstances insufficient to warrant a sentence lower than the Guidelines range, extensive explanation is not required. <em>Id. </em>at 358-59, 127 S.Ct. at 2469; <em>see also United States v. Amedeo, </em>487 F.3d 823, 833 (11th Cir.2007) (explaining failure to specifically analyze or discuss mitigating evidence under \u00a7 3553(a) does not necessarily \u201cmean[ ] that the court erroneously \u2018ignored\u2019 or failed to consider this evidence in determining [the defendant\u2019s] sentence\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b835-9\">Here, the record demonstrates that the court adequately considered the \u00a7 3553(a) sentencing factors and adequately explained its sentence.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Sedlock\u2019s counsel argued that the statutory factors regarding the seriousness of his offense, his age, his lack of any criminal history, and his low likelihood of recidivism weighed in favor of a below Guidelines range sentence. Subsequently, in explaining its sentence, the court stated that it had considered the advisory Guidelines and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, which alone is sufficient, and explicitly acknowledged that it had considered the parties\u2019 arguments at sentencing. Further, in concluding that a downward variance was not warranted, the district judge specifically rejected Sedlock\u2019s position with respect to the seriousness of the offense, exploring the length of Sedlock\u2019s involvement in the growing operation and discussing the fact that he had been growing marijuana as a for-profit business rather than for personal use. More extensive explanation was not required here, as the context and record make clear that the court listened to each argument and found the circumstances insufficient to warrant a below Guidelines range sentence. Accordingly, we affirm the sentence as reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-10\">AFFIRMED.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b834-8\">. Sedlock maintains that he is only challenging his sentence on procedural grounds. He nevertheless suggests that the district court placed unjustified reliance upon two \u00a7 3553(a) factors, the advisory Guidelines range and the seriousness of the offense, and that this is a symptom of an unreasonable sentence. In any event, on this record, we cannot say that the imposition of a low-end sentence of twenty-four months was substantively unreasonable.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b835-6\">. It is undisputed that the district court properly calculated Sedlock\u2019s Guidelines range, treated the Guidelines as advisory, and based the sentence on undisputed facts set forth in the presentence investigation report.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b835-13\">.
