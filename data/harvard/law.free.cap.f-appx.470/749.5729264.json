The IJ\u2019s decision denied asylum and withholding of removal.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> No reversible error has been shown; we dismiss the petition in part and deny it in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-20\">We review the BIA\u2019s decision in this case because the BIA did not expressly adopt the IJ\u2019s decision. <em>See Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1284 (11th Cir.2001). \u201cWhile we consider the BIA\u2019s interpretation of applicable statutes <em>de novo, </em>\u2018we are also obliged ... to defer to the BIA\u2019s interpretation ... if that interpretation is reasonable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation omitted). And we review fact determinations under the \u201chighly deferential substantial evidence test\u201d whereby we \u201cmust affirm the BIA\u2019s decision if it is \u2018supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u2019 \u201d <em>Adefemi v. Ashcroft, </em>386 F.3d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"751\">*751</page-number>1022, 1026-27 (11th Cir.2004) <em>(en banc). </em>We \u201cview the record evidence in the light most favorable to the ... decision and draw all reasonable inferences in favor of that decision.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1027. To reverse a fact determination, we must conclude \u201cthat the record not only supports reversal, but compels it.\u201d <em>Mendoza v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>327 F.3d 1283, 1287 (llth Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b779-5\">An alien may obtain asylum if he is a \u201crefugee,\u201d that is, a person unable or unwilling to return to his country of nationality \u201cbecause of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of\u2019 a protected ground, including political opinion and membership in a particular social group. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A), 1158(a)(1), (b)(1). The asylum applicant bears the burden of proving statutory \u201crefugee\u201d status with specific and credible evidence. <em>Forgue v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1282, 1287 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b779-6\">Castillo-Guerrero sought asylum and withholding of removal based on his membership in a particular social group consisting of people who resisted gang recruitment efforts. He contended that two neighborhood gangs tried to recruit him and threatened to kill him if he refused to join. When the gangs continued to harass him \u2014 despite his reports to the police\u2014 Castillo-Guerrero fled to Costa Rica, where he stayed for almost five years before entering the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-7\">The BIA denied relief, concluding that Castillo-Guerrero failed to demonstrate that he was a member of a \u201cparticular social group\u201d within the meaning of the Immigration and Nationality Act (\u201cINA\u201d) because mistreatment on account of resistance to gang recruitment does not constitute persecution on account of a protected ground. The BIA also determined that the group that Castillo-Guerrero described was \u201ctoo amorphous\u201d to be recognized as a particular social group.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-8\">For purposes of the INA, members of a \u201cparticular social group\u201d are people with a \u201cshared characteristic ... such as sex, col- or, or kinship ties, or in some circumstances ... a shared past experience such as former military leadership or land ownership.\u201d <em>Castillo-Arias v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>446 F.3d 1190, 1193 (11th Cir.2006). In determining whether a social group qualifies for protection under the INA, courts must consider whether the shared characteristic is immutable and whether it is socially visible. <em>Id. </em>at 1194. In other words, the shared characteristic \u201cmust be one that the members of the group either cannot change, or should not be required to change because it is fundamental to their individual identities or consciences\u201d and one that is \u201chighly visible and recognizable by others in the country in question.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1193-94.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-9\">Castillo-Guerrero has not identified himself as a member of a social group that meets these requirements. Although he may be at risk of persecution, that risk alone does not create a \u201cparticular social group\u201d. <em>See id. </em>at 1198. And nothing evidences that the gangs \u201cwould treat [Castillo-Guerrero] any differently from any other person the [gangs] perceived to have interfered with its activities.\u201d <em>See id.-, see also Matter of S-E-G-, </em>24 I. &amp; N. Dec. 579 (BIA 2008) (concluding that a social group consisting of people who had resisted recruitment efforts by a criminal gang \u201cbased on their own personal, moral, and religious opposition to the gang\u2019s values and activities\u201d did not constitute a \u201cparticular social group\u201d under the INA). Thus, Castillo-Guerrero has failed to demonstrate either that his proposed social group shares an immutable characteristic or is sufficiently visible.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-10\">Substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s decision that Castillo-Guerrero was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"752\">*752</page-number>unentitled to asylum; and we are not compelled to reverse the decision. Castillo-Guerrero\u2019s failure to establish eligibility for asylum forecloses his eligibility for withholding of removal. <em>See Forgue, </em>401 F.3d at 1288 n. 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-4\">PETITION DISMISSED IN PART, DENIED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b778-14\"> The IJ also denied relief under the Convention Against Torture. We will not address this claim, however, because Castillo-Guerrero failed to challenge this denial in his appeal to the BIA \u2014 and, thus, failed to exhaust his administrative remedies \u2014 and fails to raise the issue on appeal. <em>See Amaya-Artunduaga v. U.S. Att'y Gen., </em>463 F.3d 1247, 1250-51 (11th Cir.2006); <em>Sepulveda v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1226, 1228 n. 2 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
