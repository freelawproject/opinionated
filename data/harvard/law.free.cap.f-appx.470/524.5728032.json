His counsel has moved to withdraw, and has filed a brief citing <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b552-23\">To the extent the <em>Anders </em>brief may be read as challenging the reasonableness of Ramos\u2019s sentence, we conclude the argument fails. <em>See United States v. Feemster, </em>572 F.3d 455, 461-62 (8th Cir.2009) (en banc) (describing method for undertaking appellate review of sentences); <em>United States v. Moore, </em>581 F.3d 681, 684 (8th Cir.2009) (per curiam) (where district court has sentenced defendant below advisory Guidelines range, it is nearly inconceivable that court abused its discretion in not varying downward further). Having independently reviewed the record under <em>Penson v. Ohio, </em>488 U.S. 75, 80, 109 S.Ct. 346, 102 L.Ed.2d 300 (1988), we have found no nonfrivolous issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-24\">Accordingly, we affirm. We also grant counsel leave to withdraw, subject to counsel informing Ramos about the procedures for seeking rehearing and petitioning for a writ of certiorari.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b552-21\">. The Honorable John A. Jarvey, United States District Judge for the Southern District of Iowa.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
