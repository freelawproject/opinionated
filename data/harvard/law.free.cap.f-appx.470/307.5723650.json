Crosby sued his former employer, Computer Sciences Corporation (\u201cCSC\u201d), for race, sex, and age discrimination under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e <em>et seq., </em>and the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 (\u201cADEA\u201d), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 621 <em>et seq. </em>The district court granted summary judgment in favor of CSC. We now AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-8\">CSC is a consulting firm that offers technological business solutions and services. CSC hired Crosby in 2008 as a manager in its Supply Services department. Crosby is an African-American male who was born in 1953. Crosby\u2019s supervisor, Roger Condit, is a Caucasian male who was born in 1947. Crosby oversaw approximately 50 employees, including Carmen Casey, a computer operator in Crosby\u2019s department.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-9\">In November 2009, Casey complained about Crosby to CSC Human Resources personnel. She reported that Crosby harassed her by making inappropriate sexual comments to her and then retaliated against her after she rebuffed his advances. Specifically, she complained that Crosby retaliated against her by singling her out for criticism at staff meetings and on other occasions. CSC did not immediately take action, but after Casey filed a subsequent written complaint in December, CSC suspended Crosby and conducted an investigation. Thereafter, in January 2010, CSC terminated Crosby.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-12\">Crosby sued. Against CSC he alleged race, sex, and age discrimination in violation of Title VII and the ADEA. He also brought a state law claim against Condit and Casey for tortious interference with business relations. CSC, Condit, and Casey moved for summary judgment and the district court granted their motions. Crosby timely appealed.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b336-13\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-14\">We review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment. <em>Hoog-Watson v. Guadalupe Cnty., Tex., </em>591 F.3d 431, 434 (5th Cir.2009). Summary judgment is proper if \u201cthere is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b336-15\">The elements of a prima facie case of discrimination are identical under Title VII and the ADEA. <em>Thornbrough v. Columbus &amp; Greenville R.R. Co., </em>760 F.2d 633, 638-39 n. 4 (5th Cir.1985), <em>abrogated on other grounds by St. Mary\u2019s Honor Ctr. v. Hicks, </em>509 U.S. 502, 113 S.Ct. 2742, 125 L.Ed.2d 407 (1993). A disparate treatment plaintiff like Crosby must show that he: \u201c(1) is a member of a protected class; (2) was qualified for [his] position; (3) was subject to an adverse employment action; and (4) ... that others similarly situated were treated more favorably.\u201d <em>Okoye v. Univ. of Tex. Hous. Health Sci. Ctr., </em>245 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>F.3d 507, 512-13 (5th Cir.2001) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b337-5\">Only the fourth element is at issue. Crosby has proffered Condit as his only comparator. As the district court correctly explained, an employee must proffer a . comparator who was treated more favorably \u201cunder nearly identical circumstances.\u201d <em>Lee v. Kansas City S. Ry. Co., </em>574 F.3d 253, 260 (5th Cir.2009). This standard is satisfied \u201cwhen the employees being compared held the same job or responsibilities, shared the same supervisor or had their employment status determined by the same person, and have essentially comparable violation histories.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citations omitted). \u201c[Cjritically, the plaintiffs conduct that drew the adverse employment decision must have been \u2018nearly identical\u2019 to that of the proffered comparator who allegedly drew dissimilar employment decisions.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b337-6\">Here, the district court correctly determined that Condit is not a valid comparator because he was Crosby\u2019s supervisor (and therefore did not have the same supervisor as Crosby) and does not have a violation history comparable to Crosby\u2019s. Crosby argues that Condit also created a hostile work environment by failing to investigate Casey\u2019s initial harassment complaints against Crosby, for which Crosby was suspended and then terminated (after an HR investigation). Even assuming <em>arguendo </em>that Condit violated company policy by not immediately launching an investigation into complaints against Crosby\u2014 as Crosby claims \u2014 this violation would not be \u201cnearly identical\u201d to Crosby\u2019s because it would violate a different aspect of CSC\u2019s personnel policy. <em>See Smith v. Wal-Mart Stores, </em>891 F.2d 1177, 1180 (5th Cir.1990) (per curiam). Moreover, it is facially absurd for a plaintiff to argue that his proffered comparator engaged in comparable misconduct by not investigating swiftly enough the workplace complaints <em>against the plaintiff </em>for which the plaintiff was ultimately fired.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-8\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-9\">Crosby has not identified a proper comparator and thus has not satisfied the fourth element of a prima facie disparate treatment case. The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b336-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court lias determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b336-16\">. Crosby's appellate brief does not address his tortious interference claim. It is therefore deemed waived. <em>See United States v. Scroggins, </em>599 F.3d 433, 446-47 (5th Cir.2010).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
