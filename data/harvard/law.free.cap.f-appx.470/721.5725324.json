For the reasons set forth below, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-9\">I. Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b750-10\">On July 31, 2002, an armed man wearing a ski mask and sunglasses robbed Stella Von Klan at her home, causing substantial injuries to her head and hand. The robber stole Von Klan\u2019s jewelry and car. During the robbery, Von Klan managed to take off the robber\u2019s sunglasses, which the police later found at the scene of the crime. Hernandez was subsequently arrested and charged as the perpetrator.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-11\">At Hernandez\u2019s trial, the state called several witnesses, including Adriana Kristaly, a forensic biologist and an expert in DNA analysis. Kristaly testified that she obtained a DNA sample from the sunglasses and found a mixture of DNA profiles in the sample. The DNA profiles of Von Klan, her husband, and Hernandez could not be excluded from the DNA mixture. However, Kristaly could not say that the DNA sample matched any of the three individuals.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-14\">The state also introduced the testimonies of two police officers, Anthony Feria and Luis Iglesis. Feria testified that on August 15, 2002, after Hernandez\u2019s arrest, Feria interviewed him at the police station along with Iglesis. At this interview, after being read his Miranda<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> rights, Hernandez refused to sign the <em>Miranda </em>waiver form. However, he verbally waived his rights and admitted his guilt, explaining in detail how he robbed Von Klan. After Hernandez confessed, Feria and Iglesis went with him to search for the stolen jewelry and car, but did not find anything. When they returned to the police station, Feria met the lead detective in the case, Kimberly Llambes, and told her about Hernandez\u2019s confession. Llambes, Feria, and Hernandez then went back into the interview room, where Hernandez signed a <em>Miranda </em>waiver form and provided a brief synopsis of his earlier confession. Feria testified that he could not recall whether Iglesis was present during the latest confession, but believed Iglesis was not there. Iglesis essentially corroborated Feria\u2019s testimony and stated that, after the search for the stolen property, Iglesis had no more involvement in the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-15\">Twice during the trial, the court asked Hernandez and his counsel whether they wanted jury instructions on any lesser-included offenses. Both Hernandez and his counsel assured the court that they did not. In instructing the jury, the court described the offenses charged in each count of the state\u2019s information (battery, burglary, carjacking, robbery, and kidnaping, respectively), the elements of those offenses, and the meaning of various aggravating factors. Specifically, with re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"723\">*723</page-number>gard to Count 3, the court told the jury: \u201cBefore you can find the defendant guilty of Carjacking as charged in Count Three of the Information, the State must prove the following three elements beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d The court explained all the elements of carjacking and the various terms contained in the definition of the offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-5\">The court further instructed the jurors that it was their responsibility to decide what evidence was reliable and not reliable. The court described several factors that the jury should look for in assessing the credibility of witnesses and stated: \u201cYou may rely upon your own conclusion about the witness. A juror may believe or disbelieve all or any part of the evidence or the testimony of any witness.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b751-6\">When instructing the jury on the state\u2019s burden of proof, the court explained that the defendant is presumed innocent unless that presumption \u201chas been overcome by the evidence to the exclusion of and beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d The court further explained that \u201cmere possible doubt, a speculative, imaginary or forced doubt\u201d must not influence the jurors to return a not-guilty verdict if they have \u201can abiding conviction of guilt.\u201d The court then stated, according to the trial transcript:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b751-7\">On the other hand, if, after carefully considering, comparing and weighing all the evidence, there is not an abiding conviction of guilt, or, if, having a conviction, it is one which is not stable but one which waivers and vacillates, then the charge is proved beyond every reasonable doubt and you must find the defendant not guilty because the doubt is reasonable.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b751-8\">In the written jury instructions, however, the last clause of the second paragraph above provided: \u201cthen the charge is not proved beyond every reasonable doubt.\u201d Subsequently, the state obtained an affidavit from the court reporter, who affirmed that she erroneously transcribed the jury instruction at issue, and that the correct reading should be, \u201cThen the charge is <em>not </em>proved.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b751-10\">The court gave the jury a printed copy of the instructions and the charging information to take to the jury room. The court also provided the jury with a verdict form, which asked the jury to check a box labeled guilty or not guilty on each count. With regard to Count 3, the verdict form designated the charged offense as \u201cRobbery/Carjacking.\u201d In explaining the verdict form to the jury, the court stated: \u201cThe verdict form for Count Three is Carjacking.\u201d The jury ultimately found Hernandez guilty on all counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-11\">After Hernandez\u2019s direct criminal proceedings and his state post-conviction proceedings ended, he filed the instant \u00a7 2254 habeas petition in the district court, alleging multiple claims of ineffective assistance of counsel. In relevant part, Hernandez alleged that his counsel rendered ineffective assistance by (1) failing to request Florida\u2019s Standard Instruction 3.9(a) on the testimony of expert witnesses, as a result of which the jury may have given undue weight to the DNA expert\u2019s opinion testimony; (2) failing to object to the apparently erroneous instruction on reasonable doubt; (3) failing to impeach or otherwise challenge the testimonies of officers Feria and Iglesis because they testified inconsistently on whether Iglesis was present during Hernandez\u2019s confession; and (4) failing to object to the ambiguous verdict form concerning Count 3 of the charging information. The district court denied Hernandez\u2019s \u00a7 2254 petition but granted a certificate of appealability on the above four claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-12\">II. Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b751-13\">We review the district court\u2019s denial of a \u00a7 2254 petition <em>de novo, </em>but accord defer<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"724\">*724</page-number>ence to the state court\u2019s decision on the merits of a claim. <em>Davis v. Jones, </em>506 F.3d 1325, 1331 (11th Cir.2007). Federal courts may not grant habeas relief on claims previously adjudicated on the merits in a state court unless the state court\u2019s decision was \u201ccontrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States,\u201d or \u201cresulted in a decision that was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the State court proceeding.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d); <em>Davis, </em>506 F.3d at 1331.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b752-4\">To prevail on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, a defendant must establish two elements, namely, (1) that counsel\u2019s performance was deficient, and (2) that the deficient performance prejudiced the defense. <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 2064, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). The standard for measuring attorney performance is whether counsel acted reasonably under the \u201cprevailing professional norms,\u201d and a court \u201cmust indulge a strong presumption that counsel\u2019s conduct falls within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 688-89, 104 S.Ct. at 2065. To establish prejudice, a defendant must show a \u201creasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 694, 104 S.Ct. at 2068.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-5\">Hernandez failed to meet the elements of <em>Strickland </em>on all four of his ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claims. First, Hernandez failed to show any prejudice resulting from his counsel\u2019s failure to request a jury instruction on expert testimony. Florida\u2019s standard instruction on expert witnesses provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b752-8\">Expert witnesses are like other witnesses, with one exception \u2014 the law permits an expert witness to give [his] [her] opinion.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b752-9\">However, an expert\u2019s opinion is reliable only when given on a subject about which you believe [him] [her] to be an expert.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b752-10\">Like other witnesses, you may believe or disbelieve all or any part of an expert\u2019s testimony.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b752-11\">Florida Standard Jury Instruction 3.9(a) (adopted in 1981). Hernandez argues that, absent this instruction, the jury may have given undue weight to Kristaly\u2019s testimony regarding the DNA found on the perpetrator\u2019s sunglasses. However, the trial court instructed the jurors that it was up to them to decide what evidence was reliable or unreliable. The court also described several factors to be considered in evaluating the testimony of witnesses and told the jurors that they \u201cmay believe or disbelieve, all or any part of the evidence or the testimony of any witness.\u201d In light of these instructions, it is highly unlikely that the jury believed that it had to accept Kristaly\u2019s testimony as true. <em>See Weeks v. Angelone, </em>528 U.S. 225, 234, 120 S.Ct. 727, 733, 145 L.Ed.2d 727 (2000) (\u201cA jury is presumed to follow its instructions.\u201d). Ac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"725\">*725</page-number>cordingly, Hernandez failed to show a reasonable probability that, but for his counsel\u2019s failure to request instruction 3.9(a), the outcome of the trial would have been different. <em>See Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 694, 104 S.Ct. at 2068.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-5\">Second, Hernandez failed to show \u25a0that his counsel acted deficiently by not objecting to the apparently erroneous instruction on reasonable doubt. The affidavit of the court reporter, coupled with the written instructions, indicates that the court correctly instructed the jury on the state\u2019s burden of proof and that the error reflected in the trial transcript \u2014 omission of the word \u201cnot\u201d \u2014 occurred only in transcription. In any event, in light of the court\u2019s other instructions on reasonable doubt, no reasonable jury could have construed the court\u2019s erroneous statement literally, especially after looking at the correct phrasing in the written instructions. Thus, even if counsel was deficient for not objecting to the error, Hernandez failed to establish any prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-6\">Third, Hernandez\u2019s counsel did not perform deficiently by failing to challenge or impeach the testimonies of officers Feria and Iglesis. A review of the transcript does not reveal any inconsistencies in their statements about whether Iglesis was present during Hernandez\u2019s confession. Both Feria and Iglesis testified that Iglesis was present during the initial confession, at which Hernandez refused to sign the <em>Miranda </em>waiver form. Both Feria and Iglesis also indicated that Iglesis was not present during the second confession, which occurred after the search for the victim\u2019s jewelry and car, and during which Hernandez actually signed the <em>Miranda </em>waiver form. Thus, Hernandez\u2019s counsel had no reason to challenge the officers\u2019 testimonies.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-7\">Finally, Hernandez failed to show any prejudice stemming from his counsel\u2019s failure to challenge the verdict form on Count 3. Hernandez argues that he suffered prejudice because the ambiguity in the verdict form precluded him from being convicted on carjacking\u2019s lesser-included offense, that is, robbery. <em>See Baynham v. State, </em>862 So.2d 808, 808-10 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App.2003) (holding that robbery is a lesser-included offense of carjacking). However, Hernandez himself expressly declined to instruct the jury on any lesser-included offenses. Thus, he cannot now complain that he was denied the opportunity to be convicted of robbery rather than carjacking on Count 3 of the information. <em>See Leverett v. Spears, </em>877 F.2d 921, 924 (11th Cir.1989) (holding that the doctrine of invited error precluded a habeas petitioner from challenging a jury instruction on a lesser-included offense, as the petitioner had requested the instruction in the trial court).</p>\n<p id=\"b753-9\">To the extent Hernandez argues that the inclusion of robbery on the verdict form prevented him from being acquitted on Count 3 (which charged carjacking), he again failed to show prejudice. The district court instructed the jury on the elements of carjacking with respect to Count 3, told the jury that the \u201cverdict form for Count Three is Carjacking,\u201d and provided the jury with the written instructions and the charging information. Thus, the jurors understood that they would have to acquit Hernandez on Count 3 if the evidence was insufficient to prove all the elements of carjacking beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>See Weeks, </em>528 U.S. at 234, 120 S.Ct. at 733. Accordingly, Hernandez failed to show a reasonable likelihood of a different outcome but for counsel\u2019s failure to object to the verdict form. <em>See Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 694, 104 S.Ct. at 2068.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-10\">Because Hernandez failed to establish all the elements of <em>Strickland </em>with respect <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"726\">*726</page-number>to any of his claims, the state court did not unreasonably apply federal law and did not unreasonably determine the facts in denying his claims of ineffective assistance of counsel. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d); <em>Davis, </em>506 F.3d at 1331. Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s denial of his \u00a7 2254 petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b750-12\">. <em>Miranda v.

We note that Hernandez's first claim, regarding the instructions on expert witness testimony, may not have been addressed on the merits in the state courts. <em>See Bellizia v.

However, we need not decide whether \u00a7 2254(d) deference is due on this issue, as we can readily deny Hernandez claim after reviewing it <em>de novo. See Berghuis v. Thompkins, </em>560 U.S. -, -, 130 S.Ct. 2250, 2265, 176 L.Ed.2d 1098 (2010) (stating that a court may deny a habeas petition on <em>de novo </em>review when it is not clear whether deference applies, as the petitioner will not be entitled to habeas relief if his claim is rejected on <em>de novo </em>review).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
