May 5, 2011). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-18\">The sole issue presented by this petition is whether the BIA failed to properly analyze Cortez\u2019s claim that <em>Perdomo v. Holder, </em>611 F.3d 662 (9th Cir.2010), constitutes a change in law justifying reconsideration of the BIA\u2019s January 26, 2011 decision. In order to demonstrate entitlement to reconsideration based on a change in law, the movant \u201cmust show how [the] change in law materially affects [the] prior decision.\u201d <em>Matter of O-S-G, </em>24 I. &amp; N. Dec. 56, 58 (B.I.A.2006). Because the BIA correctly determined that the Ninth Circuit\u2019s decision in <em>Perdomo </em>is not binding on the Second Circuit, <em>see Matter of Anselmo, </em>20 I. &amp; N. Dec. 25, 31 (B.I.A.1989), and, thus, did not materially affect its January 26, 2011 decision, the BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying reconsideration. <em>See Ke Zhen Zhao v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>265 F.3d 83, 93 (2d Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b85-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. As we have completed our review, any stay of removal that the Court previously granted in this petition is VACATED, and any pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DENIED as moot. Any pending request for oral argument in this petition is DENIED in accordance with Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 34(a)(2), and Second Circuit Local Rule 34.1(b).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
