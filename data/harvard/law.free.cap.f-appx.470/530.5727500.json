Bryan MEPPELINK, Appellant.</parties>\n<docketnumber data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"docketnumber\" id=\"b558-17\">No. 11-3836.</docketnumber>\n<court data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"court\" id=\"b558-18\">United States Court of Appeals, Eighth Circuit.</court>\n<otherdate data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"b558-19\">Submitted: April 16, 2012.</otherdate>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"b558-20\">Filed: April 20, 2012.</decisiondate>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b558-22\">Before BYE, BEAM, and BENTON, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b558-24\">PER CURIAM.</author>\n<p id=\"b558-25\">Bryan Jonathon Meppelink pled guilty to one count of possession of a firearm by a prohibited person, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 922(g)(4) (previous mental-institution patients) and 922(g)(9) (misdemean- or domestic-violence offenders). The district court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> sentenced him to 57 months\u2019 imprisonment, followed by three years of supervised release. On appeal, Meppelink challenges the substantive reasonableness of his sentence, arguing that the district court failed to properly consider the mitigating circumstances of his case.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-26\">We consider \u201cthe substantive reasonableness of the sentence imposed under an abuse of discretion standard.\u201d <em>United States v. Feemster, </em>572 F.3d 455, 461 (8th Cir.2009) (en banc) (quoting <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007)).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b559-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>An abuse of discretion occurs when: (1) a court fails to consider a relevant factor that should have received significant weight; (2) a court gives significant weight to an improper or irrelevant factor; or (3) a court considers only the appropriate factors but in weighting them commits a clear error of judgment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A7R\"><em>United States v. Williams, </em>624 F.3d 889, 896-97 (8th Cir.2010), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 132 S.Ct. 370, 181 L.Ed.2d 236 (2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b559-7\">The sentence in this case was within the (uncontested) Guideline range of 46 to 57 months. \u201cA sentence within the Guideline range is accorded a presumption of substantive reasonableness on appeal.\u201d <em>United States v. Robinson, </em>516 F.3d 716, 717 (8th Cir.2008). <em>See Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 347, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b559-8\">Meppelink argues that the district court failed to consider his mental-health issues, and his lack of knowledge of the firearm prohibition. When a district court is made aware of a defendant\u2019s proposed mitigation factors, we presume that each of them was considered and rejected. <em>United States v. Wisecarver, </em>644 F.3d 764, 774 (8th Cir.2011). The record demonstrates that the district court was not only aware of the applicable statutory factors under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), but also carefully considered them, specifically discussing Meppelink\u2019s mental-health issues. Accordingly, the district court did not abuse its discretion in sentencing Meppelink; his sentence, at the top of the advisory Guidelines range, was not unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-9\">The judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b558-27\">.
