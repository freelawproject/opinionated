We have reviewed the administrative record and conclude that the Board did not abuse its discretion in denying Bailey\u2019s motions. <em>See 8 </em>C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(a) (2011). We accordingly deny the petition for review for the reasons stated by the Board. <em>See In re: Bailey </em>(B.I.A. Aug. 9, 2011). We grant the Attorney General\u2019s motion to strike pages 169-230 of the joint appendix, and dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-20\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
