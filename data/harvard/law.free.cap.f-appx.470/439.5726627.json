King appeals from the district court order granting the summary-judgment motion brought by Defendant-Appellee Pennsylvania Life Insurance Co. (\u201cPenn Life\u201d) and dismissing King\u2019s complaint. King alleges that Penn Life (as successor-in-interest to Massachusetts Indemnity and Life Insurance Company, or \u201cMass Life\u201d) improperly terminated payments owed to him under a disability insurance policy because his stroke-induced disability was caused by \u201caccidental bodily injury\u201d and not \u201csickness.\u201d Penn Life maintains that King\u2019s benefits terminated when he turned 65 because his disability was caused by sickness. Because we find that there are genuine issues of material fact in dispute, we REVERSE the district court\u2019s judgment and REMAND the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-21\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-22\">This case is an insurance-coverage dispute. At the time of the events that undergird this lawsuit, Dr. King was a practicing osteopathic surgeon residing in the Flint, Michigan area. On November 23, 1976, when King was 35 years old, Mass Life issued to King a disability-income insurance policy that would provide him with coverage \u201cin the event of disability which <em>results from accidental bodily injury </em>sustained while this policy is in force or in the event of disability which <em>results from sickness </em>which first manifests itself while this policy is in force.\u201d (emphases added). King had to describe his medical history on the insurance application, and on the family history portion, King listed that his father died of a stroke at age 48. Under the policy, the term \u201ctotal disability\u201d means \u201ccomplete inability to engage in the Insured\u2019s regular occupation.\u201d The policy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>does not define the terms \u201caccidental bodily injury\u201d or \u201csickness.\u201d Under the policy, in the event King became disabled he would receive monthly benefits for a certain period of time, the length of which depended on the cause of his disability. If his disability was the result of \u201caccidental bodily injury,\u201d he would receive benefits for the rest of his life; if his disability resulted from \u201csickness,\u201d however, he would only receive benefits until he turned 65 years old. The actual cause of King\u2019s disability is at the heart of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-4\">On December 8, 1977, King \u201cfell in the snow\u201d while he was skiing in Alta, Utah with his friend and fellow physician, Dr. John L. Schriner. Dr. Schriner examined King on the ski slope after he fell and noted that King \u201cdid not seem to be injured.\u201d King reportedly \u201cnoted some numbness in [his] right upper extremities\u201d that lasted for 15-20 minutes after he fell. The next day, on December 9, 1977, King suffered a stroke (in medical parlance, a cerebral vascular accident) while riding up the chair lift. He was brought to a local hospital and was examined by Dr. Wayne M. Hebertson, who noted that King had developed a \u201cmarked paralysis involving the right face, arm, and leg.\u201d Dr. Hebert-son\u2019s report states that a \u201cCT scan was done revealing a small lesion in the region of the left insula.\u201d The report concluded that King had suffered \u201cAcute intracerebral bleeding on the left, cause undetermined.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b468-5\">After several days in the hospital, King returned home to Michigan and was examined by Dr. Gary W. Roat on December 22, 1977, who determined that King had suffered an \u201cintracerebral hemorrhage\u201d and was totally disabled as a result. There is some dispute surrounding the physician\u2019s report from this examination. The form for the report included spaces marked \u201cDue to sickness?\u201d and \u201cDue to accident?\u201d that could be filled out. Dr. Roat wrote \u201csee above\u201d [referring to his diagnosis description] in the spaced marked \u201cDue to sickness?\u201d The space marked \u201cDue to accident?\u201d has a line drawn through it. It is not clear who drew a line through the \u201caccident\u201d section. King maintains that a representative from Mass life drew the line before giving it to Dr. Roat, while Penn Life assumes that Dr. Roat drew the line himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-7\">This physician\u2019s report was attached to King\u2019s \u201cStatement of Claim\u201d form, which he filled out and submitted to Mass Life on January 6, 1978 so that he could collect disability benefits. That form contains two sections particularly relevant here: one to be completed <em>\u201cIF DISABILITY DUE TO SICKNESS </em>\u201d and another to be completed <em>\u201cIF DISABILITY DUE TO ACCIDENTA </em>(emphases in original). The former section on the form (the sickness section) is filled out, with \u201cSickness\u201d typed in as the \u201cNature of illness\u201d and \u201c12/9/77\u201d listed as the \u201cDate of first symptoms.\u201d The latter section (the accident section) is crossed out by hand and is blank. King maintains that a representative of Mass Life crossed out the \u201caccident\u201d section before King received the form and filled it out.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-8\">After receiving King\u2019s Statement of Claim, Mass Life began paying a monthly disability benefit of $2,500 because King was totally disabled. (Eventually, King was able to resume the practice of medicine as a radiologist, but he was never able to <em>perform </em>surgery because of his limited use of his right hand.) In July 1978 King wrote to Mass Life to provide an update on his disability and the prospects of resuming his \u201cregular occupation\u201d as a surgeon. In that letter, King stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b468-9\">As you know, I am receiving disability benefits from your company since suffering a stroke in December of 1977. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>Previous to my illness, I was a practicing general surgeon, performing major surgical procedures five to seven days . per week. For six months following my illness, I was unable to do any type of work....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b469-5\">After it started paying benefits, Mass Life conducted further investigation into King\u2019s disability. Mass Life agent Jack Rayner visited King on November 2, 1978, and sent a report to Mass Life representative Mick Orend on November 10 noting that King had fallen in the snow the day before his stroke was diagnosed, that King had \u201cfelt some discomfort in his arm and shoulder\u201d after he fell, and that Dr. Schriner \u201cwas the only physician involved prior to the hospital [in Utah].\u201d Rayner also noted that an angiogram (presumably conducted at the hospital in Utah) \u201cshowed an A.V. [arteriovenous] malformation.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Following up on Rayner\u2019s report, Mass Life asked Dr. Schriner for a narrative description of his observations while skiing with King on December 8 and 9, 1977, and Dr. Schriner responded with a letter dated March 12, 1979. That letter referred to King\u2019s \u201cinjuries\u201d suffered in connection with an \u201caccident,\u201d stating, \u201cPrior to his injury he was assumed to be in excellent health and he and I had been skiing for at least one to two days prior to the accident.\u201d In a subsequent memorandum to the file dated April 16, 1979, Orend wrote the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b469-6\">. Larry Cattani [another Mass Life official] &amp; I discussed this file. We agreed that even if there were a question of accident vs. sickness \u2014 which there doesn\u2019t appear to be \u2014 that question is not particularly pressing, since benefits are payable for sickness to age 65 for qualifying claims (2006 in this case).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b469-10\">Larry suggested [another doctor] review the case re: when and if we need an IME.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-11\">Around the same time, Mass Life agents met with King to get his authorization to access the ski-patrol reports for its investigation. The notes from that interview state that King disagreed with the wording in the authorization form that referred to his stroke as a \u201cskiing accident,\u201d saying that \u201cthere wasn\u2019t actually an accident involved.\u201d Accordingly, Mass Life \u201cchanged the word accident to incident.\u201d King \u201creviewed the authorization as [Mass Life] had corrected it, signed and dated the authorization.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b469-12\">Mass Life\u2019s investigation continued. A Mass Life \u201cClaim Department Medical Referral Form\u201d dated April 17, 1979 noted that Dr. Sehriner\u2019s use of the word \u201cinjury\u201d could be \u201cvery significant\u201d and that its use in the letter was a \u201clittle bit out of context,\u201d and recommended clarifying \u201cthe meaning of injury as used by Dr. Schriner.\u201d Accordingly, on June 25, 1979, Dr. Rodney Larcom from Mass Life wrote to Dr. Schriner asking him to clarify the \u201cdouble reference to injury\u201d in his narrative description. The letter continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b469-13\">In our file we have information from the Ski Patrol, complete hospital records, and our field representative\u2019s personal report and repeated reports from his attending physician. In none of these is there mentioned any specific positive relationship to trauma as a basis for his condition. There is a mention of cerebral insult and I wonder if this is the context of your reference to injury; i.e. cellular injury.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b470-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>Dr. Schriner responded in a letter dated July 16, 1979: \u201cI consider his vascular accident was an injury to his brain, and I am not in any way reflecting that this was a result of trauma. In reality, there was no trauma involved in his vascular accident.\u201d King continued receiving monthly benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-4\">On or around August 21, 1987, King requested that Mass Life send him a letter describing his disability benefits that he could give to a loan officer. Mass Life agreed and sent him a letter dated the same day that stated: \u201cPlease let this letter serve to confirm that the monthly disability benefit of your policy is $2,500.00, and that those benefits will continue until your 65th birthday.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b470-5\">Penn Life (which acquired Mass Life at some later point), continued to pay King\u2019s benefits until May 2006, at which point it sent King a letter notifying him that his \u201cmonthly benefits should have ceased on 3/27/06,\u201d King\u2019s 65th birthday. The letter stated: \u2018Tour policy provides benefits when Sickness results in Total Disability. The monthly income under this provision of your policy is payable until your 65th birthday.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b470-6\">In June 2006 King\u2019s attorney sent a letter to Penn Life disputing the stoppage of benefits. The letter stated that King had \u201csuffered an accident while skiing (hit a tree) in December of 1977. The following day, as a result of this accident, he developed a brain hemorrhage resulting in a stroke.\u201d The letter stated further that \u201cCharles King\u2019s hemorrhage resulted from the accident, and as a result, the policy benefits allow him lifetime disability.\u201d Penn Life responded by letter that it \u201crespectfully decline[d] to consider a revised version of the underlying facts of this case at this late date.\u201d The parties exchanged similar letters in August 2008.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-7\">King filed this lawsuit in 2009, and Penn Life filed for summary judgment shortly after answering the complaint. Penn Life argued that there was no dispute that King\u2019s disability was caused by sickness (i.e., the stroke that occurred on December 9, 1977), and that it was entitled to summary judgment because it was clear under the policy that the benefits King had received for his sickness-related disability should have terminated when King turned 65. Opposing the motion, King argued that there was a genuine issue of material fact regarding whether his disability resulted from \u201caccidental bodily injury\u201d or \u201csickness,\u201d rendering summary judgment inappropriate. In support, King offered the affidavit of Dr. Christopher Sweet, a neuro-radiologist who offered his opinion regarding the cause of King\u2019s disability. In his affidavit, Dr. Sweet stated that he had \u201creviewed the Complaint ... along with CT scans and St. Marks medical records pertaining to Dr. King\u2019s 1977 skiing accident ... including the December 9, 1977, CT scans.\u201d The substance of the affidavit stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-8\">[Bjased upon the information provided to me, as above-described, as well as upon my years of education, training, and experience, it is my professional medical opinion that the cerebral vascular accident suffered by Dr. King in December 1977, first manifested itself on December 8, 1977, after he fell in the snow and immediately experienced numbness in his right upper extremity, lasting for approximately 15-20 minutes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-9\">[I]t is my further opinion that Dr. King\u2019s brain injury, which I believe consisted of a deep bleed in the small vessels, later became fully manifest when, on December 9, 1977, Dr. King began to exhibit right facial paralysis, right upper extremity paralysis, weakness and numbness, and related symptomatology.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>[I]t is my further opinion that, since Dr. King did not, prior to December 8, 1977, have any underlying symptoms or signs of an impending stroke, (e.g., blood disorders such as \u201cFactor V,\u201d any blood thinning disorder, diabetes, renal insufficiency, congestive heart failure, hypertension, or headaches), Dr. King\u2019s brain injury was an unanticipated, sudden, spontaneous vascular accident that, based upon reasonable medical probabil-. ity, occurred due to a combination of (a). Dr. King\u2019s December 8, 1977, neurological-symptoms producing fall in the snow, (b). The very high altitude at which said fall in the snow occurred, and (c). a deep bleed in the small vessels on the left side of Dr. King\u2019s brain.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b471-5\">The magistrate judge recommended that the motion for summary judgment be granted, finding that King had not offered enough evidence for a reasonable jury to find for him. The district judge adopted that recommendation, granting the summary-judgment motion and dismissing the complaint. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-7\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-8\">We review a district court\u2019s grant of a motion for summary judgment de novo, construing the evidence and drawing all reasonable inferences in favor of the non-moving party \u2014 in this case, King. <em>Ireland v. Tunis, </em>113 F.3d 1435, 1440 (6th Cir.1997). Summary judgment is proper if, after viewing the evidence that way, there are no genuine issues of material fact, entitling the moving party to judgment as a matter of law. <em>Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., </em>475 U.S. 574, 587, 106 S.Ct. 1348, 89 L.Ed.2d 538 (1986); Fed.R.Civ.P. 56. The moving party has \u201cthe burden of showing the absence of a genuine issue as to any material fact.\u201d <em>Adickes v. S.H. Kress &amp; Co., </em>398 U.S. 144, 157, 90 S.Ct. 1598, 26 L.Ed.2d 142 (1970). For its part, the non-movant must \u201cdo more than simply show that there is some metaphysical doubt as to the material facts.\u201d <em>Matsushita, </em>475 U.S. at 586, 106 S.Ct. 1348. It must provide \u201csignificant probative evidence\u201d to defeat a properly supported summary-judgment motion. <em>Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., </em>477 U.S. 242, 248, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986). In other words, we must decide whether there is enough evidence for a jury to decide for the non-movant before denying a summary-judgment motion. <em>See id. </em>at 252, 106 S.Ct. 2505.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-10\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-11\">The cause of King\u2019s stroke and ensuing disability is the heart of this case because there is no dispute that King became disabled after he suffered a stroke. The main issue is whether, for purposes of the policy, the disability-inducing stroke was caused by \u201csickness\u201d or by \u201caccidental bodily injury.\u201d As an initial matter, then, we must determine what the term \u201caccidental bodily injury\u201d means in the context of King\u2019s disability insurance policy. The policy itself does not define the term, and so we must look elsewhere. When interpreting a contract in a diversity case, we apply the law of the forum state \u2014 in this case, Michigan, <em>Uhl v. Komatsu Forklift Co., Ltd., </em>512 F.3d 294, 302 (6th Cir.2008), and the Michigan Supreme Court is authoritative on questions of Michigan law, <em>Prestige Cas. Co. v. Michigan Mut. Ins. Co., </em>99 F.3d 1340, 1348 (6th Cir.1996). When interpreting an insurance policy under Michigan law, then, we employ traditional principles of contract interpretation, <em>Frankenmuth Mut. Ins. Co. v. Masters, </em>460 Mich. 105, 595 N.W.2d 832, 837 (1999), keeping in mind that the \u201cinsurance contract must be enforced in accordance with its terms,\u201d <em>Henderson v. State Farm, </em>460 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>Mich. 348, 596 N.W.2d 190, 193 (1999). A provision is ambiguous if it is \u201csusceptible to two different reasonable interpretations.\u201d <em>Comerica Bank v. Lexington Ins. Co., </em>3 F.3d 939, 942 (6th Cir.1993). In the event of an ambiguity, courts must construe the contract \u201cin favor of the insured,\u201d <em>Henderson, </em>596 N.W.2d at 194, but courts \u201cshould not create ambiguity in an insurance policy where the terms of the contract are clear and precise,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 193. And \u201cthe fact that a policy does not define a relevant term does not render the policy ambiguous.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 194.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b472-4\">If the insurance policy fails to define a term, the court must interpret it according to its commonly used meaning, taking into account the reasonable expectations of the parties. That is, the policy language in insurance contracts is to be accorded its commonly used meaning unless it is apparent from reading the instrument as a whole that a different or special meaning was intended.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b472-5\"><em>Prestige, </em>99 F.3d at 1350.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-6\">The Michigan Supreme Court has explained that the term \u201caccidental bodily injury\u201d carries its ordinary, plain meaning in an insurance-disability contract. <em>See Nehra v. Provident Life &amp; Accident Ins. Co., </em>454 Mich. 110, 559 N.W.2d 48, 51 (1997). To ascertain the ordinary meaning of the term \u201caccidental bodily injury,\u201d we can look to dictionaries, including legal dictionaries. <em>Minges Creek, LLC v. Royal Ins. Co. Of Am., </em>442 F.3d 953, 956 (6th Cir.2006). According to Black\u2019s Law Dictionary, \u201caccidental injury\u201d means \u201c[a]n injury resulting from external, violent, and unanticipated causes; esp., a bodily injury caused by some external force or agency operating contrary to a person\u2019s intentions, unexpectedly, and not according to the usual order of events.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (9th ed.2009). \u201cBodily injury\u201d means \u201cphysical damage to a person\u2019s body.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b472-8\">Insurance-law treatises provide further clarification. \u201cInfirmity or other result of the normal aging process is not an accident or accidental, nor are clearly biological, medical conditions, despite the fact that they are known as an \u2018accident\u2019 in the medical community.\u201d 10 Couch on Insurance \u00a7 139.14 (3d ed.1997). \u201cA cerebrovascular accident, for example, is a stroke, and rarely meets the definition of an accident for purposes of insurance law unless some external trauma can be shown to have produced it.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 141:4.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-9\">Reading all of this together, we conclude that the term \u201caccidental bodily injury\u201d in this policy refers to physical damage to the body caused by an external, violent, unanticipated cause that is neither clearly medical nor biological. A stroke, or a \u201ccerebrovascular accident\u201d in medical terminology, is not an \u201caccidental bodily injury\u201d under the policy simply because the word \u201caccident\u201d appears in the medical term. King\u2019s disability-inducing stroke can only be an accidental bodily injury if it were caused by an \u201cexternal, violent, unanticipated cause.\u201d Accordingly, we must determine whether King has shown the existence of a genuine issue of material fact regarding whether his stroke was caused by an external, violent, unanticipated cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-10\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-11\">The district court, adopting the recommendation of the magistrate judge, held that there was no genuine issue of material fact regarding the cause of King\u2019s disability. The court concluded that \u201cthere simply is no evidence, medical or otherwise, (from the 1970s) in the record indicating that Dr. King\u2019s fall on December 8, 1977 had anything to do with his stroke on December 9, 1977 \u2014 or that Dr. King believed the events were even remotely relat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>ed.\u201d Accordingly, because it found no genuine issue of fact, the report recommended (and the district court agreed) that summary judgment was appropriate. This was error.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-5\">To be sure, much of the evidence in the record suggests that for nearly 30 years, the parties proceeded as if King\u2019s stroke were the result of sickness, and not accidental bodily injury. The original physician\u2019s report, the statement of claim forms, the notes from King\u2019s interview during Mass Life\u2019s investigation, Dr. Schriner\u2019s letter of clarification describing the incident,- and the 1987 letter from Mass Life all support the conclusion that King\u2019s disability was caused by sickness. But not all of the evidence points this way. In opposing Penn Life\u2019s summary-judgment motion, King offered the affidavit of Dr. Christopher Sweet, a neuro-radiologist that had reviewed King\u2019s medical records from the time of his stroke. Having reviewed those records, Dr. Sweet concluded that \u201cbased upon reasonable medical probability,\u201d King\u2019s brain injury was caused by a combination of his \u201cneurological-symptoms producing\u201d fall in the snow on December 8, 1977, the high altitude in Alta, and a \u201cdeep bleed in the small vessels on the left side\u201d of King\u2019s brain. Dr. Sweet\u2019s conclusion was based on the fact that King did no.t have \u201cany underlying symptoms or signs of an impending stroke\u201d before he fell in the snow, leading him to believe that King\u2019s stroke first manifested itself when his face and limbs went numb after his fall.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-6\">This conclusion contradicts Penn Life\u2019s claim that King\u2019s disability was caused by sickness. Accordingly, Dr. Sweet\u2019s affidavit creates a genuine issue of material fact regarding whether King\u2019s disability was caused by sickness or accidental bodily injury. If it accepted Dr. Sweet\u2019s opinion about the role of the fall, a jury would have sufficient evidence to find that King\u2019s stroke was caused by an external, violent, unanticipated cause (i.e., an accidental bodily injury). Although Dr. Sweet\u2019s affidavit could have been more descriptive and could have included more detail about the physiology supporting his medical opinion, and although he does not address what, if anything, to make of the fact that King\u2019s father had died of a stroke at age 48 and that King\u2019s angiogram reportedly showed an arteriovenous malformation, a jury guided by cross-examination would be well-equipped to decide what caused King\u2019s disability. In other words, based on the record before us, resolving this dispute is the province of the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-8\">The district court held otherwise after it discounted and disregarded Dr. Sweet\u2019s affidavit because it was \u201csimilar to the physician opinion rejected\u201d by the court in <em>Brock v. Zurich American Insurance Co., </em>2009 WL 2244610 (E.D.Tenn., July 27, 2009) . This was improper. It is true that \u201cexpert witnesses cannot create a question of fact by simply stating conclusions on ultimate issues,\u201d <em>Worldwide Equip., Inc. v. United States, </em>605 F.3d 319, 326 (6th Cir.2010) , because \u201c[a]n expert who supplies nothing but a bottom line supplies nothing of value to the judicial process,\u201d <em>Brainard v. Amer. Skandia Life Assurance Corp., </em>432 F.3d 655, 664 (6th Cir.2005) (citation omitted). But at the same time, judges must not independently weigh the evidence in the record or make credibility determinations at the summary-judgment stage. <em>See Anderson, </em>477 U.S. at 249, 106 S.Ct. 2505; <em>Moldowan v. City of Warren, </em>578 F.3d 351, 374 (6th Cir.2009). Rather, we must determine whether there is a genuine issue for trial. <em>Anderson, </em>477 U.S. at 249, 106 S.Ct. 2505. Viewed through the proper lens, Dr. Sweet\u2019s affidavit is not merely conclusory and differs from those we have deemed insufficient to defeat summary judgment. In <em>Brainard, </em>for example, we affirmed the district court\u2019s rejection of an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>expert affidavit regarding the existence of an agency relationship because it \u201cemploy[ed] broad and dramatic language without substance\u201d and contained no \u201cmeaningful analysis or reasoning\u201d <em>Id. </em>And in <em>Lindstrom v. A-C Product Liability Trust, </em>424 F.3d 488, 493 (6th Cir.2005), an asbestos-related products-liability case, we approved the district court\u2019s rejection of an expert affidavit that \u201c[did] not provide a basis for a causation finding as to any particular defendant.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Moreover, the disregarded physician\u2019s opinion in <em>Brock </em>appeared in the form of a letter (not a sworn affidavit) that contradicted some of the same physician\u2019s conclusions in an earlier letter. <em>See Brock, </em>2009 WL 2244610, at *2.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-4\">By contrast, Dr. Sweet\u2019s affidavit was sufficiently reasoned and detailed to create a dispute of material fact. Dr. Sweet stated that he had reviewed the relevant medical records and described the specific factors and symptoms (or absence thereof) that supported his conclusion. His opinion was not conclusory: he did not definitively claim that King\u2019s stroke was caused by his fall. Rather, he concludes that, \u201cbased upon reasonable medical probability,\u201d the stroke was caused by several factors, including King\u2019s fall in the snow. Indeed, Dr. Sweet\u2019s affidavit was similar in form and substance to those that courts have deemed sufficient to defeat a motion for summary judgment. <em>See, e.g., Ambrosini v. Labarraque, </em>966 F.2d 1464, 1470 (D.C.Cir.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b474-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-6\">For the foregoing reasons, we REVERSE the judgment of the district court and REMAND the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b469-8\">.
