Cunningham, </em>554 F.3d 703, 707 (7th Cir.2009), even for defendant Stephen Golden whose Guideline range was lowered to 360 months to life from a range of life. And despite Golden\u2019s argument to the contrary, a district judge is permitted to leave a sentence alone, <em>id., </em>which is what the judge did in Golden\u2019s case. The district judge did not abuse his discretion in handling Golden\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion, especially in light of Golden\u2019s admitted incidents of prison misconduct. And, like his decision whether to grant a sentence reduction, the district judge\u2019s decision not to conduct a hearing is committed to his discretion. <em>United States v. Young, </em>555 F.3d 611, 615 (7th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b532-20\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
