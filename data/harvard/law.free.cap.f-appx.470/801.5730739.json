Stat. \u00a7 760.10. Lyons argues that she was prejudiced by the denial of her motions to amend the scheduling order and to defer consideration of the motion of the County for summary judgment. Lyons also argues that the County retaliated against her for filing complaints with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and the Internal Affairs office and that the County violated the Disabilities Act by requesting that she submit to a medical examination. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-8\">The district court did not abuse its discretion when it denied Lyons\u2019s motions to amend-the scheduling order and to defer consideration of the motion for summary judgment. Lyons sought additional time purportedly to conduct discovery, but Lyons had been dilatory in preparing for trial. Lyons\u2019s counsel of eight months withdrew based on Lyons\u2019s refusal to \u201cfulfill ... obligations\u201d or to communicate with him. After counsel withdrew and before Lyons filed her motions, Lyons failed to comply with an order to notify the district court whether she would proceed <em>pro se </em>or retain new counsel; she twice failed to appear for a deposition; and she neglected to hire new counsel until after the deadline for discovery and pre-trial pleadings had expired and after the County had moved for summary judgment. Lyons failed to establish that there was \u201cgood cause\u201d to amend the scheduling order, Fed.R.Civ.P. 16(b)(4), or that her circumstances warranted that the district court defer consideration of the motion for summary judgment, <em>see Wright v. Revere Copper and Brass Inc., </em>836 F.2d 505, 507 n. 4 (11th Cir.1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b831-10\">Even if we assume, as the district court did, that Lyons proved a prima facie case of retaliation, Lyons failed to prove that the legitimate reason proffered for her termination was pretextual. <em>See Brown v. Ala. Dep\u2019t of Transp., </em>597 F.3d 1160, 1181-82 (11th Cir.2010); <em>Holly v. Clairson Indus., LLC, </em>492 F.3d 1247, 1255 (11th Cir.2007). The County presented evidence that Lyons was terminated for insubordination after she refused to comply with an order to provide medical information in an evaluation to determine her fitness to resume work. Lyons argues that the \u201creason[ ] proffered ... for [her] termination ... [is] rife with errors and inconsistencies,\u201d but the County introduced the testimony of Dr. Dasalia Soto that she could not evaluate Lyons\u2019s fitness for duty because Lyons had refused to execute a release to grant access to her medical history. Lyons conceded in her response to the motion for summary judgment that she had refused to execute the release. Lyons failed to present evidence that would create a genuine issue of material fact about whether the reason for her termination was discriminatory or unworthy of credence. <em>See Rioux v. City of Atlanta, Ga., </em>520 F.3d 1269, 1278 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b831-11\">Lyons also failed to establish a prima facie case of discrimination under the Disabilities Act. Under the Act, a covered employer may not require a medical examination or make medical inquiries regarding an employee\u2019s disability \u201cunless such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"804\">*804</page-number>examination or inquiry is shown to be job-related and consistent with business necessity.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12112(d)(4)(A). The County had reason to question Lyons\u2019s fitness to work as a fire code inspector. In 2005, Lyons was injured on the job and suffered a herniated disk and dislocated vertebrae, after which she required periodic reassignments to light duty and obtained a medical leave of absence between December 1, 2006, and July 13, 2007, for \u201curgent medical care.\u201d The order to undergo a fitness evaluation was indisputably related to a legitimate concern of the County about whether Lyons could perform her job-related duties.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-4\">We AFFIRM the summary judgment in favor of the County.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
