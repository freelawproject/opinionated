Miranda argues that the BIA erred in finding that the Department of Homeland Security (\u201cDHS\u201d) proved his removability by clear and convincing evidence because the DHS failed to prove his offense was not \u201ca single offense involving possession for one\u2019s own use of 30 grams or less of marijuana.\u201d <em>See </em>INA \u00a7 237(a)(2)(B)\u00a9. Miranda also argues that his 2000 conviction for transportation of marijuana is invalid for immigration purposes under <em>Lujan-Armendariz v. INS, </em>222 F.3d 728 (9th Cir.2000), <em>overruled by Nunez-Reyes v. Holder, </em>646 F.3d 684 (9th Cir.2011) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b608-8\">Miranda\u2019s first argument fails because the record of conviction shows Miranda was charged and pled nolo contende-</p>\n<p id=\"b608-12\">re to <em>transporting </em>marijuana rather than possessing it, giving it away, or doing something else with it. Transportation of marijuana is not \u201ca single offense involving possession for one\u2019s own use of 30 grams or less of marijuana.\u201d <em>See </em>INA \u00a7 237(a)(2)(B)(i). Transportation and possession of marijuana are separately delineated offenses under California law, and possession for one\u2019s own use is not an essential element of transportation. <em>Compare </em>CH &amp; SC \u00a7 11357, <em>with </em>CH &amp; SC \u00a7 11360; <em>see also People v. Rogers, </em>5 Cal.3d 129, 95 Cal.Rptr. 601, 486 P.2d 129, 131 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b608-13\">Miranda\u2019s second argument fails because transportation of a controlled substance is not an equivalent or lesser offense than simple possession. Prior to <em>Nunez-Reyes, </em>the law in this circuit provided that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b608-14\">a state conviction cannot be used for immigration purposes if the alien can show that (1) the conviction was his first offense; (2) he had not previously been accorded first offender treatment; (3) his conviction was for possession of drugs, or an equivalent or lesser charge such as possession of drug paraphernalia; and (4) he received relief under a state rehabilitative statute.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b608-15\"><em>Rice v. Holder, </em>597 F.3d 952, 956 (9th Cir.2010) (internal quotation marks, emphasis, punctuation, and citation omitted), <em>overruled by Nunez-Reyes, </em>646 F.3d 684. <em>Nunez-Reyes </em>overruled this law prospectively but left it intact according to its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>terms for aliens, like Miranda, who were convicted prior to the decision\u2019s publication date. <em>See Nunez-Reyes, </em>646 F.3d at 694. However, <em>Nunez-Reyes </em>retroactively overruled <em>Rice\u2019s </em>holding that the offense of being under the influence of a controlled substance is a lesser offense than simple possession. <em>Nunez-Reyes, </em>646 F.3d at 695 n. 7. The en banc Court in <em>Nunez-Reyes </em>distinguished <em>Rice </em>from earlier cases such as <em>Ramirez-Altamirano v. Holder, </em>563 F.3d 800 (9th Cir.2009), <em>Cardenas-Uriarte v. INS, </em>227 F.3d 1132 (9th Cir.2000), and <em>Lujan-Armendariz, </em>222 F.3d 728, noting that in the earlier cases \u201cit was clear that the conviction was for a \u2018lesser offense\u2019 because the alien was convicted of a single crime that carried a lesser penalty than the crime of simple possession.\u201d <em>Nunez-Reyes, </em>646 F.3d at 695. \u201cBeing under the influence is not a lesser offense to simple possession,\u201d we reasoned, \u201cbecause it arguably is more serious than mere possession\u201d in that it \u201calters one\u2019s sober state of mind and carries an immediate risk of dangerous behavior, which mere possession does not necessarily create.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b609-5\">At the least, transportation of a controlled substance \u201carguably is more serious than mere possession.\u201d <em>See id. </em>Transportation of marijuana under CH &amp; SC \u00a7 11360(a) carries a punishment of imprisonment for two, three, or four years, whereas possession of marijuana under CH &amp; SC \u00a7 11357(b) or (c) is punished by a fine of not more than $100 (\u00a7 11357(b)), or six months in county jail and/or a f\u00edne of not more than $500 (\u00a7 11357(c)). Furthermore, transportation of marijuana carries risks not created by mere possession, such as the risk that use of drugs in vehicles will cause traffic hazards and accidents. <em>See Rogers, </em>95 Cal.Rptr. 601, 486 P.2d at 133.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-9\">Miranda\u2019s Petition for Review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b608-10\"> \u00b6-his disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9 th Cir. R. 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b608-11\">. During his removal proceedings, Miranda\u2019s conviction of transportation of marijuana was expunged by the State court, a form of \u201crelief under a state rehabilitative statute.\u201d <em>See Rice v. Holder, </em>597 F.3d at 956. Expungement alone, where the alien was convicted of a crime more serious than possession of drugs or an equivalent or lesser charge, does not qualify the alien for relief from an Order of Removal. <em>Ramirez-Castro v. INS, </em>287 F.3d 1172, 1174 (9th Cir.2002).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
