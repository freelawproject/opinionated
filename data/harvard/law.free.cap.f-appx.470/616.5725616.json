Our jurisdiction is governed by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for an abuse of discretion, <em>Toufighi v. Mukasey, </em>538 F.3d 988, 992 (9th Cir.2008), and we deny in part and dismiss in part the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-22\">The BIA did not abuse its discretion by denying petitioners\u2019 motion to reopen as untimely where the motion was filed over four years after the BIA\u2019s final order, <em>see </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(2), and petitioners failed to establish changed circumstances in Indonesia to qualify for the regulatory exception to the time limit for filing motions to reopen, <em>see </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(3)(ii); <em>see also Malty v. Ashcroft, </em>381 F.3d 942, 945 (9th Cir.2004) (\u201cThe critical question is ... whether circumstances have changed sufficiently that a petitioner who previously did not have a legitimate claim for asylum now has a well-founded fear of future persecution.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b644-23\">We lack jurisdiction to review petitioners\u2019 contention that the disfavored group analysis applies to the changed circumstances exception to the time limit for motions to reopen because the issue was not exhausted before the BIA. <em>See Barron v. Ashcroft, </em>358 F.3d 674, 678 (9th Cir. 2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b644-24\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED in part; DISMISSED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b644-27\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
