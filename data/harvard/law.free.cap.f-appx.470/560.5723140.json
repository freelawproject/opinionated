See Fed. R.App. P. 34(a)(2). Accordingly, we deny petitioner\u2019s request for oral argument.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b589-7\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"Ab2\">Juan Carlos Delgado-Lorenzo, a native and citizen of Guatemala, petitions for review of a Board of Immigration Appeals order dismissing his appeal from an immigration judge\u2019s decision denying his application for asylum, withholding of removal and protection under the Convention Against Torture (CAT). Our jurisdiction is governed by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We dismiss in part and deny in part the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"A5VT\">We lack jurisdiction to review the Board\u2019s discretionary determination that petitioner failed to show exceptional and extremely unusual hardship to his U.S. citizen child. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B); <em>Mendez-Castro v. Mukasey, </em>552 F.3d 975, 979 (9th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b589-11\">Substantial evidence supports the Board\u2019s denial of asylum and withholding of removal because petitioner failed to show that the guerillas\u2019 attempt to recruit him was on account of a protected ground. <em>See INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 481-82, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992) (holding that forced recruitment alone is not enough to show persecution on account of political opinion). Because the Board properly denied relief for lack of a nexus, we need not address petitioner\u2019s contention that he suffered past persecution or has a well-founded fear of future persecution by forces the Guatemalan government is unable or unwilling to control.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-14\">Substantial evidence also supports the Board\u2019s denial of CAT relief based on the Board\u2019s finding that petitioner did not establish a likelihood of torture by, at the instigation of, or with the consent or acquiescence of the Guatemalan government. <em>See Arteaga v. Mukasey, </em>511 F.3d 940, 948-49 (9th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b589-15\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DISMISSED in part; DENIED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b589-12\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
