We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence the agency\u2019s factual findings, <em>Tekle v. Mukasey, </em>533 F.3d 1044, 1051 (9th Cir.2008), and we grant the petition for review and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-11\">The IJ denied Qian\u2019s claims based on an adverse credibility determination. The IJ\u2019s finding that Qian\u2019s wife\u2019s letter omits the central points of Qian\u2019s claim is not supported because it is based on a mischaracterization of the letter. <em>See id. </em>at 1052-55 (adverse credibility finding not supported where IJ mischaracterized evidence and characterized evidence out of context). The IJ\u2019s finding that Qian was often non-responsive is not supported because the IJ did not identify any instances in the record where Qian refused to answer questions. <em>See Garrovillas v. INS, </em>156 F.3d 1010, 1014-15 (9th Cir.1998) (IJ \u201cfail[ed] to specify any particular instances in his testimony when [petitioner] refused to answer questions\u201d). In addition, the inconsistency in Qian\u2019s testimony regarding his wife\u2019s employment and termination from employment was an incidental misstatement. <em>See Li v. Holder, </em>629 F.3d 1154, 1158 (9th Cir.2011) (\u201cA minor inconsistency or incidental misstatement that does not go to the heart of an applicant\u2019s claim does not support an adverse credibility determination.\u201d). Finally, the IJ\u2019s two implausibility findings are based on improper speculation. <em>See Zhou v. Gonzales, </em>437 F.3d 860, 865 (9th Cir.2006) (implausibility that applicant would risk privileged position in society to smuggle illegal material into China for a friend was based on speculation). Because the IJ\u2019s reasons for finding Qian not credible are not supported by substantial evidence, Qian is not required to corroborate his claim with additional evidence. <em>See Salaam v. INS, </em>229 F.3d 1234, 1239 (9th Cir.2000). Accordingly, substantial evidence does not support the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination. <em>See Tekle, </em>533 F.3d at 1055.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-14\">We grant the petition for review and remand to the agency.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-15\">PETITION FOR REVIEW GRANTED; REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b689-12\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
