We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence factual findings and review de novo legal determinations. <em>Wakkary v. Holder, </em>558 F.3d 1049, 1056 (9th Cir.2009). We deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-9\">Rumbayan does not challenge the agency\u2019s dispositive finding that his asylum application is time-barred. <em>See Martinez-Serrano v. INS, </em>94 F.3d 1256, 1259-60 (9th Cir.1996) (issues not specifically raised and argued in a party\u2019s opening brief are waived). Accordingly, Rumbayan\u2019s asylum claim fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-10\">Rumbayan testified that he was never injured in Indonesia on account of his race or religion, and does not contend he suffered past persecution, but he argues he fears future persecution on the basis of his Christian faith and his marriage to an ethnic Chinese Christian woman. Substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s conclusion that Rumbayan failed to demonstrate a clear probability of future persecution because he does not present sufficient evidence of an individualized risk of harm. <em>See Lolong v. Gonzales, </em>484 F.3d 1173, 1179 (9th Cir.2007) (\u201ca general, undifferentiated claim\u201d does not suffice); <em>Wakkary, </em>558 F.3d at 1059-60 (\u201c[a]n applicant for withholding of removal will need to adduce a considerably larger quantum of individualized-risk evidence to prevail than would an asylum applicant\u201d). Therefore, Rumbayan\u2019s withholding of removal claim fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-13\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b619-11\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provid<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>ed by 9th Cir.
