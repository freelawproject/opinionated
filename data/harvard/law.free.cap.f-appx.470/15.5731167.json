Rock challenges his conviction of assault in the second degree, N.Y. Penal L. \u00a7 120.05(2), and his sentence principally to seven years\u2019 imprisonment. He argues that the in-court identifications made by two witnesses were tainted by an unduly suggestive show-up and were not independently reliable, and that the state court\u2019s decision to permit the in-court identifications therefore constituted an unreasonable application of federal law as established in <em>Neil v. Biggers, </em>409 U.S. 188, 198-200, 93 S.Ct. 375, 34 L.Ed.2d 401 (1972) (setting standards for considering the likelihood of misidentification following an unduly suggestive identification procedure). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts, procedural history, and issues on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-17\">\u201cWe review a district court\u2019s decision to grant or deny a habeas petition <em>de novo </em>and its findings of fact for clear error.\u201d <em>Hemstreet v. Greiner, </em>491 F.3d 84, 89 (2d Cir.2007). Having reviewed the record of the proceedings below, we affirm the district court\u2019s judgment for substantially the same reasons articulated by the district court in its opinion and by Magistrate Judge Debra Freeman in her report and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>recommendation, which the district court adopted in full. <em>See Rock v. Conway, </em>No. 09 Civ. 3883(RMB)(DF), 2010 WL 3528871 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 30, 2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b45-5\">Under <em>Biggers, </em>\u201cthe factors to be considered in evaluating the likelihood of misidentification include [1] the opportunity of the witness to view the criminal at the time of the crime, [2] the witness\u2019 degree of attention, [3] the accuracy of the witness\u2019 prior description of the criminal, [4] the level of certainty demonstrated by the witness at the confrontation, and [5] the length of time between the crime and the confrontation.\u201d 409 U.S. at 199-200, 93 S.Ct. 375. A federal court may grant habeas corpus only if the decision of the Appellate Division, the last state court decision on the merits of Rock\u2019s claim, was \u201ccontrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States,\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(1), or \u201cwas based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the State court proceeding,\u201d <em>id. </em>\u00a7 2254(d)(2). Moreover, \u201c[t]he more general the rule, the more leeway [state] courts have in reaching outcomes in case-by-case determinations.\u201d <em>Yarborough v. Alvarado, </em>541 U.S. 652, 664, 124 S.Ct. 2140, 158 L.Ed.2d 938 (2004). Accordingly, the \u201cunreasonable application\u201d standard is especially deferential where state courts apply open-ended, multifactor tests like that in <em>Biggers. See, e.g., Brisco v. Ercole, </em>565 F.3d 80, 89-90 (2d Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b45-6\">Rock has failed to demonstrate, as he must, that the <em>Biggers </em>standard or other federal law \u201cwas applied in a way that was objectively unreasonable,\u201d not just arguably incorrect as established by the Supreme Court of the United States. <em>See Dunlap v. Burge, </em>583 F.3d 160, 165-66 (2d Cir.2009). We agree with the district court that several of the <em>Biggers </em>factors favored admission of the witnesses\u2019 in-court identifications. The first factor\u2014 \u201cthe opportunity of the witness to view the criminal at the time of the crime,\u201d <em>Biggers, </em>409 U.S. at 199, 93 S.Ct. 375 \u2014 favored admission because both witnesses had multiple (albeit relatively brief) opportunities to view the assailant, and the attack took place in \u201cdaylight conditions.\u201d The second <em>Biggers </em>factor \u2014 the degree of attention paid by a witness at the time of the crime, <em>id. </em>\u2014 also favored admission, because, as the Appellate Division concluded, both witnesses focused intently on the attacker because of his strange behavior, and were highly attentive when they viewed him. The fifth <em>Biggers </em>factor \u2014 \u201cthe length of time between the crime and the confrontation,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 199-200, 93 S.Ct. 375 \u2014 likewise weighed in favor of admitting the in-court identifications.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-8\">The third <em>Biggers </em>factor \u2014 \u201cthe accuracy of the witness\u2019 prior description of the criminal,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 199, 93 S.Ct. 375 \u2014 may have cut against admission of the in-court identifications, as the witnesses\u2019 initial descriptions of the defendant were somewhat vague, generalized, and lacking in detail, and the hearing court noted that the initial description of the attacker was \u201ca composite description of both\u201d witnesses. Further, the fourth <em>Biggers </em>factor, \u201cthe level of certainty demonstrated by the witness[es]\u201d in identifying Rock \u201cat the confrontation,\u201d <em>id., </em>was different for the two witnesses. While one \u2014 the victim \u2014 had trouble eliminating another suspect and was more hesitant in identifying Rock as her attacker, the other witness immediately identified Rock as the assailant after he removed his hat and shirt. However, \u201c[n]one of [the <em>Biggers </em>] factors standing alone is dispositive of the existence of independent reliability; instead, reliability is assessed in light of the totality of the circumstances.\u201d <em>Brisco, </em>565 F.3d at 89 (internal quotation marks omitted). The Appellate Division plainly conducted a <em>Big</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number><em>gers </em>balancing analysis, and it concluded that the factors indicating reliability of the witnesses\u2019 identifications outweighed the factors that might suggest a possible misidentification. Thus, even if the fourth and fifth factors weighed against admissibility, we cannot say that the Appellate Division\u2019s affirmance of the trial court\u2019s decision to permit the in-court identifications was an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-4\">We have considered Rock\u2019s other arguments and find them to be without merit. Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
