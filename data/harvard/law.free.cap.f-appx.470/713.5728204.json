O\u2019BRIEN, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b742-8\">Jackie Petty, an Oklahoma state prisoner, wants to appeal from the denial of his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 habeas petition. He challenges the effectiveness of trial counsel, claims the trial court erred when it denied his request for a mistrial, and contends the evidence was insufficient to support his conviction. The district court concluded he did not make \u201ca substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right,\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2). Because that decision is not even debatably incorrect we deny his request for a Certificate of Appealability (COA).</p>\n<p id=\"b742-9\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b742-10\">A jury rejected Petty\u2019s claim of self-defense and determined he was guilty of the first-degree murder of his brother. On September 18, 2007, Petty was sentenced to life imprisonment with the possibility of parole. The Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals (OCCA) affirmed his conviction. <em>Petty v. State, </em>No. F-2007-961 (Okla.Crim.App. Feb. 26, 2009). Petty unsuccessfully applied for post-conviction relief in the state district court and on appeal. <em>Petty v. State, </em>No. CF-2005-6689 (Okla. Dist. Ct. June 16, 2010); <em>Petty v. State, </em>No. PC-2010-681 (Okla.Crim.App. Sept. 15, 2010). He then filed his federal habeas petition which alleged his trial counsel was ineffective; (1) counsel\u2019s efforts were focused on defending himself from criminal and disciplinary charges rather than Petty\u2019s defense, and (2) counsel unreasonably pursued an \u201call or nothing\u201d defense by rejecting a manslaughter instruction. He also claimed his trial was fundamentally unfair because jurors were intimidated by the court\u2019s investigation of a reported attempt to bribe a juror. Finally, he contended the evidence was insufficient to sustain the charge of first degree murder. The magistrate judge recommended Petty\u2019s habeas petition be denied. Over Petty\u2019s objections and after a de novo review, the district court adopted the magistrate\u2019s reasoning and denied Petty\u2019s petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-13\">The district court determined the OCCA was not unreasonable in concluding trial counsel\u2019s strategy to limit the jury\u2019s options to acquittal or first-degree murder was not ineffective under the deferential <em>Strickland v. Washington</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>standard. The court also found Petty\u2019s remaining theories based on his counsel\u2019s personal issues were grounded in speculation connected only by temporal proximity, and Petty had failed to present legal or factual support for this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-14\">The OCCA rejected Petty\u2019s second claim, based on the trial judge\u2019s investigation into the attempted bribery of a juror and his subsequent denial of a mistrial because the record did not support an inference that the juror in question, who was excused, related the incident to any other juror. It also found the record contained no suggestion the jury was tainted in any way \u2014 a finding which is entitled to deference. The district court held the OCCA\u2019s denial of Petty\u2019s claim was not contrary to or an unreasonable application <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"715\">*715</page-number>of clearly established Supreme Court precedent.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-5\">Finally, the OCCA rejected Petty\u2019s sufficiency-of-the-evidence claim by reasoning:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Abl\">The victim was shot three times; two of the injuries were independently fatal; one of the shots was fired downward into the top of the victim\u2019s skull at very close range. There was evidence that the shots were not fired in rapid succession. Given the number, location, and timing of the gunshot wounds, a rational trier of fact could find, beyond a reasonable doubt, that [Petty] ... acted with malice aforethought.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b743-6\">(Summary Opinion at 2.) The district court held the OCCA\u2019s determination was reasonable. It denied Petty\u2019s request for an evidentiary hearing because Petty\u2019s \u201cconclusory requests fall short of the standards that would entitle him to an evidentiary hearing and because [his] claims can be resolved on the record.\u201d (App. at 49.)</p>\n<p id=\"b743-7\">Following Petty\u2019s notice of appeal, the court denied a COA. Petty now renews his request for a COA with this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-8\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b743-9\">A COA is a jurisdictional prerequisite to our review of a petition for a writ of habeas corpus. <em>Miller-El v. Cockrell, </em>537 U.S. 322, 336, 123 S.Ct. 1029, 154 L.Ed.2d 931 (2003). We will issue a COA \u201conly if the applicant has made a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2). To make such a showing, an applicant must demonstrate \u201cthat reasonable jurists could debate whether (or, for that matter, agree that) the petition should have been resolved in a different manner or that the issues presented were adequate to deserve encouragement to proceed further.\u201d <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000) (quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b743-10\">We have thoroughly reviewed the entire record as well as Petty\u2019s combined brief and request for a COA. We conclude the OCCA\u2019s decision was not \u201ccontrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States\u201d nor did it \u201cresult[] in a decision that was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the State court proceeding.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d). We agree with the district court\u2019s adjudication of the remaining claims; they are either procedurally barred or Petty failed to show they satisfied the \u201chighly deferential\u201d standard applied to the ineffective assistance of counsel claims. <em>See Harrington v. Richter, - </em>U.S. -, -, 131 S.Ct. 770, 788, 178 L.Ed.2d 624 (2011) (quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b743-12\">We DENY a COA and DISMISS this matter.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b742-11\">. <em>Strickland v.
