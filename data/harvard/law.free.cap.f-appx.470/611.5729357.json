Our jurisdiction is governed by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for an abuse of discretion, <em>Malty v. Ashcroft, </em>381 F.3d 942, 945 (9th Cir.2004), and we deny in part and dismiss in part the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-8\">The BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying Kaur\u2019s motion to reopen as untimely because the motion was filed over two years after the BIA\u2019s final order, <em>see 8 </em>C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(2), and Kaur failed to present material evidence of changed circumstances in India to qualify for the regulatory exception to the time limitation for filing motions to reopen, <em>see </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(3)(h); <em>see also Toufighi v. Mukasey, </em>538 F.3d 988, 996-97 (9th Cir.2008) (underlying adverse credibility determination rendered evidence of changed circumstances immaterial).</p>\n<p id=\"b640-9\">We reject Kaur\u2019s contentions that the BIA applied an incorrect standard, ignored evidence, or failed to adequately explain its decision. <em>See Najmabadi v. Holder, </em>597 F.3d 983, 990-91 (9th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b640-10\">The BIA did not abuse its discretion in construing Kaur\u2019s challenge to the underlying adverse credibility determination as a motion to reconsider and denying it as untimely. <em>See Mohammed v. Gonzales, </em>400 F.3d 785, 793 (9th Cir.2005) (BIA may construe motions based on their underlying purpose); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(b) (a motion to reconsider must specify errors of law or fact in the BIA\u2019s prior decision and be filed within 30 days of that decision).</p>\n<p id=\"b640-13\">We decline to reconsider Kaur\u2019s challenge to the immigration judge\u2019s adverse credibility determination because this court already decided the issue in <em>Kaur v. Gonzales, </em>235 Fed. Appx. 425 (9th Cir.2007); <em>see also Merritt v. Mackey, </em>932 F.2d 1317, 1320 (9th Cir.1991) (explaining that under the \u201claw of the case doctrine,\u201d one panel of an appellate court will not reconsider questions that another panel has decided on a prior appeal in the same case).</p>\n<p id=\"b640-14\">Finally, we lack jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s decision not to exercise its sua sponte power to reopen proceedings. <em>See Mejia-Hernandez v. Holder, </em>633 F.3d 818, 823-24 (9th Cir.2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b640-15\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED in part; DISMISSED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b640-11\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
