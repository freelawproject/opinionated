Matsumoto of the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b50-4\">SUMMARY ORDER</p>\n<p id=\"b50-5\">Plaintiff Keith Turner appeals from an award of summary judgment to defendants NYU Hospitals Center, NYU Medical Center, NYU School of Medicine, and NYU Health System (collectively, \u201cNYUHC\u201d), on his claims of discrimination and retaliation under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, <em>see </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2000e-2(a), 2000e-3(a); 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981; the New York State Human Rights Law, <em>see </em>N.Y. Exec. Law \u00a7 296; and the New York City Human Rights Law, N.Y.C. Admin. Code \u00a7 8-107. We review an award of summary judgment <em>de novo, </em>resolving all ambiguities and drawing all inferences in favor of the nonmovant, and we will affirm only if- no genuine issues of material fact exist and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. <em>See Nagle v. Marron, </em>663 F.3d 100, 104-05 (2d Cir.2011). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and the record of prior proceedings, which we reference only as necessary to explain our decision to affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-7\">1. <em>Federal Claims: Discrimination and Retaliation</em></p>\n<p id=\"b50-8\">Turner contends that record evidence would permit a reasonable jury to find that he was terminated from his position as day manager of NYUHC\u2019s Building Services Department on June 14, 2004, because of his white race or American national origin, and in retaliation for complaining to a human resources official about ongoing discrimination in his department. Turner\u2019s claims under Title VII and 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981 are evaluated under an identical burden-shifting analysis. <em>See Ruiz v. County of Rockland, </em>609 F.3d 486, 491 (2d Cir.2010). Furthermore, his Title VII discrimination and retaliation claims are analyzed under the same principles. <em>See Hicks v. Baines, </em>593 F.3d 159, 164 (2d Cir.2010) For purposes of deciding this appeal, we assume that Turner established <em>pnma facie </em>cases of discrimination and retaliation. The burden therefore shifted to NYUHC to submit evidence of a legitimate, non-discriminatory or non-retaliatory justification for the adverse actions against Turner. <em>See Tepperwien v. Entergy Nuclear Operations, Inc., </em>663 F.3d 556, 568 n. 6 (2d Cir.2011) (retaliation claims); <em>Leibowitz v. Cornell Univ., </em>584 F.3d 487, 498-99 (2d Cir.2009) (discrimination claims).</p>\n<p id=\"b50-12\">Here, NYUHC has put forward evidence of two legitimate justifications for Turner\u2019s termination: (1) Turner\u2019s day manager position was eliminated as part of a hospital-wide effort to reduce all departments\u2019 personnel budgets by 2%; and (2) NYUHC promoted Robert Stephen to a consolidated day manager position, following the remaining manager\u2019s termination for cause, because he was more qualified and commanded a lesser salary than Turner. <em>See Leibowitz v. Cornell Univ., </em>584 F.3d at 504 (accepting budgetary constraints as legitimate business reason for terminating employee); <em>Byrnie v. Town of Cromwell, </em>243 F.3d 93, 102 (2d Cir.2001) (stating that defendants sustained burden by submitting evidence that hired applicant was more qualified than plaintiff). The burden then returned to Turner to introduce evidence that NYUHC\u2019s proffered justifications were pretext for discrimination, <em>see Leibowitz v. Cornell Univ., </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>584 F.3d at 499, or that retaliation was a substantial reason for his termination, <em>see Tepperwien v. Entergy Nuclear Operations, Inc., </em>663 F.3d at 568 n. 6. Turner posits that he carried this burden, precluding an award of summary judgment to NYUHC on his discrimination and retaliation claims. Like the district court, we conclude otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-5\">a. <em>Budget Constraints</em></p>\n<p id=\"b51-6\">Turner claims that he submitted evidence that Udel DeGazon, the Building Services Department\u2019s director at the time of his termination, had been planning to fire him before NYUHC issued the June 1, 2004 directive for a 2% cut in personnel budgets. Turner points to a May 25, 2004 email that DeGazon sent to an NYUHC compensation analyst requesting an analysis of supervisors\u2019 and managers\u2019 compensation in the Building Services Department, but omitting Turner\u2019s salary from the data to be analyzed. According to Turner, this omission shows that DeGazon was intending to fire him before NYUHC\u2019s budget crunch. The record does not permit a reasonable factfinder to draw such an inference. DeGazon\u2019s email was sent to verify whether any Building Services employees were being paid below the market rate and, therefore, deserved a raise. De-Gazon referenced only one manager in his email, Frank Trujillo, who was being paid approximately $54,000 after 25 years\u2019 service, which was $6,000 less than Turner\u2019s salary, despite Turner\u2019s mere two years\u2019 service. The record is thus clear that DeGazon did not seek a raise for Turner because he was already the highest-paid manager in his department. There is no evidence suggesting that DeGazon omitted Turner\u2019s salary data because he was planning to fire him, and a jury could only infer as much by resorting to speculation, which is insufficient to defeat summary judgment. <em>See Hicks v. Baines, </em>593 F.3d 159, 166 (2d Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b51-7\">Nor can pretext be inferred from evidence that DeGazon and Hilda Pineda, the Building Services Department\u2019s Associate Director, coded Turner\u2019s termination in his employee file as a \u201cLayoff \u2014 Reorganization,\u201d rather than a \u201cLayoff \u2014 Lack of Funds.\u201d The chosen code does not suggest that Turner was laid off for non-budgetary reasons. On the contrary, it accurately reflects that Turner\u2019s management position was eliminated in the course of restructuring the Building Services Department in order to reduce personnel costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-8\">Turner submits that pretext is evident from the fact that DeGazon, who is black and of St. Lucian origin, promoted Stephen, who is of the same race and nationality, to the remaining consolidated day manager position, rather than assign Turner to that job. The evidence is uncontradicted, however, that Stephen\u2019s salary upon promotion to day manager was approximately $13,000 less than Turner\u2019s had been, a savings significantly greater than the five weeks\u2019 earnings NYUHC paid Turner when he was terminated. Stephen\u2019s promotion is therefore consistent with NYUHC\u2019s budgetary justification.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-9\">DeGazon\u2019s attempt to obtain raises for his staff in May 2004 does not undermine the budgetary rationale for the elimination of Turner\u2019s position because DeGazon took that action before June 1, 2004, when NYUHC ordered the staff reductions. DeGazon\u2019s and Pineda\u2019s raises upon promotion to director and associate director of the Building Services Department, respectively, are also consistent with the budgetary rationale: DeGazon and Pineda were paid less than the Department\u2019s preceding director and associate director, thus saving money for the Building Services Department. Turner offered no other evidence from which a jury could infer that the budgetary justification for his termination <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>was unfounded. <em>Cf Leibowitz v. Cornell Univ., </em>584 F.3d at 504-05 (concluding that defendants were not entitled to summary judgment because plaintiff submitted evidence showing that \u201cthe budgetary exigencies cited by defendants were not so dire as to warrant\u201d plaintiffs termination).</p>\n<p id=\"b52-4\">b. <em>Turner\u2019s and Stephen\u2019s Relative Qualifications</em></p>\n<p id=\"b52-5\">We further conclude that Turner failed to submit evidence that would permit a reasonable jury to find that DeGazon\u2019s and Pineda\u2019s judgment that Stephen was more qualified than Turner was a pretext for discrimination or retaliation. Although Turner received a \u201cmeets performance standards\u201d rating in his September 2003 review, App. 256, that review indicated that Turner did not meet expectations in thirteen out of sixty-two reviewed areas. In the written section of Turner\u2019s performance review, Pineda expressed hope that \u201cwith time [Turner would] be able to fulfill this position,\u201d but noted that he \u201cneed[ed] to adjust to the fast pace and the demands of an institution this size,\u201d id. at 255, and that she and DeGazon expected him to improve his performance \u201cimmediately,\u201d id. at 254. The record shows that Turner failed to do so and repeatedly violated departmental procedures for assigning shifts to employees; tracking the department\u2019s beepers, keys, and beds; responding promptly to pages; and keeping up-to-date records. By June 2004, after approximately nine months of non-improvement and the elimination of Turner\u2019s day manager position, DeGazon and Pineda determined that Turner was not qualified to assume the remaining consolidated day manager position, which would entail greater responsibilities. Thus, following termination, DeGazon and Pineda marked Turner as \u201cineligible for rehire\u201d because of \u201c[u]nacceptable level of performance,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 854, which was consistent with DeGazon\u2019s and Pineda\u2019s practice for former employees who underperformed but were not necessarily terminated for cause. In contrast to Turner, Stephen was deemed at least an adequate candidate for the consolidated day manager position based on his seven years\u2019 experience as a Building Services Department supervisor, his prior management experience, and his last positive performance review.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-7\">While Turner plainly disagrees with these relative assessments, to defeat summary judgment on the ground of pretext or that retaliation was a substantial reason for his termination, Turner had to adduce evidence that his qualifications were \u201cso superior\u201d to Stephen\u2019s that \u201cno reasonable person, in the exercise of impartial judgment, could have chosen [Stephen] over the plaintiff for the job in question.\u201d <em>Byrnie v. Town of Cromwell, 243 F.3d </em>at 103 (internal quotation marks omitted). The record evidence does not permit Turner to satisfy that standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-8\">Nothing in the record suggests that Turner\u2019s and Stephen\u2019s performance evaluations were erroneous, or that DeGazon\u2019s and Pineda\u2019s judgment that Stephen was more qualified than Turner was pretextual. Former Building Services Department Director Joey Morelos\u2019s subjective belief that Turner was meeting expectations is consistent with Turner\u2019s 2003 performance evaluation, but Morelos did not cite any objective reasons why DeGazon and Pineda, Turner\u2019s direct supervisors with the greatest familiarity with the quality of his work, were wrong in determining that Turner had not improved enough to meet expectations in 2004. At most, Morelos\u2019s deposition testimony shows that reasonable people could disagree as to Turner\u2019s qualifications relative to Stephen\u2019s, which is insufficient to establish a triable question of pretext. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b52-9\">Further, Turner\u2019s assertion that NYUHC violated its own internal procedures when it failed to give him preference <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>over Stephen for the day manager position is belied by the record. Turner was only entitled to preference if his supervisors determined that he was eligible for rehire, which they did not. Nor does DeGazon\u2019s statement to Reginald Odom, NYUHC\u2019s Vice President of Employee and Labor Relations, describing Turner as \u201call right\u201d and \u201cokay\u201d contradict the negative aspects of Turner\u2019s performance history. Odom Dep. at 67. DeGazon made those statements during a human resources investigation of the Building Services Department, and they were clearly meant to convey that DeGazon had an amicable relationship with Turner, not that Turner was performing his job well or to signify his ability to assume the greater responsibilities of the consolidated position.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-5\">Finally, Turner cites a passage from the conclusion of DeGazon\u2019s deposition where DeGazon answered \u201cyes\u201d when asked if he had wanted Stephen to be promoted to day manager in 2002, when Turner was hired, and whether he had \u201cwaited for an opportunity to find a way to get Mr. Turner ... out of the way.\u201d DeGazon Dep. at 157. Immediately before answering this question, however, DeGazon denied that he had ever \u201csought to eliminate Mr. Turner from NYU because [he] didn\u2019t want [Turner] in the first place,\u201d or that he \u201cpromoted Mr. Stephen because he\u2019s black and from St. Lucia.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 156-57. Rather, DeGazon consistently stated that he wanted to promote Stephen because he believed Stephen to be more qualified than Turner, and he thought Stephen should have been promoted in 2002. Thus, the record at most shows that DeGazon had long been of the view that Stephen was more qualified than Turner for the manager position. Because the evidence does not demonstrate Turner\u2019s clear superiority, a reasonable jury could not infer from DeGazon\u2019s maintenance of this view through the challenged dismissal that this reason was a pretext for discrimination or that retaliation was a substantial reason for Turner\u2019s termination.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-8\">c. <em>Circumstantial Evidence of Pretext</em></p>\n<p id=\"b53-9\">We reject Turner\u2019s argument that he can withstand summary judgment based on other circumstantial evidence of pretext, <em>i.e., </em>DeGazon\u2019s firing of two other white managers for cause. Whether or not those terminations were discriminatory or retaliatory, they would not undermine NYUHC\u2019s demonstration that Turner\u2019s job was eliminated in response to legitimate budgetary exigencies,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and that Stephen was promoted to the remaining consolidated day manager position because his salary was lower and DeGazon and Pineda perceived him as more qualified than Turner. Nor would the other employees\u2019 terminations establish a pattern within the Building Services Department from which a jury could infer that Turner was the victim of discrimination or retaliation. <em>See Pollis v. New Sch. for Soc. Research, </em>132 F.3d 115, 121-22 (2d Cir.1997) (reversing jury award on plaintiffs claim of discrimination based on small sample size of comparators, which diminished likelihood that \u201cobserved pattern is attributable to other factors and accordingly the less persuasive the inference of discrimination to be drawn from it\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b53-10\">2. <em>State and Municipal Claims</em></p>\n<p id=\"b53-11\">Turner\u2019s state and municipal discrimination and retaliation claims \u201cform part of the same case or controversy,\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1367, and are analytically identical to Turner\u2019s federal claims, <em>see Petrosino v. Bell Atl, </em>385 F.3d 210, 220 n. 11 (2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>Cir.2004); <em>Torres v. Pisano, </em>116 F.3d 625, 629 n. 1 (2d Cir.1997). In such circumstances, the district court did not abuse its discretion in exercising supplemental jurisdiction to grant summary judgment to NYUHC on the state and municipal law claims. <em>See Valencia ex rel. Franco v. Lee, </em>316 F.3d 299, 305 (2d Cir.2003). Nor did the district court err in determining that Turner\u2019s claims fail under state and municipal law, as the record conclusively shows that Turner was neither discriminated nor retaliated against, but was terminated for legitimate reasons relating to the Building Services Department\u2019s budget and his relative qualifications for the consolidated day manager position. <em>See Fincher v. Depository Trust &amp; Clearing Corp., </em>604 F.3d 712, 723 (2d Cir.2010) (discussing different standards under state and municipal law, and concluding that defendant was entitled to summary judgment under both).</p>\n<p id=\"b54-4\">3. <em>Evidentiary Decisions</em></p>\n<p id=\"Ah\">We further identify no abuse of discretion in the district court\u2019s construal of Turner\u2019s September 21, 2010 letter as a motion to strike Pineda\u2019s declaration and accompanying exhibits, and the district court\u2019s denial of that motion. <em>See Staehr v. Hartford Fin. Servs. Grp., Inc., </em>547 F.3d 406, 425 (2d Cir.2008). Nor did the district court abuse its discretion in treating Turner\u2019s re-litigation of those issues in his opposition to summary judgment as a motion for reconsideration, and then in denying that motion. <em>See Priestley v. Headminder, Inc., </em>647 F.3d 497, 501-02 (2d Cir.2011). In discovery, Turner did not seek the information in the Pineda declaration regarding NYUHC\u2019s previous decisions to rehire white and nonwhite employees, and did not ask Pineda or DeGazon about this at their depositions. Thus, the district court did not err in determining that the Pineda declaration and attached exhibits were not documents wrongly withheld in discovery. <em>See Demery v. Extebank Deferred Compensation Plan (B), </em>216 F.3d 283, 286 (2d Cir.2000) (holding that district court did not abuse discretion in granting summary judgment when plaintiffs did not seek discovery relied upon by defendants in their motion).</p>\n<p id=\"b54-6\">4. <em>Conclusion</em></p>\n<p id=\"b54-7\">We have considered Turner\u2019s remaining arguments and conclude that they are without merit. Accordingly, the order of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b53-6\">.
