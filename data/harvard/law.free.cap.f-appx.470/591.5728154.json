We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence factual findings, <em>Nagoulko v. INS, </em>333 F.3d 1012, 1015 (9th Cir.2003), and deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-11\">The record does not compel the conclusion that Dudkevich demonstrated a sufficiently individualized threat of persecution to establish a well-founded fear of persecution. <em>See Lolong v. Gonzales, </em>484 F.3d 1173, 1181 (9th Cir.2006) (the recurrence of sporadic violence against Chinese Christians in Indonesia was insufficient to demonstrate eligibility for asylum \u201cabsent an individualized risk of persecution or a pattern and practice of persecution\u201d). Accordingly, Dudkevich\u2019s asylum claim fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-17\">Because Dudkevich failed to establish eligibility for asylum, she necessarily failed to meet the higher standard of eligibility for withholding of removal. <em>See Zehatye v. Gonzales, </em>453 F.3d 1182, 1190 (9th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b620-18\">Finally, substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s denial of CAT relief because Dudkevich failed to establish it is more likely than not she will be tortured upon her return to Belarus. <em>See Wakkary v. Holder, </em>558 F.3d 1049, 1067-68 (9th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b620-19\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b620-28\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
