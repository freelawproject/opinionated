Because the Petitioners fail to raise any arguments that meaningfully challenge the propriety of the Board\u2019s denial of their motion to reopen in the argument section of their brief, we find that they have failed to preserve any issues for review. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 28(a)(9)(A) (\u201c[T]he argument ... must contain ... appellant\u2019s contentions and the reasons for them, with citations to the authorities and parts of the record on which the appellant relies.\u201d); <em>Edwards v. City of Goldsboro, </em>178 F.3d 231, 241 n. 6 (4th Cir.1999) (\u201cFailure to comply with the specific dictates of [Rule 28] with respect to a particular claim triggers abandonment of that claim on appeal.\u201d). Accordingly, we deny the petition for review for the reasons stated by the Board. <em>See In re: Show Wen Lin </em>(B.I.A.
