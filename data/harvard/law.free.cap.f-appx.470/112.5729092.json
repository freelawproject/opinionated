Decker appeals the district court\u2019s order affirming the magistrate judge\u2019s judgment of conviction after a bench trial finding Decker guilty of one count of driving under the influence of alcohol, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 13 (2006), assimilating Va.Code Ann. \u00a7 18.2-266(h) (2009), and one count of depredation of government property, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1361 (2006). He was sentenced to three years\u2019 probation. Finding no reversible error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-23\">We have considered the claims raised in Decker\u2019s brief. Decker claims there was insufficient evidence to convict him of operating a motor vehicle under the influence. We find that the evidence was sufficient to sustain the conviction. <em>See Glasser v. United States, </em>315 U.S. 60, 80, 62 S.Ct. 457, 86 L.Ed. 680 (1942).</p>\n<p id=\"b140-24\">Accordingly, we affirm. We deny Decker\u2019s pro se motions to file supplemental briefs. We deny counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>fore the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
