The parties are familiar with the facts underlying the appeal and thus we do not include them here.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-5\">Jimenez challenges his sentence of twenty months in custody for a conviction of being a deported alien found in the United States. He pleaded guilty unconditionally, and received a two-level sentencing reduction under United States Sentencing Guidelines (USSG) \u00a7 3El.l(a). Jimenez argues on appeal that the government was required to move for a third one-level sentencing reduction under USSG \u00a7 3El.l(b), because Jimenez\u2019s failure to waive his right to appeal his sentence was an illegitimate and therefore arbitrary basis to refuse to move for the additional reduction. This argument is foreclosed by <em>United States v. Medina-Beltran, </em>542 F.3d 729, 731 (9th Cir.2008), and <em>United States v. Johnson </em>581 F.3d 994, 1002 (9th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b709-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b708-29\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9 th Cir.

Medina-Beltran, </em>542 F.3d 729, 731 (9th Cir.2008), the government\u2019s decision not to move for an additional one-level sentence reduction pursuant to United States Sentencing Guidelines \u00a7 3El.l(b) because Jimenez did not waive his right to appeal his sentence, was not arbitrary. I write separately to voice my disagreement with the discretion afforded to the government in deciding whether to move for an additional one-level sentence reduction under \u00a7 3El.l(b) by this Court\u2019s decisions in <em>Medina-Beltran, United States v. Johnson, </em>581 F.3d 994, 1002-07 (9th Cir.2009) and <em>United States v. Espinoza-Cano, </em>456 F.3d 1126, 1135-1137 (9th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b709-9\">A defendant who clearly demonstrates acceptance of responsibility for the offense and who, prior to any reduction for such acceptance, has an offense level of sixteen or greater, is eligible for a one-level reduction \u201cupon motion of the government stating that the defendant has assisted authorities in the investigation or prosecution of his own misconduct by timely notifying authorities of his intention to enter a plea of guilty, thereby permitting the government to avoid preparing for trial and permitting the government and the court to allocate their resources efficiently.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3El.l(b). This Court has determined that the government may withhold filing a motion for a one-level reduction under \u00a7 3E1.1 when a defendant refuses to waive his right to appeal his sentence because \u201c[w]hen \u00a7 3El.l(b) speaks of conserving government resources in the \u2018prosecution\u2019 of the defendant\u2019s \u2018misconduct,\u2019 it means more than simply trial preparation. \u2018Prosecution\u2019 is commonly understood to encompass the entirety of the criminal proceedings in a particular case until judgment is final and certain.\u201d <em>Johnson, </em>581 F.3d at 1002. With due respect to the previous panels who have interpreted \u00a7 3El.l(b) in this manner, I do not read \u00a7 3E 1.1(b) so broadly.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-11\">Instead, I find that the plain language of \u00a7 3El.l(b), as well as the relevant application notes, indicate that the guideline is concerned with the efficient allocation of trial \u2014 not appellate \u2014 resources. Specifically, the guideline requires that the government state in its motion that the defendant \u201cassisted authorities in the investigation or prosecution of his own misconduct <em>by </em>timely notifying authorities of his intention to enter a plea of guilty.\u201d (emphasis added). While there are numerous ways in which a defendant might aid in the investigation or prosecution of his own misconduct, pleading guilty in a timely manner is the only action contemplated by the guideline that would war<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"682\">*682</page-number>rant a one-level reduction. Stated otherwise, entry of a timely guilty plea is the only action required of a defendant to qualify for a one-level reduction. <em>See United States v. Divens, </em>650 F.3d 343, 348 (4th Cir.2011) (\u201cCertainly, \u2018timely\u2019 entry of a \u2018plea of guilty\u2019 does not require the execution of an appellate waiver; rather it entails only an unqualified \u2018confession of guilt in open court.\u2019\u201d (quoting <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>1152 (6th ed.1990))); <em>see also Johnson, </em>581 F.3d at 1008 (Smith, J., concurring) (\u201c[T]he section contemplates that the means by which the defendant both saves trial preparation and permits efficient resource allocation, is through a timely guilty plea.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b710-4\">Furthermore, while the guideline does require that a defendant\u2019s plea permit \u201cthe government and court to allocate their resources efficiently,\u201d this clause is relevant to the timeliness of the plea, not to whether the plea contains an appellate waiver. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3El.l(b). First, this phrase is immediately preceded by the text, \u201cthereby permitting the government to avoid preparing for trial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Second, had Congress been concerned with appellate resources, it would not have limited its concern to the resources of a singular \u201ccourt,\u201d but instead would have referred to the ability of \u201ccourts\u201d to efficiently allocate them resources. <em>See Divens, </em>650 F.3d at 348 (\u201cHad Congress also intended to conserve appellate court resources, it would have referred to \u2018courts,\u2019 not \u2018the court.\u2019 \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b710-5\">Finally, the relevant application notes, which are binding on courts\u2019 guideline interpretations, offer further support that \u00a7 3El.l(b) only addresses the allocation of trial resources. <em>See United States v. Sarbia, </em>367 F.3d 1079, 1084 (9th Cir.2004) (\u201c[Ajpplication notes are binding on the courts in their construction of the Sentencing Guidelines.\u201d). Specifically, the notes explains that to qualify for a reduction under \u00a7 3El.l(b), the defendant must \u201chave notified authorities of his intention to enter a plea of guilty at a sufficiently early point in the process so that the government may avoid preparation <em>for trial </em>and the court may schedule its calendar efficiently.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3El.l(b) cmt. (n.6) (emphasis added). While the text of the guideline uses the ambiguous term \u201cprosecution,\u201d the specific reference to trial preparation and the absence of any mention of the appeal process in these notes indicates that a defendant\u2019s plea must only permit the government to avoid allocating resources for trial preparation.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-7\">This Court has previously noted that the Prosecutorial Remedies and Other Tools to End the Exploitation of Children Today Act of 2003 (\u201cPROTECT Act\u201d), Pub.L. No. 108-21, \u00a7 401(g), 117 Stat. 650, 671-72 (2003), altered \u00a7 3Bl.l(b) by making \u2018the third level reduction subject to the discretion of the government, rather than mandatory, upon a timely plea of guilty.\u2019 <em>Johnson, </em>581 F.3d at 1005-06 (quoting <em>Espinoza-Cano, </em>456 F.3d at 1137). While the PROTECT Act did transfer discretion from the trial court to the government by requiring a government motion as a prerequisite for granting a one-level reduction under \u00a7 3El.l(b), I do not agree that it authorized the government to exercise this discretion for reasons unrelated to the timeliness of a plea. Instead, the purpose for the transfer of this discretion was simply to recognize that the government is best situated to determine whether a plea is sufficiently timely to avoid trial preparations. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3El.l(b), cmt. (n.6) (\u201cBecause the Government is in the best position to determine whether the defendant has assisted authorities in a manner that avoids preparing for trial, an adjustment under subsection (b) may only be granted upon a formal motion by the Government at the time of sentencing.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b711-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"683\">*683</page-number>I do not dispute that the government has a legitimate interest in efficiently allocating the resources used in defending appeals. I simply do not believe that this legitimate governmental interest is within the discretion afforded the government in determining whether to move for a one-level reduction under \u00a7 3El.l(b). Thus, were I writing on a blank slate, I would hold that the government acted arbitrarily by not moving for a one-level reduction under \u00a7 3E1.1 because Jimenez refused to waive his right to appeal his sentence.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
