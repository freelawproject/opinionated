The district court imposed a nonguidelines sentence of 60 months of imprisonment. Evans appeals his sentence, arguing that the district court erred: (1) by finding that he had obstructed the administration of justice under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1; (2) by denying him a reduction in his offense level based on his acceptance of responsibility under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1; and (3) by imposing an unreasonable sentence. We AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-15\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b369-16\">Evans was indicted for three counts of bank fraud, nine counts of wire fraud, and one count of access device fraud. The charges related to Evans\u2019s writing worthless checks to two banks, defrauding an electronic payment processor of debit and credit cards, and using an access device without authorization and with the intent to defraud. As part of the scheme, Evans, doing business as Evans Consolidated Industries (ECI), obtained an account with Elavon, an electronic payment processor of debit and credit cards, by representing that ECI was a retail business that sold miscellaneous oil company parts and accessories. Evans then processed non-existent sales using invalid credit cards. After his account was put in collection due to unpaid processing fees, Evans claimed that he had to change ECI\u2019s bank accounts due to a break-in at their office. The funds were not repaid and ECI\u2019s account was closed. About two months later, Evans obtained a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>new merchant account from Elavon by providing different bank information. He then submitted fraudulent payment requests using valid credit card information. When most of these charges were disputed, Elavon lost $88,609.29 because ECI\u2019s designated bank account did not have funds to satisfy these chargebacks.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-4\">Evans was originally released on bond, but the government moved to revoke his bond due to his commission of new criminal conduct. Evans had executed a contract to purchase a house in Bossier City, Louisiana, for $359,000. Evans represented that he had cash available to close the sale and produced a fraudulent proof of funds document purportedly from Bank of Nova Scotia. Prior to and on the day of closing, Evans continued to represent that he had sufficient funds to purchase the house, stating that the funds had been wired to another bank, which had placed a hold on the funds, but that the funds had cleared and he would deliver a certified cashier\u2019s check at closing. He did not deliver such a check, and the title company and seller withdrew from the deal. The government also noted in the motion to revoke that Evans had not complied with the court\u2019s order to pay $1,000 a month to help defray the cost of his appointed attorney. The district court granted the government\u2019s motion to revoke bond and also granted the government\u2019s motion for a psychiatric exam of Evans to determine whether he was competent to proceed to trial in light of his refusal to meet with his attorney and to participate in his defense. Evans was determined competent to stand trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-5\">Thereafter, Evans pleaded guilty to count 10 of the indictment, which charged him with wire fraud in the amount of $18,500 for one of the fraudulent credit card charges made through Elavon. As part of the plea agreement, the government stated that it was moving, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3El.l(b), for an extra one-point reduction in Evans\u2019s offense level \u2014 if the district court calculated it at 16 levels or greater \u2014 due to his assistance to authorities in the investigation by timely notifying them of his intention to enter a guilty plea. The government also agreed to dismiss the remaining 12 counts of the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-7\">The Presentence Report (PSR) recommended an adjustment for obstruction of justice based on Evans\u2019s providing false information to the probation officer during the presentence interview. According to the probation officer, Evans stated that, through ECI, he was in the process of obtaining a $20 million contract from Globalstar, an international telecommunications company. Evans originally indicated that he was involved in developing satellite technology for this company, but when questioned regarding his lack of background in such technology, he indicated that the contract was to construct buildings in India and other countries to house telecommunications equipment. Evans admitted that he had no background as a general contractor, but stated that he was in the process of obtaining a contractor\u2019s license. The probation officer contacted Marty Nielsen, a representative of Globalstar, who verified that he had contact with Evans via telephone and e-mails, but stated that no contract had been discussed or agreed upon. The representative indicated that Evans had sought a l%-2% security fee for the construction project to begin.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-8\">While Evans was free on bond, he also attempted to acquire a $10 million Cessna Citation Xjet. During the negotiations for this transaction, Evans provided a fraudulent balance confirmation notice from Wachovia Bank representing that he had over $98 million available for immediate use. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>Evans told the probation officer that he intended to use funds from the contract with Globalstar to facilitate the purchases of the house and aircraft. However, the probation officer noted that, in light of the fact that there was no such contract, Evans should have known that he did not have access to funds that would have enabled him to purchase either the house or the jet. This representation and the representation that Evans was in the process of obtaining a $20 million contract were the two false statements on which the probation officer relied in recommending the enhancement for obstruction of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-5\">Further, the probation officer found that Evans did not qualify for a downward adjustment for acceptance of responsibility because he had not voluntarily terminated or withdrawn from criminal conduct. Given a base offense level of seven, an upward adjustment of six levels based on the amount of loss attributable to Evans ($48,-090.05), and a two-level increase for obstruction of justice, Evans\u2019s base offense level was 15. Evans had zero criminal history points, which placed him in criminal history category I. This resulted in an advisory guidelines range of 18-24 months of imprisonment. The statutory maximum was 30 years. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1343.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-6\">Evans filed objections to the PSR, arguing that the adjustment for obstruction of justice was not warranted because the information Evans provided regarding the contract was not false or material. Evans also argued that he should receive the adjustment for acceptance of responsibility because he did not engage in criminal conduct in violation of his plea agreement, and he timely notified the government of his intent to plead guilty. In response to Evans\u2019s objections, the government wrote in support of the PSR and stated that a nonguidelines sentence was warranted under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). The district court overruled the objections, noting that Evans had tried to purchase the house and the jet while he was out on bond and that he had initiated contact with Globalstar regarding a $20 million contract when he did not have the background, the equipment, or the means to provide such services. The court found that Evans had continued to engage in criminal activity after being indicted and released on bond and that this was inconsistent with the acceptance of responsibility. After considering the factors in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), the district court imposed a nonguidelines sentence of 60 months of imprisonment and five years of supervised release. The court noted the lengths to which Evans had gone in stringing others along, including inventing people and financial documents, and stated that he exhibited \u201cplain, simple crookedness.\u201d Evans timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-8\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b371-9\">A. Obstruction of Justice</p>\n<p id=\"b371-10\">Evans argues that the district court erred in finding that he obstructed justice under \u00a7 3C1.1. More specifically, the court ruled that Evans had provided the probation officer with materially false information during the presentenee investigation. Whether the district court correctly interpreted \u00a7 3C1.1 is a legal question that is reviewed de novo, whereas the district court\u2019s finding that Evans obstructed justice is a factual finding that is reviewed for clear error. <em>See United States v. Huerta, </em>182 F.3d 361, 364 (5th Cir.1999). A factual finding is not clearly erroneous if it is plausible in light of the record as a whole. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b371-11\">Pursuant to \u00a7 3C1.1, a two-level increase in the defendant\u2019s offense level is warranted if \u201cthe defendant willfully obstructed or impeded, or attempted to obstruct or impede, the administration of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>justice with respect to the investigation, prosecution, or sentencing of the instant offense of conviction\u201d and this conduct related to his offense of conviction and any relevant conduct, or to a closely related offense. The commentary to \u00a7 3C1.1 specifically provides that such conduct includes \u201cproviding materially false information to a probation officer in respect to a presentence or other investigation for the court.\u201d \u00a7 301.1, comment. (n.4(H)). However, the commentary excludes providing \u201cincomplete or misleading information, not amounting to a material falsehood,\u201d with respect to a PSR. \u00a7 3C1.1, comment. (n.5(C)). \u201cMaterial evidence\u201d is defined as \u201cevidence, fact, statement, or information that, if believed, would tend to influence or affect the issue under determination.\u201d \u00a7 3C1.1, comment, (n.6). This Court has noted that there is a \u201clow threshold of materiality\u201d in this context. <em>United States v. Ahmed, </em>324 F.3d 368, 373 (5th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b372-4\">During the presentence interview, Evans told the probation officer that his company was in the process of obtaining a $20 million contract with Globalstar, an international telecommunications company. Initially, Evans represented to the probation officer that \u201che was involved with the development of satellite technology\u201d for Globalstar. However, after Evans admitted that he had no background in satellite technology, he changed his story and stated that the contract actually involved building multiple structures to house telecommunications equipment in India and other countries. Evans admitted that he had no experience working as a general contractor but claimed that he had recently begun the process of obtaining a contractor\u2019s license. Evans further told the probation officer that he had planned to use the proceeds from this contract to pay for a house and an aircraft.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> After interviewing Evans, the probation officer contacted Marty Nielsen, a representative of Globalstar. Nielsen verified that he had communicated with Evans via telephone and email; however, no contract had been discussed. Evans had requested a security fee to begin a construction project. The probation officer\u2019s investigation \u201crevealed that the defendant did not possess the means, equipment or ability to accomplish this project.\u201d The probation officer con-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>eluded that Evans appeared to be \u201cfraudulently soliciting funds for work he had no intention of completing.\u201d The district court adopted the PSR.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">Evans first contends that the government did not introduce any evidence supporting the adjustment and that the only evidence on which the district court relied in sentencing him was the PSR, which did not have sufficient indicia of reliability. This argument is without merit. \u201cAs a general rule, a PSR bears sufficient indicia of reliability, such that a sentencing judge may consider it as evidence in making the factual determinations required by the Sentencing Guidelines.\u201d <em>Huerta, </em>182 F.3d at 364. The district court may adopt the facts in the PSR if they have an adequate evidentiary basis and the defendant does not present rebuttal evidence. <em>Id. </em>Mere objections to the PSR are not competent rebuttal evidence. <em>Id. A </em>defendant bears the burden of demonstrating that the information in the PSR relied on by the district court is materially untrue. <em>United States v. Trujillo, </em>502 F.3d 353, 356 (5th Cir.2007). Although Evans objected to the conclusion in the PSR that he provided materially false information, he failed to provide any rebuttal evidence. Accordingly, the district court did not err in relying on the information in the PSR in determining that the obstruction of justice enhancement applied.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-6\">Evans contends that the information he provided the officer was neither false nor material. Instead, Evans asserted that he had simply made some poor business decisions. Both in his written objections filed below and in his appellate brief, Evans asserts that \u201c[a]ny business decisions\u201d he made \u201cshould not be equated to fraud.\u201d This assertion is puzzling in that Evans has pleaded guilty to wire fraud in the case at bar. Also, Evan has admitted to producing a fraudulent proof of funds document \u2014 purporting to originate from Bank of Nova Scotia \u2014 in an attempt to purchase a home. That conduct, which occurred while he was out on bond for the instant offense, underlies his conviction for \u201cmisdemeanor attempted felony theft\u201d in state court. Further, Evans provided a fraudulent balance confirmation notice from Wachovia Bank, representing that he had nearly $100,000,000 available in his account for immediate use in his attempt to purchase a jet.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b373-9\">Nonetheless, Evans insists that he did not provide materially false information because he admitted to the officer that he had used a fraudulent document in an attempt to purchase the house and \u201cexplored the possibility of buying an airplane.\u201d Evans does not claim, however, that he admitted to the probation officer that he used a separate, fraudulent balance confirmation in his attempt to purchase the jet. Although Evans attempted to paint these transactions simply as poor business decisions, the district court rejected that attempt, stating as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b373-10\">It\u2019s whether somebody is providing materially false information to a probation officer in respect to a presentence investigation for the Court. That\u2019s what is before us at this minute because I find that he, in respect to the contracting [with Globalstar in] India to build $20 million worth of buildings, the contract or the attempt to contract to buy a $10 million jet aircraft, this is akin to what I used to think was called the Munchausen syndrome [sic]. He\u2019s telling this probation officer stuff that\u2019s simply not true. That obstructs the writing of the Presentence Report and the information given to the Court. And I think the two <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>points is relatively well-suited to the circumstances of Mr. Evans.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b374-4\">The court then overruled Evans\u2019s objection, specifically pointing out the \u201cWachovia Bank false paper [that] said that the $98,336,441.69 ... was available as a balance confirmation.\u201d Subsequently, the court stated that \u201cfive or six months after you were indicted, you were still involved in trying to hornswoggle your way into a contract for which you were neither qualified nor prepared.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">Evans asserts that \u201c[a]t most, an argument could be made that the defendant provided incomplete or misleading information to the probation officer,\u201d which does not qualify for an enhancement under the guidelines. \u00a7 3C1.1, comment. (n.5(C)). Contrary to Evans\u2019s assertion, as quoted above, the district court expressly recognized that \u00a7 3C1.1 requires that a defendant provide \u201cmaterially false information to a probation officer.\u201d We understand the district court found that Evans made materially false representations to the probation officer regarding his attempt to purchase the aircraft. More specifically, Evans denies that he lied when he told the probation officer that he expected to pay for the jet from the proceeds of the $20 million construction contract with Globalstar. The district court did not believe Evans. Evans had no contract with Globalstar at the time he made an offer for the jet. Globalstar\u2019s representative stated that there had been no discussions involving a contract. Evans admitted that he had no background or experience in construction and that he did not have a contractor\u2019s license. There is no basis in the record for Evans to have had a legitimate belief that he could provide the services needed to obtain a $20 million contract with Globalstar. After reviewing the record, including the transcript of the sentencing hearing, we are convinced that the district court\u2019s factual finding \u201cis plausible in light of the record as a whole.\u201d <em>Huerta, </em>182 F.3d at 364. Thus, Evans has not shown that the district court\u2019s finding that Evans provided the probation officer with false information is clearly erroneous. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b374-7\">We now turn to materiality. As previously set forth, a statement is material when, \u201cif believed, [it] would tend to influence or affect the issue under determination.\u201d \u00a7 3C1.1, comment, (n.6). The government argues that Evans\u2019s misrepresentation regarding the contract was an attempt to mitigate or vitiate any claim of fraudulent conduct in connection with his attempts to purchase the jet and the house. We agree. The district court cited Evans\u2019s post-indictment fraudulent conduct as a \u201cconcern\u201d when it imposed his sentence. Indeed, the court principally relied on this conduct in choosing the above-the-guidelines sentence. It is clear that, had the district court believed Evans\u2019s statements that his conduct was not fraudulent, those statements would have tended to influence the district court\u2019s choice of sentence. We therefore conclude that Evans\u2019s lying about his post-indictment conduct was relevant to a determination of his sentence and thus material. <em>Cf. United States v. Tello, </em>9 F.3d 1119, 1122-23 (5th Cir.1993) (affirming obstruction of justice enhancement where the defendant omitted information regarding his prior criminal history); <em>see also United States v. Milton, </em>147 F.3d 414, 422 (5th Cir.1998) (affirming application of obstruction of justice enhancement where defendant failed to disclose significant assets to the probation officer). Accordingly, Evans has not shown that the district court clearly erred in applying the two-level enhancement for obstruction of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-8\">B. Acceptance of Responsibility</p>\n<p id=\"b374-9\">Evans contends that the district court erred in denying him a reduction in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>\u2022 his offense level based on his acceptance of responsibility under \u00a7 3E1.1. A defendant\u2019s offense level may be reduced by as many as three levels if the defendant \u201cclearly demonstrates acceptance of responsibility for his offense.\u201d \u00a7 3E1.1. We review a determination of acceptance of responsibility with even greater deference than under a clearly erroneous standard; the district court\u2019s ruling on acceptance of responsibility \u201cshould not be disturbed unless it is without foundation.\u201d <em>United States v. Washington, </em>340 F.3d 222, 227 (5th Cir.2003) (internal citations and quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b375-5\">The district court denied the reduction because Evans continued committing fraud \u201cwhile he was out on bond for this offense.\u201d More specifically, after Evans was indicted for the instant federal offense, he committed fraudulent conduct in an attempt to purchase a house. As a result, Evans pleaded guilty to theft in state court. During sentencing in the instant case, Evans objected to the PSR, arguing that he \u201crefrain[ed] from criminal activity after entering into the Plea Agreement, but he accepted responsibility for his criminal conduct in state court prior to entering into the Plea Agreement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b375-6\">The commentary to \u00a7 3E1.1 provides that when determining whether a defendant qualifies for a reduction based on acceptance of responsibility, it is appropriate to consider whether there had been \u201cvoluntary termination or withdrawal from criminal conduct or associations.\u201d In denying the instant reduction, the district court found that Evans \u201chasn\u2019t stopped his criminal activity while he\u2019s ... on this Court\u2019s bond. His acceptance of responsibility is totally inappropriate.\u201d Evans objected to the PSR\u2019s recommending denial of the reduction, arguing that he terminated his criminal conduct after he entered into the plea agreement. Evans clearly had not voluntarily terminated his criminal conduct because he committed fraud after being indicted for the instant offense. Indeed, Evan\u2019s criminal conduct only terminated once his bond was revoked, and he was returned to custody. Under these circumstances, the district court\u2019s decision to deny the reduction for acceptance of responsibility is not without foundation.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b375-9\">Additionally, in the plea agreement, the government had moved for Evans to receive a one-point reduction in his offense level \u201cshould that offense level be 16 or greater\u201d based on Evans\u2019s assisting the authorities in the investigation and his timely notifying the government of his intent to plead guilty. For the first time on appeal, Evans argues that the government breached the plea agreement because it argued against the reduction for acceptance of responsibility. Thus, this claim must be reviewed for plain error. <em>United States v. Puckett, </em>505 F.3d 377, 386 (5th Cir.2007). To show plain error, Evans must demonstrate: (1) error; (2) that is plain; and (3) affects substantial rights. <em>Id. </em>at 384. If these \u201cthree elements of plain error are present, relief on appeal is discretionary, not mandatory. A court of appeals should exercise its discretion only when a plain error seriously affectfs] the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation and internal quotation marks omitted) (brackets in opinion).</p>\n<p id=\"b376-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>The plea agreement contained only one reference to a reduction for acceptance of responsibility. As set forth above, the government had agreed to move for Evans to receive a one-point reduction in his offense level \u201cshould that offense level be 16 or greater.\u201d Because Evan\u2019s offense level was not 16 or greater, Evans has not shown any error was plain with respect to whether the government breached the plea agreement. Even assuming there was error that was plain, Evans \u201chas made no showing that, absent the government\u2019s recommendation, the district court would have disregarded his criminal conduct and granted the reduction for acceptance of responsibility.\u201d <em>Puckett, </em>505 F.3d at 386. Thus, he has not shown that his substantial rights were affected.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-4\">C. Reasonableness of Sentence</p>\n<p id=\"Ag3\">Evans argues that the district court abused its discretion by imposing a 60-month sentence. The probation officer calculated a guideline range of 18 to 24 months. Evans asserts that even had the district court hypothetically given him three criminal history points for both his dealings with Globalstar and his attempt to buy an airplane, this would have put him in criminal history category III, and his guidelines range still would have been only 24-30 months. He contends that he has no prior criminal history, he has no history of the use or sale of illegal drugs, and he is educated and able to be rehabilitated. Based on his circumstances, Evans asserts that the length of his sentence is unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-8\">The substantive reasonableness of a sentence is reviewed in light of the sentencing factors in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). <em>United States v. Key, </em>599 F.3d 469, 475 (5th Cir.2010); <em>United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 519-20 (5th Cir.2005). However, because Evans did not challenge the substantive reasonableness of the sentence after it was imposed, this issue is reviewable only for plain error. <em>See United States v. Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d 357, 361 (5th Cir.2009). Here, the district court expressed concern regarding Evans\u2019s continuing deceptive and criminal behavior following his indictment on thirteen charges. The court also noted the extensive and inventive nature of Evans\u2019s deception. These considerations supported an above guidelines sentence based on the nature and circumstances of the offense and the offender\u2019s characteristics, as well as the need to protect the public, to provide a just punishment, to deter Evans from future criminal conduct, and to provide restitution to victims of the offense. <em>See </em>\u00a7 3553(a). The record demonstrates that the district court properly considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b377-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>Further, despite Evans\u2019s lack of criminal history, the district court was in the best position to judge the defendant and the circumstances of the offense, the court considered the appropriate sentencing factors, and it articulated reasons for the sentence imposed. <em>See Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51-52, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007) (recognizing the district court\u2019s superior position to make the \u00a7 3553(a) determination and holding that the fact that an appellate court might have imposed a different sentence is not sufficient to reverse the district court\u2019s decision). Although Evans\u2019s sentence is two and a half times the guideline range, we have upheld more significant variances. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Brantley, </em>537 F.3d 347, 349-50 (5th Cir.2008) (upholding an upward variance to 180 months from an advisory maximum of 51 months); <em>United States v. Jones, </em>444 F.3d 430, 433, 441-42 (5th Cir.2006) (affirming an upward variance or departure to 120 months from a range of 46 to 57 months). Evans has shown no error, plain or otherwise, with respect to the substantive reasonableness of his 60-month sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-5\">III.

Additionally, Globalstar is a telecommunications company, and the contract was reportedly secured for the purpose of constructing multiple buildings in India and other countries in order to house telecommunications equipment. Contact was subsequently made with a representative of Globalstar, Marty Nielsen, who verified that he had corresponded with the defendant via telephone and e-mails, but that no contract had been discussed or agreed upon between Globalstar and the defendant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-9\">Furthermore, pursuant to the defendant's attempted acquisition of a $10,000,000.00 Cessna Citation X jet, in addition to the defendant\u2019s new conviction for Forgery on January 11, 2011, which involved the attempted purchase of a $359,000.00 house; the defendant has asserted to this officer that in both of these instances he had intended to utilize funds obtained from the reported $20,000,000.00 contract with Globalstar in order to facilitate these purchases. However, as noted above, the defendant had not obtained a multi-million dollar contract from Globalstar or any other company, and should have known that while attempting to make the above noted purchases that he did not have access to any funds which would have enabled the acquisition of a house or a Cessna jet.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b373-7\">.

And in particular, the Court will look at the kinds of sentencing available and the range established by the guidelines, but also an appreciation of the nature and circumstances of the offense, the history and characteristics of the defendant, the need to reflect [the] seriousness of the offense, and provide a just punishment, promote respect for the law. It also adds: The need to a full, adequate deterrence, that is, deterrence of any future criminal conduct. The need to protect the public from further crimes of the defendant, and the need to provide the defendant with needed educational or vocational training, medical care, or other correctional treatment in the most effective manner, to avoid unwarranted sentencing disparities between you and the other guys that I have to sentence on similar subjects, and the need to provide restitution. All of these factors in [\u00a7 ] 3553(a) have been considered.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
