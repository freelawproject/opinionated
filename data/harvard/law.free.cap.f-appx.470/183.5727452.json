The Government has moved to dismiss Simpson\u2019s appeal of the judgment of revocation as untimely.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-5\">In criminal cases, the defendant must file a notice of appeal within ten days after the entry of judgment. Fed. R.App. P. 4(b)(l)(A)(i) (applicable to notices of appeal filed before Dec. 1, 2009). With or without a motion, upon a showing of excusable neglect or good cause, the district court may grant an extension of up to thirty days to file a notice of appeal. Fed. R.App. P. 4(b)(4); <em>United States v. Reyes, </em>759 F.2d 351, 353 (4th Cir.1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b212-6\">The district court entered the judgment of revocation on October 8, 2009. Simpson filed his notice of appeal on November 19, 2009, outside of the ten-day appeal period but within the thirty-day excusable neglect period. We previously remanded this case to the district court for that court to determine whether Simpson could show good cause or excusable neglect warranting an extension of the appeal period. On remand, the district court concluded that an extension of the appeal period was not warranted. After a careful review of the record, we find no abuse of discretion in that decision. <em>See United States v. Breit, </em>754 F.2d 526, 529 (4th Cir.1985) (stating the standard of review). Accordingly, in No. 11-5029, we affirm the district court\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-7\">Because Simpson failed to file a timely notice of appeal from the district court\u2019s judgment revoking his supervised release or to obtain an extension of the appeal period, we grant the Government\u2019s motion to dismiss and supplemental motion to dismiss and dismiss the appeal in No. 09-5126. <em>See United States v. Mitchell, </em>518 F.3d 740, 744 (10th Cir.2008) (stating that the time limit in Rule 4(b) \u201cmust be enforced by th[e] court when properly invoked by the government\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b212-9\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-10\">No. 09-5126 <em>DISMISSED; </em>No. 11-5029 <em>AFFIRMED.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
