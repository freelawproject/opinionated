We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence the agency\u2019s factual findings, applying the new standards governing ad<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>verse credibility determinations created by the REAL ID Act, <em>Shrestha v. Holder, </em>590 F.3d 1034, 1039 (9th Cir.2010), and we-deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-5\">Substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s adverse credibility finding based on Duan\u2019s evasive, inconsistent account of his knowledge of illicit activities; his inconsistent account of reporting a beating; his inability to provide a consistent, coherent explanation of the hotel\u2019s finances and his ability to make payments; and the agency\u2019s negative assessment of his demeanor. <em>See Ad. </em>at 1045-48 (adverse credibility determination was reasonable under the REAL ID Act\u2019s \u201ctotality of circumstances\u201d); <em>Singh-Kaur v. INS, </em>183 F.3d 1147, 1151 (9th Cir.1999) (special deference given to credibility determinations that are based on demeanor). In the absence of credible testimony, Duan\u2019s asylum and withholding of removal claims fail. <em>See Farah v. Ashcroft, </em>348 F.3d 1153, 1156 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b679-6\">Because Duan\u2019s CAT claim is based on the same testimony found to be not credible, and he does not point to any evidence that shows it is more likely than not that he will be tortured if returned to China, his CAT claim also fails. <em>See id. </em>at 1156-57.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-7\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b678-24\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
