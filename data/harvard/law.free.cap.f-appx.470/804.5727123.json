He contends that the district court erred in applying <em>United States v. Frazier, </em>26 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"805\">*805</page-number>F.3d 110 (11th Cir.1994), as controlling precedent for the admission of \u25a0 hearsay-evidence in revocation hearings. He argues that the district court should have followed the more recent Supreme Court cases of <em>Crawford v. Washington, </em>541 U.S. 36, 124 S.Ct. 1354, 158 L.Ed.2d 177 (2004), and <em>Davis v. Washington, </em>547 U.S. 813, 126 S.Ct. 2266, 165 L.Ed.2d 224 (2006). Cespedes does not argue that the district court misapplied <em>Frazier. </em>After reviewing the record and the parties\u2019 briefs, we affirm, the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-5\">We review a district court\u2019s decision to revoke supervised release only for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Copeland, </em>20 F.3d 412, 413 (11th Cir.1994) (per curiam). \u201cWe review <em>de novo </em>the scope of constitutional rights.\u201d <em>United States v. Cantellano, </em>430 F.3d 1142, 1144 (11th Cir.2005) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b833-6\">The Supreme Court has explained that the \u201cfull panoply of rights due a defendant\u201d at trial does not apply in a supervised release revocation hearing. <em>Morrissey v. Brewer, </em>408 U.S. 471, 480, 92 S.Ct. 2593, 2600, 33 L.Ed.2d 484 (1972) (discussing a revocation of parole); <em>Copeland, </em>20 F.3d at 414 (applying <em>Morrissey </em>to revocation of supervised release). Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 32. 1(b)(2)(C) also provides that a defendant is entitled to question an adverse witness in a revocation hearing unless the court determines that the interest of justice does not require the witness to appear. The revocation hearing should be informal and flexible enough for the court \u201cto consider evidence including letters, affidavits, and other material that would not be admissible in an adversary criminal trial.\u201d <em>Morrissey, </em>408 U.S. at 489, 92 S.Ct. at 2604.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-7\">We review the admission of an absent witness\u2019s hearsay statements at a revocation hearing under the balancing test articulated in <em>Frazier, </em>26 F.3d at 112. This test requires the district court to consider the reliability of the hearsay statement and to balance the defendant\u2019s right to confront adverse witnesses against the government\u2019s asserted grounds for denying confrontation. <em>Id. </em>at 114. Cespedes requests that we overturn <em>Frazier </em>in light of <em>Crawford </em>and <em>Davis. Crawford </em>created a standard to control the admissibility of testimonial hearsay statements <em>during criminal trials. </em>541 U.S. at 53-54, 124 S.Ct. at 1365. The Supreme Court has not indicated that this standard extends to revocation hearings. Therefore, we are bound by <em>Frazier, </em>and the district court did not abuse its discretion in applying <em>Frazier.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b833-9\">Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
