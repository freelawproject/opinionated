Ripple, Circuit Judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b526-6\">PER CURIAM.</author>\n<p id=\"b526-7\">Jerry Daniel pleaded guilty to conspiracy to distribute cocaine and cocaine base, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841 and 846, and was sentenced to 90 months in prison. Daniel now appeals his sentence, arguing that the district court erroneously denied him a reduction in his offense level for acceptance of responsibility. We affirm the district court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-8\">According to the facts set forth in the plea agreement, Daniel was involved in a segment of a cocaine distribution network that revolved around his brother, Marcus Lewis. Lewis would receive between four and ten kilograms of cocaine per week and then sell smaller quantities of cocaine, \u201cin both powder and base form,\u201d to several individuals, including Daniel. Daniel admitted that he would regularly purchase \u201ccocaine or cocaine base\u201d from Lewis and distribute the drugs to others. The plea agreement did not address the drug quantities attributable to Daniel.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-9\">A probation officer prepared a presentence report (PSR), which attributed 1.2 kilograms of cocaine and two ounces (56.7 grams) of cocaine base (crack) to Daniel based on 35 drug-related phone calls that law enforcement officers intercepted between Daniel and Lewis. This yielded a marijuana equivalent of 1,374 kilograms and a base offense level of 30. The PSR awarded a three-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility, citing Daniel\u2019s agreement with the factual basis set forth in the plea agreement, his timely guilty plea, and the government\u2019s intent to move for an additional one point reduction at sentencing. <em>See </em>USSG \u00a7 3El.l(a), (b). This resulted in a total offense level of 27, which, when combined with Daniel\u2019s criminal history category of II, yielded a guideline range of imprisonment of 78 to 97 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-13\">Daniel then filed a motion for \u201cmiscellaneous relief,\u201d stating that he was not a \u201csignificant player\u201d in the conspiracy, was \u201cprimarily involved in marijuana,\u201d and should be awarded a minimal role reduction. The probation officer treated this as an untimely objection to the PSR and recommended denying the request on the ground that Daniel\u2019s role in the conspiracy was not minor or minimal relative to other participants. Daniel did not renew this objection at the sentencing hearing. Instead, he challenged the drug quantities attributed to him in the PSR, first stating that the amount of powder cocaine was overstated. In response, the government called James Hixon, a Drug Enforcement Administration task force officer, who testified that the figure in the PSR was a \u201cconservative\u201d estimate based on approximately 30 monitored telephone calls between Daniel and Lewis.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-14\">After Hixon left the stand, Daniel\u2019s counsel stated that he made a mistake earlier and that Daniel also objected to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>two ounces of crack cocaine attributed to him. According to counsel, Daniel \u201ctold [him] clearly that he had nothing to do with crack cocaine.\u201d The government recalled Hixon, who testified that the two ounces of crack cocaine were attributed to Daniel based on terminology used in two of the telephone calls between Daniel and Lewis. Hixon acknowledged, however, that he actually was \u201cnot sure one way or another\u201d whether the second call involved one ounce of crack or one ounce of powder cocaine. Daniel did not testify, but made a \u201cproffer\u201d through counsel that his involvement in the conspiracy was limited to powder cocaine. Counsel also restated his argument that the amount of powder cocaine attributed to Daniel was too high.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-5\">Based on Hixon\u2019s testimony, as well as Daniel\u2019s guilty plea to a conspiracy involving both crack and powder cocaine, the district court found that the drug quantities set forth in the PSR had been established by a preponderance of the evidence. The district court also concluded that Daniel was no longer entitled to a reduction for acceptance of responsibility because his assertion that he did not sell any crack cocaine was contrary to his admission in the plea agreement and the plea hearing \u201cthat he was involved in some quantity of crack cocaine.\u201d As a result, the district court raised Daniel\u2019s total offense level to 30, resulting in a guideline range of 108 to 135 months. After reviewing the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors, the district court varied downward from this range and imposed a sentence of 90 months of imprisonment, citing Daniel\u2019s youth, employment history, and lack, of a significant criminal record.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-6\">Daniel argues on appeal that the district court erred in denying him a reduction for acceptance of responsibility. \u201cThe district court\u2019s determination regarding acceptance of responsibility must be sustained unless clearly erroneous.\u201d <em>United States v. Angel, </em>355 F.3d 462, 476 (6th Cir.2004). A finding is clearly erroneous when we are \u201cleft with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\u201d <em>United States v. Boudreau, </em>564 F.3d 431, 435 (6th Cir.2009) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b527-8\">A defendant must demonstrate his acceptance of responsibility by a preponderance of the evidence. <em>United States v. Bacon, </em>617 F.3d 452, 458 (6th Cir.2010). A guilty plea does not automatically entitle a defendant to an acceptance of responsibility reduction. <em>See </em>USSG \u00a7 3E1.1, comment. (n.3); <em>United States v. Kathman, </em>490 F.3d 520, 524 (6th Cir.2007). Rather, entitlement to a reduction depends on \u201ctruthfully admitting the conduct comprising the offense(s) of conviction, and truthfully admitting or not falsely denying any additional relevant conduct for which the defendant is accountable under \u00a7 1B1.3 (Relevant Conduct).\u201d USSG \u00a7 3E1.1, comment. (n.l(a)). The district court\u2019s determination regarding acceptance of responsibility is entitled to significant deference. <em>Kathman, </em>490 F.3d at 524.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-9\">The district court concluded that Daniel\u2019s \u201cblanket denial of any involvement in crack cocaine\u201d contradicted his earlier sworn statements to the court, including his guilty plea to a conspiracy involving both crack and powder cocaine and his admission to the facts set forth in the plea agreement. The district court found that, based on these admissions, Daniel \u201cwas involved in some quantity of crack cocaine,\u201d and that Daniel\u2019s insistence that his involvement was limited to powder cocaine amounted to a false or frivolous denial of responsibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-10\">Whether we would have reached the same conclusion, we cannot say that it was clear error for the district court to find that Daniel failed to demonstrate acceptance of responsibility. <em>See Kathman, </em>490 F.3d at 524. Even after the district court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>observed that Daniel\u2019s acceptance of responsibility reduction was at risk, Daniel continued to deny his involvement with crack cocaine and did not make clear that he was admitting his culpability for his offense. <em>See Bacon, </em>617 F.3d at 459. Having determined that the drug quantity calculation in the PSR was supported by a preponderance of the evidence \u2014 a calculation that Daniel does not challenge on appeal \u2014 the district court reasonably concluded that Daniel was falsely denying his offense conduct and therefore was not entitled to an acceptance of responsibility reduction. <em>See, e.g., id. </em>at 458-59; <em>United States v. Wilson, 239 </em>Fed.Appx. 260, 267 (6th Cir.2007) (\u201cA defendant who is not forthcoming as to his offense conduct in an attempt to affect his sentence has not accepted responsibility.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b528-4\">Daniel\u2019s arguments to the contrary are unavailing. Daniel contends that his position at sentencing did not contradict his guilty plea admissions because the plea agreement referred to his distribution of \u201ccocaine or cocaine base\u201d rather than cocaine and cocaine base. But the offense to which Daniel pleaded guilty involved both cocaine and cocaine base. Further, the plea agreement provided that Daniel would regularly order, receive, and distribute \u201ccocaine or cocaine base\u201d that originated with Lewis. The use of the word \u201cor\u201d in this context can be reasonably interpreted to mean that Daniel\u2019s offense conduct involved both cocaine and cocaine base, and that each individual transaction involved one of the two substances. This reading of the plea agreement is reinforced by Daniel\u2019s assent at the plea hearing to the prosecutor\u2019s summary of the factual basis for Daniel\u2019s plea, which referred to \u201ccocaine and cocaine base\u201d as well as \u201ccocaine or cocaine base.\u201d Accordingly, the district court did not clearly err in determining that Daniel\u2019s denial of any involvement with crack cocaine was inconsistent with his previous admissions.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-6\">Daniel also argues that he did not personally deny any relevant conduct and that the district court should not have attributed his attorney\u2019s statements to him for purposes of evaluating his acceptance of responsibility. Daniel points to <em>United States v. Purchess, </em>107 F.3d 1261, 1269 (7th Cir.1997), in which the court held that, when an attorney raises factual challenges at a sentencing hearing, the best practice is for the district court \u201cto determine if the defendant understands and agrees with his attorney\u2019s argument before using counsel\u2019s challenge as a basis for denying the defendant a reduction for acceptance of responsibility.\u201d Relying on <em>Purchess, </em>Daniel argues that the district court should have made some effort to determine whether he understood and agreed with counsel\u2019s arguments before denying him a reduction. In <em>Purchess, </em>however, there was \u201cno link\u201d between the attorney\u2019s statements and the defendant, who, the court noted, had a limited command of the English language and a fifth grade education. <em>See id. </em>at 1268. In this case, by contrast, counsel expressly based his argument on Daniel\u2019s statements to him that he had \u201cnothing to do with crack cocaine\u201d and that \u201chis involvement was not with crack but with powder.\u201d Under these circumstances, the district court did not err by considering counsel\u2019s statements for purposes of determining whether Daniel accepted responsibility for his offense conduct. <em>See United States v. Lister, </em>432 F.3d 754, 760 (7th Cir.2005) (\u201cFrivolous challenges and denials made by one\u2019s attorney also place a deduction for acceptance of responsibility at risk.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b528-7\">Finally, Daniel asserts that he repeatedly reaffirmed his acceptance of responsibility and was simply putting the United States to its burden of proving the drug <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>quantity, which should not have jeopardized his eligibility for a reduction. <em>See United States v. Gordon, </em>495 F.3d 427, 432-33 (7th Cir.2007) (noting that \u201ca court cannot deny a reduction for acceptance of responsibility when a defendant makes a good faith challenge to a calculation of loss or drug quantity\u201d). The record demonstrates, however, that the district court denied Daniel credit for acceptance of responsibility not because he challenged the <em>amount </em>of crack and powder cocaine attributed to him for sentencing purposes, but because he argued that he should not be held accountable for <em>any </em>crack cocaine. The district court expressly acknowledged that the government bore the burden of proving the drug quantity and that Daniel could raise a challenge to the weight of the drugs without jeopardizing his acceptance of responsibility reduction. The district court noted, however, that Daniel was not simply challenging the drug quantity but was denying any involvement with crack cocaine, a position that was inconsistent with his guilty plea. Accordingly, contrary to Daniel\u2019s argument, the district court did not deny him credit for acceptance of responsibility based on his good faith challenge to the drug quantity calculation. <em>Cf. United States v. Eschman, </em>227 F.3d 886, 891-92 (7th Cir.2000). Under these circumstances, we find no clear error in the district court\u2019s denial of an acceptance of responsibility reduction.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-5\">Daniel also argues that he is entitled to a sentence reduction in light of recent guideline amendments reducing the penalties for most crack cocaine offenses. Daniel has already filed a motion in the district court for a sentence reduction under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c). Accordingly, we need not remand the case to the district court, but \u201cwill simply allow [Daniel\u2019s] motion to be adjudicated in the normal course of the district court\u2019s proceedings.\u201d <em>United States v. McClain, </em>429 Fed.Appx. 538, 543 (6th Cir.2011), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 132 S.Ct. 1091, 181 L.Ed.2d 982 (2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b529-10\">For these reasons, we affirm the district court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
