We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts, the procedural history of the case, and the issues on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"2\">*2</page-number>We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment, with the view that \u201c[sjummary judgment is appropriate only if the moving party shows that there are no genuine issues of material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d <em>Miller v. Wolpoff &amp; Abramson, L.L.P., </em>321 F.3d 292, 300 (2d Cir.2003). Additionally, we review for abuse of discretion a district court order denying reconsideration. <em>See Transaero, Inc. v. La Fuerza Aerea Boliviana, 162 </em>F.3d 724, 729 (2d Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b30-4\">Upon such review, we conclude that Sanders\u2019s appeal is without merit substantially for the reasons articulated by the district court in its decision and orders. <em>See Sanders v. N.Y.C. Dep\u2019t of Hous. Pres. and Dev., </em>No. 09-cv-4054, 2010 WL 3025651 (S.D.N.Y. July 28, 2010) and (Oct. 8, 2010). Specifically as to the due process claim, the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution provides that no state shall \u201cdeprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law.\u201d U.S. Const, amend. XIV, \u00a7 1. Sanders was not deprived of her due process rights, as she had a pre-termination hearing, there was a procedure for reinstatement while she was on her leave of absence, and the defendants provided her with sufficient documentation as to why she had been placed on her leave of absence. <em>See O\u2019Neill v. City of Auburn, </em>23 F.3d 685, 688 (2d Cir.1994). We have considered all of Sanders\u2019s remaining arguments and find them to be without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-5\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is hereby AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
