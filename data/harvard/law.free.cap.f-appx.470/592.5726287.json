We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence the agency\u2019s factual findings and review de novo its legal conclusions. <em>Benyamin v. Holder, </em>579 F.3d 970, 974 (9th Cir.2009). We deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-13\">Meza-Loreto does not contend she suffered past persecution in Mexico. Substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s finding that, even if Meza-Loreto is a member of a particular social group, her fear of future persecution is not objectively reasonable. <em>See Nagoulko v. INS, </em>333 F.3d 1012, 1018 (9th Cir.2003) (fear of future persecution too speculative). In addition, Meza-Loreto\u2019s claim that she fears persecution in Pakistan fails because that is not her country of nationality. <em>See 8 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b621-18\">Because Meza-Loreto failed to meet her burden to establish eligibility for asylum, she necessarily fails to satisfy the more stringent standard for withholding of removal. <em>See Zehatye v. Gonzales, </em>453 F.3d 1182, 1190 (9th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b621-19\">Finally, substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s denial of CAT relief because Meza-Loreto failed to demonstrate that it is more likely than not that she would face torture if returned to Mexico. <em>See Silaya v. Mukasey, </em>524 F.3d 1066, 1073 (9th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b621-20\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"AD8\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
