The district court sentenced Sobeyanis-Sanchez to seventy-six months of imprisonment and he now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-12\">We review a sentence for reasonableness, applying an abuse of discretion standard. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007); <em>see also United States v. Layton, </em>564 F.3d 330, 335 (4th Cir.2009). In so doing, we examine the sentence for \u201csignificant procedural error,\u201d including \u201cfailing to calculate (or improperly calculating) the Guidelines range, treating the Guidelines as mandatory, failing to consider the [18 U.S.C.] \u00a7 3553(a) [ (2006) ] factors, selecting a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts, or failing to adequately explain the chosen sentence.\u201d <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. 586.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-14\">Moreover, in reviewing the district court\u2019s calculations under the Guidelines, \u201cwe review the district court\u2019s legal conclusions de novo and its factual findings for clear error.\u201d <em>United States v. Manigan, </em>592 F.3d 621, 626 (4th Cir.2010) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). We will \u201cfind clear error only if, on the entire evidence, we are left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 631 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b236-15\">Under the Guidelines, a defendant who is only a \u201cminor participant\u201d in criminal activity is eligible for a two-level reduction in offense level. <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>(\u201cUSSG\u201d) \u00a7 3B1.2(b) (2011). This applies to a defendant who is \u201csubstantially less culpable than the average participant,\u201d \u201cbut whose role could not be described as minimal.\u201d USSG \u00a7 3B1.2(b), cmt. n.3(A) &amp; n.5. In deciding whether the defendant played a minor role, the \u201ccritical inquiry is thus not just whether the defendant has done fewer bad acts than his co-defendants, but whether the defendant\u2019s conduct is material or essential to committing the offense.\u201d <em>United States v. Pratt, </em>239 F.3d 640, 646 (4th Cir.2001) (noting that court must measure the defendant\u2019s individual acts and relative culpability against the elements of the offense) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>(citations omitted). The defendant has the burden of showing by a preponderance of the evidence that he played a minor role in the offense. <em>United States v. Akinkoye, </em>185 F.3d 192, 202 (4th Cir.1999). We have thoroughly reviewed the record and conclude that the district court did not clearly err in denying a minor role adjustment in offense level.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-5\">Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the district court. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
