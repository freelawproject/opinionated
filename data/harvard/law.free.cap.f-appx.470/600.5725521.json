Our jurisdiction is governed by <em>8 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence factual findings, <em>Zehatye v. Gonzales, </em>453 F.3d 1182, 1184-85 (9th Cir.2006), and we review de novo claims of due process violations in immigration proceedings, <em>Colmenar v. INS, </em>210 F.3d 967, 971 (9th Cir.2000). We deny in part and dismiss in part the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-19\">Hernandez-Martinez fears persecution from gang members because he was a police officer in El Salvador. Substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s determination that Hernandez-Martinez failed to establish the government would be unable or unwilling to protect him. <em>See Castro-Perez v. Gonzales, </em>409 F.3d 1069, 1072 (9th Cir.2005). Accordingly, Hernandez-Martinez\u2019s asylum and withholding of removal claims fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-20\">Substantial evidence also supports the agency\u2019s denial of CAT relief because Hernandez-Martinez failed to establish it is more likely than not he would be tortured at the instigation or with the acquiescence of the Salvadoran government. <em>See Silaya v. Mukasey, </em>524 F.3d 1066, 1073 (9th Cir.2008). We reject Hernandez-Martinez\u2019s contentions that the BIA applied the wrong standard and inadequately analyzed his CAT claim. <em>See Lopez v. Ashcroft, </em>366 F.3d 799, 807 n. 6 (9th Cir.2004) (agency \u201cdoes not have to write an exegesis on every contention\u201d) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b630-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>Finally, we lack jurisdiction to review Hernandez-Martinez\u2019s due process contention concerning the hearing transcript because he did not raise this issue to the BIA. <em>See Barron v. Ashcroft, </em>358 F.3d 674, 678 (9th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b630-4\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED in part; DISMISSED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b629-17\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
