Our jurisdiction is governed by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We dismiss in part and deny in part the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>We lack jurisdiction to review the Board\u2019s timeliness determination as to petitioners\u2019 asylum application, filed 19 months late. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(3); <em>Ramadan v. Gonzales, </em>479 F.3d 646, 650 (9th Cir.2007). We lack jurisdiction to consider petitioners\u2019 unexhausted contention that their untimely asylum application is excused by extraordinary or changed circumstances. <em>See Barron v. Ashcroft, </em>358 F.3d 674, 678 (9th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b583-5\">Substantial evidence supports the Board\u2019s denial of withholding of removal because petitioners failed to show their alleged persecutors threatened them on account of a protected ground. Petitioners\u2019 fear of future persecution based on an actual or imputed anti-gang or anti-crime opinion is not on account of the protected ground of either membership in a particular social group or political opinion. <em>Ramos Barrios v. Holder, </em>581 F.3d 849, 854-56 (9th Cir.2009); <em>Santos-Lemus v. Mukasey, </em>542 F.3d 738, 745-46 (9th Cir.2008); <em>see Ochave v. INS, </em>254 F.3d 859, 865 (9th Cir.2001) (\u201cAsylum generally is not available to victims of civil strife, unless they are singled out on account of a protected ground.\u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b583-6\">Substantial evidence also supports the Board\u2019s denial of CAT relief based on the Board\u2019s finding that petitioners did not establish a likelihood of torture by, at the instigation of, or with the consent or acquiescence of the El Salvadoran government. <em>See Arteaga v. Mukasey, </em>511 F.3d 940, 948-49 (9th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b583-7\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DISMISSED in part; DENIED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b582-27\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9 th Cir.
