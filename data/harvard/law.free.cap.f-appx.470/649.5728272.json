We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review de novo, <em>Bliesner v.

Kennedy, </em>771 F.2d 1244, 1253 (9th Cir.1985) (\u2018We have emphasized that, because a union balances many collective and individual interests in deciding whether and to what extent it will pursue a particular grievance, courts should accord substantial deference to a union\u2019s decisions regarding such matters.\u201d (citation and internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b678-5\">Pierce\u2019s remaining contentions are unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b677-25\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
