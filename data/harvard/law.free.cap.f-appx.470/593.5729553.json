We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence factual findings and review de novo legal deterrpinations. <em>Wakkary v. Holder, </em>558 F.3d 1049, 1056 (9th Cir.2009). We deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-5\">Weirianto does not challenge the agency\u2019s finding that he failed to timely file his asylum application or demonstrate that he qualifies for an exception to the time bar. <em>See Martinez-Serrano v. INS, </em>94 F.3d 1256, 1259-60 (9th Cir.1996) (issues not supported by argument are deemed abandoned). Accordingly, his asylum claim fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-6\">Substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s finding that the incident where two individuals smashed Weirianto\u2019s car window, injuring his hand, does not constitute persecution. <em>See Wakkary, </em>558 F.3d at 1059-60; <em>Hoxha v. Ashcroft, </em>319 F.3d 1179, 1182 (9th Cir.2003) (unfulfilled threats and one incident of physical violence did not compel a finding of past persecution). Substantial evidence also supports the agency\u2019s conclusion that Weirianto failed to demonstrate a clear probability of future persecution, because even under a disfavored group analysis, he hasn\u2019t shown a sufficient individualized risk of harm. <em>See Hoxha, </em>319 F.3d at 1184-85; <em>Wakkary, </em>558 F.3d at 1059-60 (\u201c[a]n applicant for withholding of removal will need to adduce a considerably larger quantum of individualized-risk evidence to prevail than would an asylum applicant\u201d). Accordingly, Weirianto\u2019s withholding of removal claim fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-7\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b622-28\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9 th Cir.
