In his \u00a7 2255 motion, Ewing argued that attorney Scott Brown, who allegedly participated in the representation of Ewing prior to his indictment, subsequently represented one of Ewing\u2019s co-defendants. Ewing argued that, as a result of his representation of Ewing, Brown had obtained confidential information that he later used to orchestrate the co-defendant\u2019s testimony against Ewing and to obtain a more favorable plea agreement for this co-defendant. This court granted a certificate of appealability to address whether the district court erred in failing to find that Brown had represented Ewing and whether any dual representation was a conflict of interest that adversely affected the representation.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-5\">We review the district court\u2019s factual findings underlying the denial of a \u00a7 2255 motion for clear error and its conclusions of law de novo. <em>United States v. Stricklin, </em>290 F.3d 748, 750 (5th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b423-6\">To prevail on an ineffective-assistaneeof-counsel claim based on an alleged conflict of interest, the movant \u201cmust show that his trial attorney was acting under the influence of an actual conflict of interest that adversely affected his performance at trial.\u201d <em>United States v. Infante, </em>404 F.3d 376, 390-91 (5th Cir.2005) (citing <em>Cuyler v. Sullivan, </em>446 U.S. 335, 100 S.Ct. 1708, 64 L.Ed.2d 333 (1980)). If the movant demonstrates an actual conflict that adversely affected counsel\u2019s performance, then prejudice is presumed. <em>Id. </em>at 391.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-7\">Assuming that Brown did represent both Ewing and his co-defendant, Ewing still must show that this had some adverse effect. However, Ewing has not alleged what confidential information Brown learned during his representation, what confidential information Brown passed on or used to benefit the co-defendant, what confidential information was presented by the co-defendant in his testimony at Ewing\u2019s trial, or how the use of confidential information resulted in Ewing\u2019s conviction. We have long held that \u201cspeculative and conclusory allegations ... are insufficient to raise a constitutional issue.\u201d <em>United States v. Hall, </em>455 F.3d 508, 522 (5th Cir.2006) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b423-9\">MOTION TO FILE REPLY BRIEF GRANTED; AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b422-35\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
