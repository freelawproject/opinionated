Padgett appeals an order of the District Court granting final approval to a proposed class-action settlement between a subclass of Indirect End-User Plaintiffs (\u201cIEU Plaintiffs\u201d) and defendants/appellees Cadbury Holdings, Ltd., Cadbury pic, and Cadbury Adams Canada, Inc. (\u201cCadbury\u201d). Cadbury has moved to dismiss this appeal, arguing that we lack appellate jurisdiction and that the appeal is frivolous. Although, for the following reasons, we determine that jurisdiction is properly vested in this Court, we will construe Cadbury\u2019s motion as requesting summary action under 3d Cir. LAR 27.4 and IOP 10.6 and will summarily affirm the order of the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-8\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-9\">This appeal arises out of a class action in which the defendants were accused of conspiring \u201cto fix the prices of chocolate confectionary products in the United States.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>In re Chocolate Confectionary Antitrust Litig., </em>602 F.Supp.2d 538, 548 (M.D.Pa. 2009). In August of 2011, the District Court granted preliminary motions of settlement approval for three plaintiff subclasses: direct purchasers for resale (ECF No. 1023<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>), IEU plaintiffs (ECF No. 1024), and indirect purchasers for resale (ECF No. 1025). The relevant District Court order defined the IEU class as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b96-13\">All persons and/or entities residing in the United States who indirectly purchased Chocolate Candy, for their own use and not for resale, from any Defendant or any predecessor, controlled subsidiary, affiliate or division of any Defendant, in, or for delivery into, any state that has enacted a statute extending standing to indirect purchasers asserting claims under state or local antitrust, unfair competition, consumer protection, unfair practices, trade practice, or civil conspiracy law</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b96-14\">Order Granting Preliminary Approval of Proposed Settlement with the Cadbury Defendants (\u201cIEU Preliminary Order\u201d) \u00b6 1; <em>see also </em>Settlement Agreement \u00b6 1, ECF No. 991-1. Finding that the proposed settlement was \u201csufficiently fair, reasonable and adequate to authorize dissemination of notice to the Settlement Class,\u201d the Court directed plaintiffs\u2019 counsel to publish a Detailed Notice to the settlement class in several newspapers. IEU Preliminary Order \u00b6\u00b6 10, 13. It further instructed that any member of the class who wished to object to the settlement must do so in a signed, captioned writing sent to the \u201cCourt, Plaintiffs\u2019 Counsel, and Counsel for the Cadbury Defendants <em>postmarked no later than Monday, November 28, 2011.\u201d </em>IEU Preliminary Order \u00b6 18 (emphasis added). Any objection must also \u201cotherwise comply <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>with the requirements set forth in the [Detailed] Notice.\u201d IEU Preliminary Order \u00b6 18.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-5\">The \u201cDetailed Notice,\u201d attached as Exhibit A, set out further instructions. Potential objectors were told to \u201cmail [their] written objections], including proof of membership in the Settlement Class and a statement of the nature and grounds for your objection, to the Clerk of the Court,\u201d to be received and filed by a date to be determined.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> IEU Detailed Notice \u00b6\u00b6 7-8, ECF No. 1024-1. As eventually published, the Detailed Notice required that objections be received by the Court \u201cno later than November 28, 2011.\u201d <em>See </em>IEU Detailed Notice, <em>available at </em>http://www. chocolatesettlementindirect.com/ doeuments/EU-DetailedN otice.pdf (last visited Mar. 5, 2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b97-7\">Appellant Padgett, who objected in writing to the terms of the proposed Settlement, described himself as a \u201cpro se member of this class action lawsuit by being an indirect purchaser and consumer,\u201d although he enclosed no proof of his status. Padgett complained that the Settlement Agreement would not deter Cadbury from \u201ccontinuing] its deceptive trade practices,\u201d cited the \u201cproblematic\u201d nature of the \u201cexcessively broad release\u201d contained in the Settlement Agreement, and railed against the use of the \u201ccomplete settlement fund\u201d to pay attorneys\u2019 fees. <em>See </em>Objection 1-2, ECF No. 1084. Despite his putative membership in the IEU class, Padgett referred instead to monetary figures from the proposed Settlement Agreement for the <em>direct-purchaser </em>plaintiff class, <em>see </em>Direct-Purchaser Detailed Notice \u00b6 4, ECF No. 1023-1, and served his objection on the direct-purchaser attorneys instead of the IEU attorneys. <em>Compare </em>Objection 4, <em>and </em>Direct-Purchaser Detailed Notice \u00b6 6, <em>with </em>IEU Detailed Notice \u00b6 6. Padgett deposited his objection via Express Mail on November 23, 2011; delivery to the District Court was unsuccessfully attempted on November 26 (a Saturday) and November 28 (a Monday) before success on November 29. Counsel for the direct purchaser plaintiffs, whom Padgett had erroneously served, responded by requesting that his objection be overruled. <em>See </em>Response, ECF No. 1092.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-10\">On December 12, 2011, the District Court granted final approval of proposed class-action settlements with regard to three plaintiff subclasses, including the IEU class. <em>See </em>ECF Nos. 1105-07. While signed on December 12, the order relating to the IEU class \u2014 which did not reference or otherwise comment on Padgett\u2019s objections \u2014 was entered one day later on December 13. <em>See </em>ECF No. 1107 docket text. Padgett\u2019s notice of appeal, ECF No. 1133, was received by the District Court on January 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-11\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-12\">In its motion to dismiss, Cadbury first argues that Padgett\u2019s notice of appeal was filed more than thirty days after entry of judgment, depriving us of jurisdiction. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2107(a); Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(1)(A); <em>Bowles v. Russell, </em>551 U.S. 205, 214, 127 S.Ct. 2360, 168 L.Ed.2d 96 (2007). As noted above, however, judgment was entered as per the IEU plaintiffs on December <em>13, </em>not December 12. \u201c[Although an order may be signed by the district court, received by the clerk, and entered in the docket on different days, the entry date controls\u201d for the purposes of determining timeliness. <em>United States v. Fiorelli, </em>337 F.3d 282, 287 (3d Cir.2003); <em>see also </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 58(a). A notice of appeal is considered \u201cfiled\u201d when it is received by the clerk\u2019s office. <em>United States </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number><em>v. Solly, </em>545 F.2d 874, 876 (3d Cir.1976). Padgett\u2019s notice of appeal was received by the District Court on January 12, 2012, thirty days later; it was therefore timely filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-4\">Cadbury next argues that Padgett\u2019s objection to the proposed settlement was neither timely nor proper, depriving him of the ability to appeal. But the District Court did not rule on the propriety of Padgett\u2019s objection, and we are hesitant to deem its structural faults to be per se fatal to our exercise of appellate jurisdiction, especially given an apparent inconsistency in when objections were to be received by the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-5\">In sum, we are satisfied that we have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-7\">Cadbury\u2019s final argument is that Padgett\u2019s objection is meritless and should be dismissed. On this ground, we are in accord. The objection is wanting, its content derived from figures present in a settlement agreement that was simply not applicable to plaintiffs in Padgett\u2019s (the IEU) class. As Cadbury points out, Padgett also misreads several sections of the Settlement Agreement. For example, Cad-bury did not admit misconduct as part of the Settlement Agreement, and the Agreement hardly forestalled future legal action in \u201cevery possible scenario conceivable to man,\u201d as Padgett claimed. <em>See, e.g., </em>Settlement Agreement \u00b6 36(a) (delineating the claims released); <em>see also In re Prudential Ins. Co. of Am. Sales Practice Litig., </em>261 F.3d 355, 366 (3d Cir.2001) (\u201cIt is now settled that a judgment pursuant to a class settlement can bar later claims based on the allegations underlying the claims in the settled class action. This is true even though the precluded claim was not presented, and could not have been presented, in the class action itself.\u201d). Padgett\u2019s vague objections and attacks on the financial stability of class counsel do nothing to shed light on any inequity contained in the Agreement. We therefore cannot find that the District Court abused its discretion in approving the IEU Settlement Agreement. <em>See In re Ins. Brokerage Antitrust Litig., </em>579 F.3d 241, 256 (3d Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b98-9\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-10\">For these reasons, to the extent Cad-bury\u2019s motion requests dismissal of Padgett\u2019s appeal for lack of jurisdiction, the motion is denied. To the extent Cadbury\u2019s motion seeks dismissal for lack of merit, it is treated as a motion for summary affirmance, and so treated, is granted because the appeal presents no substantial question. <em>Murray v. Bledsoe, </em>650 F.3d 246, 247 (3d Cir.2011) (per curiam).</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b96-10\">.
