In his petition, Sheppard challenged his conviction out of the Eastern District of Missouri for conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute methamphetamine.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-32\">Sheppard asserts that the district court had jurisdiction over his petition because both he and his custodian, the warden of his prison facility, are within the Northern District of Texas. He contends that 28 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 is inadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his detention. Sheppard claims that the dismissal of his .\u00a7 2241 petition impermissibly suspends the writ of habeas corpus. In addition, Sheppard has briefed the merits of his claim that his drug conspiracy conviction was unconstitutional because the Controlled Substances Act violates the Tenth Amendment and exceeds the federal government\u2019s power under the Commerce Clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-5\">We review a district court\u2019s dismissal of a \u00a7 2241 petition de novo. <em>Kinder v. Purdy, </em>222 F.3d 209, 212 (5th Cir.2000). A \u00a7 2241 petition and a \u00a7 2255 motion \u201care distinct mechanisms for seeking post-conviction relief.\u201d <em>Pack v. Yusuff, </em>218 F.3d 448, 451 (5th Cir.2000). Section 2255 is the primary mechanism for collaterally attacking a federal sentence, and a \u00a7 2255 motion must be filed in the sentencing court. <em>Id. </em>By contrast, the proper procedural vehicle for challenging the manner in which a sentence is executed is \u00a7 2241, and a \u00a7 2241 petition must be filed in the district of incarceration. <em>Id. </em>\u201cA section 2241 petition that seeks to challenge the validity of a federal sentence must either be dismissed or construed as a section 2255 motion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 452.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-6\">As the claims raised by Sheppard in his \u00a7 2241 petition attacked the validity of his conviction and sentence, the district court did not err in its determination that the claims would be properly brought in a \u00a7 2255 motion. <em>See Pack, </em>218 F.3d at 451. As Sheppard was sentenced in a Missouri district court, the district court in Texas correctly determined that it lacked jurisdiction to consider his petition as a \u00a7 2255 motion. <em>See Ojo v. INS, </em>106 F.3d 680, 683 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b389-7\">A prisoner may attack the validity of his conviction in a \u00a7 2241 petition only if he can meet the requirements of the savings clause of \u00a7 2255(e). <em>Kinder, </em>222 F.3d at 212. The petitioner has the burden to show affirmatively that the remedy under \u00a7 2255 would be \u201cinadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his detention.\u201d <em>Reyes-Requena v. United States, </em>243 F.3d 893, 901 (5th Cir.2001). The petitioner must establish that his claim (1) \u201cis based on a retroactively applicable Supreme Court decision which establishes that the petitioner may have been convicted of a nonexistent offense\u201d and (2) \u201cwas foreclosed by circuit law at the time when the claim should have been raised in the petitioner\u2019s trial, appeal, or first \u00a7 2255 motion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 904. Sheppard has failed to make the required showing.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-9\">Sheppard\u2019s insistence that the dismissal of his \u00a7 2241 petition impermissibly suspends the writ of habeas corpus lacks merit. We have held that the restrictions on obtaining relief pursuant to \u00a7 2241 and the savings clause of \u00a7 2255 do not violate the Suspension Clause. <em>See Wesson v. United States Penitentiary Beaumont, TX, </em>305 F.3d 343, 347 (5th Cir.2002); <em>Reyes-Requena, </em>243 F.3d at 901 n. 19.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b388-33\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
