We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for abuse of discretion the denial of a continuance and the denial of a motion to remand. <em>Sandoval-Luna v. Mukasey, </em>526 F.3d 1243, 1246 (9th Cir.2008) (per curiam); <em>Romero-Ruiz v. Mukasey, </em>538 F.3d 1057, 1062 (9th Cir.2008). We deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-24\">The IJ did not abuse his discretion by denying a continuance to allow Rodriguez-Gudino to seek post-conviction relief where Rodriguez-Gudino failed to submit any evidence to the IJ that he was pursuing such relief. <em>See Sandoval-Luna, </em>526 F.3d at 1247 (an IJ may grant a continuance for good cause shown). Further, because the denial of the continuance was not error, the denial did not violate Rodriguez-Gudino\u2019s due process rights. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number><em>See Lata v. INS, </em>204 F.3d 1241, 1246 (9th Cir.2000) (\u201cTo prevail on a due process challenge to deportation proceedings, [a petitioner] must show error and substantial prejudice.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b591-5\">The BIA did not abuse its discretion by denying Rodriguez-Gudino\u2019s motion to remand where the BIA considered the evidence submitted and acted within, its broad discretion in determining that the evidence was insufficient to warrant remanding. <em>See Romero-Ruiz, </em>538 F.3d at 1062 (BIA abuses its discretion if its denial of a motion to remand is \u201carbitrary, irrational, or contrary to law\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b591-6\">Rodriguez-Gudino\u2019s remaining contentions are unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-7\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b590-17\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
