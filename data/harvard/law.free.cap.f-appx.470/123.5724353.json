The district court imposed the statutory maximum sentence of 120 months\u2019 imprisonment. On appeal, Meyer argues that: (1) his trial counsel was constitutionally ineffective; (2) the appellate waiver in his plea agreement is unenforceable; and (3) the district court abused its discretion by imposing an unreasonable sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-23\">The Government seeks to enforce the appellate waiver provision of the plea agreement and has moved to dismiss Meyer\u2019s appeal. In response, Meyer asserts that the appellate waiver does not preclude claims of ineffective assistance of counsel, the Government waived assertion of the waiver by failing to object when the district court instructed Meyer that he had a right to appeal after imposing his sentence, and Meyer did not knowingly and voluntarily waive his right to appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>A defendant may, in a valid plea agreement, waive the right to appeal under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742 (2006). <em>United States v. Wiggins, </em>905 F.2d 51, 53 (4th Cir.1990). An appellate waiver must be \u201cthe result of a knowing and intelligent decision to forgo the right to appeal.\u201d <em>United States v. Broughton-Jones, </em>71 F.3d 1143, 1146 (4th Cir.1995) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). We review de novo whether a defendant has effectively waived his right to appeal. <em>United States v. Marin, </em>961 F.2d 493, 496 (4th Cir.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b152-4\">To determine whether a waiver is knowing and intelligent, this court examines \u201cthe totality of the circumstances, including the experience and conduct of the accused, as well as the accused\u2019s educational background and familiarity with the terms of the plea agreement.\u201d <em>United States v. General, </em>278 F.3d 389, 400 (4th Cir.2002) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Generally, if a court fully questions a defendant regarding the waiver of his right to appeal during the Rule 11 colloquy, the waiver is both valid and enforceable. <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>410 F.3d 137, 151 (4th Cir.2005). However, this court will \u201crefuse to enforce an otherwise valid waiver if to do so would result in a miscarriage of justice.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b152-5\">Although the district court mistakenly told Meyer \u201cYou do have the right to appeal\u201d after imposing his sentence, this statement does not nullify the valid waiver contained in his plea agreement. The court specifically questioned Meyer regarding the waiver provision numerous times during the Fed.R.Crim.P. 11 plea colloquy. Meyer, a fifty-seven-year-old man with a bachelor\u2019s degree, indicated that he had reviewed the appellate waiver with his attorney, understood it, and did not have any questions. Thereafter, the court permitted Meyer\u2019s counsel additional time to discuss the waiver provision with his client, and questioned whether Meyer understood the waiver provision a second time. Meyer responded that he understood. We therefore conclude that Meyer knowingly and intelligently waived his right to appeal his sentence. Accordingly, Meyer\u2019s challenge to his sentence falls within the scope of the waiver and may not be reviewed by this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-7\">Meyer also asserts that his trial counsel provided ineffective assistance by failing to ascertain his relevant conduct, failing to explain the effect his relevant conduct would have on his Guidelines range, and failing to preserve his right to appeal his sentence. Claims of ineffective assistance of counsel fall outside the scope of the appellate waiver provision, and we deny the motion to dismiss as to these claims. However, as a general rule, claims of ineffective assistance of counsel should be raised in a 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2255 (West Supp. 2010) motion rather than on direct appeal, unless the appellate record conclusively demonstrates ineffective assistance. <em>United States v. Benton, </em>523 F.3d 424, 435 (4th Cir.2008). Because the record here does not establish that counsel was constitutionally ineffective, these claims are not subject to review on direct appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-8\">Accordingly, we grant the Government\u2019s motion to dismiss in part and deny it in part. We dismiss the appeal of Meyer\u2019s sentence and otherwise affirm the judgment of the district court. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-9\">\n<em>AFFIRMED IN PART; DISMISSED IN PART.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
