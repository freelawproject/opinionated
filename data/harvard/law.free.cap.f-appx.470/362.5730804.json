Birl contends that his liberty and property interests were implicated by the denial of procedural due process related to the disciplinary investigation and charge. His disciplinary conviction resulted in punish- \u25a0 ment of the loss of 45 days of commissary privileges, 45 days of cell restriction, a . reduction in line class from S3 to LI, and the loss of 30 days of good-time credit. Birl claimed that these sanctions constituted unlawful deprivations of liberty. Birl also alleged that in the course of the disciplinary investigation, prison officials confiscated commissary products from his unit, only some of which have been returned to him, and placed a hold, yet to be lifted, on his inmate trust account that prevents him from making commissary purchases. Birl alleges that the confiscation of his commissary products and the placement of an indefinite hold on his commissary account deprived him of protected property interests without due process of law. The district court dismissed Birl\u2019s habeas petition and Birl petitioned this court for a certificate of appealability (COA). <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c). A judge of this court denied COA with respect to Birl\u2019s liberty interest claims but granted Birl a COA on the issue of whether his property interest claims are cognizable under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-13\">Prisoners claims alleging deprivations of property interest without due process of law are plainly cognizable under \u00a7 1983. <em>See, e.g., McCrae v. Hankins, </em>720 F.2d 863, 869 (5th Cir.1983), <em>abrogated on other grounds by Hudson v. Palmer, </em>468 U.S. 517, 531-33, 104 S.Ct. 3194, 82 L.Ed.2d 393 (1984), <em>as recognized in Augustine v. Doe, </em>740 F.2d 322, 328 &amp; n. 10 (5th Cir.1984) (explaining that where prisoners are permitted to possess property, they have a protected interest in their property and \u00a7 1983 provides a remedy if prison officials deprive prisoners of this interest absent due process). We have held that, \u201cin instances in which a petition combines claims that should be asserted in habeas with claims that properly may be pursued as an initial matter under \u00a7 1983, and the claims can be separated, federal courts should do so, entertaining the \u00a7 1983 claims.\u201d <em>Serio v. Members of La. St. Bd. of Pardons, </em>821 F.2d 1112, 1119 (5th Cir.1987); <em>accord Orellana v. Kyle, </em>65 F.3d 29, 31 (5th Cir.1995) (stating that, in such instances, \u201cthe district court should separate the claims and decide the \u00a7 1983 claims\u201d (citing <em>Serio, </em>821 F.2d at 1119)).</p>\n<p id=\"b391-14\">Therefore, it is proper for the district court to consider in the first instance whether Birl\u2019s property interest claims may proceed under \u00a7 1983, subject to the requirements of the Prison Litigation Reform Act of 1995, which \u201cdo not apply to habeas petitions under \u00a7 2254.\u201d <em>Carson v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number><em>Johnson, </em>112 F.3d 818, 820 (5th Cir.1997). If the district court reaches the merits of Birl\u2019s claims, it will be proper for that court to determine whether those claims implicate deprivations of protected property interests and, if so, whether the procedural due process requirements of <em>Wolff v. McDonnell, </em>418 U.S. 539, 564-66, 94 S.Ct. 2963, 41 L.Ed.2d 935 (1974), were satisfied.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-4\">We therefore VACATE the district court\u2019s judgment and REMAND for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b391-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
