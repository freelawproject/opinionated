We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review de novo. <em>Cramer v. Consol. Freightways, Inc., </em>255 F.3d 683, 689 (9th Cir.2001) (en banc) (preemption); <em>Galindo v. Stoody Co., </em>793 F.2d 1502, 1508 (9th Cir.1986) (statute of limitations). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-4\">The district court properly concluded that Leistiko\u2019s claim that he was wrongfully de-registered from the union was preempted by \u00a7 301 of the Labor Management Relations Act (\u201cLMRA\u201d) because resolution of his claim would require interpreting labor agreements. <em>See Cramer, 255 F.3d </em>at 693 (state law claim preempted under \u00a7 301 if it would require interpreting a labor agreement).</p>\n<p id=\"b720-5\">The district court properly concluded that Leistiko\u2019s claim, as preempted by \u00a7 301, was barred by the six-month statute of limitations. <em>See Conley v. Int'l Bhd. of Elec. Workers, Local 639, </em>810 F.2d 913, 914-15 (9th Cir.1987) (plaintiffs complaint alleging violations of \u00a7 301 of the LMRA and state contract law was subject to the National Labor Relations Act\u2019s six-month statute of limitations because essence of plaintiffs complaint was that the union failed to act fairly on his behalf); <em>Galindo, </em>793 F.2d at 1509 (limitations period begins to run when plaintiff knows or should have known of the union\u2019s alleged wrongdoing).</p>\n<p id=\"b720-6\">The district court properly denied Leistiko\u2019s motion to remand to state court because the ILWU timely removed the action. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1446(b) (notice of removal must be filed within thirty days after the defendant\u2019s receipt of the complaint); <em>D-Beam Ltd. P\u2019ship v. Roller Derby Skates, Inc., </em>366 F.3d 972, 974 n. <em>2 </em>(9th Cir.2004) (applying de novo review to denial of motion to remand).</p>\n<p id=\"b720-10\">Leistiko\u2019s remaining contentions are unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b719-28\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provid<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"692\">*692</page-number>ed by 9th Cir.
