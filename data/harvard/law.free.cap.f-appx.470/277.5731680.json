In a thorough and careful memorandum opinion, the district court dismissed all claims as lacking merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-8\">DeSmit, <em>pro $e </em>as in the district court, appeals but does not explain how, in his view, the district court erred. The failure to brief is fatal to any claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-9\">\u201cBecause [the plaintiff] has failed to brief any issue, his appeal is frivolous and is dismissed. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2.\u201d <em>Hawkins v. Woods, </em>463 Fed.Appx. 337, 338 (5th Cir.2012) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b306-10\">This appeal, likewise, is frivolous and subject to dismissal under Rule 42.2. Even if we were to consider the correctness of the judgment, we would affirm on the basis of the district court\u2019s convincing discussion of the issues raised in that court.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-11\">The appeal is DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b306-14\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
