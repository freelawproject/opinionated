LUCERO, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b746-27\">Joshua Phares, a state prisoner proceeding pro se, seeks to appeal from a district court order denying his petition for a writ of habeas corpus. We deny a certif\u00edcate of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"719\">*719</page-number>appealability (\u201cCOA\u201d) and dismiss this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b747-6\">Phares was sentenced to life imprisonment on January 30, 2009. Because he did not file a direct appeal, his sentence became final on February 9, 2009. <em>See Clark v. Oklahoma, </em>468 F.3d 711, 713 (10th Cir.2006); Okla. Stat. tit. 22, Ch. 18, App., R. 2.5(A). Phares did not submit the instant petition seeking federal habeas relief, however, until December 14, 2011. Concluding that Phares\u2019 petition was filed out of time, the district court denied relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b747-8\">We may issue a COA \u201conly if the applicant has made a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2). The petitioner must show \u201cthat reasonable jurists could debate whether (or, for that matter, agree that) the petition should have been resolved in a different manner or that the issues presented were adequate to deserve encouragement to proceed further.\u201d <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000) (quotation omitted). \u201cWhere a plain procedural bar is present and the district court is correct to invoke it to dispose of the case, a reasonable jurist could not conclude either that the.district court erred in dismissing the petition or that the petitioner should be allowed to proceed further.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b747-9\">Because Phares filed his habeas petition well after the limitations period expired on February 10, 2010, it is untimely. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(1)(A) (imposing a one-year limitations period that begins to run on \u201cthe date on which the judgment became final by the conclusion of direct review or the expiration of the time for seeking such review\u201d). Nevertheless, he may be eligible for equitable tolling if he demonstrates that \u201che has been pursuing his rights diligently,\u201d and that \u201csome extraordinary circumstance stood in the way\u201d of a timely filing. <em>Pace v. DiGuglielmo, </em>544 U.S. 408, 418, 125 S.Ct. 1807, 161 L.Ed.2d 669 (2005). Upon examining the record, we agree with the district court that Phares has not met his burden to qualify for this \u201crare remedy.\u201d <em>Wallace v. Kato, </em>549 U.S. 384, 396, 127 S.Ct. 1091, 166 L.Ed.2d 973 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b747-12\">Phares provides the following explanations for his delay: He experienced a head injury in July 2009, was confined in administrative segregation between August and December 2009, and the correctional facility in which he was housed was on lock-down from December 2009 until March 2010. However, Phares\u2019 medical records indicate that any mental incapacitation from his injury persisted for less than a</p>\n<p id=\"A3q\">day. The mere fact of a prison lockdown, moreover, does not qualify as extraordinary absent some additional showing that the circumstances prevented him from timely filing his habeas petition. <em>See, e.g., Dill v. Workman, </em>288 Fed.Appx. 454, 457 (10th Cir.2008) (unpublished); <em>Parker v. Jones, </em>260 Fed.Appx. 81, 85 (10th Cir.2008) (unpublished); <em>Gifford v. Everett, </em>28 Fed.Appx. 748, 751 (10th Cir.2001) (unpublished). Likewise, we consider a prisoner\u2019s confinement in administrative segregation to be an extraordinary circumstance \u201conly where the prisoner has shown that despite his segregated confinement he diligently pursued his habeas claims and his confinement prevented him from filing on time.\u201d <em>See Green v. Kansas, </em>190 Fed.Appx. 682, 685 (10th Cir.2006) (unpublished).</p>\n<p id=\"b747-13\">Phares has offered no evidence or allegation <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> that he took action on his petition <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"720\">*720</page-number>during the six months between August 2009 and the running of his limitations period in February 2010. Furthermore, Phares has not provided any explanation for the approximately twenty-month delay that occurred after the lockdown was lifted.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-6\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b748-7\">We DENY COA and DISMISS this appeal. We GRANT Phares\u2019 motion to proceed in forma pauperis.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b746-8\"> This order is \u25a0 not binding precedent except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed. R.App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b747-10\">. Phares requested assistance from the Clerk of the United States District Court, Western <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"720\">*720</page-number>District of Oklahoma in July 2009, and claims to have asked a prison attorney for help via a \"Request to Staff\u201d submitted at some unspecified time.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
