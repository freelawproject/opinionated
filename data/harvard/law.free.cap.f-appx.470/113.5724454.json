Tobey asks us to overturn the court\u2019s order and conclude that he was \u201creleased from imprisonment,\u201d <em>see </em>18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3624(e) (West Supp.2011), thereby commencing his supervised release term, at the end of his original prison sentence but before his release from Bureau of Prisons custody pending a civil commitment hearing pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4248(a) (2006). After filing this appeal, however, Tobey and the Government entered into a settlement agreement whereby Tobey stipulated that his \u201crelease from imprisonment\u201d was lawfully stayed pursuant to \u00a7 4248.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> We conclude this stipulation eliminated the grounds for Tobey\u2019s appeal and removed any justiciable controversy between the parties. Accordingly, we dismiss Tobey\u2019s appeal as moot. <em>See Townes v. Jarvis, </em>577 F.3d 543, 546-47 (4th Cir.2009). We deny Tobey\u2019s motion for appointment of counsel. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-22\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b141-19\"> In the interest of justice, we take judicial notice of the district court proceedings in the Eastern District of North Carolina, including the settlement agreement, as they have direct bearing on the subject matter of this case. <em>United States v.
