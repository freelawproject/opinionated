We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-15\">Substantial evidence supports the Board\u2019s denial of asylum and withholding of removal because Vega-Aredo failed to show his alleged persecutors threatened him on account of a protected ground. His fear of future persecution based on an actual or imputed anti-gang or anti-crime opinion is not on account of the protected ground of either membership in a particular social group or political opinion. <em>Ramos Barrios v. Holder, </em>581 F.3d 849, 854-56 (9th Cir.2009); <em>Santos-Lemus v. Mukasey, </em>542 F.3d 738, 745-46 (9th Cir.2008); <em>see Ochave v. INS, </em>254 F.3d 859, 865 (9th Cir.2001) (\u201cAsylum generally is not available to victims of civil strife, unless they are singled out on account of a protected ground.\u201d) Contrary to Vega-Aredo\u2019s assertions, the Board upheld the IJ\u2019s factual findings, and the record does not compel the conclusion that Vega-Aredo established he was persecuted on account of an anti-gang political opinion when he resisted the gang\u2019s third recruitment attempt.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-16\">Substantial evidence also supports the Board\u2019s denial of CAT relief based on the Board\u2019s finding that Vega-Arego did not establish a likelihood of torture by, at the instigation of, or with the consent or acquiescence of the Peruvian government. <em>See Arteaga v. Mukasey, </em>511 F.3d 940, 948-49 (9th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b584-17\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b584-13\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
