Plaintiff Greer Coalition is an organization of citizens who live in or own property in Greer, Arizona. Plaintiff Center for Biological Diversity is a non-profit conservation organization. In this latest round of litigation, Plaintiffs appeal the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment to the Forest Service. Plaintiffs argue that the Forest Service violated the National Environmental Policy Act Of 1969 (\u201cNEPA\u201d) and the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 (\u201cFLPMA\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b660-15\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-16\">This court reviews the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment <em>de novo. Klamath Siskiyou Wildlands Ctr. v. Boody, </em>468 F.3d 549, 554 (9th Cir.2006). \u201cAgency decisions that allegedly violate NEPA and FLPMA ... may be set aside if they are \u2018arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(2)(A)). An agency decision is arbitrary and capricious if it \u201crelied on factors Congress did not intend it to consider, entirely failed to consider an important aspect of the problem, or offered an explanation that runs counter to the evidence before the agency or is so implausible that it could not be ascribed to a difference in view or the product of agency expertise.\u201d <em>Lands Council v. McNair, </em>537 F.3d 981, 987 (9th Cir.2008) (en banc), <em>overruled on other grounds by Winter v. Natural Res. Def. Council, Inc., </em>555 U.S. 7, 129 S.Ct. 365, 172 L.Ed.2d 249 (2008) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b661-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number>II.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-5\">Plaintiffs bring two types of challenges under NEPA. \u201cNEPA does not require us to decide whether an EIS is based on the best scientific methodology available.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1003 (internal quotation marks and brackets omitted). \u201c[N]or does NEPA require us to resolve disagreements among various scientists as to methodology.\u201d <em>Friends of Endangered Species, Inc., v. Jantzen, </em>760 F.2d 976, 986 (9th Cir.1985); <em>see also Marsh v. Or. Natural Res. Council, </em>490 U.S. 360, 378, 109 S.Ct. 1851, 104 L.Ed.2d 377 (1989). Instead, \u201c[o]ur task is simply to ensure that the procedure followed by the Service resulted in a reasoned analysis of the evidence before it.\u201d <em>Friends of Endangered Species, </em>760 F.2d at 986.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-6\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-7\">The Forest Service circulated a draft Environmental Impact Statement (\u201cEIS\u201d) for comment. Commenters criticized the Geologic Resources Report for lacking data. In response, the Forest Service prepared an Amendment to the Geologic Resources Report (\u201cAmendment\u201d), which develops a model for the impact of \u201cwildcat development\u201d based on two slug tests performed on site. Plaintiffs argue that the Forest Service should have released the Amendment for public comment.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-8\">An agency may \u201c[s]upplement, improve, or modify its analyses\u201d in response to comments, 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 1503.4(a)(3), and \u201c[i]f a draft statement is so inadequate as to preclude meaningful analysis, the agency shall prepare and circulate a revised draft of the appropriate portion,\u201d <em>id. </em>\u00a7 1502.9(a). Plaintiffs do not make any showing that the draft EIS was so inadequate as to preclude meaningful analysis. Therefore, the Forest Service was not required to circulate a revised draft for comments.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-9\">Instead, Plaintiffs argue that the Forest Service should have prepared a supplement. \u201cCourts must uphold an agency determination that a supplemental EIS is not required if that determination is not arbitrary and capricious.\u201d <em>Or. Natural Res. Council v. Lyng, </em>882 F.2d 1417, 1422 (9th Cir.1989). Agencies must \u201cprepare supplements to either draft or final environmental impact statements if ... [t]here are significant new circumstances or information relevant to environmental concerns and bearing on the proposed action or its impacts.\u201d 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 1502.9(c)(1). If the agency prepares a supplement, it must seek comments. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1502.9(c)(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b661-10\">The Forest Service\u2019s decision not to formally supplement its EIS was not arbitrary and capricious because the Amendment is neither a significant new circumstance nor does it provide significant new information. The supplement requirement is triggered by \u201cnew circumstances\u201d when the underlying <em>project </em>significantly changes. <em>See, e.g., Klamath Siskiyou Wildlands Ctr., </em>468 F.3d at 561 (decision that substantially changed resource management plan requires supplemental EIS); <em>N. Idaho Cmty. Action Network v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Transp., </em>545 F.3d 1147, 1152, 1157 (9th Cir.2008) (per curiam) (changes to highway proposal in response to comments too minor to require supplement). The Amendment did not relate to a change in the proposed exchange.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-11\">Significant \u201cnew information\u201d typically involves intervening information. <em>See, e.g., Native Ecosystems Council v. Tidwell, </em>599 F.3d 926, 935, 937-38 (9th Cir.2010) (revelation of 1900 acres of nesting habitat in project area, discovered after Forest Service\u2019s Environmental Assessment stated that there were no known nesting grounds in area, triggered supplemental environmental assessment); <em>Ober v. EPA, </em>84 F.3d 304, 314 (9th Cir.1996) (documents sent by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"634\">*634</page-number>state agency after close of comment period were new information because they \u201cdid not merely expand on prior information and address alleged deficiencies,\u201d were \u201crelied on and were critical to the EPA\u2019s approval\u201d and were of questionable accuracy). The Amendment provides analysis conducted pursuant to comments on a draft EIS and confirms information already in the record. It does not provide new information under this standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-4\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-5\">Plaintiffs take issue with the Forest Service\u2019s procedure for testing hydraulic conductivity. First, Plaintiffs argue that the Forest Service should have used a different type of test that would, they argue, provide more accurate information. Second, Plaintiffs object to the testing sites that the Forest Service chose because, they argue, the tested locations are unrepresentative. Third, Plaintiffs object to the Forest Service\u2019s decision to average the two disparate measures of hydraulic conductivity produced by their tests. Plaintiffs fail to show that any of these choices was unreasonable. This court must decline Plaintiffs\u2019 invitation to \u201cresolve disagreements among various scientists as to methodology.\u201d <em>Friends of Endangered Species, </em>760 F.2d at 986.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-6\">Plaintiffs also argue that the Amendment fails to consider the cumulative impact of reasonably foreseeable development. An EIS must analyze \u201cthe impact on the environment which results from the incremental impact of the action when added to other past, present, and reasonably foreseeable future actions.\u201d 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 1508.7. The Amendment does not consider current conditions, but the final EIS considers the Amendment along with a different study that evaluates the present state of local groundwater. Therefore, the Forest Service did consider cumulative effects.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-8\">In its Amendment, the Forest Service analyzes the effect of a hypothetical \u201cwildcat development\u201d on surface water flow. This analysis assumes that fifty percent of the amount of the water pumped from wells in the hypothetical development would be recharged to the water table through septic tank effluent. Plaintiffs argue that residents in this development would be required to connect to a sanitation district and therefore septic recharge would not occur.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-9\">The harmless error doctrine applies \u201cwhen a mistake of the administrative body is one that <em>clearly </em>had <em>no bearing </em>on the procedure used or the substance of [the] decision reached.\u201d <em>Natural Res. Def. Council v. U.S. Forest Serv., </em>421 F.3d 797, 807 (9th Cir.2005) (internal quotation marks omitted). Even if the Forest Service\u2019s septic recharge assumption was erroneous, the error was harmless because the Forest Service\u2019s other estimates were conservative by more than a factor of two. For example, the Forest Service\u2019s hypothetical development assumed immediate installation of 258 wells, even though the Forest Service estimates that no more than 35 wells would be installed over the next 15 years. This estimate, conservative by a factor of over seven, renders the Forest Service\u2019s alleged factor-of-two error harmless. If the Forest Service had not assumed septic recharge, but had assumed a less conservative but still reasonable number of wells in its model, it would have reached the same conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-10\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-11\">Plaintiffs bring two types of challenges under FLPMA. Plaintiffs fail to show that any of the challenged choices were a \u201cclear error of judgment,\u201d <em>Mt. St. Helens Mining &amp; Recovery Ltd. P\u2019ship v. United States, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number>384 F.3d 721, 728 (9th Cir.2004), or that the Forest Service \u201centirely failed to conr sider an important aspect of the problem,\u201d <em>Lands Council, </em>537 F.3d at 987. Accordingly, both challenges fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-5\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-6\">FLPMA authorizes a land exchange if the agency determines that the \u201cpublic interest will be well served by making that exchange.\u201d 43 U.S.C. \u00a7 1716(a). The Forest Supervisor determined that the proposed exchange is in the public interest. Plaintiffs challenge two aspects of this determination, each of which fails. Plaintiffs argue that the Forest Service ignored the benefits of <em>&amp;\u25a0 </em>\u201cno action\u201d scenario in its decisionmaking. Specifically, they point out that the Record of Decision does not acknowledge the loss of plants or wildlife on the Greer Parcels. However, the Record of Decision relies on the final EIS, which concludes that \u201c[t]he proposed action would result in no negative effect on [threatened, endangered, or sensitive] plant and animal species and their habitat.\u201d Therefore, the Record of Decision does not fail to list the benefits of retaining the Greer Parcels to threatened, endangered, or sensitive plant and wildlife. This is consistent with the Forest Service\u2019s listed benefit of the proposed exchange, which discusses only riparian and vital species habitat on the Owens Parcels, rather than all plants and wildlife that would be gained in the exchange.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-7\">Plaintiffs also argue that the Record of Decision should mention that the land available for recreational opportunities on the Owens Parcels is seasonally unavailable and distant from Greer. Plaintiffs do not cite any evidence indicating that the allegedly omitted information is true. Nor do they cite any support for their assertion that a failure to consider seasonal unavailability and distance from a specific town is an \u201cimportant aspect of the problem,\u201d such that a failure to consider it is arbitrary and capricious. <em>Lands Council, </em>537 F.3d at 987.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-9\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-10\">The land to be exchanged must be appraised, 43 U.S.C. \u00a7 1716(b), in accordance with the Department of Justice\u2019s Uniform Appraisal Standards for Federal Land Acquisitions (\u201cUASFLA\u201d), 36 C.F.R. \u00a7 254.9. Plaintiffs challenge three types of choices made in the appraisals.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-11\">1. Plaintiffs challenge the Greer Parcel appraisal\u2019s choice of comparables. First, Plaintiffs argue that the appraisal\u2019s failure to include two Greer sales results in undervaluing the Greer parcels. The UASFLA establishes that \u201ctransactions in lands in the vicinity of and comparable to the land under appraisement, reasonably near the time of acquisition, are the best evidence of market value.\u201d UASFLA \u00a7 B-4. The appraiser established that she could not find comparable sales in Greer, and instead used location-adjusted sales in other towns to value the Greer Parcels. These comparables may not be the \u201cbest evidence\u201d to which the UASFLA aspires, but Plaintiffs have not shown that the appraisal showed a clear error in judgment by excluding the two Greer sales.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-12\">Plaintiffs also argue that the appraisal fails to consider the 2003 sale of 8.16 acres immediately adjacent to one of the Greer Parcels, or to list it as excluded from the appraisal. The appraisal of the Greer Parcels explains that it does not consider any comparables that were sold before May 2005 because \u201cthere are a sufficient number of sales since 2005 to provide an adequate analysis of the current market value, eliminating the need to rely on the older sales.\u201d This is consistent with the UASFLA\u2019s recommendation that comparables <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"636\">*636</page-number>considered should be \u201creasonably near the time of acquisition.\u201d UASFLA \u00a7 B-4 (citing, <em>inter alia, United States v. 100 Acres of Land, </em>468 F.2d 1261, 1265 (9th Cir.1972)). And even if the appraisal should have included this sale, Plaintiffs have not shown that they were prejudiced by the omission because they do not explain how the appraiser\u2019s weighted average of comparable sales would have changed. <em>See Del Norte Cnty. v. United States, </em>732 F.2d 1462, 1467 (9th Cir.1984) (\u201c[Unsubstantial errors in an administrative proceeding that prejudice no one do not require administrative decisions to be set aside.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b664-4\">2. Second, Plaintiffs challenge the appraisal\u2019s location adjustment, arguing that the adjustment causes the appraisal to undervalue Greer properties and overvalue properties in Show Low, a different town, that were also considered. Plaintiffs argue that the location adjustment compares high-end Show Low properties to average Greer properties. Plaintiffs do not cite any evidence to support their assertion that the two sets of properties are unrepresentative of the two locations. Plaintiffs also argue that the exclusion of one Greer lot for being too \u201chigh end\u201d is unfair because the comparison considers several lots in Show Low with substantial amenities. The appraisal finds that the excluded Greer sale is an unrepresentative outlier, while the Show Low homes, representing over half of the sales in Show Low, are representative of sales in Show Low. Again, Plaintiffs fail to show a clear error in judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-5\">3. Plaintiffs also challenge the Greer Parcels appraisal\u2019s historical adjustment. Each appraisal adjusts historical sales to analyze the sales as though they occurred in the financial environment that prevailed on September 19, 2008. Each appraisal sets a shelf life of one year, consistent with the UASFLA. <em>See </em>UASFLA \u00a7 D-13.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-7\">Plaintiffs argue that the Greer Parcels appraisal relies on prices set at April 2006 levels that should have been updated to account for the downturn experienced by September 2008. But because the Greer Parcels appraisal concluded that unimproved land prices had been flat since 2006, no adjustment from 2006 to 2008 was necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-8\">Second, Plaintiffs argue that the appraisals should have been updated between September 2008, when the appraisals were prepared, and September 2009, when the exchange was executed, because of the extraordinary market conditions in that year. In essence they argue that because the economic crisis was unprecedented, the one-year shelf life expected in September 2008 was, in retrospect, too long. But Plaintiffs have not put forward any evidence that the national recession affected the <em>relative </em>value of the Greer and Owens Parcels. This matters because an exchange is concerned with the relative value of two sets of property rather than the absolute value of either. <em>See </em>43 U.S.C. \u00a7 1716(b); <em>cf. Desert Citizens Against Pollution v. Bisson, </em>231 F.3d 1172, 1185 (9th Cir.2000) (BLM guidelines required update to land exchange appraisal because \u201csignificant local events,\u201d affecting one of the properties to be exchanged, occurred). Therefore, Plaintiffs fail to show that the Forest Service\u2019s decision not to update the appraisals was arbitrary and capricious.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-9\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-10\">Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is</p>\n<p id=\"b664-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b660-17\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9 th Cir.
