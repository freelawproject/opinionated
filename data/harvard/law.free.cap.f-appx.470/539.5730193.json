The district court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> imposed a sentence of 33 months in prison and 3 years of supervised release, and ordered her to pay $305,249.72 in restitution. Defense counsel has moved to withdraw and submitted a brief under <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b568-9\">We conclude that the appeal waiver should be enforced as to all issues in this appeal. <em>See United States v. Andis, </em>333 F.3d 886, 889-92 (8th Cir.2003) (en banc) (court should enforce appeal waiver and dismiss appeal where appeal falls within scope of waiver, both plea agreement and waiver were entered into knowingly and voluntarily, and no miscarriage of justice would result); <em>see also United States v. Estrada-Bahena, </em>201 F.3d 1070, 1071 (8th Cir.2000) (per curiam) (enforcing appeal waiver in <em>Anders </em>case).</p>\n<p id=\"b568-13\">Having independently reviewed the record under <em>Penson v. Ohio, </em>488 U.S. 75, 109 S.Ct. 346, 102 L.Ed.2d 300 (1988), we have found no nonfrivolous issue not covered by the waiver. Accordingly, we dismiss this appeal and grant counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw, subject to counsel informing Ms. Erickson about procedures for seeking rehearing or filing a petition for certiorari.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b568-10\">. The Honorable Gary A. Fenner, United States District Judge for the Western District of Missouri.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
