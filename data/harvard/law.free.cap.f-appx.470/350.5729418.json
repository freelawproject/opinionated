Mendez contends his guilty plea was not knowingly and voluntarily entered because he was not aware that his offense level for the advisory Sentencing Guidelines would be increased based on: his creating a risk of serious injury (to border patrol agents who apprehended Mendez and his group of illegal aliens); and his causing a serious injury (for raping a member of the alien group). He also contends his sentence was unreasonable because of these upward adjustments. The Government counters that Mendez\u2019 appeal is barred because, in his plea agreement, he waived the right to appeal his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-6\">The plain language of Mendez\u2019 plea agreement confirms that he waived the right to pursue this appeal, and our review of the rearraignment proceedings confirms that the waiver was knowing and voluntary. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Bond, </em>414 F.3d 542, 544 (5th Cir.2005) (two-step inquiry for waiver of appeal).</p>\n<p id=\"b379-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b378-37\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
