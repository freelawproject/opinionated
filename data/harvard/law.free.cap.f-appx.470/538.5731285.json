Farrey v. Sanderfoot, </em>500 U.S. 291, 301, 111 S.Ct. 1825, 114 L.Ed.2d 337 (1991) (holding that \u00a7 522(f)(1) \u201crequires a debtor to have possessed an interest to which a lien attached, before it attached, to avoid the fixing of the lien on that interest\u201d). Accordingly, we affirm the decision of the BAP. <em>See </em>8th Cir. R. 47B.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
