He was sentenced to 180 months in prison. In accordance with <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), Wakefield\u2019s attorney has filed a brief certifying that there are no meritorious issues for appeal, but questioning whether the district court complied with Fed.R.Crim.P. 11 in accepting Wakefield\u2019s guilty plea. Although informed of his right to do so, Wakefield has not filed a pro se supplemental brief. The Government has declined to file a responsive brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-10\">Prior to accepting a guilty plea, the district court must inform the defendant of the charges to which the plea is offered, any mandatory minimum penalty, the maximum possible penalty, and the various rights relinquished with the plea. Fed. R.Crim.P. 11(b). The court must also determine that the plea is voluntary and that there is a factual basis for the plea. <em>United States v. DeFusco, </em>949 F.2d 114, 119-20 (4th Cir.1991). A review of the record reveals that the district court complied with Rule ll\u2019s requirements, ensuring that Wakefield\u2019s guilty plea was knowing and voluntary and supported by a sufficient factual basis. Accordingly, we discern no error in the district court\u2019s acceptance of Wakefield\u2019s guilty plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-11\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have examined the record for potentially meritorious issues and have found none. We affirm the judgment of the district court. This court requires that counsel inform Wakefield, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If Wakefield requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on Wakefield. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-12\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
