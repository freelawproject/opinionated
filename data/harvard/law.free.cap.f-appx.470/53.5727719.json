Elstein denying his application for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d). <em>In re Mamadou Lamine Diallo, </em>No. A094 778 648 (B.I.A. July 6, 2011), <em>affg </em>No. A094 778 648 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City May 18, 2009). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-16\">We have reviewed the IJ\u2019s decision as supplemented by the BIA. <em>See Yan Chen v. Gonzales, </em>417 F.3d 268, 271 (2d Cir. 2005). The applicable standards of review are well-established. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>Yanqin Weng v. Holder, </em>562 F.3d 510, 513 (2d Cir.2009). For asylum applications governed by the REAL ID Act, such as Diallo\u2019s, the agency may, considering the totality of the circumstances, base a credibility finding on an applicant\u2019s demeanor, the plausibility of his account, or inconsistencies in his statements, without regard to whether they go \u201cto the heart of the applicant\u2019s claim.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(l)(B)(iii).</p>\n<p id=\"b81-17\">The agency finding that Diallo was not credible rested in part on the fact that a letter he submitted from his friend Mr. Bobo did not include details of his role in helping Diallo to escape from prison. Generally, the agency may rely on omissions as the basis for an adverse credibility determination. <em>See Xiu Xia Lin v. Mukasey, </em>534 F.3d 162, 166 n. 3 (2d Cir.2008). Diallo challenges the agency\u2019s assumption that the letter should have mentioned Mr. Bobo\u2019s past assistance; as Diallo observes, the letter was personal correspondence, written to inform Diallo of recent events in Guinea. But regardless of whether it was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>reasonable to expect that the letter would describe past events, remand would not be necessary because \u201cwe can state with confidence that the IJ would adhere to his decision were the petition remanded,\u201d because there are \u201cample, error-free grounds that provide substantial evidence to support the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination.\u201d <em>Singh v. BIA, </em>438 F.3d 145, 149-50 (2d Cir.2006) (quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b82-4\">The record, which contains specific instances of inconsistent testimony, supports the IJ\u2019s finding that Diallo\u2019s vague and unresponsive demeanor undermined his credibility. <em>See Li Hua Lin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>453 F.3d 99, 109 (2d Cir.2006); <em>Majidi v. Gonzales, </em>430 F.3d 77, 81 n. 1 (2d Cir.2005). Diallo gave conflicting testimony about whether he was arrested in January or July 2005, whether he was stripped naked in prison, and exactly how he was injured.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-5\">Contrary to Diallo, the IJ was not compelled to accept Diallo\u2019s explanation that he never said \u201cJanuary\u201d as the date of his arrest and that any mistake was a result of the confused immigration proceedings. See <em>Majidi, </em>430 F.3d at 80 (\u201cA petitioner must do more than offer a plausible explanation for his inconsistent statements to secure relief; he must demonstrate that a reasonable fact-finder would be compelled to credit his testimony.\u201d (emphasis in original; quotations omitted)). Similarly, we defer to the IJ\u2019s conclusion that Diallo\u2019s testimony was inconsistent concerning how he was injured and how he was stripped of his clothes. <em>See Siewe v. Gonzales, </em>480 F.3d 160, 170 (2d Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b82-6\">Together, Diallo\u2019s demeanor and the inconsistencies in his testimony constitute substantial evidence in support of the agency\u2019s adverse credibility determination. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(l)(B)(iii). Accordingly, the agency did not err in denying Diallo\u2019s applications for asylum, withholding of removal, or CAT relief based on that credibility finding. <em>See Paul v. Gonzales, </em>444 F.3d 148, 157 (2d Cir.2006). Because the agency\u2019s credibility finding supports the denial of relief, we need not address the agency\u2019s alternative finding that Diallo failed to meet his burden of proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-8\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. As we have completed our review, the pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot. Any pending request for oral argument in this petition is DENIED in accordance with Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 34(a)(2), and Second Circuit Local Rule 34.1(b).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
