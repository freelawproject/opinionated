Our jurisdiction is governed by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence the agency\u2019s factual findings. <em>Gonzalez-Hernandez v. Ashcroft, </em>336 F.3d 995, 998 (9th Cir.2003). We deny in part and dismiss in part the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-23\">Substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s conclusion that, even though Singh suffered past persecution, conditions have changed in India such that Singh no longer has a well-founded fear of persecution. <em>See Gonzalez-Hernandez, </em>336 F.3d at 1000-01 (individualized analysis of changed country conditions rebutted presumption of well-founded fear). Accordingly, Singh\u2019s asylum and withholding of removal claims fail. <em>See id </em>at 1001 fn. 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number>We lack jurisdiction to consider Singh\u2019s unexhausted claim that he is eligible for humanitarian asylum. <em>See Barron v. Ashcroft, </em>358 F.3d 674, 678 (9th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b673-5\">Finally, substantial evidence also supports the agency\u2019s denial of CAT relief, because Singh failed to establish it is more likely than not that he would be tortured if he returned to India. <em>See Wakkary v. Holder, </em>558 F.3d 1049, 1067-68 (9th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b673-6\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED in part; DISMISSED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b672-24\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9 th Cir.
