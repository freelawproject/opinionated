The district court denied that motion, and Sanehez-Salazar has appealed, contending that his trial lawyer rendered ineffective assistance.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-11\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-12\">Sanehez-Salazar was the first mate aboard a Panamanian-flagged vessel when it was \u201cstopped by the United States Coast Guard on the high seas off the coast of Honduras.\u201d <em>United States v. Aguilar, </em>286 Fed.Appx. 716, 718 (11th Cir.2008) (unpublished). The Coast Guard boarded the vessel and found 2,442 kilograms of cocaine. <em>Id. </em>Sanehez-Salazar was arrested, and a grand jury charged him with conspiracy to possess and possession of cocaine with intent to distribute while aboard a vessel subject to United States jurisdiction in violation of the Maritime Drug Law Enforcement Act, 46 U.S.C. app. \u00a7\u00a7 1901-1904 (2006).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Aguilar, </em>286 Fed.Appx. at 717-18. A jury found him guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-17\">The presentence investigation report recommended a total offense level of 40, which included a 2-level increase because Sanehez-Salazar was the first mate of the cocaine-carrying vessel. <em>See </em>United States Sentencing Guidelines \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(2)(B) (2006). Combined with his criminal history category of I, his guidelines range was 292 to 365 months in prison. The district court adopted the PSR and sentenced him to 292 months in prison. <em>Id. </em>at 719-20. We affirmed Sanehez-Salazar\u2019s convictions and sentence on direct appeal. <em>Id. </em>at 725.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-19\">Sanehez-Salazar then filed a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion, raising, among other things, two ineffective assistance of counsel claims. He asserted (1) that his trial lawyer should have argued that the Coast Guard\u2019s seizure of his vessel and his arrest violated the 1988 United Nations Convention Against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances, and (2) that his lawyer should have objected to the 2-level first-mate increase on the ground that it created an unwarranted sentence disparity between him and the vessel\u2019s chief engineer. The district court denied Sanchez-Salazar\u2019s motion, and he appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-20\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-21\">When reviewing a district court\u2019s denial of a \u00a7 2255 motion, we review for clear error the court\u2019s findings of fact and review <em>de novo </em>its application of the law to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"842\">*842</page-number>those facts. <em>Rhode v. United States, </em>583 F.3d 1289, 1290 (11th Cir.2009). To prevail on his ineffective assistance of counsel claims, Sanchez-Salazar must show that (1) his lawyer\u2019s performance was deficient and (2) the deficiency prejudiced him. <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 2064, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). To show that his lawyer\u2019s performance was deficient, he must show that the representation fell below \u201can objective standard of reasonableness ... under prevailing professional norms.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 688, 104 S.Ct. at 2064. To show prejudice, he \u201cmust show that there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 694, 104 S.Ct. at 2068.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-4\">Sanchez-Salazar contends that his lawyer was unconstitutionally ineffective by not arguing that the Coast Guard\u2019s search of his vessel and his arrest violated the U.N. Convention. The MDLEA, though, provides that a person charged with violating that statute \u201cdoes not have standing to raise a claim of failure to comply with international law as a basis for a defense.\u201d 46 U.S.C. app. \u00a7 1903(d); <em>see United States v. Matos-Luchi, </em>627 F.3d 1, 6 (1st Cir.2010) (\u201cThe defendants are not entitled to raise a violation of international law as an objection [to prosecution under the MDLEA]____\u201d (citation omitted)). So Sanchez-Salazar cannot establish that his lawyer\u2019s alleged deficiency was prejudicial.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-7\">Sanchez-Salazar also contends that his lawyer was unconstitutionally ineffective by not objecting to the 2-level first-mate increase he received under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(2)(B) on the ground that the increase created an unwarranted sentence disparity between him and the vessel\u2019s chief engineer, who did not receive the same increase. He, however, cannot show that the lawyer\u2019s failure to object on that ground was deficient under <em>Strickland. </em>At sentencing and on direct appeal, his lawyer argued that the first-mate increase was improper because the cocaine was being imported to Belize and not to the United States, but we \u2014 and the district court \u2014 rejected that argument. <em>Aguilar, </em>286 Fed.Appx. at 723-24. Sanchez-Salazar has not shown that his lawyer\u2019s decision to make an importation-based argument against the 2-level increase and not a disparity-based one falls below \u201can objective standard of reasonableness ... under prevailing professional norms.\u201d <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 688, 104 S.Ct. at 2064. Nor has he shown prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b869-13\">. Six months after Sanchez-Salazar was indicted, Congress recodified the MDLEA, which is now found at 46 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 70501-70507. <em>See </em>Act of Oct. 6, 2006, Pub.L. No. 109-304, \u00a7 10(2), 120 Stat. 1485, 1658-89. In this opinion, we cite to the pre-recodification version of the MDLEA.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
