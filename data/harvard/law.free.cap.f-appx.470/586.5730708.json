Our jurisdiction is governed by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence the agency\u2019s factual findings. <em>Wakkary v. Holder, </em>558 F.3d 1049, 1056 (9th Cir.2009). We deny in part and dismiss in part the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-9\">We lack jurisdiction to consider petitioners\u2019 argument that changed circumstances excused the untimely asylum application, because they did not raise this to the BIA. <em>See Barron v. Ashcroft, </em>358 F.3d 674, 678 (9th Cir.2004) (no jurisdiction over legal claims not presented in administrative proceedings below). Accordingly, because this is the only challenge to the agency\u2019s time-bar finding, we deny the petition as to petitioners\u2019 asylum claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-10\">With respect to withholding of removal, we lack jurisdiction to consider petitioners\u2019 new claim that they suffered past persecution because they did not raise this to the BIA. <em>See id. </em>In addition, even under a disfavored group analysis, petitioners have not shown sufficient individualized risk to establish a clear probability of persecution. <em>See Hoxha v. Ashcroft, </em>319 F.3d 1179, 1183 (9th Cir.2003); <em>Wakkary, </em>558 F.3d at 1066 (\u201c[a]n applicant for withholding of removal will need to adduce a considerably larger quantum of individualized-risk evidence\u201d). Accordingly, petitioners\u2019 withholding of removal claim fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-13\">Finally, we also lack jurisdiction over any challenge to the IJ\u2019s denial of CAT relief, and over petitioners\u2019 due process challenge to the deficiencies in the transcript, because petitioners did not raise these issues to the BIA. <em>See Barron, </em>358 F.3d at 678.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-14\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED in part; DISMISSED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b615-11\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
