Black, proceeding <em>pro se, </em>appeals the district court\u2019s order granting his lawyer\u2019s petition for authorization to charge Black reasonable attorney\u2019s fees, pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 406(b). No reversible error has been shown; we dismiss in part and affirm in part.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b766-8\">Black, represented by his lawyer Richard Culbertson, filed a complaint in the district court, seeking judicial review of the Social Security Commissioner\u2019s final decision denying his application for social security disability insurance and supplemental security income. The district court ruled in Black\u2019s favor, reversing the Commissioner\u2019s final decision and remanding the case for additional proceedings. The court also granted Black\u2019s petition for attorney\u2019s fees under the Equal Access to Justice Act (\u201cEAJA\u201d), 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2412(d), and directed the Commissioner to pay Culbertson $4,584.02 in attorney\u2019s fees.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b766-9\">After the Commissioner awarded Black past-due benefits on remand, Culbertson filed a petition seeking authorization to charge Black reasonable attorney\u2019s fees under section 406(b) for his representation in the district court. Culbertson attached a contingency fee agreement in which Black agreed to pay Culbertson 25% of his past-due benefits if the district court reversed or remanded the Commissioner\u2019s denial of benefits and if Black was then awarded past-due benefits. The agreement also provided that, if the court awarded attorney\u2019s fees under the EAJA, the amount of the EAJA award would be subtracted from the amount Black owed Culbertson based on his past-due benefits award. In a second amended report and recommendation (\u201cR &amp; R\u201d), the magistrate judge recommended that the court authorize Culbertson to charge Black $25,769.49 in reasonable attorney\u2019s fees, consistent with the terms of the contingency fee agreement. The district court overruled Black\u2019s objections and adopted the magistrate\u2019s second amended R &amp; R.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-14\">On appeal, Black argues that the district court erred in granting Culbertson\u2019s petition for authorization to charge reasonable attorney\u2019s fees.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We review an award of attorney\u2019s fees for an abuse of discretion. <em>ACLU of Ga. v. Barnes, </em>168 F.3d 423, 427 (11th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b766-15\">A district court may award reasonable attorney\u2019s fees as part of its judgment in favor of a Social Security claimant who was represented by a lawyer. <em>Jackson v. Comm\u2019r of Soc. Sec., </em>601 F.3d 1268, 1271 (11th Cir.2010) (citing 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 406(b)(1)(A)). The attorney\u2019s fee may not be more than \u201c25 percent of the total <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"739\">*739</page-number>of the past-due benefits to which the claimant is entitled by reason of such .judgment,\u201d and the court must determine whether the requested fee is reasonable based on the services rendered. <em>Id. </em>If an attorney receives attorney\u2019s fee under both the EAJA and ^section 406(b), he must refund the smaller fee to his client, but \u201cmay choose to effectuate the refund by deducting the amount of an earlier EAJA award from his subsequent [section] 406(b) fee request.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1274.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-5\">On remand from the district court, the Commissioner awarded Black a total of $129,672 in past-due Social Security benefits. Pursuant to the contingency fee agreement between Black and Culbertson, Culbertson\u2019s fee for a successful suit would equal 25% of Black\u2019s past-due benefits award ($32,418) minus the amount Culbertson received in EAJA awards (totaling $6,648.51), which amounted to $25,769.49. This fee is consistent with the parties\u2019 agreement and with the statutory limitations. In addition, the district court determined \u2014 and Black does not dispute \u2014 that this fee was reasonable based on Culbertson\u2019s representation. Thus, we see no abuse of discretion in the district court\u2019s award of attorney\u2019s fees under section 406(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b767-6\">We reject Black\u2019s assertion that because Culbertson had already received attorney\u2019s fees under the EAJA, the award of attorney\u2019s fees under section 406(b) was barred by res judicata,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Culbertson could not have requested authorization to charge attorney\u2019s fees as part of the earlier petition for EAJA fees because the Commissioner had not yet awarded Black past-due benefits on remand. Moreover, the award of attorney\u2019s fees under the EAJA and under section 406 do not constitute the same cause of action. <em>See Shurick v. Boeing Co., </em>623 F.3d 1114, 1116-17 (11th Cir.2010) (explaining that a claim is barred by <em>res judicata </em>\u201cwhenever (1) a court of competent jurisdiction has (2) rendered a final judgment on the merits in another case involving (3) the same parties and (4) the same cause of action.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b767-9\">Black also argues that the magistrate judge abused his discretion in denying Black\u2019s motion for an enlargement of time to respond to Culbertson\u2019s motions. We review a district court\u2019s interpretation and application of its local rules for abuse of discretion. <em>Mann v. Taser Int\u2019l, Inc., </em>588 F.3d 1291, 1302 (11th Cir.2009). Local Rule 3.01(g) requires a party \u201cfiling any motion in a civil case\u201d to confer with opposing counsel, to certify in his motion that he conferred with opposing counsel, and to state whether counsel agreed on the resolution of the motion. M.D. Fla. Rule 3.01(g). <em>Pro se </em>litigants are required to conform to such procedural rules. <em>Albra v. Advan, Inc., </em>490 F.3d 826, 829 (11th Cir.2007). Because Black did not confer with Culbertson or certify that he did so in his motion for an enlargement of time, the magistrate did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion for failure to comply with Local Rule 3.01(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b768-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"740\">*740</page-number>DISMISSED IN PART; AFFIRMED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b766-10\">. Black\u2019s motion to file excess pages for reply brief is granted.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b766-11\">. Culbertson also received $2,064.49 in EAJA fees based on his successful representation of Black in an earlier related case against the Commissioner.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b766-12\">. We dismiss as moot Black's argument that the magistrate judge abused his discretion in striking Black\u2019s objections to the initial R &amp; R because the magistrate later filed a second amended R &amp; R, gave Black the opportunity to object, and did not strike Black\u2019s objections. <em>See Brooks v. Ga. State Bd. of Elections, </em>59 F.3d 1114, 1119 (11th Cir.1995) (stating that we lack jurisdiction \"to decide questions which have become moot by reason of intervening events\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b767-7\">. We also reject \u2014 as unsupported by the record \u2014 Black\u2019s following arguments: (1) that the district court did not reverse the Commissioner\u2019s decision; (2) that the court awarded Culbertson fees for Black's administrative proceedings; (3) that Culbertson stole Black\u2019s identity to file the petition for fees; and (4) that Culbertson sought to collect a fee in excess of that allowed under section 406. In addition, nothing required Culbertson to obtain Black\u2019s permission before requesting authorization to charge attorney\u2019s fees or for Culbertson to continue representing Black after Black objected to the award of attorney's fees. We also reject Black's due process argument because Black was notified of Culbertson\u2019s request and was given an opportunity to object to the award before the district court adopted the magistrate's second amended R &amp; R.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
