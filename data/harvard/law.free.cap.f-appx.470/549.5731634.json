We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-8\">Substantial evidence supports the Board\u2019s denial of withholding of removal because Arango-Hernandez failed to show his alleged persecutors threatened him on account of a protected ground. His fear of future persecution based on an actual or imputed anti-gang or anti-crime opinion is not on account of the protected ground of either membership in a particular social group or political opinion. <em>Ramos Barrios v. Holder, </em>581 F.3d 849, 854-56 (9th Cir.2009); <em>Santos-Lemus v. Mukasey, </em>542 F.3d 738, 745-46 (9th Cir.2008); <em>see Ochave v. INS, </em>254 F.3d 859, 865 (9th Cir.2001) (\u201cAsylum generally is not available to victims of civil strife, unless they are singled out on account of a protected ground.\u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b578-10\">The Board did not abuse its discretion in denying Arango-Hernandez\u2019s motion to remand when he offered no evidence that he was targeted on account of a protected ground and the Board concluded he was a victim of criminal activity. <em>See Romero-Ruiz v. Mukasey, </em>538 F.3d 1057, 1062 (9th Cir.2008) (reviewing for abuse of discretion, which occurs if Board decision is \u201carbitrary, irrational, or contrary to law\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b578-11\">Because the Board properly denied relief for lack of a nexus, we need not address Arango-Hernandez\u2019s contention that he suffered past persecution or has a well-founded fear of future persecution by forces the Guatemalan government is unable or unwilling to control.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-12\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b578-9\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9 th Cir.
