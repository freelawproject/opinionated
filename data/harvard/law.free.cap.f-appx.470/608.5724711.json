Our jurisdiction is governed by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review de novo questions of law and for substantial evidence factual findings. <em>Husyev v. Mukasey, </em>528 F.3d 1172, 1177 (9th Cir.2008). We deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-22\">Substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s adverse credibility finding based on the inconsistency between Xia\u2019s written statement and his testimony regarding whether his mother was beaten when they were arrested. <em>See Pal v. INS, </em>204 F.3d 935, 939-40 (9th Cir.2000) (inconsistencies between testimony and application regarding injuries petitioner received during assaults went to heart of claim); <em>Wang v. INS, </em>352 F.3d 1250, 1259 (9th Cir.2003) (court is bound to accept ad<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>verse credibility finding as long as one identified ground is supported and goes to heart of claim). Xia\u2019s contention that he was not given a reasonable opportunity to explain the inconsistency is belied by the record. Accordingly, in the absence of credible testimony, we deny Xia\u2019s asylum and withholding of removal claims. <em>See Farah v. Ashcroft, </em>348 F.3d 1153, 1156 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b638-4\">Further, Xia\u2019s CAT claim fails because it is based on the same statements the agency found not credible, and the record does not otherwise compel a finding it is more likely than not he would be tortured by or with the acquiescence of the government if returned to China. <em>See id. </em>at 1156-57.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-5\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b637-16\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
