We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence, <em>Zamanov v. Holder, </em>649 F.3d 969, 973 (9th Cir.2011), and we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-22\">Substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s adverse credibility determination based upon the omission from Hydara\u2019s asylum application of any attack on himself, and on his differing accounts regarding the attack on his family. <em>See id. </em>(\u201cMaterial alterations in the applicant\u2019s account of persecution are sufficient to support an adverse credibility finding.\u201d). The agency reasonably rejected Hydara\u2019s explanations for the omission and inconsistencies. <em>See Rivera v. Mukasey, </em>508 F.3d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>1271, 1275 (9th Cir.2007). Accordingly, in the absence of credible testimony, Hydara\u2019s asylum and withholding of removal claims fail. <em>See Farah v. Ashcroft, </em>348 F.3d 1153, 1156 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b675-5\">Finally, because Hydara\u2019s CAT claim is based on the same testimony found to be not credible, and he does not point to any other evidence that shows it is more likely than not that he will be tortured if returned to Sierra Leone, his CAT claim also fails. <em>See id. </em>at 1156-57.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-6\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b674-23\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
