We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for abuse of discretion the BIA\u2019s denial of motions to reopen or to remand. <em>Guzman v. INS, </em>318 F.3d 911, 912 n. 1 (9th Cir.2003). We deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-12\">Sihombing contends the BIA erred in denying his request for further consideration of his application for withholding of removal based on a disfavored group analysis. However, Sihombing does not challenge the BIA\u2019s dispositive finding that his motion was untimely and that he did not qualify for an exception to the time limitation. <em>See Martinez-Serrano v. INS, </em>94 F.3d 1256, 1259-60 (9th Cir.1996) (issues not specifically raised and argued in a party\u2019s opening brief are waived).</p>\n<p id=\"b647-16\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b647-14\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
