We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review de novo. <em>Romano v. Bible, </em>169 F.3d 1182, 1185 (9th Cir.1999). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-20\">The district court properly dismissed Wilson\u2019s claims against defendant Richins, a Nevada Department of Administration Appeals Officer, in her official and individual capacities. <em>See Flint v. Dennison, </em>488 F.3d 816, 824-25 (9th Cir.2007) (Eleventh Amendment bars damages actions against state officials in their official capacity); <em>Romano, </em>169 F.3d at 1186 (absolute immunity extends to state officials, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>including those sued in their individual capacity, \u201cwhen they preside over hearings ... or otherwise perform functions analogous to judges\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b684-4\">The district court properly dismissed Wilson\u2019s due process claims because Wilson failed to allege facts sufficient to show that defendants acted in a \u201cconscience shocking\u201d manner, or that Wilson did not receive an adequate opportunity to be heard. <em>See Brittain v. Hansen, </em>451 F.3d 982, 998 (9th Cir.2006) (\u201cIt is not conscience shocking that an officer would act in a non-identical fashion in cases presenting similar (though not identical) factual circumstances.\u201d); <em>Raditch v. United States, </em>929 F.2d 478, 480 (9th Cir.1991) (procedural due process claim requires showing a lack of notice and an opportunity to be heard).</p>\n<p id=\"b684-5\">The district court properly dismissed Wilson\u2019s equal protection claim because Wilson failed to allege facts sufficient to support his claim. <em>See Monteiro v. Tempe Union High Sch. Dist., </em>158 F.3d 1022, 1026 (9th Cir.1998) (equal protection claim \u201cmust plead intentional unlawful discrimination or allege facts that are at least susceptible of an inference of discriminatory intent\u201d); <em>see also Ashcroft v. Iqbal, </em>556 U.S. 662, 129 S.Ct. 1937, 1948, 1951-52, 1954, 173 L.Ed.2d 868 (2009) (for purposeful discrimination, a plaintiff must plead sufficient facts to give rise to a plausible inference that a decisionmaker undertook a course of action because of, not merely in spite of, the action\u2019s adverse effects upon an identifiable group).</p>\n<p id=\"b684-6\">Wilson\u2019s remaining contentions, including those regarding the rebuttable presumption in Nevada Revised Statutes \u00a7 617.453(5), are unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b683-13\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
