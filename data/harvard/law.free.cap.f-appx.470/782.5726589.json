Introduction</p>\n<p id=\"b812-9\">Yasmanny Benavides appeals his conviction and sentencing on two counts of healthcare fraud and one count of conspiracy to commit the same. He alleges error on a number of rulings made by the district court. He also claims the court erred by applying to his sentence the four-level \u201corganizer or leader\u201d enhancement found in the <em>Sentencing Guidelines. </em>For the reasons discussed below, the district court\u2019s decision is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-10\">II. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b812-11\">Miami was a hotbed for Medicare fraud in the early 2000s. One popular scheme involved forging prescriptions for expensive Durable Medical Equipment (DME), and then using an equipment company to invoice Medicare for reimbursement. To combat this epidemic, the FBI began a number of investigations in the Miami area. And these investigations bore fruit: the agency executed about 40 search warrants on August 18, 2004, including one to search All-Med Billing, a company that helped a number of DME companies commit fraud.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-14\">Against this backdrop, Reinaldo Guerra \u2014 the Government\u2019s star witness against Benavides \u2014 ran more than 21 fraudulent DME companies. Guerra got his start in 2002, acting as the straw owner of Kathy Medical, a DME company engaged in billing Medicare fraudulently. Another man, Jose Luis Perez, had provided the purchase money for Kathy, handled all of the initial paperwork, and brought Guerra into the fold. Once in, Guerra cashed the Medicare checks sent to Kathy at Cash-flow Financial, a check-cashing outfit, and divided the profits with Perez after repaying him the initial purchase money. To protect Perez, only Guerra\u2019s name appeared on Kathy\u2019s paperwork. The duo eventually closed Kathy Medical, and Guerra graduated from his role as straw man, assuming ownership of two new companies. One of these was Lacary Medical, a company that Guerra had purchased at the suggestion of Greico Herrada.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-15\">It was at this point that Benavides entered the picture. Guerra and Herrada proposed that Benavides sign on as the nominal owner of Lacary, which required him to put his name on the paperwork closing the sale and the documents authorizing All-Med to do Lacary\u2019s billing. In return, Benavides received 20% of the company\u2019s profits.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-16\">Medicare eventually quit paying claims made by Lacary. At this point, Benavides asked Guerra to set up another DME company. According to Guerra\u2019s testimony, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"785\">*785</page-number>Erich Ruiz found Lily Orthopedic and agreed to sign on as nominal owner. Benavides and Guerra bought Lily for $90,000 on November 21, 2003, and they installed Ruiz as the strawman as planned. Ruiz, like Guerra and Benavides before him, signed the documents necessary for All-Med to handle the Medicare billing for Lily and for Cashflow to cash the Medicare checks obtained through the scheme.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-5\">All told, the trio bilked Medicare out of $4.7 million using Lily, a company that neither bought nor sold a single piece of medical equipment from December 2003 to August 2004, the time of the alleged conspiracy.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-6\">III. The Proceedings Below</p>\n<p id=\"b813-7\">This case began when the United States indicted Benavides and Ruiz on August 4, 2009. The indictment charged the pair with conspiracy to commit health care fraud (Count 1); three substantive counts of health care fraud (Counts 2-4); and-three counts of aggravated identity theft (Counts 5 \u2014 7).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Ruiz pled guilty; Benavides took his case to trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-8\">Just before trial, Benavides sought to keep evidence related to the Lacary fraud from coming into evidence. To this end, he filed a motion in limine, which the district court denied. The district court\u2019s order also denied Benavides\u2019 request to limit the scope of the evidence presented about Lacary. The court did however grant Benavides\u2019 request for a standing objection to the admission of the Lacary evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-9\">During the trial, Benavides objected to the Government\u2019s attempt to introduce documents found during the FBI\u2019s search of Cashflow. These documents \u2014 which ostensibly linked Benavides to Lily \u2014 were receipts with handwritten notations. Three of the receipts had written on them \u201cBenabide (Lily Orthop.).\u201d The other one read, \u201cKing (Lily orthopedic).\u201d Benavides claimed the receipts were inadmissible hearsay and, either way, lacked sufficient authentication. The Government responded, claiming that Raul Martinez, a Cash-flow employee, wrote them, and that testimony by Rolf Gjertsen, an FBI agent, provided a sufficient foundation for admitting the receipts. The district court overruled Benavides\u2019 objection and allowed in the evidence as a co-conspirator statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-14\">Benavides likewise objected to the Government\u2019s use of summary charts in its case-in-chief. The objection had its genesis in the Government\u2019s decision to call fourteen doctors who had their physician numbers used by either Lacary or Lily to submit false claims to Medicare. The Government had summary charts prepared so the doctors could easily identify the claims submitted under each doctor\u2019s name and physician number. Because the title on each chart read \u201cLacary Medical Equipment/Lily Orthopedic,\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Benavides objected and claimed that the charts would tend to mislead the jury by commingling the claims submitted by each company, thus conflating the two schemes. The district court overruled this objection too.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-15\">Guerra testified at length about his involvement in the Kathy, Lacary, and Lily schemes. During cross-examination, Benavides brought up the deal given to Guerra for testifying and established that Guerra sought to get his 14-year sentence reduced by up to a third because of his cooperation. The <em>Sentencing Guidelines </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"786\">*786</page-number>calculation was important to the defense\u2019s cross, because it showed that Guerra had something to gain from the Government by testifying. Confusion ensued after the prosecution\u2019s redirect on the issue, and as a result, Benavides sought to recall Guerra after he had left the stand. The district court denied Benavides\u2019 request.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-4\">Ruiz testified against Benavides at trial too. During his testimony, it came out that he had a prior conviction for selling prescription drugs illegally and for operating an illegal Internet pharmacy. Ruiz denied that his previous charges dealt with forging prescriptions, however, claiming that he merely continued working with a pharmacist whose license had expired. When Benavides attempted to cross Ruiz about the facts underlying his prior conviction, the prosecution objected. Benavides responded by claiming that he should get to inquire into the underlying facts of each crime \u201cbecause the facts of his conviction are extremely relevant to the facts of this case.\u201d (VIII Tr. at 149.) The district court disagreed and excluded the evidence because Benavides could not establish that Ruiz\u2019s convictions had any connection to the case at hand.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-5\">Benavides testified as well. While on the stand, he admitted his involvement with Lacary, yet he maintained his innocence as to the Lily scheme. Benavides said that Herrada offered him a job with Lacary, telling Benavides that he would act as President of the company since Guerra wanted to keep his name off of any company documents. This prompted a hearsay objection by the Government. Benavides\u2019 counsel responded by stating that Benavides knew the statements were false and that he did not want to offer them for the truth of the matter. The court overruled the objection and then issued an instruction, telling the jury, \u201cThese statements are not coming in for the truth of the matter asserted.\u201d Benavides then went on to describe his involvement in Lacary and how he disassociated himself with the company.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-7\">At close, the Government told the jury that it had failed to indict Benavides for his involvement with Lacary before the five-year statute of limitations ran. Benavides immediately moved for a mistrial, which the district court denied. As the Assistant United States Attorney continued with his closing, he told the jury they could use Benavides\u2019 involvement with Lacary \u201cas proof of the Defendant\u2019s involvement with Lily Orthopedic.\u201d Then, he claimed that the adding machine receipts were unassailable because they were not subject to cross-examination. He also referred to the \u201cyeomen\u2019s work\u201d the FBI agents testifying for the Government \u201cdid on behalf of the American public.\u201d Finally, he responded to Benavides\u2019 argument about not initially knowing of Lacary\u2019s fraudulent nature by asking, \u201cAt what point does a law-abiding person walk out the door?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b814-8\">At the end of closing arguments, the district court overruled Benavides\u2019 objection to the offered conspiracy instruction and denied his request asking the court to amend it to include the object of the conspiracy as the third element of the crime. The district court then sent the case to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-9\">The jury returned with a split verdict: it convicted Benavides on the first four counts (conspiracy and health care fraud) but acquitted him on the last three (aggravated identity theft). At his sentencing, Benavides received an initial base offense level of six under \u00a7 2Bl.l(a)(2) of the <em>United States Sentencing Guidelines. </em>Numerous enhancements applied, including a 20-level increase because the loss surpassed $7 million but fell short of $20 million, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(l)(k); a 4-lev-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"787\">*787</page-number>el bump because Benavides acted as an organizer or leader of a criminal activity involving five or more people or that was otherwise extensive, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3Bl.l(a); and, finally, a 2-level addition for obstruction of justice, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-4\">Shortly afterward, the district court sentenced Benavides to 144 months in prison and ordered him to pay restitution. He now asks for a new trial or, in the alternative, a reduced sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-5\">IV. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b815-6\">A. Admission of evidence of the uncharged Lacary fraud, fourteen summary charts, and the handwritten notations on four adding machine tapes</p>\n<p id=\"b815-7\">We begin with the district court\u2019s decision to allow in certain pieces of evidence over objections made by Benavides. In reviewing these matters, we apply a deferential abuse of discretion standard to the district court\u2019s rulings. <em>United States v. Trujillo, </em>146 F.3d 838, 843 (11th Cir.1998). If we find an abuse of discretion, we still will'not reverse the trial court \u2014 at least not on a non-constitutional question \u2014 unless there exists a reasonable likelihood the error affected the defendant\u2019s substantial rights. <em>United States v. Range, </em>94 F.3d 614, 620 (11th Cir.1996). With this in mind, we address each of Benavides\u2019 allegations related to the district court\u2019s evidentiary rulings.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-8\">1. Evidence of the uncharged Lacary scheme</p>\n<p id=\"b815-9\">Benavides claims the district court abused its discretion by admitting evidence of the Lacary fraud as \u201cinextricably intertwined\u201d with the charged offense. More specifically, he claims the Lacary and Lily fraud were distinct events, thus making the Lacary evidence inadmissible, for it would tend to prove Benavides\u2019 character (fraudster) and show action in conformity with that character (the fraudster committed fraud).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-12\">True, a party generally cannot use \u201c[e]vidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts\u201d to prove a person\u2019s bad character and \u201cshow action in conformity therewith.\u201d Fed. R.Evid. 404(b). But bad acts evidence falls outside of this prohibition \u2014 indeed, it falls outside of Rule 404(b) altogether \u2014 if it is not extrinsic to, but instead part of, the charged crime. This occurs if the bad acts are \u201c(1) an uncharged offense which arose out of the same transaction or series of transactions as the charged offense, (2) necessary to complete the story of the crime, or (3) inextricably intertwined with the evidence regarding the charged offense.\u201d <em>United States v. Utter, </em>97 F.3d 509, 514 (11th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b815-13\">For example, in <em>United States v. Foster, </em>889 F.2d 1049, 1053 (11th Cir.1989), this Court upheld a district court\u2019s admission of testimony about one of the defendant\u2019s prior drug smuggling trips while on trial for a later one, because the central issue was whether the defendant just went along for the ride or if he actively participated in the scheme. In upholding the district court\u2019s decision, this Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AUQ\">Testimony concerning the September 13th trip did not merely implicate Mr. Foster\u2019s bad character or propensity to traffick in drugs, it specifically described his participation in a scheme involving the same mode of transportation (a commercial airline) between the same cities <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"788\">*788</page-number>(Miami and Savannah), to smuggle the same amount (one kilogram) of the same drug (cocaine), in the same manner of hiding it (in a girdle) on the same person (Ms. Davis)-only 17 days prior to his arrest for a virtually identical transaction.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b816-4\"><em>Foster, </em>889 F.2d at 1053. Here, the Lacary testimony described Benavides\u2019 participation in a scheme involving the same manner of fraud (submitting false Medicare claims), using the same type of company (one claiming to sell DME), hiring the same intermediaries to bill the claims and launder the money (All-Med and Cashflow), and involving the same main players (Guerra and Benavides) \u2014 shortly after Medicare quit making reimbursement payments to Lacary. The district court, therefore, stayed within its sound discretion by admitting the evidence as inextricably intertwined with the charged offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-5\">2. The fourteen summary charts</p>\n<p id=\"b816-6\">For the sake of convenience, a party can use summary charts to present in court \u201cotherwise voluminous\u201d information. Fed.R.Evid. 1006. Still, \u201csummary charts are to be used with caution, due to their potential for abuse,\u201d <em>United States v. Richardson, </em>233 F.3d 1285, 1293 (11th Cir.2000), and a trial court has \u201cto make certain that an accused is not unjustly convicted in a \u2018trial by charts.\u2019 \u201d <em>Gordon v. United States, </em>438 F.2d 858, 876 (5th Cir.1971) (citations omitted).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> But the likelihood of error in admitting a summary chart diminishes \u201cwhere the defenses has the opportunity to cross-examine a witness concerning the disputed issue and to present its own version of the case.\u201d <em>Richardson, </em>233 F.3d at 1294.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-8\">In <em>Richardson, </em>the district court gave numerous limiting instructions to the jury, the Government\u2019s witness said the chart\u2019s label represented only his opinion, and the label was ultimately changed before the charts went to the jury. 233 F.3d at 1294. Benavides makes much of the district court\u2019s failure to use the exact same prophylactic measures in his case. But <em>Richardson </em>created no such rigid requirement. To the contrary, this Court stressed that district courts have wide discretion to admit summary charts \u201cso long as supporting evidence has been presented previously to the jury\u201d and \u201cthe court has made clear that the ultimate decision should be made by the jury as to what weight should be given to the evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>United States v. Francis, </em>131 F.3d 1452, 1458 (11th Cir.1997)).</p>\n<p id=\"b816-9\">Here, the Government used two additional charts to separate out the Lacary and Lily frauds, which lessened the possibility of juror confusion. Benavides also had an opportunity to cross-examine Gjertsen on all of the charts, thus giving him the opportunity to clear up any misconceptions about the nature of the schemes. Most importantly, the underlying facts and jury instructions made clear that Benavides was on trial for the Lily scheme instead of the Lacary fraud, which helped minimize the likelihood of error. <em>See United States v. Scott, </em>427 Fed.Appx. 869 (11th Cir.2011) (per curiam). The district court consequently did not err by admitting the summary charts.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-10\">3. The handwritten notations on the adding machine tapes</p>\n<p id=\"b816-11\">A statement falls outside of the definition of hearsay if it is \u201ca statement by a co-conspirator of a party during the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"789\">*789</page-number>course and in furtherance of the conspiracy.\u201d Fed.R.Evid. 801(d)(2)(E). To admit evidence under this rule, there \u201cmust be evidence that there was a conspiracy involving the declarant and the nonoffering party, and that the statement was made \u2018during the course and in furtherance of the conspiracy.\u2019 \u201d <em>Bourjaily v. United States, </em>488 U.S. 171, 175, 107 S.Ct. 2775, 97 L.Ed.2d 144 (1991) (citing Fed.R.Evid. 801(d)(2)(E)); <em>United States v. West, </em>142 F.3d 1408, 1414 (11th Cir.1998), <em>vacated on other grounds, </em>526 U.S. 1155, 119 S.Ct. 2042, 144 L.Ed.2d 211 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b817-5\">Benavides claims the district court erred by admitting the notes without knowing the identity of the author or the circumstances surrounding the drafting. But a district court need not specifically identify the author if circumstantial evidence shows that the document\u2019s author had intimate involvement in the operation of the conspiracy. <em>United States v. Smith, </em>918 F.2d 1501, 1510-11 (11th Cir.1990). Only without such circumstantial proof does \u201cuncertainty as to the identity of the declarant ... implicate! ] the concerns which justify the general prohibition on hearsay evidence; namely, its lack of trustworthiness.\u201d <em>United States v. Christopher, </em>923 F.2d 1545, 1551 (11th Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b817-6\">The district court made the findings required by <em>Bourjaily. </em>Judge Lenard found that the conspiracy existed, that Benavides was a member, and that someone made the notations in furtherance of the conspiracy. And although the unknown identify of the author is troublesome, circumstantial evidence indicates the document\u2019s trustworthiness: testimony established that Benavides and Guerra used Cashflow Financing to further their conspiracy, that the FBI found the tapes at Cashflow, and that the FBI maintained a sound chain-of-custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-9\">The receipts, moreover, referred to Benavides and \u201cKing,\u201d which was Guerra\u2019s nickname. In <em>Smith, </em>the trial court admitted a ledger with an unknown author that made reference to other co-conspirators, partly because the color codes in the ledger matched a color-coded business card found on one of the defendants during a search. 918 F.2d at 1505. Like the business card in <em>Smith, </em>which connected the co-conspirators and conspiracy itself to the ledgers, the references to both Benavides and Guerra on the receipts, combined with Guerra\u2019s testimony about the duo engaging in a conspiracy to defraud Medicare, connects the adding tape notations to Benavides and the conspiracy itself. And this connection suggests that the author, although unknown, had an intimate connection with the conspiracy \u2014 or at least a close enough connection for the trial court to admit the evidence. Thus, the trial court did not abuse its discretion by admitting the four adding machine receipts.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b817-10\">B. The district court\u2019s decision to limit Benavides\u2019 cross-examination of some of the Government\u2019s key witnesses</p>\n<p id=\"b817-11\">To merit reversal for limiting the permissible scope of cross-examination, the district court must commit a clear abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Jones, </em>913 F.2d 1552, 1564 (11th Cir.1990); <em>United States v. Calle, </em>822 F.2d 1016, 1019-1020 (11th Cir.1987). A district court has no power, however, to keep a defendant from impeaching a witness\u2019s credibility with pri- or convictions for crimes involving dishonesty. Fed.R.Evid. 609(a)(2) (\u201cevidence that any witness has been convicted of a crime <em>shall </em>be admitted ... if it readily can be determined that establishing the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"790\">*790</page-number>elements of the crime required proof or admission of an act of dishonesty or false statement by the -witness.\u201d) (emphasis added); <em>United States v. Toney, </em>615 F.2d 277 (5th Cir.1980). In fact, \u201ca cross-examiner has an absolute right to introduce a crimen falsi conviction for impeachment purposes.\u201d <em>Toney, </em>615 F.2d at 278. But this rule does not apply to impeachment by contradiction or to convictions offered to prove things like knowledge, intent, or identity under Rule 404(b). <em>See, e.g., United States v. Watchmaker, </em>761 F.2d 1459, 1474 (11th Cir.1985) (holding conviction not subject <em>to </em>Rule 609 when offered for purpose other than impeaching credibility with conviction involving dishonesty); <em>United States v. Davis, </em>787 F.2d 1501, 1504 (11th Cir.1986) (citing <em>Watchmaker </em>and stating, \u201cIn this case, the government asked Davis about the conviction not to cast doubt on his credibility but to dispel the illusion that he gave the jury that he had never possessed an illegal substance.\u201d); Christopher B. Mueller &amp; Laird C. Kirkpatrick, 3 <em>Federal Evidence </em>\u00a7 6:57 (3d ed. 2011) (\u201c[Rule] 609 does not apply to convictions offered to refute a witness who denies the underlying misconduct, or to prove circumstantially such things as knowledge, intent, or identity under [Rule] 404(b).\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b818-4\">1. Limiting cross-examination into the underlying facts of Ruiz\u2019s pri- or conviction involving dishonesty</p>\n<p id=\"b818-5\">Benavides claims the district court erred by barring him from impeaching Ruiz with a prior conviction. While testifying, Ruiz admitted to an arrest for participating in an illegal Internet pharmacy scheme. When Benavides\u2019 attorney asked Ruiz about a second set of charges stemming from the same incident, Ruiz claimed the new charges dealt with him working with a pharmacist after his license had expired. Defense counsel asked about the second charge in more detail; the prosecution objected. At this point, Judge Lenard held a sidebar and, after defense counsel asserted that Ruiz\u2019s prior conviction related to the charged offense, prohibited further questioning into the matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-7\">Benavides claims Rule 609(a)(2) allowed him to question Ruiz on the underlying facts of the second conviction because the crime involved dishonesty and since Ruiz allegedly misrepresented the nature of the conviction. But Benavides\u2019 attorney proffered to Judge Lenard that she sought to have the convictions admitted to show that Ruiz learned from Guerra how to engage in the fraud for which Ruiz was arrested in 2005. Defense counsel never argued that the prior convictions involved proof of acts of dishonesty or false statements by Ruiz. Thus Rule 609(a)(2) did not apply to Judge Lenard\u2019s decision; Rule 404(b) did. <em>See Watchmaker, </em>761 F.2d at 1474.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-8\">Under Rule 404(b), Judge Lenard had leeway to limit the line of questioning Benavides\u2019 counsel sought to employ, especially considering how Ruiz denied a connection between the two cases. <em>See </em>Fed. R.Evid. 404(b)(2) (providing trial court discretion to admit or exclude bad acts evidence used to prove \u201cpurpose, ... motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, absence of mistake, or lack of accident.\u201d). In fact, Judge Lenard appears to have implicitly undertook the Rule 404(b)(2) analysis by asking defense counsel during the sidebar whether Ruiz\u2019s prior conviction had any connection to the charges against Benavides. After she did, defense counsel replied, \u201cit\u2019s my theory, your Honor, that he learned how to do all this while he was working with Reinaldo Guerra,\u201d to which the court responded, \u201cBut you haven\u2019t been able to establish that. [Ruiz] said no to that question.\u201d (VIII Tr. at 150.) This exchange makes clear that Benavides\u2019 lawyer sought to ask <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"791\">*791</page-number>Ruiz about his convictions not to impeach his credibility by showing that he had committed a crime involving dishonesty, but instead to show that Guerra had taught Ruiz how to commit fraud. Because the convictions fell outside the ambit of Rule 609 when offered for this reason, we cannot say that Judge Lenard abused her discretion by prohibiting questioning into the details surrounding Ruiz\u2019s conviction for forging prescriptions.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b819-5\">2. Limiting cross-examination of Agent Gjertsen</p>\n<p id=\"b819-6\">Benavides alleges the trial court abused its discretion by deciding to limit his cross-examination of Rolf Gjertsen, the FBI agent who testified for the Government. He claims that by keeping defense counsel from asking Gjertsen about whether he prepared the charts in anticipation of litigation, the court ran afoul of <em>Delaware v. Van Arsdall, </em>a case finding that a Sixth Amendment violation occurs when a trial court cuts off all questioning about the source of a witness\u2019s bias. 475 U.S. 673, 106 S.Ct. 1431, 89 L.Ed.2d 674 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b819-7\">In <em>Van Arsdall, </em>the Supreme Court held that a criminal defendant should get to expose \u201ca witness\u2019 motivation for testifying.\u201d 475 U.S. at 679, 106 S.Ct. 1431. And given this right, the trial court in that case erred by barring defense counsel from asking about the deal the witness received from the government in exchange for testifying. <em>Id. </em>Still, the <em>Van Arsdall </em>Court made clear that the Confrontation Clause does not \u201cprevent[ ] a trial judge from imposing ... limits on defense counsel\u2019s inquiry into the potential bias of a prosecution witness.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b819-8\">Whereas <em>Van Arsdall </em>dealt with asking about the presence of a plea deal exchanged for the witness\u2019s testimony, this case deals with Benavides\u2019 lawyer\u2019s attempts to ask Agent Gjertsen about preparing charts in anticipation of litigation. The answer to the former is far more probative of bias than the answer to the latter. What is more, Agent Gjertsen took part in the investigation of Benavides, which likely made it apparent to the jury that he played for the same team as the Government. So unlike the witness in <em>Van Arsdall </em>who had a hidden motivation for cooperating, Gjertsen\u2019s potential bias was patent. Given these differences, and because Judge Lenard permitted questioning about the charts until defense counsel began asking redundant questions about what each one plainly said, the district court exercised its discretion without violating Benavides\u2019 constitutional right to confront witnesses against him. <em>See Van Arsdall, </em>475 U.S. at 679, 106 S.Ct. 1431 (\u201ctrial judges retain wide latitude insofar as the Confrontation Clause is concerned to impose reasonable limits on such cross-examination based on concerns about, among other things, harassment, prejudice, confusion of the issues ... or interrogation that is repetitive or only marginally relevant.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b819-11\">3. Limiting cross-examination regarding Guerra\u2019s benefits for cooperating</p>\n<p id=\"b819-12\">Benavides next claims the district court erred by allowing a misstatement by Guerra to go uncorrected. During Guerra\u2019s direct examination by the Government, the prosecutor elicited from him that the Court used $99 million as the final loss figure for calculating his sentencing guideline range. Guerra further stated that he did not receive a break because the court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"792\">*792</page-number>sentenced him to a top-of-the-guidelines range despite the Government recommending a sentence at the bottom of the range. But during Benavides\u2019 cross, Guerra admitted that the Government refrained from charging him for other frauds that would have pushed his guidelines calculation higher, thus showing that Guerra did in fact receive a benefit from the Government despite his claims to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-4\">On redirect, the prosecutor asked, \u201cIf you were charged with $179 million in loss, you had, what, some $21 million to go before you could fall into the next highest category?\u201d Guerra answered yes and, significantly, Benavides\u2019 lawyer failed to object to either the question or the answer. Yet defense counsel sought to recall Guerra and re-cross him. The district court denied this request, stating that Benavides made clear that Guerra received benefits for testifying.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-5\">The district court stayed within its discretion here for two reasons. First, Benavides had an opportunity to cross-examine Guerra. And defense counsel used that opportunity to impugn Guerra\u2019s credibility by showing he received a greater benefit from the Government than he initially let on during direct examination. Second, Benavides failed to object to any incorrect impressions created by the prosecution during re-direct. The district court, therefore, did not abuse its discretion by denying the request to recall Guerra for recross.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-7\">C. Benavides\u2019 claims of prosecutorial misconduct</p>\n<p id=\"b820-8\">A prosecutorial misconduct claim requires a defendant to show that the prosecutor acted improperly and that the improper conduct prejudicially affected his substantial rights. <em>Sexton v. Howard, </em>55 F.3d 1557, 1559 (11th Cir.1995) (citation omitted). The defendant also must show that, but for the improper conduct, the trial would have produced a different outcome. <em>Id.; United States v. Eyster, 948 </em>F.2d 1196, 1206-07 (11th Cir.1991). In undertaking this inquiry, we must evaluate the prosecutor\u2019s remarks \u201cin the context of the trial as a whole and assess their probable impact on the jury.\u201d <em>United States v. Hernandez, </em>145 F.3d 1433, 1438 (11th Cir.1998). And we must do so while keeping in mind that the trial court sits in the best position to evaluate the prejudicial effect of evidence on the jury, meaning that we will only overturn the a trial judge\u2019s decision if she abused her discretion in denying a motion for a mistrial. <em>United States v. Mendez, </em>117 F.3d 480, 484 (11th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b820-9\">During closing arguments, the prosecutor referenced the statute of limitations and explained how it kept the Government from charging Benavides for the Lacary fraud. These comments were improper: they lacked relevance while suggesting to the jury that Benavides escaped criminal liability on a technicality for a fraud that he admitted to participating in.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>Cf. Olinger v. Comm\u2019r of Internal Revenue, </em>234 F.2d 823, 824 (5th Cir.1956) (\u201c[T]he risk that a jury will convict the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"793\">*793</page-number>defendant for crimes other than those charged-or that, uncertain of guilt, it will convict anyway because a bad person deserves punishment-creates a prejudicial effect that outweighs ordinary relevance.\u201d). Even so, we cannot look at these comments in a vacuum. Rather, we have to look at the totality of the evidence and ask whether a different outcome would have resulted but for the prosecutor making the comments.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-5\">We are not so convinced. The trial produced plenty of evidence implicating Benavides in defrauding Medicare and entering into a conspiracy to use Lily Orthopedic to this end. Guerra, a co-conspirator, testified on this point. So too did Ruiz, another co-conspirator. The adding machine tapes found at Cashflow amounted to documentary evidence linking Benavides to the fraud. And his own admissions related to his participation in Lacary showed that he had the knowledge necessary to carry out such a scheme. Given the overwhelming amount of evidence implicating Benavides, we cannot say that anything more than a speculative probability exists as to whether the jury would have acquitted him but for the prosecutor\u2019s improper remarks.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-6\">D. Benavides\u2019 cumulative error claim</p>\n<p id=\"b821-7\">Benavides claims that the issues discussed above, combined with an ostensibly improper jury charge and hearsay instruction, establish cumulative error.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-8\">A claim of cumulative error looks to \u201cthe prejudicial effect of all evidentiary errors, evaluated under both preserved and plain error standards, in the aggregate.\u201d <em>United States v. Baker, </em>432 F.3d 1189, 1203 (11th Cir.2005) (citations omitted). A court will overturn a verdict \u201cif the cumulative effect of the errors is prejudicial, even if the prejudice caused by each individual error was harmless.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In addressing a cumulative error claim, \u201ccourts look to see whether the defendant\u2019s substantial rights were affected.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1224. \u201cThe total effect of the errors on the trial will depend, among other things, on \u2018the nature and number of the errors committed; their interrelationship, if any, and combined effect; how the district court dealt with errors as they arose (including the efficacy \u2014 or lack of efficacy \u2014 of any remedial efforts); the strength of the government\u2019s case,\u2019 and the length of trial.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b821-10\">Because the district court did not err as to the claims already discussed, Benavides\u2019 claim of cumulative error hinges on an allegedly improper jury charge and limiting instruction. Beginning with his jury charge claim, Benavides had to show that his requested instruction correctly stated the law, concerned an issue so substantive that its omission impaired his defense, dealt with an issue properly before the jury, and was omitted from the charge actually give to the jury. <em>United States v. Dulcio, </em>441 F.3d 1269, 1275 (11th Cir.2006) (citations omitted). He cannot meet the first <em>Dulci\u00f3 </em>prong: his proffered jury instruction dealt with 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 286, which has a third element, instead of the statute he allegedly violated, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1349, which has only two elements. As to the hearsay instruction given by the trial court on its own motion, Benavides claims that the phrase \u201cnot coming in for the truth\u201d suggested that Benavides\u2019 testimony lacked trustworthiness. But not only was the instruction a correct statement of the law, see Fed.R.Evid. 801(c), Benavides\u2019 own lawyer said, in front of the jury, \u201cIt\u2019s not offered for the truth, your Honor,\u201d right before Judge Lenard used similar phrasing in her limiting instruc<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"794\">*794</page-number>tion.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Because the trial court did not err as to the claims raised by Benavides, his cumulative error claim fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-4\">E. The \u201corganizer or leader\u201d enhancement</p>\n<p id=\"b822-5\">As a general rule, this Court reviews de novo a district court\u2019s interpretation of the <em>Sentencing Guidelines. United States v. Mandhai, 375 </em>F.3d 1243, 1247 (11th Cir.2004). Under the <em>Guidelines, </em>a district court can impose a four-level enhancement to a defendant\u2019s sentence \u201cif the defendant was an organizer or leader of a criminal activity that involved five or more participants or was otherwise extensive.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3Bl.l(a). \u201cTo qualify for an adjustment under this section, the defendant must have been organizer, leader, ... of one or more other participants.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.1 cmt. n. 2; <em>United States v. Curtis, </em>635 F.3d 704, 720 (5th Cir.2011) (finding defendant only had to supervise one other culpable participant to make defendant eligible for organizer or leader enhancement). In addition, more than one person can qualify as an organizer or leader of a criminal conspiracy. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.1 cmt. n. 4; <em>United States v. Vallejo, </em>297 F.3d 1154, 1169 (11th Cir.2002) (\u201cThe defendant does not have to be the sole leader or kingpin of the conspiracy in order to be considered an organizer or leader within the meaning of the Guidelines\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b822-6\">Benavides argues the district court erred by applying the \u201corganizer or leader\u201d enhancement to him, claiming that it only applies when a defendant directly organized or led five or more persons. He supports this contention in two ways. First, he asserts the district court failed to find specifically that he organized or led five or more other culpable participants. Second, he points out that \u00a7 3Bl.l(b), the three level-enhancement found in \u00a7 3B1.1, has a different structure \u2014 a structure that does not require the defendant to have organized or lead five or more persons\u2014 than the four-level enhancement found in \u00a7 3Bl.l(a), which, by implication, requires the defendant to have directly led five or more people. Because of this structural difference, Benavides reasons, \u00a7 3Bl.l(b) should have applied and, thus, he should have received no more than the three-level enhancement found in subsection (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b822-10\">A district court may apply the four-level enhancement even if the defendant\u2019s criminal activity involved fewer than five people, so long as the defendant\u2019s participation was \u201cotherwise extensive.\u201d <em>United States v. Hall, </em>996 F.2d 284, 287 (11th Cir.1993). This answers Benavides\u2019 first contention. Yet he attempts to undermine the district court\u2019s decision by citing <em>United States v. Alred, </em>144 F.3d 1405 (11th Cir.1998), and by claiming that the \u201ccriminal activity\u201d the defendant organizes has a direct link to the number of participants in the scheme.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-11\">But Benavides misplaces his reliance on <em>Aired: </em>that case involved a drug dealer with extensive involvement as a <em>buyer and seller </em>of drugs, not as a <em>leader or organizer </em>of the enterprise. Benavides does not dispute that he had a leadership position over Ruiz. And this admission takes his case outside Aired\u2019s reach. The Commentary to the <em>Sentencing Guidelines, </em>moreover, flatly contradicts his claim that he had to organize or lead five or more people for subsection (a) to apply. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3Bl.l(a) cmt. n. 3 (\u201cIn assessing whether an organization is \u2018otherwise extensive,\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"795\">*795</page-number>all persons involved during the course of the entire offense are to be considered. Thus, a fraud that involved only three participants but used the unknowing services of many outsiders could be considered extensive.\u201d). Either way, the district court' correctly found that more than five people \u2014 Benavides, Guerra, Ruiz, Suleidy Cano, Abner Diaz, and \u201cthe lawyer,\u201d Benjamin Metsch \u2014 were involved with Lily.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-5\">Benavides\u2019 second argument hinges on the differences in grammatical structure between \u00a7\u00a7 3Bl.l(a) and (b). Together, the two subsections read as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b823-6\">Based on the defendant\u2019s role in the offense, increase the offense level as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b823-7\">(a) If the defendant was an organizer or leader of a criminal activity that involved five or more participants or was otherwise extensive, increase by 4 levels.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b823-8\">(b) If the defendant was a manager or supervisor (but not an organizer or leader) and the criminal activity involved five or more participants or was otherwise extensive, increase by 3 levels.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b823-9\">U.S.S.G. \u00a7\u00a7 3Bl.l(a), (b). Benavides claims that because the second hanging sentence uses the conjunction \u201cand\u201d to separate its first two clauses, the defendant need not have direct control over all five culpable participants for the enhancement to apply. Conversely, the first hanging sentence does not use \u201cand\u201d to separate its two clauses, which, according to Benavides, makes the numerosity requirement apply to both the criminal activity as a whole and to the phrase \u201corganizer or leader.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b823-12\">It is true enough the two sections use different phrasing. But while \u00a7 3Bl.l(b) uses \u201cand\u201d to separate its first two clauses, \u00a7 3Bl.l(a) achieves the same effect by using the relative pronoun \u201cthat.\u201d Indeed, the word \u201cthat\u201d stands in place of the noun immediately preceding it, which, in this case, is \u201cactivity.\u201d Applying this grammar and usage rule, the second clause in \u00a7 3Bl.l(a) only requires that the criminal activity involved five or more people. It does not, as Benavides claims, modify the entire \u201corganizer or leader\u201d clause to require direct authority over those other people.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Benavides\u2019 linguistic argument thus fails, and the district court\u2019s decision to apply the four-level enhancement is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-13\">V. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b823-14\">After his conviction, Yasmanny Benavides loosed a variety of claims of error and asserted that the district court improperly applied the \u201corganizer or leader\u201d enhancement to his sentence. As we have explained, the district court stayed within the bounds of its discretion and properly applied the disputed enhancement to Benavides\u2019 sentence. Accordingly, we AFFIRM both his conviction and sentence.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b813-10\">. The relevant statutes are 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1349 (Count 1), 1347 (Counts 2-4), and 1028A (Counts 5-7).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b813-16\">. The Government also introduced two additional charts that listed separately the total billings for Lacary and Lily by each doctor.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b815-10\">. Benavides also alleges the district court erred by holding, in the alternative, that it could admit the evidence for \"other purposes\" besides character. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Evid. 404(b). Because we find the district court properly admitted the Lacary evidence as inextricably intertwined with the charged offense, we need not reach this question.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b816-7\">. In <em>Bonner v. City of Prichard, </em>661 F.2d 1206, 1209 (11th Cir.1981) (en banc), the Eleventh Circuit adopted as binding precedent all Fifth Circuit decisions handed down prior to the close of business on September 30, 1981.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b817-7\">. In any event, even if we assume the district court erred, Benavides failed to brief whether such an error would amount to a reversible one.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b819-9\">. Although Judge Lenard invoked Rule 609 instead of Rule 404(b) for support, we may affirm a district court\u2019s decision on any ground supported by the record. <em>See, e.g., Trotter v. Dep\u2019t of Corrs., </em>535 F.3d 1286, 1291 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b820-6\">. It is also worth noting that the Government knew about Benavides\u2019 involvement in Lacary in 2004 \u2014 well within the limitations period\u2014 yet declined to prosecute him for it. That the Government knew of Benavides' involvement allowed the jury to infer the Government\u2019s failure to prosecute Benavides meant it did not have a solid case against him. This alternative inference (the Government did not have a case so it voluntarily decided not to prosecute) weakens the improper inference (Benavides got away with the Lacary fraud on a technicality), thus lessening, although not negating, \"the risk that [the] jury ... convicted] ... for crimes other than those charged.\u201d <em>Olinger v. Comm'r of Internal Revenue, </em>234 F.2d 823, 824 (5th Cir.1956).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b822-7\">.

To put it more simply, Benavides wants the court to read subsection (a) once and then again \u2014 the second time with an ellipses so as to require the defendant to be \"an organizer or leader of ... five or more participants\u201d before the district court can impose the four-level enhancement. As explained above, this would violate well-established grammatical and usage rules.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b823-15\">MARTIN, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"AiO\">Concurring:</p>\n<p id=\"b823-16\">Although I agree with the panel that Mr. Benavides\u2019s conviction is due to be affirmed, I write separately because I believe the district court judge erred in her application of Federal Rule of Evidence 609 to Mr. Benavides\u2019s questioning of Erich Ruiz.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"796\">*796</page-number>Having been called to testify by the government, Ruiz admitted that he had been arrested for participating in an illegal Internet pharmacy scheme. When counsel for Mr. Benavides sought to cross-examine Ruiz about a second set of charges stemming from the same incident, Ruiz claimed that those charges resulted only from his work for a pharmacist whose license had expired. The truth was far more serious, insofar as Ruiz had been charged with forging prescriptions and selling drugs without a prescription. Knowing this, Mr. Benavides\u2019s counsel followed up, asking, \u201c[w]ell, the first set of charges were [sic] selling drugs without a prescription. Right?\u201d The prosecutor objected to the question, citing Rule 609. And the district court limited Mr. Benavides\u2019s counsel \u201cto bring[ing] up the fact that [Ruiz] has a prior conviction.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b824-4\">The majority opinion affirms the district court on this issue, relying on an evidentiary rule that was not mentioned here or before the district court. The panel majority reads this exchange to \u201cf[all] outside the ambit of Rule 609,\u201d Op. 19, because it was not being introduced to attack Ruiz\u2019s <em>\u201ccharacter </em>for truthfulness.\u201d Fed.R.Evid. 609(a)(2) (emphasis added). Specifically, the majority says that Ruiz\u2019s prior conviction was not being used to impeach his \u201ccredibility by showing that he had committed a crime involving dishonesty, but instead to show that [another prosecution witness] had taught Ruiz how to commit fraud.\u201d Op. 18-19. Based on this, the panel opinion concludes that the prior conviction evidence was properly excluded under Rule 404(b), which would bar the evidence if it were being used to \u201cto prove [Ruiz\u2019s bad] <em>character,\u201d </em>Fed.R.Evid. 404(b)(1) (emphasis added). Op. 18.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-5\">This analysis is puzzling to me. If it is true that Ruiz\u2019s prior conviction evidence was being used to demonstrate a history of collaboration between Ruiz and \u201cthe Government\u2019s star witness against Benavides,\u201d Op. 2, then how, at the same time, is it correct to conclude that the evidence was rightly excluded because it was being used to prove Ruiz\u2019s character? Beyond that, I do not see how Rule 404(b) could apply, given that defense counsel brought up this fact during cross-examination of a prosecution witness. <em>See United States v. Morano, </em>697 F.2d 923, 926 (11th Cir.1983) (\u201cRule 404(b) does not specifically apply to exclude ... evidence [that] involves an extraneous offense committed by someone other than the defendant [because] the evidence was not introduced to show that the defendant has a criminal disposition ... so the policies underlying Rule 404(b) are inapplicable.\u201d); <em>see also United States v. Farmer, </em>923 F.2d 1557, 1567 (11th Cir.1991) (\u201cThe witness\u2019s motive to testify falsely is merely an aspect of credibility controlled by Fed.R.Evid. 608. Motive in the context of Rule 404(b) refers to the motive for the commission of the crime charged.\u201d) (quotations marks and alterations omitted) (quoting <em>United States v. Sampol, </em>636 F.2d 621, 659 n. 24 (D.C.Cir. 1980).)</p>\n<p id=\"b824-7\">I think what happened is that the district court misapplied Rule 609, limiting the cross-examination of Ruiz too strictly. Mr. Benavides\u2019s counsel asked Ruiz whether the charges brought against him had been for forging drug prescriptions, which is a crime involving dishonesty. Counsel presumably believed that the nature of that particular offense gave the jury an additional reason to question Ruiz\u2019s veracity, and thus to disbelieve his testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-8\">Plainly, Rule 609 <em>requires </em>the district court to admit the question raised by Mr. Benavides\u2019s counsel. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Evid. 609(a)(2) \u201c[E]vidence must be admitted\u201d where a prior crime involved \u201ca dishonest act or false statement.\u201d; <em>United States v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"797\">*797</page-number><em>Burston, </em>159 F.3d 1328, 1336 (11th Cir.1998) (holding that the district court abused its discretion by not admitting \u201cevidence of the nature and number of a non-defendant witness\u2019s prior felony convictions\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b825-5\">The district court was correct that there is some limit to how far counsel can delve into the underlying facts of a conviction under Rule 609. <em>Cf. United States v. Tumblin, </em>551 F.2d 1001, 1004 (5th Cir.1977) (holding that the prosecutor \u201cexceeded a reasonable scope of questioning\u201d when his inquiries began suggesting that the \u201cdefendant was a man who had spent most of his young life committing and serving time for crimes, rather than being gainfully employed\u201d).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> But, wherever that limit may fall, counsel for Mr. Benavides did not reach it here, simply by getting at the dishonest nature of the offense for which Ruiz had been convicted.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-6\">In drawing the Rule 609 line too soon, the district court prevented counsel from getting an answer to the basic question of whether Ruiz had been charged for the particular offense of forging prescriptions. In so doing, the district court deprived Mr. Benavides of a powerful basis for impeaching a critical witness against him. Thus, in my view, the district court abused its discretion when it construed Rule 609 to limit Mr. Benavides\u2019s cross-examination of Ruiz only to \u201cbring[ing] up the fact that [Ruiz] has a prior conviction.\u201d <em>See United States v. Frazier, </em>387 F.3d 1244, 1276 (11th Cir.2004) (stating that a \u201ctrial court abuses its discretion in making an evidentiary ruling if it misapplies the law.\u201d) (quotation marks omitted). Nevertheless, for the same reasons given in the panel\u2019s treatment of Mr. Benavides\u2019s prosecutorial misconduct claim, I find this error harmless.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b825-18\">.
