Claiming that as a result thereof he had, about the last of August, 1908, irrevocably lost the entire sight of both his eyes, he brought his suit against appellant and recovered the judgment for $1500, from which this appeal is prosecuted.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-4\"><em>(After stating the case as above.) </em>\u2014 The trial court did not err in overruling appellant\u2019s general demurrer to appellee\u2019s petition on the ground that it did not appear from the allegations therein that he had lost the entire sight of both his eyes through external, violent and accidental means alone and independently of all other causes. The allegations were that in unloading the rails \u201ca piece of iron or other hard substance was caused to fly and strike this plaintiff in his right eye; that by reason of such accident and injury this plaintiff has lost the entire sight of both eyes; that said accident and injury to plaintiff\u2019s right eye occurred on the 29th day of July, 1908; that immediately after said injury his right eye became inflamed and sore and continued in said condition for about two weeks,' at which time said inflamation and soreness was communicated from plaintiff\u2019s right eye to his left eye, from which time both eyes continued sore and inflamed until about the last of August, 1908, at which time and from said causes he entirely and irrevocably lost the sight of both eyes.\u201d We can not agree with appellant that the allegations quoted should be construed as relating \u201conly to the means by which appellee\u2019s right eye was injured.\u201d We think they should be construed as relating as well to the means by which his left eye was injured and its sight destroyed. The effect of the averments was to charge an accidental injury to the right eye resulting proximately in an injury to the left eye and destroying the sight of both. As against a general demurrer the allegations were sufficient. Travelers\u2019 Ins. Co. v. Hunter, 30 Texas Civ. App., 489, 70 S. W., 798.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-5\">Hor did the trial court err in overuling appellant\u2019s special exception to said petition on the ground that it did not \u201cset out and allege that plaintiff gave to the defendant insurance company such immediate written notice of the injury complained of as is required under and by the terms of the policy of insurance sued on herein.\u201d Appellant assumes that a failure to give such notice, by the terms of the policy operated to release it from liability. We have not been able to find such a stipulation in the policy. But such a stipulation, if in the policjq would be void, because inhibited by art. 3379, Sayles\u2019 Statutes, as amended in 1907 (see General Laws, p. 241), declaring that \u201cno stipulation in any contract requiring notice to be given of any claim for damages as a condition precedent to the right to sue thereon shall ever be valid unless such stipulation is reasonable, and any such stipulation fixing the time within which such notice shall be given at a less period than ninety days shall be void,\u201d etc.; and further declaring that \u201cin any suit brought under this . . . article it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>shall be presumed that notice has been given, unless the want of such notice is especially pleaded under oath.\u201d In Maryland Casualty Co. v. Hudgins, <em>72 </em>S. W., 1047, the statute was held to be applicable in a case like this one. On writ of error to the Supreme Court the judgment in the case cited was reversed, but on another ground and Avithout reference to the ruling of the Court of Civil Appeals in construing the statute referred to. See Maryland Casualty Co. v. Hudgins, 97 Texas, 124, 76 S. W., 745.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-3\">The trial Avas before the court without a jury. By its third and eighth assignments appellant complains that the finding of the court that appellee Avas irrevocably blind Avas without evidence to support it, and by its tenth assignment, grouped with the third and eighth, it' complains that the court\u2019s conclusion of law that appellee was entitled to recover as prayed for, was in face of his failure to find that appellee\u2019s loss of sight became irrevocable within ninety days after he suffered the injury to his right eye. As to the first complaint it is sufficient to say that appellee testified that in August, 1908, he had lost entirely the sight of both his eyes, and that at the time of the trial in March, 1909, he could not see at all Avith either of his eyes and to add that the record is wholly Avithout any evidence tending in the least to contradict him, or to show that his sight was not irrevocably lost. As to the other complaint, we state that the court specifically found, as is shown by the record before us, that appellee was injured as alleged in his right eye on July 29, 1908, and as a consequence of such injury that \u201cabout September 1, 1908, he lost the sight of both eyes, and is now and has been since said date totally blind, and is irrevocably blind in both eyes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b229-4\">By its fifth and ninth assignments appellant complains of the finding of the court that appellee lost the sight of both his eyes as the result alone of the injury to his right eye and not as a result of any kind of disease. The contention is that \u201cno evidence was offered and introduced at the trial\u201d to show that appellee\u2019s \u201closs of sight of both eyes resulted alone from the injury received by plaintiff in his right eye.\u201d Appellee testified, and his testimony was corroborated by other evidence in the record, that the injury to his right eye was caused by the piece of steel as stated; that his said eye at once after the injury became inflamed, and that in about two weeks his left eye, Avithout any cause therefor other than the condition of his right eye, became affected. Dr. Ferrell, testifying as an expert, stated that it often happened that when one eye is injured the other through sympathy will be affected, and appellant\u2019s witness, Dr. BaldAvin, testified that one eye might through sympathy become involved after the other was injured. Obviously, Ave think it must be said, in view of the testimony .referred to, the contention made that there was no eA'idence offered to show that appellee lost the sight of both his eyes as the result of the accidental injury as charged to one of them, should not be sustained. The assignments specified therefore are overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-5\">The remaining assignment attacks the court\u2019s conclusion of law that appellee should recover of appellant the sum sued for, on the ground that the court did not find as a fact that appellee had ir<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>revocably lost the sight of both his eyes \u201cby accidental means independently of all other causes.\u201d But the court, as is shown by the record, did so find as a fact. We quote from his findings: \u201cWhile plaintiff was unloading steel rails . . . some particle flew up and struck plaintiff in the right eye; that said eye became inflamed at once, and the left eye became affected from the inflammation in the right eye; . . . and about September 1, 1908, he lost the sight of both eyes, and is now and has been since said date totally blind, and is irrevocably blind in both eyes; that a scar is visible on the ball of plaintiff\u2019s right eye; that said loss of sight resulted alone from the injury received in his right eye and not from disease of any kind.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b230-4\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-5\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b230-6\">Writ of error refused.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
