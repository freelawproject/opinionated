Opposition was offered by the Smiths to the appointment of a receiver. However, the court below granted the motion and designated a receiver to handle the property. The Smiths thereupon prosecuted this appeal from the order.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-6\">Pending the disposition of the present appeal there has been brought to this court for review the decree thereafter entered in the divorce action (L. A. No. 14019) and the decrees entered in two other actions (L. A. No. 13834 and L. A. No. 14257) wherein the appellants Smith sought to have their interests in the property declared and their rights adjudicated. The decree entered in the divorce action was affirmed by this court in April, 1935, and the <em>remittitur </em>has gone down. <em>(Mayo </em>v. <em>Mayo, </em>3 Cal. (2d) 51 [43 Pac. (2d) 535].) Upon stipulation of the parties, the appeals in the last two mentioned cases were dismissed and the <em>remittiturs </em>duly issued.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-7\">It necessarily follows that the issues involved in this appeal have become moot. In 22 California Jurisprudence, page 476, section 61, it is stated that \u201ca receivership <em>pendente lite </em>terminates with the rendition of judgment; thereafter any questions as to the propriety of an appointment are moot, and will not be reviewed\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-8\">The appeal is dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
