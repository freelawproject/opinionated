To make colors for their carpets. Q. Was that the whole of your arrangement? A. Yes; but they said that as they were just commencing business, and if the business continued that they would gradually increase my salary. Q. Did they do it subsequently? A. Yes, sir. Q. During the time of your employment with them? A. Yes, sir. Q. To what was it increased? A. To $2,260 per annum. Q. Was that the amount you received when your employment terminated? A. Yes, sir.

Dobson to mix colors for them and make experiments in their mill and on their time, and when he was paid by them for his labor, that the result reached by him was theirs as well -as his; and, -it seems to me, that is based on such a plain principle of common sense, that it must be right; that when a color <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>mixer produces one hundred and thirty shades to go into a carpet, as it has been testified here has been frequently the case, and it becomes a standard pattern, and does this work on their time and at their expense, that then, if he leaves their employ, it naturally follows that his former employers will want to match these shades, and, therefore, they should have the formula by which they were made. The Supreme Court has settled that question, however; they have settled that these books or recipes contained in these books belonged to the Messrs. Dobson, while the plaintiff had a right to make a memorandum or keep copies or jot down in any way for his further use, such recipes; but, by reason of the employment, they were not his exclusive property. So when he was leaving he was taking with him certain pieces of paper or books containing certain recipes that belonged to the Messrs. Dobson; and when they said: \u201c You cannot take these books away, but you can go home and leave them here,\u2019\" they did not do anything more than the Supremo Court has said they had a right to do. It was no more his right to have an absolute control over them than it was theirs. There does not appear to have been any violence done. He could have gone home at any time during these four hours, during which he stayed in the mill. If they had kept these books for any unreasonable time, and he was obliged for that reason to give up other employment,\u2014if he could prove that,\u2014that might form a basis upon which a jury might award damages; but they did not do that; they only kept these books twenty-seven days until they could make copies of them, and there has been nothing to show that he was damaged by that or on which he could be given damages; and, therefore, I direct you to find a -verdict in this case for the defendants.] [4, 5]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b611-5\">Verdict and judgment for defendants.

Justice Williams,</author>\n<p id=\"b612-8\">This case was in this Court in 1896, and is reported in 174, Pa. 122. A verdict and judgment had been obtained in the court below against-the defendants from which they appealed. We reversed the judgment, holding that a color mixer could not assert as against his employer, an exclusive title to the various combinations and shades of color devised by him for use in the manufacture of carpets in his employers\u2019 mill. But we awarded a venire facias de novo because of an allegation that violence had been used by the defendants in the detention of the plaintiff, and in preventing him from carrying away from the mill his color books. A new trial has now been had. The charges of the use of unlawful violence do not seem to have been pressed, but the plaintiff attempted on the trial to prove a custom or usage prevailing in the business of carpet making, by which the results of the color mixer\u2019s skill and labor in the service of his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>employer Is recognized as belonging exclusively to tire employee, the color mixer; the employer, the manufacturer, for whoso use the colors were devised having no title whatever to them. The several assignments of error relate to the rejection of the evidence offered to establish such a custom. It is one of the requisites of a good custom that it must be reasonable. Another is, that it must not be contrary to law. The custom sought to be set up was an unreasonable one. The color mixer, like the designer and the weaver, is employed because of his supposed ability to serve his employer in the particular line of labor which he is expected to follow. First comes the work of the designer, who prepares, or invents, it may be, the pattern after which the carpet is to be made. Then comes the color mixer who is to mix his employers\u2019 colors, in such proportions as to produce the necessary shades required by the pattern that has been adopted. Finally comes the application of the colors and the weaving. The services of each and all these mechanics are requisite to the production of the carpet. The employer has an equal right to the faithful service of each, and is equally, so far as his own business is concerned, entitled to the results of the labor of each. If a color mixer could at his pleasure carry off the recipes and color books from his employers\u2019 factory and refuse to permit their further use except upon his own terms, it would be in his power to inflict enormous loss on the manufacturer at any moment, and not merely to disturb, but to destroy his business. Such a custom would not be reasonable and could not be sustained. But it is against the law. The courts of the United States, of this state and, so far as I have been able to examine, of all the states in the Union, recognize the rule laid down when this case was here in 1896, that \u2018\u2018 The designs and recipes so made for an employer are as between his employee and himself, his, for the purpose of his own manufacturing business. Even if his employee had obtained letters patent for his formula, protecting himself thereby against the public, still the employers\u2019 right to continue its use in his own business would be protected by the United States courts : \u201d Solomons v. United States, 137 U. S. Peps. 342. To the same effect are Slemmer\u2019s Appeal, 58 Pa. 155; Dempsey v. Dobson, 174 Pa. 122. The several offers made for the purpose of showing the existence of the alleged customs were properly rejected. In the absence of proof of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>alleged acts of violence, we fully concur with the learned judge of the court below that there was nothing shown by the evidence on the part of the plaintiff sufficient to sustain a verdict against the defendants, and that the case was a proper one for a compulsory nonsuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-5\">The judgment is affirmed, and judgment is now entered in favor of the defendants.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
