Robinson as trustee and executor instead of said David Robinson, deceased.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b332-4\">William A. Robinson, as surviving executor, filed this account and by writing filed, made the following distribution of the residue of the estate:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b332-5\">\u201cTo the Home for Aged Protestant Women, at Wilkins-burg, Penna., five hundred dollars. To the Passavant Memorial Home for Epileptics, Rochester, Penna., five hundred dollars. To the trustees of Washington and Jefferson College at Washington, Penna., for permanent funds, one thousand dollars. To the Trustees of the Western Theological Seminary of the Presbyterian Church in Allegheny, Penna., in aid of fund for establishing a chair of Sacred Rhetoric and Elocution, one thousand dollars. The balance of the said estate to be divided into four equal parts : One of said parts to be given to each of the following institutions, namely: To the Homeopathic Medical and Surgical Hospital and Dispensary of Pittsburg, Penna., for permanent funds, one of said four parts ; to the Allegheny General Hospital in Allegheny, Penna., for permanent funds, one of said four parts; to the Trustees of Washington and Jefferson College at Washington, Penna., for permanent funds, one of said four parts, and to the Presbyterian Hospital of Pittsburg and Allegheny, Penna., for permanent funds, one of said four parts.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b332-6\">It is claimed by the next of kin (1) that the bequest in the residuary clause is void for uncertainty; (2) that the surviving executor had not the power alone to designate the beneficiaries ; (3) that the lapsed legacy to testator\u2019s wife did not fall into the residue.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b332-7\">In Missionary Society\u2019s Appeal, 30 Pa. 425, it was said that \u201c In the case of a will making a charitable bequest, it is immaterial how vague, indefinite and uncertain the objects of the testator\u2019s bounty may be, provided there is a discretionary power vested in someone over its application to-those objects.\u201d Such discretionary power here is vested in the executors; but it is contended upon the authority of Morice v. Bishop of Durham, 9 Yes. 399, where the bequest was for such objects of benevolence and liberality as the trustee in his discretion should most approve, and other English cases that, as the bequest here <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>is for benevolent as well as charitable uses, it is void for uncertainty. In Witman v. Lex, 17 S. &amp; R. 88, Gibson, C. J., in commenting upon Morico v. Bishop of Durham, said that such a gift would probably be uphold in <em>Pennsylvania; </em>but there have been no cases cited of our Supreme Court directly in point; there are, however, from other states. In Sal tons tall v. Sanders, 11 Allen, 4,46, Mr. Justice Gray sustained a trust \u201cfor the furtherance and promotion of good morals, and in aiding objects and purposes of benevolence and charity.\u201d On page 468 he said, \u201cThe decisions of the English courts since our revolution are of no binding authority on this Court, and upon such a question as the interpretation of the word \u2018 benevolence,\u2019 as connected with \u2018 charity,\u2019 of no particular weight when opposed to the well settled meaning of the words in our own law.\u201d And on page 470, \u201cWhatever therefore may be the meaning in the law of Massachusetts of the word \u2018 benevolence \u2019 by itself there can be no doubt that when used in connection with \u2018 charity \u2019 it is synonymous with it.\u201d A still stronger case is Rotcli v. Emerson, 105 Mass. 431, where a gift to trustees \u201cto be by them applied for the promotion of agricultural or horticultural improvements or other philosophical or philanthropical purposes at their discretion\u201d was sustained as a charitable bequest. In Goodale v. Mooney, 60 57. H. 528, the following bequest was sustained: \u201c I place the remainder of my property in the hands of my executors to be distributed by them after my decease, among my relatives and for benevolent objects.\u201d On page 534 the Court said: \u201c In many cases the word \u2018 benevolent \u2019 has been coupled with \u2018 charitable \u2019 or some equivalent word, or has been mentioned in connection with such public institutions as to show an intent to make it synonymous with charity.\u201d They are also synonymous in their ordinary meaning. See Webster\u2019s Dictionary.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b333-5\">It seems then that the word \u201c benevolent \u201d as used, by the testator, is to be construed as synonymous with \u201c charitable,\u201d and the residuary bequest is therefore not void for uncertainty. But it is contended that Wm. Robinson, as the sole surviving executor, had. not the flower to designate the beneficiaries under the residuary clause. If the power were incident to the persons of the executors and not to the office, this position would, perhaps, be well taken. The testator provided that the seleo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>tion of the beneficiaries should be made \u201c by my executors or their successors.\u201d The distribution of the residuary estate was not to be made until after tbe death of his wife; and it is not probable he anticipated that the beneficiaries would be designated until then, and his wife, as executrix, would not therefore take part. The word \u201csuccessors \u201d appears to indicate that he intended the power of selection should be exercised by the persons filling the office after his wife\u2019s decease; and the power seems to be annexed to the office, and not to the person. \u25a0 In Perry on Trusts, sec. 499, it is said, \u201cThe question is whether the donor reposed a personal trust and confidence in the trustees appointed, or whether he reposed the power in whomsoever might in fact fill the office of trustee.\u201d And in Hill on Trustees, 489, \u201c Where the power is annexed to the office of trustees aiid one or more of the trustees refuse to accept the trust, it is settled that those who accept may exercise the power.\u201d We think the surviving executor had power to designate the beneficiaries, and as they are all charitable to some extent, his designation is valid and distribution must be made accordingly.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b334-5\">The legacy to his wife was given to her absolutely, coupled with a suggestion that under certain contingencies she should give the Pennsylvania railroad stock to certain persons. The words are merely precatory, created no trust, and did not in any way qualify the absolute gift to her. The legacy lapsed by reason of her death before the testator, and as the will contains a general residuary clause, and it is evident it was the intention of the testator to dispose of his whole estate, the lapsed legacy falls into the residue, and must be distributed as part of it to the beneficiaries designated by the executor: Gray\u2019s Appeal, 147 Pa. 67; Powell\u2019s Appeal, 138 Pa. 322; Reimer\u2019s Estate, 159 Pa. 212.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b334-6\">The court entered the following decree:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b334-7\">And now, to wit: Sept. 2,1897, this matter came on for hearing, audit and distribution, at this term, ^.nd testimony taken, and thereupon, upon consideration thereof, it is ordered, adjudged and decreed that the fund and securities in hands of accountant, viz., $44,201.14, be paid in! accordance with the schedule of distribution hereto attached and made part hereof, unless an appeal be taken hereafter within twenty days.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b334-8\">Exceptions filed by the next of kin, which appear by the assignments of error, were dismissed by the court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AIJ\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number><em>Errors assigned </em>were (1) In entering the decree of September 2,1897. (2) In dismissing appellants\u2019 first exception to the decree of September 2, 1897, which exception was as follows : \u201c1. The learned court erred in holding as valid the following portion of the sixth clause of the third paragraph of the will of decedent, to wit: \u2018 The balance of my estate, after the payment of the above legacies and collateral inheritance tax on them, to be divided among such benevolent, charitable and religious institutions and associations as shall be selected by my executors, or their successors.\u2019 The learned court should have held the said clause void for uncertainty.\u201d (3) In dismissing appellants\u2019 second exception, which was as follows: \u201c 2. The learned court erred in not holding that the power of appointment vested in the executors or their successors is under the above clause incapable of exercise by the surviving executor alone.\u201d (4) In dismissing the appellants\u2019 third exception, which was as follows: \u201c 3. The learned court erred in holding that the lapsed legacies and devises to Mrs. Matilda T. Murphy are to be distributed under the residuary clause.\u201d (5) In dismissing the appellants\u2019 fourth exception which was as follows: \u201c 4. The learned court erred in holding that the 150 shares of Pennsylvania Railroad Company stock bequeathed to Mrs. Matilda T.

Kurtz in trust as set forth in the second paragraph of decedent\u2019s will.\u201d (6) In dismissing the appellants\u2019 fifth exception, which was as follows: \u201c 5. The learned court erred in decreeing distribution of the residue of decedent\u2019s estate in accordance with the writing filed by Win. A.
