J., found the facts to be as follows :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b338-13\">On August 1, 1891, William Loeffler, the defendant, entered of record in the prothonotary\u2019s office of this county, at No. 84, October term, 1891, D. S. B., a judgment note against William E. Schmertz, for the sum of $100,000. On August 7, 1891, execution was issued on this judgment, and a large amount of the personal property of Schmertz was levied upon and sold, the amount realized therefrom being something over $65,000. At the time Schmertz gave the judgment to Loeffler, he, Schmertz, was insolvent, and on August 7, 1891, the day upon which the execution Avas issued on Loeffler\u2019s judgment, other judgments were entered up against Schmertz, and subsequently executions issued upon them. Schmerbz\u2019s life was insured for a large amount, and at the time of the delivery of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>judgment note to Loeffler, Schmertz assigned tp Loeffler, as security for his indebtedness, two policies for the sum of $25,000 each, in the Mutual Life Insurance Company of New York. Schmertz lived until July 13, 1893, and from the date of the assignment of these policies until Sehmertz\u2019s death, Loeffler kept them alive and paid in premiums therefor out of his own funds the sum of $7,347.80.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b339-5\">Schmertz\u2019s indebtedness to Loeffler on August 1, 1891, amounting to $179,900, was composed of the following items:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b339-6\">(1) Loeffler had indorsed for Schmertz and discounted for him to the total amount of $53,650 ; (2) Loeffler had loaned to Schmertz 250 shares of the capital stock of Standard Plate Glass Company, which at the time of the loan was worth $100 to $105 per share, or $25,000; (3) Schmertz had been appointed guardian of the minor children of 11. E. Schmertz, and Loeffler was surety upon several bonds for said Schmertz as guardian, amounting altogether to the sum of $101,250. After the failure of Schmertz, the Safe Deposit and Trust Company was appointed guardian of these minor children, and the liability of the sureties upon Schmertz\u2019s bonds was liquidated and fixed at $22,000, of which Loeffler\u2019s proportion was $10,243.09, which sum was paid by Loeffler to the Safe Deposit and Trust Company, the guardian. So the total indebtedness of Schmertz was as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b339-7\">Indorsements ...... $53,650 00</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b339-8\">250 Shares Plate Glass Stock . . . 25,000 00</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b339-9\">Liability paid on Schmertz\u2019s bonds as guardian ....... 10,243 09</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b339-10\">Premiums paid on Insurance Policies held as collateral...... 7,374 80</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b339-12\">Interest on various accounts . . . 3,609 50</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b339-13\">$99,877 89</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b339-14\">When Schmertz died in July, 1893, the original bill in this case was filed, and before the proceeds of the two policies of insurance upon Schmertz\u2019s life were paid to Loeffler, two agreements were executed, which provide that the proceeds of the two policies, amounting to $81,189.52 should be paid to Loeffler, and that Loeffler should retain in his hands the sum of $7,347.80, which sum he had expended in keeping the policies <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>alive, and the further sum of $25,000 which he claimed was due him on account of 250 shares of the stock of the Standard Plate Glass Company, which said Schmertz borrowed from said Loeffler, and lost the same by sale thereof under said pledge, which claim of said Loeffler as to its validity or amount is disputed by the assignee of W. E. Schmertz. And it is the sum of $25,000 now in the hands of the defendant Loeffler, that is the matter of dispute.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b340-5\">Loeffler, after retaining the amounts agreed upon, paid over the balance, $32,374.80 to the assignee.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b340-6\">Prior to the failure of Schmertz, Loeffler loaned him 250 shares of the Standard Plate Glass Company, worth from $100 to $105 per share, and afterwards\u2014also prior to his (Schmertz\u2019s) failure\u2014Loeffler demanded a return of his stock, which was refused; nor was Loeffler ever tendered the stock.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b340-7\">After Loeffler\u2019s judgment was entered and execution issued upon it, and levy made on personal property, Schmertz\u2019s real estate was levied upon by the judgment creditors immediately behind Loeffler, and, at the distribution before the auditor, Loeffler made no claim on the lien of his judgment, and did not share in the distribution.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b340-8\">Loeffler\u2019s judgment was $100,000, and the indebtedness on said note was as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b340-10\">Indorsements ...... $53,650 00</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b340-11\">250 shares Standard Plate Glass stock . . 25,000 00</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b340-12\">Paid Guardian on Schmertz bond . . 10,243 09</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b340-13\">Premiums paid on policies held as collateral . 7,374 80</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b340-14\">Interest on these various amounts . . 3,609 50</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b340-15\">Net indebtedness .... $99,877 39</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b340-16\">On account of this indebtedness Loeffler has received the following sums:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b340-17\">December 19, 1891, on his execution on personal property, in court No. 2 . . $53,650 00</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b340-18\">February 18, 1893, on his execution in same case, by decree of court, \u201c That the said balance remaining in registry of the court, realized upon the execution aforesaid, be Amount carried forward, $53,650 00</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b341-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>Amount brought forward, $53,650 00</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"A6C\">forthwith paid over to plaintiff, on account of the judgment held by him and upon which said execution was issued,\u201d and which we find the plaintiff had the right to apply to his judgment . 12,276 49</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b341-5\">Proceeds of policies now in his hands, on account of loan of 250 shares of Standard Plate Glass Company, which we find he is entitled to ..... 25,000 00</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b341-6\">Return of premiums paid to keep the policies alive....... 7,374 80</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b341-7\">Total amount received $98,30129</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b341-12\">Balance still due on Loeffler\u2019s judgment: $1,576.10.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b341-13\">CONCLUSIONS OP LAW.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b341-14\">It is contended by the learned counsel for plaintiff that Loeffler was bound to present his claim to the auditor for distribution out of the funds realized on the sale of the real estate of Schmertz, he having the first lien, and having neglected to do this he cannot now retain the $25,000 in his hands.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b341-15\">We do not agree with him in this. We think Loeffler had a right to rely on the collateral that he held, and was not bound to present his claim before the auditor. The recovery of judgment upon the principal debt does not affect the pledgee\u2019s right to hold and enforce the pledge taken to secure that debt. It is the very nature of collateral security that it may be resorted to for a satisfaction of the principal debt, if its payment shall not otherwise be obtained: Jones on Pledges, sec. 591.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b341-16\">Again it is contended that the offer of Mr. McCook, for the assignee of Mr. Schmertz, to return the stock, at a time that it had depreciated to less than one half its value, which was refused by Mr. Loeffler, was equivalent to a tender. Mr. Loeffler had, before the failure of Mr. Schmertz, demanded a return of his stock, and had been refused, and we think he was not bound to accept an offer to get the stock, and to accept it at its depreciation. It was in no sense a legal tender.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b341-17\">Having found that the defendant is entitled to retain the $25,000 in dispute, and that after giving all credits of money <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>received on his judgment it is not yet paid in full, the bill is dismissed at costs of the plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b342-4\"><em>Error assigned </em>was decree dismissing bill.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b342-5\"><em>Albert York Smith, </em>with him <em>Joseph A.

Quiby, the son-in-law, to proceed upon the real estate and come in for a large part of their claims, although they were subsequent to his judgment, and he, Leoffler, made no attempt to participate in this fund.

Chief Justice Sterrktt,</author>\n<p id=\"b343-7\">The genera] subject of contention presented by the amended bill, etc., in this case, is whether the defendant, William Loeffler, is entitled to retain twenty-five thousand ($25,000) dollars on account of the two hundred and fifty shares of Standard Plate Glass Company stock loaned by him to William E. Schmertz and not returned. The court below held that he was, and accordingly dismissed the bill at plaintiff\u2019s costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-8\">The decree might well be affirmed on the learned trial judge\u2019s concise and accurate findings of the controlling facts, in connection with the conclusions briefly but correctly drawn by him therefrom; but, it may not be amiss to notice some of the questions involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-9\">The sum above stated is in defendant Loeffler\u2019s hands, retained by him out of the proceeds of life insurance policies assigned to him by W. E. Schmertz (since deceased), as collateral security against sundry liabilities for and on account of said assignor, including the Plate Glass stock in controversy. The residue of the insurance money was paid over by Loeffler to the use plaintiff, for the benefit of the creditors. It follows therefore that if Loeffler is entitled to the $25,000, the bill was rightly dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-10\">In its printed argument, the use plaintiff states that \u201cthe testimony on the part of the plaintiff is that a tender of the stock in question (same amount and kind) was made by ... . the original assignee of Schmertz, .... and that Loeffler refused to accept it.\u201d The testimony of Mr. McCook, one of the assignees referred to, further shows that the stock, at the time <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>he offered to return it, had depreciated in value so that it was not worth more than fifty cents on the dollar. It is true, the same witness also testified that defendant Loeffler, \u201c had not to my knowledge and according to my information ever demanded a return of that stock from Mr. Schmertz until after the failure, and that the stock immediately on his failure fell to as low a point as it was then.\u201d But Loeffler testified that he had made a demand for the return of the stock before Schmertz\u2019s failure, and that it was refused. The court specially finds this fact. While tins finding of fact is embraced in the second assignment, the conclusions of law alone are specified as errors. But even if treated as covered by this assignment, the finding of the court could not be reversed, because in that respect Loeffler\u2019s testimony was not contradicted by that of McCook.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-5\">Unless there is something else in the case, the decree under the authorities was right. In Huntingdon, etc., Railroad v. English, 86 Pa. 253, it was said: \u201c The rights of the parties were definitively fixed when the breach occurred.\u201d In Musgrave v. Beckendorff, 53 Pa. 310, it was held that the measure of damages for the breach of a contract to replace borrowed stock is the highest price it had reached between the breach and the trial. In the present case the highest price was the ruling price at the time of the demand and refusal.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-6\">It is contended, however, by the beneficial plaintiff that there are other facts in the case which will preclude Loeffler from paying himself out of this fund. Briefly stated, these facts are, that defendant held Schmertz\u2019s bond for $100,000, as security for the same debts that are covered by the assignment of life insurance policies. The judgment on this bond was a first lien on Schmertz\u2019s real estate. Subsequent to that were two other judgments upon which executions were issued and the land sold. Before the auditor charged with distribution of the fund thus raised, no claim was made by Loeffler, and no part of the fund was awarded to his judgment; and it is contended that he thereby forfeited his right to payment out of the insurance fund. On that question the learned trial judge rightly refused to sustain the use plaintiff\u2019s contention, and his ruling is not specifically assigned as error. But if it were, it is sufficiently vindicated in the opinion of the court below. In addition to the authority there cited may be added Ayres v. Wattson, 57 Pa. 360, to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>effect that a creditor may hold an unlimited number of collaterals and avail himself of any of them as long as the debt remains unpaid. \u201cA person may if he chooses relinquish a collateral security altogether\u2019, without the consent of other creditors of his debtor. It is a matter resting entirely between him and his debtor with which others have nothing to do: \u201d Dyott\u2019s Est., 2 W. &amp; S. 490.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-4\">It was further contended that as Loeffler had a prior hold on two funds he should have resorted to the other, leaving this one intact for the payment of general creditors. But the junior lien creditors might with propriety have urged the same considerations in relation to the realty fund. If the defendant had participated in that fund the junior lien creditors might have asked to be subrogated to his rights in the present fund : Ramsey\u2019s App., 2 Watts, 228; Mason\u2019s App., 89 Pa. 402; Tubbs\u2019s Est., 161 Pa. 252; Addams v. Heffernan, 9 Watts, 512.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-5\">Inasmuch as defendant\u2019s debt is not yet paid in full, it is not necessary to consider the allowance on account of the amount-claimed to have been appropriated from the proceeds of the sale of personal property to the claim here in controversy. By the decree of court in those proceedings, it was ordered to be paid over on account of \u201c defendant\u2019s judgment,\u201d and it has been here properly treated as so paid.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-6\">In any view that can be reasonably taken of the case, the result in the court below was substantially correct, and the decree should be sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-7\">Decree affirmed and appeal dismissed at appellant\u2019s costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
