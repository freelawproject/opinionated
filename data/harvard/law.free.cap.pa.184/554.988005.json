Gilbert, who was. the owner thereof, the certificate of stock in suit, with a blank <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>power of attorney attached thereto, said power being executed by Mrs. Gilbert and witnessed by her husband, E. D. Gilbert,which certificate and power of attorney McDonald delivered to Laughlin &amp; McManus as security for his note. On September 22, 1892, while the loan to McDonald was still in continuance and unsettled, Laughlin &amp; McManus borrowed Cor their own use from the Erie Building Association the sum of |5,000, and as security therefor delivered to the association the said certificate of stock and power of attorney, first adding to said-power of attorney under the signature of Mrs. Gilbert, the words-\u201csignature guaranteed, Laughlin &amp; McManus\u201d together with twenty shares of stock of the Tradesmen\u2019s National Bank. The stock in question was never transferred from Mrs. Gilbert on the books of the Gatawissa Railroad Company, and the representatives of the Building Association made no inquiry as to its ownership.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b575-5\">The following is a copy of said power of attorney:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b575-6\">\u201cKnow all men by these presents, That I, Clara A. Lukens,. for value received, have bargained, sold, assigned and transferred, and by these presents do grant, bargain, sell, assign and transfer unto Fifty (50) shares of the Capital Stock of The Catawissa R.

D. Gilbert.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b576-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>On April 17, 1893, Mrs. Gilbert notified the Catawissa Railroad Company of her claim to the said stock, and on February 4, 1895, and February 6,1895, the Erie Building Association notified the Railroad Company of its claim thereto, whereupon the Railroad Company filed a bill in equity, out of which the feigned issue arose.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b576-5\">The court gave binding instructions for defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b576-6\">Verdict and judgment for defendant. Plaintiff appealed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b576-7\"><em>Error assigned </em>was in giving binding instructions for defendant. \u25a0</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b576-8\"><em>Elias P. </em>Smithers, with him <em>Samuel S. Craig, </em>for appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AeR\">It is submitted that in the present case the fact that the power \u2022of attorney was to sell and not to pledge was sufficient to have \u2022caused the defendant to have inquired as to the ownership of \u2022the stock: Wood\u2019s App., 92 Pa. 379; Ryman v. Gerlach, 153 Pa. 205; Leiper\u2019s App., 108 Pa. 377.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b576-9\">It is well settled in this state that a power to sell does not include a power to pledge; that letters of attorney are to be .strictly interpreted, and the authority is never to be extended beyond that which is given in terms. A person who deals with .an agent acting under a power of attorney deals at his peril if the authority is exceeded: Strohecker v. Farmers\u2019 Bank, 6 Watts, 99; Heffernan v. Addams, 7 Watts, 120; Devinney v. Reynolds, 1 W. &amp; S. 333; Baring v. Peirce, 5 W. &amp; S. 551; Campbell v. Foster Home Assn., 163 Pa. 632.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b576-10\">Another circumstance that should have put the officer of the building association upon inquiry is that Laughlin &amp; McManus put upon the power of attorney under Mrs. Gilbert\u2019s name the words \u201c signature guaranteed, Laughlin &amp; McManus.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b576-11\">Again, Laughlin &amp; McManus, who were brokers, in borrowing from defendants, a building association, were acting out of the usual course of their business: Burton\u2019s App., 93 Pa. 214.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b576-12\"><em>E. Hunn Hanson, </em>with him <em>C. T. Quin, </em>for appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A6B\">A certificate of stock accompanied by a power of attorney to transfer is in the hands of the holder presumptive evidence of ownership-\u2014an ownership in nowise differing from the real and actual one, and therefore justifying, not only a sale, but any lesser dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>position, by one who is a bona fide h older for value, and without notice of an interfering equity: Holbrook v. N. J. Zinc Co., 57 N. Y. 616; Prall v. Tilt, 28 N. J. Eq. 479; Wood\u2019s App., 92 Pa. 379.</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"A8N\">February 7, 1898:</decisiondate>\n<opinion data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b577-4\">Pee Curiam,</author>\n<p id=\"b577-5\">The power of attorney on the back of the certificate signed by the plaintiff was in the usual general terms of such instruments, and contained no restrictions, qualifications or conditions. It contained a full power of sale, and certainly authorized a sale of the certificate by any attorney who had it in his lawful custody. The defendant was an innocent pledgee of the certificate, and was perfectly at liberty to advance money upon it, and take it as collateral, divested of all claims on the part of the owner. Under all the authorities a transfer executed in such circumstances confers a good title upon the person buying it or advancing money upon it.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-6\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
