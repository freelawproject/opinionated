Long at the time was engaged in large scale construction of low cost housing in Puerto Rico. The employment contract was reduced to writing December 29, 1947.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> It contained, under the caption \u201cTerm of Employment\u201d the following clause:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b333-5\">\u201cThis agreement shall remain in force so long as Long Construction Company of Puerto Rico is engaged in the construction of homes for Everlasting Development Corporation of Puerto Rico; <em>subject, of course, to the right of L. D. Long [president of Long~\\ in his sole discretion, to terminate the same for any act or omission deemed by him to be detrimental to the good and welfare of said business.\u201d </em>(Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b333-6\">On the afternoon of December 24, 1947, the office employees of Long held a Christmas party. Long was not present. He was at that time in Charleston, South Carolina, visiting his parents for the Christmas holiday. Johnson, who was at the party, \u201cwas considerably in liquor, and at one point came up to Frederick D\u2019 A. Carpenter, at that time Territorial Director of the Federal Housing Administration and told him that Long, President of the defendant corporation, was an \u2018S.O.B.\u2019 and that Long did not know what he was doing.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On still another occasion, at the same party, Johnson had an altercation with a fellow employee in the course of which he said \u201ceveryone there was a bastard; and that the organization was full of crap, that the people present were sons of bitches\u201d.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Prior to this episode Johnson \u201chad pinched the buttocks\u201d <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> of the wife of the man with whom he had the altercation.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-13\">Subsequent to this Christmas party, on December 27, 1947, Johnson wrote a letter to one Nutter, a prospective employee of Long, \u201cwhich although jocular in tone reflected on the concept of morality prevailing in the defendant organization\u201d.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b333-14\">On December 27th Johnson left Puerto Rico for Charleston, South Carolina, to confer with Long on company business. It was on that visit that the written contract was signed. Subsequently Johnson left for New York and Chicago on company business. Long on his return to Puerto Rico on January 5, 1948, learned of the Christmas party episode and instituted an investigation of Johnson\u2019s conduct. As a result of the investigation \u201cMr. Long' decided that plaintiff\u2019s (Johnson\u2019s) actions were detrimental to the best interests of the company, and discharged him by cablegram on January 7, 1948.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b333-15\">On the findings stated the District Court concluded as a matter of law that Long \u201chad adequate grounds in law for discharging\u201d Johnson and entered judgment dismissing Johnson\u2019s action.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-16\">Johnson advances two contentions on this appeal: (1) while his conduct at the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>Christmas party \u201cmight not be considered exemplary\u201d it nevertheless was not \u201cdetrimental to the good and welfare of the business\u201d; (2) in any event, the conduct which led to his dismissal occurred prior to the signing of the contract of December 29th and therefore could not as a matter of law provide the basis of dismissal under its terms.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-4\">In reply, Long disputes these contentions and urges further that under the express terms of the contract the right to terminate Johnson\u2019s employment was left to Long\u2019s <em>sole discretion </em>and accordingly he could do so upon the occurrence of any act or omission which <em>he </em>might deem detrimental to his business. Otherwise stated, it is Long\u2019s view that the contract made him the \u201cexclusive judge\u201d as to what constituted an act or omission \u201cdetrimental to the good and welfare\u201d of his business, and the only requirement was that he act in good faith.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-5\">It is unnecessary to consider this latter proposition because in our opinion Johnson\u2019s contentions are without merit and the record affords substantial basis for the District Court\u2019s determination that \u201cDefendant (Long) had adequate grounds in law for discharging plaintiff (Johnson).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b334-6\">Putting aside Johnson\u2019s rowdy conduct. at the Christmas party, his drunkenness, his altercation with a fellow employee and the pinching incident, his statement to Carpenter, the Territorial Director of the Federal Housing Administration that Long \u201cwas an S.O.B.\u201d and that \u201cLong did not know what he was doing\u201d and his further statement to all and sundry at the party that Long\u2019s \u201corganization was full of crap\u201d constituted conduct \u201cdetrimental to the good and welfare\u201d of Long\u2019s business. If more were needed, Johnson\u2019s letter to Nutter, could well be considered a \u201csecond-helping\u201d on that score.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-7\">As to Johnson\u2019s contention that the signed contract washed-out, as it were, his prior misconduct, we hold it is utterly without basis. It is clear from the record that the contract of December 29th merely constituted a reduction to writing of the oral contract of October 21st.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-9\">Judgment will be entered affirming the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b333-7\">.
