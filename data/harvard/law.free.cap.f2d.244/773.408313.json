The single issue is stipulated to be:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b821-28\">Whether, in circumstances in which the Civil Aeronautics Board does not find the pilot to be unqualified to fly, the Board is em<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"774\">*774</page-number>powered under Section 609 of the Civil Aeronautics Act<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> to suspend his airman certificate as a deterrent sanction.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b822-4\">Under \u00a7 609, the Board \u201cmay reexamine any airman, and, after investigation, and upon notice and hearing, may alter, amend, modify, or <em>suspend, </em>* * * [his] airman certificate * * *, <em>if the interest of the public so requires </em>* * Emphasis added.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-7\">Petitioner argues that, since reexamination is a condition precedent to action under \u00a7 609, the section must be read to authorize suspension only for lack of competence or qualifications as an airman. Disciplinary action for violation of regulations, he says, is covered exclusively by \u00a7 901 of the Civil Aeronautics Act<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> which provides that a \u201cperson who violates [regulations] shall be subject to a civil penalty of not to exceed $1000 for each such violation.\u201d His view is that Congress did not authorize suspension of a certificate for disciplinary purposes. We cannot agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-8\">By resting suspension on a Board determination that \u201cthe interest of the public so requires,\u201d Congress conferred broad discretionary authority upon the Board. What Congress had in mind appears from the direction contained in \u00a7 601(b) of the Act<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> that the Act be administered \u201cin such manner as will best tend to reduce or eliminate the possibility of, or recurrence of, accidents in air transportation * * *.\u201d Nothing in the Act or its legislative history persuades us that disciplinary action for violation of regulations was intended to be the exclusive province of \u00a7 901.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-10\">Moreover, the Board has never recognized such exclusivity in its administration of the Act. From the effective date of the Act in 1938 through June 30, 1956, the Board has suspended approximately 4000 airmen for violation of rules, without findings that they lacked competence or qualifications and without r\u00e9quiring re-examination before reinstatement. This consistent and, until now, unchallenged administrative practice \u201cwill not be overturned except for very cogent reasons * * *.\u201d Norwegian Nitrogen Products Co. v. United States, 1933, 288 U.S. 294, 315, 53 S.Ct. 350, 358, 77 L.Ed. 796. The most cogent of reasons \u2014 air safety \u2014 supports the administrative practice here under attack.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-14\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b822-11\">. 52 Stat. 1011 (1938), 49 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 559.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b822-12\">. 52 Stat. 1015 (1938), 49 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 621.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b822-23\">. 52 Stat. 1007 (1938), 49 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 551</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
