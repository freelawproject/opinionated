Although the evidence was sufficient to support such an instruction the court denied appellant\u2019s request for an instruction that should the jury find in his favor they should take into consideration, in determining the amount of damages, the reasonable value of the time he had lost from his employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-17\">Within the principles laid down by this Court in Hudson v. Lazarus, 95 U.S.App.D.C. 16, 217 F.2d 344,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the denial of the requested instruction was error which requires reversal, notwithstanding appellant was paid the amount, of his salary for the period he was unable to work.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b424-18\">We have power in an appropriate case to remand only for redetermination of the amount of damages, excluding from the scope of a new trial the question of liability, see Washington Gas Light Co. v. Connolly, 94 U.S.App.D.C. 156, 214 F.2d 254, and cases there cited. But our power in this regard is-to be exercised with caution and not when the error which necessitates a new trial is in respect of a matter which might well have affected the jury\u2019s determination of other issues. Cf. Thompson v. Camp, 6 Cir., 167 F.2d 733. Here it appears from the record as a whole that the interests of justice will be best served by a new trial on all issues. For this reason the judgment is</p>\n<p id=\"b424-19\">Reversed and the case remanded for a new trial.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b424-12\">. See, also, Siebrand v. Gossnell, 9 Cir., 234 F.2d 81, 95; Shea v. Rettie, 287 Mass. 454, 192 N.E. 44, 95 A.L.R. 571; Motts v. Michigan Cab Co., 274 Mich. 437, 264 N.W. 855; Cooney v.
