Through an open door, the small boy entered a locker room adjacent to a ladies\u2019 rest room, where his mother had taken him. A bank of three tall steel lockers, not fastened to the floor or wall and tilted slightly forward, fell upon him and inflicted a serious head wound.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-7\">Appellant argues, <em>inter alia,, </em>that no negligence was shown and that tardy filing of a costs bond was improperly permitted. We have considered these contentions and the other reasons for reversal advanced by the appellant, but cannot accept them. We see no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-8\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
