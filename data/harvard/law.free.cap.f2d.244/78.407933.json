The policies covered loss caused by \u201cwindstorm\u201d but excluded loss caused by water \u201cwhether driven by wind or not\u201d. The question in the case is whether the damage to plaintiffs\u2019 house was caused by wind alone or by tidal waters driven by the wind. The case was heard without a jury by the District Judge, who, after intimating a decision in favor of the plaintiffs, reopened the case on motion of defendants and heard additional testimony but adhered to his original opinion. Vestal v. Glens Falls Insurance Co., 146 F.Supp. 494. No questions of law are presented by the appeal. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>only questions in the case are pure questions of fact. The District Judge saw and heard the witnesses, and there is nothing in the record which would justify us in holding that his findings of fact are clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
