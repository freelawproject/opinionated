After numerous attempts to vacate the judgment of conviction on various grounds, including several prior applications under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, all of which were denied and the rulings affirmed on appeal, United States v. Rosenberg, 2 Cir., 195 F.2d 583, and certiorari denied by the Supreme Court, 344 U.S. 838, 73 S.Ct. 21, 97 L.Ed. 652, appellant made the two motions which resulted in the order appealed from. The first motion is based upon the charge that, at the trial in 1951, the prosecution \u201cknowingly, willfully and intentionally used false and perjurious testimony and evidence, made false representations to the Court, and suppressed evidence which would have impeached and refuted testimony given against petitioner.\u201d The second motion is based upon the charge that the \u201cUnited States itself, as well as its courts i:' * * lacked all sovereignty and power to conduct the proceedings,\u201d and that the trial court lacked jurisdiction because of alleged violations of the Constitution and laws of the United States, including \u201cthe Extradition Treaty between the United States and Mexico.\u201d The subject matter of these charges relates to the seizure of appellant in Mexico City by the Mexican Security Police, his transportation to Laredo, Texas, where the United States Immigration Inspector made a record of appellant\u2019s entry on August 18, 1950 into the United States, and his arrest, pursuant to a warrant duly issued on August 3, 1950 in the Southern District of New York. While appellant asserts that his contentions have not been made before, the records of the District Court make it abundantly plain that, except for some elaboration in matters of detail and the articulation of what are alleged to be new legal theories, the charges are not new, but have already been rejected in one form or another. These prior proceedings and the procedural obstacles to any possible favorable action on the two new motions have been so fully set forth in the detailed discussion appearing in the well reasoned and comprehensive opinion of Judge Irving R. Kaufman, D.C., 142 F.Supp. 515, that we think it not necessary to do more than note our approval of what he has written.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-9\">The charges are of such a serious and sensational character, however, and upon careful examination they turn out on the face of the record to be so utterly groundless, that we shall briefly set forth our reasons for holding that the trial judge could not have arrived at any conclusion other than to decide, as he did, that there be no hearing on either application, as \u201cthe files and records of the case conclusively show that the prisoner is entitled to no relief,\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. There was no foisting of perjurious testimony upon the court and jury by the prosecution ; no false representations were made; there was no suppression of evidence ; there was no violation of the Extradition Treaty between the United States and Mexico, or of any of the provisions of the Constitution and laws of the United States; and the motions were properly denied <em>in toto.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b569-10\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b569-11\">At the trial there was evidence which definitely connected appellant with the aims and purposes and with the consummation of the ends of the espionage conspiracy. United States v. Rosenberg, 2 Cir., 195 F.2d 583, certiorari denied 344 U.S. 838, 73 S.Ct. 20, 97 L.Ed. 687, rehearing denied, Sobell v. U. S., 344 U.S. 889, 73 S.Ct. 180, 97 L.Ed. 687. This was supplemented by proof from which the jury might well have inferred that the Rosenbergs and appellant sus<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>pected .that the FBI was closing in on them. and.that an elaborate plan was devised vyhich, envisaged escape from the law. enforcement authorities of the United, States by flight to Mexico and thence by'way'of Vera Cruz' or some.other seaport; to Europe,. with' Soviet Russia as, the ultimate destination. We had another, phase, of this, same planned exodus to Mexico, .before, us in United States v. Perl, 2 Cir., 210 F.2d 457, in which case Perl .testified, in his own defense and de-. scribed how he was approached on the subject.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-5\">;The testimony in this case was to the effect that. Rosenberg outlined a pattern of flight for - David .Greenglass and his vyife that would take them to Mexico, then, to Europe via Vera Cruz and finally to Russia. Shortly after Greenglass and Harry Gold, another member of the spy ring, were apprehended, appellant began to follow' the pattern of flight outlined by Rosenberg to the Greenglasses.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-7\">Accordingly, the prosecution proved at the trial that appellant with his wife and children went to Mexico City in the spring of 1950. Had this been a vacation jaunt for a brief sojourn, with the intention of returning to the United States, there was ample opportunity for appellant\u2019s experienced and astute trial counsel to adduce evidence to prove it; but no-such evidence, testimonial or documentary, was forthcoming, and appellant did-not,even testify in his own defense. . \u25a0 The prosecution, on the other hand, produced a number of witnesses who made it clear that appellant went to Mexico for purposes of flight, with a quite settled determination not to return to thq United States if he could avoid doing so, The relevancy and sufficiency of this evidence have already been passed upon. . United States v. Rosenberg, supra. .</p>\n<p id=\"b570-8\">. The-witness Manuel Giner de los Rios, who lived in the same apartment house as,appellant in Mexico City, testified that, he became acquainted with appellant, who told him some time in July that he was an -American and was afraid that \u201cthey .were looking for him so that he would have to go in the Army\u201d; that appellant was looking for information as to how to get out of Mexico; that a few days later appellant asked for directions, of how to go to Vera Cruz,'which the witness gave him; that appellant was away for about 15 days, somewhere around the 20th or 22nd of July, 1950, during which' period of time the witness received from - appellant in the mail an envelope postmarked Vera Cruz addressed to the witness, containing a letter which the witness delivered to appellant\u2019s -wife, and another postmarked Tampico, another Mexican seaport, also containing a letter for appellant\u2019s wife.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-10\">. Other witnesses testified to the use by appellant of false names and an elaborate system of correspondence from appellant in Mexico, enclosing letters for delivery to members of appellant\u2019s family in the United States, with return addresses on the envelopes and the names \u201cM. Sowell\u201d and \u201cM. Levitov.\u201d The effort to avoid interception and detection is perfectly plain. Indeed, in one of his prior Section 2255 applications appellant stated: <em>\u201cI </em>left the family in the Mexico City apartment and travelled around Mexico to Vera Cruz and Tam-pico, even using false names and inquiring about passage to Europe and South America for all of us.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b570-12\">The proof of appellant\u2019s return to the United States by the Mexican Security Police merely supplemented the proof of appellant\u2019s consciousness of guilt by explaining his presence at the trial, which appellant appears to concede was not voluntary. As we said on the first appeal, United States v. Rosenberg, supra, 195 F.2d at page 602, \u201cotherwise the jury might have inferred that he had returned voluntarily to stand trial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b570-13\">So we turn to the specifications of alleged perjury, false representations and suppression of evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-14\">Immigration Inspector Huggins testified that on August 18, 1950 about nine Mexican officials brought appellant to him in Laredo, Texas, that he filled out the manifest, which is now challenged as palpably false, noting from what he had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>observed and not from anything said to him by the Mexican officials, \u201cDeported From Mexico,\u201d and further data, such as appellant\u2019s occupation of electrical engineer, that he had spent all his life in the United States \u201cuntil about two months ago,\u201d his age, address, and so on, from answers given to him by appellant. On the reverse side of the manifest, under \u201cRemarks and Endorsements\u201d is written, \u201cBrought to Imm. Office by Mex. Police,\u201d followed by the signatures of Inspector Huggins and appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-4\">By some process of reasoning that is far from clear to us, this is supposed to be wilful perjury because appellant asserts that he was assaulted and \u201ckidnapped\u201d by the Mexican Security Police, as agents of or instigated by the FBI, and brought to Laredo, Texas, without any formal deportation proceedings, which we are told are elaborate and technical and always observed with meticulous care by the Mexican authorities.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-5\">But appellant was nonetheless deported and the witness did no more than testify to what he personally observed, or was told by appellant, and noted in the manifest in the regular course of his official duties. It is nothing short of absurd to characterize this as wilful perjury deliberately foisted on the trial court by the prosecution. There was no perjury.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-6\">The charge that the judgment of conviction cannot stand because the prosecutor procured it by false reprsesentations also falls of its own weight. On appellant\u2019s motion in arrest of judgment, made shortly after the conclusion of the trial, and on April 5, 1951, his counsel referred to the manifest prepared by Inspector Huggins as a \u201cdownright falsehood,\u201d and read into the record an affidavit of appellant describing the \u201ckidnapping\u201d in some detail, in the course of which appellant stated that he tried to show the Mexican police his \u201cpapers, visas etc.,\u201d concluding with the charge that the United States had secured jurisdiction over appellant \u201cby a criminal, illegal, act, and so the United States must send Sobell back to the place where they took him from, to deal with him accordingly some time in the future.\u201d This motion was denied and the order affirmed and certiorari denied, and this forms part of the background described in the opinion of Judge Irving R. Kaufman, supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-8\">The alleged false statements were made by the prosecutor who spoke briefly, after counsel for appellant had fully stated the grounds for his motion in arrest of judgment. The first of these is:.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b571-9\">\u201cThis very affidavit (of Sobell) contains a falsehood in the statement-that there was exhibited amongst \u25a0 other things to the Mexican author- \u2022 ities visas. Counsel ought to know that his client never went into Mexico with a visa.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b571-10\">This is supposed to be false because, although appellant concededly had no visa, he did have a tourist card, which counsel now insists is a \u201ctourist card (visa).\u201d Thus the charge collapses! The statement as made was in all respects true. The balance of the claim of wilful deception of the court has in effect already been disposed of. The prosecutor said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b571-11\">\u201cThe whole affidavit (of Sobell) portrays certainly that this defendant was not honorably escorted from Mexico but that literally he was kicked out as a deportee.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b571-12\">As the trial judge had the affidavit before him, it is difficult to see how any characterization of its contents could possibly justify a charge of wilful misrepresentation and deception; but in fact the statement was accurate. Appellant was deported from Mexico; he did not return to the United States voluntarily; and the expression \u201ckicked out,\u201d while perhaps offensive to a refined ear, describes precisely what happened to him on August 18, 1950.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-13\">The alleged suppression of evidence is more of the same thing, with some elaboration. Appellant\u2019s international vaccination certificate is mentioned but appellant knew of its existence, made no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>reference to it at the trial, and he must have realized that it would cut both ways if oifered in evidence. He might well have claimed that its possession demonstrated an intention to return to the United States, but the prosecution would just as likely have argued to the contrary. None of the remaining so-called \u201cfacts of abduction\u201d tended in the slightest degree, to demonstrate that appellant would have returned to the United States of his own volition. Nor are we able to discern any suppression of any .evidence by the prosecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-4\">The nub of the matter is that what appellant now asserts he asserted in substance and in the most unequivocal way in his motion in arrest of judgment. It was then clear that what he then knew was available for his defense at the trial but, as stated by Judge Frank in his opinion on the first appeal, United States v. Rosenberg, 195 F.2d at page- 603: \u201cHe preferred to take his chances on the verdict, withholding his trump card until the trial was over. The Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure [18 U.S.C.A.] allow no such tactic.\u201d We may add that the \u201ctrump card\u201d would probably have proved more harmful than beneficial to appellant\u2019s defense. At least it is fair to assume that such was the conclusion arrived at by his trial counsel. They decided not to pursue the subject at the trial, further than upon the cross-examination of Inspector Huggins, who testified that he was expecting appellant at Laredo, Texas, and \u201cwe had a lookout on him to prevent his departure from the United States.\u201d When this testimony was thus elicited, counsel for appellant stated, \u201cthat is just exactly what I wanted to get at,\u201d but the subject was not pursued further after Inspector Huggins left the witness stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-5\">The cases relied upon by appellant, such as Hysler v. Florida, 315 U.S. 411, 62 S.Ct. 688, 86 L.Ed. 932; Hazel-Atlas Glass Co. v. Hartford-Empire Co., 322 U.S. 238, 64 S.Ct. 997, 88 L.Ed. 1250, and Mesarosh v. United States, 352 U.S. 1, 77 S.Ct. 1, 1 L.Ed.2d 1 and others, where the court found perjured testimony had been used or there was improper conduct on the part of prosecuting officers, involve facts which bear not even a remote resemblance to the factual background of this case; the principles stated in those cases have no application here.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b572-8\">Appellant\u2019s supplementary motion also rests upon the charge that he was forcibly abducted from Mexico by the Mexican Security Police as agents of the United States. He contends that the alleged abduction was a violation of the Extradition Treaty between the United States and Mexico, 31 Stat. 1818, and that as a result the United States lacked power to proceed against him. He relies upon Cook v. United States, 288 U.S. 102, 53 S.Ct. 305, 77 L.Ed. 641, which holds that the United States courts may not acquire jurisdiction by means of a treaty violation. As appellant says, his \u201cobjection to national and, consequently, judicial power does not rest on the kidnapping or abduction of appellant as such, but rather upon the violation of the treaty.\u201d We must inquire, therefore, whether there has been a violation of the treaty with Mexico.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-9\">It seems too plain for reasonable debate that Ker v. Illinois, 119 U.S. 436, 7 S.Ct. 225, 30 L.Ed. 421, answers that question in the negative, even if appellant\u2019s factual assertions be taken as true. That case involved a treaty with Peru, 18 Stat. 719, in all pertinent respects the same as the one before us, i.e., each treaty provides for extradition for certain named crimes and neither the treaty with Peru nor the treaty with Mexico in terms prohibits abduction by one party of criminals found in the territory of the other. Ker, who had been charged with a crime committed in the United States, had left the country and was located in Peru. The President of the United States issued a warrant and sent a messenger to Peru to receive Ker from the Peruvian authorities in compliance with the treaty. Instead, the messenger kidnapped Ker and returned him forcibly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>to the United States. Ker excepted to the jurisdiction of the court but was convicted. Upon Supreme Court review of affirmance of his conviction by the Illinois court, Ker urged two other grounds for reversal,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b573-5\">\u201cBut the main proposition insisted on by counsel for plaintiff in error in this court is, that, by virtue of the treaty of extradition with Peru, the defendant acquired by his residence in that country a right of asylum, \u2014 a right to be free from molestation for the crime committed in Illinois, a positive right in him that he should only be forcibly removed from Peru to the state of Illinois in accordance with the provisions of the treaty, \u2014 and that this right is one which he can assert in the courts of the United States in all cases, whether the removal took place under proceedings sanctioned by the treaty, or under proceedings which were in total disregard of that treaty, amounting to an unlawful and unauthorized kidnapping.\u201d 119 U.S. at page 441, 7 S.Ct. at page 228.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b573-7\">Although the language appellant uses is slightly different, there can be no doubt that he is asserting precisely the same claim as did Ker, which claim was rejected by the Supreme Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-8\">And the Ker case continues to have validity. It was cited in the Cook case, relied upon by appellant, and in Frisbie v. Collins, 342 U.S. 519, at page 522, 72 S.Ct. 509, at page 511, 96 L.Ed. 541, where the Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b573-9\">\u201cThis Court has never departed from the rule announced in Ker v. Illinois, 119 U.S. 436, 444, 7 S.Ct. 225, 229, 30 L.Ed. 421, that the power of a court to try a person for crime is not impaired by the fact that he had been brought within the court\u2019s jurisdiction by reason of a \u2018forcible abduction.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b573-10\">Appellant seeks to avoid the impact of the Ker case by insisting that, although there was no treaty violation in that case, there was such a violation in the case at bar. \u201cUnlike the facts in Ker,\u201d appellant says, \u201cthe petition here charges action by the United States Government * * Appellant relies on \u201cThe actions of the United States\u2019 agents in initiating, planning and participating in the seizure.\u201d But it can hardly be maintained, still assuming the truth of appellant\u2019s charges, that the unlawful and unauthorized acts of the Mexican police acting in behalf of subordinate agents of the executive branch of the United States Government were any more acts of the United States than the unlawful and unauthorized acts of the emissary of the Chief Executive. We think the question presented is indistinguishable from that before the Supreme Court in Ker, and that our decision here is controlled by that case.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-13\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
