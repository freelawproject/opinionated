In addition, the appellant Darneille was charged with violation of the Harrison Act in Count 1, and with violation of the Jones-Miller Act in Count 2. The remaining thirteen counts related solely to co-defendant Charles Garcia, Sr., who with Charles Garcia, Jr., pleaded guilty to certain of the charges prior to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>commencement of the trial. Charles Garcia, Jr., was named in Counts 1 and 2, together with his father and Dar-neille.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b182-4\">After a jury trial all the four appellants were found guilty as charged on Count 16. Darneille was also found guilty on Count 1 and not guilty on Count 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-5\">Each appellant was sentenced to a term of five years\u2019 imprisonment and was fined $1 on Count 16. In addition, Darneille was sentenced to five years\u2019 imprisonment and was fined $1 on Count 1, his sentences of imprisonment on Counts 1 and 16 to run concurrently. From judgment imposing these sentences, the present appeal has been taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-6\">2. <em>The Appellee\u2019s Evidence</em></p>\n<p id=\"b182-7\">After testimony by two chemists for the Treasury Department regarding the seized heroin, Ira Charles Feldman, an agent of the Bureau of Narcotics, testified that he first met the appellant Ferrari in Ciro\u2019s Bar, 645 Geary Street, San Francisco, on July 6, 1955, where Ferrari was \u201ctending bar\u201d. Feldman told Ferrari that he was \u201can investment broker from the East\u201d, and that he \u201cbought and sold things, small things, something that he could put \u2022 in [his] pocket, carry around, and turn over for a fast buck.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b182-8\">Ferrari replied that he knew what Feldman wanted, but things were \u201cpretty tight\u201d, and that he himself hadn\u2019t \u201cbeen paid in the last two months\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-9\">On the evening of July 8, 1955, Feld-man was introduced by appellant Ferrari to appellant Knight, who was also behind the bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-10\">On July 17, 1955, Feldman invited Ferrari to his apartment, saying that he thought they could \u201cmake a deal\u201d. Ferrari replied that he couldn\u2019t make it that evening, but that he was sure that in a few days he \u201ccould come up and he would be very happy to talk\u201d. Feld-man told Ferrari what he wanted to talk about.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-16\">On July 20, 1955, again at Ciro\u2019s Bar, Feldman met Ferrari and Knight and invited them to his apartment. Ferrari again said that he \u201ccouldn\u2019t make it, but [that] Knight could make it. Ferrari departed shortly afterward, but Feldman remained. By prearrangement with Feldman, Janet Jones, alias Janet Howard, a special employee of the Bureau of Narcotics, came up to the bar, and Knight was introduced to her. Since \u201cbusiness was not very good\u201d, Knight joined Miss Jones and Feldman in a back booth.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-17\">Knight said that he would \u201cbe happy\u201d to go up to Feldman\u2019s apartment that night, and said that he would like to take his \u201clady friend\" after the bar was closed.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-18\">At 2 a.m. on July 21, 1955 Knight closed the bar, and said that he would pick up his \u201cgirl\u201d. Feldman and Miss Jones went on ahead to Feldman\u2019s apartment, and at 2:45 a.m. were joined there by Knight and Marie Hagler, whose surname at first appears erroneously as \u201cHeller\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-19\">While the girls were absent from the room, Knight asked Feldman, \u201cWhat do you want, black or white?\u201d Feld-man asked him what he meant, and Knight replied, \u201cJunk\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-20\">Feldman testified that \u201cwhite\u201d meant heroin, and \u201cblack\u201d opium, while \u201cjunk\u201d stood for the generic term, \u201cnarcotics\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-21\">Feldman told Knight that he wanted \u201cwhite stuff\u201d. Knight said that one had to be careful in San Francisco, that the \u201cfeds\u201d were \u201call over\u201d, and that he would contact Feldman on the following day.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-22\">On the evening of July 22, 1955, Feld-man met Knight, Ferrari, and \u201cBones\u201d Darneille, another of the appellants. He also met Dave Miflin, a defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>who was convicted, but as to whom a motion for acquittal was granted by the trial judge. The disposition of his case does not appear in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-5\">This time Ferrari accepted an invitation to go to Feldman\u2019s apartment that night, after he closed up the bar. But once again Ferrari failed to show up. After waiting for him at Ciro\u2019s until approximately 2 a.m., July 23, 1955, Darneille, Miflin, Feldman, Miss Jones alias Howard, and two females that they picked up en route \u2014 who rejoiced in the alliterative names of \u201cJune\u201d and \u201cJy-rene\u201d \u2014 went to Feldman\u2019s apartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-6\">How Ferrari managed to elude Feld-man and his party at Ciro\u2019s is not explained.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-7\">In the absence of the \u201cladies\u201d, Darneille, Miflin, and Feldman conversed in the living room. Darneille admired Feldman\u2019s apartment, and said that after seeing how Feldman lived, he knew what Feldman did. He confessed that at first he hadn\u2019t trusted Feldman. He said that he thought they could get together, \u201cand make a couple of grand apiece\u201d. Darneille said he wouldn\u2019t \u201cmove anything less than a pound and mostly kilos\u201d.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b183-9\">Feldman told Darneille that on the previous night, he had \u201cmade a pitch to a guy about narcotics\u201d. Darneille replied: \u201cI know about the pitch * * * Red Knight told me.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b183-10\">On the morning of July 23, 1955, Feldman received a telephone call from Knight, informing him that \u201cBones\u201d [Darneille] still wanted to see Feldman and deal with him.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-16\">On the evening of July 26, 1955 and the morning of July 27, 1955, Feldman and Miss Jones met Darneille at Harold\u2019s Rebound Club, on Geary Street, and the three went to Feldman\u2019s apartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-17\">Darneille said that he knew \u201cnarcotics backwards and forwards, that he had fooled with narcotics for the last twenty-five years, that he smoked opium for the last fifteen years, and that he had \u201ckicked\u201d the habit \u201cjust three years ago\u201d. He added:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b183-18\">\u201cWithin a few days, Ike, we will have a deal. * * * We will all make some money. * * * There is nothing about junk I don\u2019t know.\u201d On the evening of July 27, 1955, at</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ADR\">Harold\u2019s Rebound Club, which is \u201capproximately eater-cornered from Ciro\u2019s\u201d \u201con Geary Street between Leavenworth and Jones\u201d, Darneille introduced appellant Cherpakov to Feldman as \u201cJack Cherry\u201d. Later that night, Cherpakov said to Feldman:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b183-19\">\u201cIke, you\u2019re doing pretty good. You are here only a month and you are scoring already. * * * You can\u2019t get any bigger than Red Ferrari. If you do right by Red, you will be O.K. If you do wrong by Red * * * you will end up in an alley.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b183-21\">At Feldman\u2019s apartment that night, Darneille said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b183-22\">\u201cIke, O.K. the next day or so. I\u2019ll make $10,000, he [Cherpakov] will make $10,000, and you will make $100,000.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b183-23\">On July 28, 1955, Feldman noticed that Ciro\u2019s Bar, which was closed on July 22, 1955,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> by the State authorities <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>because of a \u201clegal beef\u201d, had been reopened. Ferrari was tending bar as of yore, and Darneille and Cherpakov were there too. Darneille informed Feldman that \u201cWe got the deal,\u201d which was \u201call set in a day or so.\u201d After Darneille and Cherpakov had left, <em>Ferrari wanted to know whether Feldman \u201cwas going to do business with them\u201d. </em>Feldman said \u201cYes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b184-4\">Before Cherpakov left the bar, Feld-man gave him the address and the telephone of a New York gangster as a reference.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-5\">On July 29, 1955, Feldman saw Dar-neille at Ciro\u2019s, while Ferrari was tending bar. Again Darneille said that \u201cIt\u2019s just a matter of a day or two.\u201d Once again, on July, 30, 1955, at Ciro\u2019s Bar, Darneille said to Feldman: \u201cIke, the deal is ready. Just hang on.\u201d * * * \u201cAny minute we got the deal.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b184-6\">Finally, on the night of July 31, 1955, while Ferrari and Darneille were at the bar, the latter said to Feldman, \u201cGo to see Charlie [Garcia] and get the junk.\u201d Garcia was at the \u201cMaeombo\u201d Bar on Grant Avenue.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-7\">At about 12:45 in the morning of August 1, 1955, Feldman introduced himself to Garcia, Sr., at the Maeombo, where the latter was tending bar. Garcia had been expecting him, and knew where Feldman\u2019s apartment was. Garcia agreed to meet Feldman as soon as Garcia closed the bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-8\">About two hours later, Garcia, Sr., went to Feldman\u2019s apartment with another man, whom he introduced as his brother Bob, but who was subsequently identified at Charles Clarence Garcia, Jr., his son.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-9\">At that time Feldman brusquely told his visitors that all they had been asking for had been \u201creferences\u201d. He threw $20,000 down on the couch, and told them \u201cto put up or shut up\u201d. The Garcias said that they would return Tuesday evening to give their answer, \u201cchecking with their friends as to what they could get and how much.\u201d Senior said that they wouldn\u2019t \u201cmove for less than a pound or even a kilo\u201d. Senior told Feldman that it was O.K. to deal with Ferrari, who was \u201ca good guy\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-11\">On the evening of August 2, 1955, the Garcias again went to Feldman\u2019s apartment. Senior said that he had \u201ccontacted\u201d his \u201cpeople\u201d, and that they could get Feldman \u201cas much as you want when you want it\u201d. However, he added that the Garcias were going to take their time, since he and his associates didn\u2019t \u201cwant to get caught\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-12\">Senior quoted a price of $450 an ounce, and Feldman made a counteroffer of $400 an ounce, and said he was willing to buy a kilo. Senior then left to telephone to his \u201cpeople\u201d to \u201csee what they want to do\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-13\">The Garcias returned in about an hour, and Senior reported that his \u201cpeople\u201d said that it was O.K. \u201cWe\u2019ll deal for $400 an ounce, but I\u2019ll only get you a pound this time to see if you like it. * * * If you like it, then we can start dealing in kilos.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b184-15\">\n<em>Thereupon Feldman paid over to the Garcias 6k $100 bills.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b184-16\">On the evening of August 4, 1955, at Ciro\u2019s, Ferrari, who, as usual, was tending bar, went over to Feldman and warned him to \u201cget out of here\u201d because \u201cThe feds, the government, are looking for you.\u201d Ferrari added, <em>\u201cLook, Ike, if you get in trouble I am in trouble.\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b184-17\">On August 13, 1955, Feldman received from Junior delivery of 13 ounces, 365 grains of narcotics, in six rubber containers, in a paper bag, at \u201cthe Bayside Motel, Cabin 25, fourth drawer down, * * * [in] a paper bag\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-19\">On August 2, 1955, Feldman had complained to Senior that a man \u201cpassing himself off as Bones Eemmer\u201d was in reality Bones Darneille. When Feldman went back to Ferrari on August 17, 1955, the two men talked about Darneille, and Ferrari said he was \u201csorry\u201d, that \u201cthere was a misunderstanding between Bones Darneille and\u201d Feldman, \u201cand that Bones would be in and we could straighten it out.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b185-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>On the same evening, Feldman informed Senior that the narcotics were of inferior quality. On August 18, 1955, in Ciro\u2019s Bar, Cherpakov said to Feldman, \u201cIt\u2019s rough, the way you deal, in pound lots.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b185-3\">On August 22, 1955, at Ciro\u2019s in the presence of Darneille, Cherpakov expressed regret that \u201cthe stuff wasn\u2019t any good\u201d, and Darneille said, \u201cYou know, you got to be careful. This town is hot; a lot of federal agents around here.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b185-4\">At that meeting, Cherpakov told Feld-man that the latter could go across the border to Juarez, Mexico, and \u201cget the stuff for $100 an ounce\u201d, adding: \u201cThe thing that costs a lot of money is bringing it across the border.\u201d On the same occasion, Cherpakov commented that Feldman had been in town only a month and had \u201cscored already\u201d, adding: \u201cThere\u2019s none bigger than Red Ferrari and Ciro\u2019s.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b185-5\">\n<em>Feldmcm had not previously discussed with any of the appellants, but only with the Garcias, the quantity or quality of the narcotics that had been delivered to him, or the fact that such a purchase had been made.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b185-6\">On August 17, 1955, Ferrari refused a dinner invitation from Feldman saying:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b185-7\">\u201cNo, Ike, I am afraid to go out with you. * * * I know what you are doing. I know who you are dealing with. I don\u2019t know about your deals. I can\u2019t go out with you. Like I told you once before, I don\u2019t want no trouble, and we aren\u2019t going to have any trouble.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b185-9\">For the first time, it was developed on cross-examination of Feldman that his apartment was \u201cbugged\u201d, or \u201cwired\u201d for sound, and that the listening devices had been monitored by other agents who \u201cwere located adjacent to the apartment\u201d, \u201cyou could not call it the same apartment\u201d, \u201cIn another room\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-10\">Feldman testified as to the disposition of the recordings as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b185-12\">The recordings were brought back to the Federal Office Building and each morning the agents would make their official daily reports from the recordings. <em>Then we would take the recording and reuse it again, and as you re-use the recording, it erased all the old writing and conversation and recorded the new conversation.\u201d it</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"AvK\">Testimony offered through Treasury Agent Milton K. Wu as to conversations overheard by him by means of \u201ccertain listening devices\u201d was not admitted by the Court, on objection by counsel for the defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-13\">Each appellant testified as a witness in his own behalf.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-14\">3. <em>The Evidence Supported the Verdict Against Each Appellant.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b185-15\">Ferrari and Darneille maintain that the evidence was insufficient to support the verdict as to either of them. Cherpakov made no such claim. Knight filed no brief, and was not represented by counsel at the oral argument before this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-16\">The arguments of Ferrari and Dar-neille on this point will be considered together.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-17\">The evidence clearly establishes the concert of action and the community of purpose of all the appellants. By their own admissions, they were well acquainted with each other. They were admittedly intimately familiar with traffic in narcotics, either as users or convicted peddlers. Except Cherpakov, they also admitted having discussed narcotics with Feldman, although they gave versions of the conversations that were innocuous, so far as they were concerned.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-18\">Cherpakov testified that when he heard Feldman ask Darneille how many ounces were in a kilo, he warned Darneille not to \u201ctalk about narcotics\u201d, since \u201cthey can get you for conspiracy if you talk about it.\u201d Cherpakov also stated in the latter part of August, at Ciro\u2019s, Feld-man informed him that \u201che had scored\u201d. \u201cScored\u201d, in the language of the narcotic underworld, means \u201csucceeded in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>making a purchase\u201d. Cherpakov claimed on the stand that he made no reply to Feldman\u2019s announcement, but that they \u201ctalked about other things\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-4\">As we have seen from Feldman\u2019s testimony, fully summarized, supra, each appellant was aware of the discussions had by the others regarding narcotics, when they were not personally present. The underground of the underworld is extremely efficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-5\">Only the hopelessly naive can doubt that the appellee has adduced substantial evidence to sustain its case. The sophisticated reader of the record will be convinced that, not only as to Cherpakov and Knight \u2014 who do not gainsay it \u2014 but also as to Ferrari and Darneille, there is ample testimony to support the verdicts.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-6\">In Stoppelli v. United States, 9 Cir., 1950, 183 F.2d 391, 393, certiorari denied, 1950, 340 U.S. 864, 71 S.Ct. 88, 95 L.Ed. 631, this Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b186-7\">\u201cIt is not for us to say that the evidence was insufficient because we, or any of us, believe that inferences other than guilt could be drawn from it. To say that would make us triers of the fact. We may say that the evidence is insufficient to sustain the verdict only if we can conclude as <em>a matter of law </em>that reasonable minds, as triers of the fact, must be in agreement that reasonable hypotheses other than guilt could be drawn from the evidence. [Case cited.] In the cited case, Judge Prettyman pertinently observes: \u2018If the judge were to direct acquittal whenever in his opinion the evidence failed to exclude every hypothesis but that of guilt, he would preempt the functions of the jury. Under such rule, the judge would have to be convinced of guilt beyond peradventure of doubt before the jury would be permitted to consider the case.\u2019 [Curley v. U. S., 81 U.S.App.D.C. 229] 160 F.2d at page 233. [Case cited.]\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b186-10\">4. <em>There Was No Abuse of Discretion in the Denial of a Motion for a Mistrial on the Ground of Newspaper Publicity.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b186-11\">Counsel for Ferrari moved for a mistrial, on the ground that he had a \u201cfeeling * * * from reading the newspapers, that the government, through some of its agents, have attempted to influence and prejudice the minds of this jury by revealing to the newspapers what, allegedly, a witness would testify to and allegedly grounds for her testifying.\u201d Counsel then quoted from articles in two San Francisco newspapers relating to the expected testimony of a \u201cMiss Davis\u201d, <em>infra, </em>who, the San Francisco Examiner reported, \u201cwas prepared to testify that Ferrari acted as her procurer and supplied her with narcotics across the bar of his Ciro\u2019s tavern,\u201d and who, according to the San Francisco News, \u201cwas afraid to testify, afraid of the mob,\u201d etc. Darneille, who has filed briefs in this Court in propria persona, did not join in the motion but is raising the objection in this Court. We are considering the contentions of both appellants.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-13\">There was no request that the jury be examined on voir dire to determine whether they had read the newspaper articles, and, if so, whether they had been influenced thereby.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-14\">In United States v. Carruthers, 7 Cir., 1945, 152 F.2d 512, 519, certiorari denied, 1946, 327 U.S. 787, 66 S.Ct. 805, 90 L.Ed. 1014, rehearing denied, 1946, 327 U.S. 817, 66 S.Ct. 816, 90 L.Ed. 1040, second petition for rehearing denied, 1946, 327 U.S. 819, 66 S.Ct. 897, 90 L.Ed. 1014, the Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b186-15\">\u201cIt cannot be denied but that the newspaper article in question was inflammatory and prejudicial in character and its publication prior to verdict, improper and unethical. Its publication could, under some circumstances have brought to naught a long, tedious and expensive trial. Whether the Court should have in this instance declared a mistrial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>depends upon all the circumstances. A motion of this character is addressed to the sound discretion of the trial Court, [Cases cited] and the burden is upon appellant to show an abuse of discretion and prejudice to him. [Cases cited.] If Juror Vincent read the article at all, he could not remember its contents. * * * If the juror read the inflammatory portion of the article at all, it apparently made no impression as he appeared to have no recollection concerning it. We can only assume that the jury answered the trial court\u2019s inquiries truthfully, and, so assuming, we find that no juror except Vincent read the article and that Vincent\u2019s mind was in no way affected by what he had seen or read. Under such circumstances we think appellant has failed to show prejudice resulting to him from the publication of the article and we hold that there was no abuse of discretion on the part of the trial court in the denial of his motion.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b187-8\">Ferrari further complains that \u201cThe effect of this newspaper publicity was not removed by any admonitions to the jury during the course of the trial or prior to its commencement\u201d. The record of proceedings on <em>voir dire </em>during the selection of the jury is not before us. In any event, in the absence of proof that any member of the jury saw or heard the stories mentioned, failure to tell the jurors not to read newspapers or listen to the radio is not reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-9\">In United States v. Griffin, 3 Cir., 1949, 176 F.2d 727, 731, certiorari denied, 1950, 338 U.S. 952, 70 S.Ct. 478, 94 L.Ed. 588, rehearing denied, 1950, 339 U.S. 916, 70 S.Ct. 559, 94 L.Ed. 1341, the Court used the following language:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AWj\">\u201cThere is no proof that the jury or any member of it saw or heard the stories mentioned, but assuming that this did occur, there is not the slightest reason for inferring that real harm resulted to appellant thereby. [Case cited.] Complaint is made that the Court in its above admonition did not directly tell the jury not to read the newspapers or listen to the radio. In our judgment, the Court was entitled to consider as he did, that he was dealing with an intelligent American jury of honesty and integrity. He told its members plainly [as here] that they were to decide the case only on the evidence they heard in the court room, not what they \u2018might happen to hear or read elsewhere\u2019.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b187-11\">In the instant case, the District Court\u2019s1 precise words of caution to the jury were as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b187-12\">\u201cIf you have had occasion to read any newspaper accounts or listen to any radio publicity or television, or anything like that in connection with this case, I counsel you to disregard it. You are to try this case solely upon the evidence that has been presented here in court.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b187-13\">In his closing brief, counsel for Ferrari complains that, rather than giving the jury \u201ca strong admonition to disregard newspaper publicity,\u201d the court merely stated \u201cI counsel you to disregard it.\u201d We feel sure that, in the language of Griffin, the \u201cintelligent American jury of honesty and integrity\u201d understood what the District Judge meant and comprehended what their duty was, after listening to the Court read <em>the entire paragraph, supra. </em>A class in higher semantics might be interested in the distinction between \u201ccounsel\u201d and \u201cadmonition\u201d: so far as this case is concerned, we are not. The appellants did not complain of the instruction when it was given, as required by Rule 30 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, 18 U.S.C.A., <em>infra, </em>and they submitted no alternative instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-14\">Long before the advent of radio or television, Mr. Justice Holmes, in Holt v. United States, 1910, 218 U.S. 245, 251, 31 S.Ct. 2, 5, 54 L.Ed. 1021, used language that is even more timely today than it was when he uttered it:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b187-15\">\u201cThe counsel for the prisoner filed his own affidavit that members of the jury had stated to him that they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>had read the Seattle daily papers with articles on the case, while the trial was going on. [The appellant here has made no such showing.] He set forth articles contained in those papers, and moved for a new trial. The court refused to receive counter affidavits, but, assuming in favor of the prisoner that the jurors had read the articles, he denied the motion. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b188-4\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b188-5\"><em>\u201cIf the mere opportunity for prejudice or corruption is to raise a presumption that they exist, it will be hard to maintain jury trial under the conditions of the present day. </em>[Emphasis supplied.]\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b188-6\">As was observed in an article entitled \u201cDue Process for Whom \u2014 Newspaper or Defendant?\u201d, appearing in the Stanford Law Review for December, 1951, Volume 4, No. 1, pages 105-106:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b188-7\">\u201cBut not every factual interference with a trial is a violation of due process. <em>The parties may not demand trial in a vacuum. </em>Newspaper interference, like any other interference, will not cause an unfair trial, unless it is serious enough to be a violation of our ideas of justice.\u201d [Emphasis supplied.] <footnotemark>4</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b188-8\">5. <em>The Testimony of Gloria Davis Was Admissible to Impeach Ferrari, and the District Judge\u2019s Instructions Protected Darneille from Being Harmed by It.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b188-10\">Both Ferrari and Darneille assert error in the admission of the testimony of Gloria Davis. Their arguments will be considered separately,</p>\n<p id=\"b188-11\">(a) <em>Ferrari\u2019s Contentions</em></p>\n<p id=\"asu-dedup-0\">Ferrari recites that \u201con cross-examination by the United States Attorney,\u201d he gave the following testimony:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b188-14\">\u201cQ. Have you ever sold any narcotics ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b188-15\">\u201cA. No, I haven\u2019t.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b188-16\">The appellant contends that \u201cThe issue raised by this particular question had not been gone into on direct examination,\u201d etc. Here Ferrari commits his initial error in re Gloria Davis. His counsel <em>had </em>gone into the question of Ferrari\u2019s sale of narcotics. On direct examination, the appellant was asked:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b188-17\">\u201cQ. Have you had in your possession or have you seen within the last year, year and a half, Mr. Ferrari, any narcotics whatsoever?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b188-18\">\u201cA. None whatsoever.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b188-19\">Mrs. Davis testified that she had purchased narcotics from Ferrari \u201cAbout a year and a half ago now\u201d, that is, during a period beginning about a year and a half from the time at which she was testifying. She also testified that she had been \u201cworking as a call girl\u201d for Ferrari.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-20\">The appellant insists that \u201cThe law is quite clear that impeachment on a collateral issue is not permissible\u201d. But the Supreme Court has held that where the defendant has, on direct examination, \u201cmade the sweeping claim\u201d that he has \u201cnever dealt in or possessed any narcotics,\u201d \u201cthere is hardly justification for letting the defendant affirmatively resort to perjurious testimony in reliance on the Government\u2019s disability to challenge his credibility.\u201d <footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b188-21\">In the instant case, Ferrari made a \u201csweeping\u201d denial that, during the preceding year and a half, he had neither <em>seen </em>nor <em>possessed </em>any narcotics \u201cwhatsoever\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-22\">Whatever doctrinaire criticism might be made of the admission of Mrs. Davis\u2019 testimony, any possible prejudice to Ferrari was obviated by the following spe-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>ci\u00f1e and emphatic instruction to the jury-given by the District Judge:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b189-4\">\u201cYou are instructed that the testimony of Gloria Davis does not relate to the guilt or innocence of any of the defendants.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b189-5\">\u201cMrs. Davis\u2019s testimony was admitted for one purpose, and one purpose only, that is, to impeach the testimony of the defendant Ferrari and the only effect that such testimony can have is to assist you in determining the credibility of the defendant Renaldo Ferrari.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b189-6\">We do not subscribe to the school of thought that, while insisting that the trial judge shall instruct the jury fully and accurately on all pertinent legal questions, is prone to assume that, in a given instance, the jury didn\u2019t pay attention to the court\u2019s instructions anyway, but were carried away by their own pet prejudices !</p>\n<p id=\"b189-7\">(b) <em>Darneille\u2019s Contentions</em></p>\n<p id=\"AIT\">Darneille did not raise any objection to Gloria Davis\u2019s testimony in his opening brief, but only in his closing one. We do not consider this \u201cfair debating\u201d. Furthermore, he has failed to give either the -\u201cfull\u201d or <em>any </em>\u201csubstance of the evidence admitted\u201d, as required by our Rule 18 (2) (d), 28 U.S.C.A., <em>infra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b189-8\">This appellant objects to the absence \u2022of any instruction that such testimony was not to be considered evidence against defendants not directly concerned, combined with the failure of the court to instruct the jury that \u201cthe hearsay testimony\u201d \u201cimproperly admitted against appellant could not be considered.\u201d He does not explain to what \u201chearsay testimony\u201d he refers.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-9\">The emphatic limiting language in the Gourt\u2019s instruction regarding the testimony of Gloria Davis, already quoted in full, adequately protected Darneille\u2019s rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-10\">6. <em>The Appellant Darneille </em>Was <em>Not Denied the Right to Subpoena \u201cNecessary Defense Witnesses\u201d.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b189-11\">The appellant Darneille complains he was \u201cdeprived of his Constitutional rights\u201d because the appellee failed to produce Janet Jones, after a subpoena had been served on George White, head of the Bureau of Narcotics in San Francisco.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-14\">Miss Jones was a special employee of the Bureau of Narcotics who Feldman knew or \u201cassumed\u201d had been involved in \u201cnarcotics traffic\u201d. He also knew that at the time when she was working for the Bureau she was not an addict. Feldman testified that she was supplied to him to give him \u201ccolor\u201d, and that all he \u201cwanted Miss Jones to do was play the part\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-15\">At the time he testified, April 24,1956, Agent Feldman had not seen Miss Jones for about six months, and did not know where she was at that time. She ceased to assist the Bureau on August 1,1955.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-16\">Herbert R. Kessler, attorney, testified that he attempted to serve a subpoena upon Miss Jones by leaving a copy with White, who said he had no idea of her whereabouts, that he had no intention of finding her, and that \u201cshe had worked for him at one time, but because she had taken morphine, marijuana and a goofball at the same time, that she was pretty far out of it and he had to let her go.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b189-17\">Rule 17(d) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b189-18\">\u201cService of a subpoena shall be made by delivering a copy thereof to the person named and by tendering to him the fee for 1 day\u2019s attendance and the mileage allowed by law.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b189-19\">Service of a subpoena on a former employer who plainly says that he has no intention of finding the desired witness, does not meet the requirements of Rule 17(d). Darneille has made no showing that Miss Jones was not available if a search had been made on his behalf, or that any search was in fact made. The appellee was under no obligation to look for the appellant\u2019s witnesses, in the absence of a showing that such witnesses were made unavailable through the suggestion, procurement, or negligence of the appellee.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>In Thomas v. United States, 1946, 81 U.S.App.D.C. 314, 158 F.2d 97, 99, certiorari denied, 1947, 331 U.S. 822, 67 S.Ct. 1303, 91 L.Ed. 1838, the Court observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b190-4\">\u201cAppellant must plead and prove his own case and is responsible for the production in court of witnesses necessary to do so.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b190-5\">Darneille is guilty of a gross misstatement of the record when he states that \u201cCol. White unlawfully refused to comply with the court\u2019s order and informed the appellant that if he did know where she was he would not produce her.\u201d We have already noted that Kes-sler, Darneille\u2019s own witness, testified that White told him that he did not know Miss Jones\u2019s whereabouts and \u201cthat he had no intention of finding her\u201d. The Court\u2019s order was not directed to him, and therefore he could not have refused to comply with it; nor did he say that \u201cif he did know where she was he would not produce her\u201d. It simply was not his duty to <em>look </em>for her.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-6\">The appellant Darneille also asserts that \u201cThere is every reason to believe the government knew of her whereabouts and would have called her as a witness but for fear her testimony would not corroborate that of the agent with whom she was compelled to cooperate\u201d; and \u201cThe fact the U. S. Attorney failed to call her as a witness is evidence of the fact he feared such corroboration of appellant\u2019s contentions\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-7\">Such arguments might be permissible in an address to the jury, but they have no place in a brief in an appellate court. They embody pure speculation.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-8\">In Deaver v. United States, 1946, 81 U.S.App.D.C. 148, 155 F.2d 740, 744, certiorari denied, 1946, 329 U.S. 766, 67 S.Ct. 121, 91 L.Ed. 659, the Court used the following pertinent language:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b190-9\">\u201cWe know of no rule which holds it error for the government to fail to put on the stand a witness, not deemed necessary to its case, who might conceivably have given testimony favorable to the defendant. , <em>It is for the defendant to make his own defense.\u201d </em>[Emphasis supplied.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b190-12\">Finally, Darneille complains that he \u201cwas in jail and not free to search out his witnesses or the government\u2019s.\u201d But the record discloses that he was represented by two attorneys, who seemed alert and zealous in protecting his rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-13\">There is no merit to Darneille\u2019s contention that he \u201cwas denied the right to subpoena the necessary defense witnesses\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-14\">7. <em>The Court\u2019s Instructions Were Adequate.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b190-15\">The three appellants who have filed briefs separately complain of the refusal of the District Court to give an instruction to the effect \u201cthat if a party has stronger or more satisfactory evidence which it could produce and fails, to do so, the jury might infer that it would be adverse to that party\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-16\">The record fails to show that Dar-neille\u2019s counsel submitted any proposed instructions, and he failed to object to the instructions given, as required by Rule 30 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, which Rule frequently has been enforced in recent decisions of this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-17\">Ferrari objected to the Court\u2019s failure to give his requested instruction No. 9, \u201crelating to the suppression by the prosecution of the tapes and the fact that presumption [sic] attaches that they would have been adverse\u201d; and to the failure to give proposed instruction No. 12, \u201cthat if a party has stronger or more satisfactory evidence which is not produced, the jury should distrust the weaker evidence\u201d. He does not set forth in his brief the language \u201ctotidem verbis\u201d of the rejected instructions, nor does he set forth the grounds for his objections in the Court below \u2014 and this latter for the simple reason that he failed to state any grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-18\">Cherpakov sets out in his brief the language of his requested instructions, which was rejected by the Court. That instruction likewise relates to the failure \u201cto produce stronger and more satisfac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>tory evidence\u201d when \u201cit [was] within the power of a party to produce\u201d it. Like Ferrari, Cherpakov has failed to set forth the grounds of the objection \u201curged at the trial\u201d, again for the simple reason that he failed to state the grounds at that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-5\">All three complaining appellants were represented by able counsel in the Court below, and therefore can offer no excuse for the failure to comply with our Rule 18(2) (d), to which reference has already been made in connection with the failure of Darneille to set out the substance of the testimony of Gloria Davis to which objection was made.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-6\">In the first place, Rule 18(2) (d) deals with an appellant\u2019s \u201cSpecification of Errors\u201d. None of the three appellants herein filing briefs has included such a \u201cSpecification\u201d, <em>eo nomine. </em>Ferrari has subdivided his brief into seven parts, with appropriate headings. Cherpakov has divided his main brief into three sections, and Darneille has arranged his opening brief into five \u201cArguments\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-7\">But our foregoing recital demonstrates that even in more substantial respects none of these three appellants has fully complied with Rule 18(2) (d), which reads in pertinent part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ahk4\">\u201c2. This brief shall contain * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b191-8\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b191-9\">\u201c(d) In all cases a specification of errors relied upon which shall be numbered and shall set out separately and particularly each error intended to be urged. When the error alleged is to the admission or rejection of evidence the specification shall quote the grounds urged at the trial for the objection and the full substance of the evidence admitted or rejected, and refer to the page number in the printed or typewritten transcript where the same may be found. When the error alleged is to the charge of the court, the specification shall set out the part referred to totidem verbis, whether it be in instructions given or in instructions refused, together with the grounds of the objections urged at the trial.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b191-11\">We have repeatedly applied Rule 18 (2) (d) in recent decisions of this Court, and no useful purpose would be sub-served by copious citations.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-12\">Cherpakov states that his requested instruction regarding \u201cstronger and more satisfactory evidence\u201d related to the recordings in Feldman\u2019s apartment. Ferrari\u2019s requested instructions were offered in connection with the recordings and also in connection with the testimony of Janet Jones.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-13\">The reasons for the appellee\u2019s inability to produce the witness Janet Jones or the recordings have already been outlined, and need not be rehearsed here.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-14\">Referring to failure to produce evidence as indicating its \u201cunfavorable ten- or\u201d, Professor Wigmore says:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b191-15\">\u201cIt is plain that the inference is based, not on the bare fact that a particular person is not produced as a witness, but on his non-production when it would be natural for him to produce the witness if the facts known by him had been favorable * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b191-16\">\u201c(a) In the first place, the person must be <em>within the power </em>of the party to produce. This is unquestioned.\u201d <footnotemark>6</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b191-17\">While it may be argued that it would have been more prudent to preserve the recordings, the explanation of their unavailability, if believed by the jury, destroys the presumption that the appellants seek to draw. And the verdicts indicate that the jury credited the explanation.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-18\">8. <em>The Court\u2019s Response to a Question Propounded by the Jury Did Not Constitute Reversible Error.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b191-19\">By stipulation, the record on appeal has been augmented as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b192-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>The following note was sent to the District Judge by the jury after it had commenced its deliberations:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-4\">\u201cThe jury would like to know if it would be permissable [sic] to play goverment [sic] recordings in a court if they were available.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A81\">Cherpakov complains that \u201cit is improper to instruct a jury in a [felony] case without notice to counsel and outside the presence of the defendant.\u201d Darneille raises the same question. Ferrari raises it only in his reply brief, which is improper debating. At any rate, Ferrari can hardly complain, since it was <em>his </em>attorney who was selected to confer with the District Judge in chambers, <em>infra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b192-5\">(a) <em>The Manner in Which the Supplementary Instruction Was Given Did Not Violate Any of the Appellants\u2019 Rights.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b192-6\">An affidavit filed by Michael Lewton, counsel for Cherpakov, on May 7, 1956, reads in part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-7\">\u201c * * * the jury commenced their deliberations herein on [May 2, 1956], at approximately 11 * * a.m. * * * That at or about * * * noon of said day, counsel for all the above named defendant * * * were present in the hallway on the third floor of the Post Office Building, * * * San Francisco, * * * immediately outside the courtroom of United States District * * * Judge Edward P. Murphy, * * * before whom this action was tried. * * * the bailiff of said court appeared in said hallway and announced that one of the attorneys representing the defendants was wanted in Judge Murphy\u2019s chambers * * * affiant stated to said bailiff that the attorneys for all defendants were present in said hallway and that all said attorneys would appear in chambers. The Bailiff thereupon stated that only one attorney representing the defendants would be permitted to appear in chambers. [The attorneys for the other appellants] agreed that if only one attorney was to be permitted to appear in chambers, * * * Harry P. Glass-man, Esq., attorney for * * * Ferrari, would be the attorney so to appear,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-15\">\u201c * * * Glassman thereupon went in the chambers of Judge * * * Murphy * * * several minutes thereafter * * * Glass-man * * * emerged from said chambers and informed the attorneys for the other [appellants] * *\u25a0 that the jury had requested an additional instruction on the following subject: That if the tape recordings made by the government agents in the course of their investigation of this case had been available and if they had been offered in evidence, would they have been admitted in evidence * * * the court informed * * * Glassman * * *\u25a0 that the jury would be instructed as follows: That the tape recordings were not available, that they were not offered in evidence, and the jury need not concern itself with whether they would have been admitted in evidence or not.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-20\">\u201c * * * affiant was not informed by any one that additional instructions had been requested by the jury, nor was he informed that-additional instructions had been given to the jury until he was so informed by * * * Glassman * *\u25a0</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-22\"><em>\u201c* </em>* * at all times mentioned herein the attorneys for all other [appellants] * * <em>* </em>were present in said hallway * * * Cherpakov was in the custody of the * * *\u2022 Marshal on the second floor of said Post Office Building * * * the jury was deliberating in the jury room, * * * immediately adjacent to said courtroom [,] [which] was not in use for any other action or proceeding and was available for * * * any proceedings that might be taken in this action.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b192-24\">Glassman filed an affidavit corroborating Lewton, except that he did not indicate the nature of the instruction that, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>the District Judge intended to give, but stated that the Judge said he would reply to the jury\u2019s question by sending to the jury room an instruction in writing. Glassman also deposed that \u201cthe contents of said instructions [sic] were duly noted in the record, and a written copy thereof was sent to the jury in the jury room.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b193-5\">Counsel took no immediate exception to the additional instruction, as required by Rule 30 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, which provides in part that \u201cNo party may assign as error any portion of the charge or omission therefrom unless he objects thereto before the jury retires to consider its verdict, stating distinctly the matter to which he objects and the grounds of his objection.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b193-6\">On May 7, 1956, however, counsel for all the appellants \u201cmade motions for new trial or in the alternative judgments of acquittal\u201d, all of which motions were denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-7\">On the record before us, it was reasonable for the District Judge to assume that Glassman represented all the appellants <em>quoad </em>the conference at which the District Judge announced that the additional instruction would be given. The precise text of that instruction, according to the supplemental record, was as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-8\">\u201cMay 2 \u2014 56</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-9\">\u201cMr. Foreman and Members of the Jury,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-10\">\u201cThe records are unabailable [sic].

Murphy</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AYC\">\u201cUSDJ\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b193-13\">As was said by Judge Sibley in Outlaw v. United States, 5 Cir., 1936, 81 F.2d 805, 809, certiorari denied, 1936, 298 U.S. 665, 56 S.Ct. 747, 80 L.Ed. 1389:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-14\">\u201cIf the jury had been recalled and the charge read to them in appellant\u2019s presence, no different result can be supposed * * * we do not agree that every communication in the constrained absence of the accused necessarily requires a new trial.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b193-19\">In his reply brief, Cherpakov contends that <em>Outlaw </em>in reality \u201cstrongly supports\u201d his position, because of the following language therein:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-20\">\u201cIf the judge in this case had delivered any objectionable or even any new instruction to the jury, we would be prepared to hold that denial of the opportunity to hear it and to take exception to it ought to work a new trial.\u201d '</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b193-21\">In the instant case, the message sent back to the jury by the District Judge was in reality neither an \u201cobjectionable\u201d nor a \u201cnew\u201d instruction at all. The Court simply recited three undisputed facts: namely, that \u201cThe records are unavailable\u201d; that \u201cthey are not in evidence\u201d; and that consequently the jury couldn\u2019t have them. We perceive here no statement of law, either new or objectionable.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-22\">In United States v. Compagna, 2 Cir., 1944, 146 F.2d 524, 528, certiorari denied, 1945, 324 U.S. 867-868, 65 S.Ct. 912, 89 L.Ed. 1422, rehearing denied, 1945, 325 U.S. 892, 65 S.Ct. 1084, 89 L.Ed. 2004, after the jury had been locked up, it sent out a note, asking that certain testimony should be read to them. The judge, who had apparently left the court room, on his way back to it, \u201c \u2018stopped in the jury room and asked them if that is what they meant about that, if they wanted it read\u2019 \u201d. Judge Learned Hand said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-25\">\u201cAs to the visit of the judge, it is true that courts are extremely jealous of anything of the kind, once the jury has been locked up; and we do not wish to abate that jealousy in the least; it is most undesirable that anything should reach a jury which does not do so in the court room. * * * But, like other rules for-the conduct of trials, it is not an end in itself; and, while lapses should be closely scrutinized, when it appears with certainty that no harm <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>has been done, it would be the merest pedantry to insist upon procedural regularity. [Cases cited.] There cannot be the slightest doubt here that the, informality \u2014 for, at most, it was no more \u2014 did not prejudice the accused.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b194-4\">(d) <em>The District Judge Was Correct in His Reply to the Jury\u2019s Question.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b194-5\">The query propounded by the jury was what has been termed an \u201ciffy question\u201d, of a type that one might decline to answer. We think that courts should exercise similar' caution.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-6\">Mr. Chief Justice Hughes counseled judicial reserve in such a situation. In Quercia v. United States, 1933, 289 U.S. 466, 470, 53 S.Ct. 698, 77 L.Ed. 1321, he said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b194-7\">\u201cThe influence of the trial judge on the jury \u2018is necessarily and properly of great weight\u2019 and \u2018his lightest word or intimation is received with deference, and may prove controlling.\u2019 This court has accordingly emphasized the duty of the trial judge to use great care that an expression of opinion upon the evidence \u2018should be so given as not to mislead and especially that it should not be one-sided\u2019; that \u2018deductions and theories not warranted by the evidence should be studiously avoided.\u2019 [Cases cited.] <em>He may not charge the jury \u2018upon a supposed or conjectural state of facts, of which no evidence has been offered.\u2019 \u201d </em>[Case cited.] [Emphasis supplied.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b194-8\">And in Dear Check Quong v. United States, 1947, 82 U.S.App.D.C. 8, 160 F.2d 251, 253, it was said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b194-9\">\u201cAmong the assignments of error is the <em>novel </em>charge that the court erred in refusing to inform the jury that the testimony of the absent informer, <em>had he been present and testified, </em>should have been viewed with suspicion. It appears from the record that the government was unable to produce the informer. <em>An abstract instruction concerning the effect of the testimony he might have given had he been present was properly refused.\u201d </em>[Emphasis supplied.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b194-11\">We are of the view that the Court\u2019s response to the jury\u2019s question regarding the recordings did not constitute reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-12\">9. <em>Conclusion.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b194-13\">We hold that the evidence supported the verdict against each appellant; that the denial of a motion for a mistrial because of newspaper publicity did not constitute an abuse of discretion; that, in the light of the District Court\u2019s cautionary instructions, the testimony of Gloria Davis was admissible to impeach Ferrari; that Darneille was not denied the \u201cright\u201d to subpoena Janet Jones; that the Court\u2019s instructions in general were adequate; and that, in particular, the response of the District Judge to the question propounded by the jury did not reveal reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-14\">Accordingly, each of the four judgments is</p>\n<p id=\"AGGd\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b182-11\">. The appellee erroneously states that \u201cThe remaining [thirteen] counts of the indictment related to two co-defendants, Charles Garcia, Sr., and Charles Clarence Garcia, Jr.,\u201d etc. Garcia, Jr., was not named in Counts 3-15, inclusive. Only Garcia, Sr., was there charged.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b183-11\">. A kilo or kilogram is equivalent to about 2% pounds.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b183-12\">. Feldman seems to be in error regarding the closing date of Ciro\u2019s Bar. In one part of his testimony, he states that he, Miflin, Darneille, and Miss Howard waited \u201cuntil approximately 2 a. m. the morning of the 23rd of July\u201d for Ferrari, and they then \u201cdeparted the bar\u201d and went to Feldman\u2019s apartment. Elsewhere his testimony is as follows: \u201cOn July 22, 1955, at approximately 10 p. m. * * * I returned to Ciro\u2019s for the purpose of seeing Mr. Darneille and some of the present defendants, and when I got to Ciro\u2019s <em>the door was closed. </em>... I was at a loss as to why the place was closed.\u201d If Ciro\u2019s place was locked at 10 p. m. on July 22, why would Feldman and his party wait there for Ferrari until 2 o\u2019clock the next morning? Indeed, how could they get into the bar at all? Perhaps the error is typographical, and Feldman\u2019s return to Ciro\u2019s in quest of Darneille took place at 10 p. m. on July 23.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b188-12\">.
