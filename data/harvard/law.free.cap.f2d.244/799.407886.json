On this record, the question presented for decision was a factual one, and, in an unreported opinion correctly summing up the evidence and resolving the conflicts in it in favor of the mother, the district judge gave, we think, sound reason for his findings and conclusions. Certainly we cannot say his findings were clearly erroneous, nor can we say that, based upon his findings, his conclusions were.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-21\">No purpose would be served by a canvass of the authorities<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> appellant and appellee cite. They unite in declaring that in cases of this kind, where there is a dispute between the beneficiary designated in the policy and one claiming that there has been a change of beneficiary, when the evidence is in conflict, it is for the district judge to resolve the conflicts, and when, as here, he has done so, his decision, unless shown to be clearly erroneous, must stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-22\">The judgment was right. It is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b847-15\">. Some of these are: Mitchell v. United States, 5 Cir., 165 F.2d 758; Collins v. United States, 10 Cir., 161 F.2d 64; Bradley v.
