The District Judge sustained appellee\u2019s motion for summary judgment and dismissed appellant\u2019s complaint for failure of the insured or the appellant to give notice to the appellee of the accident until approximately twenty-three months after the accident and for failure of the insured to cooperate with the insurer. The policy required written notice to be given to the insurer as soon as practicable after the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-28\">For the reasons given by the District Judge in his opinion reported at D.C., 141 F.Supp. 234, and on the basis of the authorities cited therein, the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
