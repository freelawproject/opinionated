The District Court ruled that it was without jurisdiction to grant the relief sought and dismissed the complaint. 139 F.Supp. 690. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-8\">In its excess profits tax returns for the years 1943 and 1944 appellant claimed unused excess profits tax credit carryovers from the years 1941 and 1942, as a result of which it paid less in taxes than would otherwise have been due. Upon final audit of these returns some years later, the Commissioner disallowed a portion of these carryovers, thus determining \u201cdeficiencies\u201d to that extent for the years in question. The Government does not seek to collect those asserted \u201cdeficiencies,\u201d inasmuch as they were abated, if they ever existed, by the application of an excess profits tax credit carryback in 1945.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The Government does, however, claim interest on the alleged \u201cdeficiencies\u201d for the period during which it says there were such \u201cdeficiencies.\u201d Appellant, since it maintains that there never was any \u201cdeficiency,\u201d has resisted the claim for interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-9\">In 1954, the statutes of limitations having been extended by appropriate stipulations, the Government assessed the interest claimed. No notice of deficiency had been mailed. Appellant thereupon commenced this action to restrain collection of the assessment on the ground that Section 272(a) (1) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939 prohibited such an assessment without a prior notice of deficiency. The sole issue before us is whether the procedure set forth in Section 272 is applicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-15\">That section provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b60-16\">\u201cIf in the case of any taxpayer, the Commissioner determines that there is a deficiency in respect of the tax imposed by this chapter, the Commissioner is authorized to send notice of such deficiency to the taxpayer by registered mail. Within ninety days after such notice is mailed * * * the taxpayer may file a petition with the Tax Court of the United States for a redeter-mination of the deficiency. No assessment of a deficiency in respect of the tax imposed by this chapter and no distraint or proceeding in court for its collection shall be made, begun, or prosecuted until such notice has been mailed to the taxpayer, nor until the expiration of such ninety-day period, nor, if a petition has been filed with the Tax Court, until the decision of the Tax Court has become final. * * * \u201d 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 272(a) (1).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b60-18\">Section 272 had its origin in Section 274 of the Revenue Act of 1924, 43 Stat. 297. Before that time taxpayers were not permitted to litigate the correctness of the Commissioner\u2019s determination of tax until they had paid the amount claimed. In that year, the Congress established the Board of Tax Appeals (known since 1942 as the Tax Court) \u201cto provide taxpayers an opportunity to secure an independent review * * * in advance of their paying the tax found by the Commissioner to be due. Before the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>Act of 1924 the taxpayer could only contest the Commissioner\u2019s determination of the amount of the tax after its payment. The Board\u2019s duty under the Act of 1924 was to hear, consider, and decide whether deficiencies reported by the Commissioner were right.\u201d Old Colony Trust Co. v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 279 U.S. 716, 721, 49 S.Ct. 499, 501, 73 L.Ed. 918.</p>\n<p id=\"AEy\">The Tax Court\u2019s jurisdiction under Section 272 is on its face limited to situations in which \u201cthe Commissioner determines there is a deficiency,\u201d and the Tax Court has power only to redetermine such a \u201cdeficiency.\u201d Thus, it has no jurisdiction of questions which relate solely to the assessment of interest. Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. Kilpatrick's Estate, 6 Cir., 140 F.2d 887; United States v. Globe Indemnity Co., 2 Cir., 94 F.2d 576; Standard Portland Cement Co. v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 3 Cir., 80 F.2d 585; Crolich v. United States, D.C., 144 F.Supp. 109; Guaranty Trust Co. of New York v. United States, D.C., 95 F.Supp. 776; Estate of Sloane, 3 T.C.M. 555, 570. Similarly, if prior payment has extinguished the \u201cdeficiency,\u201d there is no jurisdiction in the Tax Court even though this be contrary to the intention of the parties. Bendheim v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 2 Cir., 214 F.2d 26, McConkey v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 4 Cir., 199 F.2d 892; Superheater Co. v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 2 Cir., 125 F.2d 514; Walsh, 21 T.C. 1063; Anderson, 11 T.C. 841. The statutory procedure urged by appellant is applicable of course only where the Tax Court has jurisdiction, smce the deficiency notice procedure was designed only to allow such a determination prior to payment.</p>\n<p id=\"AU\">Two points should be made very clear <em>in limine. </em>First, it is settled that the Government is entitled to interest if the asserted \u201cdeficiencies\u201d did exist for a period of time. Manning v. Seeley Tube &amp; Box Co., 338 U.S. 561, 70 S.Ct. 386, 94 L.Ed. 346. The only dispute in fhe case at bar relates to the proper procedure to be used. Second, the Government does not seek to prevent appellant from litigating the existence of the asserted \u201cdeficiencies.\u201d If the interest is collected under the challenged procedure, appellant will be free to litigate that issue in a suit for refund.</p>\n<p id=\"AkR\">Appellant contends that, despite the fae\u00a3 Gode couehes the Tax Court\u2019s jurisdiction in terms of a present \u201cdeficiency,\u201d the Code as a whole indicates that the Congress meant the Tax Court to have jurisdiction whenever there is a \u201clive\u201d dispute concerning a \u201cdeficiency,\u201d past or present, so long as the taxpayer has not waived recourse to that tribunal. Appellant relies on two propositions, which it says are implicit in the Code: (1) that a taxpayer normally need not pay disputed sums without the opportunity to secure a prior adjudication, and (2) that a taxpayer is entitled to a determination by the Tax Court, irrespective of its right to litigate the issues in controversy in some other federal court, unless it has waived the right. These propositions, while distinct, are necessarily closely interrelated, as the only forum normally available for litigation prior to payment is the Tax Court.</p>\n<p id=\"AqPZ\">The Government contends that appeljard\u2019s claims have been rejected by cases folding that the deficiency notice procedure get forth in Section 272 is inap. piicah&gt;le where the Government is seeking to collect interest on abated \u00abdefi_ dencies\u00bb citing United States v. Koppers Co., 348 U.S. 254, 75 S.Ct. 268, 99 L.Ed. 302; Hastings &amp; Co. v. Smith, 3 Cir., 224 F.2d 875; Rodgers v. United States, 123 Ct.Cl. 779, 108 F.Supp. 727; Cumberland Portland Cement Co. v. United States, D.C., 101 F.Supp. 577, affirmed per curiam 6 Cir., 202 F.2d 152. These cases are not dispositive of this appeal, however, for in each of them the taxpayer admitted the existence of the former \u201cdeficiency\u201d but denied liability for interest on other grounds. Under these circumstances there would have been no point in insisting upon a deficiency notice, since, as noted above, the Tax Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>has no jurisdiction of questions relating solely to interest. But these cases are not totally inapplicable. In each of them the court approved a procedure whereby a taxpayer may be required to pay a disputed sum of interest without an opportunity to secure a prior determination. Thus, these cases are at odds with the first of appellant\u2019s two propositions. Furthermore, Subtitle B of the Code, 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1250 et seq. imposes a host of taxes collectible without an opportunity for prior adjudication. We must conclude, therefore, that the Congress did not intend taxpayers to have a right to a prior adjudication in any and all circumstances. The Congress saw fit to limit this right to cases in which the Commissioner is asserting a present \u201cdeficiency\u201d in respect of certain taxes and we are not at liberty to override that legislative determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-4\">The second of appellant\u2019s propositions is that a taxpayer who has not waived recourse to that tribunal is entitled as of right to secure a Tax Court determination of his contentions relating to the existence of a \u201cdeficiency.\u201d It points out that, even where a jeopardy assessment has been made, specific provision is made to preserve to the taxpayer an opportunity to secure a Tax Court adjudication although there is no present \u201cdeficiency.\u201d Section 273(b). Appellant finds the provision of Section 271(b) \u201ca further indication of Congressional intent to permit taxpayers to avail themselves of the jurisdiction of the Tax Court in all cases except where they waive their rights by voluntary payment in advance.\u201d This section eliminates from consideration in determining \u201cdeficiencies,\u201d required payments of estimated tax.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-5\">But appellant overlooks the provisions of Section 274, which specifically provide for assessment of \u201cdeficiencies\u201d without recourse to the Tax Court following an adjudication of bankruptcy or the appointment of a receiver. Thus, even in this instance of involuntary payment, the Congress has denied the taxpayer access to the Tax Court. In addition, it is undisputed that a mistaken overpayment in one respect will prevent the taxpayer from litigating other questions in the Tax Court if no net \u201cdeficiency\u201d results. It is clear that such a taxpayer has not voluntarily waived the opportunity to litigate in the Tax Court. Moreover, it is inconceivable that the Congress considered the right to litigate in the Tax Court rather than in some other federal court a matter of significance, since it unequivocally denied the opportunity to any taxpayer who promptly paid an asserted \u201cdeficiency.\u201d We do not believe that the Congress meant to discriminate against dutiful taxpayers or that it intended to discourage prompt collection of revenue. We accordingly reject appellant\u2019s second proposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-8\">We find no overriding policy which requires us to depart from the normal rule that the jurisdiction of the Tax Court depends upon the assertion of a present \u201cdeficiency.\u201d As the 1945 carryback precluded the Commissioner from asserting such a \u201cdeficiency,\u201d the Tax Court is without jurisdiction of the dispute in the case at bar. Accordingly it was not necessary for the Commissioner to send appellant a deficiency notice as a condition precedent to assessment of the interest on the asserted former \u201cdeficiencies.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b62-9\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b60-10\">.

Old Colony Trust Co. v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 279 U.S. 716, 721, 49 S.Ct. 499, 73 L.Ed. 918; Everett Knitting Works, 1 B.T.A. 5; Ventura Consolidated Oil Fields v. Rogan, 9 Cir., 86 F.2d 149, certiorari denied 300 U.S. 672, 57 S.Ct. 610, 81 L.Ed. 878. Not only did the optional pro\u2022cedure thus provided enable the taxpayer to litigate the deficiency in advance of payment, but also it a orded other advantages both practical and legal. For instance, a taxpayer mig t occasionally desire a \u00abdetermination by the Tax Court-a tribunal composed of tax specialists \u2014 m preference to a plenary ac- , . , <em>, </em>tion m a district court, especially if the \u201e ,, , , , , ., former were able to act and decide more promptly. Review by the Tax Court might be preferred because there the Commissioner cannot depart from the position taken in his notice of deficiency without assuming the burden of proof, Tauber, 24 T.C. 179, 185; Briggs, 15 T.C.M. 440, 451 (April 16, 1956). More important considerations are that in an action at law on a claim for a refund in the district court the burden is on the taxpayer to disprove every justification \u2022advanced by the Government for retaining the tax payment and that Government claims against the taxpayer, even though barred by the statute of limitations, may be offset against his claim for refund. Lewis v. Reynolds, 284 U.S. 281, 52 S.Ct. 145, 76 L.Ed. 293; United States v. Pfister, 8 Cir., 205 F.2d 538. The very fact that \u00a7 272(a) (1) expressly gives the taxpayer a right to enjoin assessment and collection until he has been given the prescribed opportunity for a redetermination by the Tax Court, shows that Congress considered the right important. Its importance is further attested by the legislative care to provide opportunity for a redetermination by the Tax Court even in cases of jeopardy assessments under \u00a7 273(b) and (c).</p>\n<p id=\"Apa\">The defendant-collector argues<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> that a taxpayer\u2019s access to the Tax Court under \u00a7 272 dependg literhUy upon the existence of the stated condition, viz.: adetermination by the Commissioner \u201cthat there <em>is </em>a deficiency,\u2019\u2019-that is to say, a deficjency jn existence when the determinat\u00edon ig made; ^ if the Commissioner deferg Wg determination until a once_ ... \u201e . , ,, , , ,. existing deficiency shall have been elim- , mated by the accrual of a carry-back \u201e _ , \u2022 . , under \u00a7 710 of the Code as amended, the result 18 that \u00a7 272 18 no lon\u00aber aP\" Plicable and the taxpayer can challenge a determination of the deficiency which, although discharged by a carry-back, gave rise to a continuing liability for interest, only by paying the interest assessed and then suing in the district court for its recovery.^ In other words, the defendant maintains that although \u00a7 272 entitles a taxpayer to a redetermination by the Tax Court of a disputed deficiency for the purpose of assessing and collecting the principal amount of a tax deficiency, it does not entitle him to a redetermination for the purpose of assessing and collecting interest on a disputed tax deficiency. My brothers seem to have accepted this contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>With this thesis I am unable to agree. Section 272(a) of the 1939 Code derives from \u00a7 274 of the Act of 1924 and first appeared in its present form in \u00a7 272 of the Act of May 28, 1938, c. 289, 52 Stat. 535. In 1938, there was no provision under then existing tax law for a carry-back the effect of which might be to discharge or abate an existing deficiency: under the structure of that tax law as it then existed <em>every </em>deficiency in the tax reported, unless voluntarily reported and paid by the taxpayer, continued in existence until determined by the Commissioner. Consequently, under the Act of 1938 \u2014 as also under the Code of 1939 \u2014 \u00a7 272 was intended to apply, and literally did apply, to every deficiency determined by the Commissioner: the taxpayer at his option could utilize the \u00a7 272 procedure to obtain a redetermination of each and every deficiency in the tax law which the Commissioner was authorized to determine.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-4\">When the device of the carry-back was introduced into the structure of the income and excess profits tax law by the Revenue Act of 1942,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the obvious purpose was to provide for the reduction of the taxpayer\u2019s tax liability and thus to reduce or abate any possible or asserted deficiency which might otherwise be determined, \u2014 not to rescind or modify the taxpayer's rights under \u00a7 272 to a re-determination <em>of disputed deficiencies. </em>There is no Congressional history to show, and no conceivable reason to suggest, an intent to exclude from the \u00a7 272 review, which had been provided for every deficiency, deficiencies which, if they ever existed, had been abated by a carry-back accrued prior to the determination of the deficiency. Under \u00a7 292 of the Code, interest on a tax deficiency accrues as an integral part of the tax liability: interest and principal are assessed and collected at the same time and by the same procedure. An authoritative determination of a deficiency is a prerequisite to the accrual of the taxpayer\u2019s liability not only for the principal of the deficiency but also for interest thereon. If a taxpayer is entitled to a redeter-mination by the Tax Court of the Commissioner\u2019s determination of an existing deficiency prior to the assessment of the deficiency and of interest thereon, I think he is equally entitled to such a redetermination of a disputed deficiency, which \u2014 if it ever did exist \u2014 had been abated as a result of a carry-back, prior to the assessment of interest thereon. Otherwise a semantic accident operates to frustrate the legislative objective.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-7\">Although, as my brothers have noted, the procedure provided in \u00a7 274 for the liquidation of claims against bankrupt taxpayers is somewhat different from that generally provided for the determination of deficiencies, I am unable to see how that difference strengthens the defendant\u2019s position. Surely the fact that in a bankruptcy case the <em>Commissioner must prove </em>his claim in the bankruptcy court thus entitling the taxpayer to an adjudication <em>in advance of payment, </em>as \u00a7 274 provides, does not suggest that a solvent taxpayer may <em>not </em>petition the Tax Court for a final determination of a deficiency <em>in advance of payment.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b64-8\">The cases cited by the Government, and indeed those cited by my brothers, seem to me not to justify the dismissal below. It will serve no useful purpose to analyze these cases individually. In some, as the majority opinion notes, \u201cthe court approved a procedure whereby a taxpayer may be required to pay a disputed sum of interest without an opportunity to secure a prior determination.\u201d But in none of these cases was the dispute as to interest an underlying and consistently maintained dispute as to the validity of the Commissioner\u2019s determination of the deficiency upon which the claim of interest depended.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-9\">I would hold that for failure to comply with the procedure prescribed by \u00a7 272 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>there has been no valid assessment. The fact that the statute of limitations has run so that it is now too late for the Commissioner to make an enforceable assessment after compliance with \u00a7 272, is of course not a pertinent consideration. I would reverse in order that the appellant might have the injunctive relief under \u00a7 272 to which \u2014 as I believe\u2014 it is entitled.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b62-6\">. All references in this opinion to statutory sections and titles are to the Internal Revenue Code of 1939, unless otherwise indicated.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"Afj\"><em>. </em>Section 272 by its express terms is applicable to taxes \u201cimposed by this chapter,\u201d i. e., Chapter 1 of Subtitle A, which includes income and excess profits taxes. That it is not applicable to the comparatively simple miscellaneous taxes imposed under Subtitle B of the Code is a fact which, though noted in the majority \u2022opinion, 1 find of no pertinence to the problem presented by this appeal which involves a disputed deficiency asserted \u25a0under the complex provisions of the law imposing excess profits taxes.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"AVZ\">.
