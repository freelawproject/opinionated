It appears that Hill had previously exhausted his remedies under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. The District Court granted him leave to file a notice of appeal in forma pauperis, but denied him leave to proceed further as a poor person, certifying that the appeal is without merit and not taken in good faith.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-21\">Title 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(a), which authorizes proceedings in forma pauperis on appeal, provides that \u201cAn appeal may not be taken in forma pauperis if the trial court certifies in writing that it is not taken in good faith.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b359-22\">There is no showing that the certification of the trial court in this case was not made in good faith or that it was unwarranted. See Wells v. United States, 318 U.S. 257, 259, 63 S.Ct. 582, 87 L.Ed. 746. In fact, the files and records of the District Court, which we have examined, demonstrate the contrary, and disclose that Hill has had his full day in court.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-23\">In support of his petition, Hill cites Johnson v. United States, 352 U.S. 565, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>77 S.Ct. 550, 1 L.Ed.2d 593. That case \u00eds inapplicable to his situation, since he is not seeking to appeal in forma pauperis from a judgment of conviction, but is attempting to have vacated the sentence under which he is in custody, an d from which he did not appeal. See and compare Gershon v. United States, 8 Cir., 243 F.2d 527.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-3\">The petition of Hill for leave to proceed in forma pauperis on appeal is denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
