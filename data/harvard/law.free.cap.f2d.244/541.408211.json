But these are without merit. Evidence of weekly and other substantial receipts from his employers as claimed \u201cexpense\u201d money was directly admissible as an integral part of the plaintiff\u2019s case, since the size, amount, and circumstances of these receipts were sufficient to permit the jury to believe that payments by way of compensation were included. The prosecution did not have to prove specific amounts, and the defendant made no attempt to disclose that he spent these sums or any part for the benefit of his employers. And evidence of similar omissions to file a return in six prior years is relevant on the issue of his intent; the multiplication of instances tends to negative any element of innocent intent. 2 Wigmore on Evidence \u00a7 302, p. 196 (3d Ed.1940); United States v. Brand, 2 Cir., 79 F.2d 605, 606, certiorari denied Brand v. United States, 296 U.S. 655, 56 S.Ct. 381, 80 L.Ed. 466.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-22\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
