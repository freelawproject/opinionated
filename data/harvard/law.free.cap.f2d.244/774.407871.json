Twenty-seven months elapsed from the final administrative action on June 18, 1953 to the time of the initiation of the instant litigation. An earlier suit appellant had filed in Minnesota had been dismissed on jurisdictional grounds May 14, 1954; but almost sixteen additional months passed before the present litigation was initiated in this jurisdiction September 2, 1955. Appellant sought to meet the defense of laches only by explaining that the delay was due to his efforts to obtain an attorney in the District of Columbia. Considering the time consumed in the fruitless earlier suit, we think the diligence required of appellant, himself a lawyer, would have avoided a substantial part of this additional delay. Because of appellant\u2019s laches alone, the judgment for appellees will be affirmed. See Arant v. Lane, 249 U.S. 367, 372, 39 S.Ct. 293, 63 L.Ed. 650; Caswell v. Morgenthau, 69 App.D.C. 15, 98 F.2d 296; Grasse v. Snyder, 89 U.S.App.D.C. 352, 192 F.2d 35; Haas v. Overholser, 96 U.S.App.D.C. 22, 223 F.2d 314. Cf. Gurley v.

Section 12 of the Veterans\u2019 Preference Act, 58 Stat. 390 (1944), as amended, 5 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 861. Though appellant\u2019s total length of service exceeded that of the retained employee by more than three months the regulations created a tie with respect to length of service and then broke it in favor of the other employee because he had entered the employment of the particular agency two days before appellant.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
