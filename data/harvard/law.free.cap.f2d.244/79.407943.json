The petitioner was on an accrual method of accounting.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-22\">It appears from the carefully consid-, ered opinion of the tax court that, at the end of the year 1950, the petitioner\u2019s liability to make refunds to consumers had been, for all practical purposes, ascertained; and that the electors had approved a 1950 ordinance of the City of Columbus, Ohio, which had been accepted previously by the petitioner. It appears further that the possibility of a disturbance by the Utility Commission of Ohio of the rate agreement between the petitioner and the City of Columbus in the 1950 ordinance, adopted by the city and confirmed by its voters, was too remote <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>to preclude the accrual in 1950 of the resultant refund under the settlement agreement of the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-4\">The decision of the tax court accordingly is affirmed upon the basis of the reasoning in that court\u2019s opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
