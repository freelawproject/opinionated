On January 23, 1948, the vessel was tied up at a lock in the Ohio River. At 5:20 p.m. the same day, Swain was observed boarding-her. There was evidence that the ship\u2019s cook reported to the captain that Swain was argumentative and intoxicated. The captain himself ate dinner with Swain and conversed with him. Pie testified that he smelled liquor on decedent\u2019s, breath and observed him, in the words-of the district court, \u201cunder the influence of alcohol to a slight degree.\u201d Decedent Swain was last seen alive in the dining room. A subsequent search of the vessel proved fruitless, and his body was discovered some months later in the Ohio River, the victim of drowning. This suit, brought under the Jones Act, 46 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 688, and tried to the district court without a jury, is predicated on the allegation that the captain\u2019s negligence in failing to examine decedent and otherwise care for Swain as his ward was the proximate cause of Swain\u2019s death. Aside from the question of the captain\u2019s duty under these circumstances, the district court made the following finding of fact:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b870-12\">\u201cThere is no evidence to indicate that the decedent\u2019s condition was the proximate cause of his death.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A1U\">This finding was certainly a permissible inference under the circumstances. The record before us is devoid of any evidence of a causal conection between; decedent\u2019s condition and his death, and-oral argument did not indicate that, there was such evidence. We are unable to say, therefore, that the district, court\u2019s finding was clearly erroneous,, or that we are left with any firm impression that it was wrong.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-13\">The judgment of the district court, will be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
