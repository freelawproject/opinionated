After completion of the testimony, counsel for defendant requested the trial court to charge the jury to the effect that, if the Government failed to prove each element of the offenses beyond a reasonable doubt, the jury should find the defendant not guilty. The court failed or refused so to charge. Nor did its instructions, as a whole, contain the substance of the request.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-12\">The giving of such a charge should be uniform practice. We think that, certainly in every case where such a charge is requested, failure so to charge, directly or in substance, is reversible error. Cf. Williams v. United States, 76 U.S.App.D.C. 299, 131 F.2d 21; McAffee v. United States, 70 App.D.C. 142, 105 F.2d 21.</p>\n<p id=\"AI3\">Reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
