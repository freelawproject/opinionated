Thompson v. Magnolia Petroleum Co., 1940, 309 U.S. 478, 481, 60 S.Ct. 628, 84 L.Ed. 876; In re Prokop, 7 Cir., 1933, 65 F.2d 628.</p>\n<p id=\"A0b\"> The court was also correct in concluding that under Michigan law appellant\u2019s security interest was not a conditional sale contract, but a chattel mortgage, which was invalid against the trustee in bankruptcy because an intervening creditor had extended credit to the bankrupt after the instrument was executed and before it was recorded.
