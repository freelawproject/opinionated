Such rubber is made by the copolymerization of various monomers, in this case a conjugated diolefin and another polymeriza-ble comonomer. The two materials specified in claim 26, supra, are butadiene and styrene. They are polymerized together in an emulsion wherein long chain molecules are formed, characteristic of rubber-like materials. The references disclose that this type of synthetic rubber, known as \u201cGR-S\u201d was made during the war at a standard polymerization temperature of 122\u00b0F. At a later date processes were developed for carrying out the polymerization at much lower temperatures, sometimes referred to as refrigerated polymerization. Temperatures given in the references are 41\u00b0F., 14\u00b0F., 0\u00b0F. and 5\u00b0, 2\u00b0 and -18\u00b0C. All of these temperatures, it will be seen, are within the claims which, in effect, call for a cold rubber process in which there is no novelty <em>per se. </em>Cold rubber has been found to possess certain advantages. As is stated in Ind. &amp; Eng. Chem. (2), (1949), \u201cThe field of low temperature-polymerized latex is in a state of rapid development * * * There are many areas yet to be investigated in the refrigerated latex field.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b369-14\">(b) The claims call for the production of a polymer which has a \u201craw Mooney value (ML-4) of at least 90\u201d. This may be explained by quoting appellants\u2019 brief:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-15\">\u201c * * * This raw Mooney value is essentially a measure of the toughness and processability of the synthetic rubber material. On one hand, the defined Mooney value of 90 or higher represents a rubber which is quite tough and difficult to process, as compared to conventional rubbers which have Mooney values ranging from 50 to 65. On the other hand, polymers having a high Mooney value of 90 or over excel in certain important physical properties, such as tensile strength and percentage elongation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-16\">\u201cThe phrase \u2018ML-4\u2019 designates a particular test used in determining the Mooney value of the rubber wherein a large 1% inch diameter rotor is used in conjunction with a test time of four minutes, the test being conducted by placing the material between the rotor and two stationary parts provided with an array of sharp points to hold the rubber. As the rotor turns, the rubber exerts an opposing torque which is measured, and the shearing strength is determined.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b369-17\">This is not a novel feature of the process since the references disclose a wide range <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>of cold rubber Mooney (ML-4) values, as high as 140. What appellants have to say on this point, after the explanation quoted above is this:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-4\">\u201cIn appellants\u2019 claimed combination, the product has the desirable physical properties associated with tough high Mooney synthetic rubber, but the material is still not too tough to process because of the addition of the softener ingredient, and actually is unexpectedly superi- or in heat build-up as has been previously explained.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b370-5\">Heat build-up means temperature rise in a sample when repeatedly flexed. It is obviously advantageous in some rubber uses, tires for example, to have low heat build-up.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-6\">The examiner was not persuaded by appellants\u2019 test results, as set forth in the specification, that there was any surprising or unexpectedly superior improvement in heat build-up characteristics from this invention. Neither was the board. We are of the same opinion. This is the one alleged advantage on which appellants place the most weight in their arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-7\">(c) The use of hydrocarbon softeners in cold rubber is clearly disclosed by Ind. &amp; Eng. Chem. (1), an article devoted to the subject of cold rubber. It specifically names several hydrocarbon softeners in cold rubber formulae. This is, therefore, a type of softener for this type of rubber which is clearly taught by the prior art.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-8\">The claims call for the addition of the softener to the latex as a dispersion in water. The prior art of record discloses two generally recognized ways of adding compounding ingredients to synthetic rubber, softener being such an ingredient. One is to add them to the rubber while it is being worked on a roll mill and the other is to add them to the latex, prior to the coagulation and milling steps, in the form-of an aqueous dispersion. Appellants elected to use, and to claim, the latter well known procedure. 'Clearly, there is nothing in step (c) which is novel. Rubber Age (2) describes \u201cLatex Compounding of GR-S\u201d even before the development of cold rubber as a desirable expedient.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-10\">(d) Finally, there is the matter of the quantity of softener, 15 to 50 parts by weight per 100 parts by weight of rubber. Ind. &amp; Eng. Chem. (1) says (p. 771), \u201cIn order to make high Mooney rubbers processable, it is necessary either to add softeners or to give the rubber mechanical treatment.\u201d And again, \u201cIncreasing the Mooney value of the raw polymer does not improve the abrasion resistance if sufficient softener is added * * And, in specific examples, it gives 10 parts of softener. Added to this is the teaching of the Sar-bach patent which discloses \u201ca new class of softeners for synthetic rubber.\u201d One such rubber mentioned in the patent is a copolymer of butadiene and styrene, the same as appellants\u2019 except for the fact it is not made by cold polymerization, a process not yet developed when the patent application was filed. It contains this teaching for the synthetic rubber art:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-12\">\u201cThe amount of the softener added will depend upon the properties desired in the composition and' upon the nature of the rubber treated, the rubber and the softener being compatible over a wide range of proportions. In commercial operations it will ordinarily be expedient to employ from about 10 to 60 parts by weight of the softener for each 100 parts of synthetic rubber but amounts smaller or larger than this ranging from 1 to 100 parts of softener for 100 parts of synthetic rubber are also effective.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b370-13\">Apropos of element (c) of the claim, the patent also suggests that \u201cadding the softener to an emulsion or dispersion of the synthetic rubber\u201d (i. e. to rubber latex) is a desirable way to incorporate it.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-14\">Appellants lay great stress on the <em>combination </em>aspect of their claimed invention and the \u201cconcert of action\u201d and \u201ccooperative relationship\u201d which exist <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>between the four limitations discussed above, (a) to (d). It is their contention that even if each element is old <em>per se, </em>it was patentable invention to assemble this particular group of elements. They also complain of the rejection on five references no one of which teaches the entire combination.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-5\">Our view on these points, having read all of the references carefully, as a worker in the art must be presumed to have done, is that steps (a) and (b) amount to no more than the selection of existing \u201ccold rubbers\u201d having a Mooney value (ML-4) above 90 and that steps (e) and (d) amount merely to a determination of the range of known softeners to be added, and the best of two recognized ways of adding them, to obtain whatever results may be desired. If the skilled worker in the art is attempting to obtain optimum heat build-up, he would as a routine matter select the combination of rubber, softener and method of addition to produce it. That experimentation would be required to find that combination, in which of course all factors cooperate or act in concert, does not make the result patentable where, as here, it clearly follows the suggestions of the prior art.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-6\">In view of the teachings of the references and the level of knowledge they indicate is to be expected of the \u201cperson having ordinary skill in the art\u201d (35 U.S.C. \u00a7 103) with respect to how much softener to add to synthetic rubber, by whatever process made, and how to add it, we are of the opinion that the alleged invention claimed is in the realm of the obvious.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-7\">The decision of the Board of Appeals is therfore affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-8\">Affirmed.</p>\n<author id=\"b371-9\">O\u2019CONNELL, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AHqN\">because of illness, was not present at the argument of this case and did not participate in the decision.</p>\n<author id=\"b371-10\">JACKSON, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"aqb-dedup-1\">retired, recalled to participate herein in place of COLE, J., absent because of illness.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
