United States ex rel. Carson, 77 S.Ct. 1022, the Supreme Court disapproved the decision and reversed the judgment in the Carson case. The decision of the district court in this case is accordingly disapproved, its judgment is reversed, and the cause is remanded for further and not inconsistent proceedings.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
