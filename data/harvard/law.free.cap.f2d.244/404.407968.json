Turner is one of the group known as \u201cJehovah\u2019s Witnesses.\u201d Having served for ten months at the Auburn Memorial Hospital, in Auburn, New York, after his classification as a conscientious objector, which service was terminated, he was later directed to serve the balance of his term of service <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>of twenty-four months at Hudson River State Hospital, in Poughkeepsie, New York. It is not disputed that he wilfully and knowingly failed and refused to comply with this direction; and for this refusal he has been convicted of a violation of the Universal Military Training and Service Act, \u00a7 12, 50 U.S.C.A.Appendix, \u00a7 462, and sentenced to eighteen months imprisonment and the payment of a fine of $1,000. The principal issue raised on this appeal is the legality of the direction that he report at Pough-keepsie. The substance of his claim is that this direction was not made by his local board but was contained in a letter from the New York State Director of Selective Service.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-4\">As appellant\u2019s claim is a technical one, we think a full statement of the factual background will make it easier to understand the interrelation of the various applicable statutes and regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-5\">Appellant, a resident of Syracuse, New York, was born on February 18, 1933; he is a registrant with local board No. 58 in Syracuse; and in due course received and filled out SSS Form 150, which led to his classification I-O, as a conscientious objector, on January 8, 1952. He reported for physical examination on February 3, 1953, and was found acceptable although suffering from a hernia.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-6\">On February 20, 1953, the local board mailed to appellant SSS Form 152, entitled \u201cSpecial Report for Class 1-0 Registrants,\u201d which required appellant to submit three types of work that he was qualified to perform. He failed to do this but merely wrote in answer to the questions relative to the three types of work: \u201cTo serve Almighty God with all my heart and soul.\u201d He was directed by the local board, however, to report to the New York State Employment Office for the purpose of determining his qualifications for civilian work, and the upshot of his interview was that employment in the Hospital of the Good Shepherd in Syracuse was offered and he accepted; but the actual assignment was deferred pending an operation to cure the hernia. After the operation the surgeon reported that appellant was physically fit to commence work on July 14,1953.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-9\">The New York State Employment Service advised the local board on August 21, 1953, that it expected to place appellant in Auburn Memorial Hospital within a week; and in fact he reported for work and commenced his employment at Auburn Memorial Hospital, 5-19 Lansing Street, Auburn, New York, on August 31, 1953. Accordingly, on September 18, 1953, appellant\u2019s local board issued to him the following order, on SSS Form 153, which is the basic order, and appellant\u2019s conviction is the result of his wilful failure to comply with the terms thereof:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b453-10\">\u201cSelective Service System \u201cOrder to Report for Civilian Work and Statement of Employer \u201c[Selective Service]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b453-11\">\u201c[System Seal]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b453-12\">\u201cSept. 18, 1953</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"axe-dedup-0\">\u201cAllen D.

F. Harrienger,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"an3-dedup-0\">\u201cPersonnel Director\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b454-9\">On October 6, 1953, his local board classified appellant I-W, to signify that he was a conscientious objector performing civilian work.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-10\">On July 9, 1954, Auburn Memorial Hospital informed the local board that appellant\u2019s employment with the hospital had terminated on July 4, 1954, under circumstances casting no reflection upon appellant\u2019s character. He had served ten months of the required period of twenty-four.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-11\">The New York State Director for Selective Service, when notified of the termination of the original work assignment, advised appellant of various employment opportunities elsewhere as well as of appellant\u2019s obligation to seek such, and that he would be subject to assignment by the State Director if he failed to find employment himself. But appellant disregarded these various communications.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-12\">Accordingly, in a letter dated February 4, 1955, which appellant received in Syracuse, the State Director wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A7R\">\u201cSince your services at the Auburn Memorial Hospital were terminated before you had completed the required 24 months, you are hereby directed to report to Mr. Joyce at the Hudson River State Hospital, Poughkeepsie, New York, on Wednesday, February 16, 1955 at 8:30 A.M. for hospital work.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b454-16\">The objection to venue in the Southern District of New York is wholly without merit, unless it be assumed that appellant\u2019s failure to report at the Hudson River State Hospital in Poughkeepsie, which is within the territorial limits of the Southern District of New York, was not a failure and refusal to obey a lawful order of his local board. The point was settled by the decision in Johnston v. United States, 351 U.S. 215, 76 S.Ct. 739, 742, 100 L.Ed. 1097, that \u201cwhere the crime charged is the failure to do a legally required act, the place fixed for its performance fixes the situs of the crime.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b454-17\">Nor do certain criticisms of the form of the local board\u2019s \u201cOrder to Report for Civilian Work,\u201d dated September 18, 1953, warrant extended comment. The printed words \u201clocal board named above\u201d were x-ed out, and over them was typewritten in, \u201cAuburn City Memorial Hospital, Auburn, N. Y.,\u201d where appellant was ordered to report on September 28, 1953. We are told that 32 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 1606.51 and 1606.52 require the use of official forms, which must not be altered; that the regular procedure required that appellant be ordered to report to the local board, there to receive \u201cinstructions to proceed to the place of employment\u201d; and that the insertion of the name and address of the hospital and the deletion of the words \u201clocal board named above\u201d nullified the order. Indeed, the point is developed with considerable proliferation. It is asserted that everything depends upon the \u201cfirst step,\u201d which is said to be reporting at the local board; and it is further claimed that a similar reporting at the board was an essential preliminary and jurisdictional prerequisite to the giving of any direction to report at the Poughkeepsie hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-18\">We think these refinements wholly at variance with the scheme of the statute and the regulations. No essential or jurisdictional \u201cstep\u201d was omitted; ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>pellant had already voluntarily reported at the hospital in Auburn and was at work there before the order of September 18,1953, was made.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-4\">This brings us to the crux of the case. The order of September 18, 1953, commanded appellant \u201cto remain in employment for twenty-four (24) consecutive months or until such time as you are released or transferred by proper authority\u201d; and the last paragraph of the order informed appellant that his failure \u201cto remain in this employment the specified time will constitute a violation of the Universal Military Training and Service Act, as amended, which is punishable by fine or imprisonment or both.\u201d Was appellant\u2019s failure to obey the direction of the State Director to report at the hospital in Poughkeepsie a wilful refusal to comply with the order of the local board of September 18, 1953?</p>\n<p id=\"b455-5\">A careful examination of the underlying statute and the regulations promulgated pursuant to the authority conferred thereby has convinced us that it is the function of the local board to determine the type of civilian work to be performed by a registrant who has been classified 1-0 and to order the registrant to perform that work in lieu of induction into the armed forces; thereafter it is the function of the State Director to implement the order of the local board by seeing to it that the registrant performs for the requisite period the work he has been ordered by the local board to do. The legal <em>effect </em>of appellant\u2019s failure to obey the direction of the State Director to report to the hospital at Poughkeepsie was a refusal to comply with the order of the local board which determined the type of civilian work to be done and ordered appellant to do it.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-6\">The Congress has authorized the President \u201cto prescribe the necessary rules and regulations to carry out the provisions\u201d of the Act [50 U.S.C.A.Appendix, \u00a7 460(b) (1)], and to appoint a Director of Selective Service [50 U.S. C.A.Appendix, \u00a7 460(a) (3)] and a State Director for Selective Service in each state of the Union [50 U.S.C.A. Appendix, \u00a7 460(b) (2)]. Pursuant to such authority the Regulations were prescribed and the Director was given power to \u201cissue such public notices, orders, and instructions as shall be necessary for carrying out the functions of the Selective Service System.\u201d 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 1604.1(b). Each State Director has similar authority, subject to the direction of the Director. 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 1604.12. Elaborate provisions were made to assure that conscientious objectors be given fair treatment, and at the same time carry a proper share of the burdens of citizenship.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-10\">True it is that the heading of 32 C.F. R. \u00a7 1660.21 reads, \u201cGeneral provisions relative to orders by the local boards to perform civilian work and performance of civilian work,\u201d but this taken together with the text of the Regulations makes it clear that the language is carefully chosen. The only reference to the local board is to the local board\u2019s order to report for civilian work. Section 1660.21 merely provides that \u201cthe registrant shall be ordered to perform the same type of work with another employer\u201d; and the phraseology of SSS Form 153 refers to a transfer \u201cby proper authority.\u201d That the direction to transfer as well as the general supervision of compliance by the registrant with the initial order of the local board are functions of the State Director, as held by Judge Noonan, is clear to us from the unambiguous and pertinent provision of Section 1660.31 of the Regulations:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b455-11\">\u201cIt shall be the responsibility of such State Director of Selective Service to see that the registrant performs the work to which he has been ordered by the local board for a period of twenty-four consecutive months, unless sooner released under the provisions of Section 1660.21.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b455-12\">We hold that the State Director by making a reassignment such as the one before us here is not usurping a function, reserved to the local board; he is exercising the authority prescribed by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>Section 1604.12, carrying out the duty imposed upon him by Section 1660.31, and implementing the original order of the local board assigning the registrant to civilian work.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
