Its income tax returns for the years in question contained understatements of gross income of more than twenty-five per cent resulting from an erroneous overstatement of the basis 'of land sold, rather than from any omission of gross receipts. Under these circumstances it is the petitioner\u2019s contention that the general three-year limitation p\u00e9\u2019ri\u00f3d of section 275(a) of the 1939 'Code- is applicable. As petitioner\u2019s counsel correctly points out, the decisions of 'the Courts of Appeals of several other \"circuits give clear support to this view. Uptegrove Lumber Co. v. Commissioner, 3 Cir., 1953, 204 F.2d 570; Deakman-Wells Co. v. Commissioner, 3 Cir., 1954, 213 F.2d 894; Goodenow v. Commissioner, 8 Cir., 1956, 238 F.2d 20; cf. Slaff v. Commissioner, 9 Cir., 1955, 220 F.2d 65; Davis v. Hightower, 5 Cir., 1956, 230 F.2d 549.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-6\">The reasoning of these cases is not without considerable persuasive force, and if the question were here for the first time, we might be disposed to follow them. However, the question has already been decided by this court in Reis v. Commissioner, 6 Cir., 1944, 142 F.2d 900, where it was held that the five-year limitation was applicable when the taxpayer\u2019s understatement of gross income of inor\u00e9 than twenty-five per cent was the result of his overstatement of the cost basis of property sold. The facts in the !Reis, case. ar.e, of course, not identical with the facts in the present case, but the issue presented is the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-7\">\u2018 Upon the authority of Reis v. Commissioner. the decision of the Tax Court is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b124-8\">. \u201c(c) Omission from gross income. If f \u00a1the taxpayer omits from gross income an amount properly includible therein which is in excess Of '25 per centum of the amount of gross income stated in the return, the tax may be assessed, or a proceeding in court for the collection of such tax may be begun without assessment, at any time within 5 years after the return was filed.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
