Appellant in his brief noted that he was pursuing the interrogation \u201caccording to suggestions\" contained in an attached legal article which stated that such questioning was \u201ca matter of psychological propaganda technique\u201d to highlight in a juror\u2019s mind at the outset certain contentions of the questioner.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b73-10\">John R. BROWN, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b73-11\">From a judgment entered on a jury verdict for defendant, plaintiff-appellant is here seeking reversal for a new trial to recover for personal injuries suffered in an automobile-child pedestrian accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-12\">Driving north on State Road 231, the \u25a0defendant driver approached the small community of Hiland Park, Florida, about noon of July 22, 1955. To his left was the grouping of service stations, houses, and stores comprising the \u201cbusiness section\u201d of the community. To his right, paralleling the highway was a railroad track and, still farther over, several houses partially concealed by trees. The \u25a0day was bright and clear; the highway dry. As defendant driver drew near the mid-point of the community, Yancey Kirby Strickland, a child of five years and ten months, suddenly ran \u201cjust as fast he could go with his head down\u201d and \u201clike the devil himself was after him * * * \u201d from the door of his grandfather\u2019s combination store and service station into the path of the automobile and was struck by its left front fender. Yancey suffered a fracture of the skull and right thigh and multiple contusions and abrasions. Residing as he did in one of the houses located across the highway and railroad track, the boy frequently crossed the highway at this point to reach a path leading to his home.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-15\"> Appellant\u2019s contention that the verdict is without sufficient supporting record evidence, if a claim that as a matter of law a verdict for the plaintiff would alone be warranted, fails for want of a motion for directed verdict. Boudreaux v. Mississippi Shipping Company, 5 Cir., 222 F.2d 954; Baten v. Kirby Lumber Corp., 5 Cir., 103 F.2d 272; Moore, Federal Practice (2d ed.) \u00a7 50.05 [1]. And if asserted as a claim that we should overlook that procedural defect or reverse for failure of the trial court to grant a new trial because it was against the weight of the evidence likewise fails for want of demonstration that this was an error of law by abuse of the Court\u2019s discretion. See Kirby Lumber Corporation v. Laird, 5 Cir., 231 F.2d 812; Commercial Credit Corp. v. Pepper, 5 Cir., 187 F.2d 71.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-16\">The remaining alleged errors relate to procedural and evidentiary matters and rulings on instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-17\">With no record at all made of voir dire examination of the jury panel, no abusive exercise of the trial court\u2019s discretion, Bass v. Dehner, 10 Cir., 103 F.2d 28, certiorari denied 308 U.S. 580, 60 S.Ct. 100, 84 L.Ed. 486; 5 Moore\u2019s Federal Practice \u00a7 4706, in limiting counsel\u2019s inquiry is shown. Moreover, the manifest,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> but unpermissible, purpose of the examination was to \u201ccondition\u201d the prospective jurors by placing before them certain of the plaintiff\u2019s conten<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>tions of fact and law, rather than to inquire into the competency and qualifications of the prospective jurors. 50 C.J.S., Juries, \u00a7 273 a. The related complaint of the Court\u2019s action respecting two somewhat similar questions asked of defendant-driver on cross examination stands no better in demonstrating any harmful effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-4\">The trial court\u2019s refusal to give five requested charges resulted, according to appellant, in unduly minimizing the responsibility imposed by law on the motorist. Of the requested and refused charges, the subject matter was either completely and adequately covered in the fair and balanced charge, or was not applicable<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> to this fact situation.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-5\">While it appears that the Court\u2019s own question to, and the answer of, an investigating highway patrolman<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> was error under Florida law<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> in revealing that after the accident no driver violations were preferred, if harmful effect occurred, Fed.Rules Civ.Proc. rule 61, 28 U.S.C.A., it was not from this, but from the plaintiff's subsequent actions magnifying it. For, unlike a situation in which, with adverse ruling, a party is entitled further to examine without waiving objection to the Court\u2019s earlier ruling of exclusion or admission, 3 Am. Jur., Appeal and Error, \u00a7 277, pp. 53-54, what the plaintiff\u2019s counsel did here was to embark on a line of questions implying quite plainly that the defendant had been taken and held in custody by the sheriff'<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> when, it is equally plain, counsel knew that if detained, it was for a short period and that the defendant on recross examination would be entitled to, would, could, and did,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> show that he had been released next morning with no jail imprisonment or charges ever filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-20\">We have carefully examined the remaining assignments of error and find no merit in them.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-21\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b74-6\">. E. <em>g., </em>one requested a charge that an automobile must be so operated that it may be stopped within the range of the driver\u2019s vision. It was undisputed that the the car stopped well within the driver\u2019s forward vision. The question was not whether he could stop within his range of vision, but whether he was going too fast to stop if, within that range, a young child might suddenly dart out.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b74-7\">.
