On 4 March 1992, the military judge sentenced him to a bad-conduct discharge, confinement for one year, and reduction to Private El. On 23 July 1992, the convening authority suspended the unexecuted confinement portion of the sentence for six months with provision for automatic remission.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-5\">The appellant contends that the military judge erred during the sentencing hearing by allowing the trial counsel to ask the appellant\u2019s first sergeant about the appellant\u2019s rehabilitative potential without first requiring the prosecution to lay a proper foundation for his opinion.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> In response to a question from the trial counsel as to why an administrative separation board was initiated against the appellant, the first sergeant replied, \u201c[Bjecause he came down positive on the urinalysis test,, and it is a given fact in the Army, if a senior NCO comes down positive on a urinalysis test it is pretty much he is through.\u201d As the trial defense counsel did not object to the trial counsel\u2019s inquiry, the appellant has been relegated to arguing that the judge\u2019s omissions constitute plain error and that, under the circumstances of this case, a sentence rehearing is warranted. We disagree with the appellant\u2019s assertions of error and decline to grant a rehearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-6\">Rule for Courts-Martial 1001(b)(5) provides in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b901-7\">The trial counsel may present, by testimony or oral deposition ... evidence, in the form of opinions concerning the accused\u2019s previous performance as a servicemember and potential for rehabilitation. On cross-examination, inquiry is allowable into relevant and specific instances of conduct.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b901-10\">To be admissible under this provision, a government witness\u2019 opinion about the accused\u2019s duty performance and rehabilitative potential must be \u201crationally based.\u201d <em>United States v. Antonitis, </em>29 M.J. 217 (C.M.A.1989); <em>see United States v. Cherry, </em>31 M.J. 1 (C.M.A.1990); <em>United States v. Ohrt, </em>28 M.J. 301 (C.M.A.1989); <em>United States v. Horner, </em>22 M.J. 294 (C.M.A.1986). Whether the opinion meets this \u201crational basis\u201d test depends on whether the witness possesses sufficient knowledge about the accused\u2019s character, duty performance, moral fiber, and desire to be rehabilitated. Where the sole basis for the opinion is the \u201cseverity of the offense\u201d of which the accused stands convicted, it fails the test. <em>Ohrt, </em>28 M.J. at 304; <em>Cherry, </em>31 M.J. at 5. Absent plain error, a failure to object to the admission of opinion evidence on grounds that the witness rendering the opinion did not have a rational basis for it waives the error. <em>United States v. Wilson, </em>31 M.J. 91 (C.M.A.1990); Military Rule of Evidence 103.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-11\">Improperly admitted evidence constitutes plain error when it is obvious, substantial, and unfairly affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of the proceedings. <em>United States v. Fisher, </em>21 M.J. 327, 328 (C.M.A.1986); <em>United States v. Thompson, </em>37 M.J. 1023 (A.C.M.R.1993). What constitutes plain error in the context of an R.C.M. 1001(b)(5) violation depends upon the circumstances surrounding the admission of the opinion evidence. The Court of Military Appeals has reasoned that a derogatory opinion about the accused\u2019s rehabilitative potential from the ac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"710\">*710</page-number>cused\u2019s commanding officer implicates unlawful command influence since there is a likelihood that a court-martial panel will give greater credence and deference to the opinions of one in a leadership position. <em>Cherry, </em>31 M.J. at 5; <em>Ohrt, </em>28 M.J. at 305; <em>see generally, </em>Article 37, UCMJ, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 837. The Court of Military Appeals has often proclaimed that allegations of error predicated on unlawful command influence may be examined on appeal and may be rectified even where there was no objection at trial. <em>See United States v. Kirk, </em>31 M.J. 84, 89 (C.M.A.1990); <em>see generally United States v. Thomas, </em>22 M.J. 388, 393 (C.M.A.1986). The court has found prejudice to the accused where the commander expressed his negative opinion overtly (e.g., \u201cThe accused deserves a punitive discharge.\u201d) or euphemistically (e.g., \u201cThe accused has no rehabilitative potential.\u201d). <em>Cherry, </em>31 M.J. at 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-4\">On the other side of the equation, military judges may delimit the adverse effect of a commander\u2019s opinion by giving appropriate curative instructions. <em>Id. </em>Moreover, where the evidence of record indicates that the commander\u2019s opinion did not substantially affect the sentencing authority\u2019s judgment, there is no plain error. <em>Cf. Cherry, </em>31 M.J. at 6. We also think that such factors as whether the trial was by military judge alone and whether the witness had the capacity to unlawfully influence the proceedings should be weighed in determining whether the prejudice to the accused was sufficiently substantial to constitute plain error. Military judges, unlike courts-martial with members, are unlikely to be unlawfully influenced by a witness\u2019 command status. <em>See United States v. Montgomery, </em>20 U.S.C.M.A. 35, 42 C.M.R. 227, 1970 WL 7053 (1970). Furthermore, noncommissioned officers normally are incapable of exerting improper command influence over a sentencing authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-5\">With these considerations in mind, we hold that the military judge did not commit plain error by allowing the first sergeant to give his opinion about the appellant. Assuming, arguendo, that the first sergeant\u2019s response constitutes a euphemism that violates the principle stated in <em>United States v. Cherry; </em>and, assuming further that, though not a commanding officer, he was in a sufficiently influential leadership position to unlawfully influence a sentencing authority, there is no indication in the record that the opinion of the first sergeant unlawfully influenced the trial judge in determining the sentence. <em>Cf. United States v. Williams, </em>37 M.J. 972 (A.C.M.R.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b902-7\">We have considered the other errors raised by the appellant, including those matters submitted by him pursuant to <em>United States v. Grostefon, </em>12 M.J. 431 (C.M.A.1982), and find them to be without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-8\">The findings of guilty and the sentence are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-9\">Judge LANE and Judge RUSSELL, concur.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b901-12\"> In a similar vein, he also asserts that the judge erred by failing to bar the trial counsel from cross-examining defense mitigation and extenuation witnesses concerning their opinions of the appellant\u2019s rehabilitative potential. We have examined the questions posed by the trial counsel during cross-examination of the defense\u2019s mitigation and extenuation witnesses and find that they do not solicit opinions about the appellant\u2019s rehabilitative potential. After each witness testified on behalf of the appellant, the trial counsel asked the witness if he knew that the appellant had been convicted of using cocaine, writing worthless checks and going AWOL, and whether that was proper conduct for a noncommissioned officer. None of these questions were improper under Rule for Courts-Martial 1001(b)(5) [hereinafter R.C.M.].</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
