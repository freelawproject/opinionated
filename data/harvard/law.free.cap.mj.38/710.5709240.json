We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-8\">I. Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b904-9\">The appellant and a friend, Private First Class (PFC) Sams, attended a party in Killeen, Texas, on 3 May 1991. There they met a woman soldier who they agreed to drive back to the barracks at Fort Hood. On the way to the barracks, the woman, who was very drunk, vomited on herself. The appellant and PFC Sams took her to PFC Sams\u2019 off-post apartment to clean her up. What occurred at the apartment led to the rape charge. The appellant\u2019s sworn statement regarding his conduct at the apartment was the basis of the false swearing charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-10\">After the woman filed a complaint with the Killeen, Texas, Police Department accusing the appellant of rape, he was questioned by police officers of that department and later by agents of the Criminal Investigation Command (CID). The woman named PFC Sams as a witness, and PFC Sams was also questioned by the Killeen police. Concerned about the allegations, both men decided to seek the advice of a local attorney, Mr. H, who had previously represented PFC Sams on a drunk driving charge. They visited Mr. H\u2019s office on 14 May. At trial, the appellant described the meeting as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b904-13\">Q. Okay, tell the judge about what you did, basically, when you arrived [at Mr. H\u2019s office].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b904-14\">A. Well, sir, we got to Mr. [H\u2019s] office. His secretary had us fill out a form and Mr. [\u00b6] called us back, reviewed the form, and he said he wouldn\u2019t do nothing ... he wouldn\u2019t even talk to us unless he had a retainer fee. So, me and Sams, we talked and I said, \u201cWell, let me go get the checkbook,\u201d because my wife, she was out shopping. So, Private Sams, he ran me home and I got the checkbook and we went back and retained Mr. [H].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b904-15\">Q. And you were doing this all together?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b904-16\">A. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b904-17\">Q. Did he split the money with you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A3s\">A. No, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b904-18\">Q. Did you expect him to?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b904-19\">A. No, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b904-20\">Q. Okay, but as far as getting the checkbook and seeing Mr. [H], you did go together?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b904-21\">A. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b904-22\">Q. Okay, so you basically wanted him to be your attorney, right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b904-23\">A. Correct, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b904-24\">Q. And you knew that he was an attorney, right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b904-25\">A. Right, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b904-26\">Q. And any conversations that you had with him ... how did you feel about the confidentiality of the conversation, if there was any?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b904-27\">A. Well, I felt that it was supposed to be ... whoever heard it in the room, that\u2019s all it was going to be.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b905-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"713\">*713</page-number>Q. Well, PFC Sams was there. Did you expect it to be confidential, even with him being there?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b905-5\">A. Yes, sir, because he had questions legally ... he was asking questions of Mr [\u00b6] and, since we both was in there, it was ... I asked Sams and he said, \u201cWell, we\u2019re both here and we both need legal advice, so we\u2019ll just go with what Mr. [\u00b6] has to say.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b905-6\">Q. Did you feel that you had a common interest in being there?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b905-7\">A. Oh, yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b905-8\">Q. And, incidentally, with respect to PFC Sams, had he told you that he was a suspect of the Killeen Police Department?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b905-9\">A. Oh, yes, sir, he told me he was being accused of falsifying a statement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b905-10\">Q. No, I\u2019m talking about the police department in Killeen, not the CID.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b905-11\">A. Oh, Killeen? Yeah, they told him he was a suspect in the case, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b905-12\">Q. What kind of suspect?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b905-13\">A. A witness as to what actually happened.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b905-14\">Q. And you were the only one who came back with a retainer fee, right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Apk\">A. I was the only one who came back with the money, sir, but I was not the only one seeking legal advice.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b905-15\">During the meeting with Mr. H, the appellant admitted having intercourse with the victim. PFC Sams later reported this damaging admission to the CID, and the trial counsel sought to introduce the admission into evidence at the appellant\u2019s trial. The correctness of the military judge\u2019s ruling permitting the appellant\u2019s statement into evidence is at issue here.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-16\">Mr. H represented the appellant at trial. Wisely, the trial counsel moved in limine for a judicial ruling to determine whether PFC Sams would be allowed to testify as to the appellant\u2019s admission made during the interview with Mr. H. Assuming that the communication was not privileged, the trial counsel also moved to have Mr. H disqualified from representing the appellant because of a conflict of interest and because Mr. H was a potential witness to the appellant's admission.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The defense team, consisting of Mr. H and a military defense counsel, opposed the motion. Mr. H did not testify on the motion; the military defense counsel questioned PFC Sams and the appellant, who were the only two witnesses on the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-20\">Private First Class Sams testified that he accompanied the appellant to Mr. H\u2019s office because he, PFC Sams, was worried about his own involvement in the incident after being questioned by the Killeen police and making a written statement to them.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> PFC Sams testified that \u201c[m]y main concern was to see if I needed advice ... I mean, needed representation. I obviously needed advice.\u201d PFC Sams admitted that he did not ask Mr. H to represent him nor did he pay Mr. H a retainer. Both the appellant and PFC Sams testified that they expected their conversations with Mr. H to be confidential.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-21\">After hearing the testimony of PFC Sams and the appellant, the military judge entered findings of fact and conclusions of law. The military judge summarized the contentions of the parties and his conclusions as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b905-22\">The government maintains that PFC Sams was a third party, or an interloper, and, thus, the statements were not the result and [sic] afforded the protected status of privileged confidential attorney-client communications and, thus, at least from the position of the government, PFC Sams should be permitted to either testify as to what he had observed or his statement should be accepted into evidence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b905-23\">The defense, on the other hand, maintains that both PFC Sams and Specialist <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"714\">*714</page-number>Nelson were there together; that they had a common interest; and that there was an understanding that everything said was, in fact, confidential; and that Specialist Nelson, as a client of Mr. [H], has the right to invoke the client-attorney [sic] privilege and, thus, prevent PFC Sams from relating what he had heard while he was in the office.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b906-4\">Upon carefully reviewing the briefs, particularly [with reference to] Military Rule of Evidence 502,1 find that, certainly, Specialist Nelson was, in fact, a client of Mr. [\u00b6] and that Mr. [H], upon accepting Specialist Nelson\u2019s retainer fee, was, in fact, his attorney, so that there was an client-attorney relationship between Mr. [\u00b6] and Specialist Nelson. On the other hand, PFC Sams did not retain Mr. [H], did not offer any retainer fee, and thus, did not, at that time, have a client-attorney relationship. The fact that he was still ... that is, \u201che\u201d, PFC Sams ... making monthly payments to Mr. [H], due to the earlier DWI hearing, does not, in my opinion, make him a client or Mr. [\u00b6] his attorney for this matter.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b906-5\">Upon carefully reviewing [Military Rule of Evidence] 502,1 find that, due to the presence of a third party ... that is, PFC Sams ... although Specialist Nelson may well have believed that his statements were protected as a result of his client-attorney relationship, the statements were, in fact, not so protected. PFC Sams was not a representative of either, he was not a client, and, although he did have an interest in the proceedings, he was not a party to the confidential communication. Due to PFC Sams\u2019 presence, the conversation was not confidential and I find nothing in Rule 502 which would allow Specialist Nelson to protect this conversation and bar the testimony of PFC Sams. Thus, I hold that PFC Sams will be permitted to testify as to what he has heard or, perhaps, in the alternative, that his potential testimony or his statement of 1 October is not specifically barred due to the attorney-client privilege. However, that is not to say that the defense may not have other legal bases to suppress the statement or the testimony.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b906-8\">Following this ruling, the appellant entered pleas of not guilty, and as part of the government\u2019s case PFC Sams testified that the appellant admitted to Mr. H that he had intercourse with the complainant. The appellant was convicted of rape, adultery, and of falsely swearing that he had not been alone with the complainant in PFC Sams\u2019 apartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-9\">II. Law</p>\n<p id=\"b906-10\">Military Rule of Evidence 502 [hereinafter Mil.R.Evid.] discusses confidential communications and the lawyer-client privilege.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Rule 502 provides in pertinent part that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b906-11\">(a) <em>General rule of privilege. </em>A client has a privilege to refuse to disclose and to prevent any other person from disclosing confidential communications made for the purpose of facilitating the rendition of professional legal services to the client, (1) between the client or the client\u2019s representative and the lawyer or the lawyer\u2019s representative, (2) between the lawyer and the lawyer\u2019s representative, (3) by the client or the client\u2019s lawyer to a lawyer representing another in a matter of common interest, (4) between representatives of the client or between the client and a representative of the client, or between lawyers representing the client</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b906-12\">(b) <em>Definitions. </em>As used in this rule:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b906-13\">(1) A \u201cclient\u201d is a person ... who receives professional legal services from a lawyer, or who consults a lawyer with a view to obtaining professional legal services from a lawyer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b907-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"715\">*715</page-number>(3) A \u201crepresentative\u201d of a lawyer is a person employed by or assigned to assist a lawyer in providing professional legal services.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b907-5\">(4) A communication is \u201cconfidential\u201d if not intended to be disclosed to third persons other than those to whom disclosure is in furtherance of the rendition of professional legal services to the client or those reasonably necessary for the transmission of the communication.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b907-6\">(c) <em>Who may claim the privilege. </em>The privilege may be claimed by the client____ The lawyer or the lawyer\u2019s representative ... may claim the privilege on behalf of the client____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b907-9\">(d) <em>Exceptions. </em>There is no privilege under this rule under the following circumstances:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b907-10\">(5) <em>Joint clients. </em>As to a communication relevant to a matter of common interest between two or more clients if the communication was made by any of them to a lawyer retained or consulted in common, when offered in an action between any of the clients.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b907-11\">The attorney-client privilege extends only to confidential communications. Saltzburg, <em>supra, </em>at 426. Determination whether a communication is \u201cconfidential\u201d requires an examination of the communicating party\u2019s intent and the circumstances. MiLR.Evid. 502(b)(4), analysis at A22-36. Doubts are resolved in favor of the accused. <em>United States v. Gandy, </em>9 U.S.C.M.A. 355, 26 C.M.R. 135, 141 (1958); <em>United States v. Green, </em>5 U.S.C.M.A. 610, 18 C.M.R. 234, 237 (1955). <em>See generally United States v. Henson, </em>20 M.J. 620 (A.C.M.R.1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b907-12\">As a general rule, disclosures in the presence of third parties destroys the confidentiality of the communication, thus rendering the communication unprotected by the privilege. <em>United States v. McCluskey, </em>6 U.S.C.M.A. 545, 20 C.M.R. 261 (1955); <em>United States v. Landof </em>591 F.2d 36 (9th Cir.1978); Wigmore, Evidence (3rd ed. 1983), \u00a7\u00a7 2311, 2326; McCormick on Evidence, vol 1, \u00a7 91 (4th ed. 1992). However, the general rule has exceptions. The \u201cincidental communication of information to a co-client while communicating with one\u2019s attorney, [is confidential and] does not constitute waiver of the privilege____\u201d <em>United States v. Moscony, </em>927 F.2d 742, 753 (3rd Cir.1991), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 111 S.Ct. 2812, 115 L.Ed.2d 984 (1991) (citing Weinstein\u2019s <em>Evidence, </em>para. 503(b)[06] at 503-100; and, <em>Testimonial Privileges, </em>\u00a7 1.55 at 92).</p>\n<p id=\"b907-18\">The attorney-client privilege may attach to confidences shared with an attorney during initial discussions between the parties even though the relationship does not continue. <em>Levin v. Ripple Twist Mills, Inc., </em>416 F.Supp. 876, 883 (E.D.Pa.1976). If an attorney initially undertakes to represent several accused, communications made by one of them are protected in a prosecution against any of them. MiLR.Evid. 502(d)(5); <em>see </em>Saltzburg, <em>supra, </em>at 427. Under MiLR.Evid. 502(d)(5), \u201c[o]nly when they sue each other does the privilege disappear.\u201d <em>Id. See also </em>Joseph A. Wood-ruff, Privileges Under the Military Rules of Evidence, 92 Military Law Review 5, 18 (1981) (opining that the exception to the privilege contained in MiLR.Evid. 502(d)(5) is wholly inapplicable to courts-martial because a criminal proceeding is never an action \u201cbetween\u201d any of the clients).</p>\n<p id=\"b907-19\">The privilege may apply even if the attorney declines to represent one of the parties after an initial joint consultation. In <em>In re Auclair, </em>961 F.2d 65 (5th Cir.1992), three persons sought the advice and representation of one attorney, who interviewed all three together and individually. The attorney declined to represent two of the three. The attorney was later called to testify as to disclosures made by the one person accepted as a client. The court ruled that confidential communications made with a view toward employing a lawyer are privileged even when employment is not accepted. <em>Accord, Levin, </em>416 F.Supp. at 883. The court in <em>Auclair </em>held that when persons with common interests seek the advice of a lawyer and are seeking common representation there is a reason<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"716\">*716</page-number>able expectation of confidentiality and therefore, communication by the client is privileged.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-4\">The burden of demonstrating that an attorney-client relationship exists and that information falls within the privilege rests upon the party asserting the privilege. <em>Weil v. Investment/Indicators, Research &amp; Mgt., Inc., </em>647 F.2d 18 (9th Cir.1981). Ultimately, application of the attorney-client privilege is a question of fact. <em>In re Auclair, </em>961 F.2d at 68.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-5\">III. Decision</p>\n<p id=\"b908-6\">We agree with the military judge\u2019s basic findings of fact. However, we disagree with the military judge\u2019s conclusions that PFC Sams was not a \u201cclient\u201d and that no attorney-client privilege existed in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-7\">If we were to apply the general rule that the presence of third parties destroys the confidentiality of the communication, we would find that the presence of PFC Sams, a third party, caused the communication to lack confidentiality. However, one of the exceptions to the general rule involves situations, such as here, when two or more persons consult with one attorney concerning a matter of common interest. The appellant and PFC Sams each sought the advice of Mr. H regarding different aspects of a common legal problem. Each apparently asked questions of Mr. H. and may have received some advice from him.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-8\">While the military judge\u2019s finding of fact that PFC Sams had neither retained Mr. H nor offered any retainer fee may be correct, we specifically reject his conclusion that there was no relationship implicating the attorney-client privilege in this case. Payment of a retainer fee or the agreement of an attorney to represent a person is not the test. PFC Sams was a \u201cclient\u201d within the meaning of Mil.R.Evid. 502 without regard to whether a retainer fee was offered or paid, and without regard to whether Mr. H agreed to represent PFC Sams in the matter discussed. The precedents cited above are consistent with this conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-11\">The evidence of record demonstrates both soldiers intended to seek legal advice and intended that their communications with Mr. H were to be confidential. We find that the appellant\u2019s communication was \u201cconfidential.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b908-12\">We find that PFC Sams was a \u201cjoint client\u201d as described in Mil.R.Evid. 502(d)(5). We further find that the communication was not disclosed in an action between the appellant and PFC Sams; therefore, the exception to the privilege contained in Mil. R.Evid. 502(d)(5) does not apply. Any ambiguities regarding the privilege we resolve in favor of the appellant. We conclude that the appellant has met his burden of showing that the confidential communication was privileged under the facts of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-13\">We hold that the appellant\u2019s statement made to his attorney in the presence of PFC Sams was confidential and that it was a privileged communication. The statement was therefore inadmissible into evidence against the appellant after he claimed the attorney-client privilege.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-14\">We further find the military judge\u2019s ruling to be prejudicial error requiring corrective action as to the rape charge. The appellant elected not to testify as to either offense of which he was convicted. The defense theory regarding the rape was that the appellant and PFC Sams were merely assisting a very drunk woman who had vomited on herself, and that no sexual activity occurred. Private First Class Sams\u2019 improperly admitted testimony about what he overheard in the lawyer\u2019s office undermined this theory. On the other hand, the appellant\u2019s conviction for lying under oath was not affected by PFC Sams\u2019 testimony about what he overheard. We will therefore take corrective action as to the rape charge only.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b909-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"717\">*717</page-number>The findings of guilty of the Charge and its Specification (rape) and the sentence are set aside. The finding of guilty of Specification 1 of the Additional Charge (false swearing) is affirmed. Specification 2 of the Additional Charge (adultery), dismissed by the military judge after findings as multiplicious with rape, is hereby reinstated. The record of trial is returned to the Judge Advocate General for submission to the same or a different convening authority who may order a rehearing on the rape and adultery charges and on the sentence. If the convening authority determines that a rehearing on the rape and adultery charges is impracticable, he may dismiss those specifications and order a rehearing on sentence only. If the convening authority determines that a rehearing on sentence is impracticable, he may reassess the sentence on the basis of the affirmed finding of guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-5\">Judge JOHNSTON and Judge BAKER concur.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b904-11\">. After entry of findings and after determining the adultery charge was multiplicious with the rape charge, the military judge conditionally dismissed the adultery charge \u201con condition that the rape offense is approved by the Convening and appellate authorities.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b905-17\">. We need not decide this aspect of the motion because of our disposition of the case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b905-18\">. Apparently PFC Sams had cause to seek legal advice of his own. Subsequent to the interview with Mr. H, PFC Sams was investigated for lying in his sworn statement to the Killeen police regarding the incident.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b906-6\">. Much of Mil.R.Evid. 502 is taken from Proposed Federal Rule of Evidence 503 [hereinafter Fed.R.Evid.]. Mil.R.Evid. 502 analysis at page A22-36. While the Supreme Court approved Proposed Fed.R.Evid. 503, Congress rejected it. Stephen A. Saltzburg et al., Federal Rules of Evidence Manual at 587 and 593 (5th ed. 1990). <em>See generally id., </em>at 403-07. We need not decide the reach of the President's authority under Article 36, UCMJ, to prescribe rules of evidence, as Fed.R.Evid. 501, a general rule of privilege based on the common law, remains in effect in the federal courts. <em>Compare </em>UCMJ art. 36(a) <em>with </em>Mil.R.Evid. 101(b)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b908-9\">.
