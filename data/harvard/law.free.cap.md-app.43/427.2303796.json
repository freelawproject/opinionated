Appellant, Gene <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>Thomas Meyer, was convicted of first degree murder of the mother and second degree murder of the child and received sentences of life imprisonment and thirty years, to be served consecutively. On this appeal, the major issue presented involves Maryland District Rule 723 (M.D.R.) requiring an arrested person to be presented \u201cwithout unnecessary delay\u201d before a judicial officer. Appellant, relying upon <em>Johnson v. State, </em>282 Md. 314, 384 A.2d 709 (1978), contends that two statements obtained from him by the police should have been suppressed as products of an unnecessary delay in presenting him before a District Court Commissioner. In opposition, the State argues: that <em>Johnson </em>should only be applied prospectively to arrests occurring after April 6,1978, the date of the decision; and alternatively, that the delay in presentment was necessary, that the admission of the first statement, if erroneous, was harmless; and that the second statement was a product of deliberate reflection.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-5\">Appellant has also challenged an in-court identification allegedly made under \u201cimpermissibly suggestive circumstances;\u201d the introduction of allegedly inflammatory color photographs of the crime scene and of the autopsy; the admissibility of opinions contained in the autopsy reports; the seizure of his automobile in Virginia by Prince George\u2019s County (Maryland) Police; and a jury instruction containing a reference to \u201cprobable cause.\u201d Finding no reversible error, we shall affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b449-7\">The record of the suppression hearings discloses that, on September 23, 1977, Lon Alec Lewis, after finishing work, returned to his home in Bowie and found, in the kitchen, the bodies of his 27-year old wife, Carol, and 3-month old baby, Heather. He summoned help from a neighbor, and the police were called. Both Carol and Heather had been the victims of an assailant who had brutally stabbed them to death with a knife.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-8\">Over the next two weeks, Lon Lewis fully cooperated with the police. He permitted them to search his home and consented to being interviewed. During the course of those <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>interviews, Mr. Lewis admitted having a girlfriend in Texas who had been communicating with him by letters mailed to Mr. Lewis at the address of appellant, Gene Meyer. On October 6, 1977, a Prince George\u2019s County police officer visited the appellant at his Rockville, Montgomery County, apartment to obtain any of the Texas girlfriend\u2019s letters that Mr. Meyer.might have been holding for Mr. Lewis. Although Mr. Meyer did not have any letters, he was interviewed, and a written statement was taken in which he discussed Mr. Lewis\u2019 Texas liaison. Mr. Meyer stated that he learned of Mr. Lewis\u2019 girlfriend when he and Mr. Lewis had spent a week in Texas attending a training program sponsored by their employer.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-5\">The next day, October 7, 1977, Lon Lewis was further questioned by the police. Early in the evening he admitted his complicity in the murders of his wife and child and was arrested.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Over the next few hours he gave a written statement to the police describing in detail an agreement between himself and Mr. Meyer in which the murders of their wives had been planned.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-6\">Acting upon this information and the description provided by a witness who saw a man approaching the Lewis house shortly before the murders were committed, the police obtained a warrant for the arrest of the appellant. At 7:15 a.m., on October 8, 1977, Mr. Meyer was arrested at his apartment in Rockville, handcuffed, placed in the back seat of a police cruiser, and given his <em>Miranda </em>warnings.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b450-7\">Detective David Hatfield, who rode in the police cruiser during the trip to the Bureau of Criminal Investigation (BCI) in Forestville, Prince George\u2019s County, from Rockville, testified at the pretrial suppression hearing and described appellant\u2019s reaction when told of the Lon Lewis statement. Mr. Meyer wanted to see the Lewis statement and told <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>Detective Hatfield that the police would have to \u201cprove it\u201d because it was Mr. Lewis\u2019 word against his.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-5\">Upon arriving at BCI, the appellant was placed in an interrogation room, unhandcuffed, and offered some coffee. Detective Hatfield obtained the Lewis statement, and together the two men spent almost two hours reading the 14-page typed and handwritten document. Detective Hatfield testified that Mr. Meyer, after reading the statement, offered to tell his side of the story: \u201c[H]e said he would give a truthful response.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b451-6\">Over the next six hours, until shortly before 4 p.m., Mr. Meyer gave a statement which was transcribed by Detective Hatfield. In this statement (the first statement) the appellant denied any involvement in the murders. Instead, he blamed Lon Lewis, stating \u201cWhen I heard the news that she got killed I figured he did it or got someone to do it.\u201d Appellant also expanded upon his previous discussion of the Lewis Texas tryst, and he admitted being at the Lewis home on Thursday, September 22, 1977, the night before the murders. He also acknowledged owning a cream-colored suit and a briefcase.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-7\">After giving this first statement, the appellant was transported to Upper Marlboro from BCI and presented before District Court Commissioner Michael J. O\u2019Brien at 4:15 p.m. The Commissioner certified that he informed the appellant of his rights set forth in the charging document,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and the appellant similarly signed an acknowledgment of receipt of such rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-8\">On the trip back to BCI from the Commissioner, Mr. Meyer indicated that he was hungry. A steak dinner was purchased, and the appellant ate his dinner back at BCI in an interrogation room. Detective Corporal Michael K. Morrissette was present while the appellant had dinner, and according to Corporal Morrissette\u2019s testimony he engaged the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>appellant in general conversation, discussing his upbringing, background, job, and marriage.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-5\">At 6 p.m., Corporal Morrissette read the <em>Miranda </em>warnings to the appellant. He orally waived his rights and expressed a willingness to talk to the police. During the next three hours, the story gradually unfolded. The appellant admitted killing 3-month old Heather, but stated that it was an accident. He also confessed to the stabbing of Carol Lewis. At 9 p.m., there was a twenty-minute break during which Corporal Morrissette prepared to take a written statement from the appellant. From 9:20 to 10:00, the two men worked on a written statement (the second statement); Corporal Morrissette typed each of the four pages and Mr. Meyer signed each page at the bottom. After the confession was completed, the appellant was asked to sign a written waiver of rights, but he refused. Shortly after 10:00 p.m., Mr. Meyer was transported to the Prince George\u2019s County Detention Center from BCI.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-6\">Hearings on the appellant\u2019s motion to suppress evidence, including the first and second statements, were held over a period of four days during March and April, 1978.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Judge Jacob S. Levin denied the motions. Trial commenced April 20, 1978 on two counts of murder in the first degree. On April 26, 1978, the jury returned verdicts finding the appellant guilty of the first degree murder of Carol Lewis and the second degree murder of Heather Lewis.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b453-6\">The appellant first urges that the trial judge was in error when he denied the appellant\u2019s motion to suppress the two statements taken after the appellant\u2019s arrest. It is his contention that the police violated M.D.R. 723 by unnecessarily delaying his initial appearance before a judicial officer. Citing <em>Johnson v. State, </em>282 Md. 314, 384 A.2d 709 (1978), he argues that the first statement should have been suppressed because it was taken prior to his initial appearance and during a period of unnecessary delay.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Appellant also urges us to rule that the second statement should have been suppressed for two reasons: first, the initial appearance before Commissioner O\u2019Brien was defective because the Commissioner did not read the complete \u201cadvice of right to counsel\u201d required by M.D.R. 723 (b); second, the statement was \u201ctainted by the previous illegal detention,\u201d and does, therefore, fall within the <em>Johnson </em>exclusionary rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-7\">\n<em>THE FIRST STATEMENT</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b453-8\">In response to the appellant\u2019s argument that the period during which the first statement was taken constituted an \u201cunnecessary delay\u201d in bringing the appellant before a judicial officer, the State first urges us to conclude, as did the trial judge, that the nine hour delay was necessary under the circumstances presented here. Appellee points out that the appellant had to be transported to BCI from his home in Rockville, processed, and then transported to the Commissioner from BCI; but concedes that, at most, these events consumed a total of eighty minutes. Any contention that a period of eighty minutes establishes a necessity for a nine hour delay is patently without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-9\">In <em>Johnson, </em>the Court of Appeals listed five examples of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>necessary delay. <em>Id. </em>at 329, 384 A.2d at 717. The examples were intended to be just that; they were not intended to be an entire litany of occurrences from which the State is required to justify a delay in the initial appearance of a defendant before a judicial officer. <em>Lewis v. State, </em>285 Md. 705, 404 A.2d 1073 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b454-5\">M.D.R. 723, while allowing for necessary delays in presenting a defendant before a judicial officer, does not countenance a delay for the principal purpose of obtaining a statement or a confession from the defendant. The Maryland Rule has its antecedents in the federal <em>McNabb-Mallory </em>Rule. <em>McNabb v. United States, </em>318 U.S. 332 (1943); <em>Mallory v. United States, </em>354 U.S. 449 (1957). In the latter case the Court made it plain that \u201cthe delay must not be of a nature to give <em>opportunity </em>for the extraction of a confession.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 455 (emphasis added); <em>see also United States v. Meachum, </em>197 F. Supp. 803 (D.D.C. 1961); <em>Commonwealth v. Davenport, </em>471 Pa. 278, 370 A.2d 301 (1977). M.D.R. 723 is designed to insure that even a defendant arrested pursuant to a warrant is promptly brought before a neutral judicial authority who can formally apprise the defendant of his rights and ascertain his desires with regard to legal counsel.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>See, e.g., Watson v. United States, </em>234 F.2d 42 (D.C. Cir. 1956) and 249 F.2d 106 D.C. Cir. 1957).</p>\n<p id=\"b454-6\">In the instant case, Mr. Meyer was arrested at 7:00 a.m. and taken to BCI. He was informed of the existence of the Lewis statement implicating him in the murders; he requested to see the statement and then offered his own version denying any involvement in the brutal stabbings. In <em>Commonwealth v. Abu-Ibn Hanifah Bey, </em>462 Pa. 533, 341 A.2d 907 (1975), the Pennsylvania Supreme Court held that a delay for the purpose of confronting a defendant with a statement implicating him in a robbery and taking his statement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>thereafter is \u201cunnecessary\u201d under the terms of a similar Pennsylvania rule. Here an obvious opportunity existed for the extraction of a confession after the appellant\u2019s arrest and prior to his initial appearance. It was error to admit the first statement because it was obtained in violation of M.D.R. 723. <em>Johnson v. State, </em>282 Md. 314, 384 A.2d 709 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b455-5\">Upon our own independent review of the record, however, we are convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that the erroneous admission of the first statement in no way influenced the jury\u2019s verdict. The error is, therefore, harmless and reversal of the conviction is not required. <em>Dorsey v. State, </em>276 Md. 638, 659, 350 A.2d 665, 678 (1976). <em>See also Chapman v. California, </em>386 U.S. 18 (1967); <em>Harrington v. California, </em>395 U.S. 250 (1969); <em>Fahy v. Connecticut, </em>375 U.S. 85 (1963). It is of no significance that the error complained of is not of constitutional dimension, for Maryland has but one harmless error rule for criminal cases. <em>Dorsey, id. </em>at 657-59, 350 A.2d at 677-78.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-6\">In the erroneously admitted first statement, Mr. Meyer vehemently denied any involvement in the murders; he did accuse Lon Lewis of complicity in the crimes. He also expanded somewhat on the information he had previously supplied to the police concerning Mr. Lewis\u2019 Texas girlfriend.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Mr. Meyer did admit visiting the Lewis home the night before the murders, and he did admit owning a cream-colored suit and a black briefcase. The major portion of the first statement, however, was devoted to the appellant\u2019s denial of culpability in the crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-7\">The evidence in the case was overwhelming. The appellant\u2019s confession detailing the manner of the stabbings was, as we hold, <em>infra, </em>properly received into evidence. <em>Cf. Milton v. Wainright, </em>407 U.S. 371 (1972) (erroneous admission of inculpatory statement was harmless in light of other properly admitted confessions). An eyewitness identified the appellant, both in and out of court, as the person she saw approaching <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>the Lewis home shortly before the murders were committed. In addition, there was independent evidence of the ownership of the briefcase: a picture of the briefcase lying on the back seat of the appellant\u2019s automobile was admitted along with the briefcase itself. Other evidence clearly linked the appellant to the crime: expert testimony concerning the nature of the wounds on the victims\u2019 bodies and the strength required to inflict such wounds; and blood found on the appellant\u2019s shoes.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-5\">The facts contained in this first statement were either cumulative of the other evidence or insignificant in light of the other evidence. Moreover, the essence of the statement was exculpatory. Its admission into evidence, while erroneous under M.D.R. 723 (a), was harmless error in this case. <em>See Bartram v. State, </em>33 Md. App. 115, 152-56, 364 A.2d 1119, 1141-43 (1976), <em>aff\u2019d, </em>280 Md. 616, 374 A.2d 1144 (1977); <em>Holloway v. State, </em>26 Md. App. 382, 395-96, 339 A.2d 319, 326-27 (1975).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b456-6\">\n<em>THE SECOND STATEMENT</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b456-7\">Appellant first asserts that Commissioner O\u2019Brien failed to give the appellant the full advice of right to counsel as required by M.D.R. 723 (b) as set out in M.D.R. 711 (a). This argument is based on the testimony of Commissioner O\u2019Brien at the pretrial suppression hearing and at trial when he was asked to recite the advice given to the appellant; his testimony, while patterned on the <em>Miranda </em>warnings, did not specifically track the language in M.D.R. 711 (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b456-8\">We do not think that appellant\u2019s argument can be sustained. It overlooks the acknowledgments signed by both the Commissioner and the appellant at the initial appearance. <em>See </em>n.3, <em>supra. </em>The \u201cadvice of right to counsel\u201d that appears on the charging document, which appellant by his signature <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>acknowledged reading and receiving, conforms with the requirements of M.D.R. 711 (a). In light of this documentary evidence indicating compliance with M.D.R. 723 (b), the appellant\u2019s assertion premised on a mere imprecision in the Commissioner\u2019s testimony must fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-5\">It is also argued by the appellant that the second statement in which he confessed to the murders should have been suppressed because of the preceding illegal detention which violated M.D.R. 723 (a). Since we have found that the appellant\u2019s initial appearance before the Commissioner was unnecessarily delayed by the police, we must focus upon the circumstances surrounding the second statement, specifically to ascertain whether it was an \u201cindependent act\u201d and a product of \u201cdeliberate reflection.\u201d <em>Johnson v. State, </em>282 Md. 314, 330, 384 A.2d 709, 718 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b457-6\">A similar situation was presented in <em>Johnson: the </em>police had taken two statements from the defendant, one prior to his initial appearance and one following the appearance. In ruling that the second statement should have been excluded, Judge Levin stated for the Court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b457-7\">\u201cAppellant\u2019s second statement, admitting responsibility for the Rainbow Cleaners holdup and shooting, which was given almost immediately upon appellant\u2019s return from the commissioner on January 31, should likewise have been suppressed. <em>We cannot say, on the record before us, that the second confession was an independent act, occurring after time for deliberate reflection and therefore free from the taint of the preceding illegal detention.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b457-9\"><em>Id. </em>at 330, 384 A.2d at 718 (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b457-10\">In our judgment the State has met its burden of showing in this case that the second confession was an independent act and a product of deliberate reflection. Appellant\u2019s first statement was essentially exculpatory; he denied any involvement in the murders. In <em>Johnson, </em>the defendant \u201call but confessed\u201d in the first statement, <em>id. </em>at 318, 384 A.2d at 711; in the second statement he \u201cconfessed outright.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>318, 384 A.2d at 712. Moreover, appellant here completed his first statement at 3:45 p.m. He was then driven to Upper Marlboro from BCI, presented before Commissioner O\u2019Brien, and transported back to BCI. During the return trip, a stop was made in order to purchase, at his request, a steak dinner.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-5\">Questioning by Corporal Morrissette did not begin until after Mr. Meyer had finished his dinner at 6:00 p.m. \u2014 almost two hours after his initial appearance before the Commissioner. The questioning lasted for three hours; there was a twenty-minute break, and then the written second statement was prepared between 9:20 p.m. and 10:00 p.m. \u2014 a period of five hours after the appellant\u2019s initial appearance. Although the appellant signed the bottom of each page of the second statement, when presented with a written waiver of rights, he declined to sign that paper, thus indicating that he was fully cognizant of his actions at the time. We also note that Corporal Morrissette testified that he gave the appellant full <em>Miranda </em>warnings at the start of the 6:00 p.m. interrogation session and that the appellant orally agreed to waive those rights and to proceed with the questioning.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-6\">In evaluating the circumstances surrounding a confession which follows upon the heels of an illegal detention, we do not apply a rigid talismanic test. <em>See generally United States v. Close, </em>349 F.2d 841, 851 (4th Cir. 1965), <em>cert. denied, </em>382 U.S. 992 (1966); <em>Wilkins v. Maryland, </em>402 F. Supp. 76, 83 (D. Md. 1975), <em>aff\u2019d, </em>538 F.2d 327 (4th Cir. 1976), <em>cert. denied, </em>429 U.S. 1044 (1977). Instead, we consider all of the circumstances surrounding the confession, including the time, place, and manner of its taking; intervening events; its content compared to prior statements given by the appellant; and other factors reflecting upon the appellant\u2019s alleged free will in making the statement. The list is not exclusive. Taking all of the foregoing into consideration, we hold that the State demonstrated that the second statement was a product of the appellant\u2019s free will divorced from the preceding illegal detention. Judge Levin was correct in denying the motion to suppress the second statement, when he said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-7\">\u201cThe inculpatory statement that was taken from the Defendant was taken subsequent to his being taken <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>before the commissioner, and after a time for eating and a time for reflection, and a time for deliberation. It is my judgment that the Johnson v. State of Maryland case is distinguishable from the facts in this case____\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b459-5\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b459-6\">On the day Carol and Heather Lewis were murdered, 12-year old Darlene Brown observed a man walking up the driveway toward the front door of the Lewis home between 4:45-5:00 p.m. At that time Darlene was walking down the driveway of her house across the street from the Lewis home. That night after the murders had been discovered, Darlene gave the police a written description of the man she had seen earlier. Four days later she made another written statement describing him. Both descriptions indicated that the suspect was in his late twenties, clean shaven, over six feet tall, and had blondish hair. Darlene also told the police that he was wearing a light-colored suit and that he was carrying a briefcase.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-7\">From this description, the police made a composite drawing. Then, on October 8, 1977, the day of appellant\u2019s arrest, Corporal Morrissette brought six pictures to Darlene\u2019s home and asked her to look at the pictures to see if she recognized the man she had seen on the Lewis driveway fifteen days earlier. After discarding a picture of Detective Kowalski who had worked on the composite drawing with her, she carefully considered the other five photographs and picked out the appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-8\">Appellant has continually argued that the photographic array was impermissibly suggestive and would, therefore, taint an in-court identification.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The photographs are part of the record and we have independently examined them and the testimony concerning the conduct of the array. Although the photographs were not absolutely uniform, they were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>substantially similar. We are unable to find that the photographic array, under \u201cthe totality of the circumstances surrounding it, was so unnecessarily suggestive as to give rise to a very substantial likelihood of irreparable misidentification____\u201d <em>Smith and Samuels v. State, </em>6 Md. App. 59, 67, 250 A.2d 285, 290 (1969), <em>cert. denied, </em>397 U.S. 1057 (1970). Indeed, the photographic array shown to Darlene Brown does not have even threshold suggestiveness, and therefore, appellant has not carried his initial burden requiring a response by the State. <em>Godwin v. State, </em>38 Md. App. 716, 727, 382 A.2d 596, 603 (1978). <em>See McDowell v. State, </em>31 Md. App. 652, 663, 358 A.2d 624, 630 (1976); <em>Martin v. State, </em>40 Md. App. 248, 255, 389 A.2d 1374, 1378 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b460-7\">At trial, but out of the presence of the jury, Darlene, who had never been inside a courtroom before, took the witness stand and was asked to make an in-court identification of the man she saw at the Lewis home. She stood up and pointed to co-counsel David M. Martin, seated at the counsel table with principal trial counsel, Joseph A. DePaul. Appellant had been previously seated among the courtroom spectators. After a bench conference during which the State argued that the defense had engaged in misleading tactics, the judge ordered the bailiff to bring in the jury. However, before the bailiff could leave, Darlene asked permission to try again because \u201cI saw a couple of people I didn\u2019t see before.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b460-8\">Over vigorous objections by the defense and after some brief questioning by the court, all males in the courtroom were ordered to stand, and Darlene was permitted to walk around the courtroom eliminating the males one by one. When a few men remained standing, she returned to the stand and identified the appellant. She was then questioned by the court and denied receiving any assistance or prompting. She attributed her need for a second opportunity to her failure to look closely, in the first instance, at the men in the back of the courtroom.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-9\">Before the jury returned, appellant\u2019s counsel produced six witnesses who testified that Darlene appeared to have had eye-contact with some spectators during the bench conference that followed her erroneous first identification. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>None of these witnesses heard Darlene speak, although one witness stated that she appeared to mouth some words. After the testimony was concluded, the jury returned and the court, over the appellant\u2019s continuing objection, allowed Darlene to identify the appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-5\">As we understand appellant\u2019s argument, it is premised upon an assumption that the judicial identification in the jury\u2019s presence was tainted at the hearing immediately preceding it. During the direct, cross, redirect, and recross examinations of the youthful witness, the circumstances of both her pretrial photographic identification and her judicial identification were brought out before the jury. As Judge Moylan has stated for this Court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b461-6\">\u201cAn in-court identification, as any other evidence, civilly or criminally, may be tested and probed by the traditional device for such testing and probing \u2014 the use of cross-examination.... What happens in the courtroom is open for judge and jury to see and does not call for the Sixth Amendment\u2019s special ventilation of musty and secret station house proceedings.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b461-7\"><em>Green v. State, </em>35 Md. App. 510, 521, 371 A.2d 1112, 1119, <em>reversed on other grounds, </em>281 Md. 483, 380 A.2d 43 (1977). The examination by appellant\u2019s counsel of the witness in this case was rigorous and probing. The jury became aware of the erroneous first identification made out of their presence and could weigh that factor in assessing Darlene\u2019s credibility. Moreover, the court conscientiously afforded the appellant an opportunity to challenge Darlene\u2019s judicial identification before it was revealed to the jury. Upon our independent review of the record, we find no error in allowing Darlene to identify the appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-8\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b461-9\">Over defense objection, thirty-five pictures were introduced into evidence. Appellant contends that because \u201cthe photographs were unnecessary and prejudicial as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>tending to inflame the passions of the jury,\u201d the trial judge abused his discretion in admitting them.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-5\">The admission of photographs is within the discretion of the trial court, and its determination will not be disturbed on appeal unless it clearly abused its discretion in admitting them. <em>Carroll v. State, </em>11 Md. App. 412, 414-15, 274 A.2d 677, 678-79 (1971). <em>See Rasnick v. State, </em>7 Md. App. 564, 569-70, 256 A.2d 543, 546 (1969), <em>cert. denied, </em>400 U.S. 835 (1970); <em>McLaughlin v. State, </em>3 Md. App. 515, 523, 240 A.2d 298, 303 (1967). <em>See also Clarke v. State, </em>238 Md. 11, 207 A.2d 456 (1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b462-6\">Appellant has failed in his brief to indicate the nature of the prejudice claimed as to thirty-one of the thirty-five photographs.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> We are unable to find any error by the trial court in admitting the thirty-one photographs.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-7\">Of the remaining four photographs, two showed the bodies in the positions in which they were originally found and two were autopsy photographs showing the multiple stab wounds. Originally, the State attempted to introduce thirteen photographs showing the bodies at the crime gcene and prior to the autopsy. The record demonstrates that Judge Levin assiduously evaluated each of the thirteen photographs, selecting four that he thought were appropriate. No abuse of discretion is disclosed by the record, and appellant\u2019s contentions to the contrary must fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-8\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b462-9\">The reports of the autopsies performed on the victims and received in evidence contained identical statements that: \u201cThe manner of death is homicide.\u201d Appellant sought to strike those statements at trial prior to the reports being received, and now urges the same point as a basis for a reversal of his convictions on appeal. We find no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-10\">Appellant\u2019s reliance on <em>Benjamin v. Woodring, </em>268 Md. 593, 303 A.2d 779 (1973) is misplaced. In that civil case, the decedent\u2019s death was caused by an overdose of barbiturates; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>the medical examiner\u2019s conclusion of suicide was based on facts extrinsic to the autopsy supplied by Mrs. Benjamin, the plaintiff. Moreover, the manner of death was central to the dispute between the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-5\">The medical examiner\u2019s conclusion in the instant case that the deaths of Carol and Heather Lewis were homicidal was a product of the autopsy examinations themselves without the need for extrinsic evidence. Obviously, the multiple stab wounds inflicted upon both bodies were not accidental, natural, or suicidal; they were, therefore, homicidal. Moreover, the autopsy statements were perfectly consistent with the appellant\u2019s defense. In his opening statement, appellant\u2019s counsel argued: \u201cThere is no question that Mrs. Lewis and Heather Lewis were brutally slain that day in Bowie. There isn\u2019t any dispute over that. Indeed, we readily concede that.\u201d This position was reiterated in the closing argument when appellant\u2019s counsel informed the jury that Mr. Meyer \u201cis not telling you to disregard the fact that poor Mrs. Lewis and her daughter were killed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b463-6\">Since the manner of death was undisputed, leaving appellant\u2019s criminal agency as the primary issue, we think the case fits squarely within our prior decision in <em>Malekar v. State, </em>26 Md. App. 498, 338 A.2d 328 (1978). What Judge Moylan said there, applies with equal force here:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b463-7\">\u201cThe conclusion that the cause of death here was homicidal, stemming from the obvious physical fact of strangulation, was not a product of investigative activity on the part of the Medical Examiner\u2019s Office but was a direct product of the autopsy examination itself. The conclusion, moreover, was completely consonant with the appellant\u2019s theory of the case, since his version of the fatal incident had been that two robbers burst into the home and killed his employer. We see neither error nor prejudice.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b463-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 510, 338 A.2d 334-35. Similarly, in this case we see no error and it is obvious that appellant has suffered no prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>VI</p>\n<p id=\"b464-5\">Appellant objects to the seizure by Prince George\u2019s County Police of his 1974 Maverick parked in his mother-in-law\u2019s driveway in Arlington, Virginia. Specifically, he contends that \u201cthe initial warrantless seizure of the car in Virginia was illegal, and tainted the subsequent search pursuant to the warrant in Prince George\u2019s County.\u201d The record unequivocally demonstrates that the police obtained the express permission of Hortensia Meyer, appellant\u2019s wife, for the seizure of the automobile. It is uncontroverted that Mrs. Meyer was a co-owner of the automobile. As such, she had the authority to consent to her automobile being towed from Virginia to Maryland. Appellant\u2019s objection to the seizure is without merit. <em>Wade v. Warden, </em>278 F. Supp. 904 (D. Md. 1968); <em>United States v. Carter, </em>569 F.2d 801 (4th Cir. 1977), <em>cert. denied, </em>435 U.S. 973 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b464-6\">VII</p>\n<p id=\"b464-7\">During the early stages of the trial, the State attempted to introduce the search warrants, applications therefor, and supporting affidavits that had been obtained for the search of appellant\u2019s apartment and automobile. Contained within the applications was the confession of Lon Lewis that incriminated the appellant. In proffering the materials, the State indicated that it wanted to \u201cshow this jury that the police didn\u2019t go like storm troopers into that home.\u201d Appellant objected to the introduction of the materials. The court agreed with appellant and refused to admit them; however, as a compromise it instructed the jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b464-8\">\u201cAll right, ladies and gentlemen of the jury, there were two exhibits, 44 and 45. One is a search warrant for a car. And the other warrant is a search warrant for a premises. I am not going to admit these search warrants, but I instruct you that these search warrants were issued by two separate judges and signed by them to be issued. And they were executed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b464-9\">And I further instruct you that no search warrant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>is issued by a judge, either here or in Montgomery County, and this is applicable to both of these search warrants, that they are only issued based upon probable cause.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b465-5\">It is the appellant\u2019s contention that the instruction was improper \u201c[especially since the technical concept of \u2018probable cause\u2019 was not explained to the jury----\u201d He claims that the jury could have been misled to his prejudice into believing that the issuance of the search warrants was evidence of his guilt.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-8\">We believe that it would have been preferable for the trial court to have omitted any reference to probable cause or, once having made such a reference, to have explained its technical meaning to the jury. Nevertheless, we do not find that the instruction as given constitutes error. The authority cited by appellant, <em>Dempsey v. State, </em>277 Md. 134, 355 A.2d 455 (1976), is inapposite. There the court informed the jury of the court\u2019s finding that a confession was voluntary, an issue which the jury had the duty ultimately to decide for itself. Here the instruction, coming early in the trial, in no way usurped or interfered with the jury\u2019s role. Furthermore, there was extensive prior testimony, to which no objection was made, that both warrants had been \u201capproved\u201d by a judge. We find no prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-9\">\n<em>Judgments affirmed; costs to be paid by appellant</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b450-8\">. After the trial of the appellant herein, Mr. Lewis was tried and convicted as an accessory before the fact to the murders for which the appellant has been convicted as the principal. Mr. Lewis\u2019 conviction was recently reversed by the Court of Appeals, and the case was remanded for a new trial. Lewis v. State, 285 Md. 705, 404 A.2d 1073 (1979).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b450-9\">. Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436 (1966).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b451-9\">. M.D.R. 723 (b) (2) provides that the \u201cjudicial officer shall require the defendant to read the advice of right to counsel printed on the charging document...\u201d and \u201cshall certify in writing that the defendant has read the advice as to the right of counsel in his presence ....\u201d Commissioner O\u2019Brien did make such a certification. The contents of the advice are prescribed by M.D.R. 711 (a) and were accurately reproduced in the charging document in the instant case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b452-7\">. There were several conflicts between the police officers and the appellant in the testimony presented at the pretrial suppression hearings. Mr. Meyer testified that the police continually called him \u201cCrazy Man\u201d; told him he had no rights; denied him food, the use of bathroom facilities, and access to a telephone; and hit him on the head whenever he asked for an attorney. This testimony was flatly contradicted by the testimony of Officers Hatfield and Morrissette. Judge Levin chose to believe the police officers\u2019 version. The credibility of witnesses at a pretrial suppression hearing is for the determination of the trial judge, Boone v. State, 2 Md. App. 80, 95-96, 233 A.2d 476, 485 (1967), subject to reversal only for a manifest abuse of discretion. <em>See </em>Watson v. State, 282 Md. 73, 84, 382 A.2d 574, 580, <em>cert. denied, </em>437 U.S. 908 (1978); Smith v. State, 20 Md. App. 577, 585-86, 318 A.2d 568, 574-75 (1974), <em>cert. denied, </em>420 U.S. 909 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b452-8\">At trial the jury also heard the conflicting testimony concerning the treatment of the appellant by the police. We note that the appellant does not, on appeal, challenge the voluntariness of his statements or the adequacy of his waiver of his <em>Miranda </em>rights.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b453-10\">. It may seem anomalous that the appellant is seeking to exclude a largely exculpatory statement. As we read the broad language of the <em>Johnson </em>case, it applies to \u201cany statement\u201d given to the police in violation of M.D.R. 723 without regard to the statement\u2019s content. <em>Id. </em>at 328, 384 A.2d at 717. We note, as did the Supreme Court that \u201cno distinction may be drawn between inculpatory statements and statements alleged to be merely \u2018exculpatory.\u2019 If a statement made were in fact truly exculpatory it would, of course, never be used by the prosecution.\u201d Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436, 477 (1966), <em>quoted in </em>Milhouse v. State, 31 Md. App. 571, 576, 358 A.2d 262, 265 (1976).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b454-7\">. We note that the Court of Appeals in <em>Lewis </em>found a six and one-half hour delay to be necessary where its sole purpose was to transcribe a confession given by the defendant <em>prior </em>to his arrest. Lewis v. State, 285 Md. 705, 404 A.2d 1073 (1979). Of course, a totally different situation is presented where, as in the instant case, the arrest <em>precedes </em>any questioning leading to a statement or confession.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b455-8\">. The prior statement, taken two days before appellant\u2019s arrest, was admitted into evidence; the appellant does not, on appeal, challenge its admission.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b456-9\">. Because of our disposition of the issues under M.D.R. 723 we do not consider the State\u2019s argument that the <em>Johnson </em>case should be applied prospectively only. Accordingly, we express no view at this time on the merits of the State\u2019s argument. <em>Cf. </em>Shope v. State, 41 Md. App. 161, 396 A.2d 282 (1979). In Lewis v. State, 285 Md. 705, 404 A.2d 1073 (1979), the same argument was addressed to the Court of Appeals but the Court in its disposition of the case found it unnecessary to decide the question.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b459-9\">. The trial judge conducted suppression hearings both before trial and during trial; he concluded that there was no primary illegality that would taint the judicial identification of the appellant by Darlene Brown. <em>Cf. </em>Green v. State, 281 Md. 483, 380 A.2d 43 (1977).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b462-11\">. These were pictures of the crime scene, the appellant\u2019s automobile, and the appellant.
