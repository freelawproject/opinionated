Costs to be paid by appellee. The mandate shall issue forthwith.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b297-14\">We now explain why we took that action.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-15\">This is the story of Treasure Mountain. It is the saga of Jesse T. Crowder\u2019s venture into real estate development of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>his own small tract of property and his entanglement in the regulations of the Maryland Department of Health and Mental Hygiene.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The complex web of governmental rules, the Department\u2019s denial of permission to use septic tank sewage in the venture, together with the resultant administrative appeals, must have at times seemed to Crowder to have removed all expectation of \u201cTreasure\u201d from the Mountain. Indeed, \u201cTreasure Mountain\u201d might be better named \u201cHeartbreak Hill.\u201d The Circuit Court for Frederick County cut through the strands of the regulatory web, reversed the decision of the Secretary of Health and Mental Hygiene as well as that Department\u2019s Board of Review, and placed its judicial stamp of approval on Crowder\u2019s project.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-5\">Unmistakably aggrieved by the circuit court\u2019s action, the Secretary appealed. We, after discussion with counsel for the parties litigant, <em>sua sponte </em>advanced the matter for hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-6\">The Secretary vigorously asserts to us that \u201cthe denial of subdivision approval\u201d by the agency over which he presides was \u201cin accordance with legally sufficient regulatory standards,\u201d and that the denial was \u201csupported by substantial evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b298-7\">The facts giving birth to this appeal commenced with plans to subdivide sixteen acres of land located in Frederick County into sixteen residential building lots.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Four of the lots failed to pass the necessary percolation test,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and two lots were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>combined into one because of the slope of the lots. The percolation tests were relatively fast.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> As a result of the tests, the subdivision was reduced to eleven lots on the final revised plat that was submitted to the Supervisor of the Environmental Health Services of the Frederick County Health Department. The Supervisor disapproved the plat and Crowder set out on his journey to court.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>First he appealed to the Deputy State Health Officer of Frederick County. Following a lack of success at that level, Crowder appealed to the Secretary of the Maryland Department of Health and Mental Hygiene. The Secretary designated a hearing officer to conduct the hearing and make recommendations to the Secretary. Upon receipt of the hearing officer\u2019s findings and recommendations, the Secretary affirmed the Deputy State Health Officer\u2019s disapproval of the subdivision plan. Crowder then appealed to the Board of Review of the State Health and Mental Hygiene Department.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Following oral argument, the Board of Review affirmed the order of the Secretary and adopted the findings of fact and conclusions of the hearing officer. Once more Crowder appealed. He sought relief in the Frederick County Circuit Court. That tribunal agreed with Crowder. It found that the hearing officer\u2019s findings of fact were not supported by the record before her, and that \u201cthere was no evidence in the case that could reasonably sustain the decision\u201d of the Secretary. Accordingly, the court reversed the Secretary and \u201capproved\u201d the subdivision.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-5\">Before we begin our discussion of the law, certain fundamental principles applicable to appeals from administrative agencies must be recalled:</p>\n<p id=\"b300-6\">1. Judicial review of decisions made by an administrative board is narrow in scope because of the recognized expertise of the board in a particular field of endeavor. <em>Annapolis v. Annapolis Waterfront Co., </em>284 Md. 383. 395, 396 A.2d 1080, 1087 (1979); <em>Finney v. Halle, </em>241 Md. 224, 241, 216 A.2d 530, 539 (1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b300-7\">2. Decisions of administrative boards carry a presumption of validity and will not be disturbed on appeal if there is a showing within the record of substantial evidence to sustain the findings. <em>Heaps v. Cobb, </em>185 Md. 372, 378-79, 45 A.2d 73, 76 (1945); <em>Commissioner v. Cason, </em>34 Md. App. 487, 499, 368 A.2d 1067, 1074, <em>cert. denied, </em>280 Md. 728 (1977); <em>Toland v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number><em>State Board of Education, </em>35 Md. App. 389, 395-96, 371 A.2d 161, 164-65 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b301-5\">3. State administrative \u201cagencies are created in order to perform activities which the Legislature deems desirable and necessary\u201d to further the public health, safety, welfare, and morals. <em>Department of Natural Resources v. Linchester, </em>274 Md. 211, 222, 334 A.2d 514, 522 (1975); <em>Commissioner v. Cason, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b301-6\">4. With or without legislative enactment, courts have an inherent constitutional duty to review, within limits,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> decisions of administrative bodies. <em>Department of Natural Resources v. Linchester, supra; Baltimore Import Car v. Maryland Port Authority, </em>258 Md. 335, 342-43, 265 A.2d 866, 869-70 (1970); <em>Commissioner v. Cason, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b301-7\">5. The powers vested in the courts, by statute or inherence, to review administrative decisions does not carry with it the right to substitute its fact finding process for that of an agency. <em>Oxon Hill Recreation Club v. Water Resources Administration, </em>281 Md. 110, 114, 375 A.2d 567, 569 (1977); <em>Insurance Commissioner v. National Bureau, </em>248 Md. 292, 309-10, 236 A .2d 282, 291-92 (1967); <em>Snowden v. Mayor and City Council of Baltimore, </em>224 Md. 443, 445, 168 A.2d 390, 391 (1961); <em>Toland v. State Board of Education, supra; Nelson v. Real Estate Commission, </em>35 Md. App. 334, 344-45, 370 A.2d 608, 615, <em>cert. denied, </em>280 Md. 733 (1977); <em>Commissioner v. Cason, supra. See also, </em>Prof. E. A. Tomlinson, <em>Constitutional Limits on the Decisional Powers of Courts and Administrative Agencies in Maryland, </em>35 Md. L. R. 414 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b301-8\">6. The court will correct illegal, arbitrary, and unreasonable acts of the administrative agencies \u201cbecause those acts are not based on substantial evidence.\u201d <em>Snowden v. Mayor and City Council of Baltimore, supra, </em>224 Md. at 445; <em>Commissioner v. Cason, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b301-9\">7. The court may not set aside a decision of an administrative agency merely because the court might weigh <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>the evidence differently. <em>Johnstown Coal &amp; Coke Co. v. </em>Dishong, 198 Md. 467. 476, 84 A.2d 847. 851 (1951). <em>See also Board v. Oak Hill </em>Farms, 232 Md. 274, 192 A.2d 761 (1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b302-5\">An excellent and relatively brief summary of the functions of the courts in reviewing a decision of an administrative agency was penned by Judge Jerrold V. Powers for this Court in the <em>Cason </em>case:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Azi\"><em>\u201cA </em>reviewing court may, and should, examine any inference, drawn by an agency, of the existence of a fact not shown by direct proof, to see if that inference reasonably follows from other facts which are shown by direct proof. If it does, even though the agency might reasonably have drawn a different inference, the court has no power to disagree with the fact so inferred.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b302-7\">A reviewing court may, and should, examine any conclusion reached by an agency, to see whether reasoning minds could reasonably reach that conclusion from facts in the record before the agency, by direct proof, or by permissible inference. If the conclusion could be so reached, then it is based upon substantial evidence, and the court has no power to reject that conclusion.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b302-9\">A reviewing court may, and should, examine facts found by an agency, to see if there was evidence to support each fact found. If there was evidence of the fact in the record before the agency, no matter how conflicting, or how questionable the credibility, of the source of the evidence, the court has no power to substitute its assessment of credibility for that made by the agency, and by doing so, reject the fact.\u201d 34 Md. App. at 508.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b302-10\">We turn now to the case <em>sub judice.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b302-11\">While the hearing examiner's findings are not, in our view, as factually comprehensive as they should have been and, thus, invited the circuit court\u2019s reversal, the record, when reviewed, shows that the examiner was correct, even if for the wrong reason.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>There was evidence that, although the majority of the lots passed the percolation test,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> the \u201crock formulation\u201d in the area where the septic systems were to be located would not fulfill the expectations of a septic system. In short the sewage would not be properly attenuated before it reached ground water.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-5\">Mr. Robert T. Dutrow, Supervisor of the Environmental Health Department for Frederick County, testified that he had been performing that \u201csort of work\u201d for \u201c[nineteen and a half years.\u201d He personally examined Treasure Mountain on several occasions. It was Mr. Dutrow\u2019s judgment that the septic system was not satisfactory if there were to be wells for water rather than a public water system. Dutrow believed that the proposed sewerage system might result in the infiltration of the ground water. He opined that it was the Health Department\u2019s job \u201cto do its utmost to protect the public health and not wait until a contamination exists.\u201d Dutrow said that in an area such as that of Treasure Mountain, with its \u201cfast percolation\u201d that \u201cthere is more possibility for the water supply to be contaminated....\u201d The witness further stated that with a rocky soil structure such as here that septic system\u2019s effluent is \u201cmore apt to reach the water supply in an unfiltered state.\u201d He repeated that in his \u201copinion\u201d there was a possibility of contamination of the water supply if the septic system as proposed was put on the lots. Dutrow also noted that other developments in the area had experienced \u201cproblems\u201d with \u201ccontaminated water.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b303-6\">Another witness, Mr. Harry F. Sandberg, told the hearing examiner that he was \u201ca Regional Consultant with the Environmental Health Administration, State Health Department.\u201d Mr. Sandberg testified that a fast percolation rate \u201cin a fractured rock area [such as that at Treasure Mountain]\u201d is essentially because of channery material. \u201cChannery material,\u201d Mr. Sandberg defined as \u201ccobblestones.\u201d He expressed the opinion that when \u201cyou have these various fast rates [for percolation], you are not going to get the renovation [of waste] and that sewage is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>essentially going to get into the ground water in inner spaces of the rocks without any attenuation.\u201d The witness went on to say that:</p>\n<p id=\"b304-5\">\u201cI believe that if the subdivision was [,s/c] built, I think [that] within a reasonable period of time we would have problems with the wells because there is not going to be any renovation. The sewage is going to get into the inner spaces of the rock. The fractures [in the rocks] are hydrologically connected. It doesn\u2019t matter where the wells are. If you don't have that renovation of the sewage, then you can\u2019t be sure that the quality of the water will be of a potable<footnotemark>[8]</footnotemark> quality.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b304-7\">We think the reasonable inference to be drawn from the testimony of Messrs. Dutrow and Sandberg is that because of the strata of the soil, there is a definite possibility that the proposed septic systems will contaminate the proposed wells with unattenuated human waste.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-8\">The trial judge saw the record as not containing the necessary substantial evidence to support the Secretary\u2019s findings. We, however, view the record differently. We think that the testimony of Messrs. Dutrow and Sandberg was sufficient to satisfy the substantial evidence test applicable to proceedings before administrative bodies. At minimum, the issue was \u201cfairly debatable.\u201d In our opinion, the circuit court erred in holding that there was no such evidence. It appears that the circuit judge did not believe the State\u2019s witnesses, or else he could not have reached the conclusion that he did. In any event it is clear to us that the judge substituted his judgment for that of the agency, and that he may not do.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-9\">Crowder suggests, indeed, he urges, that we hold that when the percolation test is passed, it is unreasonable for the Department of Health to deny a permit. The \u201cperk test,\u201d he advances, satisfies the rule and there is nothing else for the Department to do but ministerially issue the necessary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>permit. We, however, have an entirely different point of view.</p>\n<p id=\"Akz\">COMAR 10.17.03.03 A provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b305-5\"><em>\"In all subdivisions, individual water supply and sewage disposal facilities may be permitted when in conformance with the county plan and where the following acceptable physical conditions are present: topography, soil types, surface and subsurface drainage, and the absence of a fluctuating high water table. </em>These determinations shall be based upon available information which shall include the history of individual water supply and individual sewerage systems, information obtained from the soil survey for the jurisdiction, standard percolation tests, available geologic and hydrologic data and any other information which may be available.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b305-6\">The rule makes unmistakable that the passing of the percolation test is not the end of the matter. It is only one of the factors, among many, to be considered. Moreover, in those instances where a preliminary plan is submitted by the developer, a subdivision <em>\"may not be considered, where, in the opinion of the approving authority, the infiltration of individual sewerage system wastes may result in the contamination of the ground water. \u201d </em>COMAR 10.17.03.02 A. (Emphasis supplied.) A reference to the testimony of Messrs. Dutrow and Sandberg, above, indicates that the \u201capproving authority\u201d was of the opinion that the individual sewerage systems as proposed by Crowder might result in contamination of the ground water. That testimony, if believed, justified the Department\u2019s refusal to issue the necessary permits. The hearing officer, Secretary, and Board of Review did not err in affirming that Department\u2019s declination to issue the permit. The circuit court erred in reversing that decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-7\">\n<em>Judgment reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b305-8\">\n<em>Costs to be paid by appellee.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b298-8\">.
