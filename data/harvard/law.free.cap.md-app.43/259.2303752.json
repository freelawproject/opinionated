The trial did not take place as scheduled, however, essentially because the State\u2019s evidence \u2014 in the possession of the Baltimore Police Department Arson Squad \u2014 was subpoenaed approximately 2 weeks before the trial date by the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey in connection with a grand jury investigation in that jurisdiction of the same occurrence.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Nine months and 23 days from the date of Mr. Hiken\u2019s arrest, the court below (Allen, J.) granted appellee\u2019s second motion to dismiss for lack of a speedy trial. The State seeks a reversal. Finding no error, we will affirm.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b280-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b280-6\">There was no evidentiary hearing below. Appellee\u2019s motion to dismiss for lack of a speedy trial was granted at the last <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>of five proceedings in open court<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> on June 30, 1978 after extensive colloquies between court and counsel and upon a proffer of evidence with which the State substantially agreed. The operative facts may be summarized as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b281-5\">Appellee, Stanley Hiken, conducted a formal men\u2019s wear business in Baltimore City. In connection with this business, Hiken maintained a warehouse for formal wear storage at 1640 East Baltimore Street which was owned by S. Hiken Formal Wear, Inc. A fire occurred at the warehouse on December 11,1976. A 9-month investigation into the fire was conducted by the Office of the State\u2019s Attorney and the Arson Squad of the Baltimore City Police Department. During this 9-month period, Mr. Hiken\u2019s records were subpoenaed as were members of his family and other individuals who appeared and testified before the grand jury. Mr. Hiken ultimately was charged, in four separate indictments, with arson of the warehouse,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> conspiracy,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> solicitation, and insurance fraud.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b281-6\">On September 7, 1977, the date of the indictments, Hiken was arrested at his place of business in the 3600 block of Eastern Avenue in Baltimore City. Detective John Dillon of the Arson Squad took him from his establishment in handcuffs and drove him to the Southeastern District of the Baltimore City Police Department. There, after the prosecution pressed for the surrender of his passport, he was released on his own recognizance.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-7\">A trial date was set for December 19,1977. In November, the United States District Court for the District of New <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>Jersey<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> subpoenaed appellee\u2019s business records.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> An Assistant United States Attorney in New Jersey, Thomas McKay, III, was aware of Mr. Hiken\u2019s Maryland trial date. Nevertheless, at a meeting in his office in Camden, New Jersey on December 7,1977,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> attended by appellee\u2019s counsel, James F. Murphy, Jr., by Assistant State\u2019s Attorney Haven Kodeck of Baltimore City, and Detective John Dillon of the Baltimore City Police Department, Mr. McKay served a subpoena <em>duces tecum </em>upon Detective Dillon, returnable before the grand jury in Camden on December 13, 1977. Mr. Dillon was ordered to bring \u201call documents, reports, physical evidence, or other materials in [his] possession pertaining to the investigation of a fire at 1640 E[ast] Baltimore Street, Baltimore, Maryland, on 12/11/76.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b282-5\">Detective Dillon delivered documentary and physical evidence to the New Jersey grand jury on December 13,1977, as required by the subpoena. Thereupon, Mr. Kodeck indicated to Mr. Murphy that a request for a change of Mr. Hiken\u2019s trial date of December 19, 1977 would be made. No motion was filed. Mr. Murphy requested a formal hearing, on the record, in the chambers of'the Honorable Anselm Sodaro, then Administrative Judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-6\">\n<em>Proceedings before Judge Sodaro, December 16, 1977.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b282-7\">Appellee\u2019s counsel assured Judge Sodaro that he was ready and desirous to proceed to trial. The court suggested to Mr. Kodeck that xerox copies of the State\u2019s evidence be obtained but the latter responded that copies could not be provided \u201cat this late date.\u201d With extreme reluctance, Judge Sodaro removed the case from the-.trial calendar, preserving, however, the December 19th trial date for the hearing of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>motions, filed on December 14th and December 16th, to dismiss all but the arson indictment. Judge Sodaro stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-6\"><em>\u201cImust agree with counsel\\ for both parties, that the United States Attorney acted highhandedly, and not only did he act high-handedly, but he has, in fact, caused embarrassment to the defense and the State, and the administration of justice of this city, because, obviously, it\u2019s an important case. It was especially set for trial for a particular court.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b283-7\">He also stated that upon the return of the evidence from New Jersey, forecast by Mr. Kodeck for the following month, he would \u201cmake available, the Court to which this case has been assigned, Criminal Court Part XI, at anytime, even including the postponement of cases and assignments that have been scheduled for the Court so that this case may proceed expeditiously.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b283-8\">\n<em>Proceedings before Judge Allen, December 19, 1977.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b283-9\">When appellee\u2019s motions came on for consideration by the court (Allen, J.) on December 19,1977 \u2014 the date which was to have been the trial date \u2014 counsel for Mr. Hiken informed the court at the outset that his motions were addressed to the related charges but not the \u201csubstantive indictment,\u201d the arson indictment. He said, \u201cWe request an immediate trial on that issue.\u201d Subsequently, he informed Judge Allen: \u201c[I] sincerely believe that my client is entitled to an immediate trial. The defense is ready to proceed and indicated to the chief judge on Friday that we were ready to proceed.\u201d The court observed that the matters presented were of some complexity and that the State should file a reply. The State requested, and received, a period of <em>three weeks </em>for that purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-10\">\n<em>Proceedings before Judge Allen, January 17, 1978.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b283-11\">When the case came again before the court on the pending <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>motions on January 17, 1978, Judge Allen stated at the very outset:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b284-5\">\u201cMr. Kodeck, Mr. Murphy has made his position very clear, he insists on trial for his client, as he calls it, <em>immediate trial. \u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b284-6\">The State then advised the court that it had been <em>unable to complete the research necessary to respond to the defense\u2019s motions. </em>An additional two-week period of time was requested. Judge Allen granted the request but ordered that \u201cthe material\u201d be submitted to him by January 31 and that the hearing be held on February 7th. Before the conclusion of the proceedings, counsel for Mr. Hiken restated his objections to the original postponement of the trial and informed Judge Allen of the proceedings in New Jersey which had been the occasion of the change of the trial date by Judge Sodaro. Counsel stated that \u201cextraordinary cause\u201d within the meaning of Rule 746 had not been shown and that the State should have moved to quash the subpoena served upon Detective Dillon. The court ordered that a transcript of the proceedings before Judge Sodaro be obtained. The court also ruled, \u201cat this time I\u2019m going to deny Mr. Murphy\u2019s motion for an immediate trial. I guess it it\u2019s a motion for speedy trial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b284-7\"><em>Proceedings before Judge </em>Allen, <em>February 8, 1978.</em><footnotemark><em>11</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b284-8\">The court, having read the State\u2019s memorandum in response to appellee\u2019s pending motions addressed to the indictment charging conspiracy, solicitation, and insurance fraud, questioned the State\u2019s Attorney and defense counsel extensively with respect to the matters of law and fact involved before taking the' motions under advisement. He assured counsel that he would rule expeditiously upon the motions.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Before adjournment, the court inquired of counsel whether the case had been continued indefinitely by Judge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>Sodaro or merely \u201cpostponed.\u201d The State replied, \u201cIt was just continued until such time as the evidence that was subpoenaed from [the] Baltimore City Police Department to [the] New Jersey authorities was returned to the Baltimore City Police Department.\u201d Counsel for the defendant confirmed this statement but added, \u201cBut it\u2019s a situation, I think, you know, a rose by any other name and regardless of whether it\u2019s characterized as a postponement or a continuance, I continue to insist upon an immediate trial for my client and have done so at every juncture.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b285-5\">The court then rejoined:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b285-6\">\u201cMr. Murphy [defense counsel], it\u2019s very clear that you are laying the groundwork brick-by-brick. You always ask for an immediate trial and what I\u2019m concerned about is this: maybe I really shouldn\u2019t be concerned about it but we don\u2019t have any control over this continuance if we are dependent upon another jurisdiction and another court system to release some documents and we are now, how many months since indictment?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b285-7\">MR. MURPHY: September was the indictment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b285-8\">THE COURT: September 7th, October, November, December, January, five months, <em>and with Mr. Murphy insisting very strongly at every meeting, insisting on an immediate trial we may be moving towards the point that our courts are going to say that, appellate courts are going to say that a continuance is a postponement. </em>I really think. I don\u2019t know what could be done about it <em>but it seems to me the State ought to make some sort of demand for the return of these records. I think the burden is on the state to make some motion in that direction.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b285-9\">Have you done that as yet?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b285-10\">MR. <em>KODECK-.Not as yet, Your Honor. I believe that the prospects of getting them back are very imminent.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b285-11\">THE COURT: Because when Mr. Murphy gets up around six months he\u2019s going to be talking about <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>speedy trial and things like that and I don\u2019t know what the Court of Appeals would do in a situation where we have allowed, not we, but the State has allowed instruments to get out of its hands that delay the trial and have not insisted on getting them back. So, I\u2019ll dispose of all your motions within a day or so and let you know.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b286-5\">MR. MURPHY: Thank you, Your Honor. Again, the issue where the evidence is and why it\u2019s unavailable to the State has again come up and Your Honor is familiar with the history of how it got there and the prejudicial effect it has on my client as proffered the last time we were in court. So, it is for that reason that I request that the indictment be dismissed and that the dismissal order entered very shortly.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b286-6\">THE COURT: I will rule on your motions. That\u2019s the best I can do. I will rule on your motions \u2014.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b286-7\">The court\u2019s ruling on the motions was almost immediately forthcoming. On February 15,1978, Judge Allen (a) dismissed the indictment charging solicitation to commit arson; (b) denied the motion to dismiss the insurance fraud indictment; (c) denied a motion to suppress certain financial records allegedly acquired contrary to Md. Ann. Code art. 11, \u00a7\u00a7 224-227 (Supp. 1978); and (d) denied the motion to dismiss the conspiracy indictment, granting the State leave to amend that indictment \u201cby interlineation to add the names of co-conspirators whose identities were known or should have been known to the Grand Jury at the time of indictment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b286-8\">\n<em>Further Motions to Dismiss Indictments.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b286-9\">On March 2, 1978, counsel for Mr. Hiken filed a motion to dismiss the remaining three indictments, claiming that the State\u2019s \u201caction and inaction\u201d had violated Mr. Hiken\u2019s right to a speedy trial. The motion stated in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b286-10\">\u201c7. Nearly six months have passed since the Defendant has been indicted, and the State has taken <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>no action to set these charges for trial on the merits. Defendant again alleges that none of the postponements or continuances requested by the State have been for \u2018extraordinary cause\u2019 within the meaning of the above-captioned Rule [746 (b)] because <em>the State has taken no steps to prevent the actions of the federal government which the State alleges to have caused its inability to present its case to a trier o f fact. \u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b287-6\">The record contains no response by the State to this motion. It appears that some time in March the evidence was returned by the New Jersey federal authorities. We are told that the defendant\u2019s counsel was not informed of their receipt. The record does not reflect any action by the State, at that juncture, to obtain a new trial date in accordance with Judge Sodaro\u2019s instructions of December 16, 1977.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-7\">On May 2, 1978, essentially on the basis of a denial of due process, counsel for Hiken filed a motion to dismiss the indictments and a comprehensive supporting memorandum. The principal grounds for the motion were that: (1) one Monty Artwell, who had previously given testimony under oath before the Baltimore grand jury, and whom Mr. Hiken intended to subpoena as a witness, had given false testimony in New Jersey involving the fire and was subject to a perjury indictment there;<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> and (2) the Maryland State authorities and the New Jersey federal authorities were \u201cengaged in a joint investigation which caused the first postponement of this case and subsequent violations of Defendant\u2019s rights.\u201d The latter violations, as particularized in the motion, were serious, alleging that: State and federal authorities were engaged in an abuse of the grand jury process, the end result of which was to enable Maryland authorities to gather evidence for criminal charges pending before the Criminal Court of Baltimore, which it would not otherwise constitutionally be able to obtain. \u201cThe facts of the instant case clearly cry out for the intervention of this Honorable Court,\u201d the memorandum insisted.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>Judge Allen instructed the State to respond in writing. Although a reply memorandum was apparently submitted, it is not contained in the record before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-5\">On June 22, 1978, however, Hiken filed a \u201cSecond Motion To Dismiss For Lack Of Speedy Trial,\u201d in which it was stated that the State\u2019s answer to the defendant\u2019s May 2nd motion \u201csimply argued that the matters raised therein be deferred until trial.\u201d Appellee\u2019s motion continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b288-6\">\u201cSpecifically and of paramount importance to the instant Motion, the State\u2019s response to the aforegoing Motion mentions <em>absolutely nothing </em>about the Defendant\u2019s claim that the office of the State\u2019s Attorney for Baltimore City and the Baltimore City Police Department has engaged in a deliberate strategy to delay the trial in order to work with the office of the United States Attorney for the District of New Jersey in the hope that the latter law-enforcement agency shall develop evidence not now in the possession of the State. Therefore, the Defendant\u2019s allegations must be taken as true for purposes of the Court\u2019s disposition of this Motion.\u201d (Emphasis in original.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b288-7\">\n<em>Proceedings before Judge Allen, June 30, 1978.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b288-8\">In open court on June 30,1978,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> extensive colloquies again took place between the court and counsel with respect to the pending motions. During the course of this hearing, Hiken\u2019s counsel complained again, as he had at virtually every other hearing, that the action of the federal authorities in New Jersey not only made possible the discovery of evidence against Mr. Hiken which normally would not have been available to the State, but that it was also contrary to stated policy of the Department of Justice in connection with the exercise of the power to prosecute a defendant under both <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>federal and state law for the same act or acts. <em>See Claybrooks v. State, </em>36 Md. App. 295, 304-05, n. 5, 374 A.2d 365, 371 (1977). That policy, as disclosed in <em>Claybrooks, </em>was based upon a 1959 Memorandum to United States Attorneys from then Attorney General William O. Rogers. It stated that the power to conduct a federal prosecution after a State prosecution \"has been used sparingly by the Department of Justice in the past. The purpose of this memorandum is to insure that in the future we continue that policy. After a State prosecution there should be no federal trial for the same act or acts unless the reasons are compelling.\u201d The federal policy, as represented to the lower court by counsel for Hiken, was, however, that \u201conce there\u2019s a completed State prosecution' the Justice Department will not permit an indictment unless the Attorney General himself authorizes it, so had this case proceeded to trial on December 19, 1977, for better or for worse, whatever the result was for Mr. Hiken, the Justice Department\u2019s policy would have precluded his indictment in New Jersey absent the actual written authorization of the Attorney General of the United States.\u201d The latter statement is not supported by the policy memorandum quoted above from the opinion of this Court in Claybrooks,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b289-5\">As previously indicated, there was no evidentiary hearing on June 30, 1978, but counsel for the defendant made a proffer of facts with which the State substantially concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>At the conclusion of the hearing, appellee\u2019s due process motion filed on May 2, 1978 was denied. The second motion to dismiss for lack of a speedy trial filed on June 22,1978 was granted. The court observed that what \u201cmakes the nine months different from any other nine months was the loss to the federal authorities of the evidence required to proceed here, when they really didn\u2019t have to do it and when they could have fought the subpoena and went ahead and tried his case.\u201d Judge Allen concluded that the Barker<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> analysis had been triggered, that appellee\u2019s right to a speedy trial had been repeatedly asserted and that the State\u2019s Attorney had not rebutted the presumption of prejudice which arose from the 9-month, 23-day delay. In so concluding, Judge Allen stated in part from the bench:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b290-5\">\u201cThe State has failed to even suggest or the State has suggested there\u2019s no prejudice, but there is a substantial representation by the defense that prejudice is very substantial, <em>and in fact the defense feels that the Defendant is going to be indicted almost momentarily, and that once he is indicted the prejudice will be insurmountable because then he will stand for trial in two jurisdictions, perhaps. </em>And the defense attaches even more lurid motiyes to the State\u2019s saying what they intend to do is simply to hold Mr. Hiken in some sort of suspended animation down here in Maryland until he\u2019s indicted in New Jersey and nol pros the cases down here.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b290-6\">Of course, that is just speculation; isn\u2019t it, Mr. Murphy, speculation. <em>But the facts come through loud and clear that this case is nine months old, almost ten months old and that the Defendant at the behest of another jurisdiction without ever any attempt to fight the seizure, not seizure, but the subpoenaing of certain documents to protect its own prosecution has allowed the case to be delayed a very substantial length of time,</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b290-7\">I think the delay is prejudicial, and I\u2019m going to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>grant the Defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss on the grounds of denial of speedy trial.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b291-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b291-6\">As we noted at the outset,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> the Court of Appeals in <em>State v. Hicks, </em>No. 130, Sept. Term, 1978 (filed June 25,1979), and on motion for reconsideration, filed July 19, 1979, has held that Maryland Rule 746 is mandatory and not directory but that this new interpretation is \u201centirely prospective.\u201d In cases like the instant appeal, not affected by the court\u2019s holding, Rule 746 remains directory only, not mandatory. The starting point, in our appraisal of the State\u2019s claims of error, is the familiar case of <em>Barker v. Wingo, </em>407 U.S. 514 (1972).<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> The court in <em>Barker </em>held that four factors should be balanced in determining whether a defendant has been denied a speedy trial: the \u201clength of delay; the reason for the delay; the defendant\u2019s assertion of the right; and prejudice to the defendant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 530.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-7\">\n<em>1. Length of Delay.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b291-8\">The duration of the delay is the mechanism which triggers the analysis and is itself one of the factors to be balanced. <em>State v. Wilson, </em>35 Md. App. 111, 371 A.2d 140 (1977), <em>aff\u2019d, </em>281 Md. 640, 382 A.2d 1053 (1978), <em>cert. denied, </em>439 U.S. 839 (1978). Here, the period of delay extends from September 7, 1977, the date when Mr. Hiken was indicted and arrested, to at least June 30,1978, when his motion to dismiss for lack of a speedy trial was granted, a period of 9 months and 23 days.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b292-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>We firmly reject the State\u2019s contention that the delay is not of constitutional dimension. As <em>Barker </em>held, \u201c[T]he length of delay that will provoke such an inquiry is necessarily dependent on the peculiar circumstances of the case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 530-31. While the State correctly points out that the crimes charged here were not \u201cordinary street crimes\u201d but crimes of greater complexity, it fails utterly to acknowledge the fact that a 9-month investigation by the police arson squad and the Office of the State\u2019s Attorney had preceded Mr. Hiken\u2019s indictment and arrest. Under these circumstances, the State was, or certainly should have been, ready for trial within a very short time after the indictments and the almost 10-month period involved is surely of constitutional dimension.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">\n<em>2. Reason for the Delay.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b292-6\">A \u201cbrooding omnipresence\u201d here is the subpoena issued by the United States District Court in New Jersey, almost two weeks before the trial date of December 19th in Part X of the Criminal Court of Baltimore. As we read the record, the Office of the State\u2019s Attorney for Baltimore City capitulated to an Assistant United States Attorney in Camden, New Jersey, showing little consideration for the orderly administration of justice in Maryland. We find no evidence that the top echelons of the Office of the State\u2019s Attorney of Baltimore City were in any way involved or concerned. It does <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>not appear that any effort was made, at appropriate levels, to moderate the demands of the Camden office so as to postpone compliance with the subpoena until after the trial in Maryland had occurred. No motion to quash was, it appears, even contemplated. Detective Dillon had no alternative but to deliver to the Camden office of the United States Attorney for the District of New Jersey everything that Maryland had as a result of nine months of investigation. The power of a court was invoked only after the evidence had been surrendered \u2014 and then only to pray a continuance.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-5\">Judge Sodaro very properly spoke of the \u201cembarrassment\u201d and \u201chandicap\u201d to the State of Maryland \u201cbecause of the actions of the United States Attorney\u2019s Office in Camden, New Jersey____\u201d On the other hand, the Office of the State\u2019s Attorney for Baltimore City became clearly vulnerable to the charge, in appellee\u2019s brief, that it \u201cdid not want to begin Appellee\u2019s prosecution on December 19, 1977, and used the federal subpoena as an excuse not to do so.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b293-8\">The record does not disclose when the evidence came back from Camden except that it occurred some time in March 1978. We are told that the State made no effort to notify Mr. Hiken\u2019s counsel of its receipt. Patently, it made no effort to set the case for trial. The State, in its brief, argues that \u201cthe delay without a trial date being set from March 1978, when the evidence was returned, to May 2, 1978 [the date of appellee\u2019s motion to dismiss on due process grounds] again cannot be deemed anything but the orderly administration of justice [which] <em>Epps v. State, </em>[276 Md. 96, 345 A.2d 62 (1975)] labeled as neutral, not chargeable to either party.\u201d We reject this argument. Similarly, we reject the further statement in appellant\u2019s brief that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-9\">\u201cThe time period from May 2, 1978 to June 30, 1978 was taken up by the preparation, as ordered by the trial court, by the prosecution of a reply to defense counsel\u2019s May 2 motion and by the normal delay in the scheduling of a hearing on the motion. This time period is thus chargeable to Appellee.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b293-10\">The undeniable truth is that the absence of State\u2019s evidence, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>not the intervening motions, was the cause of the delay. Surely, an accused who properly asserts by motion \u201ctechnical defect defenses\u201d should not be penalized in the evaluation by the court of his claim that he was denied his right to a speedy trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">In our judgment, on the record before us, the responsibility for substantially all of the delay in this case must rest on the doorstep of the State.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-6\">\n<em>3. Assertion of the Right.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b294-7\">The transcripts of the five court proceedings before Judge Allen abundantly support his conclusion that Hiken, through counsel, clearly and forcefully asserted his right to a speedy trial \u201cat every possible turn.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b294-8\">The State argues that his assertion of the right was deficient because no <em>written </em>motion for a speedy trial was ever filed. This argument is untenable. Oral assertions of the right, on the record, are clearly sufficient. The State further contends that appellee\u2019s motions to dismiss for lack of a speedy trial do not support his claims of assertion of the right. The State\u2019s reliance, in this respect, on <em>Nocera v. State, </em>36 Md. App. 317, 374 A.2d 608 (1977) is altogether misplaced. It is true that we stated there, in language quoted in the State\u2019s brief, that a motion to dismiss is \u201cnot a motion to be tried, but a motion not to be tried ... and, therefore, does not tend to support appellant\u2019s argument that he effectively demanded a speedy trial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 321; 374 A.2d at 611. But the motion to dismiss in <em>Nocera </em>was not made until the day of trial. Here, the written motions were made in March and again in June of 1978, before any new trial date had been obtained by the State, despite the fact that the State\u2019s evidence had, at long last, been returned to Maryland from the federal authorities in New Jersey.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-9\">\n<em>4. Prejudice to the Accused.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b294-10\">In <em>Barker v. Wingo, </em>the Court identified three interests of defendants \u201cwhich the speedy trial right was designed to protect...: (1) to prevent oppressive pretrial incarceration, (2) to minimize anxiety and concern of the accused; and (3) to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>limit the possibility that the defense will be impaired. 407 U.S. at 532. As Judge Moylan carefully explained for this Court in <em>State v. Wilson, </em>whenever the delay is of \u201cconstitutional dimension,\u201d as here, prejudice will be presumed. This presumption \u201cis not conclusive but rebuttable.\u201d As Judge Moylan expressed it:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-5\">\u201cThe State, for its part, may come forward and meet its burden of producing evidence and negate the presumed prejudice.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b295-6\">35 Md. App. at 124; 371 A.2d at 149.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-7\">Although there was no pretrial incarceration here, the trial court\u2019s characterization of the prejudice to the appellee as \u201cvery substantial\u201d was amply supported. The anxiety and concern of the accused had to be extreme. All during the period of the delay, he was under a constant threat of indictment by the grand jury in New Jersey, an indictment ultimately returned but one which, as appellee argues with persuasive effect, might not have resulted if the case had proceeded to trial as scheduled in Maryland. Indeed, it was precisely the threat of a federal indictment which appellee\u2019s counsel cited, at every turn, in urging an \u201cimmediate trial\u201d in Baltimore.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-8\">Again, although not relied upon by the trial court, there was evidence of impairment of the defense. In advance of the original trial date, counsel for Hiken applied for an intrastate subpoena for Monty Artwell. In testimony before the grand jury in Baltimore, Artwell said that an individual named Levin in New Jersey had sent Artwell to Baltimore to burn the appellee\u2019s warehouse and to make the appellee the scapegoat. This testimony was recanted by Artwell after the original trial date in this case and he was indicted for perjury. The State offered no response below to appellee\u2019s proffer that his defense had been prejudiced by the loss of Artwell as a witness; and, although the circumstances are somewhat bizarre, we do not accept the State\u2019s rationalization in its brief that \u201cas of June 30,1978 the substance of Artwell\u2019s testimony was speculative at best.\u201d The crucial date was December 19, 1977, the original trial date.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>The court below properly held that the appellee was denied his right to a speedy trial and dismissed the remaining three indictments.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-5\">\n<em>Judgments affirmed; Mayor and City Council of Baltimore to pay the costs.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b280-7\">. Maryland Rule 746, effective July 1,1977, provides in subsection (a) that a trial date must be set \u201cwithin 30 days after the earlier of the appearance of counsel or the first appearance of the defendant before the court pursuant to Rule 723 (Appearance \u2014 Provision for or Waiver of Counsel), [and that] a trial date shall be set which shall be not later than 120 days after the appearance or waiver of counsel or after the appearance of defendant before the court pursuant to Rule 723.\u201d Under subsection (b) the county administrative judge or his designee may grant a change of the trial date upon motion in writing or in open court and \u201cfor extraordinary cause shown.\u201d (Appellee\u2019s counsel entered his appearance on Sept. 27, 1977.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b280-8\">. Subsequent to oral argument in this appeal, we were informed that appellee was indicted on May 23,1979 in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey, in a five-count indictment. The charges included conspiracy, wire-fraud, and racketeering, all arising out of a fire in Baltimore on December 11, 1976.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b280-9\">. The case of <em>State v. Hicks. </em>285 Md. 310, 403 A.2d 356 (1979) held that Md. Rule 746 is mandatory and not directory, overruling <em>Young v. State, </em>15 Md. App. 707, 292 A.2d 137, <em>summarily aff'd, </em>266 Md. 438, 294 A.2d 467 (1972), and that dismissal of the indictment is ordinarily the appropriate sanction for violation of the 120-day trial date requirement. The <em>Hicks </em>case could <em>not </em>be determinative of this appeal, however, because,_ as the Court of Appeals ruled \u2014 on motion for reconsideration \u2014 in a <em>per curiam </em>opinion filed on July 19, 1979, the holdings in <em>Hicks </em>\u201cwill be entirely prospective, applying only to future criminal prosecutions and only to those pending cases where, as of our mandate in this case, there have been no appearances of counsel or first appearances of defendant pursuant to Rule 723.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 338.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b281-8\">. These proceedings took place on December 16,1977, December 19,1977, January 17,1978, February 8,1978, and June 30,1978. The first proceeding was occasioned by the State\u2019s motion for a continuance of the trial date to which the defendant objected. The subsequent hearings were in connection with motions addressed to the indictments by the appellee, culminating in the second motion to dismiss for lack of a speedy trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b281-9\">.

The transcript of this proceeding discloses that the attorneys and Judge Allen conferred in chambers on June 29,1978 concerning the motions to be heard the following day and that the Assistant State\u2019s Attorney and defense counsel agreed mat a trial date would be selected after disposition of the motions, if necessary.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b289-6\">. The State\u2019s brief on this appeal points out that the Justice Department\u2019s policy on this subject at the time of the hearing in this case was contained m a memorandum of then Attorney General Edward H. Levi, dated January 18, 1977, <em>reprinted in 24 </em>Crim.L. Rptr. 3001 (Nov. 22, 1978), stating in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b289-7\"><em>\u201cProsecution in another jurisdiction </em>\u2014 The nature of the offense may be such that the federal interest in prosecution is less substantial than the interest of state or local authorities. In such cases it is entirely appropriate for the attorney for the government to consider deferring to state or local prosecution, especially if it appears that the state or local prosecution would be successful and would result in the imposition of an appropriate sentence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b289-8\">Mr. Levi emphasised that the above was not to be construed in the nature of \u201cguidelines\u201d and that \u201cthey impose no obligations on United States Attorneys, their assistants, or other attorneys for the government [nor do] they confer any rights or benefits, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law by any party to litigation with the United States.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b290-8\">.

We observe that, even where there has been full compliance with Rule 746, the <em>Barker </em>analysis may well result in a finding that the accused\u2019s speedy trial rights were denied. In the instant case, as in <em>Hicks, </em>there was compliance with subsection (a) of Rule 746. It also appears that as of the date of the proceedings in chambers before. Judge Sodaro, 3 days before trial, there was \u201cextraordinary cause\u201d for a change of the trial date.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b291-11\">. A somewhat longer period of time may arguably be involved because no new trial had been set as of June 30, 1978, when the motion to dismiss was heard, and in all likelihood no such trial date could have been set without some additional delay.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b292-7\">.
