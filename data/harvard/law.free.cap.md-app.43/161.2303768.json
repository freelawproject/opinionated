Code art. 49B, \u00a7 16 <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> (Discrimination in Employment) gives rise to a private cause of action, the appellant, William Michael Dillon (Dillon) has carried his banner to this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"AVl\">The issue put to us is \u201c[wjhether the lower court erred in sustaining Appellees\u2019 Demurrers without leave to amend?\u201d Obviously, what appellant seeks to do is to pioneer a new trail through the legal forest, thus enabling him to maintain a civil claim for monetary damages as a direct result of his not being hired by the appellees, The Great Atlantic and Pacific Tea Company, Inc. (A &amp; P) and Edward Travers, an employee of the A &amp; P. Undaunted by Dillon\u2019s cries of outrage, A &amp; P and Travers urge that we answer, <em>\u201cPioneer, Go Home.'\u201d </em><footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b182-5\">Before setting forth our discussion of the applicable law, we shall briefly state the facts as pleaded.</p>\n<p id=\"APO\">On April 24, 1975, Appellant William Michael Dillon \u201capplied for a position as a Porter with the A &amp; P ... Store then located on West Street, Annapolis, Maryland.\u201d Dillon \u201cfilled out a form and was given a card to take to the regional office of\u201d appellee. The very next day, Dillon reported to the regional office, \u201ctook a test ... completed some additional forms ... [and] was given a card indicating that he was hired as a Porter effective April 28, 1975 at a rate of $3.55 per hour.\u201d During the intervening weekend, however, Dillon was notified \u201cby an employee of the Annapolis Store <footnotemark>[3]</footnotemark> ... that he should not report to work on Monday since it had been decided by ... Edward Travers <footnotemark>[4]</footnotemark> that... [Dillon] was not to be employed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b182-7\">One week short of three years later, Dillon filed suit alleging that appellees, A &amp; P and Travers, its \u201cagent servant and or employee,\u201d violated Md. Ann. Code art. 49B, \u00a7 19<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> by refusing to employ Dillon as originally indicated. Dillon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>alleged that \u201cthe sole reason for ... [A &amp; P\u2019s] repudiation of the employment agreement was ... [Dillon\u2019s] physical disability which is unrelated in nature and extent so as to reasonably preclude the performance of the employment.\u201d <footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Dillon requested compensatory and punitive damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-4\">Appellees filed a \u201cDEMURRER AND MOTION RAISING PRELIMINARY OBJECTION\u201d on June 20, 1978. They contended that \u201cthere is no cause of action recognized at common-law in Maryland for individual relief from employment discrimination, ... [that] Art. 49B of the Annotated Code of Maryland, which forbids discrimination in employment on the basis of, <em>inter alia, </em>physical handicap, does not provide for private causes of action to remedy alleged employment discrimination\u201d. They further asserted that Dillon \u201cfailed to state any claim upon which relief can be granted,\u201d and that even if Maryland recognized \u201ca private right of action for employment discrimination,\u201d Dillon failed to exhaust his administrative remedies, and that Dillon was barred by the applicable statute of limitations from prosecuting the suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-5\">Judge Wray sustained the Demurrers without leave to amend. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-6\">At common law no claim may be successfully asserted on the ground that the claimant was discriminated against in employment because of a physical handicap or disability. Moreover, a negligent refusal to hire a person does not give rise to a right of action by the \u201cwould-be\u201d employee against the \u201cwould-not-be\u201d employer. If there is to be any redress to Dillon because of the \u201cnegligent\u201d failure to employ him, the authority therefor must be found within Md. Ann. Code art. 49B, \u00a7 16. <em>See Gutwein v. Easton Publishing Co., </em>272 Md. 563, 569, 325 A. 2d 740, 743 (1974), <em>cert. denied, </em>420 U. S. 991, 95 S. Ct. 1427, 43 L.Ed.2d 673 (1975).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b184-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>Prior to 1974, there was no legislative protection for a person claiming to be discriminated against because of a physical handicap. By Laws 1974, ch. 875, however, the General Assembly re-enacted section 19 (a) which read as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b184-4\">\u201c(a) It shall be an unlawful employment practice for an employer:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b184-5\">(1) To fail or refuse to hire or to discharge any individual, or otherwise to discriminate against any individual with respect to his compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment, because of such individual\u2019s race, color, religion, sex, age, [or] national origin, MARITAL STATUS, OR PHYSICAL OR MENTAL HANDICAP UNRELATED IN NATURE AND EXTENT SO AS TO REASONABLY PRECLUDE THE PERFORMANCE OF THE EMPLOYMENT....\u201d (Emphasis in original.)''<footnotemark>8</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>9</footnotemark>'*</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b184-6\">Such was the statutory language in effect in April 1975, when the claim underlying the instant case accrued. The administrative body charged with effectuating Article 49B is the Maryland Commission on Human Relations. Redress through administrative channels, in the words of Judge Kaplan, includes \u201can elaborate scheme for investigation, findings of facts, negotiation toward voluntary settlement and an enforcement procedure including access to the courts if a final order is not complied with or if temporary injunctive relief is deemed appropriate by the Commission....\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b184-7\">Laws 1977, ch. 937, conferred upon the Commission the power to \u201caward monetary relief,\u201d but the award is limited to a period of two (2) years, except that the time spent in appellate review is not to be counted within the two-year time frame. Md. Ann. Code art. 49B, \u00a7 11 (e). Prior to July 1,1977, the Commission was without authority to grant monetary relief to a claimant. Md. Ann. Code art. 49B, \u00a7 11 (f). That is the principal holding of <em>Gutwein. </em>The Court of Appeals <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>interpreted the employment discrimination sections of art. 49B and decided that the statute did not empower the Commission to make monetary awards for compensatory or other damages. Patently, Laws 1977, ch. 937 is the legislative reply to that holding. It is applicable, however, to those complaints filed on or after July 1, 1977. Md. Ann. Code art. 49B, \u00a7\u00a7 11 (e) and (f). Inasmuch as the change was prospective only, it does not afford any relief to appellant, whose grievance arose before the General Assembly gave birth to chapter 937.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-4\">Dillon seeks to bottom a cause of action and the concomitant right to receive a monetary award on the basis of the 1974 act. He does so on two heterogeneous hypotheses. First, he advances an \u201cimplicit theory\u201d grounded in <em>Gutwein. </em>Dillon argues that the Court of Appeals, in <em>Gutwein, </em>\u201cimplicitly recognized that the proper method of redress for monetary damages for employment discrimination was in the courts of law.\u201d We do not share appellant\u2019s reading of <em>Gutwein. </em>As we see it, Chief Judge Murphy, for the Court, was concerned in <em>Gutwein </em>with delineating the scope of relief that the Maryland Commission on Human Relations, under the former law, could grant claimants. The question of the court\u2019s role in alleviating employment discrimination was simply not before the Court. Because the issue was not then viable, the Court did not, implicitly or explicitly, pass upon the subject. Md. Rule 885. Dillon\u2019s tortuous efforts to create a tortuous cause of action from the vacuum of silence in <em>Gutwein </em>are without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-5\">The second of Dillon\u2019s hypotheses is less specious, but, nevertheless, equally short of establishing an action at law upon which to premise his case. Dillon asserts that \u201c[i]t is beyond question that the violation of a statute is evidence of negligence and if that negligence is a <em>proximate cause </em>of [ajppellant\u2019s loss ... [then] the [a]ppellees ... [are] liable for damages.\u201d Dillon\u2019s statement is not accurate,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> but even if it were, it is not applicable to the case at bar. What Dillon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>overlooks is that the statute itself, Md. Ann. Code art. 49B, sets out the only remedy for its violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-4\">We think Judge Wray correctly summarized the law with respect to the common law <em>vis-\u00e1-vis </em>the statute when he penned, \u201cIf the statute does not authorize a particular form of relief, and the common law recognizes no such cause of action, that form of relief is not available. <em>See Herd &amp; Co. vs. Krawill Machinery Corp., </em>359 U. S. 297 (1959).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b186-5\">All statutes, such as Md. Ann. Code art. 49B, which are in derogation of the common law are to be construed strictly. <em>MacBride v. Gulbro, </em>247 Md. 727, 729, 234 A. 2d 586, 588 (1967); <em>Roberts v. Warden, </em>242 Md. 459, 460, 219 A. 2d 254, 255, <em>cert. denied, </em>385 U. S. 876 (1966); <em>Gleaton v.

Ann. Code art. 49B to suggest even remotely that the construction placed upon the article should be different from that usually employed in interpreting similar statutes that are in derogation of the common law. Therefore, it is to be construed strictly.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-4\">As so construed Dillon\u2019s sole means of redress, if any, was to complain to the Human Relations Commission,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> although, as we have seen, it was then without authority to assess any pecuniary damages in favor of Dillon and against the appellees.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Whatever may be morally wrong with the appellees\u2019 alleged approach to employment of the handicapped, until such time as the legislature sanctions an action separate and apart from the proceedings before the Maryland Human Relations Commission, the courts may not countenance such claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-5\">In view of our holding, we do not address the other questions raised by appellant as to the running of the statute of limitations and the exhaustion of administrative remedies.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b187-7\">\n<em>Costs to be paid by appellant.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b182-8\">.
