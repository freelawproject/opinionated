One of the appellants, Mary Elizabeth Ginn, is admittedly not an attorney, nor is she an aggrieved party. Yet, she authored the appellants\u2019 brief and appears on the record as one of the appellants.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-11\">We shall deal first with Ms. Ginn as a party appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-12\">The Court of Appeals, in <em>Bryniarski v. Montgomery County, </em>247 Md. 137, 230 A. 2d 289 (1967), articulated a binomial test which must be met before a person may appeal, in a chartered county, from an administrative zoning board decision to the circuit court. The party appealing must have been a party before thp administrative body and must be aggrieved by the decision. <em>See also Slusher v. Hanson Road Joint Venture, </em>25 Md. App. 356, 333 A. 2d 631 (1975), <em>cert. denied, </em>275 Md. 755 (1975); <em>Largo Civic Association v. Prince George\u2019s County, </em>21 Md. App. 76, 318 A. 2d 834 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b250-13\">There is usually no difficulty in ascertaining whether a person was a party before the zoning authority inasmuch as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>the record generally reveals that fact.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Ms. Ginn appeared before the County Board of Appeals where she testified, \u201cI am not an aggrieved party. I am just here representing the neighborhood, and this property is within the neighborhood complex.\u201d Later, in response to a question by the Board's chairman, Ms. Ginn replied, \u201cI am not aggrieved, not in the sense that the Court allows aggrievement.\u201d <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Thus, the record makes unmistakable that Ms. Ginn satisfied the first prong of <em>Bryniarski, </em>appearance, but, at the same time, failed to meet the second prong, aggrievement. By her own admission she was not an aggrieved party within the meaning of the law; she possessed no right to appeal to the circuit court.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>Bryniarski v. Montgomery County, supra; Jahnigen v. Staley, </em>245 Md. 180, 135, 225 A. 2d 277, 280 (1967); <em>Alvey v. Hedin, </em>243 Md. 334, 339, 221 A. 2d 62, 64 (1966); <em>DuBay v. Crane, </em>240 Md. 180, 185, 213 A. 2d 487, 489-90 (1965); <em>Slusher v. Hanson Road Joint Venture, supra; Largo Civic Association v. Prince George\u2019s County, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b251-6\">The matter of Ms. Ginn\u2019s standing in the circuit court appears from the record to have been raised but not decided. In the trial court Ms. Ginn felt that she had standing, largely, we infer, because she was the designated spokesperson for the other appellants whose standing was not disputed. Moreover, Ms. Ginn was of the view that Md. Ann. Code art. 10, \u00a7 1 permitted her to represent the other appellants because she was not \u201cperforming the functions of an attorney for pay or reward either directly or indirectly.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b252-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>Although Judge DeWaters did not address the issue of Ms. Ginn\u2019s standing, we have no hesitancy in holding that Ms. Ginn was not an \u201caggrieved party\u201d within the meaning of Maryland law: she was not properly before the circuit court; and she should not have been heard. It follows from what we have said that the appeal, with respect to Ms. Ginn, should have been dismissed by the circuit court. We now <em>sua sponte </em>dismiss it on the basis of lack of standing on the part of Ms. Ginn to maintain the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-5\">Prior to oral argument, the Clerk of this Court, at the Court\u2019s direction, notified Ms. Ginn that it would not allow her to appear and argue on behalf of the other appellants. While she disagreed with the Court\u2019s position, she, nevertheless, did not argue the case. One of the other appellants, John H. Engel, argued <em>pro se.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b252-6\">The difficulty facing us is that the other appellants are aggrieved parties and did properly note an appeal, but the brief filed on their behalf is not by counsel or by any of them <em>pro se. </em>Rather, it has been filed by Ms. Ginn as \u201cAppellant and Spokesman for the Appellants.\u201d As we see it, Ms. Ginn\u2019s protestations to the contrary, what she did in this case constitutes the practice of law in violation of Md. Annotated Code art. 10.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b252-7\">This Court, in <em>Lukas v. Bar Association of Montgomery County, </em>35 Md. App. 442, 371 A. 2d 669, <em>cert. denied, </em>280 Md. 733 (1977), referred to <em>Public Service Commission v. Hahn Transportation, Inc., </em>253 Md. 571, 253 A. 2d 845 (1969) and said \u201cwhat constitutes the practice of law is for the courts to determine.\u201d 35 Md. App. at 447. We further stated, \u201cThe power to regulate and define what constitutes the practice of law is vested solely in the judicial branch of government and not the executive nor the legislative.\u201d 35 Md. App. at 447. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>It is hard to conceive that one would prepare the necessary appeal notice from the County Board, prepare a ten (10) page memorandum of law, complete with statutory and case citations, argue the case before the circuit court, note an appeal to this Court, prepare the necessary brief and record extract, complete with citations to prior decisions, and at the same time assert that they are not practicing law. Obviously, Ms. Ginn is of the erroneous belief that because she has not and will not receive \u201cpay or reward either directly or indirectly\u201d she is outside the ambit of the prohibition against lay persons practicing law. If the lack of payment or reward is the determining factor, then she could, based on her reasoning, perform brain surgery without compensation and successfully contend that she was not practicing medicine. As we see it, Ms. Ginn has transgressed the line between spokesperson and advocate, confidant and counsel, aider and attorney. Her appeal is dismissed.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b253-5\">We shall treat all other appellants, except Mr. Engel, as having submitted on the brief. Engel, as we have said, appeared and argued the case in his own behalf.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-6\">The record discloses that following the appellees\u2019<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> purchase of a property located at the northwest corner of Alleghany and Central Avenues in Towson, Baltimore County, Maryland, the County Council reclassified the area to that of a higher density, namely, DR. 16. An office use is permitted in such a zone by Special Exception. The appellees petitioned the Zoning Commissioner for Baltimore County for a \u201cSpecial Exception and Area Variance\u201d to permit office use. The area variance was requested because the structure located on the property violated the existing front and side yard setback requirements. The Zoning Commissioner granted the petition, subject to certain conditions. An appeal was taken to the County Board of Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-7\">At that hearing, a registered professional engineer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>testified that in his opinion the requested use would not be detrimental to the health, safety, or general welfare of the locality involved. The engineer foresaw no difficulty with traffic congestion nor overcrowding. Indeed, he believed that the granting of the sought-after use would lessen the burden that then existed. He founded his opinion on the fact that the property would be changed from three apartments to an offic\u00e9 with one apartment. The witness did not perceive any violation of the letter or spirit of Baltimore County Zoning Regulations \u00a7 307.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b254-5\">An architect testified that in his opinion the office use would not offend the public safety, health, and general welfare, nor would it cause traffic congestion or create fire hazards. Similar testimony was produced by other witnesses called in behalf of the appellees.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-6\">The gist of the appellants\u2019 testimony was that they did not want to see any variance or exception granted. They felt that if the exception were to be granted it would be the beginning of a change in the whole block, and that traffic congestion would develop. The Board granted the appellees\u2019 petition subject to five (5) restrictions.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The circuit court affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>In this Court the appellants argue:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b255-5\">\u201cI. The Board ... rendered its opinion without the legally required showing of proof of practical difficulty or unreasonable hardship by the Appellees.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b255-6\">II. The Board ... rendered its opinion without regard to the spirit and intent of the zoning regulations for Baltimore County.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b255-7\">III. The Board ... committed major procedural error by permitting the appellees to introduce new evidence after the appellees had closed their case and after the appellants had closed their case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b255-8\">IV. The Circuit Court committed error in holding that the evidence presented before the Board... was sufficient for them [the members of the Board] to rule in favor of a special exception.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b255-9\">We read the appellants first and second issues to be but one and that is that the evidence before the Board was insufficient to sustain its findings. There is no need to enter into a prolonged discourse in which we summarize the evidence. The testimony of the professional engineer was sufficient for the Board to rule as it did. All that is required by courts in reviewing a Board\u2019s determination is that the Board\u2019s decision be based on fairly debatable evidence. <em>Gowl v. Atlantic Richfield Co., </em>27 Md. App. 410, 341 A. 2d 832 (1975). The testimony of the engineer, by itself, was sufficient to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>trigger the \u201cfairly debatable\u201d standard. It is not the function of the courts to retry or second guess the Board. When there is fairly debatable evidence the courts must refrain from substituting their judgment for that of the Board. <em>Commissioner, Baltimore City Police Department v. Cason, </em>34 Md. App. 487, 368 A. 2d 1067 (1977); <em>Gowl v. Atlantic Richfield Co., supra; Von Lusch v. Board of County Commissioners of Queen Anne\u2019s County, </em>24 Md. App. 383, 330 A. 2d 738 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b256-5\">We agree with Judge DeWaters that the evidence was sufficient to entitle the Board to grant a variance and exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-6\">After the parties had seemingly closed their presentations of evidence, Mr. Coady was recalled by the appellees for \u201credirect examination.\u201d An objection to his testimony was sustained. Nevertheless, he continued to answer without further objection the questions put to him by his counsel and was cross-examined by Ms. Ginn. The latter was recalled by-the protestants and her testimony was received. Appellants complain that the Board erred in receiving evidence from Coady after the testimony had been closed.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-7\">A zoning board, along with other administrative agencies, is generally not bound by the technical rules of evidence although it must observe fundamental fairness in dealing with the parties who appear before it. <em>Fairchild Hiller Corp. v. Supervisor of Assessments, </em>267 Md. 519, 298 A. 2d 148 (1973); <em>Dal Maso v. Board of County Commissioners of Prince George\u2019s County, </em>238 Md. 333, 209 A. 2d 62 (1964); Md. Annotated Code art. 41, \u00a7 252. The appellants, in the instant case, objected to two of the questions asked Mr. Coady. They did so on the basis of the evidence\u2019s having been closed. Both times they objected their objections were sustained. What appellants did not do was to continue to object to the subsequent questions. Thus, the answers to those questions were admitted into evidence and, inferentially, considered by the Board. The initiative in excluding answers to improper questions rests upon the shoulders of the opposing party. If the opponent fails to object, he will not later be heard to-complain that the evidence should not have been admitted. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number><em>Baltimore &amp; Ohio R.R. v. Black, </em>107 Md. 642, 658, 69 A. 439 (1908); 1 <em>Wigmore on Evidence </em>\u00a7 18 (3d ed. 1940). The failure to object to the questions as propounded constitutes a waiver. <em>State Roads Commission v. Bare, </em>220 Md. 91, 151 A. 2d 154 (1959). <em>See also Sutton v. State, 25 </em>Md. App. 309, 334 A. 2d 126 (1975). Inasmuch as there were no objections to the questions that the appellants now find objectionable, the objections were waived and the Board did not err in considering the answers to those questions. The Board, in an apparent attempt to be fair, allowed the appellants to reopen appellants\u2019 case and offer additional testimony. Even if the matter of waiver were not present, we would, under the circumstances, be hard pressed to hold that the Board denied appellants fundamental fairness.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-5\">We have said the Board had before it sufficient evidence to support its findings. It follows then that the circuit court did not err in affirming the Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-6\">\n<em>Appeal as to Mary Elizabeth Ginn dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b257-7\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b257-8\">\n<em>Costs to be paid by appellants.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b250-16\">.
