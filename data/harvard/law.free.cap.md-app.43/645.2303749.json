Sometimes, however, the short answer results in unnecessary complications. This appeal involves an apparent pragmatic conclusion reached by a trial judge in the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County which, while seemingly practical, is incorrect.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We shall, for the reasons hereinafter stated, reverse and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-10\">\n<em>THE FACTS</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b666-11\">The record before us discloses that the appellant, Ricky B., then 15 years of age, was charged in a series of juvenile petitions,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and that he was also charged under an eighteen <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>(18) count indictment<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> for offenses not within the exclusive jurisdiction of the juvenile court. <em>See </em>Md. Courts and Judicial Proceedings Code Ann. \u00a7 3-804 (d).</p>\n<p id=\"b667-5\">It developed that the appellant sought what has been stylistically known as a \u201creverse waiver.\u201d He asked the circuit court to waive exclusive criminal jurisdiction over him and to refer the rape and related charges to the juvenile court. Md. Ann. Code art. 27, \u00a7 594A; <em>Kennedy v. State, </em>21 Md. App. 234, 319 A.2d 850 (1974). At the same time the State, pursuant to Courts Art. \u00a7 3-817, requested the juvenile court to waive jurisdiction over appellant so that the State could subject Ricky B. to the full panoply of the criminal law. The \u201creverse waiver\u201d and the \u201cwaiver\u201d petitions were set for hearing before the same judge on the same day. As it happened the \u201creyerse waiver\u201d was the first matter considered. The hearing judge concluded that the appellant was \u201cwell beyond the amenability of the Juvenile Court to treat, or rehabilitate\u201d appellant. He declined to waive jurisdiction to the juvenile court. No immediate appeal has been nor may be taken from that decision. <em>In re Appeal No. 507, </em>34 Md. App. 440, 367 A.2d 553 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b667-6\">The hearing judge then turned his attention to the State\u2019s request for waiver from the juvenile court to the circuit court. The judge said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b667-7\">\u201cCall the juvenile numbers, and I will do that summarily, ... which I think the law provides for.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b667-8\">Having just ruled in the criminal matter ... that he [appellant] would not be waived back [s/c] to Juvenile Court, I now find in the juvenile matter, summarily, that he should be waived up to the adult <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>court, and I will sign such a waiver order in each case.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b668-5\">\n<em>THE LAW</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b668-6\">By Md. Ann. Code art. 27, \u00a7 594A (b) the Legislature has mandated that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b668-7\">\u201cIn making a determination as to waiver of [criminal] jurisdiction the [hearing] court shall consider the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b668-8\">(1) Age of child;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b668-9\">(2) Mental and physical condition of child;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b668-10\">(3) The child\u2019s amenability to treatment in any institution, facility, or program available to delinquents;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b668-12\">(4) The nature of the alleged offense; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b668-13\">(5) The public safety.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b668-14\">When a \u201creverse waiver\u201d hearing is held, the burden of demonstrating that the waiver should be exercised is carried by the party initiating it, <em>i.e., </em>the juvenile. <em>Kennedy v. State, supra </em>at 240.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-15\">The five factors of Article 27, \u00a7 594A (b) are also found, <em>mot \u00e1 mot, </em>in Courts Art. \u00a7 3-817 (d). The only variance appearing in section 3-817 (d) from that of Art. 27, \u00a7 594A (b) is the legislative <em>fia tin </em>the former that the hearing court must consider the following <em>\u201ccriteria individually and in relation to each other on the record.\u201d </em><footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>In re Johnson, </em>17 Md. App. 705, 712, 304 A.2d 859, 863 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b668-16\">There is no real difference between Courts Art. \u00a7 3-817(d) and Article 27, \u00a7 594A (b) insofar as the legislative direction as to how the factors are to be weighed is concerned. We made clear in <em>Kennedy v. State, supra, </em>that the weighing of the factors, whether they appear in the Courts Art. \u00a7 3-817(d) or Article 27, \u00a7 594A (b), is \u201csimilar.\u201d 21 Md. App. at 240. Yet, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>there is a difference in the manner in which the two statutes are applied. When a juvenile stands accused of one of those offenses expressly excluded from juvenile court jurisdiction, he or she carries the burden of establishing, under the five factors of Art. 27, \u00a7 594A (b), that the adult or criminal court should waive jurisdiction to the juvenile court. He or she must demonstrate to the hearing judge that the \u201creverse waiver\u201d is \u201cin the interest of the child or society.\u201d Md. Ann. Code art. 27, \u00a7 594A (a). <em>King v. State, </em>36 Md. App. 124, 128, 373 A.2d 292, 295, <em>cert. denied, </em>281 Md. 740 (1977). On the other hand, when it is the State that seeks a waiver of jurisdiction from the juvenile court to the adult or criminal court, the State shoulders the onus of showing by a preponderance of the evidence that a weighing of five factors tilts in favor of waiver and, patently, against the juvenile. <em>In re Trader, </em>20 Md. App. 1, 315 A.2d 528, <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds, </em>272 Md. 364, 325 A.2d 398 (1974); <em>In re Barker, </em>17 Md. App. 714, 305 A.2d 211 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b669-5\">It is possible that when a hearing is held on \u201creverse waiver\u201d that the juvenile will fail to meet his burden. It is equally possible that when the hearing is held on the juvenile waiver that the State\u2019s proof will fail to pass muster, thus, leaving everyone where it finds them.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-6\">Courts Art. \u00a7 3-817 (g) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b669-7\">\u201cIf the [juvenile] court has once waived its jurisdiction with respect to a child ... and that child is subsequently brought before the [juvenile] court on another charge of delinquency, the [juvenile] court may waive its jurisdiction in the subsequent proceeding after summary review.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b669-8\">The exception to a full-blown waiver hearing can, under the statute, only occur when there has been a prior waiver by the <em>juvenile court. </em>The statute does not permit the \u201csummary review\u201d when, as here, there has been a \u201creverse waiver\u201d hearing by the adult or criminal court. The statute operates in one direction only; it does not allow the procedural short cut employed by the judge in the instant case. When the General Assembly has meticulously set forth a procedure to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number>be followed by courts in considering the waiver of juvenile jurisdiction, the courts may not, in the guise of pragmatism, judicially amend the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-5\">What the hearing judge did in the instant case was to waive <em>summarily </em>juvenile jurisdiction over four otherwise exclusively juvenile offenses, because the juvenile fell short of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that the immediately previously heard \u201creverse waiver,\u201d regarding the eighteen count indictment, was in the interest of the juvenile or society. By so doing the court seemingly erroneously shifted the State\u2019s waiver hearing burden to the back of the juvenile and eliminated entirely the State\u2019s obligation to demonstrate that jurisdiction should have been waived. Just as \u201ca small leak ... [may] sink a great ship\u201d <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> so, too, may a procedural error overturn a trial court\u2019s ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-6\">We paraphrase what we said in the beginning by noting that some short cuts turn out to be the longest way. The case must be reversed and remanded in order that there can be a valid waiver hearing within the meaning of Courts Art. \u00a7 3-817 (d).</p>\n<p id=\"b670-7\">\n<em>Order waiving juvenile jurisdiction reversed and case remanded for further proceedings.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b670-8\">\n<em>Costs are not reallocated as part of the judgment of this Court pursuant to Maryland Rule 1082F.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b666-12\">. \u201cThe great weakness of Pragmatism is that it ends by being of no <em>use </em>to anybody/\u2019 Thomas Stearns Eliot, 1888-1965, <em>Francis Herbert Bradley.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b666-13\">. The four juvenile petitions charged appellant with:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b666-14\">(1) Stealing and disassembling a bicycle in Cheverly, Maryland, on June 4, 1978.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b666-16\">(2) Breaking and entering a dwelling on Flagstaff Avenue in Prince George\u2019s County, on June 9, 1978.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b666-18\">(3) Breaking and entering a residence in Chapel Oaks, Maryland and stealing property worth more than $100.00, on June 27, 1978.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b667-9\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>(4) Breaking and entering the Fiesta Amusement Arcade office in Fairmont Heights, Maryland, on August 23, 1978.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b667-11\">. The indictment charged the appellant with three (3) counts of first degree rape; two (2) counts of second degree rape; three (3) counts of attempted first degree rape; two (2) counts of attempted second degree rape; two (2) counts of assault with intent to rape; two (2) counts of assault and battery; two (2) counts of housebreaking; burglary; and destruction of private property.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b668-17\">. The quoted and italicized language was added to section 3-817(d) by 1977 Md. Laws, ch. 490. The language is obviously taken from In re Johnson, <em>supra. </em>By enacting ch. 490, tne General Assembly turned case law into statutory law.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b670-9\">.
