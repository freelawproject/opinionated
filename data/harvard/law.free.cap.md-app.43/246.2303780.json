Code Ann., Art. 27, \u00a7 23) and one count of extortion (Art. 27, \u00a7 562). His four day trial on these charges took place in December 1977, in the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County before Judge E. Mackall Childs, presiding without a jury. After the completion of the trial on December 22, 1977, the judge took the case under advisement and on January 9, 1978, read and filed in open court a written 27% page \u201cMemorandum of Opinion\u201d that reviewed in detail the voluminous evidence and set forth the verdicts and reasons therefor. Appellant was sentenced on February 27, 1978.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-12\">In this appeal, the appellant does not contest the sufficiency of the evidence either as to his criminal agency or the corpus delicti of the crimes for which he was convicted. He presents five questions for our consideration.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b267-13\">\u201c1. Did the trial judge deny Appellant due process of law in failing to disqualify himself?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b268-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>2. Did the trial court err in failing to dismiss the indictment as violative of a prior plea bargaining agreement?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b268-5\">3. Did the trial judge err in admitting testimony under the co-conspirator\u2019s exception?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b268-6\">4. Did the trial judge err in refusing to strike unsupported opinion testimony?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b268-7\">5. Did the trial court err in convicting Appellant of bribery and extortion for the same act?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b268-8\">Our answer to each of the questions is \u201cNo.\u201d The judgments of conviction will therefore be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-9\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b268-10\">\n<em>Due Process</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b268-11\">Appellant argues that because Judge Childs did not accede to his request to disqualify himself, he was denied due process. He argues that prior to the trial on the merits the judge \u201cexhibited prejudice toward both appellant and his counsel\u201d and that the judge harbored \u201ca preconceived determination of Appellant\u2019s guilt\u201d that deprived him \u201cof a fair opportunity to present the issues and denied him the fair tribunal required by Due Process.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b268-12\">We note at the outset that with respect to the trial itself the appellant refers us to no comment, no ruling or any other evidence that would reflect the judge\u2019s alleged predetermination of appellant\u2019s guilt or that appellant was \u201cdenied a fair opportunity to present the issues.\u201d We also note that appellant was afforded the opportunity to remove the case to another jurisdiction for trial and that although he had initially prayed a jury trial he subsequently \u2014 <em>after </em>the judge refused to disqualify himself \u2014 elected a court trial and did not take advantage of the judge\u2019s offer to remove the case. We are not told by appellant why, if he was so concerned about the judge\u2019s alleged bias, he did not elect one or both of these alternatives that were available to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-13\">Where a defendant in a criminal case alleges prejudice or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>bias as a ground for the judge to recuse himself, it is the defendant\u2019s burden to show that the judge by his words or actions has demonstrated a hostile feeling or spirit of ill will against him or his counsel of such a character as might prevent the judge from giving him a fair trial. See 46 Am. Jur. 2d, <em>Judges, </em>\u00a7 220 (1969). The burden borne by the defendant in this regard is a substantial one. This is so because of the \u201cassumed proposition that judges are men of discernment, learned and experienced in the law and capable of evaluating the materiality of evidence.\u201d <em>State v. Babb, </em>258 Md. 547, 550, 267 A.2d 190 (1970). See, also, <em>State v. Hutchinson, </em>260 Md. 227, 271 A.2d 641 (1970). The appellant has failed to meet that burden in the case before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-5\">In ruling on the motion to disqualify himself, Judge Childs said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b269-6\">\u201cThis court has no disposition whatsoever as to Mr. Carey. I\u2019ve never seen him before and couldn\u2019t care less to whether he prevails or fails to do so in this particular case.... I take a completely dispassionate view of the outcome of Mr. Carey\u2019s problems.... I think the testimony will stand on its own feet one way or the other; and frankly again I would reiterate that whether Mr. Carey is found guilty or innocent is no concern of mine. <em>I expect to call it as I see it; </em>and as of this point I see no reason whatsoever for disqualification.\u201d (Emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b269-7\">Our review of the record, including Judge Childs\u2019s detailed memorandum opinion at the close of the case, convinces us that the judge did exactly what he said he would do, <em>i.e., </em>\u201ccall it as I see it.\u201d We are not persuaded that he did otherwise, as alleged by the appellant, merely because he had found the appellant\u2019s co-defendant guilty in a prior non-jury trial. Participation in prior legal proceedings involving related parties or issues is simply not grounds for a judge to recuse himself. <em>United States v. Partin, </em>552 F.2d 621 (5th Cir. 1977); <em>Laws and Dorman v. State, </em>7 Md. App. 84, 253 A.2d 780 (1969). Nor are we persuaded otherwise by the fact that the judge acceded to the State\u2019s suggestion to grant a defendant in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>another case a new trial and accept a plea of <em>nolo contendere </em>whereby that defendant received a suspended sentence for obstruction of justice (rather than perjury) so he would be available to testify for the State in the on-going investigation of the public school construction program. Appellant argues that this action by the judge \u201cactively assisted the State in its prosecution of him\u201d.(We note, however,, that the would-be witness did not testify at appellant\u2019s trial on the merits. We also note that the action of the. judge in granting the defendant a new trial in the other case took place on June 1, 1977, weeks after the appellant\u2019s originally scheduled trial date and after the State had made numerous attempts to bring the case to trial for which it was presumably fully prepared before June 1, 1977. It seems highly unlikely, therefore, that the judge\u2019s action did in fact assist the State in its case against the appellant. Moreover, even assuming the judge thought that his action would be helpful in ferreting out the truth, this is not to be equated with disqualifying bias or prejudice likely to prevent a fair trial. <em>See, United States v. Liddy, </em>166 U.S. App. D. C. 95, 509 F.2d 428 (1974), <em>cert. denied, </em>420 U.S. 911 (1975); <em>United States v. McCord, </em>166 U.S. App. D. C. 1, 509 F.2d 334 (1974), <em>cert. denied, </em>421 U.S. 930 (1975); <em>United States v. Haldeman, </em>559 F.2d 31 (D.C. Cir. 1976); <em>compare, In Re Murchison, </em>349 U.S. 133, 75 S. Ct. 623, 99 L. Ed. 942 (1955).</p>\n<p id=\"b270-5\">Appellant argues further that the trial judge\u2019s determination \u201cto hold his ruling on appellant\u2019s pretrial motion to dismiss <em>sub curia </em>in order to thwart any interlocutory appeal and move the case immediately to trial\u201d is another indication of the judge\u2019s bias or prejudice. We see no merit whatsoever to this argument. As a belated additional ground for the motion to dismiss the charges against him, appellant claimed that his trial was barred on double jeopardy grounds. When the judge decided to hold the matter <em>sub curia </em>until after trial on the merits, appellant appealed to this Court. It is true, of course, that denial of a motion to dismiss on double jeopardy grounds is immediately appealable, <em>Neal v. State, </em>272 Md. 323, 322 A.2d 887 (1974), and that failure to rule on a motion bottomed on those grounds before trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>constitutes error, <em>Claybrooks v. State, </em>36 Md. App. 295, 374 A.2d 365 (1977). As it turned out in this case, however, trial on the merits did not take place until after the double jeopardy claim had been rejected by this Court. <em>See Carey v. State, </em>37 Md. App. 689, 379 A.2d 178 (1977), <em>cert. denied </em>December 5, 1977. In any event, Judge Childs\u2019s initial determination to hold the matter <em>sub curia </em>until after trial, does not, in our opinion, form the basis for his disqualification. \u201c... [N]o deduction of bias and prejudice may be made from adverse rulings by a judge, whether they are right or wrong.\u201d 46 Am. Jur. 2d, <em>Judges, </em>\u00a7 221 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b271-5\">Finally, on the issue of disqualification, appellant argues that Judge Childs \u201cexhibited hostility toward appellant\u2019s counsel during the course of the proceedings\u201d. Here, we are referred only to the fact that nearly four months before the trial of this case the judge had recused himself in an unrelated civil matter in which appellant\u2019s counsel represented one of the parties. The judge explained on the record his reasons for the recusement. While we agree that the record of pre-trial proceedings in this case does reflect a certain amount of mutual antipathy between the judge and defense counsel, we cannot say that so far as the judge was concerned there has been any showing of that degree of personal bias or prejudice toward defense counsel that would indicate the likelihood that the appellant would not receive a fair and impartial trial. \u201cA judge may, with or without cause, cordially dislike and even distrust an attorney and yet be capable of doing exact justice towards his client.\u201d <em>Shakin v. Board of Medical Examiners, </em>254 Cal. App. 2d 102, 62 Cal. Rptr. 274, 287, 23 A.L.R. 3d 1398, 1415 (1967), <em>app. dism\u2019dand cert. denied, </em>390 U.S. 410 (1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b271-6\">In sum, we conclude that none of the arguments advanced by the appellant, either alone or in combination, form the basis for holding that Judge Childs\u2019s failure to disqualify himself denied the appellant due process of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b271-8\">\n<em>The Prior Plea Bargaining Agreement</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b271-9\">The appellant was indicted in the present case on August <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>30,1976. On November 15,1976, he filed a motion to dismiss the indictment alleging the violation of a plea bargaining agreement in a prior case in which he had pled guilty to forgery and false pretenses. The charges in the prior case arose out of appellant\u2019s activities as Executive Director of the Interagency Committee on School Construction. They were unrelated to the charges in the present case. See <em>Carey v. State, </em>37 Md. App. at 694. The appellant allegedly prepared and approved a false invoice in the amount of $22,105.19 dated <em>November 1, 1978 </em>for work that had not been performed by a sub-contractor. Through various machinations he received the proceeds and used them to pay his personal debts. On <em>January 9, 1976, </em>after protracted negotiations, he entered a guilty plea to the prior charges pursuant to a plea bargaining agreement. The following language of the written agreement referring to the possibility of future prosecutions was ultimately agreed upon:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b272-5\">\u201cIn closing, it is appropriate to place upon the record the precise limits of the State of Maryland\u2019s agreement not to seek further indictments against Defendant Carey. <em>This agreement extends only to the specific matters discussed in this exposition and to any other crimes based upon evidence already in the possession of and fully developed by the State of Maryland as of this date. </em>To the extent then that such additional criminal acts of Defendant Carey might be developed in the continuation of this investigation the State has given no assurances to him and expressly reserves the right to seek indictments and to prosecute for such acts.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b272-6\">Appellant contends that the State\u2019s action in bringing the bribery and extortion charges after having entered into the plea bargain was a breach of the agreement and that the trial court erred in not granting his motion to dismiss the present indictment because of that breach. As we understand appellant\u2019s argument, it is that because the State was investigating bribery and extortion charges in connection <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>with the school construction program at the time of the plea bargain, the State is barred by the agreement from bringing the present indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-5\">As we see it, the only issues presented by the agreement are: 1) Does the present indictment cover \u201cspecific matters\u201d set forth in the \u201cexposition\u201d at the prior trial?, and 2) Is the present indictment based upon evidence that was in the State\u2019s possession and \u201cfully developed\u201d on January 9,1976, the date of the guilty plea? The appellant does not argue the first issue. He argues, however, that the second issue should be answered in the affirmative. The answer depends upon the factual evidence. Both Judge Evans and Judge Childs, after extended hearings, determined the answer adversely to the appellant. Our review of the record leaves us unconvinced that these rulings were erroneous, much less <em>clearly </em>erroneous. We shall therefore not disturb them. Maryland Rule 1086.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b273-7\">\n<em>The Co-Conspirator Exception</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b273-8\">At trial one of the State\u2019s principal witnesses was George W. Hargest who testified, over appellant\u2019s objection, as to what another person (John O. Bishop) had told Hargest concerning the bribery scheme involving the appellant. This testimony was admitted on the basis of the \u201cco-conspirator exception to the hearsay rule\u201d. On appeal, appellant does not contest the validity of the general rule that statements made by one co-conspirator (Bishop) in furtherance of the conspiracy are admissible against another co-conspirator (the appellant). Nor does the appellant argue that there was no conspiracy shown. Nor does he question the applicability of the hearsay exception even though, as in this case, the defendant was not formally charged with conspiracy. What is argued here is that there is an exception to the general rule under which Hargest\u2019s hearsay testimony would otherwise be admissible. The appellant asserts on appeal that because the statute of limitations had run on the crime of conspiracy the hearsay testimony was inadmissible. Citing <em>United States </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number><em>v. Klosterman, </em>248 F.2d 191, 195 (3rd Cir. 1957) for the proposition that \u201cevidence of conspiracy may not be introduced against a defendant who has been acquitted of the conspiracy charge\u201d, appellant asserts that because of the statute of limitations he \u201cis in the same position as if he had been tried and acquitted of conspiracy\u201d and therefore the hearsay testimony offered by Hargest should have been excluded.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-5\">The difficulty with this contention is that it was not made at the trial below. Although appellant did object to the hearsay testimony of Hargest, his counsel\u2019s stated ground for the objection was simply \u201cinadequate foundation\u201d. Despite the trial judge\u2019s specific reference to the co-conspirator exception as the reason for admitting the testimony and the State\u2019s specific reference to the statute of limitations, appellant never once suggested to the trial judge that the general rule was inapplicable because of the passage of time. The trial judge, therefore, had no opportunity to rule on the issue now being raised in this appeal. Under the circumstances, the issue is not properly before us for review and is deemed to have been waived as a ground for the objection. See Md. Rules 761, 522 d, and 1085. <em>See, also, von Lusch v. State, </em>279 Md. 255, 263, 368 A.2d 468 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b274-6\">rv</p>\n<p id=\"b274-7\">\n<em>Denial of Motion to Strike Accountant\u2019s Testimony</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b274-8\">Irving Machiz, a Certified Public Accountant, whose qualifications were not questioned by the appellant, testified that for the period in question he analyzed all of appellant\u2019s known sources of income, correlated the income to his bank deposit records, and determined that there were approximately $16,500 in \u201cunexplained currency deposits by Mr. Carey\u201d. From documentary evidence before the court, he determined that these \u201cunexplained deposits\u201d corresponded both in time and approximate amount to the sums Hargest said he paid the appellant in furtherance of the bribery scheme. In cross examination, appellant\u2019s counsel challenged the accuracy of the $16,500 figure by attempting to show, in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>a general way, that the $16,500 could have represented sums deposited by the appellant that he received from legitimate sources of which Machiz was unaware. Machiz admitted this possibility, but said he had labelled the $16,500 as \u201cunexplained currency deposits\u201d only after considering all evidence that was available to him \u2014 \u201cprimarily\u201d the documentary exhibits that were already in the case. He conceded that his analysis was based \u201cin part\u201d upon evidence that was not before the court. He explained, however, that he used this other evidence in an attempt to identify or explain the source of all bank deposits made by appellant during the period in question. For example, he said he had \u201cread transcripts of interviews of Mr. Carey by the State\u2019s Attorney and the State Police in this connection\u201d and \u201calso used information that Mr. Carey submitted when he applied for a loan in connection with the background, the possibility of having cash, so we could give him credit if we found evidence of it\u201d. He had earlier testified that, \u201cAll loans were credited.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b275-5\">At the conclusion of the State\u2019s case, appellant moved to strike all of Machiz\u2019s testimony on the ground, reiterated on appeal, that his \u201copinion\u201d was \u201cbased upon documents and testimony that is not in evidence\u201d. Judge Childs denied the motion, saying \u201cas far as I\u2019m concerned he was basing his conclusion on documentary evidence that he had.\u201d We find no error in that ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-6\">Actually, Machiz was not called upon to state and did not state an opinion that the $16,500 was bribe money. To the contrary, he testified that based on an accounting analysis of a variety of exhibits in evidence he was unable to explain the source of the $16,500 that appellant had deposited in his bank accounts during the period in question. He further testified, again from exhibits in evidence, that these sums ($16,500) appeared in appellant\u2019s bank accounts during the same period of time that Hargest had previously testified he had been paying bribes to the appellant in comparable amounts.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-7\">As we see it, the only effect of appellant\u2019s cross examination of Machiz was to raise the mere possibility that the $16,500, otherwise unexplained by the exhibits in evidence (and otherwise unexplained by any evidence offered by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>appellant), <em>could </em>have had a known non-culpable source. This is purely a matter of the weight of the evidence and, in our judgment, is not a basis for excluding Machiz\u2019s testimony in its entirety. This is not a case calling for the invocation of the general rule that an expert\u2019s <em>opinion </em>should not be admitted unless predicated upon facts in evidence or proffered to be proved. Compare <em>Noble v. Director, </em>32 Md. App. 192, 359 A.2d 253 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b276-6\">\n<em>Bribery and Extortion Convictions</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b276-7\">Count Five of the indictment charged that on or about January 16, 1973, the appellant, in violation of Maryland Code, Article 27, Section 23, \u201cdid unlawfully and corruptly <em>demand a bribe, </em>fee, reward and testimonial, to wit: Seven Thousand Five Hundred Dollars ($7,500.00), the precise amount being unknown to the Grand Jurors, but said amount representing all or part of certain \u2018sales commission\u2019 checks to be drawn by Globe Industries, Inc.,... payable to George W. Hargest, <em>for the purpose of influencing [the appellant] in the performance of his official </em>duties..(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b276-8\">Count Thirteen of the indictment charged that appellant, in violation of Maryland Code, Article 27, Section 562,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> on or about January 16, 1973, \u201cfeloniously and corruptly did <em>threaten </em>Vernon Morton, in his capacity as Vice President and agent of Globe Industries, Inc. <em>... to foreclose, prevent, and bar any contracts by the said Globe Industries, Inc., </em>with the Public School Construction Program of the State of Maryland, thereby threatening to do injury to the property of said Globe Industries, Inc., <em>with the view... to extort and gain from the said Globe Industries, Inc., certain money, to wit:... </em>$7,500.00....\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b276-9\">The trial court found appellant guilty of both counts. On <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>appeal, appellant contends that his convictions of both counts \u201ccannot stand\u201d because \u201cthe<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> offenses of Bribery and Extortion are mutually exclusive\u201d and because \u201cthe finding of voluntary payment implicit in the conviction of Bribery is inconsistent with the finding of duress inherent in the conviction of extortion\u201d. Although this issue was not raised or decided below we shall, nevertheless, consider it here as it does not appear that precisely the same sentence was imposed for each of the two counts involved.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> See <em>Slye v. State, </em>42 Md. App. 520, 401 A.2d 195 (1979); <em>Brooks v. State, </em>38 Md. App. 550, 552, 381 A.2d 718 (1978); <em>aff'd. </em>284 Md. 416, 397 A.2d 596 (1979); <em>Rose v. State, </em>37 Md. App. 388, 377 A.2d 588, <em>cert. denied, </em>281 Md. 743 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b277-6\">We do not agree that the crimes charged in Count Five and Count Thirteen are \u201cmutually exclusive\u201d or, as implied by appellant, that convictions of both counts result in inconsistent judgments. The \u201cbribery\u201d charged in Count Five consisted of the \u201cdemand by a public official for money for the purpose of influencing [that official] in the performance of his official duties\u201d. This conduct is proscribed by Article 27, Section 23 of the Maryland Code. The \u201cextortion\u201d charged in Count Thirteen consisted of the <em>threat </em>\u201cto do injury to the property of ... Globe Industries, Inc.\u201d, unless money was paid to the appellant. This conduct is proscribed by Article 27, Section 592.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-7\">As stated in <em>Newton v. State, </em>280 Md. 260, 267, 373 A.2d 262 (1977), quoting from <em>Gavieres v. United States, </em>220 U.S. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>338, 31 S. Ct. 421 (1911), \u201c '[a] single transaction may be an offense against two statutes if each statute requires proof of a fact which the other does not\u2019 Here, each offense has at least one distinct element not present in the other. Count Five requires proof that the criminal actor be an officer or employee of the State or of a political subdivision; Count Thirteen has no such requirement. Count Thirteen requires proof of a threat; Count Five does not. Count Thirteen requires proof that the threat be for the purpose of obtaining \u201cmoney, goods or chattels or any other valuable thing\u201d and does not require proof, as does Count Five, that the money sought is \u201cfor the purpose of influencing [a public official] in the performance of his official duties\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-5\">The two offenses charged are not the same and we see no inconsistency in a finding of guilt as to each, even though the proscribed conduct arose from the same transaction. The fact that a public official may demand money to influence the performance of his official duties, and thus be guilty of bribery, does not mean that he may not also be guilty of violating the separate crime provided in Article 27, Section 562 (extortion), if the demand for money is accompanied by a threat that unless it is paid he will \u201cdo ... injury to the person or property\u201d of the party upon whom the demand is made.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-6\">It should be noted that conviction of neither Count Five nor Count Thirteen required proof of payment to the appellant. It follows that, contrary to appellant\u2019s assertion, there was no \u201cfinding of voluntary payment implicit in the conviction of Bribery [Count Five]\u201d. The claim of inconsistency, therefore, rests on a false premise and is without merit. The cases from other jurisdictions, <em>People v. Dioguardi, </em>8 N.Y.2d 260, 203 N.Y.S.2d 870, 168 N.E.2d 683 (1960), and <em>Commonwealth v. Francis, </em>201 Pa. Super, 313, 191 A.2d 884 (1963), cited by the appellant to the effect that under certain circumstances and under certain statutes bribery and extortion are mutually exclusive crimes do not persuade us otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-7\">\n<em>Judgments affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b278-8\">\n<em>Costs to be paid by appellant.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b276-10\">. Art. 27, Section 562 provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-11\">\u201cEvery person who shall threaten ... to do any injury to the person or property of anyone, with a view to extort or gain any money ... shall be guilty of a felony____\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b277-8\">. On Count Five appellant received a sentence of three years and a fine of $5,000.00. On Count Thirteen he received a concurrent term of imprisonment (three years) but no fine. In addition, as part of the total sentence in the ease, the appellant was required to \u201cmake restitution to the State of Maryland [of] the sum of Sixteen thousand five hundred dollars representing the bribes you have been found to have received in this case, and the three thousand dollars representing the sum that you have been found to have extorted\u201d. It seems likely that, although Count Thirteen is the only extortion count of which appellant was found guilty, the judge was actually referring to Count Eleven in requiring restitution of $3,000.00, for it was that count that charged appellant with, on or about May 23, 1973, \u201cdemand[ing] and receiving] a bribe ... in the approximate amount of three thousand dollars ($3,000.00)\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-9\">We note that neither the bribery statute nor the extortion statute under which the appellant was charged provide for restitution as part of the penalty for their violation. The appellant, however, does not challenge here the legality of that part of his sentence. But see Md. Rule 774.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
