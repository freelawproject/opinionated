The district court sentenced Contreras to concurrent terms of 408 months of imprisonment for conspiring to possess and for possessing with intent to distribute cocaine and cocaine base. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1), 841(b)(1), 846. Later, the district court reduced Contreras\u2019s sentences to concurrent terms of 293 months of imprisonment. Contreras sought a further reduction based on a fast-track program established by the Department of Justice. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-10\">The district court did not err. A district court may sometimes reduce a sentence of imprisonment when it was based on a guidelines range that has since been lowered, United States Sentencing Guidelines Manual \u00a7 lB1.10(l)(l)-(2), (c), but Contreras cannot obtain a reduction of his sentence based on a program created by the Department of Justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-11\">We AFFIRM the denial of Contreras\u2019s motion to reduce his sentence.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
