On appeal, Adams argues that the district court erred by applying the cross-reference of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(c)(l)(A) to calculate her base level offense because there was insufficient evidence that Adams possessed the gun in connection with the commission of an attempted murder. After review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-12\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b792-13\">A. Offense Conduct</p>\n<p id=\"b792-14\">At the outset, we note that the vast majority of the facts recounted here are undisputed and thus are admitted. On October 3, 2011, Defendant Adams, who was on probation for a felony kidnapping at the time,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and a female associate, Kimberly Pickron, took Rachel Lents<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> on a car ride out of Mobile, Alabama, under the false pretense of meeting wealthy prostitution clients. After driving approximately 100 miles on a rural road, Adams pulled off the road. Adams then brandished a small black revolver, and informed Lents that \u201c[Adams] brought her to the area \u2018to put a bullet in her head.\u2019 \u201d Lents jumped out of the vehicle and began running toward a wooded area.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-15\">What happened next is disputed by Defendant Adams. According to the Presen-tence Investigation Report (\u201cPSI\u201d), Lents heard multiple gunshots fired with several bullets impacting the ground around her. Adams denied firing at Lents.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> It is undisputed that Lents then crawled into the trees, sustaining numerous wounds, and remained there until Lents believed Adams had left the area. Thereafter, Lents sought refuge in a nearby home, and the police were called.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-16\">Clarke County Sheriffs Office Investigators Ron Baggette and Virgil Chapman interviewed Lents within 30 minutes after the incident was reported. The investigators also interviewed the resident of the home to which Lents retreated, who stated that he heard four shots. Investigator <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"767\">*767</page-number>Baggette next searched Adams\u2019s vehicle, pursuant to a warrant, and found Adams\u2019s driver\u2019s license, three plastic bags of crack cocaine, a small black revolver holding four spent .38-ealiber shells, and one live round of .38-caliber hollow-point ammunition.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-5\">The following day, Investigators Bag-gette and Chapman interviewed Defendant Adams, who admitted to having lured Lents to the remote area under false pretenses. Adams stated that she meant to simply leave Lents there in retribution for Lents having slept with Adams\u2019s husband. Adams initially denied owning a firearm. When Investigator Baggette confronted her with the revolver taken from her vehicle, Adams admitted to owning the weapon and to firing \u201ca few rounds in the air\u201d to scare Lents off after Lents had fled Adams\u2019s car. Adams maintained, however, that she did not shoot at Lents.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-6\">In addition to her federal firearm charge, Adams was also charged in state court with attempted murder. At the time of her federal sentencing, Adams\u2019s state court criminal proceedings were still pending.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-7\">B. Presentence Investigation Report</p>\n<p id=\"b793-8\">The PSI calculated Defendant Adams\u2019s base offense level of 33 by applying a cross-reference to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2A2.1(a)(l), as mandated by U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(e)(l), based on Adams\u2019s use of the firearm in the commission of attempted murder. The probation officer noted that although the base offense level for possession of a firearm by a felon is usually determined by \u00a7 2K2.1, and that under that guideline Adams\u2019s offense level would be 24, the application of \u00a7 2K2.1(e)\u2019s cross-reference is proper where, as here, the firearm is used in connection with the commission of a connected offense, here, attempted murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-9\">After applying a 3-point reduction for timely acceptance of responsibility, the PSI arrived at a total offense level of 30. When coupled with Adams\u2019s criminal history category of III, that offense level yielded an advisory guidelines range of 121 to 151 months. As the maximum statutory penalty was 10 years, the PSI recommended a guidelines range of 120 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-10\">Adams objected to the application of the cross-reference to \u00a7 2A2.1(a)(l) because she maintained that the firearm was not used in connection with the commission of another offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-11\">C. Sentencing Hearing</p>\n<p id=\"b793-12\">At sentencing, the government presented two witnesses to show that Adams used the firearm in connection with the commission of an attempted murder: (1) Investigator Baggette, who recounted his interviews with Lents and Adams, and (2) Special Agent Nicholas Murphy of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, who testified about Adams\u2019s prior kidnapping conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-13\">Over Defendant Adams\u2019s hearsay objection, Investigator Baggette testified that Lents said she heard bullets striking around her while she fled and after she had fallen to the ground after running. Although Investigator Baggette acknowledged that Lents admitted to being a drug addict, he stated that he did not observe any indications of Lents being under the influence of any substance while giving her statement. The government then played a portion of Lents\u2019s videotaped statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-14\">As to his interview with Adams, Investigator Baggette testified that Adams initially lied about possessing a firearm and only recanted when confronted with the weapon removed from her car. Baggette verified that Adams admitted to having fired the weapon four times, but that Adams insisted that she fired into the air and not at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"768\">*768</page-number>Lents. Investigator Baggette also confirmed that Adams admitted that she was mad at Lents for Lents having slept with Adams\u2019s husband. Investigator Baggette denied hearing that Adams was simply going to let Lents go from anyone but Defendant Adams herself.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-4\">Special Agent Murphy then testified about Adams\u2019s 2009 conviction for kidnapping. He confirmed that Adams, holding a black handgun, and a male accomplice ambushed a female acquaintance on the street and forced her into a car. Adams drove the vehicle to a remote location, where Adams and her accomplice beat the victim for the alleged theft of money from Adams and others. They then placed the victim, tied hand and foot, in the trunk of the car, and drove the vehicle to an abandoned house before releasing her. During cross-examination, Special Agent Murphy acknowledged that no bullets were fired during the 2009 kidnapping.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-5\">Defendant Adams called no witnesses. Instead, Adams argued that the government\u2019s evidence was insufficient to support a finding that the gun was used in connection with an attempted murder.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b794-6\">Prior to ruling on Adams\u2019s objection, the district court made a specific finding by clear and convincing evidence that \u201cMs. Adams did commit the attempted murder on Ms. Lent[s] [and that] the evidence is sufficient to support that finding by the [c]ourt.\u201d The district court further pointed to the \u201cthin line of difference between what the [defendant has admitted and what the victim ha[d] said actually happened.\u201d Specifically, the district court referred to the uncontested facts that Adams threatened to \u201cput a bullet in [Lents\u2019s] head,\u201d and that Adams fired multiple shots.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-9\">The district court then overruled Adams\u2019s objection on the basis of the district court\u2019s factual finding and adopted the PSI\u2019s recommendations without change. The district court sentenced Adams to 120-months\u2019 imprisonment, the statutory maximum. The district court rejected Adams\u2019s argument for a lower sentence, by stating that Adams\u2019s offense was \u201cextremely dangerous, extremely life threatening\u201d and that, along with Adams\u2019s prior kidnapping conviction, it reflected a \u201cpersonal pattern of behavior and how [Adams] deal[s] with conflict.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b794-10\">II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b794-11\">We review a district court\u2019s application of the Sentencing Guidelines <em>de novo </em>and its factual determinations for clear error. <em>United States v. Rhind, </em>289 F.3d 690, 693 (11th Cir.2002). \u201cA trial court\u2019s choice between \u2018two permissible views of the evidence\u2019 is the very essence of the clear error standard of review.\u201d <em>United States v. Rodriguez De Varon, </em>175 F.3d 930, 945 (11th Cir.1999) (en banc) (quoting <em>Anderson v. City of Bessemer City, </em>470 U.S. 564, 574, 105 S.Ct. 1504, 1511, 84 L.Ed.2d 518 (1985)). Thus, we will not \u201cdisturb a district court\u2019s findings [absent] \u2018a definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Ghertler, </em>605 F.3d 1256, 1267 (11th Cir. 2010) (internal quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b795-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"769\">*769</page-number>III. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b795-5\">On appeal, Adams argues that the district court clearly erred in finding that she committed attempted murder in conjunction with unlawful possession of the firearm. As a result, the district court improperly applied U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(c)(l)(A)\u2019s cross-reference to \u00a7 2A2.1(a)(l)\u2019s base offense level guidelines for attempted murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-7\">A. Section 2K2.1\u2019s Cross-Reference Provision</p>\n<p id=\"b795-8\">If the defendant committed or attempted to commit a crime while unlawfully possessing a firearm, \u00a7 2K2.1\u2019s cross-reference provision instructs the district court to apply \u00a7 2X1.1, the guideline for attempt, to calculate the defendant\u2019s offense level, \u201cif the resulting offense level is greater than\u201d the offense level calculated under \u00a7 2K2.1. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1 (c)(1)(A). The guideline for attempt, in turn, directs the district court to apply \u201c[t]he base offense level from the guideline for the substantive offense.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Xl.l(a). The guideline for the substantive offense of attempted murder, \u00a7 2A2.1(a)(l), assigns a defendant a base offense level of 33 for a first degree murder attempt. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2A2.1(a)(l).</p>\n<p id=\"b795-9\">In this case, the district court found that Defendant Adams attempted to murder Lents. Thus, if the application of the attempted murder guideline produces a higher offense level than would otherwise be obtained by applying the unlawful firearm possession guideline, then \u00a7 2K2.1 (c)(1)(A) mandates that the district court apply the attempted murder guideline to determine Adams\u2019s offense level. Here, the probation officer determined that under \u00a7 2K2.1, the unlawful firearm possession guideline, Adams\u2019s offense level would be 24. However, under \u00a7 2A2.1 (a)(1), the attempted murder guideline, Adams\u2019s offense level was 33. Accordingly, assuming that the district court\u2019s attempted murder finding is not clearly erroneous, the district court was required to use the attempted murder guideline rather than the unlawful firearm possession guideline to determine Adams\u2019s offense level. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1 (c)(1)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b795-11\">B. District Court\u2019s Finding of Attempted Murder</p>\n<p id=\"b795-12\">We first reject Adams\u2019s claim that the district court impermissibly relied on hearsay testimony. At sentencing hearings, district courts may \u201cconsider relevant information without regard to its admissibility under the rules of evidence applicable at trial, provided that the information has sufficient indicia of reliability to support its probable accuracy.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 6A1.3(a); <em>see also United States v. Baker, </em>432 F.3d 1189, 1253-54 (11th Cir.2005). Hearsay evidence, including statements by absent witnesses, can be relied on at sentencing, so long as the evidence bears \u201csufficient indicia of reliability\u201d and \u201cthe defendant ha[d] an opportunity to rebut the evidence.\u201d <em>Baker, </em>432 F.3d at 1253; <em>United States v. Gordon, </em>231 F.3d 750, 760-61 (11th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b795-13\">Here, the district court was permitted to rely on Investigator Baggette\u2019s testimony and Lents\u2019s videotaped statement to find that Defendant Adams attempted to murder Lents because Lents\u2019s hearsay statement was corroborated by other evidence and was reliable, and because Adams testified and had an opportunity to rebut that evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-14\">First, as the district court noted, Lents\u2019s statement, taken within 30 minutes after the incident was reported, and Adams\u2019s version of events were nearly identical. Adams\u2019s account differs from that of Lents <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"770\">*770</page-number>only in two regards.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Lents stated that Adams fired at her, while Adams claimed firing into the air. And, Adams insisted that she told Lents that Adams was letting Lents go instead of killing her.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-4\">Second, by corroborating much of Lents\u2019s statement, Adams\u2019s own confession obliterates the \u201cthin line of difference\u201d between both accounts. Adams admitted to luring Lents out to a remote rural area under false pretenses. Adams confessed to pointing a gun at Lents and telling Lents that she had brought her to a remote area to \u201cput a bullet\u201d in her head. Adams further acknowledged that her act was driven by her anger over Lents\u2019s sleeping with Adams\u2019s husband. Importantly, Adams admitted to firing her weapon four times.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-5\">Moreover, Adams\u2019s lies to police about the fact that she did not own a gun, coupled with the circumstances surrounding her prior violent kidnapping conviction, lent reliability to the disputed portion of Lents\u2019s account. Thus, Lents\u2019s statement, as reported by Investigator Baggette, bore sufficient indicia of reliability and was properly considered by the district court. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 6A1.3(a); <em>see also Baker, </em>432 F.3d at 1253-54.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-6\">Third, we find no merit to Defendant Adams\u2019s claim that Adams was denied the opportunity to attack Lents\u2019s credibility, in violation of the Federal Rules of Evidence. After the district court viewed portions of the video recordings of Lents\u2019s statement, taken within 30 minutes after the incident was reported, Adams cross-examined Investigator Baggette about possible inconsistencies. Further, the district court heard Investigator Baggette verify that Lents identified herself as a prostitute and a drug addict, but that Baggette did not observe any indication of Lents being under the influence at the time Lents gave the statement. And Adams was at no time precluded from presenting her version of events. The district court ultimately weighed the evidence and chose to believe Lents over Adams. The Federal Rules of Evidence did not bar any of this evidence from being heard and considered by the district court. Because Defendant Adams had the opportunity to and did rebut the evidence during cross-examination, her claim fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-9\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b796-10\">For all these reasons, we conclude that the district court did not clearly err in finding that Defendant Adams had committed attempted murder. Consequently, the district court properly cross-referenced Adams\u2019s base offense level from unlawful possession of a firearm to attempted murder. Accordingly, we affirm Adams\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b792-10\">. Adams was convicted of second degree kidnapping in state court on November 30, 2009.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b792-11\">. The victim's last name is spelled \"Lents\u201d in the PSI and \"Lentz\" in the sentencing hearing transcript. For consistency, the PSI\u2019s spelling \"Lents\u201d is used throughout this opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b792-17\">.In a factual resume signed by Defendant Adams and submitted to the district court, Adams admitted that she confessed to driving Lents out to the remote area under false pretenses and to firing a gun.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b794-7\">. Adams also objected to the district court\u2019s admission of Lents's statement into evidence through Investigator Baggette\u2019s testimony, in violation of her Sixth Amendment right to confront her accuser. The district court overruled Adams's objection, and Adams has abandoned her Sixth Amendment challenge on appeal. <em>See United States v. Cunningham, </em>161 F.3d 1343, 1344 (11th Cir.1998) (noting that an issue is deemed abandoned when the defendant fails to offer an argument on that issue on appeal).</p>\n<p id=\"b794-14\">We also note that Lents's whereabouts were unknown at the time of the sentencing hearing.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b796-7\">. Adams points to a perceived inconsistency in Lents\u2019s statement At one point, Lents told Investigator Baggette that Lents heard bullets impact the ground next to her after she fell to the ground. At another point, Lents told Bag-gette that she heard the gunshots after Lents exited Adams's vehicle. But even if Lents was inconsistent as to whether she heard the gunshots while running or after having fallen to the ground, Lents was clear that she heard bullets strike the ground. This one minor inconsistency, by itself, does not undermine the reliability of her statement.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
