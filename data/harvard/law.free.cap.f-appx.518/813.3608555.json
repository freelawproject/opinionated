After the VA sent Berkery\u2019s medical records to Dr. Kaplan, Dr. Kaplan notified Berkery that he would not perform the surgery, citing Berkery\u2019s substance abuse. Another surgeon later performed the surgery. Berkery alleged that Dr. Kaplan\u2019s refusal to treat him stemmed from discrimination based on Berkery\u2019s bipolar condition, thereby violating Title III of the ADA and the RA, and sought monetary damages as his sole form of relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-4\">We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s <em>sua sponte </em>dismissal under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii) of an <em>informa pauperis </em>complaint for failure to state a claim on which relief may be granted. <em>Hughes v. Lott, </em>350 F.3d 1157, 1159-60 (11th Cir. 2003). Dismissal is appropriate if the complaint, on its face, does not state a plausible claim for relief, <em>Ashcroft v. Iqbal, </em>556 U.S. 662, 678, 129 S.Ct. 1937, 173 L.Ed.2d 868 (2009), mindful that <em>pro se </em>pleadings must be liberally construed. <em>Tannenbaum v. United States, </em>148 F.3d 1262, 1263 (11th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b840-6\">The district court properly dismissed Berkery\u2019s claim under Title III of the ADA because, as this Court has noted, \u201cthere is no private right of action for money damages\u201d under Title III, which provides for money damages <em>only </em>where the civil action is initiated by the Attorney General. <em>Jairath v. Dyer, </em>154 F.3d 1280, 1283 and n. 7 (1998). We have further noted that a plaintiff in Berkery\u2019s position, who has already received the refused medical treatment from another doctor, lacks standing to assert a claim for injunctive relief under Title III. <em>Id. </em>at 1283 n. 8 (explaining that because the plaintiff already received the refused medical procedure from another doctor there was \u201cno remedy under the ADA for defendant\u2019s past act of refusing treatment\u201d and therefore the plaintiff lacked standing under the ADA).</p>\n<p id=\"b840-7\">The district court also properly dismissed Berkery\u2019s claim under the RA because his complaint did not allege any violation under that act. The RA states, in relevant part, that, \u201c[n]o otherwise qualified individual with a disability ... shall, solely by reason of her or his disability, be excluded from the participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance.\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794(a). However, Dr. Kap-lan\u2019s medical services are not a \u201cprogram or activity\u201d as that term is defined under the act, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 794(b), nor does the act <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"815\">*815</page-number>provide for individual liability.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>See, e.g., Garcia v. S.U.N.Y. Health Scis. Ctr. of Brooklyn, </em>280 F.3d 98, 107 (2d Cir.2001) (explaining that \u00a7 504 of the RA does not provide for individual capacity suits).</p>\n<p id=\"b841-5\">Consequently, the order of the district court is AFFIRMED IN PART, and the remainder of Berkery\u2019s appeal is DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b840-5\">. Berkery also contends that the district court erred in dismissing claims brought under state law. However, because Berkery\u2019s notice of appeal specifically limited his appeal to the district court\u2019s dismissal of his claims under Title II of the ADA and the RA, and explicitly stated that he withdrew his state law claims, we dismiss Berkery's appeal regarding his state law claims for want of jurisdiction. <em>See Ostemeck v. E.T. Barwick Indus., Inc., </em>825 F.2d 1521, 1528 (11th Cir.1987), <em>affirmed, </em>489 U.S. 169, 109 S.Ct 987, 103 L.Ed.2d 146 (1989) (\u201d[W]e will not expand [a notice of appeal] to include judgments and orders not specified unless the overriding intent to appeal these orders is readily apparent on the face of the notice.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b841-15\">. Berkery also contends that the district court erred in dismissing his claims under the ADA and RA with prejudice. However, as he raises this argument for the first time in his reply brief, we consider this claim abandoned and do not consider it. <em>Timson v. Sampson, </em>518 F.3d 870, 874 (11th Cir.2008) (deeming as abandoned issues that a <em>pro se </em>litigant raises for the first time in a reply brief).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
