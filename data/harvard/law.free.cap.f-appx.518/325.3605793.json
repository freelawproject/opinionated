We AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-26\">The Section 2254 petition asserted that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to convey to Jimenez the State\u2019s plea offer of 25 years of imprisonment. The state ha-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>beas court, relying on an affidavit of trial counsel denying any knowledge of a 25-year offer, concluded that Jimenez failed to prove that such an offer was ever made. The district court, however, considered an affidavit of trial counsel, never introduced in state court, in which he stated that there had indeed been a 25-year offer that was conveyed to and rejected by Jimenez. We granted Jimenez a certificate of ap-pealability on the following issues: whether it was proper for the district court to consider the affidavit of Jimenez\u2019s counsel that was not presented to the state court; whether the district court was required under Section 2254(d)(2) to defer to the state court\u2019s ruling as one not based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in state court, even though the state court\u2019s decision was based on affidavit testimony later recanted in federal court; and whether the district court erred by finding that Jimenez did not suffer prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-4\">For a claim adjudicated on the merits in a state habeas proceeding, \u201cevidence later introduced in federal court is irrelevant.\u201d <em>Cullen v. Pinholster, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 1388, 1400, 179 L.Ed.2d 557 (2011) (concerning review under Section 2254(d)(1)). \u201cThe same rule necessarily applies to a federal court\u2019s review of purely factual determinations under \u00a7 2254(d)(2).\u201d <em>Blue v. Thaler, </em>665 F.3d 647, 656 (5th Cir.2011), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 133 S.Ct. 105, 184 L.Ed.2d 49 (2012). <em>Pinholster </em>suggests that an exception may lie, however, if a habeas petitioner presents \u201ca new claim\u201d turning on evidence never presented in the state court, such as \u201cnew evidence of withheld exculpatory witness statements.\u201d 131 S.Ct. at 1401 n. 10; <em>see also id. </em>at 1417-18 (Sotomayor, J., dissenting); <em>cf. Blue, </em>665 F.3d at 657.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-9\">Jimenez argues that counsel\u2019s federal affidavit did not modify his state court claim but merely supplemented it and that the claim was therefore not a new and unexhausted claim. He partly relies on <em>Dowthitt v. Johnson, </em>230 F.3d 733 (5th Cir.2000), and <em>Lewis v. Quarterman, </em>541 F.3d 280 (5th Cir.2008). These decisions are no longer good law on the points he raises in light of <em>Pinholster, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 131 S.Ct. 1388, 179 L.Ed.2d 557. The question of whether to consider evidence never presented to the state court is not analyzed as an exhaustion issue under Section 2254(b). <em>Lewis v. Thaler, </em>701 F.3d 783, 790-96 (5th Cir.2012). Jimenez has thus failed to cite any authority supporting his contention that counsel\u2019s federal affidavit could be considered when deciding whether to defer to the state court\u2019s resolution of his claim of constitutional error.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-12\">Additionally, Jimenez fails to show that, based on the record before the state habe-as court, \u201cno fairminded jurist could agree with\u201d that court\u2019s conclusion that counsel did not render deficient services. <em>See Bobby v. Dixon, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 132 S.Ct. 26, 27, 181 L.Ed.2d 328 (2011). Indeed, Jimenez does not even attempt the effort, electing instead to pretermit the question of deficient performance.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-14\">The district court made no determination concerning the propriety of the state habeas court\u2019s conclusion that counsel had not rendered deficient performance; the district court merely assumed deficient performance for the purpose of the prejudice analysis. Whether the state court erred in its conclusion of no deficiency is a question that has been abandoned on appeal as a result of Jimenez\u2019s decision not to brief the performance issue. <em>See Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 224-25 (5th Cir. 1993). Jimenez\u2019s discussion of the prejudice issue is therefore irrelevant. <em>See Hill v. Lockhart, </em>474 U.S. 52, 58, 106 S.Ct. 366, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>88 L.Ed.2d 203 (1985). His motion for the appointment of counsel is DENIED, and the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b351-27\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
