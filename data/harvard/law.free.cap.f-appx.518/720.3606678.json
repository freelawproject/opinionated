The district court sentenced him to 18 months\u2019 imprisonment, to be followed by a 10-year term of supervised release. On appeal, Mr. Corl challenges the supervised release term as substantively unreasonable, arguing that the district did not adequately justify such a lengthy period of supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-19\">Insofar as procedural and substantive reasonableness concerned, our review is for abuse of discretion. <em>See Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). For the reasons which follow, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-20\">We find no abuse of discretion with respect to the 10-year term of supervised release. First, we note that the district court had to impose a minimum 5-year term of supervised release, and could have placed Mr. Corl on supervised release for life. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(k). Second, Mr. Corl had two prior convictions for sex-related misconduct (a battery in 1999 for improperly touching an 8-year old girl and an attempted second-degree rape in 2005 involving his nephew\u2019s girlfriend). <em>See </em>Presentence Investigation Report at \u00b6\u00b6 31-32. Third, Mr. Corl had failed to register as a sex offender for several years following his release from prison in 2008. <em>See </em>Change of Plea Hearing Transcript [D.E. 49] at 17-18. On this record, the district court had sufficient reason to conclude that \u201ca lengthy term of supervision [was] warranted.\u201d <em>See </em>Order on Defendant\u2019s Objection to Sentence [D.E. 39] at 1. <em>See also United States v. Brewer, </em>628 F.3d 975, 978 (8th Cir.2010) (upholding 15-year term of supervised release for defendant who failed to register as a sex offender).</p>\n<p id=\"b746-21\">We also find no procedural error. Not only did the district court expressly say that a lengthy term of supervised release was necessary, the record showed that Mr. Corl traveled to other states to work as a welder, and the district court explained that during \u201cthe term of supervised release the probation officer can help [Mr. Corl] comply with the registration requirements and allow him to engage in work opportunities.\u201d <em>See </em>Order on Defendant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"721\">*721</page-number>Objection to Sentence at 1. This is not a case like <em>United States v. Fraga, </em>704 F.3d 432, 441-42 (5th Cir.2013), where the district court erred by suggesting that it \u201cautomatically defaulted to the imposition of a lifetime term\u201d of supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
