Arrellano argues that the district court erred by applying a 16-level enhancement under United States Sentencing Guidelines \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii) based on a prior conviction for a crime of violence. She maintains that her Texas conviction for kidnapping under Tex. Penal Code \u00a7 20.03(a) was not a conviction for a crime of violence because Tex. Penal Code \u00a7 20.03(a) does not have as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of force and because Tex. Penal Code \u00a7 20.03(a) does not comport with the contemporary, generic offense of kidnapping. We review the district court\u2019s interpretation or application of the Guidelines de novo, and its factual findings for clear error. <em>United States v. Cisneros-Gutierrez, </em>517 F.3d 751, 764 (5th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b320-21\">In <em>United States v. Garcia-Gonzalez, </em>168 Fed.Appx. 564, 565 (5th Cir.2006), we held that \u201c[t]he elements of the Texas kidnapping offense are consistent with the ordinary, contemporary, and common understanding of the term as defined by Black\u2019s Law Dictionary,\u201d and we determined that the application of a 16-level enhancement under \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii) based upon a conviction under Tex. Penal Code \u00a7 20.03(a) was not plain error. In a subsequent published opinion, we held that a conviction under a nearly identical New York kidnapping statute was a conviction for a crime of violence under \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii). <em>United States v. Iniguez-Barba, </em>485 F.3d 790, 791-93 (5th Cir. 2007). We have also described <em>Garcia-Gonzalez </em>as \u201can unpublished case which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>held that the enumerated offense of \u2018kidnapping\u201d included a Texas statute that was nearly identical to the New York statute and likewise lacked the requirement of risk of injury or involuntary servitude.\u201d <em>United States v. Moreno-Florean, </em>542 F.3d 445, 453 (5th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b321-5\">Arrellano acknowledges the opinions in <em>Garcia-Gonzalez </em>and <em>Moreno-Florean. </em>She asserts that <em>Garciar-Gonzalez </em>is not controlling because that case was reviewed under the plain error standard and because the opinion was unpublished. She maintains that this court misconstrued <em>Garcia-Gonzalez </em>in <em>Moreno-Florean </em>for the same reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-6\">While <em>Garcia-Gonzalez </em>is an unpublished opinion, <em>Iniguez-Barba </em>and <em>Moreno-Florean </em>are published opinions that resolve this issue against Arrellano. <em>See Iniguez-Barba, </em>485 F.3d at 791-93; <em>Moreno-Florean, </em>542 F.3d at 453. As Arrella-no has not shown the existence of an intervening statutory change, Supreme Court decision, or en banc decision of this court, we must follow <em>Iniguez-Barba </em>and <em>Moreno-Florean. See United States v. Snarr, </em>704 F.3d 368, 402 n. 21 (5th Cir.2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b321-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b320-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
