We granted a certificate of appeala-bility on the sole issue of \u201c[wjhether the district court violated <em>Clisby v. Jones, </em>960 F.2d 925, 936 (11th Cir.1992), and <em>Rhode v. United States, </em>583 F.3d 1289, 1291 (11th Cir.2009), when it failed to address Harris\u2019s argument that his plea was invalid because counsel misadvised him as to the sentencing consequences of entering a guilty plea.\u201d After review, we conclude <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"727\">*727</page-number>that the district court complied with <em>Clisby </em>and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-5\">In <em>Clisby, </em>this Court instructed district courts to resolve all claims for relief raised in a habeas petition prior to granting or denying relief. <em>Clisby, </em>960 F.2d at 936. If the district court does not address all claims prior to issuing judgment, we \u201cwill vacate the district court\u2019s judgment without prejudice and remand the case for consideration of all remaining claims.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 938; <em>see also Rhode, </em>583 F.3d at 1291 (applying <em>Clisby </em>in the \u00a7 2255 context).</p>\n<p id=\"b753-6\">Harris\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion alleged, in relevant part, that his counsel advised him it was in his best interests to plead guilty because he would \u201cget a sentenee[ ] between 21 to 37 months,\u201d but did not tell Harris he faced a sentencing enhancement for assault.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Harris further alleged that but for \u201ccounsel's] bad information,\u201d he would have proceeded to trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-7\">With respect to this claim, the district court adopted the magistrate judge\u2019s report, which stated that: (1) Harris\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion claimed \u201cthat he should be let out of his plea\u201d because his counsel misadvised him that a plea would result in a 21-to-37-month sentence; (2) Harris claimed that, if not for his counsel\u2019s \u201cbad information!,] Harris would have gone to trial\u201d; (3) \u201cHarris points to nothing to show that his plea was involuntary\u201d and did not \u201ccite any other valid legal grounds for undoing his guilty plea\u201d; (4) Harris \u201cdoes not deny that the guilty-plea judge thoroughly explained to him his maximum sentence exposure, ... and that at best his lawyer could only estimate, not promise, a sentence within that maximum range\u201d; and (6) \u201cHarris does not claim that he was misled about, or misunderstood, any of that.\u201d In other words, the district court concluded that Harris\u2019s claim was foreclosed by his plea colloquy.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-12\">Moreover, the district court included citations to the pertinent portions of the plea hearing it relied upon in rejecting Harris\u2019s claim. Specifically, the plea colloquy cited in the report, adopted by the district court, showed that: (1) Harris was advised of the maximum ten-year sentence he faced under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g); (2) Harris had discussed the sentencing guidelines with his counsel and understood that the sentencing guidelines were advisory; (3) the district court explained to Harris that the court would consider the sentencing guidelines range along with other factors in deciding what sentence to impose; (4) the district court warned Harris that any estimate his counsel had given him as to the guidelines range or the sentence that might be imposed was merely an estimate because his counsel \u201ccan\u2019t know, because I don\u2019t know until I see this Presentence Report, what the range will be or what the sentence in my view should be\u201d; (5) Harris indicated that he understood that even if his counsel\u2019s estimate was mistaken, he would still be bound by his plea agreement; and (6) Harris agreed that no one, including his counsel, had made any promises to him that were not in the plea agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-13\">In sum, we conclude that the district court\u2019s resolution of Harris\u2019s involuntary plea claim, while brief, was sufficient to comply with <em>Clisby. See Long v. United States, </em>626 F.3d 1167, 1170 (11th Cir.2010) (stating that a district court reviewing a \u00a7 2255 motion must \u201cfacilitate meaningful appellate review by developing adequate factual records and making sufficiently clear findings as to the key issues\u201d); <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"728\">*728</page-number><em>Broadwater v. United States, </em>292 F.3d 1302, 1303 (11th Cir.2002) (explaining that simple \u00a7 2255 claims that obviously have no merit may not require extensive explanation).</p>\n<p id=\"b754-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b753-8\">. At sentencing, Harris received, <em>inter alia, </em>a six-level increase, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3A1.2(c), for assaulting a law enforcement officer. His advisory guidelines range was 92 to 115 months' imprisonment.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
