Liberally construed, Waterfield argues on appeal that the Florida state courts did not have jurisdiction over his criminal prosecution, and that the judges violated his rights by denying his post-conviction motions on procedural grounds. After consideration of Waterfield\u2019s brief and careful review of the record, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-4\">As an initial matter, the district court did not err by <em>sua sponte </em>dismissing Wa-terfield\u2019s complaint without requiring a response from the judges. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A establishes a screening procedure for prisoner complaints that requires the district court to review a complaint and dismiss it for failing to state a claim as soon as possible, preferably before the complaint is even docketed. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A(a). As such, dismissal prior to a responsive pleading from the judges was not only permissible, but was encouraged by the statute. <em>Cf. Vanderberg v. Donaldson, </em>259 F.3d 1321, 1323-24 (11th Cir.2001) (holding that 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii), a provision analogous to \u00a7 1915A, allows a district court to <em>sua sponte </em>dismiss a prisoner\u2019s complaint for failure to state a claim before service of process).</p>\n<p id=\"b694-5\">Dismissal of Waterfield\u2019s complaint, moreover, was warranted under \u00a7 1915A.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The judges were absolutely immune from civil liability for their handling of Water-field\u2019s criminal case and post-conviction proceedings. <em>See, e.g., Sibley v. Lando, </em>437 F.3d 1067, 1070 (11th Cir.2005); <em>Bolin v. Story, </em>225 F.3d 1234, 1239 (11th Cir. 2000). The district court, furthermore, did not err by refusing to issue an injunction instructing the judges on how they should have resolved Waterfield\u2019s state-court proceedings, or detailing what actions they should take in the future with regard to his criminal judgment. <em>See Pompey v. Broward Cnty., </em>95 F.3d 1543, 1546-50 &amp; n. 6 (11th Cir.1996) (discussing the principles of federalism, comity, and equity that militate against a federal judge issuing an injunction against state judges, even in the absence of ongoing state-court proceedings); <em>see also </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 (\u201c[I]n any action brought against a judicial officer for an act or omission taken in such officer\u2019s judicial capacity, injunctive relief shall not be granted unless a declaratory decree was violated or declaratory relief was unavailable.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b694-9\">To the extent Waterfield attempted to attack his criminal convictions, prisoners are prohibited from using \u00a7 1983 to challenge the fact or duration of their confinement. <em>See Wilkinson v. Dotson, </em>544 U.S. 74, 78, 125 S.Ct. 1242, 161 L.Ed.2d 253 (2005); <em>Heck v. Humphrey, </em>512 U.S. 477, 487, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994) (explaining that \u201cthe hoary principle that civil tort actions are not appropriate vehicles for challenging the validity of outstanding criminal judgments applies to \u00a7 1983 damages actions that necessarily require the plaintiff to prove the unlawfulness of his conviction or confinement\u201d). Waterfield\u2019s contention that the state courts lacked jurisdiction over his criminal proceedings would necessarily imply the invalidity of his criminal conviction, and \u00a7 1983 therefore was not an appropriate vehicle for his argument. <em>See Heck, </em>512 U.S. at 486-87, 114 S.Ct. 2364. Finally, the district court did not abuse its discretion by denying Waterfield\u2019s motion for rehearing or a new trial because Water-field simply sought to relitigate the merits of his \u00a7 1983 complaint. <em>See Wilchombe v. TeeVee Toons, Inc., </em>555 F.3d 949, 957 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>(llth Cir.2009) (\u201cA motion for reconsideration cannot be used to relitigate old matters, raise argument or present evidence that could have been raised prior to the entry of judgment.\u201d (quotation omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b695-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b694-6\">.
