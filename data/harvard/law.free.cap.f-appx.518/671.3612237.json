Stat. \u00a7 726.105(l)(a).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Creditor, responding to the petition, filed an adversary complaint seeking to except the debt from discharge under 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 523(a)(6). The Bankruptcy Court granted Creditor judgment on the ground that the state court judgment \u2014 which was based on a fraudulent transfer made with the \u201cactual intent to hinder, delay, or defraud a creditor\u201d \u2014 could support a \u00a7 528(a)(6) claim. The Bankruptcy Court then applied the doctrine of collateral es-toppel and found that all the elements of \u00a7 523(a)(6)\u2019s exception to discharge were met apart from the malice element. On the malice issue, the court ruled that Debt- or\u2019s reason for transferring the assets \u2014 to start a new business \u2014 did not constitute just cause because there was no evidence showing that his mistaken belief, that Creditor would forego its claim for rents, was in any way the result of Creditor\u2019s conduct or the parties\u2019 course of dealing. In fine, the court ruled that \u201cit would be a perversion of justice to allow [Debtor], who had actual intent to hinder, delay, or defraud [Creditor] and committed actual fraud, to maintain that he had just cause for doing so.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b698-10\">Debtor appealed the Bankruptcy Court\u2019s ruling to the District Court and it affirmed. Debtor now appeals the District Court\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-11\">We find no merit in Debtor\u2019s appeal. Debtor argued to the District Court that Florida\u2019s fraudulent transfer statute is remedial and does not create an independent cause of action \u2014 -that Creditor had nothing more than a debt arising from a breach of contract, and that such debts is not excepted from discharge in bankruptcy. The court properly rejected his argument, holding that while Creditor\u2019s claim originally arose out of contract, by virtue of Debtor\u2019s wrongful conduct it ripened into a judgment for fraudulent transfer. Debtor now contends that the court erred in this holding, and we disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-12\">Debtor also argues that the District Court\u2019s reliance on <em>In re Jennings, </em>670 F.3d 1329 (11th Cir.2012), \u201ceither runs roughshod over binding precedent of the United States Supreme Court and this Court, or must be limited to its facts or the law of the forum, California.\u201d App\u2019t Br. at 3 \u2014 4. Debtor conceded in the District Court that it was bound by <em>In re Jennings. </em>He must make the same concession here.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number>Finding no error in the District Court\u2019s decision, its judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b698-8\">. In a state court lawsuit between Creditor and Oceanside Automotive Service and Towing, LLC (\"Oceanside\u201d), Creditor obtained the judgment against Oceanside for past due rent. Thereafter, Debtor, the sole officer and insider of Oceanside, transferred Oceanside's assets to himself, to prevent Creditor from executing on its judgment. On learning of the transfer, Creditor impleaded Debtor, claiming that Debtor was a fraudulent transferee of Oceanside\u2019s assets. Creditor obtained the judgment at issue against Debtor pursuant to Florida\u2019s version of the Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act, Fla. Stat. 726.109(l)(a).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
