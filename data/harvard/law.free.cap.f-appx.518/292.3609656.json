The parties consented to proceed before a magistrate judge (MJ). Miles moved for summary judgment, asserting, inter alia, that he was entitled to qualified immunity. The MJ observed that Miles\u2019s version of events was \u201csignificantly different from Chatman\u2019s sworn hearing testimony.\u201d The MJ found that the evidence in the record raised \u201cquestions of fact as to whether Chatman presented a danger to anyone when he was taken into the room; whether any threat perceived by Miles was reasonable; whether force was necessary under the circumstances; and whether the force used was commensurate with the need for force, if any.\u201d Because \u201c[ejxactly what transpired in the room at the jail remains in dispute,\u201d and because a jury could find that Miles violated Chatman\u2019s right to be free from excessive force if Chatman\u2019s version of the events is credited, the MJ concluded that there were genuine issues of material fact regarding whether Miles was entitled to qualified immunity. Accordingly, the MJ denied Miles\u2019s motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-5\">Miles filed an interlocutory appeal challenging the denial of his summary judgment motion based on qualified immunity. The denial of a motion for summary judgment based upon qualified immunity is a collateral order capable of immediate review. <em>Mitchell v. Forsyth, </em>472 U.S. 511, 530, 105 S.Ct. 2806, 86 L.Ed.2d 411 (1985). However, the court\u2019s jurisdiction to review the denial is \u201csignificantly limited,\u201d extending to questions of law only. <em>Kinney v. Weaver, </em>367 F.3d 337, 346 (5th Cir.2004) (en banc). \u201cWhenever the district court denies an official\u2019s motion for summary judgment predicated upon qualified immunity, the district court can be thought of as making two distinct determinations, even if only implicitly.\u201d <em>Kinney, </em>367 F.3d at 346. \u201cFirst, the district court decides that a certain course of conduct would, as a matter of law, be objectively unreasonable in light of clearly established law. Second, the court decides that a genuine issue of fact exists regarding whether the defendants) did, in fact, engage in such conduct.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cAccording to the Supreme Court, as well as [this court\u2019s] own precedents, [this court] lack[s] jurisdiction to review conclusions of the <em>second </em>type on interlocutory appeal.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201c[The court does], however, have jurisdiction to the review the <em>first </em>type of determination, the purely legal question whether a given course of conduct would be objectively unreasonable in light of clearly established law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 347.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-9\">On appeal, Miles argues that the use of force was reasonable and necessary because Chatman lunged at him and Miles perceived Chatman as being dangerous to himself or others in the room. He further argues that Chatman suffered no more than a de minimis injury and that any lingering problems with his neck were related to a subsequent injury. Miles\u2019s arguments are directed at the truth of the factual allegations made by Chatman. By arguing that the force was justified in this case, Miles is essentially challenging the MJ\u2019s determination that genuine issues of material fact exist regarding exactly what took place in the room off of the booking <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>room. This is precisely the type of question that the court lacks jurisdiction to entertain in this interlocutory appeal. <em>See Kinney, </em>367 F.3d at 346. Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-4\">APPEAL DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b318-6\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
