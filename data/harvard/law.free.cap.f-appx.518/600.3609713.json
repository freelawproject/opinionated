In his petition, Drabek argues that the BIA abused its discretion in denying his motion to reopen because his counsel provided ineffective assistance.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-18\">We review the denial of a motion to reopen an immigration proceeding for an abuse of discretion, namely, whether the BIA exercised its discretion in an arbitrary or capricious manner. <em>Abdi v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>430 F.3d 1148, 1149 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b626-19\">We recognize that an alien may move to reopen his removal order on the basis of counsel\u2019s ineffective assistance in the context of a deportation hearing. <em>Dakane v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>399 F.3d 1269, 1272-74 (11th Cir.2004) (addressing merits of ineffective assistance claim where petitioner filed a timely motion to reopen). However, an alien is generally limited to filing one motion to reopen removal proceedings and must file it within 90 days of the date of the BIA\u2019s final administrative removal order. INA \u00a7 240(c)(7)(A), (C)(i), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(A), (C)(i); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(2). The 90-day filing deadline is \u201cmandatory and jurisdictional,\u201d and, therefore, not subject to equitable tolling. <em>See Abdi, </em>430 F.3d at 1150 &amp; n. 2 (finding no abuse of discretion in the BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to reopen based on an ineffective assistance of counsel claim because the motion was time-barred, and thus, declining to address ineffective assistance claim and denying petition). Indeed, we have declined to recognize equitable tolling for an untimely motion to reopen based upon ineffective assistance of counsel, \u201ceven where an alien acts blamelessly.\u201d <em>Anin v. Reno, </em>188 F.3d 1273, 1278-79 (11th Cir.1999). It is undisputed that Dra-bek\u2019s second motion to reopen was untimely and number-barred and, as we have noted, we do not recognize equitable tolling based upon ineffective assistance of counsel as the statutory time limitation is mandatory.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-21\">Alternatively, Drabek argues that the BIA should have exercised its discretionary authority to <em>sua sponte </em>reopen proceedings, even though Drabek never re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>quested that the BIA do so. In response to our jurisdictional question, Drabek asserts that we have jurisdiction over the BIA\u2019s decision not to reopen proceedings <em>sua sponte. </em>However, we lack jurisdiction to review a BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to reopen based on its <em>sua sponte </em>authority because 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(a) provides no meaningful standard against which to judge the BIA\u2019s exercise of its discretion. <em>Lenis v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>525 F.3d 1291, 1292-94 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b627-5\">PETITION DISMISSED IN PART, DENIED IN PART.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
