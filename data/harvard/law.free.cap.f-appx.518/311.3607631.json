Huff contends that his confinement to administrative segregation violates his due process rights because he was never given notice nor an opportunity to be present at the initial hearing placing him in administrative segregation. He further contends that prison rules and procedures were not followed in relation to his disciplinary hearings and that the Unit Classification Committee improperly classified him as a safety risk in order to keep him in administrative segregation. He also complains of the harsh conditions in administrative segregation, which include isolation from others, limited access to the law library, and no access to personal property. Huff further maintains that the defendants violated his constitutional rights by admitting him to the Jester IV Psychiatric Facility as a \u201c \u2018voluntar/ mental patient when he was incompetent to give informed consent to his admission.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b337-19\">Huff consented to proceed before a magistrate judge (MJ) pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(c). Because the MJ found that Huffs complaint was both frivolous and failed to state a claim under both 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e) and \u00a7 1915A, review is de novo. <em>See Geiger v. Jowers, </em>404 F.3d 371, 373 (5th Cir.2005). In the absence of extraordinary circumstances, administrative segregation does not impose an atypical and significant hardship required to trigger the protections of the Due Process Clause. <em>Hernandez v. Velasquez, </em>522 F.3d 556, 562-64 (5th Cir.2008). Huff has not demonstrated extraordinary circumstances in connection with his administrative segregation. <em>Cf. Wilkinson v. Austin, </em>545 U.S. 209, 214, 125 S.Ct. 2384, 162 L.Ed.2d 174 (2005); <em>Wilkerson v. Stalder, </em>329 F.3d 431, 433, 435-36 (5th Cir.2003). Further, Huffs claim that the defendants violated his due process rights by admitting him to Jester IV as a \u201c \u2018voluntary\u2019 mental patient when he was incompetent to give informed consent to the admission\u201d is raised for the first time before this court. As such, this court will not consider it. <em>See Jennings v. Owens, </em>602 F.3d at 652, 657 &amp; n. 7 (5th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b337-20\">Huff also contends that Sergeant Anita Wessels has kept him in administrative segregation in retaliation for naming her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>in past prison grievances. Filing a grievance is a constitutionally protected activity, and a prison official may not retaliate against a prisoner for engaging in a protected activity. <em>Woods v. Smith, </em>60 F.3d 1161, 1164 (5th Cir.1995). To state a retaliation claim, a prisoner \u201cmust allege the violation of a specific constitutional right and be prepared to establish that but for the retaliatory motive the complained of incident ... would not have occurred.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1166. Huff does not challenge the MJ\u2019s determination that even if he could establish that Sergeant Wessels signed the administrative segregation review with retaliatory intent, Huff could not establish that this action alone kept him in administrative segregation since other security personnel signed off on the monthly reviews. Huff also does not challenge the MJ\u2019s determination that his ineffectiveness claim against his counsel substitute is not a cognizable \u00a7 1988 claim. As such, he has abandoned these claims before this court. <em>See Brinkmann v. Dallas County Deputy Sheriff Abner, </em>813 F.2d 744, 748 (5th Cir.1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b338-4\">Huffs appeal lacks any issue of arguable merit, is therefore frivolous, and is dismissed as such. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983); 5th Cir. R. 42.2, This court\u2019s dismissal as frivolous and the district court\u2019s dismissal of Huffs \u00a7 1983 complaint as frivolous and for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted each count as a strike for purposes of \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 387-88 (5th Cir. 1996). Huff was previously warned that he had accumulated one strike from the district court\u2019s dismissal of his \u00a7 1983 action as frivolous and for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted. <em>See Huff v. Manfredi, </em>No. 12-40579, 2012 WL 6717363, at *3 (5th Cir. Dec.27, 2012) (unpublished). Because Huff has accumulated three strikes, he is now barred from proceeding in forma pauperis in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b338-6\">DISMISSED AS FRIVOLOUS; 28 U.S.G. \u00a7 1915(g) BAR IMPOSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b337-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
