He argues the district court improperly took into account conduct not charged in the indictment in arriving at his base offense level under the Sentencing Guidelines. After thorough review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-23\">In February 2011, federal and state law enforcement agents began a sting operation in Pensacola, Florida. Agents operated a pawn shop, called Anything for a Buck, and encouraged patrons to sell the shop firearms and contraband. In October 2011, Jackson, a convicted felon, sold a stolen .40 caliber pistol to agents at the shop. A grand jury indicted Jackson only for this conduct. But Jackson had visited Anything for a Buck before. In July, Jackson told agents at the shop that his friend had a sawed-off shotgun and was looking to sell it. Agents promised Jackson a $50 \u201cfinder\u2019s fee\u201d if his friend would sell the shotgun to the shop. Jackson agreed and brokered the sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-24\">Before Jackson\u2019s sentencing, the probation office prepared a presentence investigation report (PSI) listing as \u201coffense conduct\u201d all of Jackson\u2019s transactions with Anything for a Buck, including the sawed-off shotgun sale not mentioned in the in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>dictment. Because he brokered the sale of a sawed-off shotgun, the PSI determined Jackson\u2019s base offense level under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(l)(ii), which provides for a level 26 \u201cif ... the offense involved\u201d a gun defined in 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 5845(a), including a sawed-off shotgun. At sentencing, Jackson objected to the use of \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(l)(ii) to set his base offense level because the sawed-off shotgun deal was not charged in the indictment. According to Jackson, his base offense level should have been 20, which would have yielded a guidelines range of 70 to 87 months\u2019 imprisonment. The district court overruled his objection and determined his guidelines range was 130 to 162 months\u2019 imprisonment. Under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(a)(2), however, Jackson faced a statutory maximum of 120 months\u2019 imprisonment. This became his guidelines range and, ultimately, his sentence. After sentencing, Jackson appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-5\">We review questions of law arising under the guidelines <em>de novo. United States v. Williams, </em>431 F.3d 767, 769 (11th Cir. 2005). The base offense level for a \u00a7 922(g) crime is 26 if \u201cthe offense involved\u201d a sawed-off shotgun. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(l)(ii); <em>see </em>26 U.S.C. \u00a7 5845(a). Guidelines commentary defines \u201coffense\u201d as \u201cthe offense of conviction <em>and all relevant conduct </em>under \u00a7 IB 1.3 unless a different meaning is specified or is otherwise clear from the context.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.1, cmt. (n. 1(H)) (emphasis added). Further, \u201c[ujnless otherwise specified,\u201d a defendant\u2019s base offense level should account for \u201call acts and omissions committed, aided, abetted, counseled, commanded, induced, procured, or willfully caused by the defendant. <em>...\u201d Id. </em>\u00a7 lB1.3(a)(l)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b685-6\">Jackson contends that \u00a7 2K2.1(a) \u201cotherwise specified]\u201d the conduct on which his base offense level should be calculated. <em>Id. </em>He argues this conduct should be restricted to that charged in the indictment, which did not include the shotgun, arguing that section\u2019s use of the restrictive term \u201cthe\u201d qualifies the word \u201coffense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 2K2.1(a). We do not agree. The guidelines commentary defines \u201coffense\u201d as \u201cthe offense of conviction\u201d as well as \u201call relevant conduct....\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1B1.1, cmt. (n. 1(H)). If the Sentencing Commission intended \u00a7 2K2.1(a) to be limited to the offense of conviction, it would have used that language, rather than the more general term \u201coffense.\u201d Because a more limited definition of offense is not \u201cspecified\u201d in \u00a7 2K2.1(a), the district court correctly concluded that Jackson\u2019s base offense level should be determined based on \u201cthe offense of conviction and all relevant conduct. ...\u201d <em>Id. </em>And Jackson does not argue his brokerage of the shotgun was not relevant conduct. The district court was therefore correct in setting Jackson\u2019s base offense level at 26.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
