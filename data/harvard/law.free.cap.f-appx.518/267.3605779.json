The district court dismissed Bownes\u2019s \u00a7 1983 claim as frivolous and for failure to state a claim and imposed a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g) strike for the dismissal. The district court dismissed Bownes\u2019s \u00a7 2254 claim without prejudice. <em>See Serio v. Members of La. St. Bd. of Pardons, </em>821 F.2d 1112, 1119 (5th Cir.1987); <em>Preiser v. Rodriguez, </em>411 U.S. 475, 494, 499-500, 93 S.Ct. 1827, 36 L.Ed.2d 439 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b293-19\">As an initial matter, Bownes\u2019s motions to file supplemental authorities are granted. His motion for appointment of counsel is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-20\">Although the district court did not rule upon whether a certificate of appealability was warranted, <em>see </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(1)(A), we will not reach this jurisdictional issue due to the frivolous nature of Bownes\u2019s appeal. <em>Cf. United States v. Alvarez, </em>210 F.3d 309, 310 (5th Cir.2000). Bownes has abandoned by failing to challenge the district court\u2019s dismissal of his \u00a7 1983 claims and the denial of habeas relief. <em>See Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 225 (5th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b293-21\">Bownes\u2019s appeal is without arguable merit and thus is frivolous. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 219-20 (5th Cir.1983). Because the appeal is frivolous, it is dismissed. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2. The dismissal of this appeal as frivolous counts as a strike under \u00a7 1915(g), as does the district court\u2019s dismissal of the complaint. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1915(g); <em>Patton v. Jefferson Correctional Center, </em>136 F.3d 458, 463-64 (5th <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>Cir.1998); <em>Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 387-88 (5th Cir.1996). Bownes is warned that if he accumulates three strikes, he may not proceed IFP in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b294-4\">MOTION TO FILE SUPPLEMENTAL AUTHORITIES GRANTED; MOTION FOR APPOINTMENT OF COUNSEL DENIED; APPEAL DISMISSED; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b293-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
