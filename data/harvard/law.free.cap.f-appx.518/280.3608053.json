For the first time on appeal, he argues that his offense level was improperly enhanced under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(i) based on his prior federal conviction under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846 for conspiracy to possess cocaine with intent to distribute. He maintains that because a conspiracy conviction under \u00a7 846 does not require any overt act, it is not a conspiracy within the generic, contemporary meaning of the word, and it therefore cannot support the enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-7\">We review Garcia-Lopez\u2019s arguments only for plain error. <em>See United States v. Rodriguez-Escareno, </em>700 F.3d 751, 753 (5th Cir.2012). Garcia-Lopez\u2019s arguments are foreclosed by this court\u2019s recent decision in <em>Rodriguez-Escareno, </em>where we considered the question whether a prior conviction under \u00a7 846 could be used to enhance a sentence for illegal reentry under \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(i). 700 F.3d at 753. In that case, this court considered the language of the Guidelines and the relevant Application Notes and held that \u201cthe Guidelines themselves, reasonably interpreted, provide that\u201d the \u201cfederal crime of conspiring to commit\u201d a drug offense \u201cwill qualify for the enhancement.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 754. Thus, there is \u201cno reason to search outside the Guidelines for a definition of \u2018conspiracy\u2019 applicable to this enhancement.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 754. Accordingly, the district court did not err in applying the enhancement. <em>Id. </em>at 754-55.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b307-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
