Romero asserts several issues on appeal, which we address in turn. We affirm Romero\u2019s convictions and sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-19\">\n<em>Sufficiency of the Evidence</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b675-20\">Romero first contends there was insufficient evidence for the jury to convict him of each of the four counts. Romero asserts the evidence at trial was insufficient to establish that he participated in a conspiracy because it did not show that he joined in any criminal activity. He further <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number>argues he cannot be liable for possession of stolen property, even under an aiding and abetting theory, because he never took any action with respect to the stolen goods or asserted a right to possession to them. He argues he did not aid or abet the theft of cargo, because the theft was completed before Romero ever learned of it. Romero asserts he did not give any false information about the crimes and was not required to disclose any additional information to warrant a conviction for obstruction of justice. Viewed in the light most favorable to the Government, the evidence at trial supports Romero\u2019s convictions as to each count in the indictment.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Count 1\u2014Conspiracy</em></p>\n<p id=\"b676-3\">With respect to the conspiracy conviction, there is sufficient circumstantial evidence to support the conviction. <em>See United States v. Arias-Izquierdo, </em>449 F.3d 1168, 1182 (11th Cir.2006) (\u201cThe government is ... not required to demonstrate the existence of a \u2018formal agreement,\u2019 but may instead demonstrate by circumstantial evidence a meeting of the minds to commit an unlawful act.\u201d). Romero was present at the warehouses on the day the tractor trailer arrived at the warehouses and the pallets were unloaded, and during the time that co-conspirators were moving boxes of stolen laptops from one warehouse to another. Further, Romero helped push two cars out of the way, and had to move his own SUV, so that a box truck could be loaded. Boxes containing the stolen computers were visible from where Romero was standing. Testimony supported that Romero told his co-conspirators that he had seen the computers and asked if a co-conspirator was getting something out of the deal. Romero also told a co-conspirator that he was interested in acquiring one of the stolen computers. Finally, there was evidence that a co-conspirator asked Romero to go to his warehouse when the warehouse was full of stolen computers to pick up a pallet jack and return it.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-6\">From the evidence of Romero\u2019s presence at critical times, and knowledge of the stolen computers, the jury could reasonably have inferred that Romero was a co-conspirator. <em>See United States v. Cruz-Valdez, </em>773 F.2d 1541, 1547 (11th Cir.1985) (\u201ca prudent smuggler is not likely to suffer the presence of unaffiliated bystanders\u201d). Although Romero seeks to distinguish <em>Cruz-Valdez </em>on the basis that, because he was assigned to patrol the warehouse area, the conspirators had to tolerate his presence, he offers no explanation for why a co-conspirator would have permitted him to retrieve the pallet jack from his warehouse while it was still full of stolen computers. Nor has he otherwise borne his burden of explaining why the jury could not have inferred that he knowingly joined the conspiracy.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-7\">There was also evidence of Romero\u2019s active participation in the conspiracy. Evidence of his role included testimony that a co-conspirator \u201chad the Hialeah Gardens Police Department under control.\u201d In addition, there was evidence that, moments after hearing a detective announce that he was going to investigate a tip about the sale of stolen laptop computers from the warehouse, Romero left the roll call room and placed a call to a co-conspirator. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>There was also evidence that Romero tipped off his co-conspirators to a possible raid, allowing a co-conspirator to remove evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-5\">The evidence was sufficient to show a conspiracy existed, Romero was aware of the conspiracy, and he knowingly joined the conspiracy by committing acts which furthered the crime by helping to protect the other participants from apprehension by the police.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>See United States v. Garcia-Bercovich, </em>582 F.3d 1234, 1237 (11th Cir.2009) (listing the elements of conspiracy).</p>\n<p id=\"b677-6\"><em>Counts 2 and 3 </em>\u2014 Cargo <em>Theft and Possession of Stolen Goods</em></p>\n<p id=\"b677-7\">With respect to his convictions for cargo theft and possession of stolen goods, Romero argues there was no evidence he took any action \u201cto receive, possess, conceal, store, sell, or dispose of the stolen goods.\u201d There was, however, sufficient evidence to sustain a conviction for both offenses on an aiding and abetting theory, because the Government proved that the substantive offenses were committed, and that Romero associated himself with the criminal venture and committed acts which furthered the crimes. <em>See United States v. Hamblin, </em>911 F.2d 551, 557 (11th Cir.1990) (explaining that to prove aiding and abetting, under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2, the government must demonstrate a substantive offense was committed, the defendant associated himself with the criminal venture, and he committed some act which furthered the crime).</p>\n<p id=\"b677-10\"><em>Count U </em>\u2014 Obstruction <em>of Justice</em></p>\n<p id=\"b677-11\">The evidence was also sufficient for Romero\u2019s conviction for obstruction of justice. The evidence demonstrated that Romero was guilty of both \u201cknowingly making a false statement,\u201d and \u201cintentionally omitting information from a statement and thereby causing a portion of such statement to be misleading, or intentionally concealing a material fact, and thereby creating a false impression by such statement.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1515(a)(3)(A) and (B). Romero knowingly made a false statement when he was dispatched to one of the warehouses to investigate a burglar alarm, and reported that \u201ceverything was fine.\u201d A jury could infer that Romero\u2019s actions were intended to keep the police from knowing that his co-conspirator had just set off the motion detector by entering a window, which Romero had promised to leave unlocked, in order to remove a DVR and incriminating evidence that it contained about the stolen laptops in the warehouses. Further, Romero intentionally omitted the facts that he knew co-conspirators, that he had returned a pallet jack for one of his co-conspirators, or that Romero had been at the warehouses over the weekend at issue. Romero further concealed the fact that a co-conspirator requested he contact his brother and remove the DVR from his warehouse to destroy any incriminating evidence. Rome<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>ro\u2019s argument that obstruction does not cover omissions, is refuted by the statutory definition of \u201cmisleading conduct,\u201d which specifically includes omissions and concealment. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1515(a)(3)(B). Based on the evidence that Romero knowingly made false statements and intentionally omitted and concealed other information, the jury could reasonably conclude that Romero engaged in \u201cmisleading conduct\u201d as required for conviction under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1512(b)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b678-4\">\n<em>Minor-role reduction</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AV3\">Romero further argues that the district court erred in denying his request for a two-level reduction in the base offense level for being a minor participant in the offense, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B 1.2(b),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> because his supposed participation in the conspiracy did nothing to further the criminal enterprise. Although Romero argues that he was a \u201ccomparative outsider to the scheme,\u201d he fails to demonstrate clear error in the district court\u2019s factual finding that his role \u201cwas key and pivotal to the success of this conspiracy.\u201d <em>See United States v. De Varon, </em>175 F.3d 930, 937 (11th Cir.1999) (en banc) (determination of a defendant\u2019s role in an offense constitutes a factual finding to be reviewed only for clear error). Romero played a unique role in the conspiracy by tipping off co-conspirators, and making it possible for them to destroy evidence. Romero also facilitated the removal of the DVR from a warehouse, and provided the co-conspirators with inside information about the criminal investigation. Because it is not clear that Romero \u201cplayed a relatively minor role\u201d in the conduct for which he was held accountable, we affirm. <em>See id. </em>at 944 (stating \u201c[o]nly if the defendant can establish that [he] played a relatively minor role in the conduct for which [he] has already been held accountable \u2014 not a minor role in any larger criminal conspiracy \u2014 should the district court grant a downward adjustment for minor role in the offense.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b678-7\">\n<em>Abuse of Trust</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b678-8\">Finally, Romero asserts that the district court erred in overruling his objection to the two-level enhancement for abuse of a position of trust, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.3,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> because his contribution to the crimes was insignificant. The district court did not err in applying the abuse of trust enhancement. <em>See United States v. Terry, </em>60 F.3d 1541, 1545 (\u201cThe district court\u2019s finding that [the defendant] abused a position of public trust in a manner that significantly facilitated his ability to commit or conceal the offense is reviewed under a clearly erroneous standard,\u201d but \u201cwhether the defendant\u2019s conduct justifies the \u2018abuse of trust\u2019 enhancement is a question of law reviewed de novo.\u201d). In <em>Terry, </em>the Government presented evidence that a deputy sheriff used his office and patrol car to prevent police interception of his co-conspirator\u2019s drug sales to an undercover agent. This Court held that \u201cby being at the scene in his patrol car and by monitoring ... police traffic [to] ensure that no other officers interrupted the transaction,\u201d the deputy sheriff \u201cfacilitated both the commission and concealment of the crime.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b678-9\">In light of the court\u2019s finding, with regard to Romero\u2019s request for a minor-role <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>reduction, that Romero played a \u201ckey and pivotal\u201d role in the conspiracy, this argument has no traction. Like the defendant in <em>Terry, </em>Romero used his position as a police officer to help conceal a crime. Nothing in <em>Terry, </em>suggests that concealment alone renders the enhancement inapplicable. Romero\u2019s conduct warranted the abuse of trust enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-5\">\n<em>Conclusion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b679-6\">Viewed in the light most favorable to the Government, there was sufficient evidence at trial to support the jury\u2019s verdicts against Romero as to each count. Moreover, the district court did not clearly err in denying Romero a minor role reduction or in imposing an abuse of trust enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b676-4\">. We review <em>de novo </em>whether there is sufficient evidence to support a jury\u2019s verdict in a criminal trial, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the government and resolving all reasonable inferences and credibility evaluations in favor of the verdict. <em>United States v. Doe, </em>661 F.3d 550, 560 (11th Cir.2011), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 132 S.Ct. 1648, 182 L.Ed.2d 242 (2012). Where the government relies on circumstantial evidence, reasonable inferences, and not mere speculation, must support the jury's verdict. <em>Id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b677-8\">. Romero's post-arrest statement and trial testimony also supported his conspiracy conviction. Romero\u2019s post-arrest statement was false in several ways \u2014 for example, Romero initially lied about his discussion with a co-conspirator in the back of the police car, and denied making any phone calls or sending any text messages to any of the other co-conspirators, from which the jury could reasonably infer a consciousness of guilt. See <em>United States v. Jernigan, </em>341 F.3d 1273, 1279 (11th Cir.2003) (stating a jury may infer guilty knowledge from defendant\u2019s false statement to arresting officer). Moreover, it was permissible for the jury to reject Romero\u2019s testimony at trial \u2014 that he did not know there were stolen computers in the warehouses, that he took no part in any efforts to remove the DVR from one warehouse, and the reason he called one of his co-conspirators after roll call was to discuss having coffee \u2014 and conclude the opposite of his testimony was true. <em>See United States v. Jiminez, </em>564 F.3d 1280, 1285 (11th Cir.2009).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b678-5\">.
