In her complaint, Driessen alleged that the defendants, which also included the U.S. Department of Education, had failed to provide a free and appropriate public education to one of her daughters, and that they had denied her access to her children\u2019s education records.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-6\">Prior to bringing this action, a Florida circuit court adjudicated Driessen\u2019s father the children\u2019s permanent legal guardian, with the express right to make all educational decisions for the children. In light of this decision, the District Court dismissed Driessen\u2019s complaint on the grounds that she lacked standing to prosecute it: (1) as a non-eustodial parent without the authority to make educational decisions for her children, she could not bring the claims on behalf of herself; and (2) she could not bring the claims on behalf of her children.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-7\">In her brief on appeal, Driessen argues, among other things, that the District Court failed to entertain on the merits her claim that the defendants failed to comply with the procedural requirements of the IDEA; since the court had jurisdiction under the IDEA and the Rehabilitation Act, it should have decided her claim. Her brief fails, however, to address the District Court\u2019s dismissal of her complaint on the two grounds indicated above. Though we normally would treat as abandoned any argument she could make regarding those grounds, <em>see Timson v. Sampson, </em>518 F.3d 870, 874 (11th Cir. 2008) (holding that a <em>pro se </em>plaintiff abandons any issues not raised on appeal), given her <em>pro se </em>status, we address them.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-9\">We review <em>de novo </em>the dismissal of a case for lack of standing. <em>Stalley ex rel. United States v. Orlando Reg\u2019l Healthcare Sys., </em>524 F.3d 1229, 1232 (11th Cir.2008). Under the IDEA, \u201c[a]ny party aggrieved by the findings and decision made under subsection (f) or (k) who does not have the right to an appeal under subsection (g), and any party aggrieved by the findings and decision made under this subsection, shall have the right to bring a civil action. ...\u201d 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415(i)(2)(A). Subsection (f) requires that \u201cthe parents or the local educational agency\u201d involved in a due-process complaint have the opportunity for an impartial due-process hearing. 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415(f)(1)(A). Subsection (k) provides that the \u201cparent of a child with a disability who disagrees with any decision regarding placement, or the manifestation determination under this subsection, ... may request a hearing.\u201d 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415(k)(3)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b837-10\">Regulations promulgated by the DOE define a parent, <em>inter alia, </em>as a \u201cguardian generally authorized to act as the child\u2019s parent, or authorized to make educational decisions for the child.\u201d 34 C.F.R. \u00a7 300.30(a)(3). Moreover, if a judicial decree identifies a specific person to act as the parent of a child \u201cor to make educational decisions on behalf of a child, then such person or persons shall be determined to be the \u2018parent.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 300.30(b)(2). Under Florida law, the term \u201cparent\u201d does not include \u201can individual whose parental relationship to the child has been legally terminated.\u201d Fla. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 39.01(49). Florida law also pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"812\">*812</page-number>vides that the phrase \u201c[p]ermanent guardianship of a dependent child\u201d indicates that the court has transferred the parental rights \u201cwith respect to the child relating to protection, education, care and control of the person, custody of the person, and decisionmaking on behalf of the child.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 39.01(55).</p>\n<p id=\"b838-4\">Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1654, parties in federal courts are permitted to \u201cplead and conduct their own cases personally or by counsel.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1654. Nevertheless, a parent may not bring a <em>pro se </em>action in federal court on behalf of a child who was denied relief in an administrative hearing held under the IDEA. <em>Devine v. Indian River Cnty. Sch. Bd., </em>121 F.3d 576, 581-82 (11th Cir.1997), <em>overruled in part on other grounds by Winkelman ex rel. Winkelman v. Parma City Sch. Dist., </em>550 U.S. 516, 535, 127 S.Ct. 1994, 2006-07, 167 L.Ed.2d 904 (2007) (holding that parents have separately enforceable rights under the IDEA and, thus, declining to reach the question of whether parents may litigate their children\u2019s claims <em>pro </em>se).</p>\n<p id=\"b838-5\">The District Court properly dismissed Driessen\u2019s complaint because, at the time she filed it, she was not a \u201cparent\u201d under federal law and thus did not have the authority to make educational decisions on behalf of her children under state law. In short, she lacked standing to bring this lawsuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
