Holley, a Florida prisoner proceeding pro se, appeals the district court\u2019s denial of his petition for a writ of habeas corpus, filed pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254. Holley argues that the Florida court\u2019s adjudication of his claim \u2014 that he did not knowingly and voluntarily waive his Sixth Amendment right to assistance of counsel' \u2014 was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established federal law. Upon careful review of the record and consideration of the parties\u2019 briefs, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-15\">Holley was indicted for possessing and selling cocaine in four separate cases, three of which were the subject of hearings on April 21, 2003. The Florida trial judge conducted a detailed Faretta<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> inquiry upon a request by Holley to represent himself in one of those cases, but did not repeat the inquiry for the case which is the subject of the present petition. Although pretrial matters for the cases were handled together, and Holley was otherwise made aware of the benefits of counsel and the disadvantages of proceeding pro se, he contends on this appeal that his waiver of his right to counsel in the related case is not transferrable to this one. He asserts that he never affirmatively waived his right to counsel in this case, and any al<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"859\">*859</page-number>leged waiver was unknowing because the court failed to conduct another <em>Faretta </em>inquiry before allowing him to proceed pro se.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-5\">The district court denied Holley\u2019s petition, and found it clear that the judge and the parties were operating under the assumption that the <em>Faretta </em>inquiry in one case was applicable to the others, and that Holley\u2019s waiver of counsel in the present case was knowing, voluntary, and intelligent.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-6\">We review de novo the district court\u2019s determination that the standard for granting a \u00a7 2254 petition has not been met. <em>Van Poyck v. Florida Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>290 F.3d 1318, 1321 (11th Cir.2002) (per curiam). Under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996, Pub. L.No. 104-132, 110 Stat. 1214, (AEDPA), federal courts cannot grant federal habeas relief unless the state court\u2019s decision was (1) contrary to, or an unreasonable application of, clearly established federal law as defined by Supreme Court precedent or (2) based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b885-9\">The Sixth Amendment guarantees criminal defendants the assistance of counsel during all critical stages of the criminal justice process. <em>Iowa v. Tovar, </em>541 U.S. 77, 80-81, 124 S.Ct. 1379, 1383, 158 L.Ed.2d 209 (2004). The Constitution guarantees a defendant the right to conduct his own defense. <em>Faretta, </em>422 U.S. at 836, 95 S.Ct. at 2541. But, in order to do so, he must \u201cknowingly and intelligently\u201d waive his right to counsel. <em>Id. </em>at 835, 95 S.Ct. at 2541.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-10\">The Supreme Court has described a waiver of counsel as knowing and voluntary when the defendant \u201cknows what he is doing and his choice is made with eyes open.\u201d <em>Tovar, </em>541 U.S. at 88, 124 S.Ct. at 1387 (internal quotation marks omitted). The Supreme Court has not, however, \u201cprescribed any formula or script to be read to a defendant who states that he elects to proceed without counsel.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Thus, \u201cthe failure to provide on-the-record warnings does not always lead to reversal,\u201d because \u201cthe ultimate test of whether a defendant\u2019s choice is knowing is not the adequacy of the trial court\u2019s warning but the defendant\u2019s understanding.\u201d <em>Jones v. Walker, </em>540 F.3d 1277, 1293 (11th Cir. 2008) (en banc) (internal quotation marks omitted). The information a defendant must possess to make a knowing and intelligent waiver \u201cwill depend on a range of case-specific factors.\u201d <em>Tovar, </em>541 U.S. at 88, 124 S.Ct. at 1387. However, the \u201ccore inquiry is whether the defendant understood the choices before him\u201d and the risks of self-representation. <em>Jones, </em>540 F.3d at 1293. Moreover, \u201cit is irrelevant for constitutional purposes whether his understanding comes from a colloquy with the trial court, a conversation with his counsel, or his own research or experience.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b885-12\">Holley has not shown that he did not knowingly and voluntarily waive his right to assistance of counsel, and therefore, the Florida court\u2019s adjudication of his claim was not contrary to, or an unreasonable application of, federal law as determined by the Supreme Court. We agree with the district court that while it would have been preferable for the Florida court to have conducted a separate <em>Faretta </em>inquiry before permitting Holley to represent himself, the failure to do so does not rise to the level of a federal constitutional violation. Holley made it abundantly clear that he desired to represent himself, and he rejected the offer of appointed counsel on numerous occasions. Holley was made aware of the nature of the charges and the possible penalties, the benefits of proceeding with counsel, and the disadvantages of proceeding pro se through his discussions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"860\">*860</page-number>with the court and his counsel, his prior experience in criminal proceedings, and the <em>Faretta </em>hearing that was conducted in the related case in which Holley represented himself. Therefore, Holley made the choice to represent himself \u201cwith eyes open.\u201d <em>See Tovar, </em>541 U.S. at 88, 124 S.Ct. at 1387 (internal quotation marks omitted). We also note that Holley had the benefit of two public defenders as stand-by counsel at his trial. Accordingly, the district court did not err in denying him habeas relief, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b884-9\">. <em>Faretta v.
