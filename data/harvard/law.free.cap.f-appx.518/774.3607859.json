Smith argues that his prior conviction in a Florida court for fleeing and eluding a police officer, Fla. Stat. \u00a7 316.1935(2), did not qualify as a violent felony under the Act. Smith also argues, for the first time, that the district court violated his rights under the Fifth and Sixth Amendments by sentencing him as an armed career criminal based on prior convictions that were neither charged in his indictment nor admitted by him. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-17\">The district court did not err in classifying Smith\u2019s prior conviction as a violent felony. Smith\u2019s presentence investigation report classified as a violent felony his prior conviction for \u201cwillfully flee[ing] or attempting] to elude a law enforcement officer in an authorized [and marked] law enforcement patrol vehicle[ ] ... with [its] siren and lights activated.\u201d Fla. Stat. \u00a7 316.1935(2). After Smith objected to the classification, the government acknowledged that a person could violate the statute by pedestrian flight, but argued that certified copies of Smith\u2019s judgment of conviction and charging document proved that he fled using a vehicle. Those documents established that Smith entered a plea of guilty to an information charging that he, \u201cas an operator of a motor vehicle, did unlawfully and willfully flee or attempt to elude a law enforcement officer ... in violation of [\u00a7 ] 316.1935(2).\u201d And the district court correctly relied on the certified documents to determine the nature of Smith\u2019s offense. <em>See Shepard v. United States, </em>544 U.S. 13, 26, 125 S.Ct. 1254, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"776\">*776</page-number>1263, 161 L.Ed.2d 205 (2005); <em>United States v. Gandy, </em>710 F.3d 1234, 1237 (11th Cir.2013). While Smith\u2019s case was pending on appeal, we held in <em>United States v. Petite, </em>703 F.3d 1290 (11th Cir.2013), that a \u201cprior conviction for vehicle flight in violation of Fla. Stat. \u00a7 316.1935(2) qualifies as a violent felony under the Armed Career Criminal Act.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1301. Under <em>Petite, </em>the district court did not err in treating Smith\u2019s prior conviction as a predicate offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-4\">The district court also did not err, much less plainly err, in enhancing Smith\u2019s sentence based on his prior convictions. Smith acknowledges that his argument about the violation of his constitutional rights is foreclosed by the decision of the Supreme Court in <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). \u201c[W]e are bound by <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>until it is explicitly overruled by the Supreme Court.\u201d <em>United States v. Dowd, </em>451 F.3d 1244, 1253 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b802-5\">We AFFIRM Smith\u2019s sentence.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
