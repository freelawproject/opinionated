Dale, Dale Law Firm, PA, Orlando, FL, for Defendant-Appellant.</attorneys>\n<judges data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b907-6\">Before TJOFLAT, CARNES and BARKETT, Circuit Judges.</judges>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b907-7\">PER CURIAM:</author>\n<p id=\"b907-8\">On December 9, 2011, the District Court sentenced Thomas Beasley to a prison term of 140 months after he plead guilty pursuant to a plea agreement to possession of a firearm by a convicted felon, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 922(g)(1) and 924(e). In sentencing Beasley, the court granted the Government\u2019s substantial assistance motion pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1 and reduced his offense level by one level.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-9\">Beasley\u2019s plea agreement contains a sentence appeal waiver. Notwithstanding the waiver, Beasley appeals his sentence, arguing that (1) the court erred in failing to consider, apply, and explain the \u00a7 5K1.1 factors, and (2) the Government breached the plea agreement by failing to properly apprise the court of his substantial assistance. The Government, responding, contends that Beasley\u2019s appeal is barred by the appeal waiver.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-10\">We review the validity of a sentence appeal waiver <em>de novo. United States v. Johnson, </em>541 F.3d 1064, 1066 (11th Cir.2008). A sentence appeal waiver will be enforced if it was made knowingly and voluntarily. <em>United States v. Bushert, </em>997 F.2d 1343, 1351 (11th Cir.1993). To establish that the waiver was made knowingly and voluntarily, the Government must show either that (1) the court specifically questioned the defendant about the waiver during the plea colloquy, or (2) the record makes clear that the defendant otherwise understood the full significance of the waiver. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b907-12\">Here, it is clear from the plea agreement and the plea colloquy that Beasley knowingly and voluntarily waived his right to appeal his sentence. During the plea colloquy, the court specifically informed him of the presence of the appeal waiver and verified that he understood it. <em>See Bushert, </em>997 F.2d at 1351. Moreover, even if the court\u2019s questions regarding the sentence appeal waiver were insufficiently specific, he signed the overall plea agreement and initialed the page containing the waiver. This, combined with his responses during the plea colloquy, make it manifestly clear that Beasley understood the full significance of the waiver. <em>See id. </em>No exception to Beasley\u2019s appeal waiver applies, nor does Beasley contend that it does. Accordingly, we dismiss this portion of Beasley\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-13\">An appeal waiver does not foreclose a defendant\u2019s appeal that the government breached the plea agreement at sentencing. <em>See United States v. Copeland, </em>381 F.3d 1101, 1104-05 (11th Cir.2004) (holding that defendant retained right to appeal breach of plea agreement where appeal waiver stated that \u201cthe defendant knowingly waives the right to appeal any sentence imposed in the instant case.... \u201d). Here, Beasley failed to inform the District Court at sentencing that the Government was breaching the plea agreement in not fully advising the court of his substantial assistance; hence, we review this claim for plain error. <em>See United States v. Nash, </em>438 F.3d 1302, 1304 (11th Cir.2006) (holding that, where the defendant fails to object in the district court, this court reverses only for plain error). To establish plain error, a defendant must show there is (1) error, (2) that is plain, and (3) that affects substantial rights. <em>United States v. Moriarty, </em>429 F.3d 1012, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"882\">*882</page-number>1019 (11th Cir.2005). If all three conditions are met, we may exercise our discretion to correct the error if it seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings. <em>Id. </em>The government violates a written plea agreement when its conduct is inconsistent with the agreement\u2019s terms that reasonably were understood by the defendant when entering the guilty plea. <em>United States v. Nelson, </em>887 F.2d 1519, 1521-22 (11th Cir. 1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b908-4\">We find no error here, much less plain error. Beasley cites no binding precedent, and we find none, that would have put the District Court on notice that, in moving the court to reduce Beasley\u2019s offense level pursuant to \u00a7 5K1.1, the Government was breaching the plea agreement and that the court had a duty to intervene <em>sua sponte </em>and derail the breach.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-5\">In sum, pursuant to the appeal waiver, we dismiss the appeal of the court\u2019s purported failure to properly consider, explain and apply the \u00a7 5K1.1 factors. As for Beasley\u2019s argument that the Government breached the plea agreement, we find no merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-6\">DISMISSED, in part; AFFIRMED, in part.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
