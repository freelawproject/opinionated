On appeal, Ferrer argues that (1) the district court clearly erred in applying a four-level sentencing enhancement for his leadership role in the marijuana conspiracy, and (2) his sentences are substantively unreasonable. After review of the record and consideration of the parties\u2019 briefs, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-14\">\n<em>Aggravating Role Enhancement</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b744-15\">Ferrer contends that the district court erred by imposing a four-level enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3Bl.l(a) based on the court\u2019s finding that he was an organizer or leader of the drug conspiracy. Instead, he should have received only a three-level enhancement under \u00a7 3Bl.l(b) for being a manager or supervisor because he was not entitled to a greater share of the profits or the fruit of the enterprise, as he did not finance any of the grow house operations. Ferrer also maintains he did not exercise authority over the operation or other individuals involved in the conspiracy.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-16\">The district court did not clearly error in assessing Ferrer a four-level leadership role enhancement. <em>See United States v. Caraballo, </em>595 F.3d 1214, 1231 (11th Cir.2010). The Guidelines commentary enumerates seven factors for the dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"719\">*719</page-number>trict court\u2019s consideration in differentiating a leadership role from that of a mere supervisor, including \u201cthe claimed right to a larger share of the fruits of the crime,\u201d and \u201cthe degree of control and authority exercised over others.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.1, comment, (n.4). Ferrer\u2019s argument mistakenly hinges on the alleged absence of these two factors. \u201cThere is no requirement that all of the considerations have to be present in any one case,\u201d <em>Caraballo, </em>595 F.3d at 1231 (quotation omitted), and the record before the district court amply supported the court\u2019s finding that Ferrer was a leader or organizer of the conspiracy. At his brother\u2019s trial, Ferrer testified that he set up and ran a marijuana grow house in Savannah, Georgia, was responsible for expanding the operation to a second house in Guyton, Georgia, and was the one who \u201cma[de] the rules.\u201d Ferrer also referred to the alleged actual leader of the conspiracy, Mike Maleh, as his \u201cpartner.\u201d <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.1, comment, (n.4) (\u201cThere can, of course, be more than one person who qualifies as a leader or organizer of a criminal association or conspiracy.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b745-5\">The record further demonstrates that Ferrer was responsible for bringing others into the operation, directing the distribution of marijuana, and was involved in over 1,000 drug-related phone calls and text messages during the course of the conspiracy. <em>See Caraballo, </em>595 F.3d at 1232 (noting that the application of a leadership role enhancement was supported, in part, by evidence the defendant placed 97 phone calls during an alien smuggling operation). On this record, we cannot say the district court clearly erred in apply the leadership role enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-6\">\n<em>Substantive Reasonableness</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b745-7\">Ferrer argues his sentences are substantively unreasonable because the district court did not give him sufficient credit for his substantial assistance to the Government when departing below the Guidelines pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-11\">Contrary to his arguments, Ferrer\u2019s 60-month sentences were substantively reasonable.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The district court explained that, but for the Government\u2019s \u00a7 5K1.1 motion, the court would have sentenced Ferrer to 78 months\u2019 imprisonment based on his prior history and willing participation in a large scale marijuana operation. The court also explained that it had considered the parties\u2019 arguments as well as the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. Given the scope of the conspiracy, Ferrer\u2019s central role in the operation, his criminal history, and the district court\u2019s articulated reasons for the sentences, we are not left \u201cwith the definite and firm conviction that the district court committed a clear error of judgment in weighing the \u00a7 3553(a) factors\u201d or that it \u201carrived at a sentence that lay outside the range of reasonable sentences dictated by the facts of the case.\u201d <em>United States v. Gibson, </em>708 F.3d 1256, 1275 (11th Cir. 2013) (quotations and brackets omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b745-12\">Accordingly, Ferrer\u2019s sentences are AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b745-8\">. We review the district court\u2019s departure outside the Guidelines range for reasonableness \"in light of the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors and the reasons stated by the district court for departing.\u201d <em>United States v. Martin, </em>455 F.3d 1227, 1236 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
