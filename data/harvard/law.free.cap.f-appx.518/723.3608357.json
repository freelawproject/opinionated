He appeals both sentences, arguing that the sentences are unreasonable because the court failed to adequately consider his argument for leniency and the sentencing factors of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3558(a), and did not explain its reasons for the sentences. He also argues that the criminal history calculation used to determine the advisory guideline sentence range for the 2012 conviction took his 2011 conviction into consideration twice, once for the conviction itself and again, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4Al.l(d), for committing the 2012 offense while on supervised release from the conviction. Due to this \u201cdouble counting,\u201d he should have received a lower, non-consecutive sentence. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-5\">We review the reasonableness of a sentence under a deferential abuse of discretion standard. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 41, 128 S.Ct. 586, 591, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007); <em>see also United States v. Sweeting, </em>437 F.3d 1105, 1106 (11th Cir. 2006) (holding that a sentence imposed upon revocation of supervised release is reviewed for reasonableness). We consider whether the sentence was procedurally unreasonable due to an error of the district court, such as failure to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors or to adequately explain the chosen sentence. <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. at 597. While 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(c) requires the court to state its reasons for the sentence in open court, the court is not required to articulate its consideration of every \u00a7 3553(a) factor, especially where it is obvious that the court considered many of the factors. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(c); <em>see United States v. Bonilla, </em>463 F.3d 1176, 1182 (11th Cir.2006). The court must state enough to show that it considered the parties\u2019 arguments and had a reasoned basis for imposing the sentence. <em>Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 356, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2468, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b751-7\">We disturb a sentence as substantively unreasonable only if \u201cleft with the definite and firm conviction that the district court committed a clear error of judgment in weighing the \u00a7 3553(a) factors by arriving at a sentence that lies outside the range of reasonable sentences dictated by the facts of the case.\u201d <em>United States v. Irey, </em>612 F.3d 1160, 1190 (11th Cir.2010) <em>(en </em>banc), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 131 S.Ct. 1813, 179 L.Ed.2d 772 (2011) (quotation omitted). The court commits a clear error of judgment when it imposes a sentence that does not achieve the sentencing goals of \u00a7 3553(a), which include reflecting the seriousness of the offense, promoting respect for the law, providing just punishment, and deterring criminal conduct. <em>Id. </em>at 1189; 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A), (B).</p>\n<p id=\"b751-10\">The court has discretion to impose a sentence upon revocation of supervised release consecutively to other sentences being served by the defendant. <em>See United States v. Quinones, </em>136 F.3d 1293,1294-95 (11th Cir.1998) (holding that 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3584(a), which permits the court to impose consecutive terms of imprisonment, applies to revocation sentences); <em>see also United States v. Hofierka, </em>83 F.3d 357, 360-62 (11th Cir.1996) (explaining that the policy statements of Chapter Seven of the Sentencing Guidelines were never intended to be binding). In order to decide whether to impose consecutive or concurrent sentences, the court must consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3584(b). The Sentencing Guidelines recommend that any sentence imposed upon revocation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"726\">*726</page-number>of supervised release \u201cbe ordered to be served consecutively to any sentence of imprisonment that the defendant is serving.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 7B1.3(f).</p>\n<p id=\"b752-4\">Monrroy\u2019s consecutive sentences are reasonable. The court considered the arguments of the parties and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, and articulated its reasoning for the sentence. <em>See Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. at 597; <em>Rita, </em>551 U.S. at 356, 127 S.Ct. at 2468. The record indicates that the sentences were based on Monrroy\u2019s history of repeated illegal re-entry into the United States and his disregard of the court\u2019s prior warning that he would receive severe punishment if he returned. Moreover, the sentences reflected the seriousness of the offense and provided just punishment in light of the fact that Monrroy had been deported and re-entered the United States on five prior occasions. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A); <em>Irey, </em>612 F.3d at 1189. Monrroy\u2019s history led to court to impose sentences at the high end of the guideline ranges to promote his respect for the law and to adequately, deter his future criminal conduct. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A), (B).</p>\n<p id=\"b752-5\">Further, the court did not abuse its discretion by imposing the sentences consecutively, because it adequately considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and followed the recommendation of the Sentencing Guidelines. <em>See Quinones, </em>136 F.3d at 1294-95; U.S.S.G. \u00a7 7B 1.3(f).</p>\n<p id=\"b752-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
