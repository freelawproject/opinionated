On appeal, Betancourt argues that the IJ violated his due process rights by considering and relying on news articles to conclude that he was a supplier and leader of a drug ring, and, on that basis, denying his cancellation of removal application as a matter of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-6\">We review <em>de novo </em>our own subject matter jurisdiction. <em>Gonzalez-Oropeza v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>321 F.3d 1331, 1332 (11th Cir. 2003). When an appellant fails to offer argument on an issue, that issue is abandoned. <em>Sepulveda v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1226, 1228 n. 2 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b916-7\">A petition for review must be filed with the court of appeals no later than 30 days after the BIA\u2019s final order of removal. INA \u00a7 242(b)(1), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(1). The statutory time limit for filing a petition for review in an immigration proceeding is mandatory and jurisdictional and not subject to equitable tolling. <em>Dakane v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>399 F.3d 1269, 1272 n. 3 (11th Cir.2005). Similarly, a motion to reconsider filed with the BIA does not toll the review period. <em>Stone v. INS, </em>514 U.S. 386, 405-06, 115 S.Ct. 1537, 1549, 131 L.Ed.2d 465 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b916-8\">To timely petition for review of the BIA\u2019s July 24, 2012, order dismissing Be-tancourt\u2019s appeal, the petition had to be filed within 30 days of that date or by August 23, 2012. INA \u00a7 242(b)(1), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(1). Consequently, Be-tancourt\u2019s October 16, 2012, petition for review with this Court is untimely as to the July 2012 order. INA \u00a7 242(b)(1), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(1); <em>Stone, </em>514 U.S. at 405-06, 115 S.Ct. at 1549. Accordingly, we dismiss Betancourt\u2019s petition for review as to the BIA\u2019s July 2012 order for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-10\">Betancourt\u2019s petition is timely as to the BIA\u2019s September 19, 2012, denial of his motion to reconsider. However, because he failed to offer any argument about the denial of his motion to reconsider in his initial brief on appeal, he has abandoned any such argument. <em>See Sepulveda, </em>401 F.3d at 1228 n. 2. Accordingly, we deny the petition to the extent that it seeks review of the BIA\u2019s denial of Betancourt\u2019s motion to reconsider.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-11\">PETITION DISMISSED IN PART, DENIED IN PART.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
