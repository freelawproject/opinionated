Anfield is currently serving a total sentence of 188 months\u2019 imprisonment for possession with intent to distribute cocaine base and being a felon in possession of a firearm.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> In his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion, Anfield requested that the district court reduce that sentence in light of Amendment 750 to the Sentencing Guidelines, which lowered the base offense levels corresponding to some crack offenses. The district court concluded that Amendment 750 had lowered Anfield\u2019s guideline sentencing range, but denied the motion, making this observation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b856-18\">The defendant enlisted the assistance of his daughter in his drug sales, and his home, upon a search, was found to contain illegal drugs and firearms. The defendant had three prior felony drug convictions, which suggests to the Court that this defendant is unlikely to turn away from criminal behavior in the future. Pursuant to the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), the Court finds that the 188-month sentence the defendant is presently serving is the appropriate sentence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b856-19\">On appeal, Anfield argues that comments made by Judge Edenfield during his earlier change-of-plea hearing show that the judge is racially prejudiced and improperly biased against him. He requests that, due to Judge Edenfield\u2019s bias, we (1) remove him from the case; (2) vacate An-field\u2019s guilty plea, sentence, and the court\u2019s denial of his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion; and (3) remand the case back to the district court for adjudication before a new judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"831\">*831</page-number>We review a district court\u2019s decision to grant or deny a \u00a7 8582(c)(2) sentence reduction for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. White, </em>305 F.3d 1264, 1267 (11th Cir.2002). But a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceeding \u201cdoes not constitute a <em>de novo </em>resentenc-ing,\u201d and <em>\u201call </em>original sentencing determinations remain unchanged with the sole exception of the guideline range that has been amended since the original sentencing.\u201d <em>United States v. Bravo, </em>203 F.3d 778, 781 (11th Cir.2000) (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b857-5\">Under \u00a7 3582(c), the district court \u201cmay not modify a term of imprisonment once it has been imposed except ... (2) in the case of a defendant who has been sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c). Amendment 750, effective November 1, 2011, reduced the base offense levels corresponding to some cocaine base possession offenses. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G.App. C, Amend. 750, Part C, subpart A (2011). Once a district court has determined that a defendant\u2019s sentencing range has been lowered by an amendment, that district court \u201cmust consider the sentencing factors listed in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), as well as public safety considerations ... in evaluating whether a reduction in the defendant\u2019s sentence is warranted.\u201d <em>United States v. Williams, </em>557 F.3d 1254, 1256 (11th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b857-6\">Anfield\u2019s requests that this court remove Judge Edenfield from the case, vacate his conviction and sentence, and remand the case back to the district court for adjudication before a new judge are not properly raised in a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceeding, and are outside the scope of this appeal. <em>See Bravo, </em>203 F.3d at 781. For Anfield\u2019s remaining request, that we reverse the district court\u2019s denial of his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion, he has not shown that the district court abused its discretion. The district court properly calculated An-field\u2019s amended guideline range, and the record shows that the court denied the \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion due to Anfield\u2019s offense conduct and to the court\u2019s consideration of the \u00a7 3553(a) sentencing factors, rather than the racial prejudice or bias that Anfield alleges.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b856-15\"> Anfield had actually been sentenced to more time, but the District Court reduced the sentence once before the present motion was filed.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
