The Government has filed a brief on the merits and does not suggest that the denial of \u00a7 3582(c)(2) relief is not properly before us; thus, we address the merits of Brown\u2019s arguments. <em>See United States v. Martinez, </em>496 F.3d 387, 388-89 (5th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b310-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>Brown argues that the denial of the motion has resulted in an above-guidelines sentence, because he was initially sentenced within the Sentencing Guidelines, but his sentence is now above the revised Guidelines. He contends that the district court clearly erred by ignoring his lack of violent infractions in prison, his educational accomplishments, his close family ties, and the fact that his criminal history category over-represents the seriousness of his prior offenses. We review the district court\u2019s decision for abuse of discretion. <em>See United States v. Evans, </em>587 F.3d 667, 672 (5th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b310-4\">The district court determined that Brown was eligible for a reduction in sentence based on Amendment 750 of the Sentencing Guidelines; however, the court concluded that a reduction was not appropriate in light of the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors, Brown\u2019s prior criminal history, his violent conduct during his arrest, the facts surrounding his conviction, and the fact that his sentence has already been reduced pursuant to a prior \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion. <em>See Dillon v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 130 S.Ct. 2683, 2691, 177 L.Ed.2d 271 (2010). Brown has failed to show that the district court abused its discretion in denying his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion. <em>See Evans, </em>587 F.3d at 672.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b309-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
