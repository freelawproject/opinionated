For the reasons which follow, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-10\">In 1994, a jury found Mr. Stutson guilty of conspiring to possess cocaine, cocaine base, marijuana, and PCP with the intent to distribute. <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 846, 841(a)(1) <em>&amp; </em>(b)(1)(A). Because Mr. Stut-son had three prior felony drug convictions, and because the government had filed a notice of intent to seek an enhanced penalty, <em>see </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 851, the district court sentenced him in 1998 (following a remand from this court) to a statutory minimum term of life imprisonment. <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b749-11\">In 2011, Mr. Stutson filed the \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion that is the subject of this appeal. In that motion, he sought a sentence reduction based on Amendment 750 to the Sentencing Guidelines. The district court denied the motion, concluding that Amendment 750 did not change Mr. Stutson\u2019s statutory minimum term of life imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-12\">The arguments Mr. Stutson makes in favor of reversal are foreclosed by our precedent. First, we have held several times that a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion is properly denied where \u2014 as here \u2014 the defendant was sentenced to a statutory minimum term of imprisonment. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Williams, </em>549 F.3d 1337, 1341 (11th Cir.2008); <em>United States v. Mills, </em>613 F.3d 1070, 1077-78 (11th Cir.2010); <em>United States v. Glover, </em>686 F.3d 1203, 1206-07 (11th Cir.2012). Second, as we explained in <em>United States v. Lawson, </em>686 F.3d 1317, 1320-21 (11th Cir.2012), the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Freeman v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 2685, 180 L.Ed.2d 519 (2011), did not abrogate our prior cases holding that a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) reduction is unavailable to narcotics defendants whose sentence is not based on USSG \u00a7 2B1.1. Third, a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion cannot be used to revisit findings and rulings made at the original sentencing hearing. <em>See United States v. Bravo, </em>203 F.3d 778, 781 (11th Cir.2000). Fourth, our recent decision in <em>United States v. Hippolyte, </em>712 F.3d 535, 540-42 (11th Cir.2013), holds that (a) the new definition of \u201capplicable guideline range\u201d in Amendment 759 does not provide \u00a7 3582(c)(2) relief for defendants who received statutory minimum terms of imprisonment, and (2) the Fair Sentencing Act does not apply retroactively in a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceeding to defendants sentenced before the Act\u2019s effective date.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-16\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
