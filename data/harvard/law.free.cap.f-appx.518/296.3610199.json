Contesting that sentence, Hammeren challenges the district court\u2019s enhancing his sentence under Guideline \u00a7 2G2.2 (trafficking sexually-exploitative material involving minors). Despite his conceding he waived his appellate rights under a plea agreement, Hammeren contends the waiver is unenforceable because: his plea was not knowing and voluntary; the district court implicitly rejected the waiver by advising him during sentencing of his right to appeal; the Government\u2019s failing to object to the court\u2019s advising him of his appellate rights precludes it from invoking the waiver on appeal; the plea agreement was a contract of adhesion, procured by prosecu-torial vindictiveness and against public policy; and the waiver is contrary to his constitutional right to appeal and appellate courts\u2019 duty to review criminal sentences. (The enhancement issues raised on appeal do not fall within the two below-described exceptions to the appeal waiver.) Because the Government invoked the waiver, we consider its application. <em>United States v. Story, </em>439 F.3d 226, 231 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b322-20\">The validity of an appeal waiver is reviewed <em>de novo. United States v. Burns, </em>433 F.3d 442, 445 (5th Cir.2005). Defendant may waive his right to appeal as part of a valid plea agreement if the waiver is knowing and voluntary. <em>E.g., United </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number><em>States v. McKinney, </em>406 F.3d 744, 746 (5th Cir.2005). \u201cTo determine whether an appeal of a sentence is barred by an appeal waiver provision in a plea agreement, [our court] conduces] a two-step inquiry: (1) whether the waiver was knowing and voluntary and (2) whether the waiver applies to the circumstances at hand, based on the plain language of the agreement.\u201d <em>United States v. Bond, </em>414 F.3d 542, 544 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b323-5\">At rearraignment, the district court specifically addressed the appeal-waiver provision of the agreement and obtained Hammeren\u2019s affirmative and explicit understanding he was waiving his right to appeal \u201cexcept for any later claim of ineffective assistance of counsel or any later claim of prosecutorial misconduct\u201d. Further, the Government kept its promises made in the plea agreement. Accordingly, the waiver was knowing and voluntary. <em>E.g., McKinney, </em>406 F.3d at 746-47.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-6\">Hammeren\u2019s asserting the court\u2019s statement at sentencing that he had the right to appeal constituted its implicit rejection of the appeal-waiver provision is speculative. Further, a district court does not have the authority to both accept a plea agreement while striking the appeal-waiver provision. <em>United States v. Serrano-Lara, </em>698 F.3d 841, 844-45 (5th Cir.2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b323-7\">Hammeren\u2019s contending the plea agreement should not be enforced because it is a contract of adhesion is also unavailing. He identifies no terms contained in his waiver that have been deemed unconscionable by our court in other cases. Waivers of the statutory right to appeal, in plea agreements similar to Hammeren\u2019s, are routinely permitted. <em>E.g., Burns, </em>433 F.3d at 449-50; <em>Bond, </em>414 F.3d at 544-45.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-8\">Hammeren\u2019s remaining contentions challenging the validity of the appeal waiver are foreclosed by <em>United States v. Melancon, </em>972 F.2d 566, 567-68 (5th Cir. 1992), which rejected the contention that knowing and intelligent waivers of appellate rights are unconstitutional or otherwise unenforceable. Accordingly, we do not consider the other issues raised in Hammeren\u2019s appeal, which concern Guideline \u00a7 2G2.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-10\">DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b322-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
