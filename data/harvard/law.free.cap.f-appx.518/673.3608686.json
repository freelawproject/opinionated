On appeal, Paitan argues the district court erred by awarding Culbertson attorney\u2019s fees in the amount of $182.91, rather than $4,281.88. He maintains the district court erroneously concluded that the total amount of attorney\u2019s fees recoverable under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 406(a), \u00a7 406(b), and the Equal Access to Justice Act (EAJA), 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2412(d), could not exceed 25% of Paltan\u2019s past-due benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-4\">The district court did not err in its attorney\u2019s fees calculation.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Paitan was represented in his proceedings before the Social Security Administration by J. Michael Matthews. After the Commissioner of Social Security denied Paltan\u2019s application for benefits, Paitan, represented by Culbertson, successfully appealed to the district court. Following the district court\u2019s remand, the Social Security Administration awarded Paitan $38,327.35 in past-due benefits. Accordingly, Matthews and Culbertson could receive, in the aggregate, 25% of those past-due benefits as attorney\u2019s fees, or $9,581.83. <em>See Dawson v. Finch, </em>425 F.2d 1192, 1195 (5th Cir. 1970) (holding that 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 406 \u201cprecludes the aggregate allowance of attorney\u2019s fees greater than twenty-five percent of the past due benefits received by the claimant\u201d).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Because Matthews received $5,300.00 in attorney\u2019s fees pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 406(a) for his work before the Social Security Administration, Culbertson was entitled only to $4,281.83 under \u00a7 406(b) for his work before the district court \u2014 i.e., the remainder of the $9,581.83 of past-due benefits available for attorney\u2019s fees. <em>See Dawson, </em>425 F.2d at 1195.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-9\">Culbertson, however, previously obtained an attorney\u2019s fees award of $4,098.92 under the EAJA for the work he did before the district court. As such, the \u201cSavings Provision\u201d of the EAJA required Culbertson to refund either the EAJA award or the \u00a7 406(b) award, whichever was smaller. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2412, note; Pub. L. No. 99-80, \u00a7 3, 99 Stat. 186 (1985); see <em>also Jackson v. Comm\u2019r of Soc. Sec., </em>601 F.3d 1268, 1271-72 (11th Cir.2010). Because the $4,098.92 EAJA award was smaller than the \u00a7 406(b) award of $4,281.83, Culbertson was required to refund the EAJA award to Paitan. Culbertson had the option of either refunding the EAJA award to Paitan directly, or reducing his \u00a7 406(b) award by $4,098.92, leaving him with a \u00a7 406(b) award of $182.91, the figure calculated by the district court.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>See Jackson, </em>601 F.3d at 1274 (explaining that an attorney who receives fees under both the EAJA and \u00a7 406(b) \u201cmay choose to effectuate the refund by deducting the amount of an earlier EAJA award from his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"675\">*675</page-number>subsequent 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 406(b) fee request\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b701-5\">In performing this calculus, the district court did not create a new rule limiting attorney\u2019s fees awards under \u00a7 406(a), \u00a7 406(b), and the EAJA to 25% of a claimant\u2019s past-due benefits. Instead, the district court followed binding Circuit precedent in imposing a 25% cap on attorney\u2019s fees under \u00a7 406(a) and (b) in the aggregate. The court, moreover, did not err by refusing to allow Culbertson to offset his EAJA award by deducting it from the total of Paltan\u2019s past-due benefits, which included the \u00a7 406(a) award to Matthews, or by prohibiting Culbertson from receiving double payment under the EAJA and \u00a7 406(b) for representing Paitan before the district court. <em>See id. </em>at 1272 (\u201cWe have previously recognized that the Savings Provision was intended to prevent attorneys from receiving double recovery under both the EAJA and \u00a7 406(b).\u201d). Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s award of attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b699-19\">.
