The district court determined that Arvie was barred from proceeding IFP because he had accumulated three strikes under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Arvie does not dispute that he has three strikes but argues that the \u00a7 1915(g) bar should not apply because he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. In support of this contention, he states that his requests to see a cardiac specialist and for \u201cnecessary life-sustaining treatment\u201d for his hepatitis was denied and that if his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>Hepatitis C is not properly treated, he will sustain irreversible liver damage. Additionally, he asserts that he is forced to eat foods that cause him to experience chest and kidney pains.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-5\">\u201c[A] prisoner with three strikes is entitled to proceed with his action or appeal only if he is in imminent danger at the time that he seeks to file his suit in district court or seeks to proceed with his appeal or files a motion to proceed IFP.\u201d <em>Banos v. O\u2019Guin, </em>144 F.3d 883, 884 (5th Cir.1998). Arvie\u2019s contentions indicate that he suffers from a variety of chronic medical conditions for which he is receiving treatment. Although he apparently disagrees with the course of his treatment, there is nothing to suggest that Arvie\u2019s medical conditions place him in imminent danger of serious physical injury. Accordingly, his motion for leave to proceed IFP is DENIED and the appeal is DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b330-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b330-20\">. <em>See Arvie v. Lastrapes, </em>No. 95-30967, 1997 WL 34211855 (5th Cir.
