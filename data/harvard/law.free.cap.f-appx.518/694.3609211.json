On December 2, 2008, the Department of Homeland Security issued a notice to appear charging Petitioners with remov-ability pursuant to Immigration and Naturalization Act (\u201cINA\u201d) \u00a7 212(a)(6)(A)(i), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(6)(A)(i), as aliens present in the United States without being admitted or paroled. Petitioners applied for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the U.N. Convention Against Torture.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-15\">At a master calendar hearing, Petitioners appeared with counsel, conceded re-movability and withdrew their application for asylum and other relief. Instead, they filed applications for cancellation of removal, indicating that their removal would result in exceptional hardship to their two children (daughters), both U.S. citizens.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On April 5, 2010, an Immigration Judge (\u201cIJ\u201d) heard their application at an eviden-tiary hearing at which Petitioners were represented by the same attorney and testified. At the conclusion of the hearing, the IJ denied Petitioner\u2019s application.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-16\">Petitioners, still represented by the attorney, appealed the IJ\u2019s decision to the Board of Immigration Appeals (\u201cBIA\u201d). It dismissed the appeal and denied Petitioner\u2019s motion to remand on April 8, 2012. On June 28, 2012, Petitioner, represented by new counsel, moved the BIA to reopen, claiming ineffective assistance of their pri- or attorney because he failed to timely submit medical evidence regarding their two daughters. The BIA, finding no prejudice in the attorney\u2019s representation because the newly submitted evidence was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"696\">*696</page-number>insufficient to establish the requisite level of hardship necessary for cancellation of removal, denied the motion to reopen on September 24, 2012.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-4\">Petitioners now petition this court for review, arguing that the BIA abused its discretion in denying their motion to reopen because they established that they were prejudiced by their prior attorney\u2019s failure to submit medical evidence related to their daughter Karyn\u2019s medical condition at their cancellation of removal hearing. Petitioners also argue that they were deprived of due process by counsel\u2019s ineffective assistance because they have a liberty interest in their daughter\u2019s health and well-being.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-5\">We review the BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to reopen for an abuse of discretion. <em>Mejia Rodriguez v. Reno, </em>178 F.3d 1139, 1145 (11th Cir.1999). Judicial review is limited to determining \u201cwhether there has been an exercise of administrative discretion and whether the matter of exercise has been arbitrary and capricious.\u201d <em>Garcia-Mir v. Smith, </em>766 F.2d 1478, 1490 (11th Cir.1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b722-6\">Where represented by counsel, aliens are entitled to effective assistance of counsel under the Fifth Amendment\u2019s Due Process Clause. <em>See Mejia Rodriguez, </em>178 F.3d at 1146. \u201c[A]n alien must establish that his or her counsel\u2019s performance was deficient to the point that it impinged the \u2018fundamental fairness\u2019 of the hearing.\u201d <em>Id. </em>However, \u201can attorney\u2019s deficient representation does not deprive an alien of due process if the deficient representation merely prevents the alien from being eligible for suspension of deportation,\u201d because the alien\u2019s chances of receiving discretionary relief are too speculative. <em>Id. </em>at 1148. The same rationale applies in precluding relief in applications for cancellation of removal. <em>Mohammed v. Ashcroft, </em>261 F.3d 1244, 1250-51 (11th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b722-10\">An alien can move to reopen his removal order on the basis of ineffective assistance of counsel. <em>See Dakane v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>399 F.3d 1269, 1273-74 (11th Cir.2005). In order to establish ineffective assistance of counsel, an alien must establish that he was prejudiced as a result of counsel\u2019s alleged deficient performance. <em>Id. </em>at 1274. To establish prejudice, the petitioner must show that \u201cthe performance of counsel [was] so inadequate that there is a reasonable probability that but for the attorney\u2019s error, the outcome of the proceedings would have been different.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b722-11\">We conclude that the BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying the Petitioners\u2019 motion to reopen. The Petitioners cannot show that their due process rights were violated by their attorney\u2019s alleged ineffectiveness because they were applying for cancellation of removal.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>See Mohammed, </em>261 F.3d at 1250-51; <em>see also Mejia Rodriguez, </em>178 F.3d at 1148.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-12\">Even if they had a constitutional right to discretionary relief from removal, the Petitioners cannot show that they were prejudiced by prior counsel\u2019s failure to timely submit the medical records to the Immigration Judge (\u201cIJ\u201d). At their original hearing, the IJ denied the Petitioners\u2019 applications for cancellation of removal based on the Petitioners\u2019 failure to establish the requisite \u201cexceptional and extremely unusual\u201d hardship, because there was nothing in the record to suggest that their daughter had a serious medical condition that could not be treated in Co<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"697\">*697</page-number>lombia. The Petitioners appealed this decision to the BIA and attached medical evidence. The BIA, in turn, dismissed their appeal after determining that the medical evidence, even if it had been timely submitted to the IJ, would not have changed the outcome of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-5\">In denying the motion to reopen, the BIA noted that it had previously considered the medical evidence and determined that it did not change the outcome of the case. Additionally, while the Petitioners quoted various medical articles in their motion to reopen that provided general information about their daughter\u2019s medical condition and asserted that a medical expert should have been obtained to explain the medical records, the Petitioners have not identified any specific evidence that would have changed the BIA\u2019s earlier conclusion that they were ineligible for cancellation of removal. Accordingly, the BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying the Petitioners\u2019 motion to reopen based on ineffective assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-6\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b721-10\">.
