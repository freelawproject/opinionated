King, Jr. appeals from the final order of the district court awarding attorneys\u2019 fee award to Defendants-Appellees Early County et al. In the underlying wrongful death case, <em>Thomas v. Early County, Ga., </em>360 Fed.Appx. 71 (11th Cir.2010), this Court held that Plaintiffs Mary Thomas et al. and/or their lawyer, King, had violated Fed.R.Civ.P. 11, \u201cbecause Plaintiffs\u2019 complaints had no col-orable basis in law or fact and Plaintiffs\u2019 attorney should have known that.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 75. We then \u201cremand[ed] the case to the district court for its determination of the amount of attorney\u2019s fees and expenses to be awarded [Early County] as sanctions under Rule 11,\u201d and left \u201cto the district court a determination whether the fees and costs should be assessed against Plaintiffs, Plaintiffs\u2019 lawyer, or both.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 77. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number>On remand, the district court ordered lawyer King to pay $94,415.81 in sanctions. In this appeal, King argues that the district court abused its discretion by: (1) failing to consider King\u2019s ability to pay the award of Rule 11 sanctions; (2) basing the amount of sanctions on clearly erroneous findings of fact; and (8) partially basing the amount of sanctions on conduct that was not sanctionable. After careful review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-4\">We review an order awarding Rule 11 attorneys\u2019 fees for abuse of discretion. <em>McGregor v. Board of Commis., </em>956 F.2d 1017, 1022 (11th Cir.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b672-5\">Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b) provides that \u201c[b]y presenting to the court a pleading, written motion, or other paper[,] ... an attorney or unrepresented party\u201d certifies to the best of his knowledge that: (1) the pleading is not being presented for an improper purpose; (2) the \u201clegal contentions are warranted by existing law or by a nonfrivolous argument\u201d to change existing law; and (3) \u201cthe factual contentions have evidentiary support or ... will likely have evidentiary support after ... discovery.\u201d Once the court determines that Rule 11(b) has been violated, the court \u201cmay impose an appropriate sanction\u201d on the offending party based on a motion filed by the non-offending party. Fed.R.Civ.P. 11(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b672-6\">\u201cThe purpose of Rule 11 sanctions is to reduce frivolous claims, defenses, or motions, and to deter costly meritless maneuvers.\u201d <em>Kaplan v. DaimlerChrysler, A.G., </em>381 F.3d 1251, 1255 (11th Cir.2003) (quotation omitted). \u201c[T]he selection of the type of sanction to be imposed lies with the district court\u2019s sound exercise of discretion.\u201d <em>Riccard v. Prudential Ins. Co., </em>307 F.3d 1277, 1295 (11th Cir.2002). However, the court\u2019s discretion to impose sanctions is not unrestricted, in that the sanction \u201cmust be limited to what suffices to deter repetition of the conduct or comparable conduct by others similarly situated.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 11(c)(4). Likewise, \u201c[t]he conduct and resources of the party to be sanctioned are relevant to the determination of the amount of sanctions to be imposed.\u201d <em>Baker v. Alderman, </em>158 F.3d 516, 528 (11th Cir.1998). Specifically, we should consider the following factors in determining an appropriate sanction: (1) \u201c[w]hether the improper conduct was willful, or negligent\u201d; (2) \u201cwhether it was part of a pattern of activity, or an isolated event\u201d; (3) \u201cwhether it infected the entire pleading, or only one particular count or defense\u201d; (4) \u201cwhether the person has engaged in similar conduct in other litigation\u201d; (5) \u201cwhether it was intended to injure\u201d; (6) \u201cwhat effect it had on the litigation process in time or expense\u201d; (7) \u201cwhether the responsible person is trained in the law\u201d; (8) \u201cwhat amount, given the financial resources of the responsible person, is needed to deter that person from repetition in the same case\u201d; and (9) \u201cwhat amount is needed to deter similar activity by other litigants.\u201d Fed. R.Civ.P. 11, advisory committee notes (1993 Amendments).</p>\n<p id=\"b672-8\">First, we are unpersuaded by King\u2019s claim that the district court abused its discretion in failing to consider King\u2019s ability to pay the amount of the award. As the record shows, the district court <em>expressly </em>considered King\u2019s financial condition when it said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b672-9\">Throughout his Memorandum, Plaintiffs counsel requests that the court use its discretion to impose an \u201cappropriate sanction,\u201d and take into consideration the current difficult economic times, the small nature of Plaintiffs attorney\u2019s law practice, and Plaintiffs limited resources.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b672-10\">In order to comply with the decision of the Eleventh Circuit, the Court has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>carefully considered the parties\u2019 submissions and the chronology of this action.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A9W\">Dist. Ct. Order at 5-6, 9. Thus, there is no merit to King\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-5\">We also reject King\u2019s argument that the district court abused its discretion by determining the amount of sanctions based upon clearly erroneous findings of fact. Specifically, he claims that when the district court was choosing the kind of Rule 11 sanction to use, it noted how important deterrence was to Rule 11, and especially in this case, since the Plaintiffs had re-filed a second, identical wrongful death action <em>after </em>the Eleventh Circuit had issued its remand order finding Plaintiffs\u2019 case frivolous under Rule 11. Because, according to the record, Plaintiffs actually re-filed the second case <em>before </em>the Eleventh Circuit opinion was issued, King says that the district court clearly erred in making this factual finding and therefore abused its discretion in selecting the amount of sanctions to award.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-6\">Under our case law, \u201c[a]n abuse of discretion occurs if the judge fails to apply the proper legal standard or to follow proper procedures in making the determination, or <em>bases an award </em>upon findings of fact that are clearly erroneous.\u201d <em>In re Red Carpet Corp. of Panama City Beach, </em>902 F.2d 888, 890 (11th Cir.1990) (emphasis added). The record here reflects that the district court may have mistakenly suggested that the case was filed after the Eleventh Circuit remand order, which deemed Plaintiffs\u2019 case frivolous and held that \u201cPlaintiffs\u2019 complaints had no color-able basis in law or fact and Plaintiffs\u2019 attorney should have known that.\u201d 360 Fed.Appx. at <em>75. </em>Yet even though Plaintiffs may have filed their second, identical action before the Eleventh Circuit remand, the action was not dismissed until a year <em>after </em>the Eleventh Circuit\u2019s order was issued. Thus, any concerns the district court had about deterrence in this case remained the same: Plaintiffs were on notice of the frivolity of their claims, but they nevertheless maintained these claims in the second action for a full year, during which time they filed motions and discovery. Further, as the district court noted, deterrence was a particular issue here because the district court had agreed to dismiss the first action <em>without </em>prejudice, in part because Plaintiffs\u2019 counsel had assured the court that it would not re-file the case in federal court, but rather, in state court. But King re-filed in federal court anyway.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-8\">In short, on this record, whether Plaintiffs filed their second case before or after the Eleventh Circuit remand order is irrelevant. The fact remains that even though the Eleventh Circuit notified the Plaintiffs that their case was frivolous, Plaintiffs were not deterred. They continued to press their claims for a full year after the Eleventh Circuit order. For this reason, we cannot say that the district court\u2019s decision to award monetary Rule 11 sanctions in this case was <em>based on </em>any clearly erroneous factual findings, and therefore, nor can we say that it abused its discretion in this regard.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-9\">Finally, we find no merit to King\u2019s claim that the district court abused its discretion by partially basing the amount of sanctions on conduct that was not sanctionable. He says that Early County\u2019s original motion for Rule 11 sanction was served on June 15, 2007, when the second amended complaint was pending, and thus that all of their filings before that time were not frivolous. However, although Early County\u2019s motion for sanctions was served during the pendency of Plaintiffs\u2019 second amended complaint, Early County argued in its motion that \u201cPlaintiffs <em>initial </em>complaint in this cause was frivolous, unreasonable, groundless and lacking in any col-orable factual or legal basis.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Furthermore, in the remand or<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>der, this Court held that: (1) \u201cthe claims brought against Early County and the other Defendants in their official capacities were not legally cognizable at the time the original complaint was filed\u201d; (2) \u201cDefendants incurred attorney\u2019s fees and costs in bringing two motions to dismiss these claims [original and first amended complaints] that were futile when pleaded\u201d; (3) \u201cDefendants incurred fees and costs in continuing to litigate, through three complaints, almost four years, and the filing of a summary judgment motion, claims that Plaintiffs have not supported with <em>any </em>evidence\u201d; and (4) \u201cPlaintiffs should have known at the time they filed the first complaint that there was no support for many of the factual allegations upon which their claims rested.\u201d 360 Fed.Appx. at 75-76. Thus, any suggestion that Plaintiffs did not violate Rule 11 until they filed the second amended complaint is foreclosed by this Court\u2019s order, where we clearly found that all of Plaintiffs\u2019 complaints to date had been frivolous.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
