His wife, Xhemile Kasa joins in his petition as a derivative beneficiary of his asylum application. The Ka-sas\u2019 primary argument on appeal is that substantial evidence does not support the determination by both the IJ and the BIA that, due to a fundamental change in circumstances in Albania, Kasa no longer has a well-founded fear of persecution.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b859-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"833\">*833</page-number>\u201cWe review only the BIA\u2019s decision, except where it expressly adopts the IJ\u2019s decision.\u201d <em>Mehmeti v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>572 F.3d 1196, 1199 (11th Cir.2009). We review <em>de novo </em>the BIA\u2019s legal determinations. <em>Id. </em>We review its factual determinations \u201cunder the highly deferential substantial-evidence test and \u2018must affirm the BIA\u2019s decision if it is supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>We can reverse \u201conly when the record compels a reversal.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation marks omitted). In addition, the substantial-evidence test does not allow us to reweigh the importance attributed to the evidence in the record. <em>Djonda v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>514 F.3d 1168, 1175 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b859-5\">The Attorney General has the discretion to grant an alien asylum if the alien establishes that he is a refugee, as defined by the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA). 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(1) (2006); <em>Mehmeti, </em>572 F.3d at 1199. The definition of \u201crefugee\u201d includes, as relevant here, any person who is unable or unwilling to return to a country because \u201cof persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of ... membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A) (2006). Similarly, when seeking a withholding of removal, an alien bears the burden of showing that his \u201clife or freedom would be threatened in that country because of [his] ... membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3)(A) (2006); <em>Imelda v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>611 F.3d 724, 728 (11th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b859-8\">\u201cAn applicant who has demonstrated past persecution is presumed to have a well-founded fear of future persecution.\u201d <em>Mejia v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>498 F.3d 1253, 1257 (11th Cir.2007). The government can rebut the presumption by showing that \u201c[t]here has been a fundamental change in circumstances such that the applicant no longer has a well-founded fear of persecution\u201d or the \u201capplicant could avoid future persecution by relocating to another part of the applicant\u2019s country of nationality.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(b)(l)(i)(A)-(B) (2009). To sufficiently establish a well-founded fear of future persecution for purposes of an asylum application, the applicant \u201cneed only show that there is a <em>reasonable possibility </em>of suffering such persecution,\u201d <em>Mejia, </em>498 F.3d at 1256 (quotation marks and alteration omitted), but, for purposes of an application for withholding of removal, the applicant must show \u201cthat he more-likely-than-not would be persecuted or tortured,\u201d <em>Mendoza v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>327 F.3d 1283, 1287 (11th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b859-9\">Although the IJ determined that Kasa established past persecution and thus presumably had a well-founded fear of future persecution, both the IJ and the BIA determined that \u201cthere has been a fundamental change in circumstances in Albania\u201d so that the government suffi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"834\">*834</page-number>ciently rebutted that presumption. The record does not compel a reversal. Kasa\u2019s alleged fear of future prosecution is based on his affiliation with the Democratic Party and opposition to the Socialist Party. \u201c[F]ocus[ing] on the specific harm suffered,\u201d and the \u201cunique facts of [Kasa\u2019s] case,\u201d the \u201cparticular information\u201d in the U.S. Department of State\u2019s 2009 Human Rights Report: Albania, and Albania: Profile of Asylum Claims and Country Conditions, supported the BIA\u2019s findings. <em>See Imelda, </em>611 F.3d at 729; <em>see also Mehmeti, </em>572 F.3d at 1199-1200 (finding that despite the fact that the IJ had relied solely on reports prepared by the State Department, substantial evidence supported the determination that country conditions in Albania had changed). As highlighted by the IJ and BIA, those documents explain that Kasa\u2019s Democratic Party has taken control of Albania\u2019s Parliament, there have been no reports of political detainees or disappearances, political parties have operated without restriction, \u201cthere have been no outbreaks of political violence since 1998, and the available evidence suggests that neither the Government nor the major political parties engage in policies of abuse or coercion against their political opponents.\u201d <em>See Imelda, </em>611 F.3d at 729-30 (explaining that courts have found substantial evidence supported a fundamental change where there was evidence of \u201ca change in the government that persecuted the petitioner,\u201d and \u201cwhere the evidence demonstrates a substantial decline in violence against persecuted groups\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b860-4\">Because the record does not compel a reversal, the judgment of the BIA is affirmed and Kasa\u2019s petition for review is</p>\n<p id=\"b860-5\">DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b858-15\">. The Kasas make two other arguments on appeal. First, they argue that the IJ erred in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"833\">*833</page-number>determining that Kasa could relocate within Albania to avoid future persecution. However, because the BIA expressly did not adopt or affirm the IJ\u2019s conclusion on this point, it is not a part of the order currently under review and we will not address the Kasas\u2019 argument. <em>See Lopez v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>504 F.3d 1341, 1344 (11th Cir.2007). Second, the Kasas argue that even if the IJ and BIA were correct that there was no well-founded fear of persecution, they failed to consider whether humanitarian relief, pursuant to 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.13(b)(l)(iii), was warranted. But, \"without excuse or exception,\u201d Kasa never requested that relief from the IJ and did not raise this issue on appeal to the BIA. It is therefore beyond the scope of our review. <em>See Amaya-Artunduaga v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>463 F.3d 1247, 1250-51 (11th Cir.2006) (determining that we do not have jurisdiction to consider a claim not raised before the BIA). Neither have the Kasas raised any arguments on appeal regarding their CAT relief claim, so any such argument has been waived. <em>See United States v. Ardley, </em>242 F.3d 989, 990 (11th Cir.2001).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
