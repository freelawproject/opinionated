(NBOME) and Anthony Silvagni. The Defendants cross appeal the district court\u2019s denial of their motions to declare Plaintiff Jallali a vexatious litigant. After review, we affirm both of the district court\u2019s rulings.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-14\">I. Claims in Plaintiffs Amended Complaint</p>\n<p id=\"b891-15\">According to Jallali\u2019s amended complaint, Defendant NBOME administers the Comlex I and II medical examinations needed for medical licensure in all fifty jurisdictions in the United States. Defendant Silvagni is the Dean of the College of Osteopathic Medicine at Nova Southeastern University and a former NBOME consultant. After Jallali sat for the Comlex I and II medical exams, he sued NBOME in Florida state court. During a deposition in that state court litigation, an NBOME employee admitted destroying Jallali\u2019s exam sheets and other test materials before the expiration of the five-year retention policy spelled out in NBOME\u2019s contract with the State of Florida. The NBOME employee\u2019s admission is the basis for this federal action.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-16\">Jallali\u2019s amended complaint alleged, pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, that the Defendants conspired to violate Jallali\u2019s constitutional right of access to the courts by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"866\">*866</page-number>destroying his Comlex I and II exam materials. (Count Three). The amended complaint also alleged a state law claim of civil conspiracy (Count Four) against both Defendants and state law claims of negligent spoliation of evidence (Count One), obstruction of justice (Count Two), and negligent supervision (Count Five) solely against NBOME.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-3\">Jallali\u2019s original complaint pled both federal question jurisdiction, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331, and diversity jurisdiction, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332. Defendant NBOME is an Illinois non-profit corporation. But, Defendant Silvagni moved to dismiss the original complaint for lack of complete diversity, pointing out that both he and Jallali were Florida citizens.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-4\">Jallali then filed an amended complaint, alleging federal question jurisdiction over his \u00a7 1983 claim and supplemental jurisdiction, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1367(a), over his state law claims, but otherwise asserting all of the same claims against the same Defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-5\">II. Defendants\u2019 Motions to Dismiss Amended Complaint</p>\n<p id=\"b892-6\">The district court granted the defendants\u2019 motions to dismiss the amended complaint. Specifically, the district court dismissed with prejudice Jallali\u2019s \u00a7 1983 conspiracy claim under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) for failure to state a claim because the amended complaint had not alleged that the Defendants had acted under color of state law. The district court concluded that the allegations in the amended complaint did not satisfy any of the three tests for establishing state action by a private entity, including the public function test, the state compulsion test or the nexus/joint action test. <em>See Rayburn ex rel. Rayburn v. Hogue, </em>241 F.3d 1341, 1347-48 (11th Cir.2001); <em>Harvey v. Harvey, </em>949 F.2d 1127, 1130 (11th Cir.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b892-7\">The district court relied in part on <em>Langston v. ACT, </em>in which this Court concluded that the American College Testing Program, which administers the ACT test, was not a state actor under any of the three tests. <em>Langston, </em>890 F.2d 380, 384-85 (11th Cir.1989); <em>see also Johnson v. Educ. Testing Serv., </em>754 F.2d 20, 24-25 (1st Cir.1985) (concluding the same with respect to a non-profit corporation that administered the LSAT test). The district court also noted that, while Defendant NBOME administered the Comlex tests and reported scores, it was \u201cnot empowered to license physicians, a task left to the State of Florida.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b892-8\">Finding that Jallali\u2019s \u00a7 1983 conspiracy claim was the sole basis for original federal jurisdiction, the district court, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1367(c)(3), declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over Jallali\u2019s state law claims. In so doing, the district court pointed out that, without complete diversity, there was no basis for diversity jurisdiction, and that Jallali had made no arguments as to why his remaining state law claims should not be dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. The district court dismissed the state law claims without prejudice, however, so that Jallali could pursue them in state court.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-9\">In its dismissal order, the district court also denied the Defendants\u2019 motions to declare Jallali a vexatious litigant under the All Writs Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1651(a). The district court explained that it had dismissed only one of Jallali\u2019s claims on the merits and that the Defendants could seek relief in state court or in the courts where previous judgments against Jallali were rendered.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-10\">III. Plaintiff Jallali\u2019s Rule 59(e) Motion</p>\n<p id=\"b892-11\">Plaintiff Jallali filed a Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 59(e) motion to alter or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"867\">*867</page-number>amend the judgment asking the district court for leave to amend his complaint to remove Defendant Silvagni as a defendant so that he then could proceed against Defendant NBOME in diversity.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-5\">The district court denied the Rule 59(e) motion, finding that Jallali had not offered any grounds justifying reconsideration. <em>See Arthur v. King, </em>500 F.3d 1335, 1343 (11th Cir.2007) (\u201cThe only grounds for granting a Rule 59 motion are newly-discovered evidence or manifest errors of law or fact.\u201d (quotation marks and brackets omitted)). The district court further stressed that Jallali: (1) \u201chad every opportunity to amend his pleadings to remove Silvagni as a defendant in the earlier stages of this litigation\u201d; (2) \u201cwas aware of the strategic risk he took in keeping Sil-vagni as a defendant to this action\u201d; and (3) \u201ccould have sought leave to amend his pleadings to enable him to argue diversity jurisdiction before [the district court\u2019s] Order of Dismissal was entered,\u201d but did not. The district court concluded that Jallali\u2019s motion attempted to take \u201ca second bite at the apple to take procedural steps that he should have taken before the Order of Dismissal was made.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b893-6\">IV. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b893-7\">After careful review of the record and the parties\u2019 briefs, we conclude that the district court properly dismissed Plaintiff Jallali\u2019s amended complaint for the reasons outlined in the district court\u2019s well-reasoned order dated August 2, 2012. As the district court correctly concluded, Jal-lali\u2019s allegations, taken as true, do not establish that the Defendants acted under color of state law when they conspired to destroy Jallali\u2019s exam materials, which is necessary for \u00a7 1983 liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-8\">Further, the district court did not abuse its discretion in declining to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the remaining state law claims. The district court also did not abuse its discretion in denying Jallali\u2019s Rule 59(e) motion given that the motion did not assert any basis for relief under Rule 59(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b893-10\">With respect to the Defendants\u2019 cross appeal, we cannot say the district court abused its discretion in denying the Defendants\u2019 motions to declare Jallali a vexatious litigant. The district court\u2019s judgment is affirmed in full.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
