The BIA also determined that Thiam was not eligible for a waiver of removability under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(7) or for special rule cancellation of removal under \u00a7 1229b(b)(2). Thiam has abandoned any challenge to these latter determinations by failing to address them in his petition for review. <em>See Thuri v. Ashcroft, </em>380 F.3d 788, 793 (5th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b333-6\">Thiam argues that, although the BIA\u2019s order stated the correct legal standards, its adverse decision demonstrates that the BIA improperly conducted a de novo review and reweighed the facts of the case. The BIA is entitled to review de novo the immigration judge\u2019s decision whether a favorable exercise of discretion is warranted. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(d)(3)(ii). We do not have jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s decision that a favorable exercise of its discretion to grant \u00a7 1229b relief was not warranted. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B)\u00a9; <em>Delgado-Reynua v. Gonzales, </em>450 F.3d 596, 599-600 (5th Cir.2006); <em>Rueda v. Ashcroft, </em>380 F.3d 831, 831 (5th Cir.2004). Accordingly, Thiam\u2019s petition for review is DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b333-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
