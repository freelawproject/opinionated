Granados argues that one criminal history point should not have been assigned to his 2010 Oklahoma open container traffic offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-19\">The Government argues that appeal of this sentencing issue is moot and, in the alternative, that the criminal history point was properly assigned to Granados\u2019s prior open container traffic offense. Granados has not filed a reply brief and, thus, has not responded to the Government\u2019s mootness argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-20\">The district court sentenced Granados to 15 months of imprisonment with credit for time served in custody since March 24, 2011. This term of imprisonment necessarily expired on or about June 24, 2012. The Department of Homeland Security has confirmed that Granados was removed from the United States on June 30, 2012. For these reasons, Granados\u2019s appeal is moot. <em>See United States v. Rosenbawm-Alanis, </em>483 F.3d 381, 383 (5th Cir.2007). Accordingly, the appeal is DISMISSED AS MOOT.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b304-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
