After a bench trial, the district court agreed with Slep-Tone about liability but found that the bars\u2019 profits were not an appropriate measure of Slep-Tone\u2019s damages. Slep-Tone contests that finding in this appeal and also challenges several discovery rulings.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-7\">Slep-Tone produced compact discs containing music and videos to accompany karaoke performances. Each disc contains the instrumental music and a video that displays the lyrics of the selected song. Slep-Tone owns the valid, federally registered trademark SOUND CHOICE, and it owns a trademark in a SOUND CHOICE logo. That trademarked logo appears on each of the compact discs, the insert that accompanies each disc, and the video that accompanies each song. According to Slep-Tone, SOUND CHOICE \u201cis recognized as one of the leading producers of high-quality karaoke accompaniment tracks.\u201d In the past, Slep-Tone sold each song for $1.50, but it has reduced the price to $0.75 per song to compete with pirated copies.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-8\">It is common practice in the karaoke industry to upload music and video files from compact discs to a computer hard drive. That practice, known as \u201cmedia shifting,\u201d makes it easier for hosts of karaoke shows to transport their equipment from one location to another. Slep-Tone did not initially allow media shifting of its SOUND CHOICE product, but because it commonly occurred, Slep-Tone developed and began enforcing a \u201cMedia Shifting Policy\u201d in 2007. The policy allowed consumers to transfer SOUND CHOICE files from compact discs to a computer hard drive if they complied with three conditions. First, the consumer had to own the compact disc for each karaoke track on a hard drive. Second, the consumer had to notify Slep-Tone before transferring any files from a compact disc to a hard drive. Finally, the consumer had to allow Slep-Tone to audit its karaoke system to check compliance with the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-11\">Donovan\u2019s Reef Lounge &amp; Package Store, Inc. and Green Glass Mall, Inc., which share some common ownership, operate two liquor stores and bars in Panama City Beach, Florida. Both bars owned the equipment needed to put on karaoke shows and did so frequently to attract customers. That equipment included three red hard drives, all of which had the same files on them. One red hard drive was for Donovan\u2019s Reef, the second was for Green Glass, and the third was a backup. The three red hard drives were created by copying the files from a silver hard drive. The silver hard drive was created by media shifting music and video files from SOUND CHOICE compact discs. As a result of that process, each of the three red hard drives contained electronic files that were equivalent to 222 compact discs.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-12\">Under Slep-Tone\u2019s media shifting policy, Donovan\u2019s Reef and Green Glass Mall collectively should have had three physical compact discs for each of the 222 discs that had files on each of the three hard drives. That is a total of 666 discs. When Slep-Tone audited Donovan\u2019s Reef and Green Glass Mall, however, it found that together they had only 240 discs. In other words, their required collection was missing 426 discs.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"818\">*818</page-number>II.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-4\">Slep-Tone brought five separate lawsuits in the Northern District of Florida against Donovan\u2019s Reef, Green Glass Mall, and dozens of other defendants, alleging infringement of the SOUND CHOICE trademark and state law claims for deceptive and unfair trade practices.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Those suits were consolidated into a single action under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 42(a)(2). Slep-Tone\u2019s claims against many of the defendants settled. The claims against three of the defendants, however, including Donovan\u2019s Reef and Green Glass Mall, proceeded to a bench trial. Following the bench trial, the district court entered judgment against Donovan\u2019s Reef and Green Glass Mall in the amount of $9,585.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b844-5\">Slep-Tone appeals that judgment, raising two issues related to the relief it sought and two issues related to discovery.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> As to the relief-related issues, Slep-Tone contends that the district court erred by: (1) not awarding as damages profits from the defendants\u2019 bars; and (2) not granting a permanent injunction against future unauthorized use of the SOUND CHOICE trademark by Donovan\u2019s Reef and Green Glass Mall. As to the discovery issues, Slep-Tone contends that the district court erred by: (1) granting Donovan\u2019s Reefs motion to compel Slep-Tone\u2019s corporate representative\u2019s deposition testimony about certain matters; and (2) not awarding it attorney\u2019s fees for the defendants\u2019 failure to permit inspection of their karaoke discs and systems.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-10\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-11\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-12\">Slep-Tone first contends that the district court should have awarded it damages in the form of the profits Donovan\u2019s Reef and Green Glass Mall earned from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"819\">*819</page-number>their alcohol sales during the times that karaoke shows were performed in their bars. The Lanham Act provides that a plaintiff who prevails in a trademark infringement action \u201cshall be entitled, subject to the provisions of [15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1111 and 1114], and subject to the principles of equity, to recover (1) defendant\u2019s profits, (2) any damages sustained by the plaintiff, and (3) the costs of the action.\u201d 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1117(a). The Act, however, gives the district court broad discretion to award damages that are appropriate to the facts of the particular case. It states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b845-4\">In assessing damages the court may enter judgment, according to the circumstances of the case, for any sum above the amount found as actual damages, not exceeding three times such amount. If the court shall find that the amount of the recovery based on profits is either inadequate or excessive the court may in its discretion enter judgment for such sum as the court shall find to be just, according to the circumstances of the case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b845-5\"><em>Id.; see also Ramada Inns, Inc. v. Gadsden Motel Co., </em>804 F.2d 1562, 1564-65 (11th Cir.1986) (explaining that \u201cthe Lan-ham Act ... expressly confers upon district judges wide discretion in determining a just amount of recovery for trademark infringement\u201d) (quoting <em>Holiday Inns, Inc. v. Alberding, </em>683 F.2d 931, 935 (5th Cir. 1982)); <em>Burger King Corp. v. Mason, </em>710 F.2d 1480, 1495 (11th Cir.1983) (noting that 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1117 \u201cvests considerable discretion in the district court\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b845-6\">Because of the broad discretion the Act confers on the district court, \u201cthe district court\u2019s damage assessment is entitled to deference.\u201d <em>Ramada Inns, </em>804 F.2d at 1564. We will not disturb it on appeal unless it is \u201cclearly inadequate.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Holiday Inns, </em>683 F.2d at 935). Here, the district court awarded Slep-Tone $9,585 in damages, which \u201crepresents] the amount of lost revenue for a total of 426 discs at wholesale price.\u201d The court concluded that awarding profits was not appropriate in this case because although Slep-Tone \u201cmay have proven defendants\u2019 bar sales by a preponderance of the evidence,\u201d it did not \u201ctrace[] those sales in a reliable way to karaoke performances.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b845-9\">Slep-Tone contends that the district court should have awarded it profits because it proved that the defendants\u2019 conduct was willful and deliberate. It also contends that it was the defendants\u2019 burden to prove which portion of the bars\u2019 profits was not attributable to the infringement of Slep-Tone\u2019s trademark. Slep-Tone\u2019s arguments miss the mark. As we have already explained, the district court has considerable discretion to award damages that are appropriate to the unique facts of the case. When the district court concludes that an award of profits is \u201cexcessive,\u201d 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1117 expressly provides that it may award an amount of damages \u201cas [it] shall find to be just.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b845-10\">In calculating the appropriate damages award in this case, the district court correctly observed that \u201c[t]his is not the typical trademark case where the infringer produces a product and markets it under the trademark of another.\u201d Accordingly, the defendants\u2019 profits do not necessarily provide an accurate \u2014 or even a reasonable \u2014 estimate of Slep-Tone\u2019s damages. As the court correctly pointed out, it defies common sense to assume that all the profits a bar makes during the time it is offering karaoke are attributable to the fact that it is offering karaoke. Nor was there any evidence presented at trial that reliably estimated what percentage of the defendants\u2019 profits was attributable to the fact that they offered karaoke. Furthermore, the evidence at trial showed that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"820\">*820</page-number>defendants did not directly profit from the fact that they offered karaoke shows bearing the SOUND CHOICE trademark; they did not require customers to pay a cover charge during those times; nor did they charge a fee for a person to step up to the microphone and sing. On the facts of this case, the district court\u2019s award of actual damages of $9,585 was not \u201cclearly inadequate.\u201d We therefore affirm that award.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-4\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-5\">Slep-Tone next contends that the district court erred by not granting a permanent injunction against unauthorized use of the SOUND CHOICE trademark. We review for an abuse of discretion a district court\u2019s denial of an injunction. <em>Angel Flight of Ga., Inc. v. Angel Flight America, Inc., </em>522 F.3d 1200, 1208 (11th Cir.2008). In determining whether to grant injunctive relief, the district court should consider whether: (1) the plaintiff has suffered an irreparable injury; (2) legal remedies are inadequate to redress that injury; (3) equitable relief is warranted based on the balance of hardships between the plaintiff and defendant; (4) granting injunctive relief serves the public interest. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b846-6\">Here, the district court denied Slep-Tone\u2019s request for a permanent injunction, stating only:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b846-7\">I decline to enter an injunction against the future use of the [SOUND CHOICE] mark because the boundaries of [the] media shifting policy are ill defined and it would be difficult to fashion an injunction to comport with that policy. The defendants are now on notice that their use is subject to Plaintiffs scrutiny and are cautioned that their future actions must comply with applicable trademark laws.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b846-8\">That explanation does not address the four factors that courts must consider in determining whether injunctive relief is warranted. Instead, the district court denied Slep-Tone an injunction simply because it would have been difficult for the court to craft one that fits the circumstances of this case. That reason alone cannot support the denial of injunctive relief, and it was an abuse of discretion to deny Slep-Tone\u2019s request for an injunction without considering the proper factors. <em>See Klay v. United Healthgroup, Inc., </em>376 F.3d 1092, 1096 (11th Cir.2004) (\u201cA district court abuses its discretion if it applies an incorrect legal standard [or] follows improper procedures in making [its] determination.\u201d) (quoting <em>Martin v. Automobili Lamborghini Exclusive, Inc., </em>307 F.3d 1332, 1336 (11th Cir. 2002)). Accordingly, we vacate the district court\u2019s denial of a permanent injunction and remand with instructions to consider Slep-Tone\u2019s request under the correct standard. In doing so, we express no opinion about whether in light of those four factors an injunction should be entered. <em>See Macklin v. Singletary, </em>24 F.3d 1307, 1311 (11th Cir.1994) (\u201cBecause our scope of review is narrower and a district court\u2019s range of choice broader under the abuse of discretion standard, we should be more reluctant to address in the first instance issues to which that standard of review applies.\u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b846-10\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-11\">Slep-Tone contends that the district court erred by: (1) granting Donovan\u2019s Reefs motion to compel Slep-Tone\u2019s corporate representative\u2019s testimony about certain matters during a deposition and awarding Donovan\u2019s Reef attorney\u2019s fees; and (2) denying its motion for attorney\u2019s fees from the defendants based upon a discovery dispute. We review a district court\u2019s rulings on discovery matters, including sanctions and attorney\u2019s fees, for an abuse of discretion. <em>OFS Fitel, LLC v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"821\">*821</page-number><em>Epstein, Becker and Green, P.C., </em>549 F.3d 1344, 1360 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b847-5\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-6\">During discovery, counsel for Donovan\u2019s Reef deposed Kurt Slep, Slep-Tone\u2019s corporate representative under Fed.R.Civ.P. 30(b)(6). Donovan\u2019s Reefs attorney attempted to ask Slep what the factual basis for Slep-Tone\u2019s lawsuit was, and Slep refused to answer as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A6We\">Q: Why are you suing Donovan\u2019s Reef?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ALL\">A: Because they apparently met the criteria that they have unauthorized media shifted our content.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b847-7\">Q: Apparently?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b847-8\">A: I don\u2019t have the information....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b847-9\">Q: I\u2019m just trying to figure out why you\u2019re suing Donovan\u2019s Reef A: Because they would\u2019ve met the criteria that they have unauthorized\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b847-10\">Q: How do you know that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b847-11\">A: My attorney has all the information.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b847-12\">Slep-Tone\u2019s counsel: I think that is requesting our work product ... I am not going to produce any of that information.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b847-13\">Donovan\u2019s Reef moved to compel Slep\u2019s testimony about why Slep-Tone was suing it, and the magistrate judge granted that motion. The magistrate judge also concluded: \u201cPursuant to [Fed. R. Civ. P.] 37, I find that Slep-Tone\u2019s refusal to answer the deposition question was not substantially justified. Accordingly, I will award reasonable expenses incurred by Donovan\u2019s Reef in pursuit of [the motion to compel],\u201d including attorney\u2019s fees. Slep-Tone made a motion to set aside the magistrate judge\u2019s award of attorney\u2019s fees under Fed.R.Civ.P. 72(a), but the district court denied that motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-14\">Slep-Tone contends that the magistrate judge abused his discretion by granting the motion to compel because the information that Donovan\u2019s Reef sought from Slep was protected by the attorney-client privilege. The attorney-client privilege, however, protects only \u201cdisclosure of communications; it does not protect disclosure of the underlying facts by those who communicated with the attorney.\u201d <em>Upjohn Co. v. United States, </em>449 U.S. 383, 395, 101 S.Ct. 677, 685, 66 L.Ed.2d 584 (1981). Counsel for Donovan\u2019s Reef did not ask Slep about any communications he had with Slep-Tone\u2019s attorney; he asked only for the underlying facts that led to Slep-Tone\u2019s lawsuit. Those facts are not protected by the attorney-client privilege, and therefore the district court did not abuse its discretion in granting Donovan\u2019s Reefs motion to compel and awarding attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-15\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-16\">Slep-Tone also argues that the district court erred by denying its motion for attorney\u2019s fees under Fed.R.Civ.P. 37 after the court granted Slep-Tone\u2019s motion to compel discovery and allowed it to inspect the karaoke discs the defendants owned and the karaoke systems they used at their bars. Slep-Tone maintains that \u201c[t]he magistrate judge\u2019s ruling ... offers no recognized justification for refusing to enter an attorney[\u2019s] fee award.\u201d We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-17\">When the district court grants a motion to compel discovery, \u201cthe court must, after giving an opportunity to be heard, require the party or deponent whose conduct necessitated the motion, the party or attorney advising that conduct, or both to pay the movant\u2019s reasonable expenses incurred in making the motion, including attorney\u2019s fees.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 37(a)(5)(A). \u201c[T]he court must not order this payment,\u201d however, if: \u201c(i) the movant filed the motion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"822\">*822</page-number>before attempting in good faith to obtain the disclosure or discovery without court action; (ii) the opposing party\u2019s nondisclosure, response, or objection was substantially justified; or (iii) other circumstances make an award of expenses unjust.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b848-4\">The magistrate judge\u2019s order denying Slep-Tone\u2019s motion for attorney\u2019s fees does not mention Rule 37. It simply states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b848-5\">Notably, this case was resolved on the merits by the [district [cjourt by its final judgment entered July 27, 2012. In the interim, the parties have now litigated two separate motions for attorney[\u2019]s fees, and I have ruled on the motion filed by counsel for Donovan[\u2019]s Reef Lounge &amp; Package Store, Inc. and Green Glass Mall. I now conclude that this matter must come to an end. It is accordingly ORDERED as follows: ... The pending First Motion for Attorney Fees filed by Slep-Tone is DENIED.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Aca\">(Citations omitted.) The defendants contend that \u201cimplicitly ... [t]he magistrate judge\u2019s ruling represents a finding under Rule 37(a) (5)(A) (iii) that the continual inability by both parties to agree on anything makes an award of expenses unjust to either party.\u201d We are unwilling, however, to find that the magistrate judge \u201cimplicitly\u201d applied the correct legal standard when his decision does not cite to the applicable rule or track its language. And although we understand the desire to end the litigation between these parties, that desire alone is not a proper reason to deny Slep-Tone\u2019s motion for attorney\u2019s fees. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 37(a)(5)(A). It was an abuse of discretion to fail to discuss and apply the correct standard, and we vacate the order denying Slep-Tone\u2019s motion for attorney\u2019s fees and remand for the district court to decide the motion under the correct legal standard. <em>See Klay, </em>376 F.3d at 1096.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-6\">AFFIRMED IN PART, VACATED IN PART, AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b844-6\">. There is no allegation of infringement based on the content of the karaoke accompaniment tracks involved in this case, and we do not address that issue. <em>Cf. Dastar Corp. v.

The district court entered judgment in favor of the third defendant in the bench trial, finding that Slep-Tone did not prove that defendant used the SOUND CHOICE trademark.

At the time Slep-Tone filed its notice of appeal, there was not a final judgment within the meaning of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 because its claim against one defendant (who did not participate in the bench trial and who is not a party to this appeal) had been dismissed without prejudice. <em>See Ryan v. Occidental Petroleum Corp., </em>577 F.2d 298, 302-03 (5th Cir. 1978) (holding that a partial adjudication on the merits followed by a voluntary dismissal without prejudice of the remaining claims is not a final judgment that gives rise to appellate jurisdiction); <em>see also Mesa v. United States, </em>61 F.3d 20, 21-22 (11th Cir.1995) (same). We have jurisdiction over this appeal, however, because the district court later dismissed with prejudice all of Slep-Tone\u2019s claims against that defendant, which terminated the litigation and \u201dcure[d] [the] premature notice of appeal.\u201d <em>Robinson v.
