Davis, federal prisoner # 80388-008, was convicted by a jury of conspiracy to distribute 50 grams or more of cocaine base in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846. The district court\u2019s sentence of 360 months in prison was later reduced to 262 months. Davis now appeals the dismissal of his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 petition challenging his conviction and sentence. Davis challenges the validity of our decision in <em>Reyes-Requena v. United States, </em>243 F.3d 893 (5th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b313-22\">We review a district court\u2019s dismissal of a \u00a7 2241 petition de novo. <em>Padilla v. United States, </em>416 F.3d 424, 425 (5th Cir. 2005). A federal prisoner who seeks to challenge the legality of his conviction or sentence must generally file a \u00a7 2255 motion. <em>Id. </em>at 425-26. However, if the federal prisoner can show that \u00a7 2255 is \u201cin<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>adequate or ineffective,\u201d he may challenge the legality of his conviction or sentence in a \u00a7 2241 petition. \u00a7 2255(e); <em>see Reyes-Requena, </em>248 F.3d at 901.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-4\">Davis has not shown that his claims are \u201cbased on a retroactively applicable Supreme Court decision establishing that he may have been convicted of a nonexistent offense ... that was foreclosed by circuit law at the time when the claim should have been raised in [his] trial, appeal, or first \u00a7 2255 motion.\u201d <em>Reyes-Requena, </em>248 F.3d at 904. Further, his challenge to Reyes-Requena is unavailing: One panel of this court may not overrule another panel absent an intervening en banc decision of this court or a decision of the Supreme Court, even if the panel disagrees with the prior panel\u2019s holding. <em>In re Entringer Bakeries, Inc., </em>548 F.3d 344, 348-49 (5th Cir.2008). Accordingly, the district court\u2019s judgment dismissing Davis\u2019s \u00a7 2241 petition is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b313-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
