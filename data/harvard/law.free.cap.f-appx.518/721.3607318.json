The government filed a motion to dismiss Alers\u2019s appeal, based on the sentence appeal waiver in Alers\u2019s plea agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-21\">The sentence appeal waiver is enforceable, as the district court specifically questioned him about the waiver during his plea colloquy, and none of the waiver\u2019s exceptions apply. The Government\u2019s motion to dismiss the appeal of Alers\u2019s sentence pursuant to the appeal waiver in Appellant\u2019s plea agreement is GRANTED. <em>United States v. Bushert, </em>997 F.2d 1343, 1351 (11th Cir.1993) (sentence appeal waiver will be enforced if it was made knowingly and voluntarily); <em>United States v. Grinard-Henry, </em>399 F.3d 1294, 1296 (11th Cir.2005) (waiver of the right to appeal includes waiver of the right to appeal difficult or debatable legal issues or even blatant error).</p>\n<p id=\"b747-22\">Alers\u2019s appeal of the district court\u2019s denial of his motion to return his property falls beyond the scope of the written waiver in his plea agreement. However, based on Alers\u2019s clear indication that he is appealing only his sentence, not the validity of his guilty plea, we summarily affirm the district court\u2019s denial of the motion. We remand for the limited purpose of correcting the judgment to reflect the offense that Alers was indicted for, mail fraud conspiracy in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1341,1349.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-23\">DISMISSED IN PART; AFFIRMED IN PART; LIMITED REMAND FOR <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"722\">*722</page-number>THE PURPOSE OF CORRECTING THE JUDGMENT.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
