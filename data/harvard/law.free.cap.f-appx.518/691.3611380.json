Dunlop contends that the administrative law judge erred by finding that CWS was not disabled within the meaning of the Social Security Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-8\">CWS was born with a missing middle finger on her right hand and had mental impairments that were characterized as separation anxiety and an adjustment disorder. Dunlop applied for supplemental security income benefits on behalf of CWS, but the application was denied. Dunlop requested a hearing before an ALJ, who found that CWS was not disabled and was not entitled to benefits. She then filed a complaint in federal district court, where a magistrate judge recommended affirming the ALJ\u2019s decision. The district court adopted the magistrate judge\u2019s report and recommendation. This is Dunlop\u2019s appeal.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b718-11\">\u201cWe review the ALJ\u2019s decision to determine if it is supported by substantial evidence and based on proper legal standards.\u201d <em>Crawford v. Comm\u2019r of Soc. Sec., </em>363 F.3d 1155, 1158 (11th Cir.2004) (quoting <em>Lewis v. Callahan, </em>125 F.3d 1436, 1439 (11th Cir.1997)). \u201cSubstantial evidence is more than a scintilla and is such relevant evidence as a reasonable person would accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Lewis, </em>125 F.3d at 1439).</p>\n<p id=\"b718-12\">To determine whether a minor child is disabled, the ALJ must follow a three-step sequential process, considering whether the child: (1) is engaged in \u201csubstantial gainful activity\u201d; (2) has a medically determinable \u201csevere\u201d impairment or combination of impairments; and (3) has an impairment or combination of impairments that meets, medically equals, or functionally equals the severity of an impairment listed in the Code of Federal Regulations. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.924. The ALJ applied that three-step process, concluding that CWS had not engaged in substantial gainful activity, her impairments were \u201csevere,\u201d but her combination of impairments did not meet, medically equal, or functionally equal the severity of a listed impairment.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-13\">Dunlop contends that the ALJ erred by finding that: (1) CWS\u2019s mental impairment was not medically equal to a listed impairment; and (2) CWS\u2019s combi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"693\">*693</page-number>nation of impairments was not functionally equal to a listed impairment. As to the first contention, substantial evidence supports the ALJ\u2019s determination that CWS\u2019s mental impairment was not medically equal to a listed impairment. Various medical reports noted that CWS behaved appropriately for her age and two physicians concluded that her impairments, although severe, did not meet or medically equal the severity of a listed impairment. Dunlop points to the report of a social worker and a physician who conducted a mental health evaluation of CWS in support of her contention that the ALJ\u2019s conclusion was erroneous. But the existence of evidence that is arguably inconsistent with the ALJ\u2019s conclusion is not grounds for reversal. <em>See Crawford, </em>363 F.3d at 1158-59 (\u201cEven if the evidence preponderates against the ALJ\u2019s decision, we must affirm the decision so long as it is supported by substantial evidence.\u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b719-4\">As to Dunlop\u2019s second contention, to determine whether CWS\u2019s impairments functionally equal a listed impairment the ALJ must assess how CWS functions in six \u201cdomains\u201d: (1) acquiring and using information; (2) attending and completing tasks; (3) interacting and relating with others; (4) moving about and manipulating objects; (5) caring for self; and (6) health and physical well-being. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.926a(b)(l). The ALJ evaluated the six domains and concluded that CWS had \u201cno limitation\u201d in four of them and \u201ca less than marked limitation\u201d in two of them: (1) moving about and manipulating objects; and (2) health and physical well-being.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-6\">Dunlop contends that the ALJ erred by failing to conclude that CWS had \u201cmarked\u201d or \u201cextreme\u201d limitations in four of the domains: (1) attending and completing tasks; (2) moving about and manipulating objects; (3) caring for self; and (4) health and physical well-being. In support of her contention, Dunlop points to statements in medical reports and assessments by CWS\u2019s teachers that she claims suggest that CWS actually had significant limitations in those four domains. The ALJ\u2019s conclusion, however, is supported by substantial evidence that showed that CWS\u2019s mental impairments did not prevent her from functioning similarly to a normal child of her age and that despite the physical limitations of her right hand, she was able to use her left hand to perform most of the functions that an unimpaired child of her age is able to perform.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b719-7\">Regardless of the evidence that might suggest that CWS\u2019s impairments were more severe than the ALJ concluded, the record as a whole contains sufficient evidence for a reasonable person to accept the ALJ\u2019s conclusion that CWS\u2019s impairments did not meet, medically equal, or functionally equal a listed impairment. Accordingly, substantial evidence supports the ALJ\u2019s decision and we affirm. <em>See Crawford, </em>363 F.3d at 1158-59.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b718-9\">. Dunlop initially filed a <em>pro se </em>appeal on behalf of her minor daughter CWS. We <em>sua sponte </em>entered a stay and ordered the parties to show cause why Dunlop, a non-lawyer, could appear before us in a representative capacity. After receiving the parties' responses to the order to show cause, a single judge of this Court ordered the following issue to be carried with the case: \"Whether this Circuit should, in cases involving a minor child\u2019s claim for Supplemental Social Security disability benefits, recognize an exception to the general rule that a non-attorney parent may not represent a minor child in federal court.\" In that same order, however, the single judge appointed counsel to represent Dunlop. That made the issue of whether Dunlop may proceed without counsel moot, and we therefore do not address it. See <em>Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>273 F.3d 1330, 1336 (11th Cir.2001) (\"Any decision on the merits of a moot case or issue would be an impermissible advisory opinion.\") (quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b718-15\">As appointed counsel, Eric M. Cohen of Miami has performed admirably and rendered a service to appellant and to this Court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b719-5\">. Dunlop also contends that CWS\u2019s hand impairment functionally equals a listed impairment because it is a \"condition that is disabling at the time of onset, requiring continuing surgical management within 12 months after onset as a life-saving measure or for salvage or restoration of function, and such major function is not restored or is not expected to be restored within 12 months after onset of this condition.\u201d <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.926a(m)(2) (giving examples of impairments that functionally equal the listed impairments). That contention is not supported by the record because although CWS's surgeries improved the function of her right hand, there is no evidence that surgery was required to restore function.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
