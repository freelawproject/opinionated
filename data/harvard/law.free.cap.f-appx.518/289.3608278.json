The probation officer calculated a total offense level of 21, which included a 16-level enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(A)(ii) based on Camarillo Lopez\u2019s prior Texas conviction for burglary of a habitation with intent to commit theft. Camarillo Lopez objected to the 16-level enhancement on the grounds that Texas\u2019s burglary of a habitation offense does not meet the generic definition of burglary of a dwelling because a person may be convicted of burglary in Texas if he enters onto property without the consent of another person who has \u201ca greater right to possession of the property than the actor.\u201d Tex. Penal Code \u00a7 1.07(a)(35)(A). At sentencing, the district court overruled the objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-8\">Camarillo Lopez makes the same argument on appeal. According to Camarillo Lopez, because a person can be convicted of burglary of a habitation in Texas even if he has a legitimate right to possess the property, the Texas statute is broader than the generic definition of burglary of a dwelling. This argument is foreclosed by this court\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Morales-Mota, </em>in which we reasoned that <em>\u201c[mjerely </em>maintaining an inferior possesso-ry interest in a habitation does not extinguish the potential violence that may result when a person enters a habitation with intent to commit theft.\u201d 704 F.3d 410, 412 (5th Cir.2013). Thus, the district court did not err in applying the crime of violence enhancement in this case. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b316-13\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b316-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
