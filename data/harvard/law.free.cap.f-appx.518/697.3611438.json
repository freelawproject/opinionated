On appeal, Rouse argues that district court erred by declining to retroactively apply Amendment 750 and the reduced statutory penalties of the Fair Sentencing Act of 2010 (\u201cFSA\u201d) to reduce his sentence. For the reasons set forth below, we affirm the district court\u2019s denial of Rouse\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-10\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-11\">In 2001, Rouse was convicted of three counts of possession with intent to distribute crack cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1). The presentence investigation report (\u201cPSI\u201d) held him accountable for 16 grams of crack cocaine and, thus, he had a base offense level of 26 pursuant to \u00a7 2D1.1. However, as he had at least two prior felony convictions for a crime of violence or a controlled substance offense, the PSI classified him as a career offender pursuant to \u00a7 4B1.1. Because the statutory maximum penalty for his offenses was 40 years\u2019 imprisonment, his offense level was 34. He received a three-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3El.l(a) and (b)(2). Based on a total offense level of 31 and a criminal history category of VI, Rouse\u2019s guideline range was 188 to 235 months\u2019 imprisonment. The district court imposed a total sentence of 235 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-13\">In 2008, Rouse filed a motion for a sentence reduction pursuant to \u00a7 3582(c)(2), arguing that Amendment 706 lowered the base offense levels in \u00a7 2D1.1 for his crack cocaine offense. The district court denied the motion, explaining that Rouse was sentenced to 235 months\u2019 imprisonment because he qualified as a career offender. Thus, his base offense level remained 31 for sentencing purposes and, therefore, Amendment 706 did not reduce his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-14\">In 2012, Rouse, proceeding <em>pro se, </em>filed the instant motion to reduce his sentence, pursuant to \u00a7 3582(c)(2) and Amendment 750. According to Rouse, Amendment 750 made retroactive the FSA\u2019s reduced statutory penalties. Thus, application of Amendment 750 lowered the statutory maximum for his offenses and, as a result, his career offender guideline range was also lowered. Rouse further argued that the Supreme Court recognized in <em>Dorsey v. United States, </em>567 U.S.-, 132 S.Ct. 2321, 183 L.Ed.2d 250 (2012), that \u00a7 3582(c)(2) authorized district courts to retroactively apply the FSA to those sentenced before the FSA\u2019s effective date. Finally, citing to <em>Freeman v. United States, </em>564 U.S.-, 131 S.Ct. 2685, 180 L.Ed.2d 519 (2011), Rouse argued that, because \u00a7 2D1.1 was part of the analytical framework used by the district court to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"699\">*699</page-number>calculate his initial sentence, he was entitled to relief under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) and Amendment 750.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-5\">The district court denied Rouse\u2019s motion because, due to his status as a career offender, Amendment 750 did not lower his guideline range.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-7\">We review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s legal conclusions about the scope of its authority under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>United States v. Lawson, </em>686 F.3d 1317, 1319 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 133 S.Ct. 568, 184 L.Ed.2d 371 (2012). Section 3582(c)(2) provides that a court may reduce a defendant\u2019s sentence where the defendant is sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(l). Any reduction must be consistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission and must be based on a retroactively applicable guideline amendment listed in \u00a7 lB1.10(e). 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(l) &amp; comment, (backg\u2019d). According to \u00a7 1B1.10, a sentence reduction is unauthorized under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) where it does not have the effect of lowering a defendant\u2019s \u201capplicable guideline range.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(2)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b725-12\">Before the FSA was signed into law on August 3, 2010, distribution of 5 grams or more of crack cocaine triggered the application of a statutory mandatory minimum sentence of 5 years\u2019 imprisonment and a maximum sentence of 40 years\u2019 imprisonment. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(B)(iii) (2009). The FSA changed the crack-to-powder-co-eaine ratio from 100-to-l to about 18-to-l. <em>Dorsey, </em>567 U.S. at-, 132 S.Ct. at 2326. The FSA also amended the sentencing provisions in 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1) by raising from 5 grams to 28 grams the amount of crack cocaine necessary to trigger the 5-year mandatory minimum sentence and 40-year maximum sentence. Fair Sentencing Act of 2010, Pub.L. No. 111-220 \u00a7 2(a), 124 Stat. 2372 (2010). Under the FSA, where a defendant has distributed less than 28 grams of crack cocaine, a maximum sentence of 20 years\u2019 imprisonment applies. <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(C). On June 21, 2012, the Supreme Court held in <em>Dorsey </em>that the FSA\u2019s reduced statutory mandatory m\u00edni-mums apply to defendants who committed crack cocaine offenses before August 3, 2010, but were sentenced after the date the FSA went into effect. <em>Dorsey, </em>567 U.S. at-, 132 S.Ct. at 2326.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-16\">Amendment 750 to the Sentencing Guidelines, made retroactively applicable on November 1, 2011, by Amendment 759, makes permanent the temporary emergency Amendment 748, which lowered the base offense levels for particular crack cocaine quantities in \u00a7 2Dl.l(c), pursuant to the FSA. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G.App. C, Amend. 750, Reason for Amend, <em>and </em>U.S.S.G.App. C, Amend. 759. A career offender\u2019s offense level is determined by \u00a7 4Bl.l(b), rather than \u00a7 2D1.1. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4Bl.l(b). We have previously held that a career offender is not entitled to \u00a7 3582(c)(2) relief where a retroactive guideline amendment reduces his base offense level, but does not alter the sentencing range upon which his sentence was based. <em>See Lawson, </em>686 F.3d at 1320. In <em>Lawson, </em>we rejected a defendant\u2019s argument that, in light of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Freeman, </em>he was entitled to a sentence reduction based on \u00a7 3582(c)(2) and Amendment 750, notwithstanding his sentence being based on the career offender guideline. <em>Id. </em>at 1319-21. In <em>Freeman, </em>the question before the Supreme Court was whether defendants who entered into Fed.R.Crim.P. 11(c)(1)(C) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number>plea agreements were eligible for \u00a7 3582(c)(2) relief. 564 U.S. at-, 131 S.Ct. at 2690. We determined that neither the plurality opinion nor Justice Sotoma-yor\u2019s concurrence in <em>Freeman </em>addressed defendants who were assigned a base offense level under one guideline section, but who were ultimately assigned a total offense level and guideline range under \u00a7 4B1.1. <em>Lawson, </em>686 F.3d at 1321. Thus, we held that <em>Freeman </em>did not overrule our prior holding that a career offender was not entitled to \u00a7 3582(c)(2) relief where his guideline range was not lowered by a retroactive amendment. <em>Id. </em>Accordingly, we held that Lawson, a career offender, was not entitled to relief based on Amendment 750 and \u00a7 3582(c)(2), as his guideline range based on \u00a7 4B1.1 was not reduced by Amendment 750. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b726-6\">In <em>United States v. Berry, </em>we addressed the applicability of Amendment 750 and the FSA in the context of an \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceeding. 701 F.3d 374, 376-77 (11th Cir.2012). Berry was convicted of a crack cocaine offense and sentenced in 2002, and his initial guideline range was 360 months to life imprisonment, which was based on his status as a career offender under \u00a7 4Bl.l(b), not on the drug quantity tables in \u00a7 2D1.1. <em>Id. </em>at 376. In addition, because Berry had two prior felony drug convictions, he was subject to a statutory mandatory minimum life sentence under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A) (2009), and, as a result, his guideline sentence became life imprisonment, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5G1.1(c)(2). <em>Id. </em>at 376-377 &amp; n. 2. Berry filed a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion for a sentence reduction pursuant to Amendment 750, and the district court denied the motion. <em>Id. </em>at 376. On appeal, we affirmed, holding that the district court did not have the authority to grant Berry\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion because Amendment 750 had no effect on Berry\u2019s initial guideline range of 360 months to life imprisonment or his guideline sentence of life imprisonment. <em>Id. </em>at 377.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-8\">In addition, we rejected Berry\u2019s argument that he was eligible for a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) reduction under the FSA, determining that the FSA was not a guidelines amendment by the Sentencing Commission, but rather a statutory change by Congress. <em>Id. </em>Thus, it did not serve as a basis for a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) sentence reduction in Berry\u2019s case. <em>Id. </em>Even assuming that Berry could bring his FSA claim in a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion, we continued, his claim still failed because he was convicted and sentenced in 2002 and the FSA did not apply retroactively to his 2002 sentences. <em>Id. </em>We pointed out that the general savings clause in 1 U.S.C. \u00a7 109 provides that the repeal of a statute shall not have the effect of releasing or extinguishing any penalty incurred under that statute unless the repealing Act expressly so provides. <em>Id. </em>We then agreed with \u201cevery other circuit to address the issue\u201d that there was no evidence that Congress intended the FSA to apply to defendants who had been sentenced before the August 3, 2010, date of the FSA\u2019s enactment. <em>Id. </em>Finally, we distinguished the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Dorsey, </em>noting that <em>Dorsey </em>did not suggest that the FSA\u2019s new mandatory m\u00ednimums should apply to defendants, like Berry, who were sentenced before the FSA\u2019s effective date. <em>Id. </em>at 377-78.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-9\">In a footnote, we noted that, if Berry was resentenced under the FSA, his statutory maximum sentence would remain life imprisonment, and his offense level under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4Bl.l(b) would remain unchanged. <em>Id. </em>at 377 n. 3. Thus, we noted, even if Berry\u2019s statutory mandatory minimum was reduced to 10 years under the FSA, his guideline range under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5G1.1 would be 360 months to life imprisonment. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b727-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"701\">*701</page-number>After the parties filed their briefs in the instant appeal, we issued our decision in <em>United States v. Hippolyte, </em>which addressed whether the FSA applies retroactively to defendants, like Rouse, who were convicted and sentenced before its effective date. 712 F.3d 535, 542 (11th Cir. 2013). In <em>Hippolyte, </em>the defendant was sentenced in 1996 for an offense involving crack cocaine, and his sentence was based on the applicable 240-month statutory mandatory minimum, which became his guideline sentence under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5G1.1. <em>Id. </em>at 536-37. In 2011, Hippolyte moved for a sentence reduction based on \u00a7 3582(c)(2) and Amendment 750, and the district court denied the motion because he had received the statutory minimum sentence for his offenses. <em>Id. </em>On appeal, Hip-polyte argued that the FSA applies in \u00a7 3582 proceedings. <em>Id. </em>at 536-37. In affirming the district court\u2019s decision, we relied on <em>Berry, </em>holding that, even if Hip-polyte could raise a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) claim, the claim would fail because FSA did not apply retroactively to his 1996 sentence. <em>Id. </em>at 542. We reaffirmed our conclusion, in <em>Berry, </em>that the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Dorsey </em>did not suggest that the FSA should apply to defendants who were sentenced long before the FSA\u2019s effective date. <em>Id. </em>at 542. We explained that, because the FSA did not apply to Hippolyte\u2019s case, the statutory m\u00ednimums that applied were the ones that were in place at the time when he was sentenced in 1996. <em>Id. </em>at 542.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-4\">In the instant case, the district court correctly denied Rouse\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion because his guideline range was not lowered by Amendment 750. Amendment 750 reduced the base offense levels in \u00a7 2D1.1, not in \u00a7 4B1.1, and, contrary to Rouse\u2019s assertion, Amendment 750 did not make the FSA retroactive to defendants sentenced before its effective date. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G.App. C, Amend. 750; U.S.S.G.App. C, Amend. 748; <em>see also Lawson, </em>686 F.3d at 1321. Rouse was initially assigned a base offense level under \u00a7 2D1.1, but his total offense level and guideline range were based on \u00a7 4B1.1, not \u00a7 2D1.1, because he was a career offender. Thus, Amendment 750 did not alter the sentencing range upon which Rouse\u2019s sentence was based. <em>See Lawson, </em>686 F.3d at 1321. As <em>Freeman </em>did not abrogate our prior holding\u2014that defendants sentenced as career offenders, pursuant to \u00a7 4B1.1, were not entitled to \u00a7 3582(c)(2) sentence reductions where their guideline ranges were unaffected by a retroactive amendment\u2014the district court properly determined that \u00a7 3582(c)(2) did not authorize a reduction in Rouse\u2019s sentence. <em>Id. </em>at 1320-21.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-6\">Next, to the extent that Rouse argues that he is eligible for a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) reduction based on the FSA, his argument is foreclosed by our recent decisions in <em>Berry </em>and <em>Hippolyte. </em>It is noteworthy that in <em>Berry, </em>unlike the present case, application of the FSA\u2019s lower statutory penalties in Berry\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceedings would have had no effect on his guideline range as calculated under \u00a7 4Bl.l(b). <em>See Berry, </em>701 F.3d at 377 n. 3. In contrast, in the instant case, if the FSA\u2019s lower statutory penalties applied in Rouse\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceedings, it appears that his career offender guideline range would be reduced. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4Bl.l(b)(2)-(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b727-7\">Nevertheless, the logic of <em>Berry </em>supports the conclusion that the district court did not have the authority to grant Rouse\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion. The FSA is not an amendment to the Guidelines by the Sentencing Commission and, thus, it cannot serve as a basis for a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) sentence reduction in Rouse\u2019s case. <em>See Berry, </em>701 F.3d at 377. In any event, even assuming <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"702\">*702</page-number>that Rouse could raise his FSA claim in a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion, his claim fails because he was sentenced in 2001, before the August 3, 2010, effective date of the FSA, and, therefore, he cannot benefit from the FSA\u2019s lower statutory mandatory minimum provisions. <em>See Hippolyte, </em>712 F.3d at 542. Contrary to Rouse\u2019s assertion on appeal, <em>Dorsey </em>did not suggest that the FSA\u2019s new statutory penalties should apply to defendants who were sentenced before the FSA\u2019s effective date. <em>See Berry, </em>701 F.3d at 377-78 (providing that <em>\u201cDorsey </em>did not suggest that the FSA\u2019s new mandatory m\u00ednimums should apply to defendants, like Berry, who were sentenced long before the FSA\u2019s effective date\u201d); <em>Hippolyte, </em>712 F.3d at 542.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-4\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the district court\u2019s denial of Rouse\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
