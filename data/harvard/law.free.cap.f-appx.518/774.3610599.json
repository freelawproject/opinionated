The sole issue in this habeas corpus appeal is whether Mr. McGee\u2019s appellate counsel rendered ineffective assistance by failing to order a transcript of the voir dire proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-17\">Applying the deference required by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d), see <em>Harrington v. Richter, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 770, 786-87, 178 L.Ed.2d 624 (2011), we affirm the district court\u2019s denial of habeas relief. Even if we were to assume that counsel\u2019s failure to order the transcript of voir dire constituted deficient performance, Mr. McGee cannot show prejudice. As explained by the magistrate judge [D.E. 28 at 13-17] and the district court [D.E. 32 at 3-4], Mr. McGee\u2019s allegations do not demonstrate that his counsel would have been able to successfully argue on appeal that the trial court erred in not striking two jurors for cause. The district court therefore did not abuse its discretion in denying relief without requiring the state to produce the transcript and without holding an eviden-tiary hearing. <em>See, e.g., Chavez v. Sec\u2019y Fla. Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>647 F.3d 1057, 1073 (11th Cir.2011) (evidentiary hearing is not required if habeas petitioner\u2019s allegations fail to make out a claim).</p>\n<p id=\"b800-20\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
