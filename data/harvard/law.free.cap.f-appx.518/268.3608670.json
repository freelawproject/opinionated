His offense level was increased for a Texas conviction for burglary of a habitation that was deemed a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii) and was sentenced to 40 months of imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-24\">Alarcon contends that the Texas burglary of which he was convicted was not a crime of violence because Texas law too broadly defines the \u201cowner\u201d of a habitation as a person with merely \u201cgreater right to possession\u201d than the criminal actor. We review for plain error only because Alar-con raised the issue for the first time on appeal. <em>See United States v. Ramirez, </em>557 F.3d 200, 205 (5th Cir.2009). Alarcon must, at a minimum, show a forfeited error that was \u201cclear or obvious, rather than subject to reasonable dispute.\u201d <em>Puckett v. United States, </em>556 U.S. 129, 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b294-25\">We recently rejected an indistinguishable argument in <em>United States v. Joslin, </em>487 Fed.Appx. 139, 142-43 (5th Cir.2012), when we held that, notwithstanding the Texas theory of a \u201cgreater right to possession,\u201d a Texas conviction for burglary of a habitation constitutes the \u201cviolent felony\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>of generic burglary under the Armed Career Criminal Act (ACCA). The definition of \u201cviolent felony\u201d under the ACCA is the same as the definition of \u201ccrime of violence\u201d in \u00a7 2L1.2. <em>United States v. Najera-Mendoza, </em>683 F.3d 627, 631 n. 3 (5th Cir.2012). Accordingly, <em>Joslin, </em>though unpublished, is on point and sufficient to show that there was no plain or obvious error. <em>See Puckett, </em>556 U.S. at 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423. The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b294-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
