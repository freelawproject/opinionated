Ramirez-Gonzalez argues that his sentence is unreasonable. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-8\">The district court did not abuse its discretion. In response to Ramirez-Gonzalez\u2019s argument that his criminal history category overrepresented the seriousness of his prior convictions, the district court found that many of Ramirez-Gonzalez\u2019s convictions were traffic-related and reduced Ramirez-Gonzalez\u2019s criminal history from category VI to category V. Ramirez-Gonzalez sought a sentence at the low end of his revised advisory guideline range of 70 to 87 months, but the district court reasonably determined that a sentence of 72 months would best address the nature and circumstances of Ramirez-Gonzalez\u2019s offense and his history and characteristics, provide adequate punishment, and encourage respect for the law. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). Ramirez-Gonzalez had been a lawful permanent resident of the United States until he was convicted in a Georgia court of aggravated assault, battery, cruelty to children, making terroristic threats, criminal trespass, hindering law enforcement, and several traffic offenses and deported in 2010. And he had an extensive criminal history that included possession of marijuana, theft by shoplifting, driving under the influence, and giving false information to law enforcement. Ramirez-Gonzalez\u2019s sentence, which is well below his maximum statutory sentence of 20 years of imprisonment, is reasonable. <em>See United States v. Gonzalez, </em>550 F.3d 1319, 1324 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b686-10\">We AFFIRM Ramirez-Gonzalez\u2019s sentence.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
