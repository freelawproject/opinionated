He argues that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>district court should have granted his motion to dismiss because he was not indicted within 30 days of his arrest, as required by the Speedy Trial Act. We review the district court\u2019s factual findings regarding a Speedy Trial Act motion for clear error and its legal conclusions de novo. <em>United States v. De La Pena-Juarez, </em>214 F.3d 594, 597 (5th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b309-5\">Although the Speedy Trial Act generally does not apply when a defendant is detained on civil deportation charges, Hernandez seeks to invoke the \u201cruse exception,\u201d which is applicable only if a defendant establishes \u201cthat the primary or exclusive purpose of the civil detention was to hold him for future criminal prosecution.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 598. He asserts that he was not indicted within 30 days after immigration officials internally slated him for possible prosecution. Our review of the record and the testimonies presented at the evidentiary hearing supports the district court\u2019s finding that the ruse exception was not applicable in this case. The district court therefore properly denied his motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-6\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b308-6\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
