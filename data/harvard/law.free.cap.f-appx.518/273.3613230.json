Terry argues that his 18-month sentence is unreasonable because the district court relied on a prohibited sentencing factor, his need for a support system and a place to live, to impose or lengthen the sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-25\">Because Terry did not object to the reasonableness of his sentence based upon the district court\u2019s reference to his homelessness/rehabilitative needs, our review of that issue is limited to plain error. <em>See United States v. Garza, </em>706 F.3d 655, 661-63 (5th Cir.2013). In <em>Tapia v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 131 S.Ct. 2382, 2393, 180 L.Ed.2d 357 (2011), the Supreme Court held in the context of an appeal from an initial sentencing that a district court \u201cmay not impose or lengthen a prison sentence to enable an offender to complete a treatment program or otherwise to promote rehabilitation.\u201d We have now concluded that the holding in <em>Tapia </em>applies with equal force in the context of a revocation sentencing. <em>Garza, </em>706 F.3d at 658-61.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-28\">The district court in this case stated that an 18-month sentence was proper because it would afford adequate deterrence, protect the public, and give Terry, who was homeless, a support system and a place to live. This statement was the district court\u2019s sole remark regarding Terry\u2019s par<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>ticular needs. As the record does not indicate that the district court imposed or lengthened Terry\u2019s prison term for the purpose of making him eligible for any rehabilitative program, no <em>Tapia </em>error occurred. <em>See United States v. Receskey, </em>699 F.3d 807, 811-12 (5th Cir.2012). Even if the district court\u2019s mention of Terry\u2019s need for a support system and a place to live could be construed as a reliance on his rehabilitative needs in imposing sentence, there is no error. In light of the district court\u2019s statement that it imposed the sentence to provide adequate deterrence and to protect the public, the record does not indicate that Terry\u2019s need for treatment was a dominant factor in the court\u2019s sentencing analysis. <em>See Garza, </em>706 F.3d at 659-63; <em>Receskey, </em>699 F.3d at 812. Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b299-20\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
