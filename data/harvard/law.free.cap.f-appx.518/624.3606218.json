In addition to raising several constitutional issues, he argues that we have jurisdiction over his petition because the good moral character determination was a factual finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-19\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-20\">Chavez Roman, a native citizen of Bolivia, entered the United States on a tourist visa in 1999. At that time, he was married to a woman from Bolivia. Chavez Roman divorced his first wife in 2004 and married his second wife, a native of Cuba who, in 2005, had adjusted her status to become a permanent resident of the United States. In 2006, Chavez Roman applied to have his immigration status adjusted to that of a permanent resident based on his wife\u2019s permanent resident status. Authorities denied his application in 2007, after finding, based on his second wife\u2019s statements, that he had entered into the marriage for the purpose of circumventing immigration laws. Chavez Roman had a child in the United States with his first wife in 2008.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-21\">Chavez Roman was served with a Notice To Appear (\u201cNTA\u201d) in 2010 alleging that he had remained beyond the expiration of his visa, and he subsequently applied for cancellation of removal under INA \u00a7 240A(b), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(b), arguing that his U.S.-born child would suffer exceptional and extremely unusual hardship if he was deported. The government moved the IJ to pretermit his application based on the previous marriage fraud finding. The IJ ultimately granted the motion in 2011, noting that, based on the apparent fraud concerning his second marriage, Chavez Roman could not establish the good moral character needed to obtain relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-22\">He appealed, but the BIA dismissed his appeal in 2012, noting that he did not demonstrate that he possessed the required good moral character under \u201cINA \u00a7 101(f), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(f).\u201d Chavez Roman then filed the instant petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-23\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-24\">We have jurisdiction to determine our own jurisdiction and are required to do so <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>whenever jurisdiction may be lacking. <em>Chacon-Botero v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>427 F.3d 954, 956 (11th Cir.2005); <em>Patel v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>334 F.3d 1259, 1262 (11th Cir. 2003). We review whether we have subject matter jurisdiction <em>de novo. Arias v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>482 F.3d 1281, 1283 (11th Cir.2007) (citing <em>Brooks v. Ashcroft, </em>283 F.3d 1268, 1272 (11th Cir.2002)). When appropriate, constitutional challenges are reviewed <em>de novo. Lonyem v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>352 F.3d 1338, 1341 (11th Cir.2003). We lack jurisdiction to consider procedural due process claims not raised before the BIA, because they are subject to the exhaustion requirement of INA \u00a7 242(d)(1), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d)(1), which is jurisdictional. <em>Amayar-Artunduaga v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>463 F.3d 1247, 1249-51 (11th Cir. 2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b651-5\">Before considering the merits of a petition, \u201cwe must first consider whether we have subject matter jurisdiction to hear the petition at all.\u201d <em>Resendiz-Alcaraz v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>383 F.3d 1262, 1266 (11th Cir.2004). A petition for review must be filed within 30 days after the date of the final order of removal. INA \u00a7 242(b)(1), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(1). This deadline is mandatory and jurisdictional and is not subject to equitable tolling. <em>Dakane v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>399 F.3d 1269, 1272 n. 3 (11th Cir. 2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b651-6\">Even where an alien files a timely petition for review, there are certain orders that we do not have jurisdiction to review, pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(b)(i). This section bars, in relevant part, appellate courts from reviewing denials of discretionary relief related to cancellation of removal under INA \u00a7 240A(b), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b, or any other decision over which the Attorney General or Secretary of Homeland Security is granted discretion, other than asylum. INA \u00a7 242(a)(2)(B)(ii), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii). However, \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D) operates to permit review of certain constitutional claims or questions of law. INA \u00a7 242(a)(2)(D), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D).</p>\n<p id=\"b651-8\">Under INA \u00a7 240A(b), the Attorney General has the discretion to cancel the removal of a non-permanent resident if that alien: (1) has continuous physical presence in the United States for ten years; (2) is of good moral character; (3) has not committed certain criminal offenses; and (4) shows that his citizen or legal permanent resident qualifying relative will suffer \u201cexceptional and extremely unusual\u201d hardship. INA \u00a7 240A(b), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b651-9\">Section 101(f) of the INA regarding \u201cgood moral character\u201d provides several specific or \u201cper se\u201d offenses \u2014 such as being a habitual drunkard \u2014 which preclude the IJ from finding that the alien has good moral character. <em>See </em>INA \u00a7 101(f), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(f). That section also has a \u201ccatchall\u201d provision which states that \u201cany person is not within any of the [per se categories] shall not preclude a finding that for other reasons such person is or was not of good moral character.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We have held that the BIA\u2019s denial of cancellation of removal under \u00a7 240A based on the catchall good moral character provision is discretionary because the decision \u201cis a matter of judgment not tightly controlled by formula or by hard rules.\u201d <em>Jimenez-Galicia v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>690 F.3d 1207, 1210 (11th Cir.2012), <em>petition for cert. filed, </em>81 U.S.L.W. 3414 (U.S. Jan 10, 2013) (No. 12-846). We also intimated in <em>Jimenez-Galicia </em>that a decision about an alien\u2019s good moral character based on one of the per se categories <em>might </em>be non-discretionary. <em>Id. </em>at 1210 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b651-10\">Neither the IJ nor the BIA explicitly stated under which part of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(f) it was resolving the question of Chavez Roman\u2019s good moral character. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>Because we are not certain which provision applies, we are unable to determine if we have jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s order dismissing Chavez Roman\u2019s appeal from the IJ\u2019s ruling. Accordingly, we grant the petition for review and remand the case to the BIA for it to remand the case to the IJ with instructions that the IJ clarify whether the good moral character determination was made pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(f) or the catchall provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-4\">PETITION GRANTED and case REMANDED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
