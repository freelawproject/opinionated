We hold that it is and reverse the Court of Appeals.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b622-6\">The pertinent facts of these proceedings can be found in Justice Kavanagh\u2019s opinion. We write separately because we do not agree with his analysis of the law applicable to these cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-7\">Justice Kavanagh finds that this Court\u2019s recent decision, <em>State ex rel Wayne County Prosecutor v Diversified Theatrical Corp, </em>396 Mich 244; 240 NW2d 460 (1976), strictly limits the application of the abatement act to houses of prostitution, assignation or lewdness where sexual acts are committed. We do not agree, and read that decision as standing solely for the proposition that motion picture theatres may not be enjoined from showing obscene films under the abatement act.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>MCL 600.3801; MSA 27A.3801 provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b623-4\"><em>\"Any building, </em>vehicle, boat, aircraft <em>or place used for the purpose of lewdness, assignation or prostitution </em>or gambling, <em>or used by, </em>or kept for the use of <em>prostitutes </em>or other disorderly persons, * * * is hereby declared a nuisance and * * * shall be enjoined and abated as hereinafter provided, and as provided in the court rules. Any person, or his servant, agent or employee who shall own, lease, conduct or maintain any building, vehicle or place used for any of the purposes or by any of the persons above set forth or where any of the acts above enumerated are conducted, permitted or carried on, is guilty of a nuisance.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b623-5\">The difficulty in interpreting the meaning of the statutory phrase, \"lewdness, assignation or prostitution\u201d as used in this act, and determining its applicability to the facts before us, stems from dictum in <em>Diversi\u00f1ed </em>which states that this statute \"* * *. was intended to apply to houses of prostitution * * *\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and that lewdness and assignation are both synonymous with prostitution.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We do not accept this dictum as controlling these cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-6\"><em>Diversi\u00f1ed </em>involved an attempt to apply the abatement act to motion picture theatres showing obscene films. The opinion held that the statute was not intended to apply to motion picture theatres where sexual acts are not committed but are portrayed on the screen. In reaching that decision the Court reviewed decisions of other jurisdictions involving apparently similar statutes to determine whether \"obscenity\u201d fell within the purview of the statutory phrase \"lewdness, assignation or prostitution\u201d, and found it did not. In the course of its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>review, which appears to have focused primarily on whether obscenity is lewdness, the Court quoted an Illinois appellate court decision which stated that lewdness could not be equated with obscenity, but must be synonymous with prostitution, when the former term was found in a statute prohibiting the use of premises for the purpose of lewdness, assignation or prostitution. In addition, the Illinois court stated, after noting other possible, innocent definitions of assignation, that this term also was synonymous with prostitution.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b624-6\">We find that, in order to determine whether instances of accosting and soliciting for purposes of prostitution constitute prohibited conduct under MCL 600.3801; MSA 27A.3801, we must focus on the meaning of the statutory term \"assignation\u201d, rather than focusing on the term \"lewdness\u201d as Justice Kavanagh does, and determine whether assignation is synonymous with the statutory term \"prostitution\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-7\">In seeking to determine the definition of the statutory term \"assignation\u201d, we note that this Court has long recognized that the primary rule governing the interpretation of statutes is to ascertain and give effect to the intention of the Legislature and that in this process, \"effect must be given, if possible, to every word, sentence and section\u201d. <em>Grand Rapids v Crocker, </em>219 Mich 178, 182; 189 NW 221 (1922). Consequently, if the term \"assignation\u201d has a meaning distinct from the term \"prostitution\u201d, we must give effect to that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>meaning in order to effectuate the Legislature\u2019s intention in enacting this statute.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b625-6\">Assignation is not statutorily defined, and a review of Michigan case law has disclosed no precedent which has finally and authoritatively defined that term. We read the definition of this term found in <em>Diversified </em>as dictum and hold it does not control the instant cases which do not involve the showing of obscene films but do involve conduct substantially connected with prostitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-7\">Because we find no statutory definition or controlling judicial definition of this term, we comply with the legislative directive to construe words used in statutes according to common and approved usage,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and look to the common meaning of the term \"assignation\u201d to resolve the question before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-8\"><em>Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary Unabridged </em>(1966 ed), p 132, defines assignation as \"an appointment of time and place for a meeting [especially] for illicit sexual relations\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-9\"><em>The Random House Dictionary of the English Language: The Unabridged Edition </em>(1969 ed), p 90, defines the term as \"an appointment for a meeting, [especially] a lover\u2019s secret rendezvous; a lover\u2019s tryst\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-10\">Finally, the term \"assignation\u201d is given the following definition, in 6A CJS, Assignation, p 582:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b625-11\">\"The word is defined as meaning an appointment of time and place for meeting or interview; used chiefly of love interviews and now commonly in a bad sense.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b626-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>Consistent with these definitions, we find that the term assignation as used in the abatement act encompasses instances of accosting and soliciting for purposes of prostitution because such instances involve the making of an appointment for the purpose of prostitution.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> We find that limiting this definition to the making of an appointment <em>for the purpose of prostitution </em>is consistent with the apparent legislative intent to eliminate the use of property in connection with prostitution; avoids prohibiting innocent conduct which is of the nature of assignation; and is consistent with the rule of <em>noscitur a </em>sociis.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b627-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed and the decision of the trial court reinstated in each of these cases.</p>\n<judges id=\"b627-4\">Coleman, C.J., and Williams and Fitzgerald, JJ., concurred with Ryan, J.</judges>\n<author id=\"b627-5\">Kavanagh, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AC5\"><em>(for affirmance). </em>The question in these consolidated cases is whether proof that soliciting and accosting occurred on the premises is sufficient to regulate a place as a public nuisance under the \"red light abatement act\u201d, MCL 600.3801; MSA 27A.3801. <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The trial court in each case held that it is, and the Court of Appeals reversed. We affirm the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-6\">Each cause was commenced upon a complaint filed by the Wayne County Prosecutor\u2019s office. A lengthy trial was held in <em>Levenburg. </em>There was testimony that prostitutes frequented Anderson\u2019s Gardens, a bar located in the City of Detroit, and solicited sexual acts to be performed elsewhere. The trial court made findings of fact that within 30 days prior to the filing of the complaint, soliciting and accosting had occurred on the premises. The court also found that during the period from January 1, 1971 to July 1, 1974, over 160 arrests for soliciting and accosting on the premises were made. Based on these findings, the trial court found Anderson\u2019s Gardens to be a place used by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>prostitutes and used for the purpose of assignation, and thus subject to abatement under the statute, The court permanently enjoined the defendants from permitting the bar to be used for the purpose of assignation.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-5\">On appeal, the Court of Appeals reversed. The trial court\u2019s interpretation of \" 'assignation\u2019 as including the making of an appointment for purposes of prostitution, and thus including the act of soliciting for prostitution\u201d was held to be erroneous. 75 Mich App 90, 93; 254 NW2d 797 (1977). Relying on this Court\u2019s opinion in <em>State ex rel Wayne County Prosecutor v Diversified Theatrical Corp, </em>396 Mich 244; 240 NW2d 460 (1976), the Court held that the premises must be a house of prostitution in order for the abatement act to be applied properly, and a bar wherein no sexual acts for profit occur is not such a place.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-6\"><em>Richmond </em>involves an appeal from the trial court\u2019s denial of defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment. The defendant argued in support of the motion that the Willis Show Bar, holder of a Class C liquor license, is not a \"house of prostitution\u201d as the term was used in <em>Diversi\u00f1ed', supra. </em>The trial court rejected the argument, finding the act applicable to places where acts of soliciting and accosting occur. A majority of the Court of Appeals reversed, holding \"the Willis Show Bar is not a house of prostitution\u201d. 77 Mich App 41, 45; 257 NW2d 759 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b628-7\">In <em>Diversi\u00f1ed, supra, </em>this Court addressed the scope of the abatement statute in the course of determining the question of whether the statute was intended to apply to motion picture theatres exhibiting obscene movies. Citing several decisions in other states,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> we found that the statute is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>\" 'directed to the abatement of * * * houses of lewdness, assignation, or prostitution\u2019 \u201d, and that the terms \"lewdness, assignation, and prostitution\u201d are synonymous. 396 Mich 248-249. Accordingly, we held that the abatement statute \"was intended to apply to <em>houses of prostitution </em>and not motion picture theatres <em>where sexual acts are not committed </em>but are portrayed on the screen\u201d. 396 Mich 246 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b629-4\">Appellant now urges us to give a narrow reading to the <em>Diversi\u00f1ed </em>opinion, and apply the abatement act to bars where sexual acts are not committed but are solicited for performance elsewhere. Two basic arguments are advanced in support. It is asserted that a \"house of prostitution\u201d is not limited to premises where sexual acts are committed. Rather, the term should be defined broadly and equated with the definition of a \"disorderly house\u201d found in <em>People v Thrine, </em>218 Mich 687, 691; 188 NW 405 (1922):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b629-5\">\" 'A disorderly house, in its restricted sense, is a house in which people abide, or to which they resort, disturbing the repose of the neighborhood; but in its more enlarged sense it includes bawdy-houses, common gaming-houses, and places of like character, to which people promiscuously resort for purposes injurious to the public morals, or health, or convenience, or safety. Nor is it essential that there be any disorder or disturbance in the sense that it disturbs the public peace or the quiet of the neighborhood. It is enough that the acts there done are contrary to law and subversive of public morals, and the result is the same whether the unlawful acts are denounced by the common law or by statute.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b630-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>As is apparent from this definition, a house of prostitution, or bawdy-house, is a disorderly house, but not all disorderly houses are houses of prostitution. <em>\u201dA house of prostitution </em>is one in which a prostitute plies her trade\u201d. 73 CJS, Prostitution, \u00a7 1, p 226. Prostitution, the trade of the prostitute, commonly refers to the performance of sexual acts for compensation. Soliciting and accosting and prostitution itself are different and distinct concepts, MCL 750.448; MSA 28.703.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Recognizing the distinction customarily drawn, the Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals recently held a complaint alleging the defendant \"did prostitute herself by making an offer to indiscriminate lewdness\u201d did not charge prostitution, <em>Holloway v Birmingham, </em>55 Ala App 568; 317 So 2d 535 (Ct Crim App, 1975), <em>cert den </em>294 Ala 759; 317 So 2d 541 (1975). The Court stated, 55 Ala App 574:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b630-6\">\"Here appellant <em>made a solicitation to perform </em>a natural and an unnatural sex act for a named sum of money. The proposition got no further than that. There was no bedroom affair, no disrobing, no touching of the bodies, no money paid, and no sexual activity. In short, <em>the crime of prostitution was not committed.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b630-7\">We hold that in order to constitute a \"house of prostitution\u201d a place must be one in which sexual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>acts are committed for compensation. Premises where soliciting and accosting but no sexual acts occur are not houses of prostitution and cannot be closed pursuant to the abatement statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-5\">Appellant also argues that limiting the applicability of the abatement statute to houses of prostitution, and requiring that sexual acts occur on the premises, ignores the effect the Legislature intended to give the terms \"lewdness\u201d and \"assignation\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-6\">These terms are not defined in the statute. In <em>Diversi\u00f1ed </em>we ascribed to those words a meaning we found \"clear in light of the history and purpose of these [abatement] statutes\u201d.. 396 Mich 250. Citing <em>State, ex rel Murphy v Morley, </em>63 NM 267; 317 P2d 317 (1957), we said that the statutory term \" lewdness\u2019, applies only to acts of assignation or prostitution\u201d.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> 396 Mich 248-249. Similarly, in accordance with the rule of <em>noscitur a sociis, </em>we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>read both \"lewdness\u201d and \"assignation\u201d as being synonymous with prostitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-4\">Appellant claims that, despite the definition in <em>Diversified, </em>\"lewdness\u201d cannot be wholly limited by the meaning of the term \"prostitution\u201d. Rather, lewdness should be given a meaning which comprehends the activity of soliciting and accosting. It is argued that solicitation is inextricably associated with prostitution and is a cognate activity<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> to which the abatement statute should properly be applied.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-5\">We disagree, for we are satisfied that such argument misperceives the nature of \"cognate\u201d activities. The cognate activities which could properly be embraced would have to be sexual acts of some sort.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-6\">In <em>Chicago v Geraci, </em>30 Ill App 699; 332 NE2d 487 (1975), an Illinois appellate court reached the question of whether a masturbatory massage parlor is a house of prostitution under the Illinois abatement statute. In determining that it was, the court assigned the following interpretation to the term \"lewdness\u201d, 30 Ill App 3d 704:</p>\n<p id=\"b632-7\">\"Although traditionally the term 'lewdness\u2019 is viewed as being broader than and including the term 'prostitution,\u2019 <em>(People v Lackaye, </em>348 Ill App 542; 109 NE2d 390 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>[1952]; <em>opinion adopted by Illinois Supreme Court, </em>1 Ill 2d 618; 116 NE2d 359 [1953]) <em>such terms refer to the same general class of activities which are normally associated with houses of prostitution </em>(or whatever such establishments may be called). <em>They are intended to designate and prohibit sex acts of whatever nature which are performed for money. \u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b633-4\">Solicitation for purposes of prostitution is not covered under the rubric of \"lewdness\u201d, as it is not a sexpal act. At most, solicitation is the offer to perform a sexual act for compensation. Establishments used to solicit or offer to perform elsewhere the acts covered by the statute cannot be closed pursuant to it. See <em>State ex rel Washtenaw County Prosecuting Attorney v Western Union Telegraph Co, </em>336 Mich 84; 57 NW2d 537 (1953).</p>\n<p id=\"b633-5\">In accordance with our opinion in <em>Diversi\u00f1ed, </em>we hold that the abatement statute applies only to houses of prostitution, assignation or lewdness, as places where sexual acts are committed.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-6\">The Court of Appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b633-7\">Levin, J., concurred with Kavanagh, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b622-8\"> We note that leave was granted in these cases for the limited purpose of deciding this issue. However, we acknowledge that a judgment for abatement in a prosecution of this nature cannot be rendered without a finding of knowledge of the accosting and soliciting on the part of the owners or operators of the place found to be a nuisance and their acquiescence in those activities.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-9\">Such a finding was made by the trial judge in the <em>Levenburg </em>case. No such finding has yet been made in the <em>Richmond </em>case because the trial has not yet taken place. The <em>Richmond </em>case is before us on an appeal from a denial of defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b623-7\"> 396 Mich 244, 246; 240 NW2d 460 (1976).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b623-8\"> 396 Mich 244, 249; 240 NW2d 460 (1976).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b624-8\"> 396 Mich 244, 249; 240 NW2d 460 (1976), citing <em>People v Goldman, </em>7 Ill App 3d 253; 287 NE2d 177, 178-179 (1972). <em>Goldman </em>involved an unsuccessful attempt to abate the display and dissemination of pornography and the promotion of a \"Swingers Club\u201d pursuant to a statute prohibiting the use of all buildings and places for the purposes of lewdness, assignation or prostitution.

In <em>Miami Health Studios, Inc v Miami Beach, </em>353 F Supp 593 (SD Fla, 1972), the court found that a similar statute prohibiting the maintenance or operation of any place for the purpose of lewdness, assignation, or prostitution was constitutionally infirm as the language employed was too vague and indefinite, and failed to inform reasonable men as to what conduct was prohibited. However, in <em>People v Goldman, </em>7 Ill App 3d 253; 287 NE2d 177 (1972), the Illinois appellate court observed that lewdness as used in the Illinois public nuisance act, which is quite similar to section 192-1 of the Municipal Code of Chicago, was in the disjunctive seriatim with the words 'prostitution and assignation,\u2019 so that its meaning must be determined by looking to the words with which it is associated. The court concluded that the legislature must have intended 'lewdness\u2019 to be interpreted as being synonymous with 'prostitution,\u2019 and therefore held that the statute was not too vague. (Accord, <em>Chicago v Geraci, </em>30 Ill App 3d 699; 332 NE2d 487 [1975].) In <em>Geraci, </em>the court adopted the same interpretation with respect to section 192-1 of the Municipal Code of Chicago. We agree with this interpretation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b631-9\">See, also, <em>State ex rel Faches v NDD, Inc, </em>228 NW2d 191 (Iowa, 1975) (holding the term \"lewdness\u201d, undefined in the Iowa abatement statute, to be vague).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b632-8\"> Appellant\u2019s argument is based on the following language used by the court in <em>Goldman, </em>fn 2 <em>supra, </em>255, and quoted in <em>Diversi\u00f1ed, </em>396 Mich 249:</p>\n<p id=\"b632-9\">\" 'To fix purpose, we must read text in context and if a word is known by the company it keeps, then \"lewdness\u201d is synonymous with prostitution.

The majority ruled, however, that <em>Sill </em>and other cases <em>(Tate </em>and <em>Bitonti</em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark><em>), </em>which sustained the seizure and sale of automobiles used to run numbers or mutuel betting tickets although no completed acts of gambling were shown to have occurred in them, did not announce a comprehensive rule permitting padlocking on proof of ancillary activity facilitating or effectuating but not amounting to the condemned activity.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b636-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>In <em>Western Union </em>it was sought to padlock a telegraph office on the ground that it had been \"used for the purpose of\u2019,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> \"in connection with\u201d or to facilitate or effectuate the condemned activity (gambling) elsewhere. An order of abatement was reversed although Western Union \"knew\u201d and \"acquiesced\u201d; it conceded that it transmitted daily over its wires offers to wager and money for wagers and pay-offs. This Court nevertheless held that because the condemned activity (gambling) did not entirely occur in the telegraph office and, in contrast with the automobile cases (where the drivers had betting slips in the car), the <em>proprietor </em>possessed nothing which it might not lawfully possess, the office could not be padlocked.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-5\">The concern manifested in <em>Western Union </em>for protecting the interests of persons not participating in the condemned activity appears also in <em>Maynard\u2019s </em>Petition<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> where the Court concluded that cigarette and candy vending machines and their contents owned by another were not subject to seizure for violation of the liquor laws by the owner of the premises where they were located. The Court declared that neither <em>Sill </em>nor <em>Martin </em><footnotemark>7</footnotemark> supported seizure on the theory that the presence of such machines contributed to the violation of the liquor laws by adding to the convenience of the customer. The Court saw no \"relation\u201d between their presence and the illegal sale of liquor.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-6\">The cases appear to fall into two general categories. The first category consists of those cases <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>where the condemned activity is engaged in solely by a person in lawful possession <em>(e.g., </em>as owner, lessee, bailee) of the property \u2014 the automobile cases, <em>Sill, Tate, Bitonti, </em>and <em>Martin, </em>and the prostitution case, Robinson.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The second category consists of those cases where unlawful activity is engaged in by patrons of what, except for that activity, is generally a lawful business \u2014 the telegraph office in <em>Western Union, </em>a dance hall in Schoonmaker,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and a resort in <em>Harding. </em><footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b637-4\">When the claim made is in the first category there is no need, under the statute <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> and the cases,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> to prove knowledge or participation by the owner of the property sought to be seized or padlocked. Where, however, it is sought to padlock a legitimate business because of the activities of patrons, the Court has required proof of knowledge and some degree of participation by the owner in condemned activity by patrons <em>on his premises.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b637-5\">In <em>Schoonmaker </em>where, as here, it was sought to padlock a place open to the public based on activity of patrons, the Court declared that the people must show that the proprietor\u2019s \"use bears a participating relation\u201d to activities of patrons <em>on his premises </em>condemned by the padlock act, and concluded that it had failed in that burden. The Court\u2019s analysis that the liquor was \"not used in the dance hall but secreted by patrons outside of the hall\u201d where it was consumed, is inconsistent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>with the view that although the condemned activity is committed off the premises a public place can nevertheless be padlocked, to say nothing of predicating padlocking on ancillary activity of patrons offering or agreeing to go outside to commit the condemned offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-5\">In <em>Harding </em>\u2014 the only reported case in the 60-odd year history of the statute<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> where a public place was padlocked based on the activities of patrons \u2014 there was evidence that the owner not only \"acquiesced\u201d but participated in the condemned activity by himself encouraging his employees to supply his underage customers with intoxicating liquor in his unlicensed establishment, and that customers were encouraged to engage, and had engaged, in the condemned activity by possessing and consuming intoxicating liquor on the premises.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>It is unprecedented to padlock a public place based on ancillary activity of patrons less than the completed offense condemned by the padlock act.

Many assignations do not involve prostitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-8\">The history of the red light abatement acts, however, sustains the consistent construction in this and other jurisdictions that the acts were designed to abate nuisances at houses or places where sexual acts occur; such abatement acts have been applied solely to commercial sexual activity.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b641-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>Even if one ignores that history, one cannot properly read place of assignation<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> to mean the place where the agreement for an assignation is made rather than the place where the agreed upon meeting for the agreed upon purpose is to occur.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-4\">The dictionary definitions recited by the Court do not support its conclusion. \"[A]n appointment * * * for a meeting\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark>, is, as <em>Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary Unabridged </em>explicitly states, the \"time and place\u201d where the meeting is to occur. The Court apparently reads \"an appointment of time and place\u201d as if it were \"appointing a time and place\u201d, concluding that the <em>\"making </em>of an appointment\u201d is itself an assignation.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-5\">Just as the place where a contract is to be performed and the place where it is entered into are generally different places, so, too, the appointed place for an assignation will often be a place other than the place where the appointment was made, <em>e.g., </em>such an appointment may be made by telephone or on a street corner.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>The place where the appointment for sexual purposes is agreed upon is a place of assignation only if the sexual act as well as the agreement is to or does occur at the same place. Where the agreement appoints another place for the sexual act, that place alone is the place of assignation; the mere agreement is not an assignation.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-6\">Further, accosting and soliciting, on which the Court\u2019s finding of assignation is based, is not, even in the Court\u2019s lexicon, assignation.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-7\">In apparent appreciation that its strained construction may invite application in contexts other than offering sex for <em>money </em>\u2014 e.g., persons meeting at work, a neighborhood or singles bar or some other location and agreeing to meet immediately or at another time at some place to engage in noncommercial sexual activity \u2014 the Court inconstantly turns full circle, acknowledges that the legislative purpose was to abate the use of premises and places for prostitution, and creatively limits \"assignation\u201d to agreements involving prostitution to avoid the prohibition of \"innocent\u201d conduct which is \"of the nature of assignation\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-8\">In <em>Harding </em>the Court used the terms \"lewdness\u201d and \"assignation\u201d correctly:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b642-9\">\"The place had a bad reputation in the community for lewdness and assignation. There was testimony tending to show <em>lewdness in talk </em>on the dance floor, <em>suggesting assignations in the adjacent rooms. </em>These rooms had the customary equipment of hotel bedrooms.\u201d <em>People ex rel Allegan Prosecuting Attorney v Harding, </em>343 Mich 41, 46-47; 72 NW2d 33 (1955) (emphasis supplied).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b642-10\">In sum, even if the term place of assignation is not limited \u2014 by the consistent construction of the red light abatement acts \u2014 to a place where sexual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>acts are committed in a commercial setting, it is\u2014 as a matter of ordinary English usage \u2014 the place of the appointment for sexual purposes, not the. place where the appointment is made.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b643-6\">I have considered whether the clause <em>\"kept for the use </em>of prostitutes or other disorderly persons\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> constitutes a separate basis for padlocking bars which include, among their patrons, prostitutes and their customers.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> To so conclude might re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>quire defining the word \"use\u201d as including ancillary activities other than completed acts of prostitution, gambling or illegal traffic in intoxicants, contrary to the history of disposition under this statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-6\">Since the Court does not rest decision on this clause of the padlock act and the trial judge in <em>Levenburg </em>made no finding that Anderson\u2019s Gardens was a place <em>\"kept for </em>the use of prostitutes\u201d and the record does not, in contrast with <em>Harding\u2022, </em>show that the owners here were themselves involved directly or through their employees in providing the illicit supply to their customers, there is no need in this dissenting opinion to consider whether the statute authorizes padlocking where, as in the cases from other jurisdictions cited by the Court to support its definition of \"assignation\u201d,<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> the owner is involved in providing the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>illicit supply which may be availed of off the premises.</p>\n<judges id=\"b645-4\">Blair IVIoody, Jr., J., took no part in the decision of these cases.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b634-6\"> <em>People ex rel Wayne Prosecuting Attorney v Sill, </em>310 Mich 570, 575; 17 NW2d 756 (1945).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b634-7\"> <em>State ex rel Washtenaw County Prosecuting Attorney v Western Union Telegraph Co, </em>336 Mich 84, 97; 57 NW2d 537 (1953).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b634-8\"> <em>People ex rel Wayne Prosecuting Attorney v Bitonti, </em>306 Mich 115, 118-119, 123; 10 NW2d 329 (1943); <em>People ex rel Wayne Prosecuting Attorney v Tate, </em>306 Mich 667; 11 NW2d 282 (1943).</p>\n<p id=\"b634-9\">Similarly, see <em>State ex rel Wayne Prosecuting Attorney v Martin, </em>314 Mich 317; 22 NW2d 381 (1946).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b634-10\"> The language from <em>Sill </em>(see accompanying text between fns 1 and 2) paraphrased in fn 5 of the opinion of the Court in the instant case was in response to the argument that the act was constitutionally defective in embracing more than one object, Const 1908, art 5, \u00a7 21. The defendant did not, as here, argue that the act did not apply to ancillary activities facilitating an offense condemned in the padlock act.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-11\">The argument of the dissenters in <em>Western Union </em>was:</p>\n<p id=\"b635-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>\"We have heretofore properly and by necessary inference construed and applied this statute as to the meaning of the phrase, 'used for the purpose of,\u2019 as including acts and uses of property before effectuation of the forbidden purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-6\">\"There is nothing in the <em>Tate Case </em>to show that the car was the place where the bet was completed.

While the owner of the car was transporting the mutuel bet slips, the bets very evidently were not yet accomplished.

The property was an 'essential tool\u2019 used for the purpose of gambling, and clearly falls within the purview of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-9\">\"* * * As to the offense of gambling, it is very apparent that the use of a vehicle in gambling is an accessory use and the vehicle is not the place where the completed offense occurs. It is necessary to conclude that the legislature intended the words 'used for the purpose of to include both meanings, <em>i.e., </em>used to bring about an effectuated purpose and used in pursuance of a purpose not as yet, if ever, effectuated.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-10\">\"The inclusiveness of the meaning of the words 'used for the purpose of is illustrated in the 2 cases, <em>People ex rel Wayne Prosecuting Attorney v Sill </em>and <em>People ex rel Wayne Prosecuting Attorney v Tate, supra. </em>The meaning which the Chief Justice would exclude, has been recognized, used and applied by us in those 2 cases hereinbefore noted.

In each of those cases an automobile, used, as an 'essential tool\u2019 and vital link in a gaming operation, to transport mutuel betting tickets, was held to be a nuisance, subject to seizure and sale. This was corollary to the provisions of 1948 CL 750.306; MSA 28.538, declaring the gambling paraphernalia contained in the vehicles to be a common nuisance and their possession a misdemeanor. The distinction is clear.

The trial judge found:</p>\n<p id=\"b643-8\">\"Now this establishment itself is located in a building approximately 30 x 90 feet. The bar itself is approximately 76 feet in length. There are two television sets, a juke box, a shuffle board and an air hockey game during a part of the time period involved herein. There are approximately 38 tables located in the bar. Live music is offered in the evening and signs were posted from time to time to discourage table hopping, solicitation and loitering. Aside from liquor, beer and other drinks, the bar offers sandwiches and chili to its customers. It is a busy bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-9\">\"Its patrons include persons from many economic and ethnic segments of our society. From elderly persons, electricians, union business agents, salesmen, accountants and vendors, to a few students, lawyers, bankers, truck drivers and policemen, on and off duty, all frequent Anderson\u2019s Gardens. Some bring their spouses for an evening out. Over the years defendant Levenburg developed friendships with some police officers who would' socially visit the bar. These police officer friends would be encouraged to visit the bar by the Levenburgs for safety purposes. In fact, as an accommodation for customers, including police officers, the bar management would cash pay checks. And, in turn, to offer protection to the public, the police at the local precinct would personally accompany Mr. Levenburg laden with cash to and from his bank on a regular basis. Most witnesses described the bar as a noisy, very friendly bar which gives excellent service and gives good food and drink, and so it is. It is, in addition, a safe bar inside.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-10\">\"However, it also has the reputation of a bar where one can meet and pick up prostitutes.

The court did not say that the place where the solicitation and agreement was entered into was a place of assignation; rather, it said that the investigators had there <em>\"made </em>an assignation to repair to the other place where rooms might be obtained\u201d. It spoke of the \"assignation <em>made </em>on the premises\u201d and of the \"assignation so <em>made\", </em>thereby recognizing the distinction between making an assignation (the agreement) and the assignation itself (the appointed time and place for the meeting), a distinction which this Court ignores, despite its favorable citation of <em>Bayside. </em>(Emphasis supplied.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b644-12\"> See fn 13 for text of statute.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
