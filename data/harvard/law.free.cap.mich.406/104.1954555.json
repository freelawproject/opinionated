The first waiver was to State Police Sergeant Ronald Beauchine, who administered a polygraph test to defendant at defendant\u2019s behest, which, he said, was on advice of his lawyer. (In fact, he neither had retained counsel nor had he requested appointment of counsel, it was later discovered.) The second waiver immediately followed the polygraph test when defendant said he wanted to tell Officer Dean all about it. He again waived his <em>Miranda </em>rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-11\">The Court of Appeals (2 to 1) found that the brief exculpatory remarks made by defendant on and after January 31, 1973 were made after the investigation had focused upon defendant and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>should have been excluded <em>sua sponte </em>and that the trial judge erred in failing to grant the motion to suppress the two February 16 confessions. On motion of the defendant to suppress the confession, a <em>Walker</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>hearing had been held and the motion to suppress the confessions was denied. There was no motion to suppress the exculpatory statements and no objection to the admission at trial. Based in important part upon a misstatement of fact, the majority held that the \"totality of circumstances * * * did not satisfy the letter or spirit of the <em>Miranda </em>commandment\u201d. It reversed defendant\u2019s conviction of second-degree murder. The people appealed. We find that the facts do not support either the conclusions of law or policy enunciated by the Court of Appeals majority and so reverse and reinstate the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b271-7\">The sequence of dates and pertinent occurrences are necessary to a viable conclusion. A careful reading of the record reveals these facts \u2014 which are not always precisely in accord with those appearing in the opinion of Justice Levin.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-8\">December 1, 1972: Peggy Smith was found dead, having been manually strangled while alive as evidenced by hemorrhaging on the skin, the protruding tongue, bleeding from the nose and the fractured cartilage below the voice box.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> There was, however, a rope around her neck.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b272-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>December 8, 1972: Defendant came to the police station in response to a telephone request in a general inquiry of persons who had known the deceased. At this time, defendant gave his alibi. He said, in summary, he had been in Tawas for ten days. Because Mrs. Smith had a broken fingernail and some matter under the nail, defendant\u2019s torso was examined. No marks were found; (Later, the lab reported that the matter was not skin.) Defendant said he would take a polygraph test. Note that the alibi was given in this non-custodial, pre-focus inquiry. Many acquaintances of the deceased were being questioned and offered polygraph tests. At least five such tests were given to others than defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-4\">January 31, 1973 (morning): Defendant, in jail on several other unrelated charges, \"had a statement to give\u201d to Officer Dean regarding a juvenile in the unrelated matter.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The officer \"went over\u201d to take the statement. At the end of the interview, Officer Dean \"casually\u201d asked if there was anything else defendant could tell him about Peggy Smith. (He had not seen Brannan in \u00e1lmost two months.) Defendant said there was not. The officer left. This is said to be the <em>first </em>in-custody, warning-less interrogation about the Smith case. Officer Dean was never questioned as to whether he had advised the defendant of his <em>Miranda </em>rights at this discussion. As a result, the record is devoid of testimony on this point.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-5\">January 31, 1973 (afternoon): After leaving defendant, Officer Dean learned that defendant\u2019s mother had advised the police that a clothesline was missing. (The missing rope was later proved not connected with the murder.) Officer Dean re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>ported this fact to defendant who said he knew nothing about the rope. Defendant was asked if he still was willing to take a polygraph test and he indicated negatively but would want to talk to a lawyer first. The officer promptly departed. This was designated the <em>second </em>in-custody questioning. (The officer denied that the investigation had fo-cused_ on defendant and the facts support such a denial.) The trial court record is unclear as to whether Officer Dean gave defendant <em>Miranda </em>warnings before this conversation. In preliminary hearing, the officer was asked if he had advised defendant of \"any rights before [he] talked to him this second time\u201d. The officer answered \"yes\u201d. Later, at a suppression hearing, defense counsel phrased his question differently and asked if the officer had advised defendant of his rights when he \"talked to\u201d defendant \"regarding the Peggy Smith matter\u201d. The officer indicated he had not.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-6\">February 7, 1973: Officer Dean merely asked defendant what his lawyer had advised regarding the polygraph test. Defendant said his attorney, Oscar Baker, Jr., had advised against it. Nothing more was said. The officer was not questioned as to <em>Miranda </em>\"warnings\u201d. This is designated the <em>third </em>warningless in-custody questioning.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-7\">February 15, 1973: Defendant was given a polygraph test at the State Police Post in Bay City on a charge unrelated either to the Smith case or the breaking and entering.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> He was questioned about another murder; Officer Dean went to listen. Defendant passed the test. At the end, Officer Dean asked for some details to check in defendant\u2019s alibi in the Smith case. Defendant gave some \"names\u201d. Again the record is barren of inquiry as to whether the routine <em>Miranda </em>warnings were given <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>prior to the state police polygraph. There was no question on the point \u2014 possibly because it did not seem important. The officer had tried to reach Mr. Baker and failed. The secretary knew nothing of defendant. (In fact, Mr. Baker knew nothing of defendant.) At this time, the police were trying to check out the alibi which they did not know either to be true or false. The record reveals no reason to have disbelieved the alibi or even to have found it shaky.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-4\">This was said to be the <em>fourth </em>in-custody inquiry without <em>Miranda </em>warnings or without a repeat of them, if given before the polygraph. This inquiry also was believed by the Court of Appeals to have been made after focus was upon defendant as the murderer, although Officer Dean denied this. Indeed, the police had not even been suspicious enough to match defendant\u2019s fingerprints with those at the scene of the murder and were only commencing to check the alibi. Officer Dean also had not been suspicious enough to check on the rope. Polygraphs were being given to others and their stories also checked. Prime suspects apparently were the ex-husband of the deceased who had been at the house and with whom she had had intercourse on the evening of the murder, another whom deceased had telephoned and who had been in the house and one seen in the vicinity.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-5\">February 16, 1973: Officer Dean checked further on defendant\u2019s alibi and asked for a lab check of defendant\u2019s fingerprints. They matched those found on the premises. The time and date of the match were stamped on the lab report. This discovery was made <em>after </em>the inquiry above, lending credibility to the assertion that the focus had not evolved upon defendant at the time of the February 15 incident. There is no doubt, however, that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>defendant became suspect in the police investigation after his fingerprints were matched. In error, the Court of Appeals based its opinion of \"focus\u201d as of February 15 in great part upon the misbelief that Officer Dean knew of the fingerprint identification at that time. He did not. The prints had not been matched.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-6\">February 16, 1973 (later in the. day): Officer Dean was told that Brannan wanted to take a polygraph test. The prosecutor asked the officer to transport defendant to the Bay City State Police Post. There are no allegations that Officer Dean made any reference to the Smith case or polygraph during the transporting. (He said he did not.) He turned defendant over to Sergeant Ronald Beauchine, who testified in the suppression hearing as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b275-7\">\"I advised Mr. Brannan that he had a right to remain silent. I advised him that anything he said could be used against him. I advised him that he had a right to have an attorney present before any questioning. He could talk with an attorney before we \u2014 before I questioned him. I also advised him that if he could not afford an attorney one would be appointed to represent him at no cost before any questioning. I asked him \u2014 I also told him that he could stop talking to me any time he wanted to. I told him he could get up and leave the room at any time he wanted to. I asked him if he understood what his rights were. He stated that he did. And in regards to an attorney, he advised me that he had talked to a Mr. Baker, and Mr. Baker informed him to take the polygraph examination. He stated that he was willing to talk with me in regards to the murder of Peggy Smith.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b275-8\">Defendant confessed to the murder. When Bran-nan said that he wanted to tell Officer Dean all <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>about it, the officer repeated the <em>Miranda </em>warnings and defendant again confessed the murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b276-7\">The case has been cast in the perspective of defendant\u2019s youth (defendant was 18 at the time of trial), his lack of a high school diploma, his propensity to lie and improper, coercive police interrogation. Defendant\u2019s age, education and propensity to lie<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> are not denied. (Appellate defense counsel claimed that defendant was a \"pathological liar\u201d.) On the other hand, the record discloses a person well acquainted with courts and police. Aside from his problems as a juvenile and his placement in a boy\u2019s residential facility, he had been committed, for breaking and entering, to Camp Pugsley, an adult Corrections Department facility. The psychologist, Dr. Sophie Lovinger, testifying for the defense, stated regarding Brannan:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-8\">\"He really doesn\u2019t have a conscience. He has no feelings of guilt that most of us have that prevent us from doing the things that we know are wrong.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b276-9\">In short, Mr. Brannan has been cast as a young, not highly educated, inexperienced innocent who was coerced by the police into making a confession. Also, the police somehow should have known that defendant was lying \u2014 first by telling Officer Dean about his attorney\u2019s advice against a polygraph test and next by telling Sergeant Beauchine that his attorney advised him to take the poly<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>graph when, in fact, he had retained no attorney nor had he asked that one be appointed \u2014 despite the several advisements of his right to retained or appointed counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-4\">The \"improper\u201d, \"coercive\u201d activities of Officer Dean are easily summarized as:</p>\n<p id=\"b277-5\">1. He asked defendant if he could tell him anything else about Peggy Smith (upon initiation by defendant Officer Dean had just concluded an interview with Brannan on another matter. This was \u00e1 casual question at the end.) Defendant said he did not. (Between December 8, 1972 and January 31, 1973, no further inquiry of defendant had been made so far as the record reveals.)</p>\n<p id=\"b277-6\">2. After defendant\u2019s mother reported a missing clothesline, the officer told defendant about it. (Defendant said \u2014 truthfully\u2014that he knew nothing about it.) The officer asked about the polygraph which defendant earlier had said he would take and the matter was dropped when defendant replied negatively, but left the door open for advice of a lawyer.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-7\">3. Officer Dean checked back to see if a decision had been made about the polygraph. Defendant said his attorney advised him not to take the test.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-8\">4. After defendant took (and passed) a polygraph test in Bay City in an Unrelated matter, the officer asked for some details of the alibi to be checked in the Smith matter. Defendant gave him some \"names\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-9\">The totality of these short remarks both by the officer and Brannan (two at the end of questioning on other matters) reveals no coercive behavior and no inculpatory statements. The officer claims, and the trial court found, that the investigation did not focus upon defendant until February 16 when his fingerprints were compared with those at the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>scene of the murder. After that, no questions were asked prior to <em>Miranda </em>warnings.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-4\">However, the Court of Appeals opinion misstates a crucial fact in finding that the defendant was \"a prime suspect\u201d before the inquiry in number 4 above. The majority opinion says:</p>\n<p id=\"b278-5\">\"Palm prints of the defendant had been obtained at the scene of the crime. He must have been a prime suspect.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b278-6\">The prints were not matched until <em>after </em>the last inquiry at the State Police Post.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-7\">The investigation appears to have been general, and routine. Polygraph tests were being given to a number of people and whereabouts of acquaintances were being checked. There is no reason to disbelieve the officer in charge or to second-guess the trial court. Defendant\u2019s alibi as stated almost two months before he was in custody for the unrelated crimes was just being checked and his fingerprints compared <em>after </em>the last short inquiry noted above (after the unrelated polygraph test). As we stated in <em>People v Reed, </em>393 Mich 342, 357; 224 NW2d 867 (1975), when determining when <em>Miranda </em>warnings must be given:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b278-8\">\"[T]he 'deciding factor, in each case, is determined by examining the specificity of the investigation, <em>i.e., </em>whether the investigation has focused on one suspect.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b278-9\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b278-10\">This is not a case in which the police took a person into custody, failed to inform the person of his rights, questioned him insistently until incriminating evidence or some other lever was obtained <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>and then belatedly gave the <em>Miranda </em>warnings just before the virtually foregone conclusion of obtaining a formal confession. The defendant voluntarily supplied the false alibi at the initial noncustodial, pre-focus general investigatory meeting on December 8. No further contact occurred until nearly two months later. The critical polygraph was not arranged until after the defendant had been given the time to consult an attorney and indicated he had. The police did not focus on the defendant until after the fingerprints were checked and matched on February 16 \u2014 two and one-half months after the initial non-custodial conversation \u2014 and from that point on full and complete <em>Miranda </em>warnings were given. There is no indication that the defendant was confronted with evidence contradicting his alibi or was in any other way coerced into taking the polygraph examination. That, examination was preceded by <em>Miranda </em>warnings as was his subsequent confession to Officer Dean.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-6\">The defendant\u2019s initial false alibi was of his own doing and any connection between it and his ultimate confession was internally generated, not police-generated.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-7\">Nor is this a case in which the police have isolated the defendant from counsel or have grilled the defendant in such a way that the ultimate giving of the <em>Miranda </em>warnings prior to obtaining a confession was a meaningless gesture.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-8\"><em>Westover v United States, </em>384 US 494; 86 S Ct 1638; 16 L Ed 2d 735 (1966), decided together with <em>Miranda, </em>is an example of the kind of case in which the giving of <em>Miranda </em>warnings is not enough to render a confession admissible. The defendant in that case was arrested at 9:45 p.m. by state authorities in connection with two local rob<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>beries. He was jailed and interrogated that night and interrogated throughout the next morning until noon without any advice as to his rights. He was then turned over to Federal authorities for interrogation about a different crime. The Federal authorities did advise the defendant of his rights and obtained a confession a few hours later. The United States Supreme Court said the confession was erroneously admitted by the trial court because \"we cannot find that Westover knowingly and intelligently waived his right to remain silent and his right to consult with counsel * * *. [F]rom Westover\u2019s point of view the warnings came at the end of the interrogation process\u201d. <em>Id., </em>495-496. The Court added, however:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-6\">\"A different case would be presented if an accused were taken into custody by the second authority, removed both in time and place from his original surroundings, and then adequately advised of his rights and given an opportunity to exercise them. But here the FBI interrogation was conducted immediately following the state interrogation in the same police station \u2014in the same compelling surroundings.\u201d <em>Id., </em>496.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b280-7\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b280-8\">In applying the <em>Miranda </em>decision, it is important to remember the context in which it was decided.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-9\">The Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution assures us that \"[n]o person * * * shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself\u2019. In 1964, Manuel Escobedo had been denied a request to speak to his retained counsel (and vice versa) while the police interrogated him, handcuffed and standing for four hours until he confessed murder. The confession <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>was admitted into testimony and Escobedo was convicted. The United States Supreme Court reversed, finding the confession inadmissible as being obtained under compulsion. <footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b281-6\">In speaking of the four consolidated cases which followed <em>Escobedo, </em>now generally known as <em>Miranda, </em>the Court noted that in each case, \"the defendant was thrust into an unfamiliar atmosphere and run through menacing police interrogation procedures\u201d. It also noted that \"such an interrogation environment is created for no purpose other than to subjugate the individual to the will of his examiner\u201d. It also said that the entire thrust of those warningless police interrogations was to \"put the defendant in such an emotional state as to impair his capacity for rational judgment\u201d.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Emphasis was placed on the evils associated with persistent, continuous, incommunicado interrogation.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-7\">Those evils are not present in this case. The police questioned the defendant, but not in any continuous overbearing or menacing way. The discussions were separated by long stretches of time during which the defendant could contact friends, relatives or an attorney. He was given the time to seek the advice of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-8\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b281-9\">In summary, if there was a causal connection between the false alibi and the confession, it was self-generated, not police-generated. (There is no evidence of such a connection.) The alibi was given in a pre-custodial, pre-focus, general investigation of many people and cannot fairly be said to have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>resulted from either improper or coercive police conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-5\">Examined separately, and collectively, the four short pre-confession, in-custody encounters of Brannan with the police while he was in jail for the unrelated crimes were at different times and one at a different place (Bay City). Two followed questioning concerning two other crimes and were short and not coercive or threatening. It is difficult to estimate with a high degree of accuracy but judging from the testimony, all pre-confession, in-custody conversations about the Smith case probably totalled no more than 20 to 30 minutes, at most. None of Brannan\u2019s remarks were inculpa-tory. The investigation had not focused upon him.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-6\">After defendant\u2019s palm prints were found by the lab to match some on the premises no more conversation was held with defendant excepting a general one while transporting defendant to the polygraph he said his attorney had advised him to take.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-7\">The Court of Appeals erroneously believed the palm prints had been matched before the February 15 conversation in Bay City and so found \"focus\u201d at that time. However, at no time after the lab results was there any inquiry or conversation with defendant about the Smith case until the <em>Miranda </em>warnings were given prior to the confessions.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-8\">The confessions were each made after receiving full warnings of his constitutional rights, including his right to stop the questioning at any time, consult a lawyer, or walk out of the room.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-9\">With discussion about counsel cited above, plus his considerable previous experience with the police and courts, it is not believable that defendant did not know he had a right to retained or ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>pointed counsel. In fact, the defendant led the police to believe that he had sought the advice of a lawyer and was following his advice.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-4\">In total perspective, this is not the kind of police behavior addressed by <em>Miranda </em>and its progeny as causing a person to confess under compulsion.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-5\">Reversed and the conviction is reinstated.</p>\n<judges id=\"b283-6\">Williams, Fitzgerald, and Ryan, JJ., concurred with Coleman, C.J.</judges>\n<author id=\"b283-7\">Levin, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Avq\">Herbert Steven Brannan was convicted of second-degree murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-8\">The victim\u2019s body was found in her home on December 1, 1972. The cause of death was strangulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-9\">Between December 8, 1972 and February 15, 1973, Brannan, a 17-year old with a ninth-grade education, was questioned by a police detective five times without receiving Miranda<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> warnings. All but the first interview took place in the county jail where Brannan was being held on an unrelated charge. Brannan was apprised of his <em>Miranda </em>rights during a sixth interview on February 16th, which took place at the state police post to which he had been taken for a polygraph test. During the examination, and again immediately thereafter, Brannan gave a confessional statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-10\">The Court of Appeals held that inculpatory and exculpatory statements given by Brannan, except during the first interview when he was not in custody, should have been suppressed, and remanded for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-11\">In reversing, this Court states that \"[i]n total perspective, this is not the kind of police behavior <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>addressed by <em>Miranda </em>and its progeny as causing a person to confess under compulsion\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-4\">Because the rule of law stated in <em>Miranda </em>applies without regard to whether a defendant\u2019s confession is voluntary and that rule was violated, we would affirm the Court of Appeals and remand for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b284-6\">Brannan, an acquaintance of the victim\u2019s son and of the victim, received a telephone call from a police detective requesting an interview. At the police station on December 8, 1972, Brannan told the officer he had been out of town for the preceding ten days. What was thought to be skin had been found under the victim\u2019s fingernails, and Brannan submitted to an examination of his upper torso. No scratches or other tell-tale marks were discovered. The detective asked Brannan to take a polygraph examination and Brannan said he was willing to do so. No <em>Miranda </em>warnings were given.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-7\">The second interview took place on the morning of January 31, 1973 in the county jail where Brannan was in custody on an unrelated possession of stolen goods charge. The officer, after questioning Brannan regarding the stolen goods charge, questioned him about the murder. Bran-nan reiterated that he was out of town and gave the names of persons who could corroborate his alibi. No <em>Miranda </em>warnings were given.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-8\">Later that day, the officer was informed by Brannan\u2019s mother that a piece of clothesline fitting the description of the rope found around the victim\u2019s neck was missing from the Brannan home. The officer returned to Brannan\u2019s cell and confronted him with this evidence. Brannan claimed he knew nothing about the rope; it was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>ultimately determined that the rope around the victim\u2019s neck was not the clothesline missing from the Brannan home. The officer renewed his suggestion that Brannan submit to a polygraph examination. Brannan told him that he wished first to consult with a lawyer. No <em>Miranda </em>warnings were given.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-4\">A fourth interview took place one week later, February 7, 1973, again in the county jail. Bran-nan informed the officer that his lawyer had advised him not to take a polygraph examination. Brannan named his lawyer, a prominent member of the local bar. Actually, Brannan had not consulted or retained a lawyer. No <em>Miranda </em>warnings were given.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-5\">The fifth interview took place February 15th. Brannan was asked \"for more details and if he could be more specific\u201d about his alibi. He supplied additional information. No <em>Miranda </em>warnings were given.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b286-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>The detective testified that on the morning of February 16th he received a call from the prosecutor who told him that Brannan was now willing to take a polygraph examination. The record does not indicate how the prosecutor obtained this information.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-6\">Before administering the polygraph examination, a state police officer advised Brannan of his <em>Miranda </em>rights. During the examination, which lasted 2-1/4 hours, Brannan made inculpatory statements. He subsequently signed a waiver of rights and gave a confessional statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-7\">The trial judge denied a motion to suppress the confession, saying that Brannan was not a \"firm suspect\u201d until February 16th and had voluntarily waived his rights before confessing.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-8\">The Court of Appeals concluded that Brannan\u2019s in-custody statements should have been suppressed because of the failure to give <em>Miranda </em>warnings until immediately before the polygraph examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-9\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b286-10\">The people contend that the investigation had not focused on Brannan until shortly before the polygraph examination and therefore there was no need to give <em>Miranda </em>warnings.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-11\">In <em>People v Reed, </em>393 Mich 342; 224 NW2d 867 (1975), the defendant was questioned in his own apartment and the issue was whether he was in custody for <em>Miranda </em>purposes. In deciding that he was, the Court addressed the question whether the investigation had focused on the accused.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b287-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>In this case, Brannan was in jail, although on another charge, when all the interviews but the first were conducted. The United States Supreme Court has held that <em>Miranda </em>applies although the defendant is being held on a charge other than the one about which he was questioned and gave a statement. \"We find nothing in the <em>Miranda </em>opinion which calls for a curtailment of the warnings to be given persons under interrogation by officers based on the reason why the person is in custody.\u201d <em>Mathis v United </em>States, 391 US 1, 4-5; 88 S Ct 1503; 20 L Ed 2d 381 (1968).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b287-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b287-6\">Brannan\u2019s suppression motion was directed to the confessional statement, not specifically to the false alibi statements. The prosecutor contends <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>that the Court of Appeals therefore erred in considering the alibi statements in deciding whether to suppress the confessional statements.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b288-6\">Brannan duly objected to the admission of the confessional statements. A <em>Walker</em><footnotemark><em>6</em></footnotemark><em> </em>hearing was conducted. In assessing whether a confessional statement should be suppressed a court is obliged to consider all relevant evidence. The circumstance that some of that evidence consists of statements that might themselves have been suppressed but which were admitted at the trial without objection does not affect their relevancy or competency or abridge the scope of the record to be considered in deciding the admissibility of statements duly objected to.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-7\">While Brannan\u2019s failure to object to the admission of the alibi statements might be regarded as a waiver of his right to object to their admission, the Court of Appeals did not err in considering those statements and the circumstances in which they were given in deciding whether the subsequent confessional statements should be suppressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-8\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b288-9\">The prosecutor relies on cases where courts concluded that confessional statements need not be suppressed simply because the defendant had earlier, without being adequately warned of his rights, made incriminating statements. <em>Mapys v United States, </em>409 F2d 964 (CA 10, 1969); <em>Commonwealth v Greene, </em>456 Pa 195; 317 A2d 268 (1974); <em>Commonwealth v Marabel, </em>445 Pa 435; 283 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>A2d 285 (1971); <em>United States v Trabucco, </em>424 F2d 1311 (CA 5, 1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b289-5\">In <em>United States v Trabucco </em>the Court declared that a \"significant causal relationship [between the pre-warning statement and the post-warning confession] will bring the confession within the <em>Miranda </em>exclusionary rule\u201d. <em>Id., </em>p 1319. The issue was similarly analyzed in the other pertinent cases relied on by the prosecutor, where it was held only that a confession will not be suppressed because of pre-warning inculpatory statements absent such a significant causal relationship.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b290-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>In the instant case the questioning at the county jail appears to have been a significant factor in bringing about Brannan\u2019s confession. In the course of the warningless questioning Brannan gave a false alibi. During subsequent interrogations, upon the detective\u2019s request, he elaborated, providing details.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> He knew that the alibi was false, and that ultimately the police would determine it was false unless they earlier became convinced of his innocence.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-6\">Brannan, although he had indicated a reluctance to do so, was persuaded to submit to a polygraph examination.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Because of the falsity of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>his alibi it was unlikely that he would pass a polygraph examination. During the examination, Brannan was advised that he had not passed, and thereafter made false or inculpatory statements which were followed by a full confession.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-6\">While it does not appear whether the falsity of his alibi was revealed during the polygraph examination or whether it was some other discrepancy which caused the examining officer to advise him that he had not passed the examination, the false alibi appears to have played a significant role in Brannan\u2019s decision to confess. In his closing argument the prosecutor said as much:</p>\n<p id=\"b291-7\">\"We know now that on the 8th of December, thereabouts, he gave a false alibi as to where' he was. He informed the officer at that time, on first interview, that he was out of town for ten days and just got back. Ten days, of course, on the 8th of December being long enough to cover the date of the offense.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b291-8\"><em>\"Subsequently, on February the 15th, he elaborated on this alibi by providing persons that he was with, </em>at least one person that he was with. It is interesting, in respect to that, and I kind of noted here that in respect to the defendant\u2019s testimony, that [the detective] would find out about the false alibi and he seemed to, in some way, project this as somehow discovering the falsity of his confession, and I inserted it here because I suspect that <em>it explains the confession.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b291-9\"><em>\"Knowing that on the 15th the officer has returned and asked him to detail about this alibi he had given him, </em>being in Tawas on the 8th of December, that that is <em>what he realized would be discovered, and the futility </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number><em>of denying his involvement in the death.\u201d </em>(Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">Our conclusion that there is a significant causal relationship between the pre-warning statements at the jail and the post-warning confessions makes it unnecessary for us to consider whether the warnings, given to Brannan after he had been persuaded to agree to speak, came too late.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b293-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>V</p>\n<p id=\"b293-6\"><em>Michigan v Tucker, </em>417 US 433; 94 S Ct 2357; 41 L Ed 2d 182 (1974), dealt not with the admissibility of a confessional statement obtained from the defendant, but the admissibility of the testimony of an alibi witness named by the defendant during the interrogation before he had been fully warned of his rights. The \u00e1dmissibility of a statement given by the defendant himself was not involved. \"[T]he respondent did <em>not </em>[emphasis in original] accuse himself. The evidence which the prosecution successfully sought to introduce was not a confession of guilt by respondent, or indeed even an <em>exculpatory statement by respondent </em>[emphasis supplied], but rather the testimony of a third party who was subjected to no custodial pressures.\u201d <em>Id,, </em>p 449.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-7\">In the instant case, in contrast with <em>Tucker </em>and <em>Michigan v Mosley, </em>423 US 96; 96 S Ct 321; 46 <em>h </em>Ed 2d 313 (1975), where the Court emphasized the apparent good faith of the officer, there was uq advice whatsoever to Brannan of his rights.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The failure to advise him of his rights does not seem to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>have been inadvertent.

It is difficult to imagine a more purposeful violation of the <em>Miranda </em>requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-6\">Brannan\u2019s statements that he had consulted counsel and that counsel had advised him not to take a polygraph examination, although false, indicate that he was reluctant to talk to the detective and to undergo a polygraph examination. Had he been fully advised of his rights he may have exercised them, thereby requiring the officer to suspend further questioning. <em>Michigan v </em>Mosley, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b294-7\">While Brannan\u2019s confession <em>may </em>have been voluntary in the traditional sense, a purpose of <em>Miranda </em>was to reduce the number of cases in which courts would be called upon to determine whether the pressures inherent in custodial questioning together with other factors such as the age and education of the defendant require suppression of a confessional statement on the ground that it was involuntary.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Brannan, a relatively young man at the time, who had not graduated from high school, appears on this record to be particularly susceptible to the kinds of psychological pressures at which <em>Miranda </em>was primarily directed.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>of Appeals correctly concluded that suppression of the statements was required by the policy and purpose of the <em>Miranda </em>decision.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b295-6\">We would affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals suppressing the confessional statements and remanding for a new trial, and directing that at a new trial such statements and other statements, inculpatory and exculpatory,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> given while Brannan was in custody without <em>Miranda </em>warnings, shall not be admitted.</p>\n<judges id=\"b295-7\">Kavanagh, J., concurred with Levin, J.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b296-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>Blair Moody, Jr., J., took no part in the decision of this case.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b270-12\"> <em>Miranda v Arizona, </em>384 US 436; <em>86 </em>S Ct 1602; 16 L Ed 2d 694; 10 ALR3d 974 (1966).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b271-9\"><em> People v Walker (On Rehearing), 374 </em>Mich 331; 132 NW2d 87 (1965).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b271-10\"> Dr. Leaby\u2019s testimony.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b271-11\"> In his confession, defendant said he placed the rope around the neck in an effort to make the death appear to be suicide.

Also, there are a number of discrepancies between Brannan\u2019s confession and the known facts. Some of the facts of which he was aware may have become known to him as a person who had been in the victim\u2019s home a number of times, and a number of the details of the crime were a matter of local gossip in taverns frequented by Brannan and others. The considerations just mentioned have, indeed, no relevance in the disposition of this case. <em>Cf. Haynes v Washington, </em>373 US 503, 518; 83 S Ct 1336; 10 L Ed 2d 513 (1963); <em>Rogers v Richmond, </em>365 US 534, 541; 81 S Ct 735; 5 L Ed 2d 760 (1961). We advert to them simply to emphasize that this is not a case where one could properly say, whether or not pertinent, that the confessional statement bears its own earmarks of authenticity or that the defendant would have been convicted without the confession.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b295-12\"> <em>Miranda v Arizona, supra, </em>pp 444, 477.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
