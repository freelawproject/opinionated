Wayne County Hearing Panel No. 9 on March 28, 1978 finding the appellant guilty of misconduct and ordering that he be suspended from the practice of law for a period of 90 days.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-13\">The appellant filed an appeal with our Court from this determination of the State Bar Griev-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>anee Board. The Court has considered the appellant\u2019s briefs on appeal and the determination of the State Bar Grievance Board and finds support for some but not all of its conclusions.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-5\">The record reveals that the appellant agreed to represent a client on a contingent-fee basis in a medical malpractice dispute. The client made several inquiries about the progress of the law suit. Appellant, without determining the status of his file on this matter, made numerous representations to the client that a complaint had been filed. \u00d1o complaint was ever filed and the statute of limitations ran. The appellant does not dispute the facts. The record supports the determination of Wayne County Hearing Panel No. 9 that the appellant violated Code of Professional Responsibility and Canons, DR 7-10KA),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> DR 1-102(A)(5)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and State Bar Rule 15, \u00a7 2(4).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We agree with appellant that the record does not support the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>determination that appellant violated DR 1-102(A)(6).</p>\n<p id=\"b673-5\">Appellant argues he was denied due process because he was never served with a copy of the client\u2019s complaint in the mandamus action the client filed against the Grievance Board to compel a formal hearing on the client\u2019s complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-6\">Appellant was an interested party and could have answered the complaint had he desired. He was invited to do so by the clerk of this Court, but did not avail himself of the opportunity. The order of this Court directing a formal hearing did not affect appellant\u2019s rights. He was served with a formal complaint setting forth all the charges against him. He filed an answer and was awarded a hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-7\">The discipline imposed by the Grievance. Board is not excessive under the circumstances of this case. The 90-day suspension from the practice of law is warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-8\">Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b673-9\">Coleman, C.J., and Kavanagh, Williams, Levin, Fitzgerald, Ryan, and Blair Moody, Jr., JJ., concurred.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b672-6\"> \"(A) A lawyer shall not intentionally:</p>\n<p id=\"b672-7\">\"(1) Fail to seek the lawful objectives of his client through reasonably available means permitted by law and the Disciplinary Rules, except as provided by DR 7-101(B).
