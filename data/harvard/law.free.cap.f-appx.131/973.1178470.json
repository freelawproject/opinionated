He argues that under <em>United States v. Booker, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), and <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), the guidelines enhancements and upward departure from the guidelines violated his Sixth Amendment rights. Gardner has not shown, however, that the district court would have sentenced him differently under an advisory guidelines scheme rather than the mandatory scheme in place at the time he was sentenced. <em>See United States v. Akpan, </em>407 F.3d 360, 377-78 (5th Cir.2005). He has therefore failed to show that the district court plainly erred. <em>See United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 513 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1000-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
