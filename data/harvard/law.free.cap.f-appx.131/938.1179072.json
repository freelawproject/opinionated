The only issue Orellana asserts on appeal is that the evidence was insufficient to support his convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b964-23\">We conclude from the parties\u2019 submissions on appeal that there is substantial evidence, taking the view most favorable to the Government, to support the verdict. <em>Glasser v. United States, </em>315 U.S. 60, 80, 62 S.Ct. 457, 86 L.Ed. 680 (1942). While Orellana asserts that the evidence presented at trial failed to establish that he knowingly and intentionally imported or possessed cocaine, we conclude, construing the evidence presented at trial in the light most favorable to the Government, that the jury properly resolved this issue in the Government\u2019s favor. <em>See United States v. Wilson, </em>115 F.3d 1185, 1190 (4th Cir.1997). Thus, we affirm Orellana\u2019s convictions. We dispense with oral argument because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"939\">*939</page-number>the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b965-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
