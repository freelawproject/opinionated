We have reviewed the record and find no reversible error. Accordingly, we affirm on the reasoning of the district <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"936\">*936</page-number>court. <em>See Frothingham v. Rumsfeld, </em>No. CA-04-82-1 (E.D.Va. Nov. 18, 2004). We also deny Frothingham\u2019s motion for oral argument. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b962-4\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
