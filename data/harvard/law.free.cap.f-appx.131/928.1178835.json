Mu contends that his motion to reconsider provided the Board with new legal arguments. <em>See Matter of Cema, </em>20 I. &amp; N. Dec. 399, 405 n. 2 (BIA 1991) (\u201cA motion to reconsider \u2018is a request that the Board reexamine its decision in light of additional legal arguments, a change of law, or perhaps an argument or aspect of the case which was overlooked, while [a] motion to reopen is usually based upon new evidence or a change in factual circumstances.\u2019 \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b954-20\">We review the Board\u2019s denial of a motion to reconsider for an abuse of discretion. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(a) (2004); <em>Yanez-Popp v. INS, </em>998 F.2d 231, 234 (4th Cir.1993). A motion to reconsider asserts that the Board made an error in its earlier decision. The motion must \u201cstate the reasons for the motion by specifying the errors of fact or law in the. prior Board decision and shall be supported by pertinent authority.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(b)(1). Such motions are especially disfavored \u201cin a deportation proceeding, where, as a general matter, every delay works to the advantage of the deportable alien who wishes merely to remain in the United States.\u201d <em>INS v. Doherty, </em>502 U.S. 314, 323, 112 S.Ct. 719, 116 L.Ed.2d 823 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b954-21\">We have reviewed the administrative record and the Board\u2019s decision and conclude the Board did not abuse its discretion when it denied Mu\u2019s motion to reconsider. Accordingly, we deny the petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the ma<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"929\">*929</page-number>terials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b955-5\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
