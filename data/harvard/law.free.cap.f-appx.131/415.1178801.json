We have reviewed the record and the Board\u2019s order and find that substantial evidence supports the Board\u2019s decision to uphold the immigration judge\u2019s denial of Busiku\u2019s requests for withholding of removal and protection under the Convention Against Torture. Accordingly, we deny the petition for review on the reasoning of the Board. <em>See In re: Busiku, </em>No. A95-221-369 (B.I.A. Sept. 10, 2004). We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-6\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
