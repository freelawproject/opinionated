Washington, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), the district court erred in enhancing his sentence based on Rangas\u2019s prior federal child pornography conviction where that conviction was not charged in the indictment, proved to a jury, or expressly admitted. Rangas further contends that the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998) (holding that the fact of a prior conviction need not be alleged in the indictment or submitted to the jury), does not apply to a defendant who has not admitted to his prior conviction. Rangas argues that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>has been \u201cgravely wounded\u201d by the subsequent decisions of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), and <em>Blakely, </em>and as such, should only be applied to cases where the facts closely match those addressed in <em>Almendarez-Torres.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b727-17\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b727-18\">Because Rangas raised his <em>Blakely </em>challenge below, preserving the issue for appellate review, we review his sentence <em>de novo, </em>but will reverse and remand only for harmful error. <em>United States v. Riley, </em>250 F.3d 1303, 1307 n. 5 (11th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b727-19\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b727-20\">Rangas was sentenced pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2252A(b)(2), which provides for a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"702\">*702</page-number>minimum sentence of 10 years\u2019 imprisonment for a violation of \u00a7 2252A(a)(5) if the defendant has a prior federal child pornography conviction. Based on his prior conviction, for which Kangas was still under supervised release at the time of his offense, the district court sentenced Kangas to the statutory minimum of ten years (120 months) in prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-4\">In <em>United States v. Booker, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), which was announced after the parties filed their appellate briefs, the Supreme Court held that the mandatory nature of the guidelines rendered them incompatible with the Sixth Amendment\u2019s jury trial guarantee. However, <em>Booker </em>makes clear that there is no Sixth Amendment violation where the district court uses prior convictions to enhance a defendant\u2019s sentence. <em>See Booker, </em>125 S.Ct. at 756 (\u201cAny fact <em>(other than a prior conviction), </em>which is necessary to support a sentence exceeding the maximum authorized by the facts established by a plea of guilty or a jury verdict must be admitted by the defendant or proved to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d) (emphasis added). <em>Booker </em>thus casts no constitutional doubt on a district court\u2019s ability to rely on prior convictions to enhance a defendant\u2019s sentence, as the defendant\u2019s prior conviction \u201cmust itself have been established through procedures satisfying the fair notice, reasonable doubt, and jury trial guarantees.\u201d <em>United States v. Orduno-Mireles, </em>405 F.3d 960, 962 (11th Cir.2005). We thus reject Kangas\u2019s contention that the <em>Blakely </em>line of cases requires that prior convictions be admitted by the defendant or found by a jury beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-7\">Nor can we find non-constitutional \u201cstatutory\u201d <em>Booker </em>error in Kangas\u2019s sentence. Non-constitutional <em>Booker </em>error occurs where the district court sentenced a defendant under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(b)(1)\u2014 the now-excised provision which rendered the Sentencing Guidelines range binding on the district court. <em>United States v. Shelton, </em>400 F.3d 1325, 1330-31 (11th Cir. 2005). In this case, Kangas was not sentenced within a guidelines range, rendered mandatory by \u00a7 3553(b)(1). Rather, he was sentenced under the minimum 120 month sentence provided for in the criminal statute itself. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2252A(b)(2) (prescribing a 120 month minimum sentence for violators of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2252A(a)(5) with a prior child pornography or child sex abuse conviction). Under these circumstances, where even after the excise of \u00a7 3553(b)(1) Kangas would be subject to the same 120-month minimum sentence, any non-constitutional <em>Booker </em>error that could have affected the computation of his guidelines range was harmless. <em>See Shelton, </em>400 F.3d at 1333 n. 10 (\u2018We emphasize that the district court was, and still is, bound by the statutory minimums.\u201d); <em>see also, United States v. Sharpley, </em>399 F.3d 123, 127 (2d Cir.2005) (where defendant\u2019s sentence was set to statutory minimum for child sex offenders, any non-constitutional <em>Booker </em>error in computation of lower guidelines offense level was harmless, as defendant could obtain no improvement in his sentence upon remand for discretionary sentencing).</p>\n<p id=\"b728-9\">While we thus find no reversible error in the district court\u2019s 120-month sentence, there appears to be an inconsistency between the charge to which Kangas pled and was sentenced and the charge that appears in the judgment. Kangas pled guilty to <em>possession </em>of child pornography, which violates 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2252A(a)(5). However, the indictment and order of judgment erroneously reference \u00a7 2252A(a)(2), which criminalizes the <em>distribution or receipt </em>of child pornography. The entirety of the record, particularly the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"703\">*703</page-number>fact that Rangas was sentenced under \u00a7 2252A(b)(2)\u2019s 10 year statutory minimum, which applies only to violations of \u00a7 2252A(a)(5), make clear that the order of judgment\u2019s reference to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2252A(a)(2) is erroneous and should have referenced 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2252A(a)(5).</p>\n<p id=\"b729-5\">Though neither of the parties raised this issue, we may raise the issue of clerical errors in the judgment <em>sua sponte </em>and remand with instructions that the district court correct the errors. <em>See United States v. Anderton, </em>136 F.3d 747, 751 (11th Cir.1998) (remanding with directions to the district court to correct the clerical errors where the statute cited in the judgment and commitment order was incorrect). Although we affirm Rangas\u2019s sentence as to the <em>Booker </em>issues raised on appeal, we vacate and remand for the limited purpose of correcting this error. <em>See Anderton, </em>136 F.3d at 751.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-7\">AFFIRMED IN PART; VACATED AND REMANDED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b727-12\">. As discussed below, the order of judgment entered by the district court erroneously cites the statute of conviction as \"18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2252A(a)(2)\u201d rather than 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2252A(a)(5).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
