Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 483-84, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992). We have reviewed the evidence of record and conclude that Sutanto fails to show that the evidence compels a contrary result. Additionally, to the extent that Sutanto claims that the Board\u2019s use of the summary affirmance procedure as set forth in 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(e)(4) (2004) was improper or impermissible, we find that this claim is squarely foreclosed, by our decision in <em>Blanco de Belbruno v. Ashcroft, </em>362 F.3d 272 (4th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b956-22\">Accordingly, we deny the petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"931\">*931</page-number>fore the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b957-5\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b956-17\"> We note that Sutanto fails to challenge the IJ\u2019s denial of her application for withholding of removal and protection under the CAT. In any event, we lack jurisdiction over any challenge to the denial of withholding of removal and protection under the CAT because Sutanto failed to properly exhaust these claims in her appeal to the Board. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d)(1) (2000); <em>Asika v. Ashcroft, </em>362 F.3d 264, 267 n. 3 (4th Cir.2004), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 861, 160 L.Ed.2d 769 (2005).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
