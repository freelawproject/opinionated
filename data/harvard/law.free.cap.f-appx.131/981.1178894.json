He argues that the enhancement of his sentence pursuant to United States Sentencing Guidelines \u00a7 2A4.1(b)(3) violates <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), because the enhancement was not charged in the indictment and the facts underlying the enhancement were not found by a jury or admitted by him. We do not address whether Benito-Herrera\u2019s appeal waiver applies to his <em>Blakely </em>argument, because, even if he did not waive the right to raise this argument on appeal, his sentence should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-25\">In <em>Blakely, </em>the Supreme Court held that the Sixth Amendment prohibits state sentences greater than \u201cthe maximum sentence a judge may impose solely on the basis of the facts reflected in the jury <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"982\">*982</page-number>verdict or admitted by the defendant.\u201d <em>Blakely, </em>124 S.Ct. at 2537. In <em>United States v. Booker, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 125 S.Ct. 738, 749-50, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), the Supreme Court held that the system of enhancements established by the federal sentencing guidelines violated the Sixth Amendment as construed in <em>Blakely.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1008-6\">This court\u2019s review is for plain error because Benito-Herrera\u2019s <em>Blakely </em>argument is raised for the first time on appeal. <em>See United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 520 (5th Cir.2005), <em>petition for cert, filed </em>(U.S. March 31, 2005) (No. 04-9517). The enhancement of Benito-Herrera\u2019s sentence under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2A4.1(b)(3) was plain error because the facts underlying the enhancement were found by the sentencing judge under a mandatory guidelines system. <em>See Mares, </em>402 F.3d at 520-21. Nothing in the record indicates, however, that the plain error affected Benito-Herrera\u2019s substantial rights. <em>See id. </em>at 522. Accordingly, Benito-Herrera\u2019s sentence is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1007-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
