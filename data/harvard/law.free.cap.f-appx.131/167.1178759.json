(Cadle). The bankruptcy court granted Taras\u2019 motion, and the district court affirmed. The primary issue on appeal is the proper application of the formula set out in 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 522(f)(2)(A) for determining when a judicial lien impairs an exemption to which the debtor was entitled. Because we conclude the bankruptcy court and the district court correctly applied 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 522, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-24\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b193-25\">Bobby D. Associates obtained a judgment against Taras and assigned its interest in the judicial lien to Cadle. The lien was secured by Taras\u2019 residence and was perfected on September 6, 2001. On August 5, 2003, Taras filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy. At that time, the total amount due on the judgment was $18,911.54.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-26\">Taras and his wife jointly own their home, which is valued at $213,000.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The home is subject to a first priority mortgage of $85,193 owed by Taras and his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>wife. Taras\u2019 undivided one-half interest in the home is also subject to Cadle\u2019s second priority judicial lien in the amount of $18,911.54. Moreover, there is a third priority Internal Revenue Service (IRS) tax lien of $389,168 owed by Taras and his wife.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-4\">Section 522(b) of the Bankruptcy Code permits a debtor to claim an exemption in property that is exempt under state or local law. 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 522(b)(2)(A). Under Georgia law, a debtor\u2019s interest in his residence is exempt up to the amount of either $10,000 or $20,000. Ga.Code Ann. \u00a7 44-13-100. The Georgia statute provides that if \u201ctitle to property used for the exemption ... is in one of two spouses who is a debtor, the amount of the exemption hereunder shall be $20,000.00.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Pursuant to this statute, Taras sought an exemption of $20,000 in the residence he owned jointly with his wife.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b194-5\">In addition, \u00a7 522(f)(1) of the Bankruptcy Code allows a debtor to avoid a judicial lien \u201cto the extent that such lien impairs an exemption to which the debtor would have been entitled.\u201d 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 522(f)(1). On the same day Taras filed for bankruptcy, he also moved to avoid the judicial lien held by Cadle, asserting that the lien impaired his home exemption. The bankruptcy court granted Taras\u2019 motion, avoiding Cadle\u2019s judicial lien in its entirety. The district court affirmed. Cadle now appeals the district court\u2019s affirmance of the bankruptcy court\u2019s grant of Taras\u2019 motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-6\">II. STANDARD OF REVIEW We review the bankruptcy court\u2019s findings of fact under the clearly erroneous standard; however, \u201cconclusions of law, whether from the bankruptcy court or the district court, we review de novo.\u201d <em>In re Fretz, </em>244 F.3d 1323, 1326 (11th Cir.2001) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b194-9\">III. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b194-10\">Section 522 of the Bankruptcy Code is designed to provide the debtor with a \u201cfresh start\u201d by protecting the debtor\u2019s exemptions. <em>See Deel Rent-A-Car, Inc. v. Levine, </em>721 F.2d 750, 757 (11th Cir.1983). This Court has explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b194-11\">Section 522 of the Bankruptcy Code, 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 522, sets out a statutory scheme permitting a debtor in bankruptcy to exempt certain property from his or her bankruptcy estate. For property to qualify for an exemption, it must first be part of the bankruptcy estate. If the debtor has mortgaged his or her property, the debtor has retained only an equitable interest in the property. Absent a provision providing otherwise, only that equitable interest would be property of the estate and eligible for an exemption.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b194-12\">Section 522(f), however, provides a special mechanism for the debtor to \u201cavoid\u201d certain hens on property, thereby bringing the whole property within the bankruptcy estate and potentially qualifying it for an exemption.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b194-13\"><em>In re Lehman, </em>205 F.3d 1255, 1256 (11th Cir.2000) (citation omitted). As stated above, \u00a7 522(f) provides that a debtor may avoid a judicial lien to the extent it impairs an exemption. 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 522(f). In 1994, Congress amended \u00a7 522(f) and added a formula for determining the extent to which a hen impairs an exemption:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b194-14\">(2)(A) For the purposes of this subsection, a lien shah be considered to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>impair an exemption to the extent that the sum of\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b195-5\">(i) the lien;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b195-6\">(ii) all other hens on the property; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b195-7\">(hi) the amount of the exemption that the debtor could claim if there were no hens on the property; exceeds the value that the debtor\u2019s interest in the property would have in the absence of any hens.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b195-8\">11 U.S.C. \u00a7 522(f)(2)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b195-9\">In this case, even though the tax hen is junior to Cadle\u2019s judicial hen, the bankruptcy court found that the tax hen should be included in the calculation under \u00a7 522(f)(2)(A). Thus, in calculating the amount of the impairment, the bankruptcy court included Taras\u2019 half of the tax hen, or $194,584. When the tax hen is included in the calculation, the sum of the hens and the exemption greatly exceeds Taras\u2019 interest in the property. As a result, the bankruptcy court granted Taras\u2019 motion, concluding Cadle\u2019s judicial lien can be avoided in its entirety.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-10\">On appeal, Cadle argues the bankruptcy court, and subsequently the district court, erred in finding the junior tax hen is included in the calculation under \u00a7 522(f)(2)(A). Cadle contends state priority rules must be considered in determining whether its judicial hen impairs Taras\u2019 home exemption. According to Cadle, junior unavoidable hens, like the tax hen in this case, should not be included in the computation of the impairment. Using this approach, the junior tax lien should have been removed from the impairment calculation, and no amount of Cadle\u2019s judicial hen would be avoided.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-14\">In <em>In re Kolich, </em>328 F.3d 406 (8th Cir. 2003), the Eighth Circuit considered whether hens junior to the judicial hen in question should be included in the calculation under \u00a7 522(f)(2)(A).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The court pointed out that subsection 522(f)(2)(A)(ii) states the computation of the impairment shah include \u201call other hens on the property.\u201d The Eighth Circuit interpreted the term \u201call other hens on the property\u201d to include junior hens. 328 F.3d at 410; <em>see also In re Smith, </em>315 B.R. 636, 641 (Bankr.D.Mass.2004) (holding \u00a7 522(f)(2) \u201cdoes not distinguish between senior hens and junior hens, between those having greater and lesser priority under state law\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b195-15\">Cadle contests the Eighth Circuit\u2019s interpretation and argues subsection 522(f)(2)(B) implicitly requires courts to consider state priority rules when applying the statutory formula.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> As an initial matter, we note subsection (B) of 522(f)(2) does not refer to the priority position of hens under state law. Rather, that subsection simply states when hens have already been avoided, they should not be considered in the impairment calculation. 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 522(f)(2)(B). In <em>Kolich, </em>the Eighth Circuit explained if Congress had intended to exclude junior hens from the calculation, it could have easily incorporated such language. 328 F.3d at 410 (\u201cThis problem may not be dismissed as a mere <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>\u2018quirk in drafting,\u2019 because it would have been relatively easy to draft \u00a7 522(f)(2)(A)(ii) to exclude such junior consensual liens from the phrase \u2018all other hens on the property.\u2019 \u201d); <em>see also Smith, </em>315 B.R. at 641 (\u201c[Section 522(f)(2)(B)] excluded only those [hens] that have already been avoided\u2014that is, those which are no longer hens. It did not instruct the Court to exclude junior unavoidable hens, and this does not appear to have been for lack of attention to detail.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b196-4\">The Eighth Circuit further explained that when Congress enacted the statutory formula in \u00a7 522(f), it specifically intended to disrupt hen priorities created by state law. 328 F.3d at 410. The court concluded the inclusion of junior hens advanced the statutory purpose of \u00a7 522(f):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b196-5\">To be sure, the Bankruptcy Code usually looks to state law to define the property rights and priorities of creditors, including secured creditors. But \u00a7 522(f) is an exception to that policy. It was enacted to permit the avoidance of judicial hens that can interfere with the debtor\u2019s post-petition fresh start. This selective avoidance gives an advantage under federal law to secured creditors holding consensual hens, typically, residential mortgage lenders. But Congress intended to treat consensual lien-holders more favorably, because their contractual relationships with the bankruptcy debtor typically allow the debtor to acquire equity in the exempt property by making post-petition mortgage payments. The 1994 amendment creating the statutory formula here at issue was expressly aimed at overruling prior judicial decisions compromising that intent.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ag8\"><em>Id. </em>(citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b196-6\">We agree with the Eighth Circuit and apply its reasoning-here. We conclude the bankruptcy court correctly included Taras\u2019 half of the junior tax hen, $194,584, when it computed the extent to which Taras\u2019 home exemption was impaired under the statutory formula in \u00a7 522(f)(2)(A). Because the tax hen is included in the calculation, the sum of the hens and the amount of the exemption substantiahy exceeds Taras\u2019 interest in the property. Therefore, we agree with the bankruptcy court\u2019s conclusion that Cadle\u2019s judicial hen of $18,911.54 impairs Taras\u2019 home exemption and can be avoided in its entirety.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-8\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b196-9\">Because the bankruptcy court and the district court correctly interpreted and applied the statutory formula in \u00a7 522(f)(2)(A), we discern no reversible error. Accordingly, we affirm the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b193-17\">. Before the bankruptcy court, Taras contended the value of the home was $170,000, and Cadle asserted the residence was worth $213,000. The bankruptcy court construed this issue in favor of Cadle and applied the higher valuation of $213,000. The court noted that regardless of which figure is used, the result will be the same.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b194-7\">. Taras initially claimed an exemption of $507,000. The bankruptcy court, however, found this figure to be \"a scrivener's error\u201d because it exceeded the value of the residence and because Taras claimed the exemption under the Georgia statute which permits a maximum exemption of $20,000.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b195-11\">. The parties have not identified any other federal circuit court which has addressed this precise issue. This Court\u2019s decision in <em>In re Lehman, </em>205 F.3d 1255 (11th Cir.2000) did not address the issue now before us. As the Eighth Circuit pointed out, <em>Lehman </em>was concerned with \"the formula\u2019s mathematical progression,\u201d and not with the impact of third priority or junior liens. <em>Kolich, </em>328 F.3d at 409-10.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b195-17\">. This subsection states: \"In the case of a property subject to more than 1 lien, a lien that has been avoided shall not be considered in making the calculation under subparagraph (A) with respect to other liens.\u201d 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 522(f)(2)(B).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
