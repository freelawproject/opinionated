In rejecting Mendes\u2019 applications, the IJ found that Mendes lacked credibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b994-18\">Generally, we review the decision of the BIA and will consider the underlying decision of the IJ only if it influenced the BIA\u2019s determination. <em>Mikhael v. INS, </em>115 F.3d 299, 302 (5th Cir.1997). When, as in this case, the BIA adopts the IJ\u2019s decision without a written opinion, we review the IJ\u2019s decision. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b994-23\">The IJ articulated cogent reasons, supported by substantial evidence in the record, for rejecting Mendes\u2019 testimony as incredible. <em>See Chun v. INS, </em>40 F.3d 76, 79 (5th Cir.1994). Absent credible testimony by Mendes, substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s determination that Mendes failed to establish that she was eligible for asylum and withholding of removal. <em>See id. </em>Because Mendes makes only a conclusory statement that she is entitled to relief under the CAT, she has shown no error in the IJ\u2019s denial of relief under the CAT. <em>See Efe v. Ashcroft, </em>293 F.3d 899, 907 (5th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b994-24\">Accordingly, her petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b994-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
