She appeals her 120-month sentence, arguing that the district court erred when it disqualified her from the benefit of the safety-valve provision in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5C1.2 by finding that she possessed a firearm in connection with the offense. For the reasons set forth more fully below, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-23\">Skinner signed a factual statement with her plea containing the following information. A confidential informant made several purchases of methamphetamine from Skinner\u2019s codefendant and co-conspirator, Tracy Cotrell, and Skinner was present at each transaction, discussing the quality of the drugs, looking for surveillance cameras, and counting proceeds from at least one transaction. On February 12, 2001, Skinner carried a Smith <em>&amp; </em>Wesson .357 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>revolver and 22 rounds of ammunition into a motel room, where Cotrell sold the weapon contemporaneous to a drug transaction. Both Cotrell and Skinner were arrested on March 15, 2001, and admitted to their participation in methamphetamine dealing. After conducting a Rule 11 hearing, the district court accepted Skinner\u2019s guilty plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-5\">The pre-sentence investigation report (\u201cPSI\u201d) calculated a base offense level of 82, finding that the offense involved at least 50 but less than 150 grams of methamphetamine, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c)(4). A two-level enhancement was added for possession of a dangerous weapon pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1(b)(1). Finally, Skinner received both a two-level minor-role reduction and a three-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility, for a total offense level of 29, U .S.S.G. \u00a7\u00a7 3B1.2(b), 3El.l(a), (b). Notably, the PSI found that Skinner did not qualify for a two-level reduction under \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(6) because she did not meet the criteria for the safety-valve provision in \u00a7 5C1.2.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Specifically, the PSI found that Skinner knowingly possessed and transported a firearm that Cotrell later sold, in conjunction with a drug transaction, to an individual believed to be a drug dealer, disqualifying her from the benefits of \u00a7 5C1.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-6\">Skinner objected to the PSI\u2019s safety-valve finding, arguing that the firearm transaction was separate from the drug offense, and thus, should not be considered in determining her eligibility under that section. To address her objection, the government called Detective Ed Cook, who worked undercover in the drug and firearm transaction, to present testimony in support of its position that the firearm was connected with the drug offense. Cook testified that he worked undercover while investigating Skinner and Cotrell, and discovered through a confidential informant that Cotrell might be willing to sell a couple of handguns. On February 4, 2001, during a drug transaction with Skinner and Cotrell, Cook discussed purchasing a .357 revolver from Cotrell. Cook advised Cotrell that he could not purchase a weapon legally, wanted a firearm for protection, and \u201calso talked about using it while hunting.\u201d Cook arranged for Cotrell to bring the firearm to their next meeting, which was on February 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-9\">On February 12, Cotrell and Skinner met with Cook at a motel, where Cotrell handed Cook suspected methamphetamine. At the same meeting, Skinner produced a gun ease out of a backpack that she carried into the room and handed it to Cotrell, who then handed it over to Cook. The case contained a Smith &amp; Wesson .357 and a partial box of shells. Cook then purchased the weapon and ammunition, as well as four ounces of methamphetamine. Cook further testified that Cotrell, not Skinner, consummated the sale of the gun, and that Skinner never used the firearm. He also stated that Skinner could not have handed him the gun directly from where she was sitting.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-10\">Next, the government called Drug Enforcement Agent Poore, who was in charge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>of the DEA\u2019s investigation of Skinner and Cotrell. He testified that Skinner and Cotrell consented to a search of their mobile home, where agents recovered two firearms: a J.C. Higgins, Model 20, .12 gauge shotgun in a workroom and an Arminius .22 caliber eight-shot revolver, discovered in a dresser drawer that contained both men\u2019s and women\u2019s clothing. Loose ammunition was also found in various locations.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-4\">Neither the government nor Skinner presented further evidence, and the court heard argument from Skinner as to why she should be afforded the benefit of the safety-valve provisions in \u00a7 5C1.2. Skinner argued that the gun sale and the drug transaction were completely separate incidents, and the gun should not be considered under subsection \u00a7 5C1.2 as being possessed \u201cin connection with\u201d the drug offense. She further argued that, while the gun purchaser may have intended to use the gun to protect himself during drug dealings, Cotrell was responsible for the sale, not Skinner. Skinner argued that she was \u201ca puppy\u201d and a drug addict who was a tool in Cotrell\u2019s crimes. Finally, Skinner argued that, while she possessed the weapon that eventually was sold, it was for a short period of time and not part of the conspiracy to sell methamphetamine.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-5\">The government argued that Eleventh Circuit precedent placed the burden on the defendant to prove that the safety valve applies, and that Skinner clearly possessed the firearm in question and assisted in giving that firearm and ammunition to a person she knew or believed to be a drug dealer. It further argued that Skinner knew that Cook could not obtain a gun legally, that he wanted it for protection, and that she knew, based on the previous week\u2019s dealings, that the gun was going to be sold along with the drugs. Finally, the government argued that it did not have to prove that the firearm facilitated the drug deal, but merely that Skinner possessed the firearm, and Skinner had to prove that the connection between the firearm and the drug deal was clearly improbable, which she had not done.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-7\">The court overruled Skinner\u2019s objection, and found that the issue was whether Skinner possessed the firearm or induced another person to do so. <em>(Id. </em>at 27). It noted that, in resolving the issue in question under \u00a7 5C1.2, other circuits had applied the light standard under guidelines section 2Dl.l(b)(l), providing an enhancement if \u201ca dangerous weapon (including a firearm) was possessed.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at 28). The court found it was \u201cvery clear that having a .357 handgun in one\u2019s hand at the time of a drug transaction with ammunition right there meets\u201d the standard for an enhancement under \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(l), and, therefore, Skinner did not qualify for a safety-valve reduction under \u00a7 5C1.2. <em>(Id.).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b678-8\">However, the court further stated that its ruling did not rest on the standards of \u00a7 2D1.1(b)(1) and \u00a7 5C1.2 being the same, and made additional findings that Skinner knew that Cook wanted a firearm for protection and could not obtain a firearm legally, knew that she was possessing a weapon with ammunition at the time she entered the motel room to consummate a drug transaction, and knew that the weapon was going to be sold at the moment she handed the weapon to Cotrell. Based on those findings, the court found that \u201cit was clear ... that they were selling a firearm to a person believed to be a drug dealer at the time of the drug transaction. By whatever standard measure, that constitutes possession of a firearm by Ms. Skinner in connection with the drug transaction.\u201d It went on to note that \u00a7 5C1.2 only requires possession, not use of the firearm, and that even if use were required, the firearm \u201cwas used to facilitate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>a relationship in a transaction with the drug customer.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b679-5\">Based on the foregoing, the court found that Skinner\u2019s PSI was accurate, and sentenced her to the statutory minimum of 120 months\u2019 imprisonment, with judgment entered on August 17, 2001. On August 2, 2002, Skinner filed a <em>pro se </em>motion to vacate, set aside, or correct her federal sentence under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. She argued that her counsel had been ineffective by failing to file a notice of appeal regarding downward departure issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-6\">Upon review, the district court granted Skinner\u2019s motion, vacated the original judgment, and re-imposed an amended judgment with the exact same sentence, thus reopening the period for Skinner to file an appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-7\">On appeal, Skinner argues that the district court erred by failing to consider her \u201cintent\u201d when it decided that she possessed a firearm \u201cin connection with\u201d a drug offense, thereby disqualifying her from receiving the benefits of the safety-valve provisions in \u00a7 5C1.2. Specifically, Skinner argues that the district court did not examine why she possessed the gun, and instead improperly attributed Cotrell\u2019s intent to her in making its findings. Skinner admits that her argument may be foreclosed by this Court\u2019s precedent, which holds that an individual\u2019s purpose in possessing a firearm is irrelevant, but submits that this precedent is contrary to the requirements of the guidelines, the United States Code, and the position of 10 other circuit courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-8\">We review for clear error the district coui't\u2019s factual findings that the defendant failed to meet his burden of proving that she qualified for a safety-valve reduction. <em>See also United States v. Cruz, </em>106 F.3d 1553, 1557 (11th Cir.1997). Legal interpretations of the guidelines are reviewed <em>de novo. United States v. Johnson, </em>375 F.3d 1300, 1301 (11th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b679-10\">The \u201csafety-valve\u201d provision found in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5C1.2 permits a court to sentence a defendant within the applicable guidelines range and without regard to the statutory minimum sentences set out in 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841, 844, 846, 960, or 963, if the court finds that the defendant meets all of the criteria set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(f)(l)-(5). Among those criteria, and the one relevant on appeal, is that the defendant \u201cdid not use violence or credible threats of violence <em>or possess a firearm or other dangerous weapon (or induce another participant to do so) in connection with the offense.\u201d </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5C1.2(a)(2) (emphasis supplied). The term \u201cdefendant\u201d limits the accountability of the defendant to \u201chis own conduct and conduct that he aided or abetted, counseled, commanded, induced, procured, or wilfully caused.\u201d <em>Id., </em>comment, n. 4. The burden is on the defendant to prove she meets the eligibility requirements under \u00a7 5C1.2. <em>Cruz, </em>106 F.3d at 1557.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-11\">The guidelines do not define what is required to prove that a firearm was possessed \u201cin connection with\u201d the offense for purposes of \u00a7 5C1.2, and we do not appear to have explicitly addressed the question. In <em>United States v. Young, </em>however, we held that the phrase \u201cin connection with\u201d in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.4(b)(3)(A) (armed career criminal) required only that the defendant possess a firearm during the commission of a crime of violence to warrant application of the enhancement. <em>United States v. Young, </em>115 F.3d 834, 837-38 (11th Cir. 1997). In doing so, we rejected the rationale of other circuits that required the government to prove that the firearm served a purpose related to the crime, i.e., that the weapon facilitated the commission of the offense. <em>Id. </em>at 838; <em>see, e.g., United States v. Wyatt, </em>102 F.3d 241, 247 (7th <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>Cir.1996) (comparing \u201cin connection with\u201d to \u201cin relation to\u201d and concluding that \u201cin connection with\u201d requires that a firearm serve some purpose to the felonious conduct before an enhancement is warranted under \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(5)).</p>\n<p id=\"b680-4\">In a slightly different context, we were \u201cunable to discern any principled reason why we should follow a path of reasoning different from that marked by our decision in <em>[Young], </em>when attempting to arrive at the construction that should be accorded the same \u2018in connection with\u2019 phrase found in \u00a7 2B5.1(b)(3),\u201d requiring an enhancement for a defendant who possessed a firearm in connection with a counterfeit currency offense. <em>United States v. Matos-Rodriguez, </em>188 F.3d 1300, 1308 (11th Cir. 1999). Thus, we reaffirmed our decision in <em>Young </em>and again rejected the view of other circuits holding that the language \u201cin connection with\u201d required something more than mere use or possession. <em>Id. </em>at 1308-09.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-5\">Likewise, in <em>-United States v. Rhind, </em>we reiterated that the ordinary and natural meaning of the phrase \u201cin connection with\u201d does not require proof of facilitation, this time interpreting U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(5).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>United States v. Rhind, </em>289 F.3d 690, 695 (11th Cir.2002). Thus, while we have not explicitly ruled on the meaning of the phrase \u201cin connection with\u201d in the context of \u00a7 5C1.2, it seems counterintuitive and inconsistent to afford the same phrase a different meaning solely because the guidelines section is different from the sections at issue in previous cases, especially where \u00a7 5C1.2 is silent on the definition.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-6\">Furthermore, as we have noted, in some instances the test for whether a firearm was possessed \u201cin connection with\u201d another offense doesn\u2019t matter, as the evidence would support a district court\u2019s finding under either a \u201cfacilitation\u201d or \u201cmere possession\u201d approach. <em>See United States v. Gainey, </em>111 F.3d 834, 837 (11th Cir.1997) (declining to adopt an interpretation of \u201cin connection with\u201d as used in \u00a7 4B1.4(b)(3)(A) and finding that the district court did not clearly err under any of the prevailing interpretations). Here, Skinner had to prove that she was eligible for the benefits of \u00a7 5C1.2 by proving that her possession of the weapon had no connection with the drug offense. <em>See Cruz, </em>106 F.3d at 1557. To meet her burden, Skinner purports to rely on the testimony of Cook during the sentencing hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-10\">Based on Cook\u2019s testimony, it was not clear error for the district court to find that Skinner possessed a firearm in connection with the drug offense. Cook testified that Skinner was present at a February 4, 2001, drug sale, where Cook discussed purchasing a .357 revolver from Cotrell. Because she was present at that meeting, the inference drawn by the district court was that Skinner knew that Cook could not purchase a gun legally and that he wanted the firearm for, among other things, protection. Furthermore, she knew that Cotrell and Cook had arranged for the .357 to be brought to their next meeting on February 12. At the February 12 meeting, \u25a0Skinner carried a backpack and produced a .357 revolver with ammunition from that backpack and handed it to Cotrell, who was seated next to Cook at the time.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-11\">Skinner offered no testimony of her own to explain any of the events on February 4 and February 12, and thus, it cannot be said that the district court clearly erred by finding that Skinner knew that Cook wanted a firearm for protection and could not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>obtain a firearm legally, knew that she was possessing a weapon with ammunition at the time she entered the motel room to consummate a drug transaction, and knew that the weapon was going to be sold at the moment she handed the weapon to Cotrell. This is true even if the district court erred by equating Skinner\u2019s burden of proof under \u00a7 5C1.2 to \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(l). <em>See, e.g., United States v. Bolka, </em>355 F.3d 909, 914-15 (6th Cir.2004) (persuasively explaining that application of \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(l) does not foreclose a safety-valve reduction under \u00a7 5C1.2, but that the district court\u2019s refusal to apply one was harmless where the defendant failed to demonstrate entitlement to it, in any event).</p>\n<p id=\"b681-5\">As we have acknowledged \u201ca similar fact pattern may on occasion give rise to two reasonable and different constructions.... As the Supreme Court has recognized, a trial court\u2019s choice between \u2018two permissible views of the evidence\u2019 is the very essence of the clear error standard of review.\u201d <em>United States v. De Varon, </em>175 F.3d 930, 942 (11th Cir.1999) <em>(en banc). </em>Skinner failed to offer any evidence to meet her burden of proof, and the testimony she relies upon reasonably supports the district court\u2019s conclusion that she possessed a firearm \u201cin connection with\u201d the offense, whether such a finding required \u201cmere possession\u201d (which even she admits she had) or \u201cfacilitation.\u201d The district court reasonably could have concluded that the firearm sold facilitated a relationship with a known drug dealer, or, at the very least, a known buyer, thus constituting an overt act in furtherance of the conspiracy to distribute drugs. As such, the district court did not clearly err by denying Skinner the benefit of a safety-valve reduction under \u00a7 5C1.2. Lastly, to the extent Skinner argues that the court should have considered her intent, the plain language of \u00a7 5C1.2, does not require any proof of intent, only possession of the firearm \u201cin connection with\u201d the offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-7\">Based on the foregoing, we conclude that the district court did not clearly err by finding that Skinner possessed a firearm in connection with the offense and, therefore, did not err by denying Skinner the benefit of the safety-valve provisions of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5C1.2. We, therefore, affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b677-7\">. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5C1.2 allows the court to impose a sentence without regard to the statutory minimum if the defendant meets the following criteria: (1) has not more than one criminal history point; (2) did not use violence, threats of violence, or possess a firearm or other dangerous weapon in connection with the offense; (3) the offense did not result in death or serious bodily injury to anyone; (4) the defendant was not a leader or supervisor; and (5) the defendant truthfully provided all information and evidence to the government relevant to the offense. In addition, the defendant receives a two-level reduction in the offense level determined under \u00a7 2D 1.1. See \u00a7 2D1.1(b)(6) (\"If the defendant meets the criteria ... of \u00a7 5C1.2 ... decrease by 2 levels\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b680-7\">.
