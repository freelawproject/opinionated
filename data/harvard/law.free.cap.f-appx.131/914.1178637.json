Gross seeks to appeal the district court\u2019s order denying his motion filed under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 (2000) in which he claimed there was insufficient evidence to support his conviction. An appeal may not be taken from the final order in a \u00a7 2254 proceeding unless a circuit justice or judge issues a certificate of appealability. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(1) (2000). A certificate of appealability will not issue absent \u201ca substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2) (2000). A prisoner satisfies this standard by demonstrating that reasonable jurists would find that his constitutional claims are debatable and that any dispositive procedural rulings by the district court are also debatable or wrong. <em>See Miller-El v. Cockrell, </em>537 U.S. 322, 336, 123 S.Ct. 1029, 154 L.Ed.2d 931 (2003); <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000); <em>Rose v. Lee, </em>252 F.3d 676, 683 (4th Cir.2001). We have independently reviewed the record and conclude that Gross has not made the requisite showing. Accordingly, we deny a certificate of appealability and dismiss the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b941-12\">In addition, Gross raises an ineffective assistance of counsel claim for the first time in his appeal to this court. Because this claim was not raised in the district court, Gross may not raise it now on appeal. <em>See Muth v. United States, </em>1 F.3d 246, 250 (4th Cir.1993). Accordingly, we deny a certificate of appealability and dismiss as to this claim as well. We deny Gross\u2019 motion for appointment of counsel. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b941-14\">\n<em>DISMISSED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
