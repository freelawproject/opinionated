To obtain reversal of a determination denying eligibility for relief, an alien must show that \u201cthe evidence presented was so compelling that no reasonable fact-finder could fail to find the requisite fear of persecution.\u201d <em>Rusu v. INS, </em>296 F.3d 316, 325 n. 14 (4th Cir.2002) (quoting <em>Huaman-Comelio v. Bd. of Immigration Appeals, </em>979 F.2d 995, 999 (4th Cir.1992) (internal quotation marks omitted)). We have reviewed the record and conclude that Ngah fails to demonstrate that the evidence compels a contrary result. Accordingly, we cannot grant the relief that Ngah seeks.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-11\">In addition, we conclude that Ngah\u2019s claim that the Board\u2019s summary affirmance of the IJ\u2019s decision violated her due process rights is foreclosed by our decision in <em>Blanco de Belbruno v. Ashcroft, </em>362 F.3d 272 (4th Cir.2004). In <em>Blanco de Belbruno, </em>we held that \u201cthe BIA\u2019s streamlining regulations do not violate an alien\u2019s rights to due process of law under the Fifth Amendment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 282-83.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-12\">Accordingly, we deny the petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-13\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b448-10\"> The immigration judge also found Ngah\u2019s application to be frivolous. This aspect of the decision was overruled by the Board, and Ngah does not challenge this issue on appeal. <em>See United States v. Al-Hamdi, </em>356 F.3d 564, 571 n. 8 (4th Cir.2004) (stating that issue not raised on appeal is waived); <em>Edwards v. City of Goldsboro, </em>178 F.3d 231, 241 n. 6 (4th Cir.1999) (same). Ngah\u2019s appeal is therefore limited to the denial of her application for asylum, withholding of removal and protection under the CAT, in addition to her due process claim.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
