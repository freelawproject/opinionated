The district court has granted a certificate of appealability as to Clark\u2019s argument that he was denied the effective assistance of counsel when counsel failed to argue that one of Clark\u2019s prior convictions was not for a crime of violence, and therefore was erroneously counted as a predicate offense to his career offender enhancement. <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 4B1.1 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b56-17\">The statute under which Clark was convicted, entitled \u201cFelonious Assault,\u201d provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b56-18\">(A) No person shall knowingly do either of the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b56-19\">(1) Cause serious physical harm to another or to another\u2019s unborn;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b56-20\">(2) Cause or attempt to cause physical harm to another or to another\u2019s unborn by means of a deadly weapon or dangerous ordnance.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b56-21\">Ohio Rev.Code Ann. \u00a7 2903.11(A) (Anderson 1996). \u2022 Although Clark was originally charged with aggravated felonious assault with a firearm, the offense to which he pled guilty did not include the aggravated nature of the offense and also deleted the reference to the firearm. However, by its terms, \u00a7 2903.11 is a crime that involves the causing of serious physical injury or the attempt to cause physical injury by use of a deadly weapon. Thus Clark\u2019s prior conviction under this statute constitutes a crime of violence under USSG \u00a7 4B1.1. <em>See </em>USSG \u00a7 4B1.2, comment. (n.l); <em>United States v. Pierce, </em>278 F.3d 282, 288-89 (4th Cir.2002); <em>see also </em>USSG \u00a7 4B1.2(a)(2) (defining crime of violence to include any offense \u201cthat presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b56-22\">Because the statute under which Clark was convicted categorically constitutes a crime of violence, any objection by counsel to counting this conviction as a crime of violence would have been futile. Thus, Clark cannot show that he was prejudiced <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>by any deficiencies in counsel\u2019s performance. <em>See Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 688-89, 694, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s denial of relief on this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-5\">With regard to the other issues Clark seeks to argue on appeal, an appeal may not be taken from the final order in a \u00a7 2255 proceeding unless a circuit justice or judge issues a certificate of appealability. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(1) (2000). A certificate of appealability will not issue absent \u201ca substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2) (2000). A prisoner satisfies this standard by demonstrating that reasonable jurists would find that the district court\u2019s assessment of his constitutional claims is debatable or wrong and that any dispositive procedural rulings by the district court are also debatable or wrong. <em>See Miller-El v. Cockrell, </em>537 U.S. 322, 336, 123 S.Ct. 1029, 154 L.Ed.2d 931 (2003); <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000); <em>Rose v. Lee, </em>252 F.3d 676, 683 (4th Cir.2001). We have independently reviewed the record and conclude that Clark has not made the requisite showing. Accordingly, we decline to expand the certificate of appealability beyond that granted by the district court, we deny a certificate of appealability, deny Clark\u2019s motion for appointment of counsel, and dismiss the appeal in part. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED IN PART; DISMISSED IN PART</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
