The district court sentenced her to 151 months\u2019 imprisonment and 5 years\u2019 supervised release. Garfield appealed her sentence, and this Court affirmed. <em>United States v. Garfield, </em>No. 99-12418, 216 F.3d 1091, 216 F.3d 1091 (11th Cir. May 16, 2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b706-6\">On or about July 23, 2001, Garfield filed the instant \u00a7 2255 motion raising challenges to both her conviction and sentence, including a Sixth Amendment challenge to the determination of drug quantity at sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-7\">On December 12, 2003, the magistrate judge issued a report recommending that the district court deny Garfield\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion. On January 20, 2004, the district court adopted the magistrate judge\u2019s report in its entirety and denied Garfield\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion. Garfield filed a motion in the district court for a COA, which the district court also denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-13\">After the district court denied Garfield\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion and motion for a COA, the Supreme Court decided <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S.-, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), on June 24, 2004. <em>Blakely </em>extended the rule in <em>Apprendi </em>and concluded that \u201cthe \u2018statutory maximum\u2019 for <em>Apprendi </em>purposes is the maximum sentence a judge may impose <em>solely on the basis of the facts reflected in the jury verdict or admitted by the defendant.\u201d Blakely, </em>124 S.Ct. at 2537 (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b706-15\">This Court initially denied Garfield\u2019s application for a COA. On August 9, 2004, however, this Court reconsidered its denial and granted Garfield\u2019s motion for a COA on the following issue: \u201cIs <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), retroactive to cases on collateral review pursuant to <em>Teague v. Lane, </em>489 U.S. 288, 109 S.Ct. 1060, 103 L.Ed.2d 334 (1989)?\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b706-18\">On appeal, Garfield argues that <em>Blakely </em>is available to her on collateral review.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-19\">When reviewing the denial of a \u00a7 2255 motion, this Court \u201creview[s] questions of law <em>de novo </em>and findings of fact for clear error.\u201d <em>Varela v. United States, </em>400 F.3d 864, 867 n. 3 (11th Cir.2005). In <em>Varela, </em>this Court held that <em>\u201cBooker\u2019s </em>[and <em>Blakely\u2019s] </em>constitutional rule falls squarely un<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number>der the category of new rules of criminal procedure that do not apply retroactively to \u00a7 2255 cases on collateral review.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 868. Accordingly, we affirm the denial of Garfield\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b706-8\">. Because Garfield filed her motion after the effective date of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (\"AEDPA\u201d), Pub. L. No. 104-132, 110 Stat. 1214 (1996), the provisions of that act apply.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b706-9\">. After we issued Garfield a COA, the Supreme Court further explained that the holding in <em>Blakely </em>applies to the Federal Sentencing Guidelines. <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). To the extent Garfield\u2019s appeal turns on the application of <em>Blakely, </em>it also turns on the application of <em>Booker.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b706-20\">Further, in addition to the issue stated above, this Court also granted a COA on two other issues: (1) \"[I]s appellant procedurally barred from reusing the instant constitutional challenge to her sentence because it was not raised on direct appeal?\u201d; and (2) \"If the claim is not procedurally barred, does appellant\u2019s 151-month sentence violate <em>Apprendi, </em>as explained in <em>Blakely?\u201d </em>Because we have determined that <em>Booker </em>is not retroactive to cases on collateral review, we need not address these two issues.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
