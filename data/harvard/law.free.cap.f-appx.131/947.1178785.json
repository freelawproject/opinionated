Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 481, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992). We will reverse only \u201cif \u2018the evidence presented by the petitioner was so compelling that no reasonable fact finder could fail to find the requisite fear of persecution.\u2019 \u201d <em>Rusu v. INS, </em>296 F.3d 316, 325 n. 14 (4th Cir.2002) (quoting <em>Huaman-Cornelio v. Board of Immigration Appeals, </em>979 F.2d 995, 999 (4th Cir.l992)(internal quotation marks omitted)). To qualify for withholding of removal, Patel must show a clear probability of persecution because of his race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion. <em>Rusu, </em>296 F.3d at 324 n. 13 (citing <em>INS v. Stevic, </em>467 U.S. 407, 430, 104 S.Ct. 2489, 81 L.Ed.2d 321 (1984)). We find substantial evidence supports the Board\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b974-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"948\">*948</page-number>Protection under the CAT is generally granted in the form of withholding of removal. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.16(c) (2004). An applicant must establish that it is more likely than not that he would be tortured if removed to the proposed country of removal. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.16(c)(2). Again, we find the Board\u2019s finding is supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b974-4\">Accordingly, we deny the petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b974-5\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b973-25\"> Patel does not challenge the specific finding he was not eligible for asylum.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
