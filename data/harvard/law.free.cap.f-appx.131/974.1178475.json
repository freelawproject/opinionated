Wilhelm has not shown clear error in the district court\u2019s factual finding that he stole the firearm at issue. <em>See United States v. Angeles-Mendoza, </em>407 F.3d 742 (5th Cir.2005). Thus, the district court did not err in assessing a two-level increase in Wilhelm\u2019s offense level. <em>See United States v. Luna, </em>165 F.3d 316, 324-25 (5th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b1001-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"975\">*975</page-number>Wilhelm argues that his sentence violates <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), because it was increased on the basis that the handgun was stolen, a finding that was not made by a jury. After completion of briefing in this case, the Supreme Court decided <em>United States v. Booker, </em>\u2014 U.S. -,-, 125 S.Ct. 738, 756, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), which applied the Sixth Amendment holding in <em>Blakely </em>to the federal sentencing guidelines and made the guidelines advisory instead of mandatory.</p>\n<p id=\"b1001-7\">Because Wilhelm did not raise his <em>Blakely </em>claim in the district court, it is reviewed only for plain error. <em>See United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 513 (5th Cir .2005), <em>petition for cert. filed </em>(U.S. Mar. 31, 2005) (No. 04-9517). \u201c[Wilhelm] has not shown, with a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome, that if the judge had sentenced him under an advisory sentencing regime rather than a mandatory one, he would have received a lesser sentence.\u201d <em>United States v. Infante, </em>404 F.3d 376, 394-95 (5th Cir.2005). Wilhelm has not satisfied his burden of establishing plain error. Thus, he is not entitled to resentencing on this ground. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1001-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1000-26\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
