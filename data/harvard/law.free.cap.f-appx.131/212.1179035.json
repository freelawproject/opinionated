Anderson appeals his conviction and 188-month sentence for possession of a firearm by a convicted felon, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1). On appeal, Anderson challenges the district court\u2019s denial of his motion to suppress evidence, as well as the constitutionality of his sentence. Although we affirm the district court\u2019s evidentiary ruling, Anderson\u2019s preserved <em>Booker </em>challenge requires us to vacate his sentence and remand for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-17\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b239-18\">Prior to trial, Anderson had moved to suppress evidence obtained in connection with a search incident to his arrest. At the suppression hearing, Officer Chad Alexander of the Atlanta Police Department testified he and his partner were flagged down by Bobby Bell, who then told the officers that: (i) a black male, wearing a purple coat and blue jeans, had burglarized the home Bell and his wife were restoring and was walking towards Officer Alexander\u2019s location; (ii) Bell had followed this individual (Anderson) after he had left Bell\u2019s house; and (iii) Bell saw Anderson recover a handgun from his left-front pant pocket and place it in his front coat pocket. Officer Alexander further testified that: (i) after Bell made these statements, Officer Alexander witnessed a black male wearing a purple coat and blue jeans approaching them; (ii) Bell identified that individual as the perpetrator, saying, \u201cthat\u2019s him.\u201d Officer Alexander stated that he and his partner then approached Anderson, who had his hands in his pockets. The police ordered Anderson to remove his hands from his pockets, and because of his reluctance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>to do so, they ordered him to his knees. Alexander then conducted a \u201cquick frisk\u201d of Anderson\u2019s person, during which he felt a hard object with the feel and shape of a handgun. The officers removed the item, which proved to be a loaded semiautomatic weapon. The officers then placed Anderson under arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-4\">To the extent that Alexander\u2019s testimony conflicted with Bell\u2019s own testimony, the magistrate expressly credited Alexander\u2019s testimony, finding that Bell\u2019s equivocations and lapses of memory rendered him a less credible witness. Based on Alexander\u2019s testimony, the magistrate\u2019s report concluded that the officers had probable cause to arrest Alexander and to conduct a lawful warrantless search incident to the arrest. In the alternative, the magistrate concluded that the officers conducted a lawful \u201cstop and frisk,\u201d the results of which then gave them probable cause to arrest Anderson. The magistrate accordingly recommended a denial of Anderson\u2019s suppression motion. The district court adopted the magistrate\u2019s report.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-5\">Following a stipulated bench trial, the district court found Anderson guilty of violating 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1) (2005). At sentencing, the district court found that Anderson had three prior violent felony convictions, subjecting him to the minimum fifteen-year sentence mandated by 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e). The district court granted an additional enhancement beyond the fifteen-year minimum, finding by a preponderance of the evidence that Anderson was using the weapon in connection with burgling Bell\u2019s home\u2014a crime of which Anderson was never convicted.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-6\">Anderson objected to the court\u2019s enhancements based on <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004). The district court overruled Anderson\u2019s <em>Blakely </em>objections, relying on our decision in <em>United States v. Sanchez, </em>269 F.3d 1250 (11th Cir.2001), which held that the principle embodied in <em>Blakely </em>had no application to the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines. After the district court granted an offense-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility, the guidelines range was 188 to 235 months. The district court sentenced Anderson to 188 months in prison, the minimum sentence permissible under the guidelines, but eight months above the statutory minimum sentence prescribed by \u00a7 924(e). Anderson appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-9\">STANDARDS OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b240-10\">\u201cThis court reviews a district court\u2019s denial of a defendant\u2019s motion to suppress under a mixed standard of review, reviewing the district court\u2019s findings of fact under the clearly erroneous standard and the district court\u2019s application of law to those facts <em>de novo.\u201d United States v. Desir, </em>257 F.3d 1233, 1235-36 (11th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b240-11\">Because Anderson made his <em>Blakely </em>objection before the district court, preserving it for appellate review, we review his sentence de novo, but will reverse and remand only for harmful error. <em>United States v. Riley, </em>250 F.3d 1303, 1307 n. 5 (11th Cir. 2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b240-12\">SUPPRESSION OF THE EVIDENCE</p>\n<p id=\"b240-13\">As a threshold matter, Anderson takes issue with the district court\u2019s findings of fact. Specifically, Anderson points to the conflict between testimony given by Alexander and that given by Bell, contending that Bell\u2019s testimony is more credible than Officer Alexander\u2019s testimony. However, because the trier of fact remains in a superior position to judge a witness\u2019s demeanor and credibility, we defer to a magistrate\u2019s credibility determination in the face of conflicting testimony unless his understanding of the facts appears to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>\u201cunbelievable.\u201d <em>United States v. Ramirez-Chilel, </em>289 F.3d 744, 749 (11th Cir. 2002). Where the record of Bell\u2019s testimony included memory lapses and vacillations in testimony, we certainly cannot say that the magistrate\u2019s version of the facts, which credits Alexander\u2019s testimony, is incredible. Under that version of the facts, it becomes clear that Alexander\u2019s search was permissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-5\">Consistent with the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments, a police officer may conduct a brief, investigatory stop without a warrant when he or she has a \u201creasonable, articulable suspicion\u201d that criminal activity is afoot. <em>Illinois v. Wardlaw, </em>528 U.S. 119, 123, 120 S.Ct. 673, 145 L.Ed.2d 570 (2000). \u201cReasonable suspicion\u201d is a less demanding standard than probable cause and requires considerably less than a preponderance of the evidence. <em>United States v. Sokolow, </em>490 U.S. 1, 7, 109 S.Ct. 1581, 104 L.Ed.2d 1 (1989). However, the officer must be able to articulate a level of objective justification that rises above mere inchoate suspicion. <em>Wardlaw, </em>528 U.S. at 123, citing <em>Terry v. Ohio, </em>392 U.S. 1, 27, 88 S.Ct. 1868, 20 L.Ed.2d 889 (1968). Where such justification exists, the officer may conduct a limited warrant-less search of an individual\u2019s outer clothing in an attempt to discover weapons. <em>Terry, </em>392 U.S. at 30.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-6\">In this case, Alexander clearly possessed \u201creasonable suspicion\u201d to conduct a <em>Terry </em>frisk of Anderson. Bell had flagged down Alexander and informed him that a black male individual wearing a purple coat and blue jeans had burglarized the home he and his wife were restoring, was carrying a concealed gun, and was traveling towards their location. After Bell relayed this information to Alexander, they both witnessed a black male wearing a purple coat and blue jeans coming towards them. Bell identified the individual by saying, \u201cthat\u2019s him.\u201d When Alexander approached, Anderson was resistant to remove his hands from his front pockets. Taken together, this information reasonably suggested to Alexander that Anderson had just committed a burglary and was armed with a concealed weapon. Such information is objectively sufficient to rise to the level of \u201creasonable suspicion\u201d for a <em>Terry </em>frisk. Though Anderson relies on <em>Florida v. J.L., </em>529 U.S. 266, 270, 120 S.Ct. 1375, 146 L.Ed.2d 254 (2000), that case involved information received via telephone from an anonymous informant\u2014an \u201cunknown caller, at an unknown location.\u201d Bell cannot be categorized as an anonymous informant: he personally flagged down Alexander and directly conveyed the information about Anderson. <em>J.L. </em>and its insistence on indicia of an <em>anonymous </em>informer\u2019s reliability are inapposite.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-11\">We thus agree with the district court that Alexander possessed reasonable suspicion of criminal activity, and conducted a permissible <em>Terry </em>frisk on Anderson.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Once the <em>Terry </em>frisk revealed the concealed weapon of which Bell had warned, Alexander had probable cause to arrest Anderson and to conduct a more thorough search incident to that arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-12\">SENTENCING</p>\n<p id=\"b241-13\">\u201cAny fact (other than a prior conviction) which is necessary to support a sentence exceeding the maximum authorized by the facts established by a plea of guilty or a jury verdict must be admitted by the de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>fendant or proved to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>United States v. Booker, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 125 S.Ct. 738, 756, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). Following <em>Booker, </em>the sentencing guidelines are advisory, though a district court must still consult them along with the factors found at 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). <em>Id. </em>at 764-65. However, <em>Booker </em>neither disturbs a district court\u2019s ability to rely on prior convictions to enhance a defendant\u2019s sentence, <em>United States v. Orduno-Mireles, </em>405 F.3d 960, 962 (11th Cir.2005), nor does <em>Booker </em>enable a district court to employ its discretion to impose a sentence below the prescribed statutory minimum. <em>United States v. Shelton, </em>400 F.3d 1325, 1333 n. 10 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b242-5\">We thus reject Anderson\u2019s initial contention that <em>Booker </em>prevented the district court\u2014rather than a jury\u2014from finding his three prior felony convictions. <em>Booker </em>itself makes clear that a district court\u2019s fact-finding as to prior convictions works no Sixth Amendment violation. <em>Booker, </em>125 S.Ct. at 756; <em>see also, Orduno-Mireles, </em>405 F.3d at 962. Thus, there is no constitutional <em>Booker </em>error in the district court\u2019s findings as to Anderson\u2019s prior convictions, nor its consequential application of the \u00a7 924(e)(1) statutory minimum which resulted. Moreover, there can be no non-constitutional \u201cstatutory\u201d <em>Booker </em>error in the district court\u2019s application of \u00a7 924(e)(1), because Booker\u2019s excise of the statutory provision that made the guidelines mandatory left undisturbed statutory m\u00ednimums. <em>Shelton, </em>400 F.3d at 1333 n. 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-7\">We likewise find no merit in Anderson\u2019s argument that <em>Booker </em>requires a jury to find that the predicate convictions qualified as-\u201cviolent felonies\u201d within the meaning of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(2)(b).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> To the contrary, the question of whether the prior felonies qualify as \u201cviolent\u201d remains a matter of law to be determined by the court. This is made clear by the Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision in <em>Shepard v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 125 S.Ct. 1254, 161 L.Ed.2d 205 (2005). <em>Shepard </em>reaffirmed that \u201ca <em>court </em>sentencing under [\u00a7 924(e)] could look to statutory elements, charging documents, and jury instructions to determine whether an earlier conviction\u201d qualified as a violent felony. <em>Shepard, </em>125 S.Ct. at 1257 (emphasis added). While <em>Shepard </em>thus limited the categories of material a court could consider in making its \u201cviolent felony\u201d determination, it in no way unsettled a court\u2019s power to pass on this matter of law or even suggested it was appropriate for jury consideration. <em>Accord United States v. Schlifer, </em>403 F.3d 849, 853 (7th Cir.2005) (refusing to \u201cparse out the recidivism inquiry\u201d where appellant argued that judge\u2019s findings as to whether prior convictions were for crimes of violence violated Sixth Amendment); <em>United States v. Marcussen, </em>403 F.3d 982, 984 (8th Cir.2005) (holding that <em>Shepard </em>\u201clends further support to the rule that the <em>sentencing court, not a jury, </em>must determine whether prior convictions qualify as violent felonies\u201d) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b242-10\">Nonetheless, the district court did engage in fact-finding beyond its conclusion as to Anderson\u2019s prior convictions and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>their status as \u201cviolent felonies\u201d under \u00a7 924(e)(2)(b). Specifically, the district court found by a preponderance of the evidence that Anderson committed burglary of Bell\u2019s residence prior to his arrest, and used the concealed firearm found on his person in connection with that burglary. Though the Georgia courts never convicted Anderson of the burglary offense, the district court relied on testimony presented to the magistrate at the suppression hearing to reach its conclusion as to the burglary and the weapon\u2019s relation thereto. The district court then used those findings to enhance Anderson\u2019s offense level by four points pursuant to \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(5) of the guidelines. In so doing, the district court clearly violated Anderson\u2019s Sixth Amendment rights under <em>Booker. </em>Because Anderson\u2019s objections below preserved this issue, and where the government has not even argued that this <em>Booker </em>error was harmless, we vacate Anderson\u2019s sentence and remand for re-sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-5\">AFFIRMED IN PART; VACATED AND REMANDED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b241-7\">. Because we conclude that Alexander initially had reasonable suspicion to conduct a <em>Terry </em>frisk, and upon discovery of the concealed weapon possessed probable cause to arrest, we need not reach the district court\u2019s alternative holding that Alexander had probable cause to arrest Anderson prior to frisking his person.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b242-6\">. Anderson does not raise his claim, made below, that the predicate aggravated stalking conviction does not satisfy the definition of a \"violent felony\u201d for \u00a7 924 purposes. Nonetheless we note that the Georgia courts have interpreted the aggravated stalking offense (Ga.Code.Ann. \u00a7 16\u20145\u201491 (a)) to require \"a knowing and willful course of conduct directed at a specific person which causes emotional distress by placing such person in reasonable fear of death or bodily harm.\u201d <em>See Fly v. State, 229 </em>Ga.App. 374, 494 S.E.2d 95, 97 (1997).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
