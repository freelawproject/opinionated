Holstick, a federal prisoner, appeals <em>pro se </em>the district court\u2019s denial of his motion to vacate, set aside, or correct his sentence, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. After the district court denied the \u00a7 2255 motion, we granted a certificate of appeal-ability on the following issue: \u201cWhether the district court violated <em>Clisby v. Jones, </em>960 F.2d 925, 938 (11th Cir.1992) <em>(en banc), </em>by failing to address appellant\u2019s claim that the prosecutor improperly stated during closing argument that \u2018Lester Holstick took food off of the government witness Deloris Thomas children table\u2019?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b686-10\">The key question in this appeal is not whether the district court failed to address the claim set out in the COA, but whether the claim was actually raised before the district court at all. We conclude that Holstick has not demonstrated that he raised a separate prosecutorial misconduct claim before the district court. Accordingly the court did not err in failing to reach the claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-11\">Holstick filed his \u00a7 2255 motion and supporting memorandum <em>pro se. </em>In his motion, Holstick lists three grounds for relief: ineffective assistance of counsel, retroactive misjoinder, and the cumulative effect of counsel\u2019s errors. Doc. 1127 at 4. He does not list prosecutorial misconduct as a ground for \u00a7 2255 relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-13\">Section IV of Holstick\u2019s lengthy supporting memorandum is entitled: \u201cPetitioner\u2019s Conviction and Sentence [are] Illegal Because He was Denied Effective Assistance of Counsel as Guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment of the United States Constitution.\u201d Doc. 1128 at 8. Subsection (1) of Section IV is entitled: \u201cCounsel Failed to Object to Prosecutorial Misconduct Before and During Trial.\u201d Doc. 1128 at 8. Within that subsection, Holstick attacks a number of acts by the prosecutor, including the prosecutor\u2019s statement during closing argument that Holstick \u201ctook food off of government witness Deloris Thomas children table.\u201d Doc. 1128 at 12. Immediately thereafter the memorandum talks about manipulating evidence and then states that Holstick was denied ineffective assistance of counsel because his counsel failed to investigate and because his counsel failed to interview the government\u2019s witnesses. Doc. 1128 at 13\u201414. Later in that subsection, Holstick says \u201cif counsel had interviewed Deloris Thomas, counsel would have known that she was being forced to testify as to what ever the prosecutor wanted her to.\u201d Doc. 1128 at 15. Holstick then elaborated on counsel\u2019s duty of independent investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-14\">Holstick\u2019s memorandum also includes an unnumbered section entitled \u201cPrejudice from the ineffective.\u201d Doc. 1128 at 32. In that section, Holstick contends among other things that the prosecutor\u2019s statement about Thomas\u2019 children was prejudicial and \u201cshould have made [his] counsel ask for a mistrial.\u201d Doc. 1128 at 35. The discussions before and after this reference to Thomas concern allegations of his coun<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>sel\u2019s failure to prepare and failure to object to the prosecutor\u2019s alleged misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-5\">The reference to taking food off the table of Thomas\u2019 children in the original memorandum in support of Hostick\u2019s \u00a7 <em>2255 </em>motion is most reasonably construed as presenting an ineffective assistance of counsel claim. That claim in turn is either based on a failure to object to prosecutorial misconduct or on a failure to prepare (through investigation and interviews) such that counsel was unaware of and unable to object to prosecutorial misconduct. The reference is not reasonably construed to include a prosecutorial misconduct claim. We recognize that Holstick does aver that the prosecutor\u2019s statement about Thomas\u2019 children was improper. We think, however, that Holstick had to make a case that the comment was improper in order to lay a foundation for his argument that his own counsel was ineffective for failing to object. These averments do not convert the ineffective assistance of counsel claim into a prosecutorial misconduct claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-6\">Holstick filed several additional pleadings and amendments, which sometimes mention the prosecutor\u2019s statement that Holstick took food away from Deloris Thomas\u2019 children. Those additional filings talk about the statement in passing and often mention both ineffective assistance of counsel and prosecutorial misconduct. Of course, that is not inconsistent with building a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel based on a failure to object to prosecutorial misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-7\">The district court read Holstick\u2019s claim to allege ineffective assistance of counsel. Doc. 1443 at 5\u20147. It rejected that claim because Holstick offered only his eonclusory assertions that any investigation would have been fruitful and because he could not demonstrate that he had been prejudiced. The district court did not read Holstick\u2019s pleadings to include a separate prosecutorial misconduct claim\u2014the claim set out in the COA\u2014and neither do we. Holstick does not point to, and we have not found, any indication in any amendment to his \u00a7 2255 motion and memorandum that he was raising a separate prosecutorial misconduct claim. Although we construe <em>pro se </em>pleadings liberally, we find no basis for a prosecutorial misconduct claim separate from the ineffective assistance of counsel claim. Because we find that Holstick never raised a distinct prosecutorial misconduct claim, the district court could not have erred by failing to address one.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
