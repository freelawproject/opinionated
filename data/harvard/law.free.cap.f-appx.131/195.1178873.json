No. 104-208, 110 Stat. 3009 (1996) (\u201cIIRIRA\u201d), govern her petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-4\">Substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s finding that Hincapie\u2019s testimony was not credible because her testimony was materially inconsistent with her asylum application, her \u201ccredible-fear\u201d interview, and other evidence. Additionally, the IJ did not err in finding that the evidence failed to establish a well-founded fear of persecution, because Hincapie\u2019s additional evidence would not compel a reasonable fact-finder to find that the requisite fear of persecution exists. Moreover, Hincapi\u00e9 has not challenged on appeal of the IJ\u2019s finding that she did not show that relocation within Colombia was not possible. Accordingly, the petition is DENIED.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-5\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b222-6\">On 1 December 2000, Hincapi\u00e9, a native and citizen of Colombia, attempted to enter the United States with her son and grandson without presenting any valid entry documents. According to a record of a sworn statement given on the day of her arrival, Hincapi\u00e9 attested that she came to the United States because she was afraid of living in Colombia. She stated that she would be harmed by the guerillas if she was returned to her home country, because they thought that she was an informant and had threatened the lives of her and her family. She further stated that she did not work outside the home, but that she did some sewing.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-10\">In December 2000, the Immigration and Naturalization Service (\u201cINS\u201d) issued a notice to appear (\u201cNTA\u201d) to Hincapi\u00e9, charging her with removability under the INA \u00a7 212(a)(6)(C)(i), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(6)(C)(i), for seeking to procure a visa, other documentation, or admission into the United States by fraud or willfully misrepresenting a material fact, and under INA \u00a7 212(a)(7)(A)(i)(I), for failing to possess a valid unexpired immigrant visa, reentry permit, border crossing card, or other valid entry document required by the INA. Hincapi\u00e9 submitted to a credible fear interview, in which she attested that, in Colombia, she owned a store where she prepared and sold food. She stated that she was threatened at the store, where she received a letter that said she had informed the military about the guerillas. She further stated that she had not informed the military about the guerillas\u2019 activities. The asylum officer found that Hincapi\u00e9 established a credible fear of persecution on account of her imputed political opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-12\">On 31 October 2001, Hincapi\u00e9 submitted a claim for asylum and withholding of removal, alleging persecution on account of her political opinion and membership in a particular social group. In the application, Hincapi\u00e9 stated that the National Liberation Army (\u201cELN\u201d) threatened her because they believed that she gave information about the guerillas, which she had overheard during their conversations at the store (\u201ckiosko\u201d), to the paramilitary. She further stated that neither she nor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>any of her family had given this information to the paramilitary, because it would have been too dangerous.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-5\">To supplement her application, Hincapi\u00e9 submitted letters from Jesus Helmes Suescun and Luis Eduardo Lopez, customers of the store who stated that Hincapi\u00e9 had confided in them regarding the threats she had received, and a letter from Gloria Cruz Lozada, which stated that Hincapi\u00e9 had worked for three months at a store in the Jamundi area.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-6\">The government submitted copies of round-trip tickets from Cali to Orlando for Hincapi\u00e9, Jhon, and Santiago. In addition, the government submitted copies of: (1) Hincapie\u2019s passport, issued 5 July 1999; (2) Hincapie\u2019s visa, issued April 2000; (3) Jhon\u2019s passport, issued 5 July 1999; (4) Jhon\u2019s visa, issued April 2000; (5) Santiago\u2019s passport, issued 1 August 2000; and (6) Santiago\u2019s visa, issued October 2000.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-7\">At a hearing on Hincapie\u2019s asylum application, Hincapi\u00e9 testified that she thought her visa was good. She testified that she made lingerie and worked at a stand where she prepared food. She further testified that she left Colombia after receiving threatening letters from the ELN. Hincapi\u00e9 stated that she overheard guerillas planning an attack, and four or five days later received an envelope containing a threatening letter. She further stated that she did not inform the police, but that she had informed the military. After receiving another threat two weeks later, she locked up the store and returned home. She testified that she received a telephone call from the ELN a few days later, so she decided to leave. According to Hincapi\u00e9, she did not tell the immigration officer that she had informed the army because she was frightened and had too many problems on her mind. She stated that she had informed the military about the guerillas\u2019 plans, but had not told them of the threats.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-9\">On cross-examination, Hincapi\u00e9 testified that she had not stated on her application for asylum that she had informed the military about the guerillas\u2019 plans because it escaped her mind. She further testified that she obtained her passport and Jhon\u2019s passport in November 2000, and, when asked why the issue date on her passport stated May 1999 and Jhon\u2019s was August 2000, she replied, \u201c[t]hat\u2019s strange.\u201d Administrative Record (\u201cAR\u201d) at 102. She stated that she flew into Orlando so that she could take her grandson to Disney World. In response to questions from the IJ, Hincapi\u00e9 testified that she was not intending to return to Colombia when she left, and that she bought round-trip tickets because \u201cone didn\u2019t know what could happen.\u201d AR at 111-12.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-10\">The IJ denied Hincapie\u2019s application for asylum and withholding of removal and sustained allegation three of the NTA as well as the fraud charge. The IJ found that Hincapie\u2019s claim that she was not aware that the visas and passports were fraudulent was not believable. The IJ found that Hincapie\u2019s testimony regarding when she obtained the passports was inconsistent, because she stated that she received them in November 2000, while the passport of Hincapi\u00e9 and Jhon reflect an issuance date of 5 July 1999, and Santiago\u2019s passport reflects an issuance date of 1 August 2000. The IJ further found that Hincapi\u00e9 was \u201cequivocal\u201d in her testimony as to whether she intended to return to Colombia because she, Jhon, and Santiago had round-trip tickets from Cali to Orlando. AR at 38-39. According to the IJ, Hincapi\u00e9 failed to establish past persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution. The IJ found that Hincapie\u2019s testimony was not credible because it was materially inconsistent regarding whether she had in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>formed the Colombian military of the ELN guerillas\u2019 plans\u2014in her credible fear interview and asylum application she stated that she had not, but during her asylum testimony she stated that she had. The IJ further found that Hincapi\u00e9 stated during her credible fear interview that guerillas had threatened her, but in her asylum application and testimony she claimed that she was threatened by ELN guerillas. The IJ found that Hincapie\u2019s claims of operating the store were not credible because she told the immigration inspector that she did not work outside the home. According to the IJ, Hincapi\u00e9 also failed to show that she could not live elsewhere in Colombia.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-4\">Hincapi\u00e9 appealed to the BIA, arguing that the IJ erred in determining that Hincapi\u00e9 lacked credibility, because her inconsistent statements were not material to the asylum claim. She contended that her testimony showed past persecution and fear of future persecution based on political opinion. The BIA summarily affirmed the IJ\u2019s decision, pursuant to 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(e)(4). This petition for review followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-5\">Hincapi\u00e9 argues on appeal that the IJ erred in finding that she failed to establish a well-founded fear of persecution because she showed that she feared future persecution by the ELN based on an imputed political opinion through her application for asylum, supporting documentation, and testimony. She further contends that the IJ erred in determining that her testimony was not credible, because federal courts have held that credibility does not turn on whether someone has presented a fraudulent document at the border when fleeing persecution. She asserts that the discrepancy caused by the issue dates of the passports and her testimony should not have been considered because the passports were not obtained from the embassy. She argues that her failure to state in her credible fear interview that she informed the military of the impending guerilla attack, as she stated in her testimony, should not be a basis for an adverse credibility determination because the discrepancy was minor and the interview was very brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-7\">When the BIA does not render its own opinion but rather adopts the IJ\u2019s opinion, then we review the IJ\u2019s decision. <em>D-Muhumed v. United States Att\u2019y Gen., </em>388 F.3d 814, 818 (11th Cir.2004). Legal determinations are reviewed <em>de novo. Id. </em>at 817. Factual determinations, including credibility determinations, are reviewed under the substantial evidence test, and we \u201c \u2018must affirm the [ ] decision if it is supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 817-18. Under this highly deferential standard of review, a denial of asylum may be reversed only if the evidence would compel a reasonable factfinder to find that the requisite fear of persecution exists. <em>INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 481 &amp; n. 1, 112 S.Ct. 812, 815 &amp; n. 1, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992). \u201cCredibility determinations likewise are reviewed under the substantial-evidence test.\u201d <em>D-Muhumed, </em>388 F.3d at 818.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-8\">Upon review of the record and upon consideration of the parties\u2019 briefs, we find no reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-9\">An alien who arrives in or is present in the United States may apply for asylum. <em>See </em>INA \u00a7 208(a)(1), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(1). The Attorney General (\u201cAG\u201d) has discretion to grant asylum if the alien meets the INA\u2019s definition of a \u201crefugee.\u201d <em>See </em>INA \u00a7 208(b)(1), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(1). A \u201crefugee\u201d is:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-10\">any person who is outside any country of such person\u2019s nationality or, in the case of a person having no nationality, is outside any country in which such person last habitually resided, and who is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>unable or unwilling to return to, and is unable or unwilling to avail himself or herself of the protection of, that country because of <em>persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of </em>race, religion, nationality, <em>membership in a particular social group, </em>or <em>political opinion....</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b225-5\">8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A) (emphasis added). \u201cThe asylum applicant carries the burden of proving statutory \u2018refugee\u2019 status.\u201d <em>D-Muhumed, </em>388 F.3d at 818.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-6\">Uncorroborated but credible testimony alone from the applicant may be sufficient to sustain the burden of proof for asylum. 8 C.F.R.. \u00a7 208.13(a). \u201cConversely, an adverse credibility determination alone may be sufficient to support the denial of an asylum application.\u201d <em>Forgue v. United States Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1282, 1287 (11th Cir.2005). \u201cOnce an adverse credibility finding is made, the burden is on the applicant alien to show that the IJ\u2019s credibility decision was not supported by \u2018specific, cogent reasons\u2019 or was not based on substantial evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cOf course, an adverse credibility determination does not alleviate the IJ\u2019s duty to consider other evidence produced by an asylum applicant. That is, the IJ must still consider all evidence introduced by the applicant.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b225-7\">Indications of reliable testimony include consistency on direct examination, consistency with the written application, and the absence of embellishment as the applicant repeatedly recounts his story. <em>See In re B-, </em>21 I &amp; N Dec. 66, 70 (BIA 1995). The weaker the applicant\u2019s testimony, the greater the need for corroborative evidence. <em>See In re Y-B-, </em>21 I &amp; N Dec. 1136, 1139 (BIA 1998). Moreover, an adverse credibility finding must go to the \u201c \u2018heart of the asylum claim,\u2019 \u201d and not be based on minor discrepancies, inconsistencies, or omissions. <em>Gao v. Ashcroft, </em>299 F.3d 266, 272 (3d Cir.2002); <em>see also Pop v. INS, </em>270 F.3d 527, 531 (7th Cir.2001) (failure to list every incident of persecution should not result in credibility challenges). Additionally, if the IJ provides specific examples of vague, inconsistent, and implausible statements by the alien, and the alien does not provide corroborating evidence to bolster the weaknesses in his testimony, an adverse credibility finding is supported by substantial evidence. <em>See Chebchoub v. INS, </em>257 F.3d 1038, 1042-44 (9th Cir. 2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b225-9\">Hincapie\u2019s argument on appeal that the date on the passports should not be considered because she did not obtain them from the embassy is contradicted by her testimony that she obtained the passports legally in November 2000. This testimony was inconsistent with the evidence because her passport and Jhon\u2019s passport were issued on 5 July 1999, and Santiago\u2019s passport was issued on 1 August 2000. In addition to this inconsistency, the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility finding is supported by additional inconsistencies in Hincapie\u2019s testimony: (1) she stated that she did not intend to return to Colombia, but had purchased three round-trip tickets from Cali to Orlando; (2) she testified that she left Colombia because of threatening letters from the ELN, but she also testified that she came to Orlando to take her grandson to Disney World; (3) she stated that she had informed the Colombian military of the ELN guerillas\u2019 plans, but in her \u201ccredible-fear\u201d interview and asylum application she stated that she had not; and (4) she claimed in her \u201ccredible-fear\u201d interview, asylum application, and asylum hearing testimony that she operated a store, but told the immigration inspector that she did not work outside the home. Although Hincapi\u00e9 provided corroborating evidence to support her claims of receiving threats while working in the Kiosko\u2014the unsworn letters from customers and the owner of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>the Kiosko\u2014this evidence does not affect the other inconsistencies in her testimony, which go to the heart of her claim. <em>See Chebchoub, </em>257 F.3d at 1042-44; <em>Gao, </em>299 F.3d at 272. Thus, the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility finding was supported by \u201c \u2018specific, cogent reasons\u2019 \u201d\u2014Hincapie\u2019s testimony contained internal inconsistencies and was contradicted by the evidence\u2014and substantial evidence. <em>See Forgue, </em>401 F.3d at 1287; <em>D-Muhumed, </em>388 F.3d at 817-18. Moreover, consideration of the additional evidence presented by Hincapi\u00e9\u2014the unsworn letters\u2014do not compel a reasonable factfinder to conclude that a well-founded fear of future persecution exists, especially in light of the other record evidence contradicting Hincapie\u2019s asylum claim, such as the passport dates and round-trip tickets. <em>See Forgue, </em>401 F.3d at 1287; <em>Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. at 481 &amp; n. 1, 112 S.Ct. at 815 &amp; n. 1. Therefore, the IJ\u2019s denial of asylum was supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-4\">III. <em>CONCLUSION</em></p>\n<p id=\"b226-5\">Substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s finding that Hincapie\u2019s testimony was not credible because her testimony was materially inconsistent with her asylum application, her \u201ccredible-fear\u201d interview, and other evidence. Moreover, the IJ did not err in finding that the evidence failed to establish a well-founded fear of persecution, because Hincapie\u2019s additional evidence would not compel a reasonable factfinder to find that the requisite fear of persecution exists. Accordingly, the petition is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b222-7\">. Maria Hincapi\u00e9 is the primary applicant.
