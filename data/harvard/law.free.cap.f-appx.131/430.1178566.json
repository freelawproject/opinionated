Holloway\u2019s attorney has filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), asserting there are no meritorious legal issues but arguing the district court abused its discretion. Holloway has been informed of her right to file a pro se supplemental brief but has not done so.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-24\">We review a district court\u2019s judgment revoking a probation sentence for abuse of discretion. <em>Burns v. United States, </em>287 U.S. 216, 222, 53 S.Ct. 154, 77 L.Ed. 266 (1932). Upon finding a probation violation, the district court may revoke probation and resentence the defendant to any sentence within the statutory maximum for the original offense. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3565(a) (2000); <em>United States v. Schaefer, </em>120 F.3d 505, 507 (4th Cir.1997). Holloway\u2019s sentence fell within the guidelines range of 4-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>10 months and was clearly below the five year statutory maximum. Thus, we find the district court did not abuse its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-5\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the entire record in this case and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. We, therefore, affirm the district court\u2019s judgment. This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of her right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-6\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decision process.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-7\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
