HIGGINBOTHAM, Circuit Judge: <footnotemark>*</footnotemark></author>\n<p id=\"b472-20\">Ronald Wayne Abney challenges his sentence for transportation of an illegal alien. Although he plead guilty and admitted the facts underlying his sentence enhancement, he claims that his sentence was imposed in violation of <em>United States v. Booker.</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-21\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b472-22\">Ronald Wayne Abney plead guilty to one count of transportation of an illegal alien in violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1324. At his re-arraignment, Abney conceded that he had driven a tractor-trailer through Laredo, Texas, in August with seven illegal aliens in the back of the trailer. Based on this admission, the district court enhanced Abney\u2019s offense level by three on grounds that his conduct \u201cintentionally or recklessly creat[ed] a substantial risk of death or serious bodily injury to another person.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The court then sentenced him to eighteen <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>months\u2019 imprisonment to be followed by three years\u2019 supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-5\">We affirmed in an unpublished opinion. The Supreme Court denied Abney\u2019s petition for writ of certiorari, but after <em>Blakely v. Washington</em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark><em> </em>granted a timely motion for rehearing vacating our judgment and remanding for further consideration in light of <em>Booker.</em><footnotemark><em>4</em></footnotemark><em> We </em>ordered supplemental briefing.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b473-7\">The Government argues on remand that this appeal is moot as Abney was released from custody on December 12, 2003. Abney urges that an actual controversy still exists because he is subject to supervised release until December 12, 2006. Article III, \u00a7 2 of the Constitution requires that a \u201c \u2018case-or-controversy ... subsist[ ] through all stages of federal judicial proceedings, trial and appellate.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> We find that this requirement is met because Abney is still subject to supervised release, a part of his total sentence.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b473-18\">Turning to the merits, Abney concedes that he failed to raise a <em>Blakely </em>or <em>Booker-</em>type objection in the district court. Thus, our review is for plain error only. \u201cWe find plain error when: (1) there was an error; (2) the error was clear and obvious; and (3) the error affected the defendant\u2019s substantial rights.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> If all three conditions are met we have discretion to correct the error; however, we \u201cordinarily will <em>not </em>do so unless it affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b473-19\">Assuming that the first two prongs of the plain error test are satisfied here,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>Abney has failed to demonstrate that his substantial rights were affected. In <em>United States v. Mares, </em>we found that in order to satisfy the third prong of the plain error test, the proponent of the error must demonstrate that his sentence \u201cwould have likely been different had the judge been sentencing under the <em>Booker </em>advisory regime rather then the <em>pre-Booker </em>mandatory regime.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Abney points to the district court\u2019s decision to sentence him to eighteen months\u2019 imprisonment, at the bottom end of his guidelines range. The Government replies that the district court recognized its ability to depart below the guideline range, as Abney requested, but declined to do so. Absent additional evidence, we cannot say that the trial court would have imposed a different sentence had the Guidelines been advisory.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b472-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.

The Government argues that the trial court did not commit <em>Booker </em>error because Abney admitted all of the facts necessary to apply the endangerment enhancement. <em>See Booker, </em>125 S.Ct. at 756 (\"Any fact (other than a prior conviction) which is necessary to support a sentence exceeding the maximum authorized by the facts established by a plea of guilty or a juiy verdict must be <em>admitted </em>by the defendant or proved to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d); <em>United States v.

This argument raises the question of whether Abney admitted to his mens rea when he admitted that he transported aliens in a manner that may be considered dangerous. <em>See Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 493, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000) (\"The defendant's intent in committing a crime is perhaps as close as one might hope to come to a core criminal offense 'element.' \u201d).
