After a four-day jury trial, the district court granted Deputy Street\u2019s motion for judgment as a matter of law based on qualified immunity.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The district court also denied plaintiff Miller\u2019s motion for new trial. Miller, proceeding <em>pro se, </em>appeals both rulings.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-5\">We first note that Miller has failed to provide this Court with a complete trial transcript. Accordingly, we cannot review in a meaningful way whether any evidentiary errors were committed by the district court during the trial of this case, and \u201cwe must affirm the district court when an appellant fails to provide all the evidence that the trial court had before it when making various contested evidentiary rulings.\u201d <em>Loren v. Sasser, </em>309 F.3d 1296, 1304 (11th Cir.2002); <em>accord Borden, Inc. v. Florida East Coast Ry. Co., </em>772 F.2d 750, 758 (11th Cir.1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b190-6\">Alternatively, we affirm because based on the parts of the record that Miller did provide, Miller\u2019s arguments on appeal lack merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b190-9\">. Although the district court granted Deputy Street\u2019s motion for judgment as a matter of law, the district court, in an abundance of caution, also submitted certain issues to the jury. The jury answered these two jury interrogatories as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b190-10\">Do you find from a preponderance of the evidence: 1. That Deputy Street intentionally committed acts that violated George Miller's federal constitutional right not to be subjected to excessive or unreasonable force during the pursuit of Mr. Miller before he reached the vehicle operated by Russell Elwell?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b190-24\">The jury answered no.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b190-25\">Do you find from a preponderance of the evidence: 1. George Miller attempted to forcibly enter and take an occupied vehicle before Deputy Street discharged his firearm?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b190-26\">The jury answered yes.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
