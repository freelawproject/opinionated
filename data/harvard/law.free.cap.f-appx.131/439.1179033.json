Chimney admitted to possession of 53.7 grams of cocaine base. The PSR recommended a base offense level of 32, a two-level enhancement for Chimney\u2019s aggravating role in the offense as an organizer/leader, and a three-level reduction for timely acceptance of responsibility, producing in a total offense level of 31. The resulting guidelines imprisonment range, after accounting for the statutory mandatory minimum sentence of ten years, was 120-135 months. The district court imposed the maximum guidelines sentence of 135 months\u2019 imprisonment. We affirmed.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Supreme Court vacated our judgment and remanded to us for further consideration in light of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S.-, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b466-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>Chimney argues that his sentence should be vacated in light of <em>Booker </em>because the two-level enhancement was made on the basis of disputed facts under a mandatory guidelines system. Because Chimney did not raise a Booker-type objection in the district court, we review only for plain error.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> As we recently described in <em>United States v. Mares,</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b466-4\">[a]n appellate court may not correct an error the defendant failed to raise in the district court unless there is (1) error, (2) that is plain, and (3) that affects substantial rights. If all three conditions are met an appellate court may then exercise its discretion to notice a forfeited error but only if (4) the error seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b466-5\">In the present case, the third prong has not been met. Chimney has not carried his \u201cburden of demonstrating that the result would have likely been different had the judge been sentencing under the <em>Booker </em>advisory regime rather than the pre<em>Booker </em>mandatory regime.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b466-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b465-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
