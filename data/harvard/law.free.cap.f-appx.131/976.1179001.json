He argues pursuant to <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), and <em>United States v. Booker, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), that he had a Sixth Amendment right to have a jury resolve the disputed issue whether $148,000 seized by the Government was obtained as a result of the drug conspiracy.</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-7\">The Supreme Court held in <em>Libretti v. United States, </em>516 U.S. 29, 49, 116 S.Ct. 356, 133 L.Ed.2d 271 (1995), that \u201cthe right <em>to </em>a jury verdict on forfeitability [did] not fall within the Sixth Amendment\u2019s constitutional protection.\u201d <em>Libretti </em>has not been overruled by <em>Blakely </em>or <em>Booker. Libretti </em>therefore controls the constitutional issue \u201cunless and until the Supreme Court itself determines to overrule it.\u201d <em>Cf. United States v. Dabeit, </em>231 F.3d 979, 984 (5th Cir.2000) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Given that Washington did not have a Sixth Amendment right to a jury trial of the disputed forfeiture issue, the issue whether he orally waived that right is moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1002-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
