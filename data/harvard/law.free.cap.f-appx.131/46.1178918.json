Morrison pleaded guilty to possession with intent to distribute crack cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1), and possession of a firearm by a felon, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b72-23\">Morrison argues that a sentence enhancement for possession of a weapon constituted impermissible double counting in violation of Amendment 599. Morrison further contends that his sentence is unconstitutional under <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), and <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004). In light of <em>Blakely </em>and the Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), Morrison has filed a motion seeking the recall of this court\u2019s mandate affirming Morrison\u2019s direct criminal appeal (No. GO-51218). Morrison further requests that his case be remanded for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-27\">Amendment 599, which amended the commentary to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.4, applies <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>to convictions under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 844(h) and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 924(c) and 929(a). Morrison pleaded guilty to violating 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1), and his guideline sentencing range was computed under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1, based upon his drug conviction. Accordingly, Amendment 599 does not apply to Morrison\u2019s sentence. Morrison\u2019s <em>Apprendi, Blakely, </em>and <em>Booker </em>arguments are not cognizable in the context of a 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion. <em>See United States v. Shaw, </em>30 F.3d 26, 29 (5th Cir. 1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b73-5\">AFFIRMED; MOTION TO RECALL MANDATE DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b72-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
