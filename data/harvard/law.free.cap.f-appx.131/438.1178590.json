The district court sentenced Appellant to 87 months of imprisonment and five years of supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-18\">In his guilty plea, Appellant waived \u201cthe right to appeal [the] sentence on any ground\u201d on direct appeal and in any post conviction proceeding, including a motion under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. Appellant, however, reserved the right to appeal \u201cany punishment imposed in excess of the statutory maximum\u201d (40 years) and \u201cany punishment to the extent it constitutes an upward departure from the Guideline range deemed most applicable by the sentencing court.\u201d \u201e</p>\n<p id=\"b464-23\">Appellant asserts the appeal waiver does not preclude this appeal because the sentence was based on judicial findings of fact neither admitted by Appellant nor found by a jury. Appellant contends the sentence, therefore, exceeds the statutory maximum as defined in <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, -, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 2537, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004)(statuto-ry maximum is the \u201cmaximum sentence a judge may impose <em>solely on the basis of the facts reflected in the jury verdict or admitted by the defendant\u201d </em>(emphasis in original)).</p>\n<p id=\"b464-25\">Given our court\u2019s very recent holding in <em>United States v. McKinney, </em>406 F.3d 744, ---(5th Cir.2005), that neither <em>Blakely </em>nor <em>United States v. Booker, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), changes the meaning of \u201cguidelines range\u201d for a guilty-plea appeal-waiver, we doubt Appellant\u2019s contention that these cases change the definition of \u201cstatutory maximum\u201d is meritorious. Even if this appeal is not precluded by Appellant\u2019s appeal-waiver, the claims raised fail plain error review.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-28\">Relying on <em>Blakely, </em>Appellant asserts for the first time on appeal that the district court made findings at sentencing on drug quantity and on his role in the offense in violation of the Sixth Amendment. Appellant contends the use of these findings to increase his sentence was reversible plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>To demonstrate plain error, Appellant must show an error is obvious and affects his substantial rights. <em>See United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 521-522 (5th Cir. 2005). To show the error affected his substantial rights, Appellant must demonstrate that \u201cthe sentencing judge\u2014sentencing under an advisory scheme rather than a mandatory one\u2014would have reached a significantly different result\u201d. <em>Id. </em>at 522. Appellant has not demonstrated the district court would have imposed a different sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b464-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
