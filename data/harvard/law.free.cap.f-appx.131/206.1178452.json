Patillo contends that the district court erred in (1) not granting her a two-level adjustment to reflect her minor role in the scheme, pursuant to U.S.S.G. 3B1.2; and (2) determining her guideline sentence based on facts that neither were charged in her indictment nor found beyond a reasonable doubt, in the light of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004). No reversible error has been shown; we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-22\">Patillo\u2019s presentence investigation report (\u201cPSI\u201d) recommended that her offenses be grouped together, pursuant to U.S.S.G. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>\u00a7 3D1.2(d), and that her base offense level be set at 6, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7\u00a7 2B1.1(a)(2) (guideline for offenses involving fraud).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The PSI also recommended a 14-level increase because the offense involved approximately $494,095 in losses, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(l)(H) (guideline for loss amounts greater than $400,000); a 2-level increase because the offense involved fraudulent conduct during a bankruptcy proceeding, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(7)(B); a 2-level increase because the offense involved sophisticated means, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(8)(C); a 2-level increase because the offense involved the unauthorized transfer or use of any means of identification, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(9)(C)(i); and a 2-level downward adjustment for acceptance of responsibility, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3El.l(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b234-6\">Patillo objected to the PSI\u2019s recommended guideline enhancements, but she did not argue that a jury\u2014instead of the district court\u2014should decide them. Patillo also objected to the PSI\u2019s failure to recommend a minor-role adjustment, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2(b), because (1) her role in the mortgage-fraud scheme was minor compared with its other participants, (2) she was not aware fully of the scope of the scheme, (3) she was not involved in its planning, and (4) she did not default on either of the loans she entered as part of this scheme.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-7\">After conducting an evidentiary hearing on Patillo\u2019s objections, the district court overruled them, except for the \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(7)(B) adjustment for bankruptcy fraud. The court also overruled Patillo\u2019s objection to the PSI\u2019s failure to recommend a minor-role adjustment, based on its summary determination that this adjustment was not supported by evidence in the record. The court, however, sentenced Patillo at the low end of her guideline range \u201cin deference to the fact that [Patillo\u2019s] involvement was less than some of the [other participants].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b234-11\">I. <em>Minor Role Adjustment</em></p>\n<p id=\"b234-12\">Patillo argues on appeal that the district court erred as a matter of law by refusing to grant her a minor-role adjustment after the court concluded that she was less culpable than other participants. Section 3B 1.2(b) of the Sentencing Guidelines provides for a two-level adjustment in a defendant\u2019s base offense level if she was a minor participant in the offense. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2(b). A district court\u2019s determination of a defendant\u2019s role in an offense constitutes a factual finding reviewed for clear error. <em>United States v. De Varon, </em>175 F.3d 930, 937 (11th Cir. 1999) <em>(en banc). </em>The defendant bears the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that she is entitled to a minor-role adjustment. <em>Id. </em>at 939.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-13\">A minor participant in an offense means a participant \u201c[w]ho is less culpable than most other participants, but whose role could not be described as minimal.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2., comment, (n.5). To determine whether a defendant played a minor role in the offense for which she has been held accountable, the district court must \u201cmeasure the defendant\u2019s role against the relevant conduct attributable to her in calculating.her base offense level.\u201d <em>De Var\u00f3n, </em>175 F.3d at 944. Where the relevant conduct attributable to a defendant \u201cis identical to her actual conduct, she cannot prove that she is entitled to a minor-role adjustment simply by pointing to some broader criminal scheme in which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>she was a minor participant but for which she was not accountable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 941.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Although in many cases this first method of analysis will be dispositive, the court also may measure the defendant\u2019s culpability in comparison to that of other participants in the relevant conduct. <em>Id. </em>at 944-45.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-5\">The district court held Patillo accountable for the total loss amount from real-estate transactions in which she either misrepresented her financial status, falsified identification documents for \u201cstraw purchasers,\u201d or helped recruit buyers. Shawn Wilson testified at sentencing that, although another defendant recruited him, he primarily dealt with Patillo when he provided false identification information. Indeed, although the court\u2014in sentencing Patillo at the low end of her guideline range\u2014stated that it had determined that she was less involved in the mortgage-fraud scheme than some of her codefendants, we have explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b235-6\">a defendant is not automatically entitled to a minor role adjustment merely because she was somewhat less culpable than the other discernable participants. Rather, the district court must determine that the defendant was less culpable than <em>most other participants </em>in her relevant conduct.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b235-9\"><em>See De Varon, </em>175 F.3d at 944 (emphasis in original). Because Patillo failed to establish by a preponderance of the evidence that she was less culpable than most other participants, the court did not clearly err in denying her request for a minor-role adjustment.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b235-10\">II. <em>Blakely/Booker Error</em></p>\n<p id=\"b235-11\">Patillo also asserts that the district court violated her Sixth Amendment rights under <em>Blakely </em>by determining her guideline sentence based on facts that neither were charged in her indictment nor proven to a jury. Because Patillo failed to raise this constitutional claim in the district court, we review it only for plain error. <em>See United States v. Rodriguez, </em>398 F.3d 1291, 1298 (11th Cir.2005) (applying plain error review to <em>Blakely </em>claim that appellant failed to raise in the district court). Under plain error review, an appellate court may not correct an error the defendant failed to raise in the district court unless there is \u201c(1) error, (2) that is plain, and (3) that affects substantial rights.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotations and internal marks omitted). \u201cIf all three conditions are met, an appellate court may then exercise its discretion to notice a forfeited error, but only if (4) the error seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>cial proceedings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b236-4\">The Supreme Court determined in <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), that \u201c[o]ther than the fact of a prior conviction, any fact that increases the penalty beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury, and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2362-63. After the district court sentenced Patillo, the Supreme Court concluded in <em>Blakely </em>that the imposition\u2014-based solely on the sentencing judge\u2019s factual findings\u2014of a sentencing enhancement above the 53-month standard range indicated in the State of Washington\u2019s Sentencing Reform Act violated the defendant\u2019s Sixth Amendment rights because the facts supporting the findings neither were admitted by the defendant, nor found by a jury. <em>Blakely, </em>124 S.Ct. at 2534-38. The Court in <em>Blakely, </em>however, expressly stated that \u201c[t]he Federal Guidelines are not before us, and we express no opinion on them.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2538 n. 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-5\">The Supreme Court in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>-U.S.-, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), however, recently determined that \u201cno distinction of constitutional significance [existed] between the Federal Sentencing Guidelines and the Washington procedures at issue [in <em>Blake</em>ly].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 749. The Court, therefore, concluded that the mandatory nature of the guidelines rendered them incompatible with the Sixth Amendment\u2019s guarantee to the right to a jury trial. <em>Id. </em>at 749-51. The Court also reaffirmed its rationale in <em>Apprendi </em>that \u201c[a]ny fact (other than a prior conviction) which is necessary to support a sentence exceeding the maximum authorized by the facts established by a plea of guilty or a jury verdict must be admitted by the defendant or proved to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 756.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-9\">In <em>Rodriguez, </em>we reviewed a similar appeal in which the appellant had failed to preserve a <em>Blakely/Booker </em>objection in the district court, and the Supreme Court had decided <em>Booker </em>while the appellant\u2019s sentence was pending on direct appeal. Applying plain error review, we determined that the appellant had satisfied the first element of plain error by showing error because, under a mandatory guideline system, the appellant\u2019s sentence had been enhanced based on judicially determined factual findings that went beyond the facts admitted by the defendant or found by the jury. <em>Rodriguez, </em>398 F.3d at 1298.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-10\">We also determined in <em>Rodriguez </em>that the second element of plain-error review had been met. <em>Id. </em>at 1299. We explained that, although the <em>Booker </em>error had not been \u201cplain\u201d when the court had sentenced the appellant, \u201cwhere the law at the time of trial was settled and clearly contrary to the law at the time of appeal\u2014it is enough that the error be \u2018plain\u2019 at the time of appellate consideration.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted); <em>see also Booker, </em>125 S.Ct. at 769 (directing that decision was applicable to all cases on direct appeal).</p>\n<p id=\"b236-11\">But we concluded in <em>Rodriguez </em>that no plain error had occurred because, under the third element of plain error, the appellant had failed to show that the <em>Booker </em>error \u201caffect[ed] substantial rights,\u201d that is, that the error \u201cmust have affected the outcome of the district court proceedings.\u201d <em>Rodriguez, </em>398 F.3d at 1299, 1306 (quotation omitted). We discussed that the test for showing that the error \u201caffected the outcome of the district court proceedings\u201d was the formulation of a reasonable probability of a different result, which means a probability \u201csufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1299 (quotation omitted). We also reiterated that, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>under this third element, \u201c[i]t is the defendant rather than the [government who bears the burden of persuasion with respect to prejudice.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Because we determined that the record in <em>Rodriguez </em>\u201cprovide[d] no reason to believe any result [was] more likely than not,\u201d we concluded that the appellant had not met his burden on the third element of plain-error review. <em>Id. </em>at 1301. And we concluded that we \u201cha[d] no occasion to decide how he would have fared under the fourth [element].\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b237-5\">In the instant case, Patillo contested the facts on which the court relied in calculating her guideline sentence under a mandatory guidelines system. We conclude that <em>Booker </em>error occurred and that it is now \u201cplain.\u201d <em>See Rodriguez, </em>398 F.3d at 1298-99.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> But similar to the facts in <em>Rodriguez, </em>Patillo has not explained on appeal, much less proven under the third element of plain-error review, how her substantial rights were affected by the court\u2019s <em>Booker </em>error.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-9\">Indeed, district courts still must consider guideline ranges. <em>See Booker, </em>125 S.Ct. at 764 (\u2018Without the \u2018mandatory\u2019 provision, the [Sentencing Reform Act] nonetheless requires judges to take account of the Guidelines together with other sentencing goals\u201d). Because the court heard extensive testimony on Patillo\u2019s offense conduct, the court, at least implicitly, considered the nature and circumstances of the offense and Patillo\u2019s character. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(1).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In imposing a sentence at the low end of Patillo\u2019s guideline range, based on its determination that she played a lesser role than some of the participants, the court also demonstrated that it considered the need for the sentence imposed. <em>See </em>18 U.S.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2)-(4). And the court ordered a restitution amount that reflected the loss sustained by the victims of the fraud. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(7).</p>\n<p id=\"b237-10\">Even in the absence of these determinations, the likelihood of a different result would be speculative without a clear statement or sign from the court that, but for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>the fact that its discretion was constrained under the federal guidelines, it would have imposed a lighter sentence. <em>See Rodriguez, </em>398 F.3d at 1300-01. Patillo has not cited to such evidence. At best, it is unclear whether the court would have imposed a different sentence. Patillo, therefore, has not met her burden of showing a reasonable probability that the result of her sentencing would have been different but for the <em>Booker </em>error, and we need not determine the fourth element of plain-error review. <em>See id. </em>at 1301.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-4\">In sum, the district court erred under <em>Booker </em>and this error was \u201cplain.\u201d We, however, conclude that we may not exercise our discretion to notice this forfeited error because Patillo has failed to carry, her burden under the third element of plain error to show that this <em>pre-Booker </em>error affected her substantial rights. We, therefore, affirm Patillo\u2019s \u2022 41-month sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b234-8\">. To avoid <em>ex post facto </em>issues, the PSI used the 2001 edition of the United States Sentencing Guidelines in calculating Patillo\u2019s guideline sentence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b235-7\">. Amendment 635 of the Sentencing Guidelines, which revised the commentary to \u00a7 3B1.2., states that a defendant \"who is accountable under \u00a7 IB 1.3 (Relevant Conduct) only for the conduct in which the defendant personally was involved and who performs a limited function in concerted criminal activity is not precluded from consideration for an adjustment under this guideline.\u201d <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2, comment. (n.3(A)). Patillo implies that this amendment constituted a change in our law. But we have determined that the Sentencing Commission, through Amendment 635, ratified our approach in <em>De Var\u00f3n. See United States v. Boyd, </em>291 F.3d 1274, 1277 (11th Cir.2002).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b235-12\">. To the extent that the district court summarily denied Patillo\u2019s request for a minor-role adjustment, we have determined that, \"[i]n making the ultimate determination of the defendant\u2019s role in the offense, the sentencing judge has no duty to make any specific subsidiary factual findings.... So long an the district court\u2019s decision is supported by the record and the court clearly resolves any <em>disputed </em>factual issues, a simple statement of the district court\u2019s conclusion is sufficient.\u201d <em>See De Varon, </em>175 F.3d at 939 (internal citations omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b237-6\">. We explained in further detail in <em>Rodriguez </em>that <em>\"pre-Booker </em>defendants must establish a reasonable probability that if the district court had considered the guidelines range it arrived at using extra-verdict enhancements as merely advisory, instead of mandatory, and had taken into account any otherwise unconsidered [18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)] factors, the court would have imposed a lesser sentence than it did.\u201d <em>See Rodriguez, </em>398 F.3d at 1302.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b237-7\">. In determining that <em>Booker </em>error occurred in <em>Rodriguez, </em>we noted, without deciding, that an enhancement for obstruction of justice may not have been a <em>Booker </em>error \"because the jury verdict convicting the appellant of the crimes he denied necessarily, albeit implicitly, found that he had engaged in behavior that frt[] within \u00a7 3C1.1.\" <em>See Rodriguez, </em>398 F.3d at 1298 n. 5. In the instant case, however, Patillo contested during her plea colloquy and at sentencing the facts underlying her sentence enhancements.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b237-8\">. These other relevant factors in \u00a7 3553(a) include: \"(1) the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant; (2) the need for the sentence imposed\u2014(A) to reflect the seriousness of the offense, to promote respect for the law, and to provide just punishment for the offense; (B) to afford adequate deterrence to criminal conduct; (C) to protect the public from further crimes of the defendant; and (D) to provide the defendant with needed educational or vocational training, medical care, or other correctional treatment in the most effective manner; (3) the kinds of sentences available; (4) the kinds of sentence and the sentencing range established for ... (A) the applicable category of offense committed by the applicable category of defendant as set forth in the guidelines ...; (5) any pertinent policy statement []; (6) the need to avoid unwarranted sentence disparities among defendants with similar records who have been found guilty of similar conduct; and (7) the need to provide restitution to any victims of the offense.\u201d <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(l)-(7).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
