The district court sentenced Lundin to three concurrent sentences of 324 months\u2019 imprisonment and 5 years of supervised release. Lundin appealed, raising challenges to his convictions and sentences, including a challenge based on <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). On October 4, 2001, this Court affirmed Lundin\u2019s convictions and sentences. <em>United States v. Kirk, </em>275 F.3d 51 (11th Cir.2001) (Table). The Supreme Court denied certiorari. <em>Lundin v. United States, </em>535 U.S. 1098, 122 S.Ct. 2298, 152 L.Ed.2d 1055 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b704-15\">On September 26, 2002, Lundin filed the instant \u00a7 2255 motion. Lundin raised twenty-three grounds for relief, including a claim that his sentences violated <em>Apprendi. </em>On December 30, 2003, the magistrate judge issued a report recommending that the district court deny Lundin\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion and on January 26, 2004, the district court adopted the magistrate judge\u2019s report in its entirety and denied Lundin\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion. Lundin filed a motion in the district court for a COA, which the district court also denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-16\">On June 24, 2004, after the district court denied Lundin\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion and motion for a COA, the Supreme Court decided <em>Blakely. Blakely </em>extended the rule in <em>Apprendi </em>and concluded that \u201cthe \u2018statutory maximum\u2019 for <em>Apprendi </em>purposes is the maximum sentence a judge may impose <em>solely on the basis of the facts reflected in the jury verdict or admitted by the defendant. </em>\u201d <em>Blakely, </em>124 S.Ct. at 2537 (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b704-17\">This Court initially denied Lundin\u2019s application for a COA. On August 12, 2004, however, this Court reconsidered its denial and granted Lundin\u2019s motion for a COA on the following issue: \u201cWhether appellant is entitled to relief in light of the Supreme Court\u2019s opinion in <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"679\">*679</page-number>\u2014 U.S.-, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004).\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b705-6\">On appeal, Lundin argues that the district court improperly determined drug quantity in his case and enhanced his sentence beyond the relevant statutory maximum in violation of <em>Blakely.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b705-7\">When reviewing the denial of a \u00a7 2255 motion, this Court \u201creview[s] questions of law de novo and findings of fact for clear error.\u201d <em>Varela v. United States, </em>400 F.3d 864, 867 n. 3 (11th Cir.2005). In <em>Varela, </em>this Court held that <em>\u201cBooker\u2019s </em>[and <em>Blakely\u2019s] </em>constitutional rule falls squarely under the category of new rules of criminal procedure that do not apply retroactively to \u00a7 2255 cases on collateral review.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 868. Accordingly, we affirm the denial of Lundin\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b704-12\">. Because Lundin filed his motion after the effective date of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (\"AEDPA\u201d), Pub.L. No. 104-132, 110 Stat. 1214 (1996), the provisions of that act apply.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b705-18\">. After we issued Lundin a COA, the Supreme Court further explained that the holding in <em>Blakely </em>applies to the Federal Sentencing Guidelines. <em>United States v. </em>Booker,-U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). To the extent Lundin's appeal turns on the application of <em>Blakely, </em>it also turns on the application of <em>Booker.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
