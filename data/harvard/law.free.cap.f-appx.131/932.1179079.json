Wiggins\u2019 attorney has filed a brief in accordance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"933\">*933</page-number>with <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), addressing whether there are any meritorious issues for appeal. Although informed of his right to file a pro se supplemental brief, Wiggins has not done so.</p>\n<p id=\"b959-5\">We review the district court\u2019s decision to revoke a defendant\u2019s supervised release for an abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Davis, </em>53 F.3d 638, 642-43 (4th Cir. 1995). The district court need only find a violation of a condition of supervised release by a preponderance of the evidence. 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3583(e)(3) (West 2000 &amp; Supp.2004). Moreover, because Wiggins\u2019 sentence does not exceed the statutory maximum under \u00a7 3583(e)(3), we review the sentence only to determine whether it is \u201cplainly unreasonable.\u201d See 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(a)(4) (2000). Our review of the record discloses no abuse of discretion, and we find that Wiggins\u2019 sentence is not plainly unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b959-6\">Counsel\u2019s brief addresses whether the district court abused its discretion in imposing a sentence which exceeded the guideline range in the Chapter 7 policy statements. However, the sentencing guideline range calculated under <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 7B 1.4(a) (2003) is purely advisory. <em>Davis, </em>53 F.3d at 642; <em>United States v. Denard, </em>24 F.3d 599, 602 (4th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b959-7\">In accordance with the requirements of <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the entire record in this case and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. Accordingly, we affirm. This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b959-9\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
