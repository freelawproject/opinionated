Teal, a former United States Postal Service (USPS) employee, appeals a district court order granting defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss for failure to exhaust her administrative remedies and a district court order granting defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss for failure to timely file suit in her employment discrimination and retaliation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>actions under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended, and the Age Discrimination in Employment Act. We find the district court correctly dismissed No. 05-1315 on the ground that Teal faded to file suit within ninety days of receipt of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission\u2019s (EEOC) right-to-sue letter. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-16(c) (2000). We also find the district court correctly dismissed No. 05-1316 on the ground that Teal failed to timely exhaust her administrative remedies by failing to file an appeal to the EEOC of the USPS\u2019s decision within thirty days. <em>See </em>29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1614.402(a). Accordingly, we affirm both orders for the reasons stated by the district court. <em>See Teal v. Singleton, </em>No. CA-03-603 (W.D.N.C. Feb. 1, 2005); <em>Teal v. Potter, </em>No. CA-03-604 (W.D.N.C. Jan. 31, 2005). We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid in the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-4\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
