Krischer on Mi-gut\u2019s claim for a declaratory judgment. Migut sought a declaratory judgment that tape-recording a police officer during a traffic stop does not violate Fla. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 934.03, which prohibits the intentional interception of certain communications. After review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-9\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b289-10\">Migut is a tow truck operator and is employed by a company specializing in removing illegally parked cars from private property.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On September 10, 2002, Deputy Sheriff Flynn stopped Migut for disobeying a stop sign. During the stop, Migut began to record his conversation with Deputy Sheriff Flynn with a handheld tape recorder. Upon noticing the recorder, Deputy Sheriff Flynn told Migut to turn the recorder off. Migut refused and Deputy Sheriff Flynn placed Migut under arrest for intercepting an oral communication in violation of Fla. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 934.03.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b289-14\">Subsequently, State Attorney Barry E. Krischer charged Migut with violation of \u00a7 934.03(l)(a). On December 18, 2002, the charge was dismissed by an entry of nolle prosse, which stated \u201c[ajlthough there was probable cause for arrest and charge of the Defendant, the State has entered a Nolle Prosse in this case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b289-15\">Migut brought suit against Deputy Sheriff Flynn and State Attorney Krischer. Migut\u2019s first amended complaint sued Deputy Sheriff Flynn for false arrest under \u00a7 1983 (count 1), and Deputy Sheriff Flynn and State Attorney Krischer for a declaratory judgment that \u00a7 934.03 is not violated when a motorist records a conversation with a police officer during a routine traffic stop (count 2).</p>\n<p id=\"b289-16\">Deputy Sheriff Flynn filed a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss Migut\u2019s \u00a7 1983 false-arrest claim based on qualified immunity. On May 13, 2004, the district court granted Deputy Sheriff Flynn\u2019s motion to dismiss, concluding that Migut\u2019s arrest was supported by arguable probable cause and that Deputy Sheriff Flynn was thus entitled to qualified immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-17\">Migut then moved for summary judgment on count 2, his claim for a declaratory judgment. The district court denied Migut\u2019s summary judgment motion and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>granted <em>sua sponte </em>summary judgment to Deputy Sheriff Flynn and State Attorney Krischer on count 2. Migut now appeals the final judgment entered on both counts 1 and 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-4\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"A_4\">A. Qualified Immunity Principles</p>\n<p id=\"b290-5\">\u201cThe defense of qualified immunity completely protects government officials performing discretionary functions from suit in their individual capacities unless their conduct violates clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known.\u201d <em>Cottone v. Jenne, </em>326 F.3d 1352, 1357 (11th Cir.2003) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). \u201cTo receive qualified immunity, a government official first must prove that he was acting within his discretionary authority.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1357-58 (citation omitted). In this case, it is clear\u2014and undisputed\u2014that Deputy Sheriff Flynn was acting within his discretionary authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-6\">\u201cOnce a defendant establishes that he was acting within his discretionary authority, the burden shifts to the plaintiff to show that the defendant is not entitled to qualified immunity.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1358. The Supreme Court has established a two-part test to determine the applicability of qualified immunity. \u201cThe threshold inquiry a court must undertake in a qualified immunity analysis is whether [the] plaintiffs allegations, if true, establish a constitutional violation.\u201d <em>Hope v. Pelzer, </em>536 U.S. 730, 736, 122 S.Ct. 2508, 2513, 153 L.Ed.2d 666 (2002) (citation omitted). \u201cIf, under the plaintiffs allegations, the defendants would have violated a constitutional right, \u2018the next, sequential step is to ask whether the right was clearly established.\u2019 \u201d <em>Cottone, </em>326 F.3d at 1358 (quoting <em>Saucier v. Katz, </em>533 U.S. 194, 201, 121 S.Ct. 2151, 150 L.Ed.2d 272 (2001)).</p>\n<p id=\"b290-9\">B. Migut\u2019s False-Arrest Claim</p>\n<p id=\"b290-10\">\u201cA warrantless arrest is constitutionally valid only when there is probable cause to arrest.\u201d <em>Holmes v. Kucynda, </em>321 F.3d 1069, 1079 (11th Cir.2003). Probable cause existed if, \u201cat the moment the arrest was made, \u2018the facts and circumstances within [the officers\u2019] knowledge and of which they had reasonably trustworthy information were sufficient to warrant a prudent man in believing\u2019 that [the suspect] had committed or was committing an offense.\u201d <em>Dahl v. Holley, </em>312 F.3d 1228, 1233 (11th Cir. 2002) (quoting <em>Hunter v. Bryant, </em>502 U.S. 224, 228, 112 S.Ct. 534, 537, 116 L.Ed.2d 589 (1991)). However, \u201c[t]o receive qualified immunity protection, an officer need not have actual probable cause but only <em>arguable probable cause.\u201d Holmes, </em>321 F.3d at 1079 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). To determine whether an officer has arguable probable cause, the inquiry is \u201cwhether an officer reasonably could have believed that probable cause existed, in light of the information the officer possessed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation marks and citation omitted). Thus, \u201c[e]ven law enforcement officials who \u2018reasonably but mistakenly conclude that probable cause is present\u2019 are entitled to immunity.\u201d <em>Hunter, </em>502 U.S. at 227, 112 S.Ct. at 536 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b290-11\">As discussed above, Deputy Sheriff Flynn, after noticing that Migut was taping their conversation and asking Migut to stop doing so, placed Migut under arrest for intercepting an oral communication in violation of Fla. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 934.03(l)(a).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b290-12\">Section 934.03 provides in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b291-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>(1) Except as otherwise specifically provided in this chapter, any person who:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b291-5\">(a) Intentionally intercepts, [or] endeavors to intercept ... any wire, oral, or electronic communication; ... shall be punished as provided in subsection (4).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b291-6\">Fla. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 934.03(l)(a). Subsection (4) provides that it is a third degree felony to intercept a wire, oral, or electronic communication. Fla. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 934.03(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b291-7\">Section 934.02(3) defines \u201cintercept\u201d as \u201cthe aural or other acquisition of the contents of <em>any </em>wire, electronic, or <em>oral communication </em>through the use of any electronic, mechanical, or other device.\u201d Fla. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 934.02(3) (emphasis added). Considering this definition of intercept, the Florida Supreme Court has determined that \u00a7 943.03 prohibits the tape recording of a face-to-face conversation in which one is participating without the consent of all parties. <em>See State v. Tsavaris, </em>394 So.2d 418, 420 (Fla.1981), <em>receded from on other grounds, </em>478 So.2d 38 (1985); <em>see also Guilder v. State, </em>899 So.2d 412, 417, 2005 WL 714859, *3-*4 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App. March 30, 2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b291-8\">Section 934.02(2) defines \u201coral communication\u201d as</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b291-9\">any oral communication uttered by a person <em>exhibiting an expectation that such communication is not subject to interception under circumstances justifying such expectation </em>and does not mean any public oral communication uttered at a public meeting or any electronic communication.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b291-10\">Fla. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 934.02(2) (emphasis added).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> For an oral conversation to be protected under \u00a7 934.03(l)(a), Florida courts have indicated that the speaker must have an actual subjective expectation of privacy, along with a societal recognition that the expectation is reasonable. <em>State v. Inciarrano, </em>473 So.2d 1272, 1275 (Fla.1985). \u201cWhere both elements are present, the statute has been violated whether the intercepted communication is private in nature or not.\u201d <em>Stevenson v. State, </em>667 So.2d 410, 412 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App.1996) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b291-13\">\u201cA significant factor used in determining the reasonableness of the defendant\u2019s expectation of privacy in a conversation is the location in which the conversation or communication occurs.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201c \u2018Conversations occurring inside an enclosed area or in a secluded area are more likely to be protected under section 934.02(2).\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Cinci v. State, </em>642 So.2d 572, 573 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App.1994). However, under Florida law, public places are not necessarily excluded from the statute, except when the public place is a public meeting. <em>See Brandin v. State, </em>669 So.2d 280, 281 (Fla. Dist.Ct.App.1996) (\u201cWe cannot agree with the state\u2019s assertion that conversations occurring in public areas can <em>never </em>be made with an expectation of privacy. Common experience teaches that the opposite may often be true.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b291-14\">Besides location, \u201c[o]ther significant factors used in determining the reasonableness of the defendant\u2019s expectation of privacy are the manner in which the oral communication is made and the kind of communication.\u201d <em>Stevenson, </em>667 So.2d at 412.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>This Court has been unable to locate a case in which a Florida court has specifically held that police officers have a reasonable expectation of privacy in their conversations with citizens.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> However, one Florida court has concluded that an officer had probable cause to believe a violation of \u00a7 934.03(l)(a) occurred when the suspect had recorded a conversation with another officer without that officer\u2019s consent. <em>State v. Keen, </em>384 So.2d 284 (Fla.Dist.Ct. App.1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b292-4\">In <em>Keen, </em>the defendant Keen visited the jail seeking to have a bugging device (that was seized earlier in the day) returned to him. Officer Frawley, who had noticed Keen at the jail earlier, engaged Keen in conversation about his bugging device. During the conversation, Keen took out a small tape recorder and held it in the palm of his hand. At the conclusion of the conversation, Keen put the tape recorder back in his pocket. <em>Id. </em>at 285. Officer Frawley contacted Sergeant Deludes in the Sheriffs Office to tell him to- stop Keen\u2019s car if he saw it and seize the small tape recorder because Keen had recorded Frawley without Frawley\u2019s consent. <em>Id. </em>at 286. Officer Deludes subsequently stopped Keen\u2019s vehicle and seized the recorder. The issue in <em>Keen </em>was whether there was sufficient probable cause to stop Keen\u2019s car, thus validating the seizure of the tape recorder. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b292-7\">The <em>Keen </em>court concluded that Deludes \u2019had a \u201crational basis for formulating a probable belief that a violation of Section 934.03(l)(a) had occurred\u201d and thus, there was probable cause for the stop. In doing so, the Florida court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-8\">It is obvious from the record that Frawley [the officer at the jail] had good reason to believe that the appellee was probably bugging him, especially when we consider that he had prior knowledge that the appellee was carrying the bugging device.... The evidence indicates that Frawley had a rational basis for formulating a probable belief that a violation of Section 934.03(l)(a) had occurred. The cumulative effect of the information and observations known to Frawley, combined with his expertise, knowledge, and skill as a police officer, were sufficient to give him reasonable grounds for believing that the appellee was engaged in the commission of a crime.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b292-9\"><em>Keen, </em>384 So.2d at 287. Thus, the Florida court determined that there was probable cause to believe that Keen\u2019s tape recording of Officer Frawley was a violation of \u00a7 934.03(l)(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b292-10\">The issue in this case is whether, considering the facts as set forth in the complaint, Deputy Flynn had at least arguable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>probable cause to believe that Migut was violating \u00a7 934.0S(l)(a) when Migut taped their conversation. We conclude that he did. There is no dispute that Migut intentionally intercepted via tape recorder his conversation with Deputy Sheriff Flynn, and that Deputy Sheriff Flynn did not consent. Moreover, it was not unreasonable for Deputy Sheriff Flynn to expect that the conversation would be protected under \u00a7 934.03(l)(a). <em>See Keen, </em>384 So.2d at 287.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-5\">Accordingly, Deputy Sheriff Flynn did not violate Migut\u2019s constitutional rights, and the district court properly dismissed the false-arrest claim against Flynn based on qualified immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-6\">C. Migut\u2019s Declaratory Judgment Claim</p>\n<p id=\"b293-7\">Migut also appeals the district court\u2019s order denying Migut\u2019s summary judgment motion and granting <em>sua sponte </em>summary judgment to Deputy Sheriff Flynn and State Attorney Krischer on Migut\u2019s claim for declaratory relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-8\">In the district court, Migut sought a declaratory judgment stating that \u201con the public street, or in any other public place, Florida Statute \u00a7 934.03 does not afford an officer of the law a legal right not to have his conversations with a citizen recorded while conducting an investigatory traffic stop.\u201d The district court denied declaratory relief, stating that \u201c[i]f the [Florida] legislature had intended that citizens could be allowed to tape record police officers\u2019 conversations, they could have said so.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b293-9\">We conclude that the district court properly denied Migut\u2019s request for declaratory relief. First, \u00a7 934.03 is unambiguous and does not include an exception for a private individual who records a police officer without the officer\u2019s consent. <em>See </em>\u00a7 934.03 (prohibiting some interception conduct and allowing other interception conduct). Second, Migut points to no United States Supreme Court, Eleventh Circuit, or Florida state court decision holding that the communications of police officers conducting traffic stops are not protected by \u00a7 934.03. Indeed, the only Florida decision addressing this issue actually concluded that it was reasonable for the police officer to believe a violation of \u00a7 934.03(l)(a) occurred when the suspect had recorded a conversation with another officer without that officer\u2019s consent. <em>See Keen, 384 </em>So.2d at 287.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-11\">Third, communications in public places are not necessarily excluded from \u00a7 934.03 (except when the public place is a public meeting). <em>See Brandin, </em>669 So.2d at 281 (\u2018We cannot agree with the state\u2019s assertion that conversations occurring in public areas can <em>never </em>be made with an expectation of privacy. Common experience teaches that the opposite may often be true.\u201d). Thus, just because a traffic stop takes place on a public street does not mean that the police officer\u2019s communication is not protected under \u00a7 934.03. Fourth, the communication does not have to be private to be protected. <em>See Stevenson, </em>667 So.2d at 412 (\u201cWhere both elements are present, [\u00a7 934.03] has been violated whether the intercepted communication is private in nature or not.\u201d). Thus, the fact that the police officer\u2019s communication occurred during a traffic stop on a public street does not necessarily mean that it is not protected under \u00a7 934.03.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-12\">Finally, whether a particular communication is protected under \u00a7 934.03(l)(a) is an intensely fact-specific inquiry, and we are not prepared to hold that the Florida legislature intended to exclude from the protections of \u00a7 934.03 all citizen communications with all police officers during all traffic stops on a public street.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b294-4\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal of Migut\u2019s \u00a7 1983 false-arrest claim. We also affirm the district court\u2019s denial of summary judgment to Migut and grant of summary judgment to the defendants on Migut\u2019s claim for declaratory relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b289-11\">.
