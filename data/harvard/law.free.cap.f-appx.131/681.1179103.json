We granted a certificate of appealability on the following two issues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b707-22\">Whether the district court violated <em>Clisby v. Jones, </em>960 F.2d 925, 938 (11th Cir.1992) <em>(en banc), </em>by failing to address appellant\u2019s claims that his trial counsel was ineffective for not objecting to prosecutorial misconduct during closing argument?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b707-23\">Whether the district court erred by finding that appellant\u2019s trial counsel was not ineffective for failing to argue that appellant was tried after the term of court when his indictment was filed? <em>See </em>Fla. Stat. \u00a7 907.055.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b707-24\">The government concedes error with respect to the first of these issues: the district court did not address all of Naylor\u2019s claims. Accordingly, we vacate the district court\u2019s final judgment and remand this case for further consideration. <em>See Clisby, </em>960 F.2d at 938. We do not reach the second issue on which we granted a COA; to do so would defeat the whole purpose of the <em>Clisby </em>rule, which is to avoid piecemeal adjudication of issues in a habeas case. <em>Id. </em>at 936-98. Either the district court or this Court may grant a COA on the second issue should a subsequent appeal follow the remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-25\">VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
