Booker, </em>543 U.S.-, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). We previously affirmed Appellant\u2019s 46-month sentence, imposed after his plea of guilty, for conspiracy to import 100 kilograms or more of marijuana, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 952(a), 960(b)(2). <em>See United States v. Padilla, </em>127 Fed. Appx. 471 (11th Cir.2004) (unpublished). The Supreme Court vacated our prior decision and remanded the case to us for further consideration in light of <em>Booker.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b249-12\">In his initial brief, Appellant argued that, because he was a hired employee and did not have an ownership interest in the marijuana he attempted to import or the vessel which he used in this smuggling attempt, the district court erred by denying his request for a two-level reduction in offense level for playing a minor role in the offense, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2. Notably, he raised no constitutional sentencing challenge, nor did he otherwise assert error based on <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), or any other case extending or applying the <em>Apprendi </em>principle.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-13\">In <em>United States v. Ardley, </em>242 F.3d 989 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>533 U.S. 962, 121 S.Ct. 2621, 150 L.Ed.2d 774 (2001), after the Supreme Court\u2019s remand with instructions to reconsider our opinion in light of <em>Apprendi, </em>we observed the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b249-15\">Nothing in the <em>Apprendi </em>opinion requires or suggests that we are obligated to consider an issue not raised in any of the briefs that appellant has filed with us. Nor is there anything in the Supreme Court\u2019s remand order, which is cast in the usual language, requiring that we treat the case as though the <em>Apprendi </em>issue had been timely raised in this Court. In the absence of any requirement to the contrary in either <em>Apprendi </em>or in the order remanding this case to us, we apply our well-established rule that issues and contentions not timely raised in the briefs are deemed abandoned.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b249-16\"><em>Id. </em>at 990 (citations omitted); <em>see also United States v. Nealy, </em>232 F.3d 825, 830 (11th Cir.2000) (\u201cDefendant abandoned the <em>[Apprendi] </em>indictment issue by not raising the issue in his initial brief.\u201d). We recently extended the foregoing rale to preclude untimely challenges based on <em>Booker. See United States v. Dockery, </em>401 F.3d 1261 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b249-17\">In his initial brief in this case, Padilla asserted no <em>Apprendi </em>(or its progeny) challenge to his sentence. Accordingly, we reinstate our previous opinion in this case and affirm, once again, Padilla\u2019s sentence after our reconsideration in light of <em>Booker, </em>pursuant to the Supreme Court\u2019s mandate.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-18\">OPINION REINSTATED; SENTENCE AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
