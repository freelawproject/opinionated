He argues that the district court\u2019s order of $8,000 in restitution was plain error because, pursuant to the plea agreement, he agreed to pay only $2,500 in restitution. He also argues that the order of restitution violates <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), because it was based on facts not proven to a jury or admitted by him.</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-4\">Given that the mutual understanding of the parties was that the counterfeiting conspiracy charge was based upon an underlying scheme of conduct involving $2,500 and not $3,000 and given that the district court accepted the plea agreement, which included in its terms a restitution requirement of $2,500, the order of $3,000 in restitution was an error that was plain and that affected Pea\u2019s substantial rights because he was sentenced to an amount of restitution higher than agreed to in the plea agreement. <em>See United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 732, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993); <em>United States v. Adams, </em>363 F.3d 363, 365-67 (5th Cir.2004); <em>McClure v. Ashcroft, </em>335 F.3d 404, 413 (5th Cir. 2003). In addition, the error affected the fairness and integrity of the judicial proceeding. <em>See United States v. Aderholt, </em>87 F.3d 740, 744 (5th Cir.1996). Accordingly, the district court\u2019s order of restitution is VACATED and the case is REMANDED for recalculation of the restitution order. Given that the restitution order will be recalculated, we do not address Pea\u2019s <em>Blakely </em>argument. Pea\u2019s sentence is otherwise AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-10\">AFFIRMED IN PART; VACATED AND REMANDED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1001-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
