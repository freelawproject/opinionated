Holton was convicted by a jury of willfully failing to pay court-ordered child support from on or about June 1998 through September 15, 2003, in violation of 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 228(a)(3) (West 2000). Holton appeals his conviction, asserting that the evidence was insufficient to support it. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-22\">Holton contends that the Government failed to prove that he acted willfully. To determine if there was sufficient evidence to support a conviction, this court considers whether, taking the evidence in the light most favorable to the Government, substantial evidence supports the jury\u2019s verdict. <em>Glasser v. United States, </em>315 U.S. 60, 80, 62 S.Ct. 457, 86 L.Ed. 680 (1942); <em>United States v. Wills, </em>346 F.3d 476, 495 (4th Cir.2003), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S.-, 124 S.Ct. 2906, 159 L.Ed.2d 816 (2004). Substantial evidence is defined as \u201cthat evidence which \u2018a reasonable finder of fact could accept as adequate and sufficient to support a conclusion of a defendant\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d \u2019 <em>United States v. Newsome, </em>322 F.3d 328, 333 (4th Cir.2003) (quoting <em>United States v. Burgos, </em>94 F.3d 849, 862 (4th Cir.1996) (en banc)). The court reviews both direct and circumstantial evidence and permits <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>\u201cthe [Government the benefit of all reasonable inferences from the facts proven to those sought to be established.\u201d <em>United States v. Tresvant, </em>677 F.2d 1018, 1021 (4th Cir.1982). \u201c[A]n appellate court\u2019s reversal of a conviction on grounds of insufficient evidence should be \u2018confined to cases where the prosecution\u2019s failure is clear.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Jones, </em>735 F.2d 785, 791 (4th Cir.1984) (quoting <em>Burks v. United States, </em>437 U.S. 1, 17, 98 S.Ct. 2141, 57 L.Ed.2d 1 (1978)). Witness credibility is within the sole province of the jury, and the court will not reassess the credibility of testimony. <em>United States v. Saunders, </em>886 F.2d 56, 60 (4th Cir.1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b52-4\">With these standards in mind, we conclude from the mat\u00e9rials on appeal that sufficient evidence supports the jury\u2019s conclusion that Holton willfully failed to pay child support during the period charged in the indictment. <em>See United State v. Mattice, </em>186 F.3d 219, 225 (2d Cir.1999) (defining willfulness as \u201cvoluntary, intentional violation of a known legal duty\u201d)(internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Accordingly, we affirm Holton\u2019s conviction and sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
