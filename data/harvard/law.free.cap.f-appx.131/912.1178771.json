Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b939-6\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b939-7\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b938-11\"> Whitlock has not raised a claim under <em>United States v. </em>Booker,-U.S.-, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), or <em>Blakely </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004).
