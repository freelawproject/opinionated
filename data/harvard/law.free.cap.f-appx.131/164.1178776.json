In support of this claim, Jones argued: (1) severance was necessary to preclude admission of the co-defendant\u2019s statement, which implicated Jones; and (2) the introduction of evidence concerning witness-tampering charges against the co-defendant prejudiced him. On appeal, Jones argues the district court erred by denying his severance claim without addressing both of these arguments, in violation of <em>Clisby v. Jones, </em>960 F.2d 925 (11th Cir. 1992) <em>(en </em>banc). The State concedes that the district court did not address both arguments, but urges us to affirm the denial of Jones\u2019s \u00a7 2254 petition because Smith waived the <em>Clisby </em>claim by failing to object to the magistrate judge\u2019s report in the district court.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b191-18\">We review the district court\u2019s grant or denial of a habeas corpus petition under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 <em>de novo. Sims v. Singletary, </em>155 F.3d 1297, 1304 (11th Cir.1998). After thorough review of the record and careful consideration of the briefs, we con-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>elude the district court did not comply with <em>Clisby </em>as to one of Jones\u2019s claims\u2014the claim that severance was warranted based on admission of the evidence of witness-tampering charges against his co-defendant. Thus, we vacate and remand this matter to the district court for consideration of that issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-4\">In <em>Clisby, </em>we expressed concern over \u201cpiecemeal litigation\u201d in habeas petitions and explained that judicial economy is better served by a full disposition of all claims in a petition. <em>See </em>960 F.2d at 935-36. We noted that pending federal habeas proceedings \u201ccast doubt on a prisoner\u2019s conviction and interfere with the state\u2019s administration of its corrections program.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 935 (quotations omitted). For this reason, we have instructed district courts to resolve all claims for relief raised in a \u00a7 2254 petition, \u201cregardless of whether habeas relief is granted or denied.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 936. To do otherwise would allow an abundance of piecemeal litigation to wreak havoc upon the federal and state court systems. <em>Id. </em>at 938.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-5\">In accordance with the teachings of <em>Clisby, </em>and as conceded by the State, the district court failed to address Jones\u2019s claim concerning the denial of a severance based on the witness-tampering charges against Jones\u2019s co-defendant.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We are unpersuaded by the State\u2019s argument that Jones waived the ability to assert a violation of <em>Clisby </em>by not objecting to the magistrate judge\u2019s report. For this proposition, the State relies on <em>Nettles v. Wainwright, </em>677 F.2d 404, 410 (5th Cir. Unit B 1982).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> That case is not on point because it concerned the effect on a party seeking a <em>de novo </em>determination by a district judge after failing to file written objections to proposed findings and recommendations in a magistrate judge\u2019s report, filed pursuant to Title 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(b)(1). <em>Id. </em>at 410. In <em>Nettles, </em>we held that a party who had not filed written objections waived the ability to challenge, either before the district court or on appeal to this Court, the magistrate judge\u2019s factual findings. <em>Id. </em>However, <em>Nettles </em>does not preclude this Court from reviewing a district court\u2019s conclusions of law <em>de novo.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b192-9\">In accordance with <em>Clisby, </em>we vacate and remand this matter to the district court for the purpose of adjudicating Jones\u2019s severance claim concerning the admission of evidence that his co-defendant tampered with a witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-10\">VACATED AND REMANDED WITH INSTRUCTIONS.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b191-10\">. The State also urges us to consider the merits of the claims in Jones\u2019s petition. We issued a certificate of appealability to consider the <em>Clisby </em>claim only. Accordingly, consideration of the merits of Jones\u2019s claims is beyond the scope of our review. <em>See Murray v. United States, </em>145 F.3d 1249, 1251 (11th Cir. 1998) (\"[I]n an appeal brought by an unsuccessful habeas petitioner, appellate review is limited to the issues specified in the COA.\u201d). Thus, we decline to consider the merits of the underlying claims.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b192-6\">. We reject, as inconsistent with our well-established policy to liberally construe <em>pro se </em>habeas petitions, the State\u2019s argument that we should read the district court\u2019s general analysis of the severance issue to encompass the instant claim. <em>See Williams v. Griswald, </em>743 F.2d 1533, 1542 (11th Cir.1984) (\"It is well established that the standards governing the sufficiency of habeas corpus petitions are less stringent when the petition is drafted <em>pro se </em>and without the aid of counsel.\"); <em>see also Gunn v. Newsome, </em>881 F.2d 949, 961 (11th Cir.1989) (\"We have never wavered from the rule that courts should construe a habeas petition filed pro se more liberally than one drawn up by an attorney.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b192-12\">. This Court adopted as binding precedent all Fifth Circuit decisions prior to October 1, 1981, and all Fifth Circuit Unit B decisions after October 1, 1981. <em>See Bonner v. City of Prichard, </em>661 F.2d 1206, 1209 (11th Cir.1981) <em>(en banc); Stein v. Reynolds Secs., Inc., </em>667 F.2d 33, 33 (11th Cir.1982). We note that the Fifth Circuit has since overruled <em>Nettles. See Douglass v. United Services Auto. Ass\u2019n, </em>79 F.3d 1415, 1428-29 (5th Cir.1996) <em>{en banc). </em>However, <em>Douglass </em>does not control the binding effect of <em>Nettle </em>in this Circuit because <em>Douglass </em>was decided after October 1, 1981 and was not a Unit B decision.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
