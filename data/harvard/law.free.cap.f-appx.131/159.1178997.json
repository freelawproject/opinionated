Valentin-Morales contends that the district court erred when it found that the underlying deportation proceeding did not violate due process. Valentin-Morales also contends that the 16-point enhancement of his sentence violated the Sixth Amendment. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-11\">An alien may not challenge the validity of a deportation order that forms the basis of a criminal prosecution under 8 U.S.C. section 1326(a)(1) or (b) unless the alien can establish that \u201c(1) the alien exhausted any administrative remedies that may have been available to seek relief against the order; (2) the deportation proceedings at which the order was issued improperly deprived the alien of the opportunity for judicial review; and (3) the entry of the order was fundamentally unfair.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(d). Valentin-Morales contends that his deportation hearing violated due process, because, as the United States concedes, the Immigration Judge (IJ) erroneously informed Valentin-Morales that discretionary relief from deportation was not available.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-13\">We need not resolve the difficult question of whether the error of the IJ violated due process, because we conclude that Valentin-Morales failed to exhaust the administrative remedies available to him. The record shows that the IJ, after ruling that Valentin-Morales was not eligible for any form of relief, asked Valentin-Morales, \u201cDo you accept the court\u2019s decision, or do you wish to appeal that decision, sir?\u201d Valentin-Morales replied, \u201cAccept.\u201d Nothing in the record indicates that Valentin-Morales\u2019s waiver of his right to appeal to the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) was not knowing and intelligent. Although Valentin-Morales contends that the exhaustion requirement did not apply because the IJ erroneously informed Valentin-Morales that discretionary relief was unavailable, we have previously rejected that argument in the context of a habeas corpus challenge to a deportation order. <em>See Sundar v. I.N.S., </em>328 F.3d 1320, 1325-26 (11th Cir.2003). The reasoning of <em>Sundar </em>applies equally here. In addition, if Valentin-Morales \u201cwanted to re-enter the United States and to do so legally, nothing precluded him from seeking a rescission of his deporta<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>tion order even after his removal from the United States.\u201d <em>United States v. Zelaya, </em>293 F.3d 1294, 1297 (11th Cir.2002). Valentin-Morales, therefore, failed to exhaust available administrative remedies. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b187-5\">We further conclude that Valentin-Morales failed to show that he was denied the opportunity for judicial review. The IJ told Valentin-Morales of his right to appeal, and Valentin-Morales rejected the opportunity to appeal not only to the BIA but to this Court as well. Valentin-Morales, therefore, faded to show that the deportation proceedings improperly deprived him of the opportunity for judicial review. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(d)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b187-6\">Valentin-Morales contends that the sentencing enhancement he received violated the Sixth Amendment under <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), the reasoning of which the Supreme Court extended to the federal sentencing guidelines in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). In his plea agreement, Valentin-Morales waived the right to appeal his sentence except in three circumstances: \u201c(1) an upward departure from the otherwise applicable sentencing guideline range; and/or (2) the District Court\u2019s October 31, 2003 Order denying the defendant\u2019s Motions To Dismiss; and/or (3) a finding that the defendant\u2019s criminal history falls in Category VI.\u201d None of those exceptions applies here.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-11\">We have consistently held that appeal waivers are valid if knowingly and voluntarily entered. <em>United States v. Rubbo, </em>396 F.3d 1330, 1331 (11th Cir.2005). Valentin-Morales does not argue that his appeal waiver was not knowing or voluntary. Because the right to appeal a sentence based on <em>Booker </em>\u201ccan be waived in a plea agreement\u201d and \u201c[bjroad waiver language covers those grounds of appeal,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 1335, Valentin-Morales waived his right to appeal his sentence on <em>Booker </em>grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-13\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
