Because Rocha did not object to the upward departure in the district court, this court\u2019s review is for plain error. <em>See United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 519-20 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b461-5\">After Rocha\u2019s appellate brief was filed but before the Government submitted its brief, the Supreme Court issued its decision in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). In <em>Booker, </em>the Supreme Court held that \u201c[a]ny fact (other than a prior conviction) which is necessary to support a sentence exceeding the maximum authorized by the facts established by a plea of guilty or a jury verdict must be admitted by the defendant or proved to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 756. Further, the Court excised 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(b)(1) of the Sentencing Reform Act, rendering the Federal Sentencing Guidelines effectively advisory. <em>Id. </em>at 764-65.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-8\">Even if Rocha could establish <em>Booker </em>error, she has not demonstrated that this error affected her substantial rights. Rocha has failed to point to any evidence in the record indicating that the same sentence would not have been imposed had the district court known that the Guidelines were advisory. The record itself gives no indication that the district court would have reached a different result under an advisory guidelines scheme. The district court, in its discretion, upwardly departed from the 10 to 16 month guideline sentencing range and sentenced Rocha to 28 months of imprisonment based on its determination that the guideline sentencing range was not adequate to take into account Rocha\u2019s criminal conduct and the likelihood of recidivism. Given the lack of evidence indicating that the district court would have reached a different conclusion, Rocha has not demonstrated that her substantial rights were affected, and, thus, she has failed to establish plain error. <em>See Mares, </em>402 F.3d at 520-22.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-10\">Further, the district court\u2019s finding at sentencing that Rocha was engaged in narcotics trafficking was not inconsistent with its earlier finding that Rocha violated a condition of release by failing to report the incident to pretrial services. Thus, Rocha has failed to establish plain error. <em>See id. </em>at 520-21. Accordingly, the district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b460-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
