Washington, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), his sentence was illegal because the district court enhanced his sentence beyond the constitutional maximum. Specifically, Reta-Mendoza contends that the district court erred in basing its enhancement on a prior conviction that was not charged in the indictment and found by a jury beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-17\">We find no error in this case. In the Supreme Court\u2019s most recent pronouncement in this area, <em>United States v. Booker, </em>- U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 738, 756, 160 L.Ed.2d 621, 650 (2005) the Court stated that prior convictions may support a sentence exceeding the maximum authorized by the facts established by a plea of guilty or a jury verdict, even though they were not included in the indictment and found by a jury beyond a reasonable doubt. (\u201cAny fact (other than a prior conviction) which is necessary to support a sentence exceeding the maximum authorized by the facts established by a plea of guilty or a jury verdict must be admitted by the defendant or proved to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d). In this case, the district court enhanced Reta-Mendoza\u2019s sentence based on his prior convictions, and thus, did not err.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-20\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
