R.Crim.P. 33 (\u201cRule 33 motion\u201d). Wright\u2019s Rule 33 motion sought a new trial based on his claims of both newly discovered evidence and newly discovered facts. The district court denied Wright\u2019s Rule 33 motion on February 21,2001, though its order addressed only Wright\u2019s newly discovered evidence claims without mention of his \u201cnewly discovered facts\u201d claim relating to the trial testimony of Charles Williams.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-6\">In August 2004, more than three years after the district court denied his Rule 33 motion, Wright filed a motion for leave to file a belated notice of appeal from that denial. In that motion, Wright argued that he never received notice of the denial of his Rule 33 motion because the copy that was mailed to him was returned to the court as undeliverable. The district court denied Wright\u2019s motion for leave to file a belated appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-7\">On appeal, Wright argues that the district court abused its discretion in denying his motion for leave to file a belated notice of appeal from the denial of his Rule 33 motion. Wright also argues that the district court erred in failing to resolve his newly discovered facts claim as to the testimony of government witness Williams. He asserts that we should issue a writ of mandamus, instructing the district court to resolve this claim for purposes of finality, pursuant to <em>Clisby v. Jones, </em>960 F.2d 925 (11th Cir.1992) <em>(en banc).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b725-8\">BELATED APPEAL</p>\n<p id=\"b725-9\">We review the decision on a motion for an extension of time to appeal for an abuse of discretion. <em>In re Old Naples Sec., Inc., </em>223 F.3d 1296, 1302 n. 7 (11th Cir.2000). \u201cIn a criminal case, a defendant\u2019s notice of appeal must be filed in the district court within 10 days after\u201d the entry of the order being appealed. Fed. R.App. P. 4(b)(l)(A)(i). Although the clerk of court must provide notice to the defendant regarding any order entered on any post-arraignment motion, a clerk\u2019s failure to do so \u201cdoes not affect the time to appeal, or relieve\u2014or authorize the court to relieve\u2014 a party\u2019s failure to appeal within the allowed time.\u201d Fed.R.Crim.P. 49(c). However, upon a finding that the failure to file during the original period resulted from \u201cexcusable neglect or good cause\u201d, the district court may authorize an extension, but only for a period not to \u201cexceed 30 days from the expiration of time otherwise prescribed by this Rule 4(b).\u201d Fed. R.App. P. 4(b)(4); <em>see also, United States v. Grant, </em>256 F.3d 1146, 1150-51 (11th Cir.2001) (\u201cGrant\u2019s second notice of appeal, however, was filed ... more than 30 days late and therefore does not fall within the Rule 4(b)(4) window.\u201d). In addition to Rule 4(b)(4), we also recognize the \u201cunique circumstances doctrine\u201d which excuses failure to abide by time limitations where the failure is caused by the litigant\u2019s reasonable reliance on a judicial officer\u2019s specific assurance. <em>See Jackson v. Crosby, </em>375 F.3d 1291, 1297 (11th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b725-11\">Wright cannot satisfy the criteria for any of the exceptions to the time limitation for filing a notice of appeal. Wright did not file his notice of appeal within the ten days of the district court\u2019s judgment, nor within an additional thirty days beyond that period, precluding application of Rule 4(b)(4). Nor can Wright rely on the unique circumstances doctrine, as Wright\u2019s did not rely upon any \u201cspecific assurance by a judicial offer\u201d in failing to timely file his notice of appeal. <em>See Vencor Hosps. v. Standard Life &amp; Accident Ins. Co., </em>279 F.3d 1306, 1312 (11th Cir.2002) (\u201cCrucial to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number>the application of the unique circumstances doctrine is the occurrence of a judicial action upon which a party relies in failing to file a timely notice of appeal. As a result, the mere failure of the district court clerk\u2019s office to serve Appellant with notice ... does not constitute a judicial assurance or action sufficient to warrant relief under the unique circumstances doctrine.\u201d). We thus conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Wright\u2019s motion to file a belated notice of appeal from the denial of his Rule 33 motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-4\">MANDAMUS</p>\n<p id=\"b726-5\">The issuance of a writ of mandamus is \u201can extraordinary remedy, to be reserved for extraordinary situations.\u201d <em>United States v. Noriega, </em>917 F.2d 1543, 1546 n. 3 (11th Cir.1990) (quotation omitted). The party seeking mandamus bears the burden of demonstrating a \u201cclear and indisputable right to issuance of the writ.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b726-6\">We have exercised our supervisory powers to instruct district courts to resolve all claims for relief raised in a habeas corpus petition regardless of whether habeas relief is ultimately granted or denied. <em>Clisby, </em>960 F.2d at 936. However, our holding in <em>Clisby </em>arose out of concern for the increasingly piecemeal nature of federal habeas corpus litigation, and its holding is limited by its own terms to habeas cases. <em>Id. Clisby </em>thus provides no basis for a writ of mandamus regarding the district court\u2019s failure to specifically address Wright\u2019s Rule 33 claim relating to government witness Williams.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-7\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b726-8\">Upon review of the record and the parties\u2019 briefs, we find no reversible error. Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s denial of Wright\u2019s motion for leave to file a belated appeal from the denial of his Rule 33 motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
