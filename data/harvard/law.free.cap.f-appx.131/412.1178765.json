We must uphold the decision to deny benefits if the decision is supported by substantial evidence and the correct law was applied. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g) (2000); <em>Craig v. Chater, </em>76 F.3d 585, 589 (4th Cir.1996). Having thoroughly reviewed the administrative record, we agree with the district court that substantial evidence supports the Commissioner\u2019s final decision denying benefits. Accordingly, we affirm for the reasons stated by the district court. <em>See Everette v. Barnhart, </em>No. CA-02-48H (E.D.N.C. Sept. 8, 2004). We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-11\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
