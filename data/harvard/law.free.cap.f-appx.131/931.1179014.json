Tinong challenges the IJ\u2019s finding that she failed to present credible testimony and thus did not meet her burden of proof to qualify for asylum.</p>\n<p id=\"b957-22\">To obtain reversal of a determination denying eligibility for relief, an alien \u201cmust show that the evidence he presented was so compelling that no reasonable factfinder could fail to find the requisite fear of persecution.\u201d <em>INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 483-84, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992). We have reviewed the evidence of record and conclude that the IJ\u2019s negative credibility findings are supported by specific, cogent reasons. <em>Figeroa v. INS, </em>886 F.2d 76, 78 (4th Cir.1989). Accordingly, Tinong fails to show that the evidence compels a contrary result.</p>\n<p id=\"b957-23\">Finally, we lack jurisdiction over Tinong\u2019s challenge to the denial of her applications for withholding of removal and protection under the Convention Against Torture because she failed to properly exhaust these claims in her appeal to the Board. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d)(1) (2000); <em>Asika v. Ashcroft, </em>362 F.3d 264, 267 n. 3 (4th Cir.2004), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 125 S.Ct. 861, 160 L.Ed.2d 769 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b957-26\">Accordingly, we deny the petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process. Respondent\u2019s motions to strike documents in the joint appendix and to file a supplemental appendix are denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b957-27\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
