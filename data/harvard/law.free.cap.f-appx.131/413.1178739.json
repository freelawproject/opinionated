On November 10, 2004, the district court sentenced Estimable, over his objection based upon <em>Blakely v. Washington,</em>\u2014U.S.-, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), to a twenty-four-month term of imprisonment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>to be followed by three years of supervised release. After Estimable filed his notice of appeal, the Supreme Court decided <em>United States v. Booker,</em>\u2014U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). The Government has filed an unopposed motion to remand for resentencing in light of the <em>Booker </em>decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-6\">We grant the motion for remand to allow the district court to reconsider Estimable\u2019s sentence in light of the <em>Booker </em>decision. Estimable\u2019s formal brief on appeal reveals that the applicability of <em>Booker </em>is the only issue that he wishes to pursue on appeal. Therefore, we affirm his conviction, vacate the sentence imposed by the district court, and remand for reconsideration of the sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-7\">\n<em>AFFIRMED IN PANT, VACATED IN PART, AND REMANDED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
