The district court denied Rodriguez-Saucedo\u2019s request for sentencing under the safety-valve provision of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5C1.2 and sentenced him to the statutory minimum sentence of ten years in prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-5\">Rodriguez-Saucedo argues that the district court did not follow the correct legal standard when evaluating the merits of his request for a safety valve reduction under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5C1.2. A review of the sentencing transcript reveals that the court understood that it, and not the parties, decides whether the defendant has met his burden of satisfying U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5C1.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-6\">Rodriguez-Saucedo also argues that the district court clearly erred when it determined that he had not provided the Government with all the information he knew about the offense. The court noted that the 14 kilograms of cocaine found hidden in Rodriguez-Saucedo\u2019s car had been packaged and hidden \u201cin a rather sophisticated manner,\u201d that Rodriguez-Saucedo was unable to give the officers sufficient information to locate the man who had recruited him to smuggle the cocaine, and that Rodriguez-Saucedo\u2019s allegations of duress were unpersuasive. The record supports the district court\u2019s finding that Rodriguez-Saucedo was ineligible for sentencing under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5C1.2. <em>See United States v. Ridgeway, </em>321 F.3d 512, 516 (5th Cir.2003); <em>see also United States v. Angeles-Mendoza, </em>407 F.3d 742 (5th Cir. 2005). The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1008-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"983\">*983</page-number>published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
