Does the 120 days begin to run after the application interview or after the background investigation is complete? The district court held the latter and dismissed the case for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. Reviewing the record <em>de novo,</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>we reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-12\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-13\">Shabir Hussein Walji, a Ugandan native and Canadian citizen, has been a lawful permanent resident of the United States since October 16,1980. Walji filed a Form N-400 Application for Naturalization with the CIS in September 2003. An immigration officer interviewed Walji on April 6, 2004 and informed Walji that he passed the English language, U.S. history, and U.S. government proficiency examinations. However, the officer informed Walji that action on his application would not proceed until the FBI completed a mandatory national security background check.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-18\">When Walji received no answer on his application, he began asking questions. The record is replete with correspondence between Walji and various officials. Two years and a day after his first examination, Walji filed this lawsuit and asked the district court to (1) assume jurisdiction over and adjudicate his application for naturalization or (2) compel the defendants to perform their duty to adjudicate his application.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-19\">The district court held that the 120-day period for approval or denial of the application begins to run only when all of the application requirements are complete and that Walji\u2019s application was not complete because the FBI had not concluded its background investigation. Because the 120-day period was never triggered, the district court held that it lacked jurisdiction over Walji\u2019s lawsuit and dismissed it.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-20\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-21\">An applicant for Citizenship must first submit a completed Form N-400 Application for Naturalization to the CIS. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 334.2(a). After the application is filed, CIS \u201cshall [if not waived] conduct an investigation of the applicant\u201d that includes, at a minimum, \u201ca review of all pertinent records\u201d and \u201cpolice department checks.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 335.1. The examination and investigation of the applicant is prescribed in 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1446.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Once the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>investigation is completed, each applicant \u201cshall appear in person\u201d before a CIS officer for an examination. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 335.2(a). The \u201cexamination\u201d includes questioning by the officer about matters the applicant has included in the written submissions in addition to tests administered on \u201cEnglish literacy and basic knowledge of the history and government of the United States.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 335.2(c). The regulations provide that the examination is to be conducted only after the FBI has provided a \u201cdefinitive response that a full criminal background check of the applicant has been completed\u201d by confirming (1) the applicant has no administrative or criminal record, (2) the applicant has an administrative or criminal record, or (3) the FBI cannot definitively respond because the necessary fingerprints analysis cannot be completed on the available information. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 335.2(b)(l)-(3). \u201cA decision to grant or deny the application shall be made at the time of the initial examination or within 120-days after the date of the initial examination of the applicant for naturalization under \u00a7 335.2.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 335.3(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b474-4\">If the CIS does not issue a decision within 120 days of the examination, applicants may seek judicial relief under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1447(b), which states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b474-5\">If there is a failure to make a determination [on the application for naturalization] before the end of the 120-day period after the date on which the examination is conducted under such section, the applicant may apply to the United States district court for the district in which the applicant resides for a hearing on the matter. Such court has jurisdiction over the matter and may either determine the matter or remand the matter, with appropriate instructions, to the [CIS] to determine the matter.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b474-8\">It is this statute under which Walji now seeks judicial intervention.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-9\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-10\">Whether the district court has jurisdiction over Walji\u2019s lawsuit hinges upon the statutory application of the term \u201cexamination\u201d in \u00a7 1447(b). The Government argues that the term \u201cexamination\u201d refers to the entire investigative process, including the FBI\u2019s security check of an applicant, and until that check is completed, the 120-day period referenced in the section does not begin to run. Walji contends that by \u201cexamination\u201d the statute refers to the interview of an applicant, which in his case occurred two years \u2014 well over 120 days \u2014 before he initiated this lawsuit. Walji thus argues that his 120-day time period began to run on the date of the examination by the immigration officer, notwithstanding the fact that the FBI <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>had not completed its background investigation.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b475-5\">Numerous district courts have decided the issue, reaching opposite conclusions. One of the earliest district courts to consider the issue adopted the position advanced by the Government, concluding that \u201can examination is not a single event, but instead is essentially a <em>process </em>the agency follows to gather information concerning the applicant,\u201d which includes the FBI\u2019s security check. <em>Danilov v. Aguirre, </em>370 F.Supp.2d 441, 443-44 (E.D.Va.2005) (emphasis in original). Therefore, the <em>Danilov </em>court held, the \u201cexamination\u201d cannot be considered complete until after the FBI concludes its background investigation of an applicant and, as a consequence, courts lack subject matter jurisdiction before the lapse of 120 days after the entire process has been completed. <em>Id. </em>Adopting the district court\u2019s analysis in <em>Danilov, </em>a handful of district courts have also held that the 120-day period is not triggered until all aspects of the application process are completed, including the FBI background check.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b475-14\">However, the majority of courts addressing this issue have concluded that the term \u201cexamination\u201d in \u00a7 1447(b) refers to a discrete event \u2014 the agency\u2019s initial interview of the applicant \u2014 and that the 120-day period begins to run as of the date that interview is concluded.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Generally, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>these courts reject the <em>Danilov </em>court\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 1447(b) for three reasons: the plain language of \u00a7 1447(b), the clear inferences to be drawn from the total statutory and regulatory scheme, and the stated legislative purpose of \u00a7 1447(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b476-4\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-5\">First, the statute\u2019s language that the 120-day period begins to run after \u201cthe date on which the examination is conducted,\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1447(b), \u201ccontemplates that the examination occurs on a particular, identifiable date.\u201d <em>EV-Daour, </em>417 F.Supp.2d at 681. Thus, the plain language suggests that the examination is a distinct, single event \u2014 the date on which the interview occurs \u2014 triggering the 120-day period, and not an ongoing fluid process encompassing the interview as well as the background investigation. <em>Id. </em>(stating that \u201c[a] \u2018process\u2019 does not occur on one particular and identifiable date.\u201d). Further, the term \u201cconducted\u201d would have to be construed to mean \u201ccompleted or concluded\u201d to reach the conclusion that the examination required by the statute is considered the \u201cprocess of examination.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(refusing to consider \u201cthat Congress was so sloppy in its lexicography.\u201d). If the statute is intended to set a certain date for the Service to decide, it would have to be the time of the examination. Of course, the Service need not conduct the examination until after the investigation is concluded.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-6\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-7\">Second, the statutory scheme contemplates a distinction between the investigation and the examination, the latter being a discrete rather than a continuous event. The organization of the INA section preceding \u00a7 1447 indicates that the investigative process is separate from the examination. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1446 (entitled \u201cInvestigation of applicants; examination of applications,\u201d with subsection (a) referencing what is required for the CIS <em>investigation </em>of the applicant and subsection (b) separately addressing the procedural requirements for the <em>examination </em>of the applicant). Section 1446 further differentiates between the two procedures. Whereas an \u201cexamination\u201d must be conducted by an employee of CIS designated by the Attorney General, an \u201cinvestigation\u201d may be conducted by an employee of CIS or an employee of the United States the Attorney General designates. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b476-9\">CIS\u2019s implementing regulations also indicate that the agency itself interprets the investigation as a separate and distinct precedent to the examination, not a subset thereof, and that \u201cexamination\u201d means the initial interview and not the entire process. <em>Compare </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 335.2(a), (c), (e), (entitled \u201cExamination of Applicant\u201d and providing for an in-person under-oath appearance of the applicant before a CIS officer with, if requested, an attorney and/or interpreter; permitting witnesses and subpoenas; and requiring the making of a record) <em>with id. </em>\u00a7 335.2(b) (entitled \u201cCompletion of criminal background checks before examination\u201d and stating that the FBI background check must be completed before the applicant is notified to appear for the examination). We agree with the <em>EV-Daour </em>court that a thorough reading of 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 335.2 reveals that the regulation \u201ccan only be understood as equating \u2018examination\u2019 with the \u2018interview\u2019 conducted by the Service officer.\u201d 417 F.Supp.2d at 683; <em>see also Manzoor v. Chertoff, </em>472 F.Supp.2d 801, 807 (E.D.Va.2007) (\u201cIt is clear from the plain language of these regulations that the term \u2018examination\u2019 in 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1447(b) means the initial interview of an applicant by CIS.\u201d); Richard D. Steel, Steel on Immigration Law \u00a7 15.20 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>(2d ed.1992, updated through August 2007) (\u201cThe <em>examination </em>generally involves an <em>interview </em>of the applicant by a naturalization examiner.\u201d (emphasis added)). We also agree with the court in <em>Khelifa v. Chertoff, </em>433 F.Supp.2d 836, 841 (E.D.Mich.2006) that, with respect to 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 335.2(b), \u201c[b]y referring separately to the FBI background check and the \u2018initial examination,\u2019 and mandating that the former must be completed before the latter will be conducted, this provision plainly contemplates that the background check is independent from, as opposed to a part of, the \u2018examination.\u2019 ... This provision ... is incompatible with any notion of an examination as a process that encompasses a criminal background investigation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b477-6\">CIS regulations also indicate that the agency intends that the 120-day period in \u00a7 1447(b) begins to run from the date of the initial examination. The regulation at 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 335.3(a) states in part: \u201cA decision to grant or deny the application shall be made at the time of the initial examination or within 120-days after the date of the <em>initial examination </em>of the applicant for naturalization under \u00a7 335.2.\u201d (emphasis added). The plain language of this section instructs the CIS that the 120-day period begins to run after the initial examination and not after conclusion of the entire naturalization process. The language of these regulations, like the language of the statute itself, is plain.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-7\">Other regulations also support the interpretation that the 120-day period was meant to begin running on the date of the initial interview. For instance, if deficiencies in an application are discovered during an \u201cexamination,\u201d the CIS may reschedule one reexamination under timing constraints pursuant to 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 335.3(b), which states that \u201c[t]he reexamination on the continued case shall be scheduled within the 120-day period after the initial examination .... \u201d There would be no purpose to specifically permit \u201cone reexamination\u201d if examination includes the process of investigation. <em>Daami v. Gonzales, </em>No. 05-3667, 2006 WL 1457862, at *5 (D.N.J. May 22, 2006). This regulation should be considered in conjunction with 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 312.5(b), which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b477-9\">Before an applicant may request a postponement of the second examination to a date that is more than 90 days after the initial examination, the applicant must agree in writing to <em>waive the requirement </em>under section 336 of the Act that the [CIS] <em>must render a determination on the application within 120 days from the initial interview, </em>and instead to permit the [CIS] to render a decision with 120 days from the second interview,</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AXd\">(emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b477-10\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-11\">Third, legislative history further supports the majority\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 1447(b). The 120-day limit was put into place when Congress enacted the Immigration Act of 1990 (the \u201cAct\u201d). <em>See </em>Immigration Act of 1990, Pub.L. 101-649, \u00a7 407, 104 Stat. 4978, 5044. Unfortunately, the Act\u2019s legislative history does not discuss the 120-day period. <em>See Manzoor v. Chertoff, </em>472 F.Supp.2d 801, 807-08 (E.D.Va. 2007) (noting that while the Act was described in a committee and conference report, neither mentioned the 120-day limit). But as the <em>Manzoor </em>court notes, in 1989, the Committee on the Judiciary drafted a report discussing the purpose of a proposed bill that would amend \u00a7 1447(b) so that it would read as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b477-12\">Where there has been a failure to make a determination under [\u00a7 1446] before the end of the 90-day period after the date on which the examination is conducted under such section, the United <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>States district court for the district in which the applicant resides shall upon the demand of the petitioner exercise exclusive jurisdiction over the matter.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AsX\"><em>See </em>H.R.Rep. No. 101-187, at 34 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b478-4\">The report explains that \u201c[t]he bill provides that the applicant may petition the court after <em>90 days of the interview </em>on an application if a decision has not been made on the case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 14 (emphasis added). The report continues: \u201c[i]t is expected that INS will move expeditiously after full investigation of the facts to calendar cases for examination and decision.\u201d <em>Id. </em>This makes it clear that the term \u201cexamination\u201d referred to the CIS\u2019s interview of an applicant. When Congress later established a 120-day limit in 1990, it used virtually identical language as that used in the proposed 1989 legislation. <em>Compare id. </em>at 34, <em>with </em>Immigration Act of 1990 \u00a7 407, 104 Stat. at 5044.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-5\">Further, we believe the definition of \u201cexamination\u201d in \u00a7 1447(b) urged by the Government, which would permit virtually unbounded time to respond to naturalization applications, is contrary to the intended purpose of Congress in passing the Immigration and Nationality Act. A central purpose of the statute was to reduce the waiting time for naturalization applicants. H.R.Rep. No. 101-187, at 8 (1989); 135 Cong. Rec. H4539-02, H4542 (1989) (statement of Rep. Morrison).</p>\n<p id=\"b478-6\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-7\">Finally, the weight of the majority\u2019s interpretation is augmented by the fact that two circuit courts considering a related question \u2014 whether an applicant\u2019s suit under \u00a7 1447(b) deprives the CIS of jurisdiction over the application' \u2014 concluded without analysis that where the INS, had not acted within 120 days of the applicants\u2019 initial <em>interviews, </em>upon the applicants\u2019 filing suit the district court took exclusive jurisdiction over their naturalization applications. <em>See Etape v. Chertoff, </em>497 F.3d 379, 381, 386-87, 2007 WL 2200286, at *1, *6 (4th Cir.2007) (\u201cThe 120-day period under \u00a7 1447(b) does not even begin to run until after the initial naturalization examination; because many of the CIS\u2019s investigatory functions take place before or during that initial naturalization examination .... \u201d); <em>United States v. Hovsepian, </em>359 F.3d 1144, 1151 (9th Cir.2004) (en banc) (\u201c[Section 1447(b)] provides that, if the INS fails to make a decision regarding a naturalization application within 120 days of an applicant\u2019s <em>first interview </em>the applicant may [seek a judicial hearing] on the matter.\u201d (emphasis added)).</p>\n<p id=\"b478-10\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-11\">We are mindful of Congress\u2019s intent that an FBI background check is to be completed before the adjudication of every naturalization application.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> We are also not oblivious to the increased workload the FBI has faced since the events of September 11, 2001 and in particular its backlog of name check requests caused by the resubmission of many requests by the immigration services.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>But if the triggering date were the date on which the entire process was concluded, irrespective of the interview date, the applicant would have no recourse for delays and courts could do nothing to encourage or require the CIS and the FBI to act in a timely fashion. That would entirely erase the effect of \u00a7 1447.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-5\">It is clear in this case that events have occurred \u2014 or not occurred \u2014 out of order. Before the officer administered the examination to Walji, the FBI was supposed to provide a \u201cdefinitive response\u201d that its background investigation was complete. That did not happen. Instead the officer went ahead with the examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-6\">The plethora of unpublished district court opinions on this issue may indicate that CIS finds some utility in proceeding without the FBI\u2019s response. But because there is currently no required period of time for CIS to conduct the initial interview, CIS could avoid the jurisdiction of the courts by following its own order of events.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> As a practical matter, this may yet result in long waiting times for applicants.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Nevertheless, because the clear intent of Congress was to accelerate naturalization applications, and the statutory and regulatory language gives a definite time frame for decision once an examination has occurred, the statute is violated in situations such as Walji\u2019s. <em>Id. </em>That the CIS failed to follow its own protocol in the instant case does not provide support for the Government\u2019s statutory interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-8\">Because Walji\u2019s interview has been conducted and his background check has now been completed, we are satisfied that the district court will remand to the Service where there should be no impediment to the prompt resolution of the application.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-9\">Judgment REVERSED; cause REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b473-14\">. <em>Ghanem v.
