And as to said note, the defendant says the plaintiffs ought not to maintain their said action, because he says that heretofore, to-wit: on the 19th day of October, 1874, at the said county, the plaintiffs and the defendant entered into a contract in writing, which said contract is as follows, to-wit:</p> <p id=\"b423-10\" pgmap=\"423\">\u201c Know all men by these presents, that we, Henry F. IngerboII and Wm. Babcock, Sr., of the county of Fulton, State of Illinois, are held and firmly bound unto Nicholas Hamende, of the county of Iroquois, State of Illinois, in the penal sum of eight thousand eight hundred dollars, for the payment of which well and truly to be made, we bind ourselves, our heirs, executors, administrators and assigns, and every of them, firmly by these presents.

That the defendant, in pursuance to said contract, on the first day of March, A. D. 1875, entered into the possession of the said land in said contract described. And that afterwards, to wit: on the fifth day of October, A. D. 1878, the defendant having failed to pay the said note in said declaration mentioned, and the notes maturing thereafter in said contract mentioned, the plaintiffs having on the fourth day of October, A..D. 1878, demanded possession of said premises,in writing, and without giving the thirty days\u2019 notice in said contract mentioned, commenced an action of forcible detainer before Asa B. Boff, Esq., one of the justices of the peace of said county, for the recovery of the possession of said land, in which said action the said plaintiffs were plaintiffs and the defendant was defendant; and in which said action such proceedings were had that a judgment was afterwards, to wit: on the 11th day of October, A. D. 1878, rendered therein in favor of said plaintiffs, and against the defendant, awarding to said plaintiffs the possession of said land, which said judgment is now in full force and effect; and afterwards, to wit: on the 16th day of October, A. D. 1878, possession of said land was, by virtue of said judgment, delivered by the defendant to the plaintiffs. And the defendant alleges that the plaintiffs thereby elected to declare, and hath thereby declared the said contract forfeited, and at an end, and hath thereby released and discharged the defendant from the payment of the said note in said declaration mentioned, and this the defendant is ready to verify, wherefore he prays judgment.</p> <p id=\"b426-5\" pgmap=\"426\">\u201c By Tbacy B. Hab\u00e9is,</p> <p id=\"b426-6\" pgmap=\"426\">\u201c Defendant\u2019s Att\u2019y.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b426-7\" pgmap=\"426(170) 427(122)\">To this plea the plaintiffs interposed a demurrer, which was overruled by the County Court, and the only question here presented is whether the court erred in passing upon the sufficiency of that plea, which we think is very manifest. It appears from the record that the forcible detainer proceeding before the justice of the peace was not commenced until after the suit was brought upon the note in question. Hence the defense, if available at all, should have been pleaded pt\u00fas darrein continuance. But the plea presented no substantial defense to the action. Counsel argue the case as if it was a breach of the contract on the part of the appellants to bring suit to recover possession of the premises described in it, and therefore appellee had the right to declare a rescission. The fault in the reasoning consists in assuming a fact 'that does not exist. There is not a word in the contract about the right of the vendee to retain possession of the premises until the expiration of the time fixed for the payment of the whole of the consideration money, and it is only by inference that the contract permitted him to take possession of the lands bargained for. In Wilburn v. Haines, 53 Ill. 207, it was held that the bringing of a suit by the vendor against the vendee to recover possession of the premises, did not amount to a rescission of the contract. It is true that it does not appear in the case whether the vendee entered into possession under the contract by a verbal or written permission from the vendor, yet we are unable to discover any distinguishable difference between the two cases.</p> <p id=\"b427-4\" pgmap=\"427\">, There is no pretense in this case that the vendors had ever expressed any intention to declare a forfeiture of the contract; but on the contrary, were seeking to enforce it by bringing suit on the note for a portion of the consideration money, and as there is nothing in the contract to prevent them from taking possession, the vendor\u2019s had the right, as was said in Wilburn v. Haines, to \u201c enjoy the premises while the contract was maturing.\u201d The statute of 1861 incorporated in the revised laws of 1874, \u00a7 2, p. 535, was passed to provide for just such cases as this, where the vendee had been let into possession under a contract of purchase and neglected to pay the consideration, as agreed upon, he should not be allowed to take advantage of his own neglect, and retain the possession against the will of the vendor, without any election on his part to declare a forfeiture if the right existed. The case of Williams v. Forbes, 47 Ill. 148, referred to by counsel for appellee, where the facts were similar to those appearing in this case, except that the plea did not aver that the vendee entered into possession by virtue of the contract, notwithstanding it was there held that the plea was no sufficient answer to the declaration on the note, still counsel assert if the plea had alleged that the vendee entered into possession under the contract by the terms of it, then the plea would have been held good.</p> <p id=\"b427-5\" pgmap=\"427\">The court declined to express any opinion in such a case, and ' the assumption is wholly unauthorized.</p> <p id=\"b427-6\" pgmap=\"427\">The judgment of the court beloAv is therefore reversed and the cause remanded. Reversed and remanded.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
