STEVEN AGEE.\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Jeremy Jaynes appeals from the judgment of the Court of Appeals which affirmed his convictions in the Circuit Court of Loudoun County for violations of Code \u00a7 18.2.452.3:1, the unsolicited bulk electronic mail (e-mail) provision of the Virginia Computer Crimes Act, Code \u00a7\u00a7 18.2-152.1 through-152.15. For the reasons set forth below, we will affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   I. BACKGROUND AND MATERIAL PROCEEDINGS BELOW\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   From his home in Raleigh, North Carolina, Jaynes used several computers, routers and servers to send over 10,000 e-mails within a 24-hour period to subscribers of America Online, Inc. (AOL) on each of three separate occasions. On July 16, 2003, Jaynes sent 12,197 pieces of unsolicited e-mail with falsified routing and transmission information onto AOL's proprietary network. On July 19, 2003, he sent 24,172, and on July 26, 2003, he sent 19,104. None of the recipients of the e-mails had requested any communication from Jaynes. He intentionally falsified the header information and sender domain names before transmitting the e-mails to the recipients, causing the Internet Protocol (IP) addresses to convey false information to every recipient about Jaynes' identity as the sender.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   However, investigators used a sophisticated database search to identify Jaynes as the sender of the e-mails.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Jaynes was arrested and charged with violating Code \u00a7 18.2-152.3:1, which provides in relevant part:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   A. Any person who:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   1. Uses a computer or computer network with the intent to falsify or forge electronic mail transmission information or other routing information in any manner in connection with the transmission of unsolicited bulk electronic mail through or into the computer network of an electronic mail service provider or its subscribers . . . is guilty of a Class 1 misdemeanor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   B. A person is guilty of a Class 6 felony if he commits a violation of subsection A and:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   1. The volume of UBE transmitted exceeded 10,000 attempted recipients in any 24-hour period, 100,000 attempted recipients in any 30-day time period, or one million attempted recipients in any one-year time period. . . .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Jaynes moved to dismiss the charges against him on the grounds that the statute violated the dormant. Commerce Clause, was unconstitutionally vague, and violated the First Amendment. The circuit court denied that motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   During trial, evidence demonstrated that Jaynes knew that all of the more than 50,000 recipients of his unsolicited e-mails were subscribers to AOL, in part, because the e-mail addresses of all recipients ended in \"@aol. com\" and came from discs stolen from AOL.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Jaynes' e-mails advertised one of three products: (1) a FedEx refund claims product, (2) a \"Penny Stock Picker,\" and (3) a \"History Eraser\" product.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   To purchase one of these products, potential buyers would click on a hyperlink within the e-mail, which redirected them outside the e-mail, where they could consummate the purchase. Jaynes operated his enterprise through several companies which were not registered to do business in North Carolina, and evidence was introduced as to billing and payment activities for these companies, including evidence that registration fees were paid to AOL with credit cards held by fictitious account holders.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   While executing a search of Jaynes' home, police discovered a cache of compact discs (CDs) containing over 176 million full e-mail addresses and 1.3 billion e-mail user names. The search also led to the confiscation of a storage disc which contained AOL e-mail address information and other personal and private account information for millions of AOL subscribers. Police also discovered multiple storage discs which contained 107 million AOL e-mail addresses. Richard Rubenstein, manager of technical security investigations at AOL, testified that the discs recovered at Jaynes' home \"contained proprietary information\" of \"pretty near all\" AOL account customers.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   The AOL user information had been stolen from AOL by a former employee and was in Jaynes' possession.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Dr. John Levine, a consultant and author, testified as an expert witness and explained that the e-mails sent by Jaynes were not consistent with solicited bulk e-mail, but rather constituted unsolicited bulk e-mail (sometimes referred to as \"spam\" e-mail) because Jaynes had disguised the true sender and header information and used multiple addresses to send the e-mails. He explained:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   [H]ere the [e-mail] has been spread around nearly a thousand addresses. Where it's reasonable that you might use maybe a dozen addresses if you have a really big system and you're sending it from a dozen computers, I can't think of a valid reason why you would need to spread your e-mail over a thousand different addresses unless, again, you're trying to disguise the source.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The fact - both the fact that the domains do not seem plausible, they don't seem familiar, and the fact that it's spread out in a way that seems intended to disguise the origin of the mail, is what tells me this is not solicited e-mail.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   AOL, which houses all of its e-mail servers in Virginia, was directly affected by Jaynes' spam e-mail attack.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Brian Sullivan, the senior technical director for mail operations at, AOL, testified that bulk e-mail \"tends to create a lot of confusion\" for AOL customers and that AOL receives \"7 to 10 million complaints per day\" regarding spam e-mails. Sullivan also described the impact of spam emails, explaining that \"[i]f someone's mailbox is full because they got a truckload of spam and there's no more room, a message coming from Grandma is returned back to the sender. We can't take it at that point,\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   A jury convicted Jaynes of three counts of violating Code \u00a7 18.2-152.3:1, and the circuit court sentenced Jaynes to three years in prison on each count, with the sentences to run consecutively for an active term of imprisonment of nine years. The Court of Appeals affirmed his convictions,\n   <em>\n    Jaynes v.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3477936\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/va-app/48/673/\">\n    48 Va.App. 673\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3477936\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/va-app/48/673/\">\n    634 S.E.2d 357\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2006). We awarded Jaynes an appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   IL ANALYSIS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Jaynes makes four distinct assignments of error to the judgment of the Court of Appeals. First, he assigns error to the determination that the circuit court had jurisdiction over him on the crimes charged. Second, Jaynes contends Code \u00a7 18.2-152.3:1 \"abridgers] the First Amendment right to anonymous speech,\" and it was error not to reverse his convictions on that basis. Separately, Jaynes assigns as error the failure of the Court of Appeals to hold that Code \u00a7 18.2-152.3:1 is void for vagueness. Lastly, Jaynes' posits that the statute violates the Commerce Clause of the United States Constitution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   A. Jurisdiction\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Jaynes asserts that the Court of Appeals erred in holding that the circuit court had jurisdiction over him for violating Code \u00a7 18.2-152.3:1 because he did not \"use\" a computer in Virginia. He contends that a violation of that statute can occur only in the location where the e-mail routing information is falsified. Jaynes maintains that because he only used computers to send the e-mails from his home in Raleigh, North Carolina, he committed no crime in Virginia. Further, because he had no control over the routing of the e-mails, he argues his actions did not have an \"immediate result\" in Virginia, and under\n   <em>\n    Moreno v. Baskerville,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2092312\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/va/249/16/\">\n    249 Va. 16\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=452%20S.E.2d%20653\">\n    452 S.E.2d 653\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1995), could not be the basis for jurisdiction over him by Virginia courts. Therefore, according to Jaynes, the circuit court had no jurisdiction over him and his convictions are void.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   To successfully prosecute a crime under Code \u00a7 18.2-152.3:1(B), the Commonwealth must establish all the elements of that crime. In addition to the element of transmission volume within a specific time period, the Commonwealth must prove the sender used a computer and that such use was with the intent of falsifying routing information. The Commonwealth must also prove that the transmission of such false routing information occurred in connection with the use of an e-mail provider's computer network for that transmission. Thus, the crime is not complete until there is e-mail transmission passing through or into the computer, network of the e-mail provider or subscriber containing the false routing information.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Jaynes argues that he \"merely sent emails that happened to be routed through AOL servers.\" We disagree. As the evidence established, all e-mail must flow through the recipient's e-mail server in order to reach the intended recipient. By selecting AOL subscribers as his e-mail recipients, Jaynes knew and intended that his e-mails would utilize AOL servers because he clearly intended to send to users whose e-mails ended in \"@aol.com.\" The evidence established that the AOL servers are located in Virginia, and that the location of AOL's servers was information easily accessible to the general public. Applying our standard of review to the evidence presented along with all reasonable inferences therefrom, we conclude that the evidence supports the conclusion that Jaynes knew and intended that the e-mails he sent to AOL subscribers would utilize AOL's servers which are located in Virginia. Thus an intended and necessary result of Jaynes' action, the e-mail transmission through the computer network, occurred in Virginia.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Furthermore, a state may exercise jurisdiction over criminal acts that are committed outside the state, but are intended to, and do in fact, produce harm within the state. \"`It has long been a commonplace of criminal liability that a person may be charged in the place where the evil results, though he is beyond the jurisdiction when he starts the train of events of which the evil is the fruit.'\"\n   <em>\n    Travelers Health Ass'n v.

In.\n   <em>\n    Moreno,\n   </em>\n   the defendant, while in Arizona, arranged for delivery of drugs to an accomplice in Arizona who, in turn, delivered the drugs to two\n   other accomplices who ultimately sold the drugs in Virginia.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2092312\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/va/249/16/\">\n    249 Va. at 17-48\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=452%20S.E.2d%20653\">\n    452 S.E.2d, at 654\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Such routing, Jaynes contends, is the same type of intervention which occurred in\n   <em>\n    Moreno.\n   </em>\n   Therefore, according to Jaynes, the intervention of intermediate e-mail routers and servers prior to arrival of the e-mails at the AOL servers shows that the alleged harm through the AOL, servers in Virginia was not the \"immediate result\" of Jaynes' actions in North Carolina.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Jaynes' reliance on\n   <em>\n    Moreno\n   </em>\n   fails because, as noted above, Jaynes' affirmative act of selecting AOL subscribers as recipients of his e-mails insured the use of AOL's computer network to deliver the e-mails and such use was the \"immediate result\" of Jaynes' action, regardless of any intermediate routes taken by the e-mails. Because the use of the computer network of an e-mail service provider or its subscribers is an integral part of the crime charged and because the use of AOL's e-mail servers was the \"immediate result\" of Jaynes' acts, we hold that Jaynes was amenable to prosecution in Virginia for a violation of Code \u00a7 18.2,152.1:3. Accordingly, the circuit court had jurisdiction over Jaynes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   B. First Amendment Standing\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Jaynes next contends that Code \u00a7 18.2-152.3:1 is constitutionally deficient as over-broad under the First Amendment and therefore the statute cannot be enforced. He argues the Court of Appeals erred in affirming the circuit court's judgment which did not grant his motion to dismiss. Jaynes contends that under First Amendment jurisprudence, he has standing to raise the First Amendment claims of third parties and use those claims to defend his unrelated case. The Commonwealth initially responds that Jaynes lacks standing to raise a First Amendment challenge to the statute and therefore the First Amendment issues raised by Jaynes should not be addressed. The opinion of the Court of Appeals did not address the issue of standing as it decided the First Amendment claim on the merits. Because we hold the standing issue is dispositive, we do not address the analysis of the Court of Appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Jaynes does not contest that he transmitted the tens of thousands of e-mails containing false and misleading sender information in contravention of Code \u00a7 18.2-152.3:1. He does not deny that act occurred, in fact, on several occasions, each of which was in direct violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-152.3:1(B).\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Further, Jaynes does not contest that the bulk e-mails were an attempt by him to sell commercial products for his pecuniary gain and constitute, in this case, unprotected commercial speech for First Amendment purposes. In other words, he does not dispute the emails have no First Amendment protection in their own right, and that the statute is not unconstitutional as applied to him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Neither does Jaynes make a pure facial challenge to the statute alleging \"that no set of circumstances exists under which the Act would be valid.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v. Salerno,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6222105\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/481/739/#p745\">\n    481 U.S. 739\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 745,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6222105\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/481/739/#p745\">\n    107 S.Ct. 2095\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6222105,1148012\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/l-ed-2d/95/697/\">\n    95 L.Ed.2d 697\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1987). Instead, in First Amendment parlance, Jaynes challenges the statute by claiming unconstitutional over-breadth.\n   <em>\n    See Virginia v. Hicks,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8897431\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/539/113/#p118\">\n    539 U.S. 113\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 118-19,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8897431\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/539/113/#p118\">\n    123 S.Ct. 2191\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8897431\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/539/113/#p118\">\n    156 L.Ed.2d 148\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2003).\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   That is, Jaynes contends that because\n   the statute could potentially reach the protected speech of a third party, a hypothetical person neither charged with a crime nor before this Court, he (Jaynes) is entitled to claim exoneration for his unprotected commercial speech because Code \u00a7 18.2-152.3:1 could encompass an unknown individual's potentially protected speech. This concept of the invalidity of a criminal statute as overbroad under the First Amendment is Jaynes' basis to assert he has standing to contest an otherwise valid conviction for admitted criminal conduct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   If Jaynes' claim of overbreadth invalidity were brought under nearly any other constitutional basis than the First Amendment, it is clear he would have no standing to assert the claims of others.\n   <em>\n    See Members of City Council v.

As noted earlier, Jaynes makes no claim that his' commercial speech, on its `own merits, is entitled to any First Amendment protection. Just as clearly, it is self-evident that Jaynes' e-mails are misleading because each contained intentionally false and inaccurate routing and header information intended to shield Jaynes from accountability for his sales schemes. Jaynes does not contest the e-mail routing and header information was false. Thus, Jaynes' commercial speech would fail the initial requirement for First Amendment review under\n   <em>\n    Central Hudson Gas\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Fox\n   </em>\n   because it is \"misleading\" on its face.

An e-mail that passes through Virginia cannot be a \"wholly extraterritorial\" transaction. Nevertheless, the sender of an e-mail cannot insure that the e-mail will not at some point pass through Virginia. This factual reality of e-mail transmission has the potential of burdening interstate commerce because e-mail senders may have a heightened concern of possible criminal prosecution if their e-mails were routed through Virginia without their direction or knowledge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   To determine if this burden invalidates the statute, we apply the balancing test recited in\n   <em>\n    Pike v. Bruce Church, Inc.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12050581\" index=\"164\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/397/137/#p142\">\n    397 U.S. 137\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 142,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12050581\" index=\"165\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/397/137/#p142\">\n    90 S.Ct. 844\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12050581\" index=\"166\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/397/137/#p142\">\n    25 L.Ed.2d 174\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1970): \"[w]here the statute regulates evenhandedly to effectuate a legitimate local public interest, and its effects on interstate commerce are only incidental, it will be upheld unless the burden imposed on such commerce is clearly excessive in relation to the putative local benefits.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   In this case, the legitimate local public interest in preventing the proliferation of falsified unsolicited bulk e-mail, or \"spam\", is well documented. The Federal Government and many states have adopted anti-spam statutes.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   Arminda B. Bepko,\n   <em>\n    Note: A State-By-State Comparison of SPAM Laws,\n   </em>\n   13 Media L. &amp; Pol'y 20 (2004).

Furthermore, Congress has specifically allowed the states to regulate spam that \"involves \"falsity or deception in any portion of a commercial electronic mail message or information attached thereto.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"168\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%207707\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 7707\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b). As noted earlier, Jaynes' e-mails were unquestionably commercial and contained false routing and header information. It is clear that the Commonwealth has a strong local interest in, and gains local benefits from, regulating the type of e-mail proscribed by Code \u00a7 18.2-152.3:1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   By contrast, the effects of this statute on interstate commerce are incidental and do not impose an undue burden. Whatever burden there may be is the same for a Virginia or a non-Virginia unsolicited bulk e-mail sender. The only burden placed on the email sender is that the e-mail not contain false or forged transmission information. In the realm of legitimate commercial transactions, true identification of the market participant would seem to be the norm, not the transmission of e-mails with false identification. In comparing the obvious local benefit with the minimal burden on in-state or out-of-state commerce, both the Court of Appeals and the circuit court cited oft-quoted commentators:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   Even assuming that the antispam laws do not significantly further the state's interest, it is hard to see how the antispam laws burden interstate commerce at all. The spam laws essentially require truthfulness in the header, return address, and subject line of the e-mail, Far from burdening commerce, the truthfulness requirement facilitates it by eliminating fraud and deception. Compliance with the various antispam statutes is easy compared to noncompliance, which requires the spammer to incur costs of forging, re-mailing, and the like.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   Jack L.

However, I cannot join the majority's decision that Jaynes does not have standing to raise a First Amendment claim that Code \u00a7' 18.2-152.3:1 is unconstitutionally overbroad. As discussed below, I firmly believe that the policy reflected in other cases of this Court and virtually all other state and federal courts allowing litigants under very limited circumstances to raise constitutional challenges to statutes alleged to unconstitutionally burden the First Amendment right of free speech of third parties is the correct policy. Furthermore,\n   by rejecting this exception to the standing rule, the majority sends those litigants who raise an overbreadth challenge to statutes of this Commonwealth to the federal judicial system to construe such Virginia statutes and determine whether they are constitutional. I believe that the courts of this Commonwealth, not the federal courts, have the primary responsibility to consider and construe the statutes of this Commonwealth.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   A.\n   <em>\n    Standing\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   The majority opinion clearly and correctly recites that, as a general rule, a litigant has standing to sue only to vindicate those rights possessed by the litigant. The reasons for this standing requirement reflect important policy considerations including the principle that courts should not issue advisory opinions on factual situations not before it.\n   <em>\n    See e.g., Commonwealth v. Harley,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"697367\" index=\"170\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/va/256/216/#p219\">\n    256 Va. 216\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 219-20,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"171\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=504%20S.E.2d%20852\">\n    504 S.E.2d 852\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 854 (1998) (courts not constituted to render advisory opinions). The majority also identifies a limited exception to this rule that is made in one isolated but significant area. The exception allows a litigant to challenge a statute as overbroad in violation of rights protected by the First Amendment to the United States Constitution even if the challenger engaged in activity that is not entitled to constitutional protection. The United States Supreme Court has often expressed the reason for allowing this exception:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   This \"exception to the usual rules governing standing,\"\n   <em>\n    Dombrowski v.

We give a defendant standing to challenge a statute on grounds that it is facially overbroad, regardless of whether his own conduct could be regulated by a more narrowly drawn statute, because of the \"danger of tolerating, in the area of First Amendment freedoms, the existence of a penal statute susceptible of sweeping and improper application.\"\n   <em>\n    NAACP v.

Furthermore, although the defendant restaurant companies asserted that topless dancing was a form of speech, the Court did not treat the activity as speech but only commercial conduct, stating that \"[n]o evidence was presented which establishes that we are dealing with more than mere conduct, which is a fit subject of regulation under the police power, as opposed to a mixture of conduct and speech.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 236,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"216\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=208%20S.E.2d%2051\">\n    208 S.E.2d at 55\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

But such changes, in my opinion, should be made only after studied consideration of competing policies and the implications of the proposed change.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-143\">\n   The primary reason for the new standing policy, as expressed by the majority, is its belief that a litigant who engages in \"unprotected\" commercial speech should not be able to secure a \"get out of jail free\" card. While this may be an admirable policy as it relates to the litigant, there is no indication that the majority weighed its rationale or new policy against the danger or harm to society imposed by the overbroad statute. Thus, I can only surmise that the majority found those societal dangers of less importance and concluded that federal courts are a better or an acceptable venue for construing the constitutionality of Virginia statutes challenged on the basis of overbreadth.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-144\">\n   Furthermore, although the majority seems to deny standing to only one class of litigants - purveyors of deceptive commercial speech - this decision will, in my opinion, result in the complete eradication of the standing exception. Indeed, the majority specifically defines the defendant's activity as\n   <em>\n    unprotected\n   </em>\n   speech.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Indeed, by definition, the exception to the standing rule is only needed because the challenger seeking to raise the First Amendment rights of third parties is\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   engaged in protected speech or conduct. In all the cases of this Court, which the majority considers of no precedential value or irrelevant to the instant case because they did not involve commercial activity, the litigant was involved in unprotected activity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-145\">\n   Because the rationale for the standing exception requires that one engaged in unprotected speech be allowed to raise the rights of those engaged in protected speech, I can find no principled basis for discriminating between the types of unprotected activity for purposes of applying the standing exception. Indeed, in light of the Court's decision today, it is difficult to imagine how this Court could,\n   in the future, find a rational basis to allow a litigant engaged in unprotected speech or conduct to challenge a statute as unconstitutionally overbroad utilizing the standing exception. I can imagine no persuasive rationale for a policy that suggests a litigant engaged in unprotected commercial speech cannot qualify for the standing exception because that individual should not receive a \"get out of jail free\" card, but that a litigant engaging in any other unprotected activity could qualify for the exception. Consequently, although the majority may believe today's decision affects a limited number of defendants, in my opinion, the rationale underlying the majority's new classification will effectively eliminate the exception to the standing rule in all cases. As a result of this decision, those who wish to distribute their political views anonymously via the Internet must do so do under the threat of criminal prosecution and those who seek to challenge this statute or similar constitutionally suspect statutes must turn to the federal courts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-146\">\n   Because I would continue this Court's prior policy of recognizing the exception to the standing rule, I would allow Jaynes to pursue his First Amendment claim that Code \u00a7 18.2-152.3:1 is overbroad. In considering Jaynes' First Amendment challenge, I con elude for the following reasons that the statute is unconstitutionally overbroad and therefore would reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals and dismiss the charges against Jaynes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-147\">\n   B.\n   <em>\n    Constitutionality of Code \u00a7 18.2-152.3:1\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-148\">\n   As shown by the record, because e-mail transmission protocol requires entry of an IP address and domain name for the sender, the only way such a speaker can publish an anonymous e-mail is to enter a false IP address or domain name.

The concept of substantial overbreadth is not a test of the constitutionality of a statute, but a policy related to the remedy flowing from a successful facial challenge. A successful facial overbreadth challenge precludes the application of that statute in all circumstances. Recognizing the sweep of this remedy, the United States Supreme Court has stated that it will not impose such an expansive remedy where the chilling effect of an overbroad statute on constitutionally protected rights cannot justify prohibiting all enforcement of the law. \"For there are substantial social costs created by the overbreadth doctrine when it blocks application of a law to constitutionally unprotected speech. . . .\"\n   <em>\n    Virginia v.

It only prohibits the intentional use of false routing information in connection with sending certain e-mail through such servers. Thus, even if an e-mail service provider specifically allowed persons using false IP addresses and domain names to use its server, the sender could be prosecuted under the statute although there was no unauthorized , use or trespass. Therefore, Code \u00a7 18.2-152.3:1 is not a trespass statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-163\">\n   The Commonwealth's argument that there is no First Amendment right to use false identification to gain access to private property is inapposite. First, in making this argument the Commonwealth uses the terms \"false\" and \"fraudulent\" interchangeably. Those concepts are not synonymous.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   At issue here is the statute's prohibition of \"false\" routing information.

In litigation between these private parties, the courts have held that the unauthorized use of the Internet service providers' property constituted common law trespass and that a First Amendment claim could not be raised against the owner of private property.
