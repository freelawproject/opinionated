KINSER.\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In each of these appeals, the defendant claims that the admission into evidence, pursuant to Code \u00a7 19.2-187, of a certificate of analysis in the absence of testimony at trial from the person who performed the particular analysis and prepared the certificate yiolated his rights under the Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment. Because the procedure provided in Code \u00a7 19.2-187.1 adequately protects a criminal defendant's rights under the Confrontation Clause and because the defendants in these appeals failed to utilize that procedure, we conclude that they waived the challenges under the Confrontation Clause to the admissibility of the certificates of analysis. We will therefore affirm the judgments of the Court of Appeals upholding the various convictions at issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   I. RELEVANT FACTS AND PROCEEDINGS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Although these appeals involve a common dispositive question of law, which we review de novo,\n   <em>\n    Torloni v.

Therefore, we will first summarize the relevant facts of each case and then analyze the dispositive issue that the appeals share. The appeal by Mark A. Briscoe involves one additional issue that we will address separately following the analysis of the dispositive issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   A.\n   <em>\n    Magruder v. Commonwealth\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   During a consensual search of Michael Ricardo Magruder, Officer William Catlett of the City of Winchester Police Department discovered an \"off-white rock-like substance\" in the right front pocket of Magruder's pants. Catlett suspected the substance was' crack cocaine. Catlett took possession of the \"rock\" and submitted it to a forensic laboratory for testing. A forensic analyst with the Department of Criminal Justice Services, Division of Forensic Science, tested the substance and reported in a certificate of analysis that it was \"0.022 gram[s]\" of cocaine. In the certificate, the analyst also attested that he had performed the analysis and that the certificate was \"an accurate record of the results of that analysis.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Magruder was subsequently indicted in the Circuit Court of the City of Winchester for possession of cocaine, in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-250(A). At a bench trial, the Commonwealth offered into evidence the certificate of analysis. Relying on the decision in\n   <em>\n    Crawford v. Washington,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5873383\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/541/36/\">\n    541 U.S. 36\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5873383\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/541/36/\">\n    124 S.Ct. 1354\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5873383\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/541/36/\">\n    158 L.Ed.2d 177\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2004), Magruder objected, asserting that the admission of the certificate of analysis would violate his Sixth Amendment right to confront the witness against him. The circuit court overruled Magruder's objection, stating: \"\n   <em>\n    Crawford\n   </em>\n   only applies to testimonial evidence. You have a right to call [the forensic analyst] if you want to.\" Magruder did not call the forensic analyst to testify and presented no evidence refuting the accuracy of the analysis of the substance seized from him, as reported in the certificate of analysis. The circuit court convicted Magruder of possession of cocaine and sentenced him to a suspended term of one year and six months of incarceration, with two years of supervised probation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The Court of Appeals affirmed Magruder's conviction in an unpublished opinion.\n   <em>\n    Magruder v.

Thus, the Court of Appeals concluded that the circuit court did not err in admitting the certificate of analysis in the absence of testimony from the person who performed the analysis.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3070413\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/va-app/49/155/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On appeal to this Court, Magruder presents two assignments of error:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   I. The Court of Appeals erred in concluding that Code \u00a7 19.2-187.1 sets out\n   a reasonable procedure to be followed in order for a defendant to exercise his right to confront a particular limited class of scientific witnesses at trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   II. The Court of Appeals erred in concluding that a defendant's failure to timely notify the Commonwealth of his desire to confront the forensic analyst at trial constitutes a waiver of that right.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   B.\n   <em>\n    Cypress v. Commonwealth\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Sheldon A. Cypress was a passenger in an automobile being driven by his cousin when a trooper with the Virginia State Police stopped the vehicle because of its improperly tinted windows. The driver consented to a search of the vehicle. During that search, the trooper found, among other things, two plastic bags - one under the driver's seat and one under the passenger's seat - each containing a \"chunky white substance\" that the trooper suspected was crack cocaine. Subsequent forensic testing at the Department of Forensic Science revealed that the substance was cocaine, totaling 60.5 grams. A certificate of analysis reporting those results bore the signature of the forensic analyst who conducted the testing and included an attestation that she had performed the analysis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Cypress was indicted in the Circuit Court of the City of Chesapeake for possession of cocaine with the intent to distribute, having previously committed the offense of distribution or possession with the intent to distribute, in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-248(C). At a bench trial, the Commonwealth moved to admit the certificate of analysis into evidence. Cypress objected, arguing that under the holding in\n   <em>\n    Crawford\n   </em>\n   the certificate fell into a core class of testimonial evidence and was therefore inadmissible in the absence of testimony from the person who performed the analysis of the seized substance. The circuit court overruled the objection, holding that \"the scientific results stated in the certificate of analysis are not testimonial statements as that term is defined or described in\n   <em>\n    Crawford v. Washington.\n   </em>\n   \"\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Cypress did not call the forensic analyst as a witness and presented no evidence. The circuit court convicted Cypress of possession of cocaine with the intent to distribute, second or subsequent offense, and sentenced him to imprisonment for 15 years, with 10 years suspended, and a fine of $1,000.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The Court of Appeals denied Cypress' appeal in an unpublished per curiam order.\n   <em>\n    Cypress v. Commonwealth,\n   </em>\n   Record No. 1547-06-1 (January 3, 2007). Citing its decision in\n   <em>\n    Brooks,\n   </em>\n   the Court of Appeals stated: \"assuming a certificate of analysis constitutes testimonial evidence under\n   <em>\n    Crawford,\n   </em>\n   a defendant's confrontation rights are nonetheless protected by the procedures provided by Code \u00a7\u00a7 19.2-187 and 19.2-187.1.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3070413\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/va-app/49/155/\">\n     Id.,\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   slip op. at 2. The Court of Appeals, however, held that Cypress waived his right to confront the forensic analyst who prepared the certificate of analysis because he did not utilize the procedure set forth in Code \u00a7 19.2-487.1.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3070413\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/va-app/49/155/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   For the reasons stated in the January 3, 2007 order, a three-judge panel of the Court of Appeals also denied the petition for appeal.\n   <em>\n    Cypress v. Commonwealth,\n   </em>\n   Record No. 1547-06-1 (March 23, 2007).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Now on appeal to this Court, Cypress raises two assignments of error:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   I. The trial court erred by allowing into evidence the certificate of analysis over Defendant's objection that its introduction violated his Sixth Amendment Confrontation Clause rights as articulated in\n   <em>\n    Crawford v. Washington\n   </em>\n   and its progeny; the trial court erred by finding Cypress guilty of possession with intent to distribute cocaine where the only evidence that he possessed cocaine came from this drug certificate\n   which should have been excluded from evidence[.]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   II. The Court of Appeals erred by ruling that Defendant waived his Confrontation Clause rights by declining to subpoena the chemist who prepared the certificate and this ruling impermissibly, and unconstitutionally, required Defendant to take affirmative steps to safeguard his Confrontation Clause rights[.]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   C.\n   <em>\n    Briscoe v. Commonwealth\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Police officers with the City of Alexandria Police Department executed a search warrant for the apartment of Mark A. Briscoe. During the search, the officers seized suspected cocaine scattered about in the apartment's kitchen area, as well as two scales, a razor blade, a 100-gram weight, a box of plastic sandwich bags, and a plate. Many of these items appeared to have deposits of drug residue on them. In a search of Briscoe's person, the police seized a white, rocklike substance wrapped in plastic from the pocket of his shorts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The police submitted the items of suspected cocaine to the Department of Criminal Justice Services, Division of Forensic Science, for testing. In two certificates of analysis, a forensic analyst reported that the confiscated substances were \"solid material\" cocaine totaling 36.578 grams. The certificates also contained the analyst's signature and attestation that she performed the analyses and that the certificates accurately reflected the results of those analyses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Briscoe was indicted in the Circuit Court of, the City of Alexandria for possession with the intent to distribute cocaine, in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-248(C), unlawful transportation of cocaine into the Commonwealth with the intent to distribute, in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-248.01, and conspiracy to distribute cocaine, in violation of Code \u00a7\u00a7 18.2-248 and 18.2-256. During a bench trial, the Commonwealth sought to admit into evidence the two certificates of analysis. Briscoe objected, arguing that their admission, without the forensic analyst present to testify, violated his confrontation rights under the Sixth Amendment. Relying on the decision in\n   <em>\n    Crawford,\n   </em>\n   Briscoe asserted that the certificates were testimonial because they contained solemn declarations or affirmations that the Commonwealth sought to use in order to establish an element of the charged offenses. Briscoe also claimed that the procedure provided in Code \u00a7 19.2-187.1 permitting a defendant to call a forensic analyst as an adverse witness does not protect his confrontation rights and actually imposes an unconstitutional affirmative step that he must take in order to assert his Sixth Amendment right of confrontation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The circuit court overruled Briscoe's objection, holding that the procedure in Code \u00a7 19.2-187.1 preserved his right to cross-examine the forensic analyst. In response to the circuit court's ruling, Briscoe further argued that the statutory right to call the forensic analyst as an adverse witness does not satisfy his constitutional right to confront the Commonwealth's witness and also impermissibly shifts the burden to produce evidence to a criminal defendant. The circuit court did not change its ruling.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Briscoe did not call the forensic analyst to testify and presented no evidence. The circuit court convicted Briscoe of possession with the intent to distribute cocaine and transportation of cocaine into the Commonwealth with the intent to distribute. The court sentenced Briscoe to a total of 20 years of incarceration, with all but 5 years and 8 months suspended.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The Court of Appeals denied Briscoe's appeal in an unpublished per curiam order.\n   <em>\n    Briscoe v. Commonwealth,\n   </em>\n   Record No. 1478-06-4 (January 18, 2007). Assuming, without deciding, that the certificates of analysis constituted \"testimonial\" evidence under\n   <em>\n    Crawford,\n   </em>\n   the Court of Appeals held that Briscoe's right to confront the forensic analyst was protected by the procedure provided in Code \u00a7 19,2-187.1.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3070413\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/va-app/49/155/\">\n     Id.,\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   slip op. at 2 (citing\n   <em>\n    Brooks,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3070413\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/va-app/49/155/\">\n    49 Va.App. at 161\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3070413\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/va-app/49/155/\">\n    638 S.E.2d at 134\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ).

The Court of Appeals erred in upholding the trial court's finding that Defendant's constitutional right to confront and cross-examine adverse witnesses was not violated by the admission of the certificates of drug analysis into evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   II. ANALYSIS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   A.\n   <em>\n    Confrontation Clause\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The dispositive issue before us is whether the procedure set forth in Code \u00a7 19.2-187.1 adequately protects a criminal, defendant's rights under the Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment, and if so, whether Magruder, Cypress, and Briscoe (collectively, the defendants) waived their Confrontation Clause challenges to the admissibility of the respective certificates of analysis by failing to utilize that procedure. Before resolving that issue, we first turn to the decision of the Supreme Court of the United States in\n   <em>\n    Crawford v. Washington,\n   </em>\n   since the defendants relied on it in claiming that admission into evidence of the certificates of analysis violated their confrontation rights. Prior to that decision, the Confrontation Clause had not been construed to bar the admission of an unavailable witness' hearsay statement against a criminal defendant if the statement bore sufficient \"indicia of reliability\" either by falling within a \"firmly rooted hearsay exception\" or by \"a showing of particularized guarantees of trustwor thiness.\"\n   <em>\n    Ohio v. Roberts,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1787607\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/448/56/#p66\">\n    448 U.S. 56\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 66,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1787607\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/448/56/#p66\">\n    100 S.Ct. 2531\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1787607\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/448/56/#p66\">\n    65 L.Ed.2d 597\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1980). In\n   <em>\n    Crawford,\n   </em>\n   the Supreme Court rejected the\n   <em>\n    Roberts\n   </em>\n   analysis and held that \"[w]here testimonial evidence is at issue, ... the Sixth Amendment demands what the common law required: unavailability [of the witness] and a prior opportunity for cross-examination.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5873383\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/541/36/\">\n    541 U.S. at 68\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5873383\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/541/36/\">\n    124 S.Ct. 1354\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    accord Hodges v.

Pursuant to Code \u00a7 19.2-187, a \"duly attested\" certificate of analysis that has been timely filed with the appropriate clerk of court is \"admissible in evidence as evidence of the facts therein stated and the results of the analysis or examination referred to therein.\" The provisions of Code \u00a7 19.2-187.1 then inform a criminal defendant about what steps to take in order to secure the physical presence of the forensic analyst and subject that person to an oath, cross-examination, and a credibility determination by the trier of fact-the elements of confrontation. Once the forensic analyst appears at trial for cross-examination, any Confrontation Clause problem disappears.\n   <em>\n    See Crawford,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5873383\" index=\"184\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/541/36/\">\n    541 U.S. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   59 n. 9,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5873383\" index=\"185\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/541/36/\">\n    124 S.Ct. 1354\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[W]hen the declarant appears for cross-examination at trial, the Confrontation Clause places no constraints at all on the use of his prior testimonial statements.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Based on the provisions of Code \u00a7\u00a7 19.2-187 and 19.2-187.1, no criminal defendant can seriously contend that he is not on notice that a certificate of analysis will be admitted into evidence without testimony from the person who performed the analysis unless he utilizes the procedure provided in Code \u00a7 19.2-181.1. Failure to use the statutory procedure obviously waives the opportunity to confront the forensic analyst.

He stated that the cocaine found in the kitchen sink should have been about 40 grams and that he got it from \"[his] man in [Washington,] D.C. two weeks ago\" and brought it back to Alexandria.

When asked where he obtained cocaine, Briscoe named \"three main guys\" in Washington, D.C. as his sources. He also named five dealers to whom he sells the cocaine and explained the frequency of those sales and the profit he makes from the cocaine he buys. All of these statements were admitted into evidence during Briscoe's trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   We agree with the Court of Appeals' holding that \"[Briscoe's] confession that he brought the [cocaine] from D.C. to Alexandria, along with the evidence seized from his person and his apartment, sufficiently established the\n   <em>\n    corpus delicti\n   </em>\n   of the transportation offense.\"\n   <em>\n    Briscoe v.

No \"procedural step\" under Code \u00a7 19.2-187.1 will preserve a defendant's Sixth Amendment confrontation right, because that section merely establishes a separate, statutory right for a defendant to call the forensic scientist as a witness in a defendant's own case. Thus, Code \u00a7 19.2-187.1 does not impact a defendant's Sixth Amendment right \"to be confronted\" by the witnesses against him, because the statute cannot revive a defendant's right to be confronted by the prosecution with the scientist's evidence.\n   <em>\n    See Belvin,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8992016\" index=\"364\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/922/1046/#p1054\">\n    922 So.2d at 1054\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    State v.

We are not willing to engage in the sort of speculation urged by the defendants. Furthermore, the provisions of Code \u00a7 19.2-07 obviate the need for the Commonwealth to call one of the limited number of forensic analysts to testify in every case in which a certificate of analysis is being offered into evidence if the defendant chooses not to exercise his confrontation rights by utilizing the procedure provided in Code \u00a7 192-187.1.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"6.\">\n   <p id=\"p-93\">\n    In relevant part, the provisions of Code \u00a7 18.2-248.01 make it \"unlawful for any person to transport into the Commonwealth by any means with the intent to sell or distribute one ounce or more of cocaine, coca leaves or any salt, compound, derivative or preparation thereof.\"\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
