KINSER.\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   A jury convicted Germaine Delano Adams of the second-degree murder of Christopher Junior Hairston and the use of a firearm in the commission of a felony. The primary issue in this appeal concerns the good-faith exception to the exclusionary rule as set forth in\n   <em>\n    United States v. Leon,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11340969\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/468/897/\">\n    468 U.S. 897\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11340969\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/468/897/\">\n    104 S.Ct. 3405\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11340969\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/468/897/\">\n    82 L.Ed.2d 677\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1984), and whether it applies in this case. Because we conclude that a reasonably well trained police officer would not have known that a search of Adams' residence was illegal despite a magistrate's issuance of a search warrant, we will affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals of Virginia holding that the good-faith exception applies and that the trial court therefore did not err in admitting into evidence items seized during the search of Adams' residence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I. RELEVANT FACTS AND PROCEEDINGS\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In the early morning hours of June 18, 2004, James Vaught, a sergeant with the Henry County Sheriffs Office, responded to a call concerning a shooting at the Virginia Oaks Trailer Park. Upon arriving at the scene of the shooting, Vaught discovered the body of Hairston lying face down in the road to the trailer park. An autopsy of the body revealed that the cause of death was a gunshot wound to Hairston's neck. Vaught also discovered four shell casings near the body that were subsequently determined to have been fired from a 9mm Glock pistol.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Later that day, Scott Barker, an investigator with the Henry County Sheriffs Office, prepared and signed under oath a criminal complaint based on information received\n   from other police officers who had investigated the shooting. In the complaint, Barker stated:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   [T]he accused-Germaine Delano Adams shot the victim Christopher Junior Hairston in the neck which resulted in the death of the victim. The incident occurred at approximately 0137 hrs on Virginia Oaks Ct. in Henry County, Va. Just prior to the shooting Germaine Delano Adams and Christopher Junior Hairston were arguing over $20 that Christopher J. Hairston owed Germaine D. Adams.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The complaint also listed Adams' address as \"101 Va. Oaks Ct., Ridgeway, Va. 24148.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   About 19 minutes after executing the criminal complaint before a magistrate, Barker signed an affidavit for a search warrant before the same magistrate. In the affidavit, Barker stated that Hairston had received a fatal gunshot wound to his neck at approximately 1:37 a.m. on June 18, 2004, \"while he was on Virginia Oaks Ct.\" Barker further stated in the affidavit that \"[biased on witness statements, the victim Christopher Junior Hairston was in a[sic] arguement [sic] with Germaine Delano Adams at the time he was shot.\" Barker described the place to be searched by providing the following information:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Turn on to Virginia Oaks Ct. from Axton Rd.... The trailor [sic] to be searched will be the third trailor [sic] on the left on Virginia Oaks Ct. The residence is light grey [sic] with dark grey [sic] trim. The residence has a front wood stoop with three steps and two rails. The residence has a white front door and a satellite dish on the roof at the rear. There are no visible number markings on the residence. The residence has what appears to be a video camera on the outside.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Finally, Barker requested authorization to search for videotapes, digital recordings, audio recordings, weapons (including but not limited to a 9mm caliber weapon), ammunition, and \"any and all evidence relating to the murder of Christopher Junior Hairston.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Based on the information in the affidavit, a magistrate issued a search warrant for \"101 Virginia Oaks, Ridgeway, VA 24148,\" which the criminal complaint identified as Adams' address. The search warrant contained the same detailed information describing the place to be searched as that set forth in the affidavit and authorized a search for the items sought in the affidavit. The search warrant was executed about an hour after the magistrate issued it. The items seized during the search included a Hoppes pistol cleaning kit for various handguns including a 9mm pistol; an Uncle Mike's shoulder holster, size 15; an Uncle Mike's shoulder holster size 0; seven 9mm cartridges in a clear plastic boggle; a large gray Sentry safe; a Taurus handgun box; a Federal Hydra-shok ammunition box containing fifteen cartridges; and a packaging box for personal checks bearing the name of \"Germaine D. Adams.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Prior to his jury trial in the Circuit Court of Henry County, Adams filed a motion to suppress the evidence seized at his residence pursuant to the search warrant. He asserted that the affidavit for the search warrant lacked probable cause because it failed to establish a nexus between the residence to be searched and either Adams or the shooting incident. At the hearing on the motion to suppress, the Commonwealth conceded that the affidavit was \"lacking in probable cause.\" In fact, the Commonwealth admitted that \"[title only nexus, reading this [affidavit] in the most favorable light to the Commonwealth, is that Christopher. Junior Hairston was shot to death on Virginia Oaks Court in Henry County\" and \"we don't know from this [affidavit] whose residence\" was to be searched. The Commonwealth, however, relied on the good-faith exception to the exclusionary rule set forth in\n   <em>\n    Leon\n   </em>\n   and urged the trial court to deny the motion to suppress.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Initially, the trial court sustained the motion to suppress, deciding that the good-faith exception did not apply because the \"search warrant was based on an affidavit so lacking in indicia of probable cause as to render official belief in its existence as unreasonable.\" The court, however, subsequently granted the Commonwealth's motion to reconsider its ruling in light of the decision in\n   <em>\n    Anzualda v. Commonwealth,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"432982\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/va-app/44/764/\">\n    44 Va.App. 764\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"432982\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/va-app/44/764/\">\n    607 S.E.2d 749\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2005) (en banc).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Upon reconsideration, the trial court applied the good-faith exception because it found some indicia of probable cause in the affidavit for the search warrant. According to the trial court, \"[t]he officer acted reasonably in believing the warrant to be valid.\" The circuit court thus denied Adams' motion to suppress the evidence seized during the search of his residence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The Court of Appeals, in affirming the trial court's judgment denying the motion to suppress, held that \"a reasonable officer, acting in objective good faith, reviewing the facts presented under oath to the magistrate, could have believed the magistrate had probable cause to issue the search warrant for Adams' [ ] residence and that he could, therefore, rely on the warrant.\"\n   <em>\n    Adams v. Commonwealth,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3477476\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/va-app/48/737/#p749\">\n    48 Va.App. 737\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 749,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3477476\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/va-app/48/737/#p749\">\n    635 S.E.2d 20\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 26 (2006). The Court of Appeals concluded \"the officer relied in good faith on evidence before the magistrate, as indicated in the written facts sworn to under oath contained in the\n   <em>\n    complaint\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    affidavit.\n   </em>\n   \"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3477476\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/va-app/48/737/#p749\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3477476\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/va-app/48/737/#p749\">\n    at 750\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3477476\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/va-app/48/737/#p749\">\n    635 S.E.2d at 26\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   We awarded Adams this appeal. Adams challenges the holding of the Court of Appeals that the good-faith exception to the exclusionary rule applies in this case, its reliance on the criminal complaint in addition to the search warrant affidavit, and the fact that the Court of Appeals sua sponte considered the criminal complaint. Adams also challenges the Court of Appeals' additional holding that the admission of certain hearsay testimony concerning the contents of a gun and accessories catalogue was harmless error.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   II.

Because there are no facts in dispute with regard to the motion to suppress, the applicability of the\n   <em>\n    Leon\n   </em>\n   exception in this case is purely a legal determination.\n   <em>\n    See United States v.

Totality of the Circumstances\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Leon,\n   </em>\n   the Supreme Court of the United States limited the application of the exclusionary rule \"so as not to bar the admission of evidence seized in reasonable, good-faith reliance on a search warrant that is subsequently held to be defective.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11340969\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/468/897/\">\n    468 U.S. at 905\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11340969\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/468/897/\">\n    104 S.Ct. 3405\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Adams, however, argues that the Court of Appeals erred by relying on the criminal complaint in conjunction with the search warrant affidavit in making its good-faith\n   determination. In other words, Adams contends that the good-faith inquiry is limited to the sworn, written facts set forth in the four corners of the search warrant affidavit. We do not agree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The Supreme Court stated in\n   <em>\n    Leon\n   </em>\n   that its \"evaluation of the costs and benefits of suppressing reliable physical evidence seized by officers reasonably relying on a warrant issued by a detached and neutral magistrate leads to the conclusion that such evidence should be admissible in the prosecution's case in chief.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11340969\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/468/897/\">\n    468 U.S. at 913\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11340969\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/468/897/\">\n    104 S.Ct. 3405\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The purpose of the good-faith exception is, therefore, best accomplished by looking at the totality of the circumstances surrounding the issuance and execution of the search warrant.

To confine the good-faith analysis to the facts set forth in the four corners of the search warrant affidavit (even if the analysis also considers additional information presented to the magistrate) changes the focus of the inquiry from the objective good faith of a reasonably well-trained police officer to a magistrate's determination of probable cause. It also leads to the exclusion of competent evidence in the prosecution's case in chief even though reasonably well-trained police officers acted in objective good-faith reliance on a search warrant. This approach undermines the purposes of both the exclusionary rule and its good-faith exception.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   We thus conclude that the totality of the circumstances should be considered when deciding the question of good faith.

The specific focus of the issue, as it was presented in the trial court, is whether the affidavit supporting the search warrant in question was \"so lacking in indicia of probable cause as to render official belief in its existence entirely unreasonable,\" /d. at 923,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11340969\" index=\"156\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/468/897/\">\n    104 S.Ct. 3405\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In my view, when the analysis properly is restricted to the issue as it was presented in the trial court, the result of the majority's decision today permits the search of a private residence solely because a\n   crime allegedly occurred on the same street where the home was located. This result effectively strips the third component of the\n   <em>\n    Leon\n   </em>\n   good-faith exception of any substantive content, permitting the admission of evidence obtained from a search warrant that contains no indicia of probable cause.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   The facts of the case are undisputed and adequately recited in the majority opinion. Repetition of those facts here would unnecessarily add length to this dissent. Moreover, the parameters of the\n   <em>\n    Leon\n   </em>\n   good-faith exception and the application of the \"totality of the circumstances\" analysis of that exception are not my focus here. Indeed, if this case properly presented the issue of whether \"the officer relied in good faith on evidence before the magistrate, as indicated in the written facts sworn to under oath contained in the [criminal]\n   <em>\n    complaint\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    affidavit\n   </em>\n   [for the search warrant]\" as addressed sua sponte by the Court of Appeals,\n   <em>\n    Adams v. Commonwealth,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3477476\" index=\"157\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/va-app/48/737/#p749\">\n    48 Va.App. 737\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 750,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3477476\" index=\"158\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/va-app/48/737/#p749\">\n    635 S.E.2d 20\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 26 (2006) (emphasis added), and now by the majority here, we would have been presented with an entirely different case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   However, such is simply not the case presented in this appeal. During the suppression hearing, the Commonwealth did not present any evidence that the magistrate had considered the complaint in conjunction with the affidavit when determining probable cause to issue the search warrant. Nor did the Commonwealth ask the trial court to consider either the magistrate's or the officer's knowledge of the facts contained in the complaint in order to determine whether the officer' reliance on the warrant was reasonable. Clearly, the Commonwealth did not choose to argue that the criminal complaint was part of the \"totality of the circumstances\" the trial court should consider in undertaking the\n   <em>\n    Leon\n   </em>\n   good-faith analysis. In short, the majority has essentially decided a case that is not before this Court by considering an argument that was never made to the trial court,\n   <em>\n    cf. Jackson v.

However, an appellate court should not have to speculate what \"common sense\" might suggest when the record adequately demonstrates what evidence the trial court actually considered. In this case, the trial court clearly restricted its consideration of the affidavit in addressing the\n   <em>\n    Leon\n   </em>\n   good-faith issue presented by the Commonwealth's evidence and supporting assertions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   In short, it is my view that the Court of Appeals erred by relying sua sponte on the facts asserted in the criminal complaint to support its determination that the trial court did not err in finding that the\n   <em>\n    Leon\n   </em>\n   good-faith exception should apply in this case. By asserting the correctness of the Court of Appeals' decision in that regard, the Commonwealth now presents to this Court an argument that perhaps it ought to have presented in the trial court, but one which it failed to make there and in the Court of Appeals. By giving heed to that argument, the majority is deciding a case that is not supported by the trial record to which we should confine our review. That record restricts our consideration to the issue whether the trial court erred in finding that evidence obtained through a search warrant, defective on its face, was nonetheless admissible because\n   <em>\n    the affidavit supporting the search warrant\n   </em>\n   had sufficient indicia of probable cause to reasonably support the officer's belief in the warrant's validity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   When, as here, an officer executes a search warrant that is not supported by probable cause, the officer's reliance on that warrant\n   must be objectively reasonable for a court to conclude that the evidence seized is admissible because it was obtained in good faith.\n   <em>\n    Leon,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11340969\" index=\"167\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/468/897/\">\n    468 U.S. at 922\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11340969\" index=\"168\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/468/897/\">\n    104 S.Ct. 3405\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    Ward v.

As the Supreme Court stated in\n   <em>\n    Leon,\n   </em>\n   courts must \"eschew inquiries into the subjective beliefs of law enforcement officers who seize evidence pursuant to a subsequently invalidated warrant.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 923,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11340969\" index=\"189\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/468/897/\">\n    104 S.Ct. 3405\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also Ward,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"190\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=273%20Va.%20211\">\n    273 Va. at 224\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12637506\" index=\"191\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/se2d/639/269/#p272\">\n    639 S.E.2d at 275\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Under the majority's application of the\n   <em>\n    Leon\n   </em>\n   good-faith exception, however, officers would be permitted to act on supposition and subjective belief, using a warrant and affidavit lacking any stated nexus between a crime and a particular home to search that home merely because it is located near a crime scene.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   In my view, the present affidavit is no better than a prohibited \"bare bones\" affidavit because it fails to provide any factual basis establishing a nexus between the crime and the residence searched, and requires an officer to rely on unstated suspicions, beliefs, and conclusions to provide that missing nexus.\n   <em>\n    See United.

A consideration of the particular information missing from the present affidavit underscores this conclusion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   The affidavit does not allege that any particular individual committed, or was suspected of having committed, any crime. The affidavit also fails to state any connection between Adams and the residence described in the warrant. In addition, the affidavit fails to state any facts tending to show that a search of the residence would yield any items related to the crime that occurred at an unspecified location on the street. The fact that the residence was described as having what appeared to be a video camera affixed outside did not provide the required nexus, because the affidavit did not state that the shooting, or other activity related to the crime, occurred in front of the home or within a reasonable distance from the purported video camera.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   The only relationship established in the search warrant and affidavit between the crime and the home searched was the fact that Hairston was shot on the same street where the residence was located. Although the search ultimately revealed evidence suggesting that the home was Adams' residence, nothing in the warrant or the affidavit indicated that a search of that residence would yield any evidence relating to the crime. In the absence of any such facts in the affidavit linking Adams to the crime, or the crime to the described residence or its contents, the affidavit was \"so lacking in indicia of probable\n   cause as to render official belief in its existence entirely unreasonable.\"\n   <em>\n    Leon,\n   </em>\n   468 U.S. at 923,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11340969\" index=\"195\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/468/897/\">\n    104 S.Ct. 3405\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
