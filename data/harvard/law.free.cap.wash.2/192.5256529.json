The Iowa National Bank, having been so secured, began an action to foreclose the mortgage. Appellants Turner &amp; Jay, being judgment creditors, and not secured, sought to intervene in said suit. Their petition in intervention alleges that Lloyd &lt;&amp; Co. were indebted largely in excess of their ability to pay; that the mortgages aforesaid covered all of their property, and were all executed on the same day; and that the execution of such mortgages, under the circumstances, was in effect an assignment of their property for the benefit of the parties to whom the mortgages were made, and that it was fraudulent as to appellants. Appellants asked that the mortgage be adjudged void as to them, and the property held subject to execution for tbe satisfaction of their judgment. An execution had been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>issued thereon, and returned <em>nulla bona </em>prior to said intervention. The plaintiffs demurred to the petition on the ground that it did not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action. The court sustained the demurrer. There is no law in this state to prevent a debtor, even though he be in failing circumstances, from paying or securing a portion of his creditors, so long as he does so in good faith, although he should dispose of his entire property in that way, and leave other debts unsatisfied. It is not disputed that this mortgage, and also the others, were given for the purpose of securing <em>bona fide </em>debts. There is no reason in justice or equity why this particular mortgage should be held void, and the mortgagee deprived of its security, in order that the property may be made available to satisfy the claim of these intervening creditors. The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b222-6\">Anders, C. J., and Dunbar, Hoyt, and Stiles, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
