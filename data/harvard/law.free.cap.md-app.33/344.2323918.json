Raum, Assistant Attorney General, </em>with whom were <em>Francis B. Burch, Attorney General, Lawrence V. Kelly, State\u2019s Attorney for Allegany County, </em>and <em>Robert W.

He was found guilty on each count and received a three year sentence on each count, to be served consecutively. He seeks reversal of the judgments of conviction on three grounds. Because we shall reverse the judgments of conviction and remand the case for a new trial we need only consider two: 1) the sufficiency of the evidence, and 2) the propriety of the court\u2019s action in striking appellant\u2019s insanity plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-12\">\n<em>Sufficiency of the Evidence</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b379-13\">The evidence was clearly sufficient to support the convictions. Appellant\u2019s statements to a State Trooper that he did indeed steal the automobiles were received in evidence without objection. There was ample corroboration of the <em>corpus delicti.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b379-14\">\n<em>The Plea of Insanity</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b379-15\">The criminal information was filed on June 26, 1975. When appellant was arraigned on July 2,1975, he filed as his only plea the following written \u201cPlea of Insanity\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b379-16\">\u201cFor pleas to the informations [sic] in the above <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>cases [sic], the defendant, Harry E. Riggleman, pursuant to Article 59, <em>Section 23 </em>of the Annotated Code of Maryland, alleges that he was insane <em>at the time of the commission of the alleged crimes\u201d. </em>(Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b380-5\">On the same date, July 2, 1975, the court signed an order (obviously submitted by appellant\u2019s counsel) committing appellant \u201cto Springfield State Hospital. . . for the purpose of undergoing a complete psychiatric examination and evaluation by the medical staff of said hospital\u201d. It was further ordered \u201cthat a complete psychiatric report will be prepared by said medical staff from the basis of said examination and evaluation <em>in accordance with the provisions of Article 59, Section 23 of the Annotated Code of Maryland.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b380-6\">Under the judge\u2019s signature on the order appears this handwritten statement: \u201cThis man is a high security risk. Please take proper precautions to detain him\u201d. As the judge later remarked, \u201c. . . [N]o such precautions were apparently taken\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-7\">On November 5, 1975, the State filed a \u201cMotion for Appropriate Relief\u2019 asking the court to \u201cdismiss the Insanity plea\u201d or in the alternative to \u201cgrant that relief which the Court deems appropriate in the premises\u201d. The motion alleged the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b380-8\">\u201c1. On June 5, 1975, HARRY EDWARD RIGGLEMAN, SR., hereinafter referred to as Defendant, was arrested and charged with two counts of larceny of motor vehicle. On or about June 26, 1975, following a preliminary hearing, an information charging said offenses was filed in this Honorable Court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b380-10\">2. On July 2, 1975, the Defendant was arraigned <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>and entered pleas of insanity in these cases. On the same dates, the Court signed an order committing the Defendant to Springfield State Hospital for examination and report (the State Department of Health and Mental Hygiene having indicated the examination had to be conducted there). On <em>July 3, 1975, </em>the Defendant was transported to Springfield Hospital for psychiatric examination. On or about July 4, 1975, the Defendant escaped from the hospital. On August 16, 1975, the Defendant was returned to Springfield by a police officer. On August 18, 1975, the Defendant fled, having escaped for the second time. Due to the Defendant\u2019s having removed himself, no examination was conducted. On or about September 18, 1975, the Defendant was apprehended by Pennsylvania authorities and incarcerated in the Somerset County, Pennsylvania, Jail. The Defendant refused to waive extradition unless the State agreed to return him to Springfield State Hospital which the State declined to do, and was returned to this jurisdiction on October 14, 1975, following an extradition hearing in Pennsylvania.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b381-5\">3. The State has attempted, without success at this time, to arrange a psychiatric examination in Allegany County by a private psychiatrist who would be paid by the State.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b381-6\">4. At no time has the Defendant adduced any evidence which would provide a basis for an insanity plea. The State alleges the plea in this case is frivolous, being without any factual basis, and is pursued for the purpose of delay or further escape. This case has been scheduled for trial in this Honorable Court on November 14,1975.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b381-8\">WHEREFORE, your Petitioner prays the Court to conduct a hearing and grant the appropriate relief requested.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b381-9\">On November 5, 1975, a copy of the motion was served on appellant at the Allegany County jail and a copy mailed to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>his counsel. A hearing on the motion was held two days later on November 7. At the hearing, the State\u2019s Attorney recited to the court the allegations in the motion and announced that appellant\u2019s counsel had \u201cindicated that . . . the Defendant agrees ... to the chronology when he was taken to Springfield, when he left, when he returned and when he left again. The other matters that we allege . . . are matters of record with regard to the placing of the charges\u201d. He concluded his opening remarks by saying, \u201cI have no particular evidence that we would adduce at this time. We do have law that we would like to bring to the Court\u2019s attention\u201d. At this point, appellant\u2019s counsel said to the court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b382-5\">\u201cMR. SCHINDLER: If Your Honor please, the Defendant is still claiming and wants to maintain his plea of not guilty by reason of insanity. And my information from the Defendant at this time is that Dr. Franklin was supposed to have examined him yesterday. The date for the examination has been postponed until Monday.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b382-6\">BY THE COURT: Doctor who?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b382-7\">MR. SCHINDLER: Franklin. I would like to request Your Honor\u2019s permission .... I feel that I ought to have the Defendant on the witness stand and ask him some questions as to why he wants to maintain his plea of insanity and so forth. The Defense feels, counsel feels that we should be accorded the right to have the Defendant take the witness stand and answer various questions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b382-8\">BY THE COURT: All right.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b382-9\">In his testimony, appellant denied the allegation that he \u201crefused to waive extradition unless the State agreed to return him to Springfield\u201d, saying that he only \u201ctold them I would not come back to Maryland\u201d. He also testified that he had an appointment with Dr. Franklin on November 10; that Dr. Franklin, who he said was \u201can ear, nose and throat specialist\u201d, had told him that he had \u201can abcess down under the ear drum, the inner ear drum, that puts pressure on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>brain\u201d and that was why he filed his plea of insanity; that he had \u201cbeen in the hospital for blacking out spells\u201d; that he has had nine \u201cblackout spells\u201d since 1974; and that he escaped from Springfield because he \u201cwas more or less afraid that they would go cutting on me down there\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-5\">It appears that when appellant was returned to Maryland on October 14, 1975, following his second escape on August 18, 1975, he was not returned to Springfield State Hospital, but to the Allegany County jail. There is nothing in the record authorizing his transfer from the hospital to the jail. Presumably the State did not wish him to return to Springfield for fear he might again escape. The court asked the State\u2019s Attorney, \u201cWould it be feasible or possible to have the Defendant examined by a local psychiatrist in custody here, Mr. Kelly?\u201d Mr. Kelly (the State\u2019s Attorney for Allegany County) answered:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b383-6\">\u201cI might say with regard to that, Your Honor, that the State has been working for approximately two months, not generally with Mr. Riggleman\u2019s case, although this points out dramatically the failure in our whole \u2014 in the structure of things. That is, committing people to Springfield. We\u2019ve had I believe this year five individuals committed, of which four have escaped, Mr. Riggleman being one. I have attempted to do that. At this point we have no psychiatrists that will agree to that. I\u2019m hopeful that in the future, the immediate future hopefully, that we will be in such position.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b383-9\">But, frankly, Your Honor, we would in Mr. Riggleman\u2019s case rely simply on the fact that his case has been handled as cases since the beginning of time in Allegany County. And, frankly, while we\u2019re willing to change the system generally, I\u2019m not particularly willing to change the system to meet Mr. Riggleman\u2019s particular situation. And we would rely on the state of the case as it presently is. Although, frankly, we hope in a month or so to be in a position where we can conduct our own mental <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>examinations here in Allegany County rather than to rely on the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene. But at this time that simply isn\u2019t true, Your Honor.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b384-5\">At the conclusion of the hearing, the hearing judge granted the motion to strike, giving as his reasons: 1) The \u201conly purpose of [appellant\u2019s] seeking confinement at Springfield is for the purpose of evading and avoiding the trial on the merits, and that the Defendant doesn\u2019t sincerely and genuinely seek any psychiatric examination and evaluation to determine his mental condition\u201d; 2) \u201c. . . [T]he statement that he\u2019s been seeing an ear, nose and throat specialist who says he has some kind of difficulty with his inner ear would not be evidence on which any plea of insanity could be accepted. It has to be by psychiatric evaluation\u201d; and 3) \u201cI think the Defendant is merely attempting to evade and avoid trial on the merits\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-6\">The appellant was then re-arraigned. He was asked by the clerk, \u201cWhat is your plea guilty or not guilty? \u201d He answered, \u201cNot guilty\u201d and elected a jury trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-7\">Before determining the correctness of striking the appellant\u2019s insanity plea, it should be helpful to briefly review the nature of an insanity plea and the procedures to be followed when such a plea is filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-8\">Md. Rule 720 provides that an accused <em>\u201cmay </em>plead . . . not guilty by reason of insanity as provided by statute . . . .\u201d The subsequent adoption of Md. Code Art. 59, \u00a7 25 (b) (formerly \u00a7 9 (b)) designates the plea as to insanity as a \u201cplea in writing in addition to the plea or pleas otherwise required or permitted by law, <em>alleging that the defendant was insane at the time of the commission of the alleged crime\u201d </em>and requires that such a plea be filed <em>\u201c[w]hen it is desired </em>to interpose the defense of insanity\u201d.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The court may not refuse to accept the plea, and once filed, may not strike it out \u2014 any more than the court could strike out a not guilty plea. Indeed, once an insanity plea is filed, both trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>counsel and the court have a responsibility to see that it is not improvidently withdrawn, even at the request of an accused. See <em>Walker v. State, </em>21 Md. App. 666 (1974) and <em>White v. State, </em>17 Md. App. 58 (1973). As pointed out by this Court in <em>White v. State, supra, </em>at 61-62:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b385-5\">\u201c . . . [A] plea of insanity is no more than the assertion of an affirmative defense. The defense is not any different in its basic nature than other affirmative defenses, such as self-defense or coercion .... Like any defense, the question of whether an insanity defense should be raised remains a matter of trial strategy to be determined by counsel after consultation with his client\u201d.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b385-6\">Article 59, \u00a7 25 (b) of the Code specifies how and when the defense of insanity is to be raised and the procedural consequences that follow:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b385-7\">\u201c . . . The judge of the court in which such warrant, indictment or information is pending and in which such plea of insanity has been entered shall have full power and authority to order an examination of the mental condition of such person by the Department of Mental Hygiene, subject to the provisions of \u00a7 26 of this article. <em>At the trial </em>of any case where there has been theretofore filed a plea of insanity at the time of the commission of the crime, the court shall direct the jury to render a special verdict on the sanity of the defendant at the time of the alleged crime. No such verdict as to insanity of the defendant at the time of the alleged crime shall be directed or accepted unless a plea in writing alleging that the defendant was insane at the time of the commission of the alleged crime shall have been filed by the defendant or his counsel.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b385-8\">In <em>Strawderman v. State, </em>4 Md. App. 689, 697-698 (1968), we filled in the statutory gaps insofar as the correct procedure to be followed <em>at trial </em>is concerned. We pointed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>out: 1) that a person is \u201cpresumed to have been responsible for criminal conduct and sane at the time of such conduct until, after the filing of a proper plea, there is adduced proof that he lacked substantial capacity either to appreciate the criminality of his conduct or to conform his conduct to the requirements of law as a result of mental disease or defect<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> . . . sufficient to raise a doubt as to his sanity as defined in the minds of reasonable men\u201d; and 2) \u201cwhen there has been offered proof of insanity so defined sufficient to overcome the initial presumption of sanity of the accused the State must prove sanity, as well as the other elements of the offense, charged beyond a reasonable doubt\u201d. The opinion by Judge Orth (later Chief Judge of this Court and now Associate Judge of the Court of Appeals) went on, at 698:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-5\">\u201cSo when a plea has been filed in writing alleging that the accused was insane at the time of the commission of the alleged crime, the court should determine preliminarily whether the proof adduced in support thereof is sufficient to raise a doubt as to the sanity of the accused, as defined, in the minds of reasonable men. If it finds that it is not, the State has no further burden with respect thereto and, in a jury trial, the question is not submitted to the jury. If the court finds that the proof adduced was sufficient to surmount the threshold question of doubt as to the accused\u2019s responsibility, the State has the burden of convincing the trier of facts that the accused was sane, and, in a jury trial, evidence on the issue should then be introduced before the jury with proper instructions.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b386-6\">With this background, we turn to the propriety of the court\u2019s action in striking the insanity plea. The State\u2019s \u201cMotion for Appropriate Relief\u2019 concluded with a prayer to the court \u201cto conduct a hearing and grant the appropriate relief requested\u201d. At the hearing, the only \u201crelief requested\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>or even suggested was to strike the plea of insanity. We know of no law, rule, or procedure in this state that permits a court to strike a properly entered insanity plea.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> With respect to such a plea, the most that a court can do is to rule preliminarily whether the issue of insanity raised by the plea should be considered by the trier of fact pursuant to the guidelines set forth in <em>Strawderman, supra. </em>Even when the court determines under those guidelines that the issue of insanity should not be submitted to the trier of fact, the plea is not stricken; rather, the issue of insanity is simply not submitted to the trier of fact and the trial proceeds as if no insanity plea had been filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-5\">In this appeal, however, the appellant does not argue the propriety, <em>vel non, </em>of the court\u2019s action in striking his plea of insanity. Nor does he argue here the procedural propriety of a <em>Strawderman </em>type hearing prior to trial on the merits. As we understand the appellant\u2019s argument concerning the court\u2019s action, it is two-fold. First, he contends that he presented enough evidence at the hearing to raise a reasonable doubt as to his sanity and thereby place the burden upon the State to prove at trial his sanity beyond a reasonable doubt. Second, he contends that the court erred in its implicit ruling that he had by escaping forfeited his right to a psychiatric examination at State expense.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-6\">Appellant\u2019s first contention is without merit and needs little discussion. Proof sufficient to raise a doubt in the minds of reasonable men as to an accused\u2019s sanity can only be adduced through competent medical evidence to the positive effect that the accused, as a result of mental disorder, lacks substantial capacity either to appreciate the criminality of his conduct or to conform his conduct to the requirements of law. No such evidence was presented at the hearing. <em>See Millard v. State, </em>8 Md. App. 419 (1970); <em>Greenleaf v. State, </em>7 Md. App. 575 (1969); <em>Saul v. State, </em>6 Md. App. 540 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b387-7\">Appellant\u2019s second contention has merit. We hold that on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>the evidence before him, the hearing judge was clearly erroneous in his implicit ruling that appellant had forfeited his right to a free psychiatric examination.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> As the moving party, it was incumbent upon the State to present evidence to support such a ruling. The only evidence presented by the State was \u201cthe matters of record with regard to the placing of the charges\u201d and the undisputed fact that appellant escaped from Springfield on two occasions.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-5\">It is true that when an accused files an insanity plea he is under a legal obligation to submit to an examination by the State\u2019s psychiatrist, <em>Bremer v. State, </em>18 Md. App. 291 (1973), because as pointed out in <em>Bremer, </em>at 316, \u201cwhere he has pleaded insanity as a defense and presented evidence to meet the threshold question, the maintenance of a \u2018fair state-individual balance\u2019 requires that the State be permitted to have him examined\u201d. In this case, however, there is no evidence that the appellant has ever refused to be examined by a psychiatrist. The thrust of the State\u2019s motion was not that the State had been unable to obtain evidence to combat any threshold evidence of insanity that appellant might produce at trial, but that he had, by escaping from Springfield State Hospital, failed to take advantage of the opportunity to obtain at State expense any \u201cthreshold evidence\u201d at all and should therefore be deprived of the opportunity thenceforward from doing so. In other words, the appellant by escaping had forfeited his right to an examination at State expense and since, at the time of the hearing, he produced insufficient threshold evidence of insanity, his plea should be stricken.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-6\">There is no doubt that when appellant escaped from the place he had been sent for the sole purpose of obtaining evidence that might have supported his plea of insanity, he could not later complain that he had been denied the right to obtain such evidence if it is shown that because of the escape no examination could be conducted. Whether a forfeiture has occurred depends upon the facts and circumstances in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>each case. The fact of the escapes is one important factor, but it is not determinative of the issue. Here, the appellant was returned from his second escape to the Allegany County Jail on October 14, 1975. At that time, the order committing him to Springfield Hospital for examination was still in effect. As already mentioned, there is nothing in the record authorizing his transfer from Springfield Hospital to the jail. Nor is there any record evidence that had he been returned to the hospital, an examination could not have been completed. No one from the hospital testified at the hearing and there is no evidence of what, if any, precautions the hospital took or could have taken to detain him as requested by the judge. Nor is there any evidence that the appellant has ever refused to be examined by a psychiatrist. The State\u2019s contention that the appellant\u2019s only reason for filing an insanity plea was so that he could be sent to Springfield and escape is unsupported by the evidence. There is no evidence that prior to his first brief visit there he was aware of the poor security. The appellant\u2019s reason for escaping (\u201cI was more or less afraid that they would go cutting on me down there\u201d) may not appear to be a rational one. It would be a legal \u201cCatch-22\u201d,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> however, to hold that before a person is entitled to seek evidence of his insanity he must act rationally, or to hold that, because an indigent defendant who has filed an insanity plea acts irrationally, the State is relieved of its duty to provide him a psychiatric evaluation.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-5\">Here, in spite of appellant\u2019s escapes, we think more should have been done to see that the court order of July 2, 1975, requiring \u201ca complete psychiatric examination and evaluation\u201d was carried out. The State, knowing of the sieve-like security conditions that apparently prevailed at Springfield Hospital, could have petitioned the court to have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>appellant examined at a more secure State institution, such as Clifton T. Perkins Hospital. Also, we think that the hearing judge, upon being informed at the hearing that the appellant \u201cis still claiming and wants to maintain his plea\u201d, could have and should have taken measures to see that an examination be conducted.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-5\">Furthermore, as already indicated, we hold that it was error for the hearing judge to strike the insanity plea. Striking the plea prevented the appellant from ever offering to the court, or at trial, any evidence of his insanity at the time of the commission of the crimes charged; for the statute provides that without such a plea, \u201c[n]o . . . verdict as to insanity of the defendant at the time of the alleged crime shall be directed or accepted . . . .\u201d We cannot speculate whether the appellant could have obtained any such evidence from a source other than that provided by the State. Under the circumstances, even an attempt to do so would have been futile, for, even if obtained, without the requisite plea the evidence would have been all but useless to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-6\">\n<em>Judgments reversed; case remanded for new trial.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b390-7\">\n<em>Costs to be paid by Allegany County.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b380-11\">. We observe that since \u201cSection 23\u201d of Code Article 59 has nothing whatever to do with responsibility for criminal conduct, but \u00a7 25 does, it is manifest that appellant\u2019s counsel failed to cite the correct section of the Code. Section 23 sets forth the procedure to be followed when a defendant is believed to be incompetent to stand trial, an issue not raised by the appellant in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b384-9\">.
