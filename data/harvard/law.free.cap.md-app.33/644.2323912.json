On April <em>30,1975, </em>the District Council, acting after a granted motion for reconsideration of a previously granted conditional reclassification, denied the application for rezoning. Events occurring before the District Council in the intervening years were the causes of the timely and successful appeal by Bahrami to the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County. The trial court\u2019s reversal had the effect of restoring a prior order of the District Council that had granted conditional rezoning. Prince George\u2019s County, Maryland (\"County) now has appealed to this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-8\">County and Bahrami both question, for widely differing reasons, the issues that are available to the litigants in the appeal from the District Council\u2019s order of April 30,1975.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-9\">County contends that \u201cthe appellee should have taken action to terminate the reconsideration process in 1971. He <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number>cannot now come before the court and attack the reconsideration. An appeal [to the circuit court] could only be taken from the subsequent decision of the District Council denying the requested rezoning, and not from the Council\u2019s original action granting the petition for reconsideration.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b680-5\">Alternatively, the County contends that the trial court\u2019s restoration of the prior order of the District Council that had granted the requested rezoning with conditions, was erroneous. County argues that the trial court\u2019s action resulted from a misinterpretation of the zoning ordinance\u2019s time limitation upon the District Council\u2019s exercise of the right to reconsider. Otherwise stated, County also is contending: (1) that the motion for reconsideration, filed on March 4, 1971, was timely; (2) that the District Council\u2019s action on April 8,1971, in voting to reconsider its prior grant of the zoning reclassification to the subject property was a lawful and timely exercise of the authority conferred by the zoning ordinance; and (3) that the trial court\u2019s restoration of the District Council\u2019s previously granted conditional reclassification was erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-6\">Bahrami contends that the petition filed on March 4,1971, seeking reconsideration by the District Council of its prior order granting conditional reclassification, was without legal effect: (1) because of the alleged failure to serve the same upon two individuals claimed to have been parties to the original hearing; (2) because it lacked a required affidavit; and (3) because it was not acted upon within the time prescribed by law.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-7\">We reject, as did the trial court, County\u2019s first contention that Bahrami could not in 1975 appeal from the 1971 reconsideration order of the District Council. In <em>Kay Constr. Co. v. County Council, </em>227 Md. 479, 177 A. 2d 694 (1962), it was said at 489-90 [700]:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b680-8\">\u201cMoreover, this Court has construed statutory provisions for appeal from decisions of administrative agencies as applicable only to orders that are final in nature, and not to preliminary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>procedural or interlocutory orders. <em>Celanese Corp. v. Bartlett, </em>200 Md. 397, 90 A. 2d 208 (1952); <em>Bogley v. Barber, </em>194 Md. 632, 72 A. 2d 17 (1950). The resolution of the County Council granting reconsideration was not an order final in nature from which an appeal could be taken. Appellant was thus entitled, upon appeal from the subsequent unfavorable decision of the Council after the rehearing, to a review of the legality of the recons ideration. \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b681-3\">We reject the first two contentions of Bahrami because: as to (1) the individuals allegedly unserved with a copy of the petition for reconsideration are not shown by the record to have been parties to the cause in the original hearing before the District Council, and as to (2) the petition for reconsideration recites compliance with the provisions of the ordinance and bears the signature and seal of a notary public, plainly implying that the document was under oath as required thereby.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-4\">In our view, the basic question on appeal is:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b681-5\">Was the motion for reconsideration of the grant of reclassification with conditions acted upon within the time prescribed by ordinance?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b681-6\">If the answer to that question is \u201cNo,\u201d then the reconsideration action of the District Council was a nullity and the decision of the trial court restoring the prior order granting reclassification with conditions must be affirmed. If the answer to that question is \u201cYes,\u201d then the action taken by the District Council to reconsider was validly made and the decision of the trial court to the contrary must be reversed. In the latter case the cause must be remanded for determination whether the final action by the District Council in denying reclassification was reasonably debatable.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-7\">What we conceive to be the pertinent parts of the Prince George\u2019s Zoning Ordinance, bearing upon or controlling our decision in the subject case, are these:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b682-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>\u201c30.4 <em>District council action on proposed amendment.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b682-5\">No action shall be required by the district council on any proposed zoning map amendment at the time of public hearing. The district council shall announce its decision granting, denying, modifying, or deferring the proposed zoning map amendment within thirty (30) days of the date of public hearing. Deferred applications, upon which no decision is rendered within ninety (90) days of the date of deferral, shall be considered denied.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b682-6\">30.41 REVISORY POWER OF DISTRICT COUNCIL.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b682-7\">(a) For a period of thirty (30) days after the date of mailing the notice of the action or final decision of the district council on any application for a zoning map amendment, or thereafter pursuant to a petition for reconsideration filed within such thirty (30) day period, the district council shall have revisory power and control over such action or final decision. After the expiration of such period the action or decision shall stand and be the final determination as to all matters considered under the application and no revisions thereof may be made except to correct mistakes or irregularities not amounting to a change of use permitted in the zoning expressed in the decision.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b682-8\">(b) Reconsideration. The district council may, pursuant to a petition for reconsideration or upon its own motion, filed or acted upon within the time set forth in subparagraph (a) of this subsection, reconsider the application on such grounds as may be stated in the petition or motion. The petition, in addition to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>setting forth grounds for reconsideration, shall have contained therein an affidavit that the same is not filed for the purpose of extending the time of appeal of the action or decision, that there is good and sufficient reason to support the petition and that a copy of it has been served by regular mail, postage prepaid, upon each party who appeared at the public hearing or his spokesman or counsel. An opportunity will be given to the parties named in the record of the public hearing to be heard or to file a response if any member of the district council requests it before the petition or motion is acted on. The district council may act upon the petition for reconsideration with or without a hearing and shall act upon such petition or its own motion within sixty (60) days of the original decision or the same shall be deemed to be affirmed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b683-6\">80.5 <em>Conditional zoning.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b683-7\">In approving any zoning map amendment, the district council may give consideration to and adopt such reasonable requirements, safeguards and conditions (hereinafter referred to as \u2018conditions\u2019), as may in its opinion be necessary to protect surrounding properties from adverse effects which might accrue from such zoning map.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b683-8\">80.51 The applicant may in his application consent to conditions believed to be desirable for the consideration of the planning commission and the district council. Conditions consented to by the applicant in the application, or in the evidence adduced before the district <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number>council shall be binding if imposed by the district council. Conditions adopted by the district council shall become a permanent adjunct to the zoning map amendment and shall be binding so long as the zoning category granted by the council shall remain in effect.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b684-5\">30.52 When a zoning amendment is approved subject to adopted conditions, the applicant shall have ninety (90) days from the date of approval to accept or reject the land use classification as conditionally approved. The district council\u2019s action shall be final upon entry of an order incorporating the acceptance or rejection of the land use classification as conditionally approved. The applicant shall advise the council in writing within such period of the land use classification as conditionally approved. Failure to advise in writing within such period of such acceptance or rejection shall be deemed a rejection thereof. Rejection shall have the effect of voiding the zoning amendment and reverting the property to its prior zoning classification, and such reversion shall be evidenced by the passage of a board order by the district council.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b684-6\">Understanding of the disparate contentions of the litigants requires a knowledge of the dates on which the District Council acted and the nature of the action taken thereon from the first to the final action taken by the District Council:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b684-7\">Action Date</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AUm\">Public Hearing September 9,1970</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ACU\">Action Deferred October 7,1970</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b685-14\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>DATE</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AVdQ\">October 23,1970 Vote to Approve C-0 with conditions</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AOqV\">December 2,1970 Notice of October 23rd action sent</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A5U\">December 28,1970 Acceptance of Conditions</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A1NL\">February 2,1971 Vote to Approve after acceptance</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aq1\">February 10,1971 Notice of 2/2/71 decision sent</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A0O\">March 4,1971 Petition for Reconsideration received</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AyM\">April 8,1971 Vote to Reconsider</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AN_\">April 30,1975 Denial of Reclassification after Reconsideration</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A8lJ\">Appeal to Circuit Court for Prince</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AXq\">May 28,1975 George\u2019s County</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b685-9\">The litigants concede that Bahrami\u2019s appeal from the final order of the District Council was taken within thirty (30) days of its passage and permitted consideration whether the order appealed from was lawfully within its power at the time of passage.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-10\">The trial court held: (a) that the District Council vote to reconsider on April 8, 1971 was taken beyond the sixty day period provided by \u00a7 30.41 (b) of the ordinance and thus was beyond the lawful reach of District Council action, and (b) that the order passed by the District Council on February 2, 1971, granting conditional zoning reclassification was the final order of the District Council that fixes the zoning applicable to the subject property.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-11\">County\u2019s position on what we conceive to be the basic issue on this appeal is that February 10, 1971<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> is the beginning date for calculation of the sixty day period within which the District Council is authorized to reconsider a prior reclassification and that the vote to reconsider on April 8, 1971, was timely taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-12\">Bahrami takes two alternative positions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b685-13\">1. \u201c[T]he \u2018original decision\u2019 of the District Council was on the October 23, 1970, date when the District Council originally or first decided to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>conditionally grant the requested rezoning, and is the date from which the sixty (60) days [of \u00a7 30.41 (b)] is measured, and that the action by the District Council in granting the Petition for Reconsideration on April 8, 1971 was beyond the sixty (60) day requirement.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b686-5\">2. \u201c[E]ven if the date of the District Council decision on February 2, 1971, in granting the approval of the rezoning after the conditions had been accepted is considered as the \u2018original decision, the District Council still acted five (5) days beyond the sixty (60) day requirement when it acted on the Petition for Reconsideration on April 8,1971.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b686-6\">In <em>Crozier v. Co. Comm. Pr. George\u2019s Co., </em>202 Md. 501, 97 A. 2d 296 (1953), it was said at 506 [298]:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b686-7\">\u201cThe requirements of the [zoning] ordinance are binding on the Commissioners sitting as a District Council and they may exercise their zoning powers only by following the procedure specified; this is implicit, if not explicit, in Sections 985 and 988 of the Prince George\u2019s County Code and Sections 4 and 5 of Article 66B of the Code (1951 Ed.). The cases spell out the necessity of substantially complying with legislative procedural and substantive prerequisites as to notice and hearings if the action of zoning authorities is to be valid.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b686-8\">It is incumbent upon us accordingly, to examine and declare the meaning and effect of the subject zoning ordinance.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-9\">The rules of law governing our action in such a determination have been clearly stated and firmly fixed, as is demonstrated by reference to three decisions of the Court of Appeals of Maryland.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-10\">In <em>Md.-National Capital Park and Planning Comm., et al. v. Mayor and Council of Rockville, </em>272 Md. 550, 325 A. 2d 748 (1974), it was said at 555-56 [752]:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b687-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>\u201cThe cardinal rule of statutory construction is to ascertain and carry out the real legislative intent, <em>Radio Com., Inc. v. Public Serv. Comm\u2019n, </em>271 Md. 82, 93, 314 A. 2d 118 (1974); <em>Scoville Serv., Inc. v. Comptroller, </em>269 Md. 390, 393, 306 A. 2d 534 (1973); <em>Silberman v. Jacobs, </em>259 Md. 1, 267 A. 2d 209 (1970); <em>Atlantic, Gulf v. Dep\u2019t of Assess. &amp; T., </em>252 Md. 173, 249 A. 2d 180 (1969); and in ascertaining that intent, the Court considers the language of an enactment in its natural and ordinary signification, <em>City of Gaithersburg v. Mont. Co., </em>271 Md. 505, 511, 318 A. 2d 509; <em>Grosvenor v. Supervisor of Assess., </em>271 Md. 232, 315 A. 2d 758 (1974); <em>Radio Com., Inc. v. Public Serv. Comm\u2019n, supra. </em>If there is no ambiguity or obscurity in the language of a statute, there is usually no need to look elsewhere to ascertain the intent of the legislature, <em>Scoville Serv., Inc. v. Comptroller, supra; Atlantic, Gulf v. Dep\u2019t of Assess. </em>&amp; <em>T., supra. \u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b687-10\">In <em>Amalgamated Cas. Ins. Co. v. Helms, </em>239 Md. 529, 212 A. 2d 311 (1965), it was said at 585-86 [315-16]:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b687-11\">\u201cOf course, the cardinal rule of statutory construction is to seek and carry out the true intention of the Legislature. <em>Casey Devel. Corp. v. Montgomery County, </em>212 Md. 138. And in so doing, it sometimes becomes necessary, under unusual circumstances, to look to the spirit and purpose of an enactment. <em>Cearfoss v. State, </em>42 Md. 408; <em>Bickel v. Nice, </em>173 Md. 1; <em>Smith v. Higinbothom, </em>187 Md. 115. But Chief Judge Marbury very clearly pointed out in <em>Clark v. Tawes, </em>187 Md. 195, that the rule that real intent must prevail over literal intent is adopted only when the literal words of a statute say something that the Legislature could not possibly have meant. He said that this Court has repeatedly stated that as a general rule a court may not surmise a legislative intention contrary to the plain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>language of a statute, nor insert or omit words to make the statute express an intention not evidenced in its original form. See also <em>Pressman v. State Tax Comm., </em>204 Md. 78 and cases cited therein; and <em>Fowel v. State, </em>206 Md. 101. And, if a statute be plain and free from ambiguity, its application may not be enlarged or extended by construction. <em>Grimm v. State, </em>212 Md. 243.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b688-5\">\u201cIn other words, the courts, in the absence of ambiguity, should, as a general rule, confine themselves to a construction of a statute as written, and not attempt, under the guise of construction to supply omissions or remedy possible defects in the statute, or to insert exceptions not made by the Legislature.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b688-6\">In <em>Prince George\u2019s Co. v. White, </em>275 Md. 314, 340 A. 2d 236 (1975), it was said at 317-18 [239]:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b688-7\">\u201cNo rule of statutory construction is more fundamental than that, in ascertaining the intention of the Legislature, we are to read all parts of a statute together to find the intention as to any one part; and that all parts are to be reconciled and harmonized if possible.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b688-8\">It becomes quickly apparent that the sixty (60) day limitation upon the time within which a motion for reconsideration must be acted upon by the District Council cannot be held to begin on October 23, 1970, the date upon which the District Council voted <em>initial and tentative approval </em>of C-0 zoning with conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-9\">Reconsideration by the District Council is forbidden, either upon petition by a party or upon its own motion, unless \u201cfiled or acted upon within the time set forth in subparagraph (a) [of \u00a7 30.41].\u201d Action then is required thereon by the District Council \u201cwithin sixty (60) days of the original decision.\u201d \u00a7 30.41 (b), <em>supra. </em>Subparagraph (a) of \u00a7 30.41 in turn requires that a petition for reconsideration <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>must be filed within \u201cthirty (30) days after the date of mailing the notice of the action or final decision of the district council on any application for a zoning map amendment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b689-5\">Unless the thirty day limitation imposed upon the parties for the filing of petitions to reconsider and the sixty day limitation upon the power of the District Council to reconsider commence on the same date certain, an absurd result surfaces in conditional zoning cases. If the date of tentative initial approval of conditional reclassification (in this case October 23, 1970) were held to be the triggering date for the commencement of limitations upon the power of the District Council to reconsider its prior action, the applicant could defeat such reconsideration by the expedient of <em>delaying his acceptance </em>of the conditions imposed upon the reclassification <em>to a date subsequent to the sixtieth day after passage of the tentative order. </em>This is so because an applicant has ninety (90) days within which to accept or reject conditional zoning. \u00a7 30.52, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b689-6\">We think that <em>all </em>zoning reclassifications, including grants subject to conditions, were intended to be subject to the reconsideration provisions of the ordinance.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-7\">Moreover, under the ordinance, the tentative grant of conditional rezoning to an applicant automatically would abort and the property would revert to its prior zoning classification if the applicant rejected or failed timely to advise the District Council of acceptance (\u00a7 30.52). In short, the decision of October 23, 1971, was totally lacking in finality. We find no legislative intention to have the reconsideration provisions of the ordinance triggered by the passage of such a tentative order.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-8\">We find the language used in <em>Greenbelt Consumer v. Acme Mkts., </em>272 Md. 222, 226-27, 322 A. 2d 521, 524 (1974), particularly pertinent to the subject zoning ordinance:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b689-9\">\u201cThe principles which guide us in construing legislative enactments have been consistently applied by this Court for many years. Of these, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>cardinal rule requires that the legislative intent be discovered and carried out. This purpose must be discerned from the words the Legislature chose to employ unless there exists an ambiguity or obscurity, in which case we need to look elsewhere. <em>M.T.A. v. Balto. Co. Revenue Auth., </em>267 Md. 687, 695, 298 A. 2d 413 (1973). This is so, in the absence of a constitutional defect, even if we believe the policy'of the statute to be unwise, harsh or unjust. <em>Flanagan v. Flanagan, </em>270 Md. 335, 337-38, 311 A. 2d 407 (1973). Thus, in construing statutory language, we consider the words utilized in their natural and ordinary significance. However, if the phraseology employed has a doubtful meaning, this Court will examine the legislative intent so as to determine \u2018the objectives and purposes of the enactment and the consequences resulting from one meaning rather than another . . . .\u2019 <em>Md. Medical Service v. Carver, </em>238 Md. 466, 478, 209 A. 2d 582 (1965). Furthermore, if necessary in doing so, we will examine all parts of all pertinent legislative enactments which shed light on what is the true legislative purpose. <em>M.T.A. v. Balto. Co. Revenue Auth., supra; Hunt v. Montgomery County, </em>248 Md. 403, 414-15, 237 A. 2d 35 (1968); <em>Amalgamated Ins. v. Helms, </em>239 Md. 529, 535-36, 212 A. 2d 311 (1965).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b690-7\">We see in the subject ordinance a plain legislative purpose to grant to the parties a right to seek reconsideration of final action by the District Council but to impose stringent time limitations upon the initiation of such a right. We see as well an equally stringent time limitation upon the power of the District Council to reconsider a prior final action. Such a legislative purpose is achieved only if the parties\u2019 right and the District Council\u2019s duty is limited to final orders granting or denying requested reclassification with the same triggering date for the commencement of limitations upon the exercise of that right and that duty.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>We find nothing in the ordinance indicating a legislative purpose to exclude conditional zoning reclassifications from the reconsideration process or to indicate that the process was intended to be triggered by orders that are manifestly interlocutory in nature.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-5\">In sum, we hold that the initial, tentative grant of conditional zoning<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> is not such an order as will trigger commencement of limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-6\">We turn, accordingly, to the ultimate question: Was commencement of the period of limitations upon the power and authority of the District Council to act upon the petition for reconsideration triggered by the District Council\u2019s action: (a) on February 2, 1971 \u2014 when it voted to approve conditional rezoning after applicant\u2019s acceptance of the conditions; or (b) on February 10,1971 \u2014 when it gave notice of the voted approval of conditional rezoning by mailing the order to the parties to the zoning action?</p>\n<p id=\"b691-7\">If the date February 2, 1971, is the triggering date then the petition for reconsideration filed on March 4, 1971, was beyond the time limited by \u00a7 30.41 (a) (30 days). Similarly, in such a case the District Council\u2019s vote to reconsider, taken on April 8, 1971, was beyond the time limited by \u00a7 80.41 (b) (60 days).</p>\n<p id=\"b691-8\">On the other hand, if the date February 10, 1971, is the triggering'date, then both the petition for reconsideration and the District Council\u2019s action upon it were timely.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-9\">We think that February 10,1971, was the triggering date. The clear legislative determination to authorize conditional zoning contains not the slightest indication that the revisory and finality provisions of the ordinance should not apply to final orders in such cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-10\">The reconsideration provisions are interacting and apply fully to conditional reclassifications under \u00a7 30.5, <em>et seq., supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b692-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>We hold, accordingly, that the petition for reconsideration of March 4, 1971, was filed with thirty (30) days of the effective date of conditional rezoning (February 10, 1971). Similarly, the District Council\u2019s vote to reconsider (April 8, 1971) was taken within sixty (60) days of the effective date of the original decision (February 10, 1971). <em>See </em>\u00a7 30.41 (b), <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b692-5\">We are reinforced in this view by the fact that if the period of limitations for filing a petition for reconsideration were held to begin on the date of the vote by the District Council, the parties\u2019 opportunity to seek reconsideration would be lost if notice of decision was withheld for thirty-one days. In such a case, the ordinance\u2019s obvious purpose to assure meaningful notice of decision to parties to zoning cases would become a mockery.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-6\">\n<em>Order reversed and cause remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b692-7\">\n<em>Costs to abide the result of the ultimate decision.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b679-11\">. The application for rezoning from a residential to a commercial classification was filed prior to adoption of the charter form of government in Prince George\u2019s County.
