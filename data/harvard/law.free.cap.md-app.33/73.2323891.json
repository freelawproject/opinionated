Foster (husband), and the appellee \u2014 cross-appellant, Marguerite Z. Foster (wife), both appeal from portions of an amended decree entered in the Circuit Court for Baltimore County <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>which, among other things, granted the wife an absolute divorce, custody of the minor child of the parties, alimony, child support, and counsel fees of $7,500. The husband also appeals from an order entered on 30 December 1975 which, among other things, denied his motion for counsel fees for the defense of a contempt proceeding instituted on 16 December 1975 by the wife, allegedly in bad faith and without substantial justification.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-5\">Here, neither of the parties challenges the divorce, custody, alimony or child support provisions of the decree and order. In his appeal, the husband\u2019s contentions are that the chancellor erred in awarding the wife an excessive amount for counsel fees and in denying the husband counsel fees for his defense in the contempt proceeding. In her cross-appeal, the wife\u2019s sole contention is that the amount of the counsel fees awarded to her was inadequate.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b109-7\">The husband initially contends that the counsel fees awarded to the wife were excessive because they exceeded the amount she had agreed to pay. He maintains that a husband can be compelled to pay only such counsel fees as the wife is obligated to pay.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-8\">The husband asserts that here, there was a written agreement between the wife and her attorney, under which the wife was obligated to pay up to $5,000 for counsel fees. He claims that that agreement further provides for additional fees \u201cto come from a contingency arrangement based upon whatever her counsel could convince the Court to award as an attorney\u2019s fee against Dr. Foster or as a percentage of any property settlement.\u201d The husband argues that because contingency fee agreements are against public policy, these provisions are unenforceable. He concludes that the wife\u2019s total obligation under the fee agreement was limited to $5,000, and that consequently the husband could not be required to pay counsel fees of more than $5,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-9\">The husband\u2019s contention is without merit. A husband\u2019s obligation to pay counsel fees, in a case in which alimony or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>child support is claimed, is imposed by law.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The question of what constitutes a reasonable counsel fee lies within the chancellor\u2019s discretion.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In our view, a valid agreement between a wife and her attorney providing for a specified fee does not limit the chancellor\u2019s discretion in determining a reasonable fee, or require him to award no more than the agreed amount.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Other state courts agree.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Assuming without deciding that the wife\u2019s obligation here was limited to $5,000, the chancellor did not err in awarding counsel fees greater than that amount.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b111-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b111-6\">The husband further contends that the counsel fees were excessive because there was no evidence to show the time counsel spent conducting the case. This contention is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-7\">In determining the amount for a reasonable counsel fee, the ordinary factors of labor, skill, time and benefit, as well as the financial resources of the parties, must be taken into account.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> While time is one of the applicable factors, the record need not contain evidence specifically delineating the number of hours spent by counsel. Because the record itself discloses the nature of the proceedings, it is some evidence of the extent of the attorney\u2019s efforts. Given this evidence, the chancellor may rely upon his own knowledge and experience in appraising the value of an attorney\u2019s services.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b111-8\">Here the record shows that the chancellor took all of the appropriate factors, including time, into account. He examined the record, considered the nature of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>proceedings, and observed counsel\u2019s conduct at the hearings before him. There was more than sufficient evidence to support his findings. We find no abuse of discretion.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b112-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b112-6\">The husband further contends that counsel fees should not have been awarded because the evidence established that the wife\u2019s income and assets were sufficient to care for her needs. He maintains first that the real property held by the wife should have been considered as a financial resource in determining her ability to pay counsel fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-7\">Maryland Code (1957, 1973 Repl. Vol.) Art. 16, \u00a7 5 provides that in cases such as this counsel fees shall be awarded only if the wife\u2019s <em>income </em>is insufficient to care for her needs.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Courts in other states have recognized that it is the income from the wife\u2019s separate estate that is to be considered in determining her ability to pay counsel fees. A wife need not be required to impair or encumber her capital, including real estate, to finance her participation in divorce litigation.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Where the wife\u2019s assets, including real estate, do not produce adequate income, she may be entitled to counsel fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-8\">Here the record shows that as a result of the divorce litigation, the wife held, as a tenant in common with the husband, interests in real property valued between approximately $205,000 and $222,500. While some of the property had income-producing potential, none was producing income to the wife at the time, or was likely to do <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>so in the foreseeable future. Under these circumstances, the chancellor did not abuse his discretion by failing to take into account the wife\u2019s interests in real property in determining her ability to pay counsel fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-5\">The husband maintains next that the amount of alimony awarded should have been considered in determining the wife\u2019s ability to pay counsel fees. The question of whether the wife\u2019s income is sufficient to care for her needs ordinarily should be considered separately in relation to her ordinary living expenses, and in relation to her extraordinary expenses for divorce litigation.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The chancellor did not abuse his discretion in failing to take into account the amount of alimony awarded in determining the wife\u2019s ability to pay counsel fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-6\">Finally the husband maintains that the wife\u2019s ability to work should have been considered. The record shows that the wife had not been employed since 1958. Her youngest son, born in 1964, aged 11 at the time of the hearings, has serious physical disabilities, and requires after-school supervision from her. The evidence supports the chancellor\u2019s finding that the wife was justified in remaining home rather than seeking employment. Under these circumstances, the chancellor did not abuse his discretion in failing to take into account the wife\u2019s alleged ability to work, in determining her ability to pay counsel fees. There was adequate evidence to support the chancellor\u2019s finding that the wife\u2019s income was insufficient to care for her needs. His conclusion that she was entitled to counsel fees was justified.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b113-7\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b113-8\">The husband finally contends that the chancellor erred in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>denying his petition for counsel fees incurred in the defense of a contempt proceeding. He maintains that the wife brought the contempt proceeding in bad faith and without substantial justification, because she filed her petition for contempt with a judge, contrary to Third Judicial Circuit Rule S 4 b, which he alleges requires filing with the clerk of the court.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> He argues that, had the proper procedure been followed, the show cause order would not have been issued, because the Probation Department would have verified that payment of the arrearages had been made. He concludes that under Maryland Rule 604 (b) he is entitled to costs and reasonable expenses incurred in opposing those proceedings.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b114-5\">\u25a0 Maryland Rule 604 (b) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b114-6\">\u201cb. Bad Faith \u2014 Unjustified Proceeding \u2014 Delay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b114-7\">\u201cIn an action or part of an action, if the court finds that any proceeding was had (1) in bad faith, (2) without substantial justification, or (3) for purposes of delay the court shall require the moving party to pay to the adverse party the amount of the costs thereof and the reasonable expenses incurred by the adverse party in opposing such proceeding, including reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b114-9\">The question of reimbursement for litigation costs and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>expenses under this Rule is a matter which lies within the discretion of the court.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b115-5\">Here the record shows that on 16 December 1975, the wife filed her petition for contempt, alleging that from 7 November 1975 the husband had not paid alimony or child support. On that date, the chancellor issued an order to show cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-6\">At a hearing held on 24 December 1975, on the husband\u2019s \u201cPetition for Rehearing and to Revise Decree,\u201d and \u201cMotion for Attorney\u2019s Fees,\u201d as well as the wife\u2019s \u201cPetition for Contempt,\u201d the parties did not disagree that the arrearages were paid to the Probation Department before 16 December 1975, but that the wife did not receive payment until after that date. Moreover, at that hearing the wife withdrew her claim of contempt, and her petition was later denied. Under these circumstances, even assuming without deciding that Rule S 4 b was violated, we find no abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-7\">\n<em>Decree as amended on 13 November 1975 and order of 29 December 1975 affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b115-8\">\n<em>Costs to be paid by appellant.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b108-17\">.

The cases relied upon by the husband are inapposite. In Rubin v. Rubin, 233 Md. 118, 129, 195 A. 2d 696, 702 (1963), the Court of Appeals ruled that the charges of a private investigator could be allowed as \u201csuit money.\u201d An additional issue considered was whether the fact that the wife had paid part of the charges precluded a determination that her income was insufficient to pay for that particular need. There the question of the reasonableness of the charges was not raised. The court held that the husband was not required to reimburse his wife for that part of the charges for which she had paid. It did not hold that an agreement between a wife and her counsel necessarily determines the question of what constitutes a reasonable fee.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-8\">Mortgage Investors of Washington v. Citizens Bank &amp; Trust Co. of Maryland, 29 Md. App. 591, 349 A. 2d 647 (1976) involved a suit between a lender and a borrower, parties to a promissory note which specified the amount to be paid for attorney\u2019s fees in the event of suit upon default. The actual attorney\u2019s fee that the lender was obligated to pay was less than the specified amount. This Court held that the lender could recover up to the specified amount, but not more than it was obligated to pay.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-9\">The instant case involves a suit between a husband and wife rather than a lender, and a borrower. Moreover, the husband, unlike the borrower, was not a party to any agreement to pay counsel fees. This case does not involve a contractual obligation, but rather one imposed by law. Here the wife cannot be enriched by the court\u2019s award, because the award itself determines the amount of a reasonable fee.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b110-10\">. Corey v.
