Aragona, </em>21 Md. App. 45, 318 A. 2d 263, <em>cert. den. </em>272 Md. 746 (1974). In <em>Myers v. Aragona, </em>the Aragonas had recovered judgment against Mitchell Myers, an attorney at law, under a two count declaration alleging alternatively (a) that Myers was liable for the wrongful acts and breach of fiduciary duty perpetrated by his law partner, one Milton Gordon and (b) that Myers was liable because of his negligence in failing to discover that Gordon had misappropriated and stolen the monies of the Aragonas. We affirmed the judgment upon the ground that Myers was liable to the Aragonas by reason of the Uniform Partnership Act.* <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We found it unnecessary to decide whether Myers would have been liable by reason of negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-11\">St. Paul had issued to Mitchell Myers a policy of insurance providing the following coverage:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b534-12\">\u201cTo pay on behalf of the Insured all sums which the Insured shall become legally obligated to pay as damages arising out of the performance of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>professional services for others in the Insured\u2019s capacity as a lawyer and caused by the Insured or any other person for whose acts the Insured is legally liable. (The performance of professional services shall be deemed to include the Insured\u2019s acts as an administrator, conservator, executor, guardian, trustee or in any similar fiduciary capacity, but only to the extent for which in the usual attorney-client relationship the Insured would be legally responsible as attorney for a fiduciary.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b535-5\">The policy of insurance contained, <em>inter alia, </em>the following exclusion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b535-6\">\n<em>\u201cThis Policy Does Not Apply:</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b535-7\">(a) to any dishonest, fraudulent, criminal or malicious act or omission of the Insured, any partner or employee;. . .\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b535-8\">The Aragonas instituted suit against St. Paul on the policy issued by it,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> alleging that their final unpaid judgment against Mitchell Myers was within the coverage provided by the policy and that the exclusion did not apply because \u201cThe jury [in <em>Myers v. Aragona, </em>supra] returned a special verdict of <em>negligence </em>against Mitchell Myers.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b535-9\">The cause was submitted in a bench trial. The trial judge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>agreed with the Aragonas that the judgment fell within the coverage and without the exclusion of the policy and extended judgment against St. Paul for $310,000.00 with interest from the date of entry of judgment in <em>Myers v. Aragona, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b536-4\">In this appeal St. Paul contends, <em>inter alia, </em>that coverage for the loss of the Aragonas was barred by the specific exclusion in the policy issued to Myers.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-5\">The undisputed facts are these:</p>\n<p id=\"b536-6\">The Aragonas entrusted Milton Gordon, law partner of Mitchell Myers, with large sums of money to be deposited in the law firm\u2019s bank account for the purpose of the payment of construction loans. The \u201cmoney was never used the way it was supposed to be used\u201d but was \u201cmisappropriated and embezzled by Milton Gordon.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b536-7\">St. Paul contends that the defalcation falls squarely within the policy provision excluding \u201cany dishonest, fraudulent, criminal or malicious act or omission of the Insured, [or] any partner or employee.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b536-8\">The Aragonas, acknowledging that the funds were lost through the embezzlement and defalcation of the partner Milton Gordon, claim that the loss nonetheless came within the coverage of the policy because \u201cThis [exclusionary] clause does not affect the liability of the insurer toward plaintiffs who are now seeking payment of their judgment against Mitchell Myers, the insured, because Myers was exonerated of any dishonest acts. The jury returned a special verdict of <em>negligence </em>against Mitchell Myers.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b536-9\">The trial judge agreed that the exclusionary clause was not applicable, saying in the course of his written opinion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b536-10\">\u201cThe basis of recovery in the Jury\u2019s verdict which was taken oh a special issue and under express instructions of the Court was that the Defendant had failed to take the required action as a practicing lawyer to safeguard his clients interest. This verdict was affirmed on appeal and is no longer subject to further attack. Myers v. Aragona 21 Md. App. 45. That case determined that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>proximate cause of the loss was Myers own act. Myers actions not being \u2018dishonest, fraudulent, criminal or malicious\u2019 and having been found by the Jury to be a proximate cause of the Plaintiffs loss independent of the criminal acts if any of his partner we conclude the exclusion does not apply in this case.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b537-4\">We disagree with the trial judge and shall reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-5\">The rule of law governing the interpretation of insurance contracts was succinctly stated by Judge Frederick J. Singley, Jr. in <em>Govt. Employees Insurer v. DeJames, </em>256 Md. 717, 720, 261 A. 2d 747, 749 (1970):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b537-6\">\u201cIt is well settled that in interpreting insurance contracts, words are to be given their customary and normal meaning. <em>State Farm Mut. Auto Ins. Co. v. Treas, </em>254 Md. 615, 255 A. 2d 296 (1969); <em>American Home Assurance Co. v. Erie Ins. </em>Exchange, 252 Md. 116, 248 A. 2d 887 (1969); <em>Offutt v. Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., </em>251 Md. 262, 247 A. 2d 272 (1968); <em>Harleysville Mut. Cas. Co. v. Harris &amp; Brooks, Inc., </em>248 Md. 148, 151, 235 A. 2d 556 (1967), and cases there cited. Absent ambiguity the construction of the contract remains within the province of the court and Maryland has not adopted the rule, followed in many jurisdictions, that an insurance policy is to be most strongly construed against the insurer, <em>American Cas. Co. v. Aetna Cas. &amp; Surety Co., </em>251 Md. 677, 248 A. 2d 487 (1968); <em>Mateer v. Reliance Ins. Co., </em>247 Md. 643, 233 A. 2d 797 (1967); <em>Ebert v. Millers Mut. Fire Ins. Co., </em>220 Md. 602, 155 A. 2d 484 (1959). If the language of an insurance contract is ambiguous, however, construction is for the jury, <em>Ebert v. Millers Mut. Fire Ins. Co., supra, </em>220 Md. at 610; <em>Eagle Star </em>&amp; <em>British Dominions Ins. Co. v. Fleischman, </em>175 Md. 433, 2 A. 2d 424 (1938); 22 Appleman, <em>Insurance Law and Practice </em>\u00a7 12853 (1947) at 7, and the ambiguity is to be resolved against the company <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>which prepared the policy and in favor of the insured, <em>American Cas. Co. v. Aetna Cas. </em>&amp; <em>Surety Co., supra, </em>251 Md. at 684; <em>Allstate Ins. Co. v. Humphrey, </em>246 Md. 492, 496, 229 A. 2d 70 (1967).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b538-4\">Reaffirming Judge Singley\u2019s summary of that rule of law, the Court of Appeals in <em>C </em>&amp; <em>H Plumbing v. Employers Mut. Cas. Co., </em>264 Md. 510, 512, 287 A. 2d 238, 239 (1972), made this further observation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b538-5\">\u201cMoreover, we have no right to relieve one of the parties from disadvantageous terms by process of interpretation nor may we make a new contract under guise of construction.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b538-6\"><em>C &amp;H Plumbings, supra, </em>involved the interpretation of the following exclusionary clause:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b538-7\">\u201c3. THIS POLICY DOES NOT INSURE AGAINST:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b538-8\">(a) Loss caused by infidelity of an officer or employee of the insured whether such person is acting alone or in collusion with others or by infidelity of persons to whom the insured property is entrusted.\u201d 264 Md. at 513, 287 A. 2d at 239.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b538-9\">The Court then cited and commented upon a text relating to exclusionary clauses concerning dishonesty:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b538-10\"><em>\u201cRichards on the Law of Insurance </em>\u00a7 298 (5th ed. Freedman 1952) states:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b538-11\">\u2018Courts in construing and applying provisions of policies excepting from coverage loss or damage caused by the dishonesty of employees have respected the express language and denied liability on the part of the insurer.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b538-12\"><em>Id. </em>at 987.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b538-13\">\u201cIn support of that proposition the author cites <em>Hunter v. Pearl Assur. Company, </em>292 Mich. 543, 291 N. W. 58 (1940), and <em>Hoffman Bros. v. Commercial </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number><em>Union Assur. Co., </em>221 App. Div. 167, 222 N.Y.S. 641 (1927), aff'd 248 N. Y. 578, 162 N. E. 531. In <em>Hunter </em>the court held that \u2018theft\u2019 as used in a clause excluding theft by employees included larceny by conversion. In <em>Hoffman </em>a public porter was engaged to carry sample cases for the insured officer who was traveling seeking orders. It was held that the porter came \u2018within the class comprised by the words \u201cemployee, servant, or messenger.\u201d \u2019 \u201d 264 Md. at 514-15, 287 A. 2d at 240.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b539-4\">The Court then announced its holding:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b539-5\">\u201cIn the view we take of this case the word \u2018employee\u2019 in the context in which it is used would be understood by the average, ordinary individual as including the persons responsible for the thievery here. He would regard them as employees after quitting time as well as during their working day.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b539-6\">\u201cC &amp; H dwells on the meaning of the word \u2018infidelity\u2019 and attempts to compare that term to the meaning of the term in certain other insurance contexts, pointing to Code (1968 Repl. Vol.) Art. 48A, \u00a7 69 (1) in which fidelity insurance is defined as \u2018insurance guaranteeing the fidelity of persons holding positions of public or private trusts.\u2019 It then goes on to examine fidelity losses.*We do not regard the point as well taken.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b539-7\"><em>\u201cWebster, op. cit., </em>says of\u2018infidelity\u2019:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b539-8\">i^ * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b539-9\">\u20182. Breach of trust; unfaithfulness to a charge or to moral obligation; treachery; deceit; also an unfaithful act.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b539-10\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b539-11\">\u2018Syn. * * * perfidy.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b539-12\"><em>Random House, op. cit, </em>defines the term as \u2018unfaithfulness; disloyalty.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>\u201cUsing the common, every day understanding of the terms we are of the opinion that when persons who regularly worked for C &amp; H stole $10,000 worth of supplies this was a \u2018loss caused by infidelity of an employee of the insured.\u2019 \u201d264 Md. at 517,287 A. 2d at 241.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b540-4\">Appellees thus state their position on this issue:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-5\">\u201cMitchell Myers clearly neglected his duties to his clients and in so doing, his negligence allowed substantial resulting injury to appellees. In the plain meaning of the contract of insurance, if Myers had been dishonest himself or if his partner through dishonesty had caused the injury and Myers had <em>not </em>been found <em>negligent </em>in performing his normal duties as an attorney, then and only then would the company\u2019s exclusionary clause have been applicable, either to him directly or through his partnership relation. Defendant\u2019s argument that</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-6\">\u2018. . . there can be no instance where a loss is occasioned by a partner\u2019s dishonesty if the insured does discover the dishonesty and prevent the loss.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-7\">is circuitous. Considering the conclusion that through diligence a loss can be <em>prevented; </em>appellees\u2019 claim is substantiated even though a dishonest deed had been executed, the non-negligent conduct on the part of the attorney, Myers, could have prevented the resulting injury. Therefore, <em>negligence </em>on the part of the insured was in fact the causal link to the <em>loss </em>of appellees. It is indemnification against such negligence for which malpractice insurance is purchased.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b540-8\">The appellees cite only <em>Parker v. State Farm Mut. Auto Ins. Co., </em>263 Md. 206, 282 A. 2d 503 (1971), to support their stated position that the exclusionary clause does not apply. <em>Parker </em>does not support that position. On the contrary, <em>Parker </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>clearly recognized that when \u201cno ambiguity [appears] in the coverage, exclusionary, or definition clauses of the policy, . .. the insurance carrier contracted to underwrite a specific coverage and should not subsequently be expected to assume liability for a risk which it expressly excluded.\u201d 263 Md. at 215-16, 282 A. 2d at 508.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-4\">We see no ambiguity in the subject insurance contract. Using the common, every day understandings of the terms used in the exclusionary clause we are of the opinion that the subject loss was a result of \u201cdishonest... act... of the partner [of the Insured].\u201d <em>C &amp; H Plumbing, supra, </em>264 Md. at 517, 287 A. 2d at 241-42.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-5\">We are persuaded that the subject loss clearly falls within the exclusionary clause and was not within the protection afforded by the policy of insurance. The fact that the insured may have been negligent in failing to discover the perfidy of his partner may indeed have been an alternate ground for his liability to the Aragonas. It did not, however, extend the insured\u2019s coverage as to St. Paul or alter the plain and unambiguous language of the exclusionary clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-6\">Our ruling upon the discussed issue being dispositive of the case on appeal, we find it unnecessary to address the other contentions of the appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-7\">\n<em>Judgment reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b541-8\">\n<em>Costs to be paid by the appellees.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b534-14\">.
