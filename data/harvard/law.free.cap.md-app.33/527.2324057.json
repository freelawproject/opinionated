Rand (Robert) to pay $250.00 monthly for the support and maintenance of a minor child, Virginia Rand (Virginia) and to pay $75.00 monthly as alimony to Florence Rand (Florence).* <footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b562-10\">On August 7, 1975, Florence filed a petition to increase child support. On September 11,1975, Robert filed a petition for modification of alimony. The petitions were referred to a Domestic Relations Master pursuant to Sixth Circuit Rule S74.b.(ii).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b562-11\">The petitions were consolidated and heard together by the Master on October 27,1975. The Master\u2019s report detailed his findings of fact and recommended that the court pass an order: (a) requiring Robert to pay $480.00 monthly for the support and maintenance of the minor child of the parties <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>and (b) terminating the payment of alimony by Robert to Florence subject to reconsideration upon future showing of need and a substantial change of the financial circumstances of the parties.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Exceptions to the Master\u2019s report were filed by both Florence and Robert. Both sought further hearing in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-5\">On December 9, 1975, the chancellor passed the following order:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-6\">\u201cThe Court has read and considered the plaintiffs and defendant\u2019s Exceptions to the Report of the Domestic Relations Master. The Court has further considered the report itself with accompanying exhibits and has generally reviewed the two files. Exceptions to the findings of a Master will not be sustained except in the case of clear error or unless he misapplies the law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-7\">\u2018Exceptions to a report of an auditor or Master will not be sustained unless his findings of fact from the evidence are clearly erroneous or unless he misapplies the law in his findings of fact.\u2019 <em>Bris Realty Co. vs. Phoenix Savings and Loan Association, 238 Md. 84.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AnZ\">\u2018A Masters finding of fact from the evidence are prima facie correct and they are not to be disturbed unless determined to be clearly erroneous.\u2019 <em>Bar Association vs. Marshall, 269 Md. 510.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-9\">\u201cThe Court finds no clear error or misapplication of the law in this case and it is therefore, this 9th Day of December, 1975, by the Circuit Court for Montgomery County, Maryland,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-10\">\u201cORDERED that the Exceptions filed by the plaintiff and defendant are hereby overruled and that the request for a hearing in open court is denied and it is further</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-11\">\u201cORDERED that the defendant\u2019s counsel <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>promptly prepare an Order in accordance with the findings of the Domestic Relations Master.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b564-5\">A subsequent order of the Circuit Court for Montgomery County passed on January 6,1976, reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b564-6\">\u201cADJUDGED, ORDERED and DECREED, that the Plaintiff, Robert Collona Rand, pay to the Defendant, Florence Mitchell Rand, for support and maintenance of the minor child of the parties, namely, Virginia Rand, the sum of Four Hundred Eighty Dollars ($480.00) per month, commencing and accounting from September 1, 1975, and a like sum on the first day of each succeeding month, pending further order of this Court; and, it is, further,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b564-7\">\u201cORDERED, that the payment of alimony by the Plaintiff to Defendant shall be, and the same is hereby, terminated; however, the Court shall retain continuing jurisdiction for reconsideration thereof upon showing of a need and a substantial change in the financial circumstances of the parties, and it is, further</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b564-8\">\u201cORDERED, that in all other respects the Decretal Order of March 17, 1971, will remain in full force and effect, except as hereby provided for and modified.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b564-9\">Both Florence and Robert have appealed. Both attack the chancellor\u2019s refusal to grant a hearing in the circuit court.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b564-10\">\n<em>Rejection of Requested Hearing</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b564-11\">Sixth Circuit Rule S74.\u00cd.4. reads as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b564-12\">\u201cHEARING BEFORE THE COURT.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b564-13\">Upon the filing of exceptions pursuant to this section, the proceedings shall be referred to the Court. The Court shall then rule upon the exceptions on the record, unless it shall determine that a hearing is required, in which event the Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>shall refer the proceedings and the exceptions to the Assignment Office for the scheduling of a hearing on the exceptions and the notification of counsel.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b565-6\">Florence\u2019s initial attack is more basic than Robert\u2019s. Pointing out that Maryland Rule l.f.l. prohibits local rules that are inconsistent with the Maryland Rules, she contends that Sixth Circuit Rule S74.\u00cd.4. is in conflict with Maryland Rule 321.d. Maryland Rule 321.d reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b565-7\">\u201cd. DISPOSITION.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b565-8\">The court may decide <em>demurrers and motions </em>(except motions for a new trial or for judgment n. o. v.) without a hearing unless a party requests a hearing at the time or within fifteen days after the demurrer, motion or reply is filed. A request for hearing shall be in writing and may be either a separate pleading, or incorporated in the body of the demurrer, motion or reply at the end thereof under an appropriate heading.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b565-9\">The issue, in short, raised in the first prong of Florence\u2019s attack, requires determination as to whether Rule 321.d was intended to encompass exceptions to the report of a Master and thus to confer a right to a court hearing upon timely application therefor. We think that it was not.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-10\">The antiquity of the office of Master is the subject of lengthy explication in <em>Townshend v. Duncan, </em>2 Bland 45 (1828), in the course of which it was said at 55-57:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b565-11\">\u201cIn England, the officers called masters in Chancery are assistants and associates to the Chancellor; and two of them at a time, by turns, usually sit with him in Court. They have the power to administer oaths, take affidavits, and acknowledgments of deeds, recognizances, &amp;c. 1 <em>Harri. Prac. Chan. </em>73. It is the duty of a master to execute the orders of the Court upon references made to him by it, acting either in exercise of its original jurisdiction, or under the authority of any Act of Parliament. The heads of reference that may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>be made to a master are almost as numerous as the matters subject to the jurisdiction of the Court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b566-6\">\u201cIn general, there is no question of law or equity, or disputed fact, respecting which a master may not be called upon to make a report,....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b566-8\">\u201cIf, however, a master is directed to ascertain a particular fact, he ought himself to draw the conclusion from the evidence before him, and not merely to state the circumstances. <em>Lee v. Willock, </em>6 <em>Ves. </em>605.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b566-9\">In Miller, <em>Equity Procedure </em>(1897) \u00a7 555, page 653, it is said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b566-10\">\u201c \u2018A master in chancery is an officer of the court who acts as an assistant to the chancellor.... In Maryland the office at one period existed under the inherent jurisdiction of the court of chancery, independently of statute. Masters may now also be appointed under the constitutional provision that \u201cthe judge or judges of any court may appoint such officers for their respective courts as may be necessary.\u201d \u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b566-11\">The nature and effect of the report of a Master was succinctly stated by Judge J. Dudley Digges, speaking for the Court of Appeals, in <em>Bar Assn. v. Marshall, </em>269 Md. 510, 516, 307 A. 2d 677, 680 (1973):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b566-12\">\u201cPrevious opinions of this Court have discussed the importance to be attached to the findings of fact in a master\u2019s report by the ultimate trier of fact. In those cases we have said that although the report is only advisory, the court should give full consideration to it, particularly with respect to the credibility of witnesses, where the testimony is conflicting. And, the master\u2019s findings of fact from the evidence are prima facie correct and they will <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>not be disturbed unless determined to be clearly erroneous.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b567-4\">The contention that exceptants to the report of a Master have a <em>per se </em>right to present evidence <em>de novo </em>to the court by reason thereof was considered and rejected in <em>Bris Realty v. Phoenix Svgs. &amp; Loan Assn., </em>238 Md. 84, 208 A. 2d 68 (1965), wherein it was said at 88, <em>et seq. </em>[69]:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b567-5\">\u201c(I). <em>The refusal of the chancellor to permit the appellants to take testimony before him on the exceptions. </em>The record shows that the exceptions, as filed by the appellants to the special master\u2019s report, were general in form and failed to point out any finding of fact not supported by the testimony before the master, or any law misapplied by him to such facts in arriving at his allowance or disallowance of the respective claims.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b567-6\">\u201cThe appellants take the position that as to matters contained in those parts or paragraphs of the master\u2019s report to which they have generally excepted, they had the right to present testimony before the court <em>de novo, </em>citing <em>Egerton v. Reilly, </em>1 G. &amp; J. 385, and <em>Worthington v. Hiss, </em>70 Md. 172, as authority. These two cases furnish no such authority. In <em>Egerton, </em>this Court merely held that the lower court erred in referring a matter to an auditor before preliminary pleadings had brought the case to issue; and in <em>Worthington, </em>the appeal was from a decree remanding a case to an auditor with specific instructions to state an account upon principles laid down in the opinion accompanying the decree. Both sides appealed from the directions given to the auditor and no procedural question with respect to testimony either before the auditor or before the court was raised, and nowhere does it appear that the trial court, in hearing exceptions to the auditor\u2019s account before its remand, heard any testimony. The appellants also cite, <em>Sewell v. Sewell, </em>218 Md. 63, for the proposition that a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>master is not a judicial officer and therefore the court cannot delegate its judicial function to a nonjudicial officer. The short answer to this is that the <em>Sewell </em>case dealt with testimony taken before an <em>examiner, </em>not a master. The powers and duties of examiners and masters are not coextensive. The former merely records testimony for perusal of the court, see Miller, <em>Equity Procedure, </em>p. 262, <em>et seq., </em>whereas the latter, properly called an auditor and master, is an adviser of the court, makes findings, reports to the court and suggests the nature and propriety of the decree. Miller, <em>op. cit., </em>p. 654.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b568-5\">\u201cThe cases of <em>Maryland Lumber Co. v. White, </em>205 Md. 180, <em>Pinkston v. Higham, </em>224 Md. 513, and <em>Alexander v. Hergenroeder, </em>226 Md. 559, all dealing with reports of masters in chancery, clearly indicate our view that a master\u2019s findings are <em>prima facie </em>correct. When exceptions to auditor\u2019s reports are filed, they should point out the particular error or errors objected to and general exceptions cannot be considered. Miller, <em>op. cit., </em>p. 643; <em>Scrivener v. Scrivener, </em>1 H. &amp; J. 743; <em>Young v. Omohundro, </em>69 Md. 424. We believe this is equally true of exceptions to a master\u2019s report. One of the purposes of seeking the advice and recommendations of an auditor and master is to conserve the time of the court. If claimants had the right to offer new or additional testimony before the court, not only would there be no saving of the court\u2019s time but, perhaps, the whole structure of the auditor\u2019s and master\u2019s report would be worthless, thus requiring a remand and revision. Exceptions to a report of an auditor and master will not be sustained unless his findings of fact from the evidence are clearly erroneous, or unless he misapplies the law to his findings of fact. <em>Alexander v. Hergenroeder, supra.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b568-7\">In the light of the nature and effect of the Master\u2019s report and the conservation of the court\u2019s time sought to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>achieved by initial reference to him, we perceive no inconsistency between Sixth Circuit Rule S74.\u00cd.4. and Maryland Rule 321.d. As we see the latter Rule, the Court of Appeals did not intend to bring within its purview exceptions to the reports of a Master. That conclusion is buttressed by the circumstance that the Maryland Rules of Procedure make specific provision by Rule 910 for Juvenile Masters and the procedures to be followed when exceptions are taken in juvenile causes. As to Masters generally, however, no particular procedure has been prescribed by general rule. In view of this, most of the several Judicial Circuits of Maryland have adopted disparate local rules relating to the appointment and use of Masters, with some of them prescribing differing procedural courses to be followed when exceptions to Masters\u2019 reports are filed.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b569-6\">We assume that the Court of Appeals is aware of those differing local rules because Maryland Rule 1, \u00a7 f. provides that they shall be forwarded to that Court and to the State Court Administrator.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-7\">Accordingly, we see no illegality or impropriety in the enactment of a local rule leaving to the discretion of the trial court the question whether a court hearing upon the exceptions is necessary or desirable.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-8\">This Court has made plain, of course, that a local rule will not be permitted to demean or defeat the State\u2019s interest as <em>parens patriae </em>of minors or to lessen the obligation of the courts carefully to review cases in which their welfare is or may be threatened. In <em>Ellis v. Ellis, </em>19 Md. App. 361, 366, <em>et seq., </em>311 A. 2d 428, 431 (1973), we said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b569-9\">\u201cAfter all, it has been long established that the State, under our form of government, stands in its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>relationship to minors as <em>parens patriae. </em>See <em>Thistlewood v. Ocean City, </em>236 Md. 548; also 67 C.J.S. <em>Parens Patriae </em>624. And rule or no rule, parties in child custody cases are entitled to have the carefully and intelligently exercised judgment of the Chancellor, as distinguished from that of the Master\u2019s alone. Without having at least reviewed the testimony and evidence adduced at the hearing before the Master, the Chancellor clearly was in no position to fulfill his judicial obligation to the parties. Nor is this Court in a position properly to discharge its function since in a case involving custody of a child, when our appellate review of a Chancellor\u2019s action is invoked, we do not merely review the findings and order of the Chancellor but must review the evidence before the Chancellor and make an independent assessment of it. We cannot here review the facts before the Chancellor because there were none. <em>Deckman v. Deckman, </em>15 Md. App. 553. Moreover, the Chancellor did not even have the benefit of any so-called \u2018findings\u2019 of the Master (see <em>Bris Realty v. Phoenix, supra), </em>a requirement which the local rule does not compel in child custody cases, although a \u2018finding\u2019 as well as a \u2018recommendation\u2019 is required of a Master for Juvenile Causes. See local Rule 925.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b570-6\">We shall next address ourselves to the common contention of both Florence and Robert that the denial of a court hearing was an abuse of discretion under local Rule S74.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-7\">The factual posture of the subject case is markedly different than <em>Ellis v. Ellis, supra. </em>In <em>Ellis, </em>after observing that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b570-8\">\u201c. . . the Chancellor routinely and automatically adopted, without any knowledge of the status, circumstances and living conditions of the parents, the recommendation of the Master that custody of the child be taken from the mother and awarded to the father[,]\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b571-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>we declared:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b571-5\">\u201cUnder the circumstances, we see no other recourse than to remand the case to the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County with directions that the appropriate Chancellor in that court reconsider the order of January 30, 1973, in light of the now available testimony and evidence adduced at the hearing before the Master, Domestic Relations Causes, and issue such further order as the evidence and testimony would dictate to be in the best interest and welfare of the infant child of the parties.\u201d 19 Md. App. at 367-68, 311 A. 2d at 431.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b571-6\">In the subject case, on the other hand, the Master\u2019s Report of six pages made lengthy and explicit findings of fact in explanation of his recommendation. Moreover, the Master attached to that report numerous exhibits introduced by the parties at the hearing, including: (a) documents purporting to detail the income and expenses of Florence and Robert; (b) documents purporting to detail the costs of college attendance for Virginia; (c) the 1974 income tax return of Florence. Furthermore, portions of the testimony of Florence and Robert deemed by the parties to be of importance to their respective appeals were incorporated as appendices in their briefs to this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-7\">We are persuaded, accordingly, that the record before this Court is such that we are able objectively to review: (a) the exercise of the chancellor\u2019s discretion in the denial of a hearing upon the exceptions pursuant to the Sixth Circuit Rule S74; and (b) whether the chancellor\u2019s ultimate decision was clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-8\">\n<em>Exercise of Discretion Under Sixth Circuit Rule S7b</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b571-9\">The court order of December 9, 1975 (upon which the ultimate order appealed from was founded) makes clear that the chancellor had (1) read and considered the Master\u2019s report; (2) read and considered the exceptions to that report; (3) seen and considered the exhibits relating: (a) to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>income and expenses claimed by both parties; and (b) to the cost of college attendance by Virginia.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-5\">In short, the chancellor had access to and presumably considered all evidence presented by the parties upon the issues of a right to alimony by Florence and the cost of college attendance by Virginia.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b572-6\">At no point did the exceptions filed by Florence allege that additional evidence was essential to full consideration of the issues by the chancellor. Her complaints were that the Master (a) had not properly weighed the evidence; (b) had made mathematical errors in calculations; (c) should have required the husband to pay a greater amount \u201cbecause of his greater earning power\u201d; (d) failed to recognize \u201cthe wife was not forced to contribute to the support of the other children attending college during the marriage of the parties\u201d; and (e) ignored preliminary college expenses totaling $1,235.00.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-7\">Similarly, the exceptions by Robert failed to allege that additional evidence was desired or necessary for decision. His plaint, in brief, was merely that the Master\u2019s recommendation was unfair.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-8\">Under such circumstances, the evidence available to and examined by the chancellor clearly permitted him to pass objective judgment upon the recommendation of the Master. We perceive no abuse of discretion in his denial of a court hearing upon the exceptions.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-9\">\n<em>Child Support</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b572-10\">Florence contends that the amount required for the maintenance and support of Virginia is $668.44 monthly. She contends as well that \u201cthe mother is chargeable with the duty of support only to the extent that the father is incapable.\u201d The Master, supported by substantial and persuasive evidence, found that the amount required was $520.00 monthly. His finding is <em>prima facie </em>correct. We cannot say his finding, concurred in by the chancellor, was clearly erroneous. <em>Bar Assn. v. Marshall, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b573-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>Florence\u2019s contention that as the mother she is but contingently obligated to contribute to the support of her minor child is unsound under the circumstances of this case. She is employed with a substantial annual income. <em>See </em>Article 72A, \u00a7 1; <em>Melson v. Melson, </em>151 Md. 196, 206, 134 A. 136, 139-40 (1926). <em>See also </em>Article 46 Maryland Declaration of Rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-5\">Robert, conceding that the sum of $520.00 monthly is a reasonable amount for the support and maintenance of Virginia during the period of her college attendance, contends that the amount of $480.00 monthly required to be paid by him is an undue burden upon him under the evidence submitted to the Master.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-6\">It is not disputed here that Florence\u2019s gross income exceeds $16,000.00 per year <footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and that Robert\u2019s gross income exceeds $27,000.00 per year.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-7\">The Master found that Florence\u2019s net income was $832.20 monthly and pointed out that her financial statement showed a monthly need of $640.00 for her own support. Robert contends that the finding as to net income was erroneous and was in fact more than $100.00 per month higher. Florence\u2019s income tax return fully supports Robert\u2019s contention. The Master\u2019s finding was clearly erroneous as to the net income of Florence. It was in fact not less than $940.00 and left a balance after personal living expenses of not less than $300.00 monthly.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-8\">The Master found that Robert\u2019s net income was $1,488.10 monthly. There was substantial evidence to support the finding. Robert\u2019s financial statement indicated a monthly need of $996.00 for his own support. He thus was left with a balance of $492.10 that we shall round to $500.00 monthly.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-9\">The record indicates no apparent padding of the personal expenses of the parties. Under such a condition we conclude from the above that the chancellor was clearly erroneous in requiring Robert to pay $480.00 monthly for Virginia\u2019s support and maintenance. We think the proper assignment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>of parental responsibility for her support in this case fairly can be made on the basis of the net monies remaining available to the parties after expenses, namely $500.00 monthly as to Robert; $300.00 monthly as to Florence. Otherwise stated, we conclude that Robert should be burdened with five-eighths of Virginia\u2019s maintenance and support. In terms of dollars monthly this would be: 5/8 X 520.00 = $325.00 monthly.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-5\">\n<em>Florence\u2019s Claim for Counsel Fees</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b574-6\">The petition of Florence to increase child support included a claim for a counsel fee under Article 16, \u00a7 5A. Neither the Master nor the chancellor addressed that claim. It was neither granted nor denied. The allowance of counsel fees under \u00a7 5A is a matter directed to the discretion of the trial court. <em>Jackson v. Jackson, </em>272 Md. 107, 321 A. 2d 162 (1974). We think it is appropriate for the chancellor to consider the issue upon remand without comment or discussion by this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-7\">\n<em>Order reversed in part and remanded for the passage of an order not inconsistent with this opinion.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b574-8\">\n<em>The costs to be equally divided.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b562-13\">.
