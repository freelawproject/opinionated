J.,</author>\n<p id=\"A8W\">delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-11\">Joseph Midler, personal representative of Dorothy L. Midler, his mother, seeks to have us reverse a dismissal in the Circuit Court for Baltimore County (Raine, J.) of the bill of complaint brought by Joseph against Miriam Shapiro and her husband, Martin. Joseph perceives grievous errors as having been committed by the chancellor, but our examination of the record and the applicable law leads us to a different conclusion. Accordingly, for the reasons stated <em>infra, </em>we shall affirm the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-12\">A perusal of the record discloses that the late Dorothy Midler was married to Isadore Midler. The union produced two sons, Joseph, the appellant, and Samuel J. Midler. All parties lived in New York until Isadore\u2019s retirement in 1960, whereupon Dorothy and Isadore Midler moved to St. Petersburg, Florida. Approximately three years later, Isadore died. He left his entire estate to his widow, Dorothy Midler. Mrs. Midler continued to reside in Florida until she moved to the Baltimore area in 1970. During the seven years of his mother\u2019s widowhood that she lived in Florida, Samuel would visit her about once a year, and Mrs. Midler would, in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>turn, visit her sons in their respective homes in New York State for approximately one week each. She would also spend a week at the home of her niece, Miriam Shapiro, both en route to visiting her sons and in returning to Florida.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-5\">Samuel Midler testified that upon his father\u2019s demise he aided his mother in straightening out her financial matters. This was necessary, he said, because his father had been a very dominating man and his mother \u201c. . . knew very little of what was going on.\u201d The Florida local bank assisted Mrs. Midler after Samuel\u2019s return to New York.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-6\">When Mrs. Midler died in December, 1971, at age 78, Joseph, a member of the New York Bar, qualified as her personal representative and set about administrating his mother\u2019s estate in accordance with her will dated 1963. By the terms of the will, Joseph and Samuel were to divide the assets of the estate. As personal representative, Joseph located some fifty thousand dollars in stocks, two watches, and a house in St. Petersburg. The total estate coming into the hands of Joseph, as personal representative, was approximately $55,000. Joseph discovered there was no cash in the estate, and upon inquiry, he ascertained that the sum of approximately $40,000 had been on deposit in various banks or savings and loan associations. Two of the accounts were in the joint names of Dorothy Midler and the appellee, Miriam Shapiro, \u201cin trust\u201d for the other, subject to the order of either. After Dorothy Midler\u2019s death, Miriam transferred the monies to her own account. Joseph made demand for the money, but his demand was rejected, and the instant litigation resulted.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-7\">In this Court, Joseph puts four issues to us. We shall discuss each in the order in which it has been raised.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-8\">I.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b300-9\">\u201cThe Chancellor\u2019s finding that there existed a confidential relationship between Dorothy L. Midler and Miriam and Martin Shapiro from the time that Mrs. Midler moved to Baltimore and lived in the Shapiros\u2019 home in July, 1970 until her death <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>at the age of seventy-eight on December 19, 1971 was based on substantial evidence.\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b301-5\">The evidence disclosed that Mrs. Midler and Miriam Shapiro had always been \u201cclose.\u201d Their relationship was described as being more like mother and daughter than aunt and niece. Miriam took her aunt shopping and usually provided transportation. The appellant characterized Miriam as a domineering person who ran her family affairs in the manner suggestive of a \u201cmatriarch.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b301-6\">Prior to Mrs. Midler\u2019s moving to Baltimore, she, on June 27, 1969, opened an account in the Baltimore Federal Savings and Loan Association. At the same time, another account, bearing the next consecutive account number, was opened in the name of Miriam and Martin Shapiro. At the trial of the instant case, Miriam denied knowing that the account was opened at that time. In September, 1971, Mrs. Midler closed her account and transferred the amount of $15,121.20 into the Shapiro account.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-7\">Shortly after moving to Baltimore in July, 1970, Mrs. Midler opened a joint account at the Equitable Trust Company in her own name and the name of Miriam. Following Mrs. Midler\u2019s death, Miriam withdrew all the proceeds therefrom, a total of $14,738.74. No other sums had been withdrawn from the account during its life span.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-8\">A similar account was opened in the Provident Savings Bank on August 24, 1970. Miriam withdrew the sum of $2,000 therefrom in November, 1971, to cover medical expenses of Mrs. Midler. The expenses totaled $800. The balance was placed in Miriam\u2019s checking account. Subsequent to Mrs. Midler\u2019s death, Miriam withdrew the balance of the monies on deposit in the Provident account, namely, $10,989.35.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-9\">It was admitted that Miriam handled the banking for Mrs. Midler and often, if not usually, made the deposits and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>wrote out the checks, although Mrs. Midler generally signed the checks.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-5\">When Mrs. Midler became ill, it was Miriam who insisted that she see a doctor. The doctor testified that Mrs. Midler did not appear to be her stated age and was alert and in control of her faculties.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-6\">Judge Raine found as a fact that a confidential relationship existed between Mrs. Midler and her niece.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-7\">It is manifest from the record that Mrs. Midler reposed confidence and trust in Miriam, else she would not have conferred upon Miriam the right to withdraw Mrs. Midler\u2019s funds, nor in all likelihood would she have created joint accounts subject to her own and Miriam\u2019s order. There is nothing in the evidence to suggest even remotely that Mrs. Midler did not comprehend the effect of a joint account.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-8\">A confidential relationship exists whenever confidence is placed by one person in another and accepted by that other person. <em>Lynn v. Magness, </em>191 Md. 674, 684, 62 A. 2d 604, 609 (1948); <em>Grimes v. Grimes, </em>184 Md. 59, 63, 40 A. 2d 58, 61 (1944). Such a relationship may arise where a party is, under the existing circumstances, justified in believing that the other party will not act in a manner adverse or inconsistent with the reposing party\u2019s interest or welfare. <em>Bass v. Smith, </em>189 Md. 461, 469, 56 A. 2d 800, 804 (1948). It \u201c. . . extends to all relations in which confidence is reposed, and in which dominion and influence resulting from such confidence, may be exercised by -one person over another.\u201d <em>Zimmerman v. Bitner, </em>79 Md. 115, 126, 28 A. 820, 821 (1894). <em>See also Zimmerman v. Hull, </em>155 Md. 230, 240, 141 A. 531, 535 (1928); <em>Upman v. Thomey, </em>145 Md. 347, 358-59, 125 A. 860, 865 (1924).</p>\n<p id=\"b302-9\">Absent a presumption arising out of certain relationships <em>(e.g., </em>attorney-client, trustee-beneficiary, principal-agent), the existence <em>vel non </em>of a confidential relationship is a question of fact, not of law. <em>Sanders v. Sanders, </em>261 Md. 268, 276, 274 A. 2d 383, 388 (1971); <em>Wenger v. Rosinsky, </em>232 Md. 43, 48, 192 A. 2d 82, 86 (1963); <em>Masius v. Wilson, </em>213 Md. 259, 264-65, 131 A. 2d 484, 486-87 (1957); <em>Zimmerman v. Hull, supra </em>at 240, 141 A. at 535.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>Judge Raine, in the ease <em>mbjudice, </em>opined:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b303-5\">\u201cThe relationship [between Mrs. Midler and Miriam Shapiro] has been described by Mrs. Shapiro and also by an independent witness,... as being a very close mother-daughter type of relationship, and it is clear to me that for the periods of time in question Dorothy Midler, who was in her late seventies, . . . did place a great deal of trust and confidence in her niece, just as a mother would place trust and confidence in a beloved daughter. So, I make that finding as to the existence of a confidential relationship without any doubt whatever. I think it is crystal clear based on the testimony.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b303-6\">Our review of the evidence leads us to conclude that Judge Raine\u2019s finding of fact was not clearly erroneous, Md. Rule 1086, if indeed he was erroneous at all. Needless to say, we reject appellees' argument that the confidential relationship between the parties was not demonstrated, and that they should not have been required to go forward with evidence showing no undue influence<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> upon Mrs. Midler.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-7\">II.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b303-8\">\u201cThe Chancellor applied an incorrect legal standard in concluding that the Equitable Trust Company and Provident Savings Bank joint accounts, established with funds of Dorothy Midler, were intended to confer the right of survivorship uon [sic] Miriam Shapiro where the Chancellor did not follow the criteria of <em>Whalen v. Milholland </em>[, 89 Md. 199, 43 A. 45 (1899),] and its progeny and disregarded undisputed evidence that the accounts were established solely so Mrs. Midler might have the assistance and aid of her trusted niece in handling financial affairs.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b304-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>Both the Equitable Trust account and the Provident account were titled in the names of the decedent and Miriam Shapiro as joint owners, in trust for one another, subject to the order of either and the balance upon death to belong to the survivor. Such language has been held to create a trust, the corpus of which, by operation of law, becomes \u201c. . . the property of the survivor on the death of the other.\u201d <em>Wenger v. Rosinsky, supra </em>at 50, 192 A. 2d at 87; <em>Haller v. White, </em>228 Md. 505, 509-10, 180 A. 2d 689, 692 (1962); <em>Hancock v. Savings Bank, </em>199 Md. 163, 170, 85 A. 2d 770, 772 (1952); <em>Bradford v. Eutaw Savings Bank, </em>186 Md. 127, 133-34, 46 A. 2d 284, 287 (1946); <em>Milholland v. Whalen, </em>89 Md. 212, 218, 43 A. 43, 45 (1899). The creation of such a trust gives rise to a rebuttable presumption of its validity, and, usually, the burden is thrust upon the party seeking to rebut it. <em>Haller v. White, supra </em>at 510, 180 A. 2d at 692; <em>Blair v. Haas, </em>215 Md. 105, 115, 137 A. 2d 145, 150 (1957); <em>Ragan v. Kelly, </em>180 Md. 324, 330, 24 A. 2d 289, 293 (1942). When, however, a confidential relationship is shown, as in the case now before us, the burden shifts to the party seeking to uphold the validity of the trust and gift. <em>Wenger v. Rosinsky, supra </em>at 50, 192 A. 2d at 87; <em>Tribull v. Tribull, </em>208 Md. 490, 507, 119 A. 2d 399, 408 (1956). It then becomes the duty of the donee to demonstrate \u201c. . . that the donor understood the nature of the transaction and intended to make a gift.\u201d <em>Tribull v. Tribull, supra </em>at 507, 119 A. 2d at 408. <em>See Hancock v. Savings Bank, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b304-5\">Appellant strongly suggests that the \u201cFirst Milholland Case,\u201d 89 Md. 199, 43 A. 45 (1899), is controlling because there, as here, all the funds were the donor\u2019s, who retained possession of the bank book. The Court concluded upon that proof that no gift was intended or perfected. We think the \u201cFirst Milholland Case\u201d to be inapposite. In the instant case, unlike <em>Milholland, </em>the account was in \u201ctrust form,\u201d <em>i.e., </em>in trust for each other. The bank account in the \u201cFirst Milholland Case\u201d was not in \u201ctrust form,\u201d but read: \u201cElizabeth O\u2019Neill and Mary Whalen. Payable to the order of either or the survivor.\u201d Later, apparently without the knowledge of the donor, Elizabeth O\u2019Neill, the words \u201cJoint Owners\u201d were added when that form was adopted by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>bank. Although the words \u201cJoint Owners\u201d were stamped upon the passbook, Miss O\u2019Neill could not read. The Court held that a deposit of money by an owner thereof in a savings account with another person as \u201cjoint owners,\u201d payable to the order of either and the survivor of them, is not sufficient to constitute a gift to the survivor if the donor retains dominion over the passbook.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-5\">Seemingly attempting to draw an analogy between the \u201cFirst Milholland Case\u201d and that which now confronts us, appellant points to evidence tending to show that, as in <em>Milholland I, </em>Mrs. Midler retained possession of the passbooks. Even if that evidence, in the instant case, were undisputed as to that fact, the \u201cFirst Milholland Case\u201d is readily distinguishable. The evidence in the case <em>subjudice </em>is that the bank account was in the trust form sanctioned by \u201cThe Second Milholland Case,\u201d 89 Md. 212, 43 A. 43 (1899), and that it was in such form when it was opened. Mrs. Midler could read and was capable of comprehending what she was doing. No analogy may be properly drawn between the two cases. Moreover, there is no requirement that the passbook of the type of trust account used in the case now before us need be delivered to the donee in order to perfect the gift.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-6\">Appellant also invites our attention to <em>Pearre v. Grossnickle, </em>139 Md. 274, 115 A. 49 (1921), wherein the Court said that even the use of the trust form does not create a trust unless there is evidence of a specific intent to so do. <em>Pea,rre </em>does not mandate direct testimony of intent on the part of the creator of the trust. We think Pearre is satisfied if the trier of fact is able to draw from the evidence a rational inference of the specific intent-of the donor to create the trust.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-7\">Judge Raine found as a fact that Mrs. Midler intended to create the trust account, that the accounts were not mere convenience accounts made for the purpose of assisting Mrs. Midler in her everyday needs, and that Miriam did not play a \u201c. . . role in the creation of the accounts . . . .\u201d In short, Judge Raine was of the view that the appellees met the burden thrust upon them and demonstrated to the trier of fact that Mrs. Midler \u201c. . . understood the nature of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>transaction and intended to make a gift.\u201d <em>Tribull v. Tribull, supra </em>at 507, 119 A. 2d at 408. We have carefully reviewed the record, and we are unable to conclude that Judge Raine was clearly erroneous in his finding of fact. Md. Rule 1086. We perceive no error by the chancellor.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-5\">III.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b306-6\">\u201cIn the context of a confidential relationship, the Chancellor applied incorrect legal standards in concluding that Appellees met the burden of proving by clear and convincing evidence transactional fairness where he acknowledged that evidence of fairness was \u2018very scant\u2019 but nevertheless went on to disregard the test of <em>Highberger v. Stiffler </em>[, 21 Md. 338 (1864),] and its progeny by considering the case as if requiring proof of actual fraud and overweening influence rather than from the point of view of selfishness, unfair advantage, and unreasonable use of confidence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b306-7\"><em>Highberger </em>concerned the actions of a son in the management of his mother\u2019s business affairs. By virtue of the mother\u2019s age and their close relationship, the son\u2019s will had become that of the mother. The son caused the mother to convey to him for the \u201cnominal consideration\u201d of six hundred fifty dollars a \u201chouse and lot in Washington County.\u201d In fact, no consideration was paid, and the mother, who could neither read nor write, did not know that she had conveyed the property to her son. The fraud practiced upon her did not come to light until the son\u2019s death, when a partition proceeding was instituted upon the son\u2019s heirs. The mother sued to vacate the deed on the ground of fraud. The mother prevailed in the trial court, and the heirs appealed. The Court of Appeals, speaking through then Chief Judge Bowie, made clear that courts of equity will grant relief where confidence is reposed and then abused. 21 Md. at 352-53. The Court went on to state that, in such cases, whenever there is , . no consent of two minds, but a <em>merger </em>of the principal\u2019s mind into the agent\u2019s ... [,] ... it is not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>necessary to prove the actual exercise of overweening influence, misrepresentation, importunity or fraud <em>aliunde </em>the act complained of.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 353. Quoting Justice Story with approval, the Court continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b307-5\">\u201c \u2018On the one hand it is not necessary to establish that there has been fraud or imposition on the client, and on the other, it is not necessarily void <em>ipso facto. </em>But the burthen of establishing its perfect fairness, adequacy and equity, is thrown upon the attorney, upon the general rule that he who bargains in a matter of advantage with a person placing a confidence in him, is bound to show that a reasonable use has been made of that confidence, \u2014 <em>a rule applying equally to all persons standing in confidential relations until each other. </em>Story\u2019s Eq. sec. 312 . . . .\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 353-54.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b307-6\">More recently, the Court of Appeals has restated the rule in simplistic terms: Once a confidential relationship is established by the evidence, a heavy burden is cast upon the person in whom the confidence was reposed to show \u201c. . . that a fair and reasonable use has been made of the confidence, \u2018that the transfer of the property was the deliberate and voluntary act of the grantor and that the transaction was fair, proper and reasonable under the circumstances(citations omitted). <em>Sanders v. Sanders, supra </em>at 276-77, 274 A. 2d at 388; <em>Rice v. Himmelrich, </em>222 Md. 234, 239, 159 A. 2d 647, 650 (1960); <em>Masius v. Wilson, supra </em>at 265, 131 A. 2d at 486-87.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-7\">Some of the factors the Court must consider in determining whether the \u201cheavy burden\u201d of demonstrating \u201cfairness\u201d and \u201creasonableness\u201d has been met are: (1) the voluntariness of the act, <em>Sanders v. Sanders, supra </em>at 277, 274 A. 2d at 389; (2) the stripping of the donor of his or her assets vis-a-vis the incidence of control retained by the donor, <em>id.) </em>(3) the motive of the person in whom the confidence was reposed, <em>Rice v. Himmelrich, supra </em>at 239, 159 A. 2d at 650; (4) the degree to which the donor heeded the advice of the person possessed of the donor\u2019s confidence, <em>id.) </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>(5) whether the donor acted upon independent advice, <em>id. </em>at 240, 159 A. 2d at 650; <em>Williams v. Robinson, </em>183 Md. 117, 121-22, 36 A. 2d 547, 550 (1944); and (6) the comprehension of the donor of what he or she was doing. <em>Williams v. Robinson, supra </em>at 122, 36 A. 2d at 550.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-5\">Judge Raine, in summarizing the evidence, observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b308-6\">\u201c. . . The dead-man\u2019s statute prevents Mrs. Shapiro from testifying as to the transaction that took place between herself and the decedent, so the Court has to look at the only other evidence, and that is the testimony of Mrs. Austin. Mrs. Austin\u2019s testimony was brief, but her testimony was that Dorothy Midler was a very sharp woman, that she saw no signs that Miriam dominated her Aunt Dora, which is the way Miriam refers to Dorothy Midler, and she testified that Miriam had told her that Dorothy wanted to pay off the mortgage for her beloved niece, but that Miriam felt rather funny about it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b308-7\">Now, that negatives any idea that it was Miriam who was putting pressure on to get that mortgage money; it negatives any overweening influence. In addition, Viola Austin testified that she visited the decedent and the decedent opened a conversation by demanding to know from Miriam Shapiro whether she had taken care of that mortgage. So, it seems like it was all the idea, the act, and the wish to be beneficent toward Miriam.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b308-8\">. . . The evidence in this case is scant for the very reason that the dead^nan\u2019s statute excludes Miriam or her husband from testifying . as to any transactions they had with Mrs. Midler, but I believe that if you look at all of the circumstances that can be gleaned from all of the testimony in this case that the transactions were fair and reasonable under all the circumstances. I, as the trier of the facts, am convinced of that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b308-9\">On the other hand, I will confess that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>evidence in support of the Court\u2019s opinion is, to repeat, very scant by virtue of the very nature of a case of this type. Why do I think that it is fair and reasonable and provident? Well, number one, the decedent had three natural and very legitimate objects of her bounty, to wit, her two sons and the person who stood in the role of a daughter. The testimony discloses the assets owned by Mrs. Midler were in the neighborhood of one hundred thousand dollars, and she had executed a will shortly after the death of her husband in which she had left her estate to her sons equally. It made no provision whatever for Miriam.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b309-5\">It seems to me completely fair and reasonable that she would make some provision for Miriam. It seems to me only natural that she would want to do something for her niece who was going to do all that she could, and did all that she could, for Mrs. Midler in her last years. The evidence suggests that she really was closer to Miriam than she was to her two sons, whose contacts with their mother were limited to seeing their mother about once a year prior to the 1971 illness of the mother which brought them from New York to Maryland frequently to check into their mother\u2019s well-being. In view of the fact that they have family ties, I think it\u2019s only fair to say that during the last part of Dorothy Midler\u2019s life they did all that could have been expected by sons, but before a substantial period prior to that time they had'not been as close to their mother as Miriam had gotten to be. So, it seems to me to be only natural that the decedent would want to take care of Miriam.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b309-7\">The repeated characterization of the evidence as being \u201cvery scant\u201d is looked upon by appellant as a signal that appellees did not meet the burden they were required to shoulder. The term \u201cvery scant\u201d is relative and as such does not signify that the burden has not been successfully met. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>As we read the opinion of the chancellor, we are left with the belief that he was indicating that the evidence as presented crossed the threshold of \u201cclear and convincing\u201d but was scant in so doing. We, however, do not believe the evidence was as scant as the chancellor seemed to view it. Indeed, we think that the evidence viewed in its entirety fully justified the findings by Judge Raine.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-5\">IV.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b310-6\">\u201cThe chancellor erred in admitting over objection the denial by Miriam Shapiro of participation in the subject transactions because such a denial violates the Dead Man\u2019s Statute.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b310-7\">Md. Ann. Code, Courts and Judicial Proceedings Art., \u00a7 9-116 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b310-8\">\u201cA party to a proceeding by or against a personal representative, heir, devisee, distributee, or legatee, or by or against an incompetent person, <em>may not testify concerning any transaction with </em>or statement made by the dead or incompetent person, personally or through an agent since dead, unless called to testify by the opposite party, or unless the testimony of the dead or incompetent person has been given already in evidence in the same proceeding concerning the same transaction or statement.\u201d (Emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b310-9\">The statute is to be construed narrowly, <em>Schifanelli v. Wallace, </em>271 Md. 177, 184, 315 A. 2d 513, 517 (1974); <em>Snyder v. Crabbs, </em>263 Md. 28, 30, 282 A. 2d 6, 8 (1971); <em>Stacy v. Burke, </em>259 Md. 390, 404, 269 A. 2d 837, 845 (1970), because it is an exception to the policy stated in Courts Art., \u00a7 9-101. It should be interpreted in the light of its history and of \u00a7 9-101. <em>Trupp v. Wolff, </em>24 Md. App. 588, 597-98, 335 A. 2d 171, 177-178, <em>cert. denied, </em>275 Md. 757 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b310-10\">With the statute and the manner in which it is to be read in mind, we now examine the happenings during the trial which give rise to the issue before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>Over objection, Miriam Shapiro was allowed to testify that she had nothing to do with the opening of the bank accounts. The transcript discloses that the Shapiros\u2019 counsel posed a question to the witness as follows: \u201cDid you establish these accounts or any of them?\u201d Appellant\u2019s attorney objected on the ground that the response would be a violation of the transactional clause of the \u201cDead Man\u2019s Statute,\u201d and the trial judge overruled the objection. The record then reveals:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b311-5\">\u201cTHE COURT: . . . Did you have anything to do with establishing these accounts?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b311-6\">THE WITNESS: No, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b311-7\">THE COURT: That\u2019s admissible. She is denying that there was a transaction; that is far different from saying there was one.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b311-8\">BY MR. PIERSON [counsel for the Shapiros]:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b311-9\">Q Did you ask your aunt to establish these accounts?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b311-10\">MR. BELSKY [counsel for Midler]: Objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b311-12\">A No, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b311-13\">MR. BELSKY: Move to strike.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b311-14\">THE COURT: The question was leading, but on the other hand I think the witness is entitled to testify that she had nothing to do with the transactions, her involvement in the opening of accounts; I think she is entitled to do that. Now, you either ask her a leading question or you say \u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b311-15\">MR. PIERSON: What?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b311-16\">THE COURT: What conversations did you have with the decedent about the opening of the accounts, if any, and that puts you into a position where there\u2019s an objection as to the dealings between the two of them, which would be inadmissible under the dead-man\u2019s statute. Despite the fact it\u2019s leading, the Court will overrule the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>objection and let her testify that she had nothing to do with the opening of the accounts.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b312-5\">MR. BELSKY: May I say this for the record, Your Honor? It appears to me that what counsel is attempting to do is prove its case by this witness where the dead-man\u2019s statute is that if it\u2019s to be proven, it should be proven by a third party, and that\u2019s why we must continuously object.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b312-6\">THE COURT: You have your objection. I do not believe that that particular question violates the dead-man\u2019s statute.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b312-7\">BY MR PIERSON:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b312-8\">Q I think the question was, did you ask you aunt to establish any of these accounts?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b312-9\">MR. BELSKY: Objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b312-10\">THE COURT: There\u2019s an objection; the objection is overruled. Answer that yes or no.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b312-11\">THE WITNESS: State the question again.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b312-12\">MR. PIERSON: Read the question back.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b312-13\">(Whereupon, the Court Reporter reread the last question.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b312-14\">THE WITNESS: No.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b312-15\">We think the admission of such testimony to be erroneous. While the trial judge saw a difference between \u201cdenying that there was a transaction\u201d and \u201csaying there was one,\u201d we fail to see that distinction. In our view, testimony that a party litigant did not participate in a transaction with a decedent is as much a violation of the statute as is testimony that they did participate and why they did so. The latter is clearly proscribed by the statute. The former is, however, but a negative approach to achieving a circumvention of that forbidden by the latter. It is impermissible. <em>Jones v. Selvaggi, </em>216 Md. 1, 11, 139 A. 2d 246, 251 (1958).</p>\n<p id=\"b312-16\">The test for determining what is a \u201ctransaction\u201d within the meaning of Courts Art., \u00a7 9-116, is set forth in <em>Ridgley v. Beatty, </em>222 Md. 76, 159 A. 2d 651 (1960). The Court there said, quoting <em>Hollister v. Fiedler, </em>17 N.J. 239, 111 A. 2d 57 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>(1955), \u201c. . . that a proper test for determining what is a \u2018transaction with\u2019 a decedent in the statutory sense was: \u2018Whether, in case the witness testify falsely, the deceased, if living, could contradict it of his own knowledge.\u2019 \u201d 222 Md. at 83, 159 A. 2d at 655. Applying that test to the case <em>sub judice, </em>it is manifest that Mrs. Midler, had she been alive, could have, of her own knowledge, testified that Miriam Shapiro was or was not telling the truth. Mrs. Midler would most certainly have been in a position, were she alive, to testify whether Miriam prevailed upon her to open all or any of the three accounts. Thus, under the test, the matter to which Mrs. Shapiro was permitted to testify was within the scope of the prohibition established by the enactment of Courts Art., \u00a7 9-116, and its ancestors.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-5\">There remains, however, the question of whether the erroneous admission of the challenged testimony was harmless. We conclude that it was. We so do because our review of the record leads us to believe that there was substantial evidence, absent that which we think violated Courts Art., \u00a7 9-116, from which the trier of fact could properly find that the confidence reposed by the late Mrs. Midler was not abused by Miriam Shapiro. We think what the Court of Appeals said in <em>Jones v. Selvaggi, supra </em>at 11, 139 A. 2d at 251, to be a perspicuous statement of our perspective of this case: \u201cIf the answers to all of the objectionable questions to ... [Miriam Shapiro] be excluded, . . . there still remains ample relevant and admissible evidence to sustain the chancellor\u2019s conclusions for dismissing the bill of complaint.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b313-6\">\n<em>Decree affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b313-7\">\n<em>Costs to be paid by appellant.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b301-10\">. The contention contains a misstatement of fact. Mrs. Midler lived in the Shapiro house from July, 1970, to October 1, 1970, at which time she moved into her own apartment located near the Reisterstown Road Plaza shopping center.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b303-10\">. \u201c. . .
