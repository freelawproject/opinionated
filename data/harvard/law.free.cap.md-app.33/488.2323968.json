The case was tried upon an \u201cAgreed Statement of Facts\u201d supplemented by a minimum of testimony and evidence. The Agreed Statement of Facts hardly provided a skeleton of the case:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-8\">\n<em>\u201cAGREED STATEMENT OF FACTS</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-9\">1. On July 18, 1971 Budget Rent A Car rented to one John Carr an automobile which was involved in an accident on that day at the intersection of Belvedere Avenue and Bellona Avenue in Baltimore City, Maryland, while being operated by Carr.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-10\">2. At the time of the leasing of the vehicle, the rental agreement between Budget Rent A Car and Carr provided in pertinent part: \u2018Customer shall be insured under Budget\u2019s automobile liability insurance policy, but only if customer has no other liability insurance available to customer with respect to customer\u2019s use of the rental vehicle. Limits of liability available under Budget\u2019s automobile liability policy shall in no event exceed the limits specified in the Financial Responsibility Laws of this State.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-11\">3. A copy of relevant portions of said policy of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>automobile liability insurance issued by Ranger Insurance Company to Budget Rent A Car is attached hereto and is intended to be incorporated herein by reference. <footnotemark>[2]</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-4\">4. At the time of the accident of July 18, 1971, there was in full force and effect a policy of automobile liability insurance issued by Nationwide Mutual Insurance Company to Carr. A copy of relevant portions of said policy of automobile liability insurance issued by Nationwide Mutual Insurance Company is attached hereto and is intended to be incorporated herein by reference.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-5\">5. The accident of July 18, 1971 was caused solely by the negligence of Carr in his operation of the automobile rented by him from Budget Rent A Car. As a result of said accident, bodily injuries and property damage have been settled by Ranger Insurance Company for the total sum of $5,000.00. Said settlement is fair and reasonable in amount.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b524-8\">Neither the record nor the extracts contain a policy from Ranger to Budget. More significantly, the relevant portions <em>(i.e., </em>an.alleged contingent clause) are nowhere to be found. The declaration, however, alleges that such policy did exist and that it contained a contingent insured clause insuring:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-9\">\u201cAny person or organization using a rental vehicle with the permission of the owner, but only if such person or organization has no other automobile liability insurance available to him for the limits of liability at least equal to the Financial Responsibility Limits, whether on a primary, contributory, excess, or any other basis with respect to his use of the rental vehicle.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b524-10\">By contrast, the Nationwide-Carr policy is in the record and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>was attached to the stipulation. It contained an excess insurance clause which stated that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-4\">\u201c . .. the insurance with respect to temporary substitute automobiles ... shall be excess insurance over any other valid and collectible insurance.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b525-5\">Having settled the claim against Carr, after demand to defend Carr was made to Nationwide, Ranger sued Nationwide for indemnification, contending that its contingent clause prevailed over Nationwide\u2019s excess clause, citing <em>State Farm v. Universal Underwriters, </em>270 Md. 591, as authority. At trial, Ranger produced no witnesses, but did introduce two exhibits:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-6\">1. a certificate issued by the Insurance Commissioner showing that a \u201cSpecial Automobile Rental Liability Policy\u201d was filed and approved by the State Insurance Division on <em>December 15, 1971, </em>and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-7\">2. the automobile rental agreement between John Carr and Budget.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b525-8\">Nationwide then called an employee of the Insurance Division as its witness. Through him it introduced correspondence indicating that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-9\">1. On June 4, 1971 Ranger had submitted \u201ca Special Automobile Rental Liability Policy for filing with your office.....\u201d There is no indication who \u2014 if anyone \u2014 was the intended insured.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-12\">2. On July 9, 1971 a letter indicating disapproval was mailed by the Insurance Division to Ranger. The reason for disapproval was the policy\u2019s \u201c... failure to meet the Financial Responsibility Law....\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-13\">3. Ranger responded to that disapproval by letter dated July 15, 1971. It recognized that the policy\u2019s contingent insurance clause was one <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>reason for the disapproval, but requested reconsideration.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-4\">4. An exchange of correspondence followed, including submission by Ranger of several registered amendments and endorsements.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-5\">5. After several endorsement proffers were rejected, the Insurance Division approved an endorsement on December 6, 1971 and the policy as a whole on December 15,1971.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b526-6\">The trial judge decided that, under the Financial Responsibility Law, the Legislature intended:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-7\">\u201c ... as a matter of public policy, that those who provide vehicles for hire must also protect the public by providing insurance coverage for those authorized to drive such rental vehicles.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b526-8\">He further held that the Insurance Commissioner\u2019s initial rejection of the policy and the several endorsements was proper because Ranger\u2019s policy did not provide <em>primary </em>insurance for Budget\u2019s customers. He held that Md. Code, Art. 66V2, \u00a7 8-101 reflected the intent of the General Assembly that such required insurance be <em>primary </em>insurance. That section reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-9\">\u201c(a) The Department 1<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>1 shall not register any motor vehicle, trailer or semitrailer to be rented, unless and until the person owning such vehicle shall certify financial responsibility as provided by this article, and such certification has been accepted by the Department, and the Department shall suspend the registration of any such vehicle whenever the Department ascertains that such owner has failed, or is unable, to maintain such proof of financial responsibility.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-10\">(b) Certification required under this section shall cover every person using or operating a vehicle <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>under a rental agreement and shall also cover the person owning such motor vehicle.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b527-4\">(c) Any person violating the provisions of this section shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b527-5\">He, therefore, concluded that Ranger could not prevail against Nationwide because:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b527-6\">\u201c . . . (1) if the policy was in force, Ranger is primarily liable, and (2) if the policy was not in force, Ranger has no standing against Nationwide in a suit for indemnification.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b527-7\">Ranger does not question the judge\u2019s alternate conclusion. Instead, Ranger disputes the holding that \u00a7 8-101 places the primary liability upon it. It further argues that the Insurance Commissioner wrongfully disapproved its policy and that it was, therefore, in force. From that premise it contends, as noted, that the contingent insured would prevail over Nationwide\u2019s excess coverage clause. But because Ranger failed to prove that the policy it allegedly issued Budget contained a contingent insured clause, we see no way we can reach the merits of Ranger\u2019s arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-8\">For Ranger to have an enforceable claim against Nationwide it had to show, <em>inter alia:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b527-9\">that Nationwide issued an insurance policy to Carr and that the policy, by its terms, covered the July 18,1971 accident;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AqsJ\">that Ranger issued an insurance policy covering Carr and that the policy, by its terms, covered the July 18,1971 accident; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AIM\">that Ranger\u2019s responsibility was secondary to Nationwide\u2019s.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b527-12\">These prerequisites had to be more than merely alleged; they had to be proven either by evidence or by agreement between the parties. The first element was satisfied by the stipulation, in the Agreed Statement of Facts, that Nationwide insured Carr. A copy of the pertinent terms of that policy was attached to the Agreed Statement of Facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>While it was equally important that Ranger also establish that it insured Carr, the proof of this element was less than satisfactory. The existence of such a policy was only alluded to in the Agreed Statement of Facts, Nationwide never expressly admitted that Ranger had insured Carr, and a copy of that alleged policy was neither appended to the Agreed Statement of Facts nor introduced into evidence. Nevertheless, a fact-finder could reasonably infer that Ranger had issued <em>some </em>policy which purported to cover Carr. But a fact-finder would not be at liberty to speculate about the contents of that policy. This is particularly true here, for the very heart of Ranger\u2019s indemnification claim is its assertion that the policy contained a contractual absolution of responsibility to Carr and that,' by virtue of this particular clause, its responsibility to Carr was contingent upon Carr\u2019s inability to collect insurance from Nationwide. It is, therefore, clear that Ranger must <em>prove </em>that its policy contained the alleged contingent insured clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-4\">The only evidence before the court below of the contents of <em>any </em>Ranger policy was the blank form policy. This policy had been approved by the Insurance Commissioner on December 15, 1971, nearly 5 months after Carr\u2019s accident. Contrary to appellant\u2019s contention in its brief, this policy was not appended to the Agreed Statement of Facts. Instead, it was attached to the certificate of approval from the Insurance Commissioner which was introduced at trial with the unenlightening proffer:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b528-5\">\u201cMR. SMALKIN: I would also like to file, if the Court please, a certificate from the Department of Licensing and Regulations dated March 5, 1974, which goes back to the 1971 policy.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b528-6\">THE COURT: Do you want to file that as an exhibit? Plaintiffs Exhibit 1.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b528-7\">While we have strained to infer from the Agreed Statement of Facts that <em>some </em>policy was issued by Ranger to Budget which purported to cover Carr, a fact-finder would go too far if he were to assume from that exhibit or its proffer, that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>the purported Ranger-Budget policy at the time of the accident was the same as the blank form policy approved by the Insurance Commissioner 5 months after the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-4\">Absent evidence or agreement that the policy issued by Ranger contained the contingent insured clause upon which Ranger relied, the trial court\u2019s exercise in statutory interpretation became an exercise in futility. The court may not presuppose matters of evidence that have not been proven or stipulated. Nor may it judicially notice a contract provision not in evidence since such provision is neither a self-evident nor a notorious fact. <em>Cf. Macht v. Hecht Co., </em>191 Md. 98, 102; <em>Barsallo v. Barsallo, </em>18 Md. App. 560, 565-567. Thus in the absence of evidence of such a provision in its policy, it is of no consequence whether Ranger\u2019s payment on Carr\u2019s behalf was under a valid policy, a purported policy or gratuitously under no policy at all. Ranger did not produce evidence in any form sufficient to raise the issue of whether it or Nationwide was the primary insurer against Carr\u2019s accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-5\">Nor does it alter the result whether the \u201cAgreed Statement of Facts\u201d may have been in actuality that which it was entitled or more in the nature of a stipulation. As we pointed out in <em>Barnes v. State, </em>31 Md. App. 25, 35:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b529-6\">\u00bfUnder an agreed statement of facts ... [t]here is no fact-finding function left to perform. To render judgment, the court simply applies the law to the facts agreed upon.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b529-7\">If the judge had limited his application of the law to the facts in the Agreed Statement he could not have reached the ultimate issue because there is no statement of what Ranger\u2019s policy had purported to cover for Budget.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-8\">If, however, the \u201cAgreed Statement of Facts\u201d were in reality a stipulation as to certain facts only \u2014 as it appears to have been since both parties supplemented it by the introduction of evidence \u2014 the need to provide the relevant language of the policy sued upon is equally evident.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-9\">Finally, even if we could assume that the form policy submitted to the Insurance Commissioner on June 4, 1971 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>and finally approved (with endorsement U4172) on December 15, 1971, 5 months after the Carr accident, was the same as the Ranger-Budget policy presumably issued to Budget sometime prior to the accident, Ranger still may not recover.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-4\">The evidence showed that the form policy was submitted for approval to the Insurance Commissioner on June 4,1971, but not disapproved until July 9,1971. Under Md. Code, Art. 66V2, \u00a7 7-324, a policy submitted is deemed approved after 30 days if not disapproved within those 30 days. Thus, it would appear possible that the form policy had been approved by operation of law and later revoked in accordance with the Commissioner\u2019s authority to do so under that section.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-5\">The statute provides for the circumstance where a policy has been issued by an insurer, approved by the Commissioner of Insurance, but then revoked by the Commissioner. See \u00a7 7-324 (b).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The company, even if it did in fact issue a policy purporting to comply with the financial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>responsibility laws of the State, is statutorily bound by its act even in the event of subsequent revocation for noncompliance:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b531-4\">\u201c\u00a7 7-324. REQUIREMENTS FOR POLICY OF INSURANCE OFFERED AS PROOF.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b531-5\">(a) <em>Definition; approval of Commissioner of Insurance; effect of issuance of policy or filing of certificate. \u2014 </em>A policy of insurance, as that term is used in this subtitle, when offered as proof of financial responsibility under this subtitle, means an automobile public liability and property damage policy, issued by an insurance carrier authorized by the Commissioner of Insurance of the State of Maryland to transact business in this State. A copy of the form of the policy shall be filed with the Commissioner of Insurance who shall within 30 days approve or disapprove of the same. If the Commissioner of Insurance approves the same within such time or fails to take action for 30 days the form of policy shall be deemed approved; provided, however that the Insurance Commissioner shall not approve, and his failure to approve or disapprove shall not be deemed an approval of, a form of policy which does not meet the minimum requirements specified in this subtitle. And provided further that <em>when a policy of insurance has been issued which purports to be under the terms of this subtitle, </em>or when a duly authenticated certificate of the insurance carrier has been furnished to the Department or the Public Service Commission as the case may be under the terms of this subtitle, <em>the insurance carrier shall be obligated at least to the extent of the minimum requirements of this subtitle, any provision of the policy of insurance to the contrary notwithstanding. \u201d </em>(emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b531-6\">The language of that section clearly contemplates the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>precise circumstance here provided. To bring the terms of this section into play it is sufficient that a policy was issued prior to final approval, purporting to conform to the Financial Responsibility Subtitle requirements. The very issuance of such policy purporting to so comply obligated Ranger to the minimum financial responsibility requirements. . The section concludes with a clause which disposes of Ranger\u2019s reliance upon the contingent insured provision:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b532-4\">\u201c . .. any provision of the policy of insurance to the contrary notwithstanding.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b532-6\">Whether the Legislature intended that the coverage contemplated by \u00a7 8-101, standing alone, be primary was a question the trial judge below did not have to reach. \u00a7 8-101 does not set forth standards of certification of policies by the Insurance Division. It provides that there must be proof of financial responsibility for the Department of Motor Vehicles to register, or continue the registration of, \u201cfor-rent vehicles\u201d. A policy issued purporting to fulfill these registration prerequisites of \u00a7 8-101 by providing \u201cproof of financial responsibility\u201d falls under the requirements of \u00a7 7-324. Clearly the Legislature did intend that the company purporting to issue <em>any </em>policy offered as \u201cproof of financial responsibility\u201d prior to approval (or after disapproval) would b.e primarily obligated under \u00a7 7-324 (a). The statutory provision negating the effect of any policy provision to the contrary adds emphasis to the intent of the Legislature to provide protection to the public from those companies who choose to act before receiving the Insurance Division\u2019s approval.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-7\">Furthermore, appellant\u2019s case is premised upon a belated collateral attack upon the disapproval of the form policy by the Insurance Commissioner. Having acquiesced in that decision through negotiations which eventually resulted in a policy which eliminated the Insurance Commissioner\u2019s grounds of disapproval, we fail to see how appellant has standing now to attack the disapproval collaterally in a suit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>against another insurance company. The Legislature provided an administrative remedy in the event of disagreement. See Md. Code, Art. 48A, \u00a7 242B. Appellant complains belatedly and in the wrong forum.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-4\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b533-5\">\n<em>Costs to be paid by appellant.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b523-12\">.
