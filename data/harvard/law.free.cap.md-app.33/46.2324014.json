Lyle <em>et ux. </em>(the Lyles), sought, unsuccessfully, in the Circuit Court for Charles County to recover from appellee, Tri-County Federal Savings and Loan Association of Waldorf (Tri-County), allegedly usurious interest and other charges. For reasons to be stated, we are of the opinion that the interest charges were usurious and, therefore, we hold that part of the determination by the trial court to be in error.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-6\">The facts are relatively simple. The Lyles desired to construct a home in Prince George\u2019s County. They obtained a loan commitment from Tri-County. They executed a note to Tri-County in the amount of $60,000 bearing interest at 8%. Payment of the note was secured by a deed of trust of the same date which referred to the note. On the same day a loan agreement was executed. It recited that the Lyles owned a lot \u201cupon which said land [Tri-County] ha[d] [t] heretofore agreed to loan the sum of . .. $45,000.00 ... to be secured by the Deed of Trust [t] hereinabove mentioned, and the said money to be so loaned to be used in improving the said land by the erection thereon of a dwelling .. ..\u201d The dwelling was to be completed within 12 months. Provision was made for payment by Tri-County of the $45,000 in 9 installments as work progressed. At settlement Tri-County\u2019s check in the amount of $60,000 was presented to and endorsed by the Lyles. The settlement sheet reflects disbursal of $15,000 from the loan proceeds to the seller of the lot. The remaining balance of $45,000 of the loan proceeds was paid over to Tri-County. The president and \u201cmanaging officer of Tri-County\u201d testified that this sum \u201cwas deposited to an account maintained by Tri-County at the Bank of Southern Maryland.\u201d He said it went into that bank \u201calong with all the other moneys that was taken in by Tri-County on April 15th, 1974, which totaled $82,158.96.\u201d No escrow account was maintained. Tri-County did maintain a record of \u201cloans in process\u201d and the balance kept on hand in its account was said to always be equal to or greater than the total amount committed to loans. The account was used for such things as payment of employees\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>salaries and other monthly expenses of Tri-County. Also collected at settlement and paid over to Tri-County was $60 for an appraisal fee, $10 for a credit report, and $90 for nine inspection fees in accordance with the schedule in the loan agreement. The credit report and appraisal fees were disbursed by Tri-County to other parties. The house was not constructed as planned and the $90 sum for inspection fees ultimately was returned to the Lyles. The Lyles abandoned their construction plans and settled with Tri-County on September 24, 1974, repaying the $15,000 at that time plus $573.29 accrued interest on the full $60,000. At the same time they were given credit for the $45,000 retained. Interest had been paid in the interim in accordance with the schedule originally agreed upon. This interest was at all times on the full $60,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-5\">The Lyles brought suit claiming that Tri-County \u201ccharged and collected from [them] usurious interest and fees of $1,633.83\u201d and that under Maryland Code (1957, 1972 Repl. Vol.) Art. 49, \u00a7 8 they were \u201centitled to three times the amount of interest and charges collected on any loan in excess of the interest and other charges authorized by that Article, or the sum of $500.00, whichever is greater....\u201d The trial judge found the fees \u201cnot [to be] a payment of interest over and above the eight per cent allowed by law.\u201d He noted that the $45,000 \u201cwas deposited in the bank, admittedly deposited with other funds,\u201d and that the testimony of the president of Tri-County \u201cwas that there is a general ledger which controls, which they use to control the funds that are put in the bank and that they retain sufficient funds in several banks to cover all outstanding construction loans which are in progress ... at any given time.\u201d He concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b82-6\">\u201cSo the Court, gentlemen, feels that the commitment was made, the testimony shows that the funds were available for the benefit of Mr. and Mrs. Lyle, in accordance with their agreement. They agreed that the funds were to be retained by the lending institution in accordance with their agreement and there is nothing that I can find in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>any statute in the State of Maryland, which prevents the individual from entering into this agreement authorizing the lending institution to make such disbursal of funds as, for which they had signed the deed of trust.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b83-6\">\u201cThe Court, for that reason, will grant the motion and will enter a verdict, enter a judgment nisi in favor of the defendant.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b83-7\">Two questions are presented on this appeal: (1) whether the credit, appraisal, and inspection fees were interest and thus usurious; and (2) whether the charging of interest by Tri-County on the full amount of the loan from the date of settlement while holding $45,000 in its own account was usury under Maryland law.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-8\">i</p>\n<p id=\"b83-9\">The Law</p>\n<p id=\"b83-10\">Maryland Constitution Art. Ill, \u00a7 57 provides, \u201cThe Legal Rate of Interest shall be <em>Six per cent, per annum; </em>unless otherwise provided by the General Assembly.\u201d (Emphasis in the Constitution.) The background and history of usury statutes was traced for the Court of Appeals by Judge Delaplaine in <em>Plitt v. Kaufman, </em>188 Md. 606, 610-12, 53 A. 2d 673 (1947). It is important to remember that the statute in effect in Maryland at that time and for most of the years since adoption of the constitutional provision was far different from the statute in effect today. Maryland Code (1957) Art. 49, \u00a7 3, originally enacted by chapter 69 of the Acts of 1704, defined usury as \u201cexact [ing], directly or indirectly, for loan of any money, goods or chattels to be paid in money above the value of six dollars for the forbearance of one hundred dollars for one year, and so after that rate for a greater or lesser sum, or for a longer or shorter time . . ..\u201d This law was changed by the enactment of Chapter 453 of the Acts of 1968, codified as Code (1957, 1972 Repl. Vol.) Art. 49, \u00a7\u00a7 1-11. Interest is defined by \u00a7 1, with certain charges not considered interest, while \u00a7 3 provides that \u201c[i]nterest may be charged not in excess of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>rate of six percent (6%) per annum simple interest <em>on the unpaid balance, </em>except that interest may be charged at the rate not in excess of eight percent (8%) per annum simple interest <em>on the unpaid balance </em>under an agreement in writing between the lender and the borrower.\u201d (Emphasis added.)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> By \u00a7 6 usury is defined as \u201cthe collection by a lender of either interest or other charges in amounts greater than allowed by ... [Ajrticle [49].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b84-5\">In <em>B. F. Saul Co. v. West End Park, </em>250 Md. 707, 246 A. 2d 591 (1968), the Court of Appeals considered \u00a7 1 (b) (6) (C) exempting from consideration as interest \u201c[a]ctual expenses collected by the lender ... [f]or . .. costs not retained by the lender ... in connection with the loan.\u201d Judge Finan observed for the Court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b84-6\">\u201cWe adopt the lower court\u2019s classification of specific items as set forth in its order.... The main thrust of the lower court\u2019s rationale is that the determining factor, in the event of any ambiguity as to whether or not a fee or charge should be included as interest, is whether such charge is retained by the lender and, if so, it should be treated as interest. That such a construction is a projection of the intent of the Legislature becomes manifest upon reading the Act <em>.\u2019\u2019Id. </em>at 723.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b84-7\">To like effect <em>see Equitable v. Insurance Comm\u2019r, </em>251 Md. 143, 148, 246 A. 2d 604 (1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b84-8\">In <em>Plitt </em>Judge Delaplaine said for the Court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b84-9\">\u201cThis Court has held that no device or subterfuge of the lender will be permitted to shield him in taking more than the legal interest on a loan. In whatever part of the transaction usury may lurk, or in whatever form it may take, or under whatever guise the lender may attempt to evade the law, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>court will seek to ascertain what the contract actually was between the parties and give the debtor relief. <em>Andrews v. Poe, </em>30 Md. 485 [(1869)]; <em>Brenner v. Plitt, </em>182 Md. 348, 84 A. 2d 853 [(1943)].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 611.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b85-5\">n</p>\n<p id=\"b85-6\">Credit Report, Appraisal Fee and Inspection Fees</p>\n<p id=\"b85-7\">Neither the charge for the credit report nor that for the appraisal fee was retained by Tri-County. It is clear from the evidence that the inspection fee would have been disbursed to the person making the inspection had the Lyles proceeded with their building. The fee was in fact refunded to the Lyles. Thus, under the holding in <em>West End </em>we are of the opinion that these charges are not usurious.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-8\">iii</p>\n<p id=\"b85-9\">Collecting Interest on the Sum Retained by Tri-County</p>\n<p id=\"b85-10\">Tri-County relies upon <em>Bettum v. Mont. Fed. S. &amp; L. Ass \u2019n, </em>262 Md. 360, 277 A. 2d 600 (1971). That case is factually inapposite. As Judge Singley pointed out for the Court of Appeals in that case, the statute under which we here consider the question of usury \u201cdid not become effective until 1 July 1968, more than two years after Montgomery Federal made its loan.\u201d Moreover, there \u201cboth parties seemingly concede[d] that the controversy [was] controlled by the law of the District of Columbia, where the mortgaged property [was] located and the loan was made . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b85-11\">We see this case as one of statutory interpretation. Because of the peculiarities of the Maryland statute, cases from other jurisdictions are of little help.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-12\">Cases abound in Maryland in which the Court of Appeals has stated that the cardinal rule of statutory construction is to ascertain and carry out the real legislative intent and that in ascertaining that intent the Court considers the language of an enactment in its natural and ordinary signification. <em>See, e.g., Gillespie v. R &amp; J Constr. Co., </em>275 Md. 454, 457, 341 A. 2d 417 (1975), and cases there cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>We regard the significant language in the statute here to be that which we emphasized in our earlier quotation, that interest is to be calculated \u201con the unpaid balance.\u201d Webster\u2019s New International Dictionary (2d ed. 1959) says of \u2018balance\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b86-5\">\u201c7. a An equality between the sums total of the two sides of an account.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b86-7\">\u201cb The excess on either side, or the difference between the two sides, of an account.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b86-8\">The Compact Edition of the Oxford English Dictionary (1971) states by way of a definition:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b86-9\">\u201c17.

Shadrick, </em>69 Md. 528, 16 A. 138 (1888), cited by Black, the question presented was whether a statement filed with a declaration in assumpsit \u201ccomplied with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>provisions of sec. 171 of the Act of 1886-in respect to filing an account, or a sufficient statement of the particulars of the [defendant\u2019s] alleged indebtedness as to entitle him, the [plaintiff], to a judgment by default under that statute.\u201d The account filed referred simply \u201c[t]o a balance due on the purchase money of [certain] houses ....\u201d The statute required the plaintiff to \u201cfile with his declaration an affidavit ... stating the true amount the defendant [was] indebted to him ....\u201d Judge McSherry said for the Court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b88-5\">\u201cInasmuch as a balance is claimed, it is perfectly evident that there must be a debit and a credit side to an account from which that balance was taken. The balance so produced is not an account, but the result of an account. It bears to an account precisely the same relation that a conclusion does to the premises of a syllogism. <em>McWilliams v. Allan, </em>45 Mo. 573. An account is the statement of two merchants or others who have dealt together, showing the debits and credits between them. 1 Bouv. Law Dic. 48. The correctness of the balance depends upon the accuracy of the debits and credits.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 531.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b88-8\">So long as the $45,000 in question was solely under the control of Tri-County it could not be a part of \u201cthe unpaid balance.\u201d Had this sum been placed in an escrow account not subject to the sole control of Tri-County, then it properly would be a part of \u201cthe unpaid balance.\u201d To us the plain meaning of the term \u201cthe unpaid balance\u201d is the net amount under the deed of trust note due from the Lyles to Tri-County. Accordingly, when Tri-County attempted to collect interest on the entire $60,000 at the rate of 8%, $45,000 of which it retained, it was guilty of usury.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-9\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed in part and reversed in part, and case remanded for entry of a judgment consistent with this opinion; appellee to pay the costs.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b84-10\">.

The term there used is interest \u201con the unpaid principal balance of a loan.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b84-11\">There are certain exceptions in both the 1968 and 1975 acts which are not relevant to this proceeding.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
