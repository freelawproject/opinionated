Long testified that on Sunday, the tenth day of March \u2014 being the day before the birth of the child \u2014 she had a conversation with the complainant, who had, in the morning, called her up some hours earlier than usual, saying that she was unwell. In that conversation she stated that the defendant was or would be the father of her child. The complainant grew more unwell during the day, and in the evening made those complaints of pain which women commonly make during their <em>accouchements. </em>Late in the evening, in a conversation between her and the witness, the complainant again said that the defendant was the father of the child. The witness further testified that the complainant continued.to grow worse until the birth of the child, in the afternoon of Monday, the next day.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b470-9\">Hannah Long testified that she was with the complain-, ant from one o\u2019clock in the afternoon of Monday, the 11th of March, until the birth of the child, and no conversation was heard by her concerning the paternity of the child.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b471-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>Martha Shaw was present from six o\u2019clock in the afternoon of the same day till the birth of the child, and heard nothing said on the subject.

Harrington, 5 Pick. 63. How long the time of travail may be, or how long before the birth it may commence, has not, as a question of jurisprudence, been determined in this State.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-12\">In the present case one witness states, that late on Sunday evening, which might have been twenty-four hours before the delivery, those pains had commenced, and that after they had commenced the complainant stated to the witness, who was attending her, and who had been called for the purpose of attending her, that the defendant was the father of the child.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>It does not appear that the witness continued to attend the complainant throughout the term of labor, or that the declaration was made to those who succeeded to her office.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-5\">We cannot hesitate to say that the testimony of the witness shows that the declaration was made within the period required by the statute; that it was made to a proper person, she being then in attendance; and that it was to the effect required by the statute for qualifying the complainant to testify in the trial. It ;s not necessary that the declaration should be repeated to each person who may, in succession, minister on the occasion, or that-more than one should actually receive it.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-6\">The complainant, having complied with the statute, was correctly admitted to testify, and there must, therefore, be</p>\n<p id=\"b472-7\">\n<em>Judgment on the verdict.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
