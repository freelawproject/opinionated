In view of the fact that the policy of insurance issued by appellant provided that it was to be responsible for a proportionate share only in the event of the existence of other valid and collectible insurance against a loss, and since, at the time of the loss, there was valid and collectible insurance with respondent Lumbermen\u2019s against that loss, then appellant can only be chargeable for its proportionate share thereof, namely, $15,555.55. <em>(American Lumbermens Mut.

III. An insurance company with knowledge of a loss cannot cancel flat so as to affect the rights of the injured party simply <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>because there may be other insurance against all or part of the loss. IV. Cosmopolitan Mutual Insurance Company, plaintiff-appellant, has a right to disclaim liability for the accident of June 19, 1958, in view of the fact that its assumption of the risk on August 8, 1958 was made retroactive to June 1, 1958, without knowledge or information that an accident had already occurred, and in view of the fact that the insured and its broker concealed such knowledge and information. <em>(Continental Cas.

Lumbermen\u2019s Mutual Casualty Company, defendant-respondent, had coverage for Riva Service Corp. on the date of the Higgins \u2019 accident and is legally obligated to pay, within the limits of its coverage, the amount needed to settle the Higgins\u2019 claim on behalf of Riva Service Corp. VI. Cosmopolitan has not waived its rights herein and should not be estopped from asserting the claim that it should be relieved of any liability for the June 19, 1958 accident. <em>(Draper </em>v. <em>Oswego County Fire Assn., </em>190 N. Y. 12; <em>Spiegel </em>v. <em>Metropolitan Life Ins. Co., </em>6 N Y 2d 91; <em>Ross </em>v. <em>New York Life Ins. Co., </em>68 F. 2d 727; <em>Sebring </em>v. <em>Fidelity Phenix Fire Ins.

The judgment of the Appellate Division should be reversed as contrary to law and to the facts in this case; the judgment of the trial court should be modified by a declaration by this court that Cosmopolitan Mutual Insurance Company did not cover Riva at the time of the Higgins\u2019 accident on June 19,1958, and that Lumbermen\u2019s Mutual Casualty Company should reimburse Cosmopolitan in the sum of $23,333.33, the sum paid by said Cosmopolitan without prejudice pending a determination of the respective rights of these two insurance companies, together with costs and disbursements.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b186-4\"><em>Sidney A.

Lumbermen\u2019s binder was lawfully and properly \u2018 \u2018 cancelled flat \u2019 \u2019 by Riva\u2019s broker, Buhler, who had complete authority in this matter and who cancelled the binder flat in accordance with the usual practice and custom of the insurance industry and, as found by the court below, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>with the desire and specific authorization of Riva. Said cancellation nullified said binder as of the date of its inception with no resulting liability on the paid of Lumbermen\u2019s and was correctly so held unanimously by the court below. <em>(Allstate Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Passick, </em>2 A D 2d 391; <em>Jefferson </em>v. <em>Sinclair Refining Co., </em>10 N Y 2d 422; <em>Karelsen </em>v. <em>Sun Fire Office of London, </em>122 N.

In an attempt to obtain sympathetic treatment from this court respecting its contentions as to the cancellation flat of Lumbermen\u2019s binder, Cosmopolitan seeks to clothe itself with any rights which Higgins, as plaintiff in the personal injury action, might have had under different circumstances. <em>(Allstate Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., </em>368 F. 2d 121; <em>Mexico </em>v. <em>Hoffman, </em>324 U. S. 30; <em>Mahnich </em>v. <em>Southern S. S. Co., </em>321 U.

The record fully supports the trial court\u2019s determination and that of the court below that neither Buhler nor Riva was guilty of any fraud against Cosmopolitan and Cosmopolitan failed to sustain its burden of proof with respect to such a cause of action. <em>(Sebring </em>v. <em>Fidelity Phenix Fire Ins. Co., </em>255 N. Y. 382; <em>Stecker </em>v. <em>American Home Fire Assur. Co., </em>299 N.

The waiver and estoppel of which Cosmopolitan was found to be guilty by the trial court and by the Appellate Division has nothing at all to do Avith Cosmopolitan\u2019s knoAvledge of Lumbermen\u2019s binder. Cosmopolitan\u2019s argument would appear to cast its argument of waiver and estoppel on its knowledge of such a binder. This is a new contention Avhich falls of its OAvn weight. However, the trial court correctly found (and the Appellate Division correctly affirmed the finding) that, if Cosmopolitan had established any fraud on the part of Riva and Buhler, Cosmopolitan\u2019s knowledge and its conduct Avith respect to those parties constituted a Avaiver and an estoppel against it. <em>(Duggan </em>v. <em>Plats, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>263 N.

Upon a settlement in favor of the injured third party, in the amount of $70,000, each of the two carriers and the City of New York contributed one third. Neither Cosmopolitan nor Lumbermen\u2019s admitted liability under their respective policies, and instead stipulated that the outcome of the present action for declaratory judgment would determine which \u2014 or in what amount each \u2014 company was liable.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-5\">On June 1, 1958, 1770 First Avenue Corporation sold Riva Service Corporation its automobile garage business and gave it a 20-year lease of the realty. On June 19, Sharon Higgins was injured in a fall on the sidewalk in front of the premises. 1770 was insured by Cosmopolitan in the amount of $50,000-$100,000 under a policy covering it for the year ending November 15, 1958. Unaware of the Cosmopolitan policy, Riva obtained from Lumbermen\u2019s a 30-day binder for various types of appropriate coverage commencing May 28,1958, within the limits of $100,000-$300,000. In so doing, it acted through its insurance broker, Buhler Service Corporation, which had a broad, general authority to handle Biva\u2019s insurance matters, including freedom to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>select carriers. Buhler, on Biva\u2019s behalf, notified Lumbermen\u2019s of the June 19 accident on June 24. Lumbermen\u2019s thereafter advised Buhler that the risk was unacceptable but extended the 30-day binder to July 13 to enable Biva to obtain other coverage for the future \u2014 which it did.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-4\">Some time later in July, an agent of Cosmopolitan, which was anxious for Riva\u2019s business, informed Buhler about 1770\u2019s policy and advised that Cosmopolitan would \u201cwrite for the new owners of the business \u201d if the necessary permission from 1770 could be obtained. Buhler, accordingly, had Riva obtain permission and wrote Cosmopolitan to change the name of the insured from 1770 to Biva, at the same time \u201c requesting audit to 6/1/1958 date of change of ownership \u201d. Cosmopolitan complied, making the coverage retroactive to June 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-5\">Once Riva was covered by Cosmopolitan, Buhler \u2014 acting under its general authority from Biva and also after consultation with Riva\u2019s president \u2014 \u201c cancelled flat \u201d the Lumbermen\u2019s binder. This means \u2014 at least in the ease of a <em>nonmatured </em>risk \u2014 that the binder is cancelled from its inception without any premiums being collected. It is from this cancellation that the controversy between Cosmopolitan and Lumbermen\u2019s springs.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-6\">In November, 1958 Riva received a claim letter from Miss Higgins\u2019 attorney and forwarded it to Buhler which in turn forwarded it to Cosmopolitan. Cosmopolitan was thus made aware of the June 19, 1958 accident in November of that year. In February, 1961 Cosmopolitan learned of the Lumbermen\u2019s binder and in September, 1961 brought the present action for a declaratory judgment, contending that, by reason of Riva\u2019s concealment of a material fact, it was not liable to Biva on its policy and that Lumbermen\u2019s was liable to defend Biva under its 30-day binder, which it claimed was in effect on the day of the accident. On January 18,1962, the 1770 Corporation brought an action for a declaratory judgment that Cosmopolitan was its insurer under the original policy and the two declaratory judgment actions were consolidated.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-7\">The court at Special Term, New York County, properly found that both Cosmopolitan and Lumbermen\u2019s were on the risk at the time of the accident. Since Lumbermen\u2019s coverage was in twice the amount of Cosmopolitan\u2019s, the court further concluded that, under the terms of both policies and as between the two <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>insurers, Lumbermen\u2019s was <em>to </em>be charged with two thirds of the total $46,666.66 owed by the two companies \u2014 or $31,111.10 \u2014 and Cosmopolitan with one third, or $15,555.55. Accordingly, the court ruled that, since each party had contributed $23,333.33, Cosmopolitan was entitled to be reimbursed from Lumbermen\u2019s to the extent of $7,777.78.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-4\">Upon appeal by both parties, the Appellate Division modified and granted judgment against Cosmopolitan and in favor of Lumbermen\u2019s for the entire $46,666.66. The unanimous court erroneously declared that, because Buhler had authority from Biva to substitute Cosmopolitan\u2019s binder for Lumbermen\u2019s, Lumbermen\u2019s retroactive cancellation \u201c flat \u201d of its Biva policy was to be given effect as against Cosmopolitan.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-5\">An insured and an insurer are, of course, free to agree upon the \u201c cancellation flat\u201d of a binder before matured risk and, so long as the rights of <em>no </em>third party are affected (cf., e.g., <em>Aetna Cas. &amp; Sur. Co. </em>v. <em>O\u2019Connor, </em>8 N Y 2d 359, 364 [1960]); <em>Lauritano </em>v. <em>American Fid. Fire Ins. Co., </em>3 A D 2d 564, 567-568 [1st Dept, 1957], affd. 4 N Y 2d 1028 [1958]), there is no reason why an insured may not effectively cancel \u20181 flat \u2019 \u2019 even after the occurrence of an insurable accident. This is not, however, what happened in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-6\">When Buhler notified Lumbermen\u2019s of the accident and Lumbermen\u2019s assigned an investigator to the claim and opened a file pertaining to the accident, the risk assumed pursuant to the binder had fully matured into a responsibility. And since Cosmopolitan had no right to disclaim liability for the accident because (1) it deliberately assumed the insurance of Riva retroactively to June 1, 1958, and (2) no fraudulent misrepresentation was found by the courts below on the part of either Riva, the insured, or on the part of Buhler, its agent, Cosmopolitan was \u201c on the risk \u201d as of the June 19 accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-7\">It is clear that Lumbermen\u2019s, while it was the only insurance carrier protecting the insured, could not have effectively can-celled the binder insofar as the injured party was concerned after June 19, the date of the accident. The right of Higgins, the injured party, to proceed against Lumbermen\u2019s had fully matured at that time. Similarly, the endorsement by Cosmopolitan on August 7, 1958 on the policy issued to 1770 First Avenue Corporation could not have released Lumbermen\u2019s from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>its liability for the accident occurring' during the period of coverage, since Cosmopolitan\u2019s coinsurance clause limited any liability it would incur to its proportional share. Accordingly, on the date of the accident the two carriers were coinsurers, and Riva could only release Lumbermen\u2019s from the obligation owing under its coinsurance clause if Riva was prepared to take the place of Lumbermen\u2019s as coinsurer with Cosmopolitan, a third party neither involved nor consulted as to the cancellation agreement. Riva, of course, did not expressly agree to assume any obligation incurred by Lumbermen\u2019s during the period the binder was in effect and, in this suit for declaratory judgment between the two insurers, it cannot be inferred that Riva intended to take Lumbermen\u2019s place and assume its proportionate share of the loss. Any such determination between Riva and Lumbermen\u2019s can only be reached after a trial of these issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-4\">As indicated, we do not question that, after the risk had matured, Riva could have voluntarily relinquished its rights against Lumbermen\u2019s but, insofar as Cosmopolitan\u2019s obligation to Riva is concerned, it could not be increased by Riva\u2019s subsequently agreeing to cancel Lumbermen\u2019s binder <em>ab initia. </em>As affecting Cosmopolitan\u2019s liability to Riva, Riva could not alter it <em>nunc pro tune </em>any more than a court can \u2018 \u2018 record a fact as of a prior date when it did not then exist. \u2019 \u2019 <em>(Guaranty Trust &amp; Safe Deposit Co. </em>v. <em>Philadelphia, R. &amp; N. E. R. R. Co., </em>160 N. Y. 1, 7 [1899]; <em>Merrick </em>v. <em>Merrick, </em>266 N. Y. 120, 122 [1934].)</p>\n<p id=\"b191-5\">Thus when Cosmopolitan issued its policy, including the standard coinsurance clause, which occurred before the purported cancellation between Lumbermen\u2019s and Riva, Cosmopolitan\u2019s liability for the loss amounted to its proportionate share, or $15,555.55, as the trial court properly found. Between the two carriers, then, Cosmopolitan is liable only for this amount, and Lumbermen\u2019s for its proportionate share, or $31,111.10. This determination is not meant to intimate, however, any opinion as to any controversy between Lumbermen\u2019s and Riva based upon the cancellation \u201c flat \u201d of the Lumbermen\u2019s binder. The result of this declaratory judgment is only to determine the respective rights as between the two carriers.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-6\">The order of the Appellate Division should be reversed, and the judgment of the Supreme Court, New York County, reinstated, with costs in this court and in the Appellate Division.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>Judges Van Voorhis, Scileppi and Keating concur with Judge Burke; Chief Judge Full and Judge Bergan dissent and vote to affirm upon the opinion at the Appellate Division; Judge Breitel, taking no part.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-5\">Order reversed, etc.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
