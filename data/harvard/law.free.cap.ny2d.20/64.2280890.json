The court, by a tight, narrow and restricted interpretation of the meaning of the word \u201cknow\u201d in section 1120 of the Penal Law, limited the jury\u2019s function in a most unrealistic and improper fashion so that the jury was constrained to find defendant guilty, although the People had failed to establish beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant knew his act was wrong. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Kelly, </em>302 N. Y. 512; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Freeman, </em>357 F. 2d 606; <em>People </em>v. <em>Wood, </em>12 N Y 2d 69; <em>Miranda </em>v. <em>Arizona, </em>384 U. S. 436.) II. Defendant was denied a fair trial on the issue of insanity. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Roth, </em>11 N Y 2d 80; <em>People </em>v. <em>Esposito, </em>287 N.

The court usurped the province of the jury and substituted its own interpretation of the facts and the application of the law to such facts. IV. The public hostility then existent in the County of Queens and throughout the City of New York, fanned as it was by the daily reams of publicity, created an atmosphere wherein it was impossible for the jury to objectively evaluate the evidence presented to it. <em>(Sheppard </em>v. <em>Maxwell, </em>384 U. S. 333.) V. The recess ordered by the court after the finding of the verdict on June 11, 1964 and before the taking of testimony on June 15, 1964 as to the question of sentence deprived defendant of due process of law. VI. It was error for the court to deny the motion made by defendant to set aside the verdict on the grounds that the admissions were obtained from defendant in violation of his constitutional rights, privileges and immunities. <em>(Escobedo </em>v. <em>Illinois, </em>378 U. S. 478.) VII. It was grave, prejudicial error for the court to prohibit the defense from producing evidence of defendant\u2019s mental condition at the time of the commission of these crimes for the purpose of mitigating the seriousness thereof. VIII. The charge of the court as to unanimity of their verdict was erroneous and fatal to defendant. IX. Subdivision 4 of section 1045-a of the Penal Law is unconstitutional and it was error for the court to charge the jury as to the possible release on parole of a person sentenced to life imprisonment.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b103-4\"><em>Thomas J.

Pursuant to section 1045-a of the Penal Law, a separate proceeding was thereafter held before the same jury to determine whether defendant should be sentenced to life imprisonment or death. The jury recommended the death penalty and this sentence was imposed by the trial court on July 6, 1964. A direct appeal to this court was taken under section 517 (subd. 1) of the Code of Criminal Procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-6\">Defendant is accused of killing, robbing, and attempting to rape Katherine Genovese in the early morning of March 13, 1964. While defendant pleaded \u201c not guilty \u201d and \u201c not guilty by reason of insanity \u2019 \u2019, his only defense at trial was insanity and no attempt was made to dispute his commission of the crime. At the time of arrest, he had confessed in full to the killing and entered no objection to the introduction of this confession at trial. Defendant also took the stand and repeated his admissions in detail. On this appeal, he argues that the trial court, which gave the traditional \u2018 \u2018 right-wrong \u2019 \u2019 charge to the jury on the issue of defendant\u2019s insanity (Penal Law, \u00a7 1120), should have instructed the jury that the statutory phrase <em>\u201c </em>to know \u201d that the act <em>\u201c </em>was wrong \u201d means <em>\u201c \u2018 </em>to know in depth \u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>so as to be capable of logically or rationally directing one\u2019s actions or activities Alternatively, defendant contends that the trial court erred when it refused to admit medical testimony on defendant\u2019s mental condition at the section 1045-a (sentencing) proceeding. This testimony was offered in mitigation of the defendant\u2019s offense but the trial court excluded it on the ground that the jury had already found defendant to be legally sane and that, therefore, \u201c that issue [could not] be relitigated The trial court also wrote a memorandum opinion on this point (43 Misc 2d 505).</p>\n<p id=\"b105-5\">With respect to the issue of defendant\u2019s sanity, it is concluded that under section 1120 and the applicable precedents, the jury was properly charged and the People proved beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant knew it was wrong to kill Katherine Genovese. The trial court, however, committed substantial error in holding that evidence as to defendant\u2019s mental condition was inadmissible at the sentencing hearing. Defendant was not attempting to relitigate the issue of his legal insanity or his criminal responsibility; instead he was quite properly endeavoring to persuade the jury that, while \u2018 \u2018 legally sane \u2019 \u2019, his mental illness, while not a defense to the crime, may have rendered it impossible for him to exercise any self-control, and should, therefore, be considered in mitigation. The matter should be remanded to the trial court which must then impose the sentence of life imprisonment upon defendant (Penal Law, \u00a7 1045-a, subd. 6).</p>\n<p id=\"b105-6\">After the jury returned a verdict of murder in the first degree the sentencing phase of the trial was held four days later. At that time, the People introduced evidence of \u201c aggravating * * * circumstances \u201d through the testimony of five women. Four of the women identified defendant as the man who had either assaulted, sodomized, robbed, raped, or attempted to rape them. A fifth witness corroborated certain details of a murder to which defendant had confessed at the first phase of the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-8\">Counsel for defendant then indicated that they wished to recall two of the psychiatrists to testify in mitigation of the sentence, particularly on the point that, for the purposes of fixing the penalty, the jury should be informed that there is a distinction between \u201clegal insanity \u201d (as defined by \u00a7 1120) and \u201c medical <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>insanity \u2019 The trial court held that it would not permit such testimony: \u201c It would make a farce of the law to hold that upon the trial proper in the first stage, insanity meant one thing, and upon the question of punishment it meant something else. This Court \u2014 this jury has determined that for all legal purposes, all legal purposes, this defendant is not insane within the meaning of the law. I will not permit that issue to be relitigated.\u201d The defendant took an exception and rested without producing any evidence. During summation, defendant\u2019s counsel referred to \u201c insanity\u201d and the court interrupted and said: \u201cThere\u2019s no insanity in this case. Please refrain from mentioning that again. They passed on that.\u201d Thereupon, counsel terminated his summation.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-5\">As defendant argues, a finding of legal sanity should not estop him from producing evidence at the sentencing hearing that he is \u201cmedically insane\u201d. Certainly, the pertinent subdivision of the statute (\u00a7 1045-a) is broad enough to include such evidence: \u201c3. In such proceeding, evidence may be presented by either party on any matter relevant to sentence including, but not limited to, the nature and circumstances of the crime, defendant\u2019s background and history, and any aggravating or mitigating circumstances. Any relevant evidence, not legally privileged, shall be received regardless of its admissibilty under the exclusionary rules of evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b106-6\">Commenting on the breadth of the language in this subdivision, the Commission on Revision of the Penal Law and Criminal Code (which drafted the legislation) stated in its memorandum in support of the bill that the \u2018\u00a3 aggravating \u2019 \u2019 and \u00a3 1 mitigating \u201d evidence should be similar to that found in a \u201c presentence investigation report\u201d (N. Y. Legis. Annual, 1963, p. 75; see <em>People </em>v. <em>Dusublon, </em>16 N Y 2d 9, 18). Moreover, the Model Penal Code, one of the sources for the New York statute, specifies that evidence concerning the defendant\u2019s \u201c mental <em>* * * </em>condition \u201d may be introduced in this proceeding and also includes under its listing of possible \u00a3 <em>\u2018 </em>Mitigating circumstances \u2019 \u2019 the fact that the \u00a3 <em>1 </em>murder was committed while the defendant was under the influence of extreme mental or emotional disturbance \u201d (Model Penal Code, \u00a7 201.6, subds. [2], [4], pars, [b], [g]. Compare the Pennsylvania statute limiting the evidence which can be considered at the sentencing hearing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>to evidence which was not introduced at the first trial. Penn. Ann. Stat., tit. 18, \u00a7 4701.) See, also, <em>People </em>v. <em>Rivera </em>(16 N Y 2d 546) in which it was assumed that the jury in a section 1045-a proceeding was entitled to consider evidence introduced at the sentencing hearing on the defendant\u2019s medical condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-4\">California also has a bifurcated proceeding in capital cases which is governed by a statute similar to section 1045-a and in <em>People v. Bickley </em>(57 Cal. 2d 788) the California Supreme Court touched on the distinction between \u201clegal\u201d and \u201cmedical\u201d insanity. The defendant in <em>BicJcley </em>initially entered a plea of not guilty by reason of insanity and was examined by two court-appointed \u201c alienists \u201d who found him sane. Defendant then withdrew the plea and was found guilty at the first trial. The State introduced the testimony of the examining alienists at the sentencing proceeding and defendant objected on the grounds that it was \u201c irrelevant \u201d because he had abandoned his insanity plea. On appeal, the court held that the testimony was relevant: \u2018 \u2018 While, by withdrawing the plea of insanity after the court had already appointed the experts and they had already examined him, the appellant removed the issue of sanity from the guilt phase of the trial, because sanity then was no longer material or relevant to that phase of the trial, sanity, in the sense of mental condition, was still at issue on the penalty phase, and was obviously material and relevant on that phase of the trial. Mental condition is one of the facts relating to appellant\u2019s \u2018 background and history \u2019 and is a fact \u2018 in aggravation or mitigation of the penalty\u2019 as those terms are used in section 190.1\u201d (57 Cal. 2d, supra, p. 792).</p>\n<p id=\"b107-5\">Similarly, it may have been irrelevant at the main trial in this case whether or not defendant could control his actions. But there is no reason in logic or justice why the jury could not consider such evidence as a \u201c mitigating \u201d circumstance in fixing his penalty. An entirely different issue was involved at the sentencing proceeding \u2014 not the criminal responsibility of defendant which had already been decided under the traditional and arguably archaic <em>McNaughton </em>rule, but whether anything concerning the \u201cdefendant\u2019s background and history\u201d might move the jury to extend mercy. On this issue, the conclusions of two of the psychiatrists (as supported by the defendant\u2019s conduct and his own testimony) that defendant was suffering <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>from a grave mental illness which, rendered it impossible for him to control his bestial actions would clearly have been relevant.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b108-4\">Upon remand to the trial court, there must be an automatic sentence of life imprisonment for defendant. Subdivision 6 of section 1045-a provides: \u201c6. On an appeal by the defendant where the judgment is of death, the court of appeals, if it finds substantial error only in the sentencing proceeding, may set aside the sentence of death and remand the case to the trial court, in which event the trial court shall impose the sentence of life imprisonment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b108-5\">Accordingly, the judgment should be reversed and the matter remanded to the Supreme Court for imposition of a sentence of life imprisonment pursuant to subdivision 6 of section 1045-a of the Penal Law.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-6\">Chief Judge Fuld and Judges Vah Voorhis, Burke, Scileppi, Bergan and Keating concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-7\">Judgment of conviction reversed to the extent that the sentence of death is set aside and the case remanded to the Supreme Court, Queens County, for imposition of a sentence of life imprisonment, pursuant to subdivision 6 of section 1045-a of the Penal Law.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b108-12\"> While it is true that the jury heard this evidence at the first trial, the trial court stated at the sentencing hearing, after interrupting the summation of defense counsel, that <em>\u201c </em>There\u2019s no insanity in this case.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
