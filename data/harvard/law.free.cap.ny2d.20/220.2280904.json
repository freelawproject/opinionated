He moved to dismiss the indictment and to transfer the case to the Family Court. His motion was denied and he pleaded guilty to the misdemeanor of assault in the third degree; he received a suspended sentence. His conviction was affirmed by the Appellate Division and, upon this appeal, the sole question presented is whether a County Court may try an indictment accusing a husband of feloniously assaulting his wife without having first transferred the proceeding to the Family Court for an initial determination whether the assault should be there disposed of as a \u201c family offense \u201d or transferred to the County Court for prosecution as a crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-7\">The new state-wide Family Court was created in 1962 to replace the Domestic Relations Court of the City of New York and the Children\u2019s Courts in the other 57 counties of the State. This was accomplished as part of the general reorganization of our courts and the establishment of a unified court system through amendment of the New York State Constitution (art. VI), effective September 1, 1962. With respect to the Family Court, section 13 (subd. b) of article VI recites that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b260-8\">\u201c The family court shall have jurisdiction over the following classes of actions and proceedings which <em>shall be originated </em>in such family court * * * (7) as may be provided by law: * * * <em>crimes and offenses </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>by or against minors or <em>between spouses </em>or between parent and child or between members of the same family or household.\u201d (Italics supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b261-4\">Implementing this constitutional provision, section 811 of article 8 of the Family Court Act \u2014 entitled \u201c Family Offenses Proceedings\u2019\u2019 \u2014 declares that the purpose of the article is to \u201ccreate a civil proceeding for dealing with\u201d family offenses, since the persons involved are usually seeking <em>11 </em>not * * * a criminal conviction and punishment but practical help \u2019 \u2019 and the Family Court is \u201cbetter equipped to render such help\u201d. Accordingly, section 812 gives the Family Court</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b261-6\">\u201c <em>exclusive original jurisdiction </em>over any proceeding concerning acts which would constitute disorderly conduct or an assault between spouses \u201d.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> (Italics supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b261-7\">We find no merit in the People\u2019s contention that the coupling of \u201c assault between spouses \u201d with \u201c disorderly conduct \u201d confines the jurisdiction of the Family Court to \u201c simple \u201d assaults. The Constitution, it is to be borne in mind, gives the Legislature the power to vest in the Family Court, without qualification, jurisdiction over all \u201c crimes and offenses \u201d between spouses (N. Y. Const., art. VI, \u00a7 13, subd. b). We conclude that, by use of the statutory language, 11 disorderly conduct or an assault \u2019 \u2019, the Legislature simply intended to limit the specific \u2018 <em>\u2018 </em>crime's and offenses \u201d to be heard by the Family Court to certain types of violence. The statutory phrase, \u201c an assault between spouses \u201d, (\u00a7 812) as broad enough to include any assault, felonious as well as petty.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-8\">The Family Court is not, of course, to retain jurisdiction in every case of an intrafamilial assault. As the statute makes clear, \u201cIf the family court concludes that these processes are inappropriate in a particular case, it is authorized to transfer the proceedings to an appropriate criminal court \u201d (\u00a7 811; also \u00a7 816). There is little danger that truly criminal conduct will be treated as a \u201c family offense \u201d rather than a crime and go unpunished. An order of the Family Court which denies trans<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>fer of the family offense proceeding to a criminal court is subject to review (Family Ct. Act, \u00a7 1012; see <em>People </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>27 A D 2d 299, 305) and will undoubtedly be reversed if the retention of the case constitutes an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-4\">It is evident that careful thought was given by the Legislature to the question of the Family Court\u2019s jurisdiction over family assaults before the decision was made to include all such assaults and not simply those which were trivial. Although the Judicial Conference had recommended, several years before the creation of the Family Court, that the proposed \u201c Family Court should have jurisdiction over * * * Crimes and offenses, <em>except felonies, </em>by or against children or between spouses \u201d (Fourth Annual Report of N. Y. Judicial Conference, 1959, pp. 89-90; italics supplied), neither the Judiciary Article of the Constitution nor the Family Court Act so limited the court\u2019s jurisdiction; the exclusionary words, \u201c except felonies \u201d, were significantly omitted. And, as a matter of fact, the Judicial Conference unequivocally declared in 1963 that <em>\u201c </em>The jurisdiction of the Family Court is not limited to any particular degree of assault.\u201d (Eighth Annual Report of N. Y. Judicial Conference, 1963, p. 72; see, also, Goldberg and Lauer, The Family Court Act, McKinney\u2019s Cons. Laws of N. Y., Book 29A, Judiciary Law, Pt. I, p. xxxii.)</p>\n<p id=\"b262-6\">Furthermore, a bill was introduced in 1964 (S. Int. 2346, Pr. 2446) which, in terms, limited the exclusive original jurisdiction of the Family Court to acts constituting an assault in the third degree and thus excluded felonious assaults from its jurisdiction \u2014 as they had also been excluded from the jurisdiction of the former Children\u2019s Court of the State of New York (Children\u2019s Ct. Act, \u00a7 6, subd. 4) and the former Domestic Relations Court of the City of New York (N. Y. City Dom. Rel. Ct. Act, \u00a7 61, .subd. 2). The bill which passed both houses of the Legislature \u2014 though vetoed by the Governor (see <em>People </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>27 A D 2d 299, 304, <em>supra)</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>\u2014 thus reflects clear legislative recognition that, as the law now stands, the Family Court has jurisdiction over felonious assaults.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-10\">The district attorney, taking a contrary stand, argues that our interpretation of the Constitution and the statute undermines <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>the constitutional powers given to the grand jury to \u201c inquire \u201d into crimes and \u201c originate charges against those \u201d believed to have committed them. (N. Y. Const., art. I, \u00a7 6; Code Crim. Pro., \u00a7\u00a7 223, 245, 252, 253; see, also, <em>People </em>v. <em>Stern, </em>3 N Y 2d 658, 661; <em>People </em>v. <em>Ryback, </em>3 N Y 2d 467; <em>People ex rel. Livingston </em>v. <em>Wyatt, </em>186 N. Y. 383, 391-392.) However, since an act does not become a \u2018 <em>\u2018 </em>crime \u2019 \u2019 until the Legislature defines it as such (Penal Law, \u00a7 22; see <em>People </em>v. <em>Scopas, </em>11 N Y 2d 120, 123; <em>People </em>v. <em>Horton, </em>308 N. Y. 1, 9; cf. <em>People </em>v. <em>Stern, </em>3 N Y 2d 658, 661, <em>supra), </em>the Legislature may properly provide, as it did in the present instance, that a \u201c family offense \u201d was' not to be prosecuted as a \u201c crime \u201d until the Family Court judge so determined. (See, e.g., <em>People </em>v. <em>De Jesus, </em>21 A D 2d 236, 241.) Legislative exclusion from penal sanctions of acts which would otherwise be regarded as criminal is not without precedent. For instance, section 2186 of the Penal Law recites that \u2018 \u2018 A child of more than seven and less than sixteen years of age, who shall commit an act or omission which, if committed by an adult, would be a crime, shall not be deemed guilty of any crime, but of juvenile delinquency only\u201d. No one disputes that the grand jury is powerless to indict a child between the ages of 7 and 16. (See, e.g., <em>People </em>v. <em>Stevenson, </em>17 N Y 2d 682.) The Family Court Act has a similar impact on the scope of the powers which may be exercised by the grand jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-4\">Section 6 of article I of the Constitution recites that \u201cNo person shall be held to answer for a capital or other infamous crime * * * unless on indictment of a grand jury \u201d. Quite obviously, this provision was designed not to enhance the prerogatives of the grand jury but, rather, to protect individuals from unfounded accusations of crime. The Family Court Act simply provides more protection to the individual by removing domestic quarrels from the ambit of the criminal law. Accordingly, it may not be said that this salutary policy violates section 6 of article I. As the Appellate Division observed in <em>People </em>v. <em>De Jesus </em>(21 A D 2d, at p. 241), \u201c any other constitutional or legislative provision that affords additional safeguards and protection to an accused is clearly not in conflict [with article I, section 6]. Therefore, when the Family Court Act says, in effect, that a family offense shall not be treated as a crime until a Family Court Judge has so determined, it cannot <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>be said Lliat this in any way harms anyone who is within the protective scope of section 6 of article I of the New York State Constitution.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b264-4\">By the same token, the interpretation accorded the Family Court Act does not impair the constitutional powers granted the county courts \u2018 \u2018 over all crimes and other violations of law \u2019 \u2019 (art. VI, \u00a7 11) or the constitutional provision that the \u201c county court may transfer any action or proceeding, except a criminal action or proceeding involving a felony prosecuted by indictment <em>* * </em>* <em>to </em>any court\u201d (art. VI, \u00a7 19). Since, as indicated, a family offense does not become an indictable crime until the Family Court judge so decides, it does not, initially, come within the jurisdiction of the County Court, except for the limited purposes outlined in section 813.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> That being so, the County Court must, where such exceptions do not obtain, transfer a family assault case to the Family Court in accordance with the constitutional mandate that \u201c The county court shall transfer to the * * * family court any action or proceeding * * * over which the county court has no jurisdiction \u201d (N. Y. Const., art. VI, \u00a7 19, subd. b).</p>\n<p id=\"b264-6\">In short, then, the Family Court has jurisdiction to deal, in the first instance, with family offenses, including any complaint of assault, felonious or simple, \u201cbetween spouses or between parent and child or between members of the same family \u2019 \u2019 (N. Y. Const., art. VI, \u00a7 13, subd. b). Plainly expressing its design that the Family Court have priority of examination into family offenses, the Legislature has provided a procedure both for enforcement of that priority and for surrender of the court\u2019s jurisdiction where appropriate. That procedure was mandatory here. Upon the defendant\u2019s motion, the County Court should have transferred the matter to the Family Court to enable that tribunal to determine, initially, whether it should itself deal with the spouses before it or return the case to the criminal court.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-7\">The judgment of conviction should be reversed, the indictment dismissed and the matter transferred to the Family Court of Nassau County for proceedings in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>Judges Van Voorhis, Burke, Scileppi, Bergan, Keating and Breitel concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-4\">Judgment reversed, indictment dismissed and case remanded to Nassau County Court with directions to transfer the matter to the Family Court of Nassau County for proceedings in accordance with the opinion herein.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b261-9\">. And, in subdivision (a) of section 813, it is further provided that any criminal complaint charging such disorderly conduct or assault between spouses \u201cshall be transferred by the criminal court * * * to the family court\u201d,</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b262-11\">.

In addition to providing for the transfer of the case to the Family Court, section 813 authorizes the criminal court to dismiss a complaint for legal insufficiency or allow the complainant to withdraw it.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
