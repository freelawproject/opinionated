The trial court\u2019s failure to conduct a hearing to determine if appellant was mentally competent to stand trial rendered his conviction and sentencing an unconstitutional deprivation of liberty without due process of law. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Smyth, </em>3 N Y 2d 184; <em>People </em>v. <em>Blando, </em>23 A D 2d 761; <em>People </em>v. <em>Lluveras, </em>19 A D 2d 525; <em>Pate </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>383 U.

II. Appellant was convicted in violation of his constitutional right to counsel. Appellant was not informed of his right to court-appointed counsel before he waived a preliminary hearing. <em>(People </em>v. <em>White, </em>18 Misc 2d 56; <em>White </em>v. <em>Maryland, </em>373 U.

Appellant was denied his right to counsel when making his post-verdict motions. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Koch, </em>299 N. Y. 378.) V. The defense of insanity should have been charged. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Lluveras, </em>19 A D 2d 525; <em>Dancy v. United States, 361 </em>F. 2d 75; <em>Cross v. United States, </em>354 F. 2d 512.) VI. As there was evidence that appellant lacked a specific intent to commit grievous bodily harm the trial court should have charged the elements of assault in the third degree. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Mussenden, </em>308 N. Y. 558; <em>People </em>v. <em>Hall, </em>12 A D 2d 815.) VII. The trial court committed reversible error by denying the timely motion to dismiss and charging there was no dispute concerning an element of the crime. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Fields, </em>174 Misc. 309; <em>People </em>v. <em>Burch, </em>281 App. Div. 348; <em>People </em>v. <em>Grass, </em>79 Misc. 457; <em>People </em>v. <em>Marks, </em>146 App. Div. 11; <em>People </em>v. <em>Kielczewski, </em>269 Ill. 293; <em>Watson </em>v. <em>State, </em>236 Ind. 329; <em>People </em>v. <em>Walker, </em>198 N.

Defendant was improperly sentenced as a multiple offender. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Walker, </em>198 N. Y. 329; <em>People ex rel. Carr </em>v. <em>Brophy, </em>287 N.

Hubbard </em>v. <em>LaVallee, </em>14 A D 2d 932.) V. The court was not required, on its own motion, to submit the crime of assault in the third degree to the jury as a lesser included offense. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Wood, </em>10 A D 2d 231.) VI. Defendant was properly sentenced as a prior felony offender. <em>(People ex rel. Carr </em>v. <em>Brophy, </em>287 N. Y. 588; <em>People </em>v. <em>Heath, </em>237 App. Div. 209; <em>People </em>v. <em>Coleman, </em>237 App. Div. 211.) VII. The judgment, as corrected, imposed on defendant for his possession of a pistol conforms with the verdict.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b329-5\">Keating, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AiY\">The defendant, Domingo Gonzalez, Avas the father of an illegitimate child, who had been surrendered by her mother to the Welfare Department. Gonzalez attempted to obtain custody of his daughter, but the Welfare Department was opposed to this. On the trial of Gonzalez for assault in the second degree, it was testified that he Avent to the office of the Welfare Department and, pointing a gun at a patrolman in the office, told him to put up his hands and demanded to be taken to the Commissioner. He stated at this time that he Avanted his child.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-6\">On arraignment in the Criminal Court the day after the crime, Gonzalez was committed for psychiatric examination. The psychiatric report to the court noted that, although he had a \u201crelatively intact facade\u201d, defendant showed a \u201cserious impairment in his thinking <em>* </em>* * characterized by many paranoid trends \u201d, The report concluded that \u201c Hospitalization is strongly recommended \u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-8\">On the basis of this report, defendant Avas admitted to MattcaAvan State Hospital where he remained for some 10 months, after Avhich he was released and the criminal prosecution A\\as resumed. At the trial, defendant insisted on trying his OAvn case and refused the services of assigned counsel, although counsel was present and, to the extent permitted, helped him. No plea of insanity was interposed, and, in fact, defendant on the trial insisted that he Avas quite sane.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-9\">Before the trial began, the Trial Judge directed another psychiatric examination to determine defendant\u2019s mental ability <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>to be tried. The report of the psychiatrists was guarded. They concluded that defendant \u201c is not psychotic in the legal sense \u201d and, therefore, they felt \u201che is able to stand trial and defend himself adequately at the present time \u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-4\">Again, the curious and very guarded phrase is used: \u2018 <em>\u2018 </em>Thus, in the legal sense, we would not consider him insane.\u201d There follows some significant comment: \u201c From a purely psychiatric point of view, however, we would consider him an individual whose personality has become sufficiently altered and aberrant to warrant a diagnosis of psychiatric abnormality which is probably best described as a Paranoid State. We would consider this to be only in partial remission at this time.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b330-5\">This would seem, on the face of it, to suggest that defendant was then insane in a psychiatric sense but not a \u201c purely \u201d legal sense. This is strikingly similar to the diagnosis of 10 months before when he was mentally ill enough to be committed to Matteawan, i.e., he \u201c presents serious impairment in his thinking \u2019 \\</p>\n<p id=\"b330-6\">The Judge accepted the written report of the psychiatrists without conducting a hearing on the question of defendant\u2019s mental capacity to be tried. The opening of defendant to the jury repeated almost verbatim some of the statements which defendant had made to psychiatrists which had suggested psychiatric abnormality, particularly his obsessive sense of injustice in not obtaining custody of his child.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-7\">After the verdict of guilty and before sentence, the Judge directed a further psychiatric examination to determine the defendant\u2019s ability to understand the proceedings against him. The psychiatric report resulting from this third examination was rather similar to the others. There is still a persistent preoccupation \u201cwith gaining the custody of his daughter\u201d. Improvement in his mental condition is indicated, but if he is released to the community \u201cit is likely that he will require assistance and supervision\u201d. The diagnosis (\u201cImpression\u201d) is \u2018 \u2018 Without psychosis; schizophrenic reaction; Paranoid Type, in remission He \u201c is not in such a state of idiocy \u201d, etc., as to \u201c be incapable of understanding the charge \u201d, etc.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-8\">This appeal presents two questions for our consideration. The first is whether the Trial Judge <em>sua sponte </em>should have conducted a hearing as to the defendant\u2019s mental capacity at the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>time of the trial. Second, irrespective of the question of the defendant\u2019s sanity at <em>that </em>time, whether the Trial Judge should have charged the jury on the question of the defendant\u2019s sanity at the time of the commission of the crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-4\">The written psychiatric report of the defendant\u2019s condition as the trial began and the statements and attitudes of the defendant in undertaking the trial alone should have impelled the trial court <em>sua sponte </em>to order a hearing on the issue of the defendant\u2019s competence to stand trial. <em>(Pate </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>383 U. S. 375, 378.) Clearly, the defendant is now entitled to a hearing on that issue. We conclude, however, that a complete new trial of the issue of guilt or innocence is not mandated. We consider below the two stages of defendant\u2019s alleged insanity.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-5\">I. <em>Sanity at the Time of Trial</em></p>\n<p id=\"b331-6\">In <em>People </em>v. <em>Hudson </em>(19 N Y 2d 137) we interpreted the rule laid down by <em>Pate </em>v. <em>Robinson (supra). </em>In <em>Pate </em>the Supreme Court held that a new trial was mandated since \u201c expert witnesses would have to testify solely from information contained in the printed record. That Robinson\u2019s hearing would be held six years after the fact aggravates these difficulties.\u201d <em>(Pate </em>v. <em>Robinson, supra, </em>p. 387.) The court in <em>Pate </em>found that it would be virtually impossible to determine Robinson\u2019s sanity at the time of trial solely from the printed record. We distinguished <em>Hudson </em>from <em>Pate </em>in this respect on the ground that there was available in <em>Hudson \u2018 \u2018 </em>medical proof related to conditions at the initiation and during the progress of the trial, and of the close observations of witnesses who, from different points of vantage, observed defendant and could describe his conduct, [which] makes it possible to afford a plenary inquiry into his competency at the time of trial. The issue would not here be left, as it was in <em>Pate, </em>to opinions based on reading a printed record. All the safeguards of a concurrent determination Avould thus be preserved.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Hudson, supra, </em>p. 140.)</p>\n<p id=\"b331-7\">The instant case is similar to <em>People </em>v. <em>Hudson </em>in this respect. The trial was conducted in 1964. Presumably, as in <em>Hudson, </em>much more than merely the printed record Avill be available since not only the Avitnesses from the previous trial can testify regarding Gonzalez \u2019 demeanor and conduct but, also, the doctors <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>who examined, him and the Judge can be called upon to testify concerning their observations of Gonzalez.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-4\">Accordingly, under <em>People </em>v. <em>Hudson (supra) </em>a hearing should be held with respect to Gonzalez\u2019 sanity at the time of his trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-5\">II. <em>Sanity at the Time of the Commission of the Crime</em></p>\n<p id=\"b332-6\">Obviously, if it is determined, after the hearing, that Gonzalez was not competent at the time of his trial, he will be entitled to a new trial. It has been suggested, however, that, even if it is concluded that he was sane at the time of his trial, nevertheless the verdict should not stand, because the Trial Judge failed to charge the jury, <em>sua sponte, </em>on the issue of insanity at the time of the commission of the crime. It is significant with respect to this issue that Gonzalez insisted on conducting his own defense. A lawyer was present to aid him to the extent that he permitted this. Gonzalez did not raise the defense of insanity during the trial and, in fact, insisted throughout that he was sane. It seems to us improper to place on a Trial Judge the burden of interposing and charging possible defenses, although not raised on the trial, simply because the defendant has insisted on appearing <em>pro se. </em>If Gonzalez had been represented by an attorney who failed to raise the defense of insanity, it would be simply assumed that he had consulted with his client, who was unprepared to risk being confined to a State mental institution. Where a sane person similarly refuses to raise such a defense on his own behalf, it should ordinarily be assumed that he waived it. We do note, however, that Gonzalez mentioned after the verdict and before sentencing that 1 \u2018 it is illegal to try an ex-mental patient for a crime committed while he was supposed to be mentally ill.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b332-7\">Since the defendant failed to raise this line of defense throughout the trial, this reference to possible insanity at the time of the commission of the crime should not operate to vitiate a verdict rendered on the basis of the defendant\u2019s waiver of this defense. If we were to permit such a statement as quoted above to invalidate a duly rendered verdict simply because the defendant appeared <em>pro se, </em>an unfair discrimination would exist against those defendants who are represented by attorneys. No one would suggest that an attorney, who failed to raise such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>a defense on behalf of his client, could obtain a new trial after the verdict by such a casual reference.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-4\">We are not unmindful of the difficulties presented by defendants who insist on conducting their own defenses. Every effort should be made by both the Judge and the People to ascertain that such a defendant understands the possible avenues of defense which are open to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-5\">In this case, the Judge saw to it that an attorney was present to aid in Gonzalez\u2019 defense. If the trial court had charged insanity over the defendant\u2019s objection, this might have seriously jeopardized his case. The penalty for assault in the second degree is not so serious as to ordinarily risk incarceration in a State mental institution to avoid it.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-6\">Under the circumstances of this case, therefore, it was not improper for the Trial Judge to fail to charge the defense of insanity. Since it \"was error, however, for him not to hold a hearing to determine the defendant\u2019s sanity at the time of the trial, a hearing should be ordered on that issue and, if the defendant\u2019s allegations are substantiated, a new trial ordered. If they are not, the judgment should be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b333-7\">Bergan, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A89\">(concurring in part). There should, of course, as Judge Keatistg has written, at least be a hearing on the question of defendant\u2019s mental capacity at the time of trial. We are of opinion, additionally, that there should be a new trial at which the question of defendant\u2019s sanity at the time of the crime be determined.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-8\">A formal plea of not guilty on the ground of insanity was not interposed, but in the absence of a valid determination under sections 871-876 of the Code of Criminal Procedure that the defendant is competent to conduct his own defense the Trial Judge\u2019s obligation in management of the trial was not measured precisely by the absence of that specification in the plea. Both the psychiatric reports and the actions of the defendant were so suggestive of insanity as to require the Judge to submit to the jury the question of his criminal responsibility for the offense. This course was especially indicated where, in the psychiatric examination immediately following the crime, it was reported to the court there was a \u2018 serious impairment in his thinking\u201d and hospitalization was \u201cstrongly recommended \u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>This early psychiatric analysis, together with the psychiatric report made directly to the Trial Judge; the bizarre and senseless nature of the crime; the obsessive preoccupation of defendant throughout the trial with his right to custody of the child, and his aberrant conduct in the trial, taken together, would require the Judge to submit the question of insanity to the jury. (See <em>Whalem </em>v. <em>United States, </em>346 F. 2d 812, 818, 819, cert. den. 382 U. S. 862; <em>Cross </em>v. <em>United States, </em>354 F. 2d 512, 513.)</p>\n<p id=\"b334-4\">' Beyond this, the Judge ought to have granted a new trial where, prior to sentence, defendant expressly raised the issue of his mental capacity and lack of criminal responsibility (Code Crim. Pro., \u00a7 336).</p>\n<p id=\"b334-5\">A new trial should be ordered.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b334-6\">Scileppi, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AMC\">(dissenting). In the present case, no sanity issue was proffered either on trial or by plea before trial. It cannot be that a question of the defendant\u2019s sanity, whenever and however raised, requires the granting of the relief here awarded. The record indicates that the Trial Judge made extreme efforts to satisfy himself that the defendant possessed sufficient sanity to mount his own defense. Nevertheless, the majority says that there must be a hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-7\">I disagree that the failure to hold a hearing on the defendant\u2019s ability to stand trial warrants reversal. There is nothing .suggestive that such a hearing would have led the Trial Judge to any different result. He was aware of the situation, and had taken steps to assure himself that defendant was sane enough to go on trial. Under these circumstances, a hearing would be surplusage. In <em>Pate </em>v. <em>Robinson </em>(383 U. S. 375), the trial court rejected even the prosecutor\u2019s attempts to introduce relevant psychiatric evidence. In the present case, the defense of insanity was not raised.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-8\">I also disagree with so much of the concurring opinion as indicates that the trial court\u2019s failure to interpose the defense of insanity requires a new trial. The defendant elected to be Ms own lawyer, and tried the case on Ms own theory. An attorney was assigned to render whatever assistance he could. All reasonable precautions were taken to insure a fair and impartial trial.' The concurring opinion, however, says that this is not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>enough. We must go further and require the Trial Judge to abandon his neutrality \u2014 the boast of our legal system \u2014 and assume an advocate\u2019s mantle, presenting defenses omitted, neglected, or rejected by the defendant. This task should not be forced upon any court. In Gonzalez\u2019 case, it might have been appropriate for the defense to rely upon insanity as a defense of confession and avoidance. But some later case may present the dilemma of a defense founded upon alibi and suggestive circumstances indicating that the defense might also rely on insanity to escape criminal liability. Is the court in that case to intrude and interpose the insanity defense? Such unwarranted action by the Trial Judge could well raise the inference that the defendant perpetrated the crime charged, in spite of the defense effort to establish alibi. I do not think the majority could sanction such a result, but I suggest that they have pointed the way.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-4\">The conviction should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-5\">Opinion by Judge Keating. All concur, Judge Bergan concurring in part and voting to order a new trial in a separate opinion in which Chief Judge Fuld and Judge Van Voorhis concur, and except Judge Scileppi, who dissents and votes to affirm in an opinion in which Judge Burke concurs. Judge Breitel taking no part.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-6\">Judgment modified by remanding the case to the Supreme Court, New York County, for further proceedings in accordance with the opinion herein and, as so modified, affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
