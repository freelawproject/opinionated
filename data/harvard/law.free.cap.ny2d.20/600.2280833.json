The trial court denied appellant equal protection of the laws by denying him an opportunity to obtain the transcript of his prior trial. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Repetowski, </em>229 App. Div. 375; <em>Alford </em>v. <em>United States, </em>282 U. S. 687; <em>People </em>v. <em>Ramistella, </em>306 N. Y. 379; <em>People </em>v. <em>Miller, 35 </em>Ill. 2d 615; <em>Peterson </em>v. <em>United States, </em>351 P. 2d 606; <em>State ex rel.

S. 12; <em>Draper </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>372 U. S. 487; <em>Long </em>v. <em>District Ct. of Iowa, 385 </em>U. S. 192.) II. The identification procedure, wherein appellant was required virtually to re-enact the crime, compelled him to be a witness against himself and was fundamentally prejudicial. <em>(Schmerber </em>v. <em>California, </em>384 U. S. 757; <em>State </em>v. <em>Taylor, </em>213 S. C. 330; <em>Beachem </em>v. <em>State, </em>144 Tex. Cr.

III. The identification proceeding, conducted after indictment and in the absence of counsel, denied Ballott his right to counsel. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Waterman, </em>9 N Y 2d 561; <em>Massiah </em>v. <em>United States, </em>377 U.

There is no corroboration of the testimony of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>the accomplice and thus no competent evidence of identity. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>3 A D 2d 967.)</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b640-5\"><em>Thomas J.

It was Avithin the discretion of the trial court to deny appellant\u2019s motion for an adjournment for the purpose of obtaining the minutes of an earlier trial and such denial did not violate appellant\u2019s constitutional rights. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Jackson, </em>111 N. Y. 362; <em>People </em>v. <em>Repetowski, </em>229 App. Div. 375; <em>Peterson </em>v. <em>United States, </em>351 F. 2d 606; <em>People </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>35 Ill. 2d 615; <em>Forsberg </em>v. <em>United States, </em>351 F. 2d 242; <em>Nickens </em>v. <em>United States, </em>323 F. 2d 808, 379 U.

The identification procedure did not violate appellant\u2019s constitutional rights. <em>(United States </em>v. <em>Wade, </em>388 U. S. 218; <em>Gilbert </em>v. <em>California, </em>388 U.

Appellant\u2019s right <em>to </em>counsel was not violated in the identification proceeding. <em>(Massiah </em>v. <em>United States, </em>377 U.

IV. The evidence was legally sufficient to sustain the conviction.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b640-6\">Chief Judge Fum.</author>\n<p id=\"AdV\">FolloAving his second trial \u2014 the first ended in a disagreement \u2014 the defendant Avas convicted of robbery, as well as of related crimes of grand larceny and assault, and sentenced to imprisonment for a term of from 15 to 30 years. He seeks a reversal on \u00edavo grounds, first, that he was improperly denied a copy of the minutes of the prior trial and, second, that the pretrial identification procedure adopted by the police violated his constitutional rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-7\">Miriam Seidman and Bose Scipone Avorked for the M. N. Axim Lumber Company in Queens County. It was the task of those employees, each Friday, to drive to the bank and pick up the company payroll of about $5,000 and then return to the company\u2019s offices Avith the money in an envelope. On the Friday in question, January 18, 1963, as they were about to alight from their car, a Negro, wearing a hat and a heavy overcoat, Avith turned up collar, appeared at the window and demanded the envelope, threatening to shoot if it was not turned oyer to him. Frightened, Mrs. Seidman handed him the envelope and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>Mrs. Scipone gave him her purse containing $27. The robber then fled.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-4\">The defendant was arrested a year later, having been implicated in the robbery by a man named Doyle. The latter, questioned a short time after the robbery, declared that, having learned of the payroll procedure from one of the lumber company\u2019s employees, he and the defendant Ballott had planned the commission of the crime. Doyle pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit larceny, a misdemeanor, and subsequently testified against the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-5\">Mrs. Scipone testified upon the trial that she had not seen the face of the robber and only Mrs. Seidman identified the defendant as the man who had held them up. It was disclosed, during the course of her testimony, that in January, 1964, a year after the robbery, the police had exhibited to her the defendant, alone in a room in the station house, and that she had then stated that he was the person who committed the robbery. It also appeared that she had identified the defendant only after he had, at her request, donned a hat and a heavy coat \u2014\u2022 similar to those worn by the robber \u2014 and uttered the words \u2014 somewhat like those spoken \u2014 \u201c give me the money, give me the envelope \u201d. Mrs. Seidman acknowledged that she made her identification only after she had heard the defendant speak.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-6\">An indictment, returned against the defendant in February, 1964, was dismissed upon the ground that the identification testimony before the Grand Jury was \u201cambiguous\u201d. Another indictment was returned against him some time later and this is the one upon which he has been tried and convicted. The appeal is before us following an affirmance by a closely divided Appellate Division.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-7\">As noted above, the defendant was tried twice. The first trial, in September of 1964, resulted in a jury disagreement and the declaration of a mistrial. After the court set the case down for a new trial, it appeared on the calendar on several days in October and November. On December 7, when it was again called, the defendant requested a postponement in order to obtain the minutes of the earlier trial. The request was granted and the case was put over until February 1, 1965. On that day, the defendant sought a further adjournment of \u201c a week \u201d which, he said, it would take him to raise the money to purchase the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>minutes. He explained that their cost was $300, that he had about $250 and that he needed the extra week to obtain the balance. The court denied the application, observing that he had had \u2018 \u2018 sufficient time <em>\u2019 </em>\u2019 to procure them. The case then proceeded to trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-5\">The defendant asserts that the court\u2019s ruling denied him equal protection of the laws; that he was, in effect, deprived, by reason of his indigency, of his right to confront the witnesses against him with their .prior testimony and to prepare an adequate defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-6\">In a case such as the present \u2014 where the first indictment had been dismissed because of insufficient evidence of identity and the first trial had resulted in a mistrial because the jury had been unable to agree on a verdict \u2014 the defendant\u2019s need for the minutes of the earlier trial is particularly obvious. Under the circumstances, the defense was \u201c entitled \u201d to procure the testimony previously given by the witnesses who were again to testify against him in order to enable him to conduct an effective cross-examination. (See, e.g., <em>People </em>v. <em>Rosario, </em>9 N Y 2d 286, 289; <em>People </em>v. <em>Malinsky, </em>15 N Y 2d 86, 90.) Without such testimony, a defendant is deprived of a substantial right. And, where he is an indigent, the State must make that testimony available to him. (See <em>People v. Montgomery, </em>18 N Y 2d 993; <em>People </em>v. <em>Jaglom, </em>17 N Y 2d 162, 165; <em>Williams </em>v. <em>United States, </em>358 F. 2d 325 [9th Cir.]; <em>Peterson </em>v. <em>United States, </em>351 F. 2d 606 [9th Cir.]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>35 Ill. 2d 615.) Although the defendant did not at the trial expressly claim indigency and demand that the prosecution provide him Avith the minutes, it was evident that he was then financially unable to obtain them. Since this inability resulted in a deprivation of a substantial right, he was denied equal protection of the laws. (See <em>Griffin </em>v. <em>Illinois, </em>351 U. S. 12.)</p>\n<p id=\"b642-7\">However, even if it were to be said that the absence of a specific claim of indigency prevents the defendant from now urging a denial of that constitutional right, there must be a reversal since the trial court\u2019s refusal to grant an adjournment constituted an abuse of discretion as a matter of law. The defendant desired a delay of but a week, solely for the purpose of raising the $50 needed to purchase the minutes of the first trial. He had a fundamental right to the testimony of the Avit<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>nesses who were to testify against him and, surely, one who is attempting to pay for such testimony should be given every reasonable opportunity to do so. Under the circumstances, the court either should have adjourned the case or should have directed that the minutes be transcribed at public expense and furnished to the defendant. Its failure to do one or the other effectively prevented the defendant from exercising his right and was, therefore, an abuse of discretion. (Cf., e.g., <em>People </em>v. <em>Snyder, </em>297 N. Y. 81, 90; <em>People </em>v. <em>McLaughlin, </em>291 N. Y. 480.)</p>\n<p id=\"b643-5\">The defendant also urges that the police station identification procedure was violative of constitutional guarantees and that it rendered Mrs. Seidman\u2019s in-court identification inadmissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-6\">Contrary to one of the defendant\u2019s arguments on this phase of the case, neither the identification procedure employed by the police nor anything which the defendant was called upon to do at the police station \u2014 in order to approximate the appearance and conduct of the robber \u2014 violated his privilege against self incrimination. (See <em>United, States </em>v. <em>Wade, </em>388 U. S. 218, 221-223; <em>Schmerber </em>v. <em>California, </em>384 U. S. 757, 761.)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Nor was his right to counsel denied in view of the Supreme Court\u2019s determination that the rules announced in the <em>Wade </em>case (388 U. S. 218, <em>supra) </em>and <em>Gilbert </em>v. <em>California </em>(388 U. S. 263) should not be applied retroactively. (See <em>Stovall </em>v. <em>Denno, </em>388 U. S. 293, 296, 301.) Nor do our decisions in <em>People </em>v. <em>Waterman </em>(9 N Y 2d 561), <em>People </em>v. <em>Di Biasi </em>(7 N Y 2d 544) and similar cases assist the defendant. They, too, are predicated on the privilege against self incrimination (see <em>People </em>v. <em>Waterman, </em>9 N Y 2d, at p. 566), and, as the Supreme Court recently observed in <em>Wade </em>(388 U. S., at p. 221), that privilege \u201c \u2018 protects an accused only from being compelled to testify against himself, or otherwise provide the State with evidence of a testimonial or communicative nature * * * \u2019 <em>Schmerber </em>v. <em>California, </em>384 U. S. 757, 761.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b643-8\">However, a pretrial identification procedure, even though not violative of the defendant\u2019s right to counsel or of his privilege <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>against self incrimination, may be so unfair as to amount to a denial of due process of law. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>20 N Y 2d 238, 243-244; <em>Stovall </em>v. <em>Denno, </em>388 U. S. 293, 299, 301-302, supra; <em>Palmer </em>v. <em>Peyton, 359 </em>F. 2d 199 [4th Cir.].) In the <em>Stovall </em>case (388 U. S., at p. 302), the Supreme Court pointed out that \u201c [tjhe practice of showing suspects singly to persons for the purpose of identification, and not as part of a lineup, has been widely condemned \u201d and, in <em>Brown, </em>a majority of our court very recently declared that (20 N Y 2d, at pp. 243-244)</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b644-5\"><em>\u2018 \u2018 </em>Absent <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> imperative \u2019 circumstances necessitating resort to such a procedure, the practice of having a witness secretly view, for identification purposes, only the very suspect whom the police have taken into custody for the crime can be \u2018 so unnecessarily suggestive and conducive to irreparable mistaken identification \u2019 as to amount to a denial of due process of law \u201d.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b644-6\">This, though, does not mean that Mrs. Seidman\u2019s testimony identifying the defendant in court should have been \u2014 or upon the new trial should be \u2014 necessarily excluded. It may well be that she would have been able to make an in-court identification of him even if there had been no police station show-up. The record does not permit us to make \u2018 an informed judgment \u2019 \u2019 whether the in-court identification had an <em>\u201c </em>independent source \u201d. <em>(Gilbert </em>v. <em>California, </em>388 U. S. 263, 272, <em>supra.) </em>As the Supreme Court has held, once the pretrial identification procedure is shown to be impermissible and improper, any in-court identifications, though not per se excludable, are not to be received in evidence <em>\u2018 \u2018 </em>without first determining that they were not tainted by the illegal lineup but were of independent origin\u201d. <em>(Gilbert </em>v. <em>California, </em>388 U. S., at p. 272.) Consequently, upon the new trial to be had herein, the court should, in the first instance \u2014 and out of the presence of the jury\u2014 give the People an opportunity to prove by <em>\u201c </em>clear and convincing evidence \u201d that the in-court identification was based upon observations of the suspect other than the show-up identification. <em>(United States </em>v. <em>Wade, </em>388 U. S. 218, 240, <em>supra.) </em>Only if the prosecution can establish this may the in-court identification be admitted for the consideration of the jury. On the other hand, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>if Hiere is no such clear and convincing proof, the court must exclude that identification.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-5\">Nothing decided or stated in <em>People </em>v. <em>Brown </em>(20 N Y 2d 238, <em>supra), </em>upon which the district attorney relies, militates against this result. The victim in that case had been in the company of the thief for several hours and had ample opportunity to closely observe him before and during the commission of the crime (larceny by means of false representation). It was the court\u2019s conclusion that the \u201c impermissible \u201d police station identification was to be regarded, under the circumstances presented, as \u201cnot prejudicial\u201d (p. 243) and stamped as \u201charmless error \u201d (p. 244), since it was manifest that the witness\u2019 in-court identification was not \u201cbased on, or tainted by,\u201d the pretrial identification (p. 244). The facts in the present case are very different. Here, in sharp contrast, Mrs. Seidman, a white woman, saw the robber, a Negro, wearing a hat and a heavy coat but for a few minutes during a frightening and upsetting episode. We cannot say, as we could in Broion, that on the record before us the in-court identification was not predicated, at least in part, upon the earlier grossly and unnecessarily suggestive show-up in the police station a year after the crime had been committed.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-6\">In sum, then \u2014 there must be a new trial at which the defendant (who has been in prison for two years) will be entitled to the minutes of the earlier trials, by purchase if he has the money to pay for them or at the public expense if he establishes his inability to do so. And, upon the retrial, the People may introduce Mrs. Seidman\u2019s in-court identification only if they establish, by clear and convincing proof, at a hearing to be held by the judge out of the presence of the jury, that it is based upon observations of the suspect other than the police station identification.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-7\">The judgment should be reversed and a new trial ordered in accordance with tills opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-8\">Opinion by Chief Judge Fuld. All concur, Judge Keating in result, except Judges Van Voorhis and Scileppi who dissent and vote to affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-9\">Judgment reversed, etc.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b643-9\">. In <em>Wade </em>(388 U. S. 218, <em>supra), </em>the court wrote (p. 222): \u201cWe have no doubt that compelling the accused merely to exhibit his person for observation by a prosecution witness prior to trial involves no compulsion of the \u25a0 accused to give evidence having testimonial significance. It is compulsion of the accused to exhibit his physical characteristics, not compulsion to disclose any knowledge he might have.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
