He was arrested for possession of a pistol by a detective who had been alerted by an anonymous telephone call. A motion to suppress the evidence was denied after a hearing in Criminal Court, Queens County <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>(Schreckinger, J.). Thereafter, defendant pleaded guilty and was committed to Elmira Reception Center. The Appellate Term, Second Department, affirmed the (conviction without opinion, one Justice dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-5\">Defendant contends that the seizure of the pistol was illegal because the arresting detective did not have a warrant and did not have \u201c reasonable grounds \u201d, prior to the search and arrest, to believe that a crime was being committed in Ms presence by defendant (Code Crim. Pro., \u00a7 177).</p>\n<p id=\"b375-6\">It is concluded that while defendant may be correct that the sources of the detective\u2019s belief that defendant possessed the pistol did not constitute \u201creasonable grounds \u201d for the search and the subsequent arrest, nevertheless, the search was valid under the \u201c Stop and Frisk \u201d amendment to the Code of Criminal Procedure (\u00a7 180-a, eft. July 1,1964). The search at issue here occurred on December -2, 1964. The detective had at least a reasonably based suspicion that defendant was committing a crime and was, therefore, entitled to \u201c stop\u201d Mm. Moreover, the detective was also warranted in suspecting that the defendant possessed a dangerous weapon which threatened the life of the detective as well as others in the immediate vicinity of defendant. Consequently, the seizure of the weapon was proper and the determination should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-7\">The detective, Richard Delaney, was the only witness at the hearing on the motion to suppress. He testified that on the day of the arrest he received an anonymous telephone call at the police station informing him that \u2018 \u2018 there was a male, white youth on the corner of 135th and Jamaica Avenue * * * [who] had a loaded 32 calibre revolver in Ms left hand jacket pocket \u201d. The caller also stated that the youth was \u201c eighteen \u201d, had \u201c blue eyes, blond hair \u201d and was wearing \u201c white chino-type pants \u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"Ass\">Delaney then proceeded to that location and observed from across the street an individual who \u201c matched perfectly\u201d the description given to Delaney by the informer. The youth (defendant) \u201c was standing in the middle of a group of children that had just finished bowling\u201d. Thereupon, Delaney crossed the street, \u201c took Mm [defendant] by the arm and put Mm against the wall and took the revolver out of Ms left-hand jacket pocket \u201d. Delaney did not notice any bulge in the defendant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>pocket prior to the search as the weapon <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> \u2018 was inside the lining of the jacket \u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-5\">On cross-examination, Delaney testified that he had never before arrested defendant and that he had never seen him in the neighborhood. The court concluded that: \u201cA gun which is loaded is a very dangerous instrument, and the officer in his discretion as an officer had a perfect right, in order to protect himself and protect everybody else in the Circumstances. Having reasonable grounds to believe this was the defendant who had the gun he had a perfect right to search him at the time.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b376-6\">Arguably, under <em>People </em>v. <em>Malinsky </em>(15 N Y 2d 86, 93-94) and <em>People </em>v. <em>Coffey </em>(12 N Y 2d 443, 452, cert. den. 376 U. S. 916) Delaney did not have \u201c reasonable grounds for believing \u201d that defendant possessed a pistol. The information received from the anonymous caller was not substantiated by \u201c the informer\u2019s own character and reputation \u201d or' by the \u201c separate, objective checking of the tale he tells \u201d, other than confirmation of the fact that defendant was standing at 135th Street and Jamaica Avenue <em>(People </em>v. <em>Coffey, </em>12 N Y 2d 443, 452, <em>supra). </em>Even considering the exigent circumstances, then, defendant would be correct that the search was illegal if it can be justified only by his arrest (see <em>People </em>v. <em>Malinsky, </em>15 N Y 2d 86, <em>supra; </em>cf. <em>People </em>v. <em>Teams, </em>20 A D 2d 803, apps. dsmd. 14 N Y 2d 943; 25 A D 2d 496, affd. 18 N Y 2d 835).</p>\n<p id=\"b376-7\">The question then remains whether the search was valid under the \u201cStop and Frisk \u201d law, section 180-a of-the Code of Criminal Procedure, which reads:</p>\n<p id=\"b376-8\">\u201c 1. A police officer may stop any person abroad in a public place whom he reasonably suspects is committing, has committed or is about to commit a felony or any of the crimes specified in section five hundred fifty-two of this chapter, and may demand of him his name, address and an explanation of his actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-9\">\u201c 2. When a police officer has stopped a person for questioning pursuant to this section and reasonably suspects that he is in danger of life or limb, he may search such person for a dangerous weapon. If the police officer finds such a weapon or any other thing the possession of which may constitute a crime, he may take and keep it until the completion of the questioning, at which time he shall either return it, if lawfully possessed, or arrest such person. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b377-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>This court recently upheld the constitutionality of section 180-a in <em>People </em>v. <em>Peters </em>(18 N Y 2d 238)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and <em>People </em>v. <em>Sibron </em>(18 N Y 2d 603)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-5\">In the <em>Peters </em>case, as in <em>People </em>v. <em>Rivera </em>(14 N Y 2d 441, cert. den. 379 U. S. 978), the \u201cproblem\u201d (i.e., the applicability of the statute) was divided into \u201c two stages: the legality of the detention and the legality of the frisk \u201d (18 N Y 2d, <em>supra, </em>p. 242). With respect to the \u201c detention\u201d involved in the instant ease, it seems clear that Delaney had at least a reasonable suspicion that defendant was committing a crime when he first observed defendant from across the street. As Delaney testified, the description of defendant given to him by the informer matched \u2018 \u2018 perfectly \u2019 \u2019 with his own observations. To that extent, then, the information was correct, and this substantiation justified Delaney\u2019s suspicion that the remainder of the information might also be correct. In acting upon this assumption, Delaney was \u201c exercising a reasonable and necessary police power for the prevention of crime and the preservation of the public order \u201d \u2014 a power which was recognized at common law and has now been codified in section 180-a <em>(People </em>v. <em>Peters, </em>18 N Y 2d, <em>supra, </em>p. 243).</p>\n<p id=\"b377-6\">This case raises a very serious problem which has not yet been faced directly under the newly evolved rules excluding evidence obtained unlawfully under the principle in <em>Mapp </em>v. <em>Ohio </em>(367 U. S. 643). There are exigencies affecting life, limb, or grave property damage in which the police receive information of crime, not sufficient to establish probable cause for arrest and incidental search, and yet which, to any reasonable man, demand the taking of police action to prevent serious harm. In such cases it is not enough to say that nothing should be done, or that if something is done, the resultant evidence should be suppressed. To do nothing is to succumb supinely to serious injury to members of the public or to the State itself, sincerely believed to impend, particularly as the test for action is supposed to be what a reasonable man would do under the circumstances (see <em>Ker </em>v. <em>California, </em>374 U. S. 23, 34-35; <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>United States, </em>333 U. S. 10, 13-14). To tolerate unconstitutional action as a matter of necessity, as some argue, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>but then to reject use of the evidence obtained, is hardly a proper way to justify illegal conduct as necessary, on the one hand, but to limit, on the other hand, the consequences of those actions as illegal. Needless to add, the serious problem is suggested only in cases involving serious personal injury or grave irreparable property damage and not by the problems associated with the enforcement of sumptuary laws, such as gambling, and laws of limited public consequence, such as narcotics violations, prostitution, larcenies of the ordinary kind, and the like. In this case a loaded pistol was involved. And one could hypothesize parallel cases involving explosives, poisons, or the larceny of an irreplaceable classic work of art. The presence of the suspect among a group of children is a particular circumstance suggesting that the occasion was not one in which a preliminary interrogation and .perhaps a limited frisk before search was indicated, if the safety of the children or the police officer was to be respected. For the police to have ignored the information received is not an acceptable thesis, despite the anonymity and, therefore, the undetermined reliability of the source.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-5\">The discussion is not whether exigent circumstances justify a departure from constitutional limitations. That view is impermissible. The point is that the Constitution forbids \u201c unreasonable M searches and what is reasonable is determined by the circumstances and the exigencies are not to be ignored (see <em>Camara </em>v. <em>Municipal Ct., </em>387 U. S. 523, 538-539).</p>\n<p id=\"b378-6\">With one exception, the decisions of this court passing upon the nature or quantum of reasonable suspicion which will suffice to support the temporary detention of a suspect (either under \u00a7 180-a or at common law) have involved only those situations where the suspect has acted in a suspicious manner in the presence of the officer <em>(People </em>v. <em>Peters, supra </em>[:two unknown men creeping about an apartment <em>house]; People </em>v. <em>Sibron, supra </em>[defendant observed speaking to known narcotics addicts]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Pugach, </em>15 N Y 2d 65, cert. den. 380 U. S. 936 [circumstances not revealed]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Rivera, supra </em>[defendants observed repeatedly peering in window of bar in dangerous neighborhood and moving rapidly away after seeing officers]). In <em>People </em>v. <em>Teams (supra) </em>the arrest<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>ing officers did detain and search the defendant on the basis of two anonymous telephone calls informing the police that a man, named <em>u </em>Big Jim \u201d, was firing a gun on the street. The defendant in that case, however, was known to the arresting officer- as the \u2018 \u2018 enforcer \u2019 \u2019 of the local area. Under these circumstances, the Appellate Division held that the calls constituted <em>\u201c </em>reasonable grounds \u201d for belief that the defendant had committed a crime. This court affirmed with a memorandum, citing the <em>Peters </em>and <em>Rivera </em>cases (18 N Y 2d, supra, p. 837).</p>\n<p id=\"b379-4\">\u25a0 There are decisions from other jurisdictions in which detention (as opposed to arrest) has been upheld in similar and sometimes less suspicious circumstances than those involved here (see <em>State </em>v. <em>Freeland, </em>255 Iowa 1334 [known informer\u2019s tip]; <em>State </em>v. <em>Zupan, </em>155 Wash. 80, 87-89 [anonymous tip and suspicious conduct]; <em>Busby </em>v. <em>United States, </em>296 F. 2d 328, 329-330 [9th Cir.], cert. den. 369 U. S. 876 [anonymous call and traffic violation by suspect]; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Vita, </em>294 F. 2d 524, 531 [2d Cir.], cert. den. 369 U. S. 823 [accusation by suspect\u2019s former paramour]).</p>\n<p id=\"b379-5\">In other cases, the information did not emanate from known or unknown third persons, but the grounds for the arresting officers\u2019 suspicions were no more indicative than those present here <em>(Goss </em>v. <em>State, </em>390 P. 2d 220, 223-224 [Alaska], cert. den. 379 U. S. 859 [defendants drove away from side of building at night with lights off]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Beverly, </em>200 Cal. App. 2d 119, 125 [Dist. Ct. App.], [ear left area not ordinarily open at night]; <em>State </em>v. <em>Gulczynski, </em>32 Del. 120, 123 [officer <em>\u201c </em>suspected \u201d defendant was carrying alcohol]; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hicks, </em>209 Pa. Super. Ct. 1, 7 [suspect stopped who met \u2018 \u2018 approximately the description \u201d of wanted burglar]).</p>\n<p id=\"b379-6\">Assuming that Delaney did have at least a reasonably based suspicion that the defendant was committing a crime, not only warranting but requiring some kind of police action, it follows that under the present rules he had a right to \u201c search \u201d defendant for the weapon upon which the suspected crime was predicated. Under the circumstances, the pistol was not only a threat to Delaney\u2019s life but to those who surrounded defendant at the time he was stopped. Under the literal language of the statute, then, Delaney\u2019s \u201c search \u201d of defendant was justified.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>A difficulty is that both the <em>Peters </em>and <em>Rivera </em>cases held that the \u201c permissible search \u201d following the \u201c stop \u201d allowed under common law and section 180-a should be limited to a \u201c frisk \u201d \u2014 a \u201cpatting of the exterior of one\u2019s clothing\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Peters; </em>18 N Y 2d, <em>supra, </em>p. 245; <em>People </em>v. <em>Rivera, </em>14 N Y 2d <em>supra, </em>p. 446). In fact, the <em>Rivera </em>case distinguished a \u201c frisk \u201d from a \u201c full blown search \u201d and held that, as the former was a lesser invasion of privacy, it 16 may be justified as am incident to inquiry upon grounds of elemental safety and precaution which might not initially sustain a search \u201d (14 N Y 2d, <em>supra, </em>pp. 446-447).</p>\n<p id=\"b380-4\">\u2022 In the case at bar, it is clear that Delaney did not frisk defendant. As the detective had been told that the pistol was in defendant\u2019s left-hand jacket pocket, he chose to make an immediate search of that area rather than engaging in the routine frisk. Under the circumstances this may well have been the correct procedure, or at least a reasonable alternative procedure, but it probably exceeded the limitations of the <em>Peters </em>and <em>Rivera </em>opinions.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-5\">The fact remains, however, that, in all but one of the court\u2019s decisions on this point, the arresting officers engaged in \u201c searches \u201d rather than \u201c frisks \u201d in order to obtain inculpating evidence. In <em>People </em>v. <em>Pugach (supra), </em>the evidence was discovered in a closed briefcase. The officer in <em>People </em>v. <em>Sibron (supra), </em>without first frisking the.defendant, reached into his pocket and pulled out the narcotics. In <em>People </em>v. <em>Teams (supra) </em>it appears only that the officers \u201c searched \u201d Teams and found a revolver. And even in <em>People </em>v. <em>Peters (supra), </em>where the officer initially frisked the defendant and felt something hard, this court held that the officer did not have \u201c probable cause \u201d to make the arrest until he actually reached into the defendant\u2019s pocket, withdrew, and identified the burglars\u2019 tools. In the <em>Rivera </em>case, on the other hand, the court found that the officer had probable basis to search the defendant\u2019s pocket once the frisk had revealed the likely presence of a weapon.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-6\">In short, there is ample authority to uphold the legality of the search in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-7\">Even assuming that under normal circumstances the \u201csearch\u201d allowed by section 180-a should be limited to a \u201cfrisk\u201d, the action of the detective in this case was proper, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>because of the additional circumstances. Delaney had a reasonably based suspicion not only that defendant was carrying a pistol but also that the weapon was located in his left-hand jacket pocket. It would seem unreasonable to require an officer in that situation to engage in a preparatory and undoubtedly dangerous frisk \u2014 -particularly in view of the fact that defendant was standing in the middle of a group of children at the time of the search.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b381-4\">It is recognized, however, that using anonymous information as a basis for intrusive police action is highly dangerous. To limit its use to exigent circumstances the police action must relate to matters gravely affecting personal or public safety or irreparable harm to property of extraordinary value. As noted earlier, it should not extend to all contraband or criminal violations. And, of course, the credibility of the police in claiming anonymous information should be subject to the most careful and critical scrutiny, unless abuse should merit or lead to still greater restrictions on police actions. Moreover, the police should be required to make contemporaneous or reasonably prompt detailed records of any such communications which should be subject to inspection and examination on a suppression hearing on the issue of credibility. It would be unfortunate if the people must be subject to the mercy of the criminal because of the limited and nonlethal risks arising from the conduct of the anonymous informer or from the conduct of police too gullible or too crafty.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-5\">Accordingly, the judgment of the Appellate Term should be affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b377-7\">.

Under the \u201c Stop and Frisk \u201d section of the A. L. I. Model Code of PreArraignment Procedure, the \u201c search \u201d need not he confined to a \u201c frisk \u201d. The applicable section would allow an officer who has stopped any person to \u201csearch \u201d such person and his immediate surroundings \u201c only to the extent necessary to discover any dangerous weapons which may on that occasion be used against the officer\u201d (Tentative Draft No. 1, \u00a7 2.02, subd. [5]).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b381-6\">Van Voorhis, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AeZ-\">(concurring). For reasons cogently stated in Judge Breitel\u2019s opinion herein, as it seems to me, probable cause to arrest is not necessary where there is reason to suspect that a particular individual is unlawfully carrying a dangerous weapon, or possesses a bomb on an airplane, a nuclear device in the Grand Central Station or in some comparable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>situation. In my view there is no legal difference between the situation here presented and the situations which confronted the court in <em>People </em>v. <em>Rivera </em>(14 N Y 2d 441, cert. den. 379 U. S. 978), <em>People </em>v. <em>Pugach </em>(15 N Y 2d 65, cert. den. 380 U. S. 936), <em>People </em>v. <em>Peters </em>(18 N Y 2d 238) or <em>People </em>v. <em>Sibron </em>(18 N Y 2d 603). In either instance it is suspicion engendered by some circumstance short of constituting probable cause to make an arrest that justifies the invasion of a defendant\u2019s person for the discovery of a dangerous weapon. It does not matter whether the suspicion is created by an anonymous telephone call from an unknown informer or the suspicious presence of the defendant in the hall of an apartment house, his behaviour in front of a store on the street, or the protrusion of some concealed object in his clothing which proves to be a knife or a revolver. In the <em>Peters </em>and <em>Sibron </em>cases the writer differed with the court majority only in that it seemed to him that frisking a man\u2019s person to discover a revolver, based on suspicion rather than upon probable cause for arrest, could not lead to his arrest and conviction unless what was discovered was a weapon. Peters possessed burglar\u2019s tools and Sibron had heroin in his pocket. I thought that the possibility of immediate danger, to the police officer or to the public, arising from the possession of a dangerous weapon was all that justified invading his person for the discovery of weapons, and that, unless weapons were found upon him, the invasion of his person could not be turned to account by the prosecution to convict him of anything other than illegally carrying a weapon. If the thinking of the majority in <em>Peters </em>and <em>Sibron </em>or my own more limited construction be followed, there is no reason, on account of which this appellant could not have been adjudged a youthful offender, as he was on his plea of guilty, of attempted felonious possession of a firearm. It is not necessary that there shall have existed probable cause to make an arrest. If there was reasonable basis for suspicion, as arose from the information furnished by an anonymous informer, the police could search him for a weapon which was uncovered when they did so. This was, in my view, tantamount to a frisk. I agree that the judgment and the order denying the suppression of evidence should be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b382-4\">Chief Judge Fuld</author>\n<p id=\"A28\">(dissenting). Following an anonymous telephone call to the police station that a young man \u2014 who <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>later turned out to be the 18-year-old defendant \u2014 was standing on a certain street corner and that he was armed, a detective conducted an immediate search of the defendant\u2019s person and found a loaded revolver inside the lining of his jacket. The officer admitted that there was no bulge or other indication that the boy had a gun or that he was acting in a suspicious manner and, as the court itself acknowledges (opinion, p. 337), the detective had no 1 <em>\u2018 </em>reasonable grounds \u2019 \u2019 for conducting a search or making an arrest. In the light of what I regard as settled constitutional doctrine, I see no justification for the determination below upholding the search and admitting the weapon into evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-5\">The police would undoubtedly have been derelict in their duty had they ignored the \u2019phone call but the duty to investigate does not authorize, in the first instance, a full-blown search of the suspect. The Fourth Amendment, guaranteeing \u201cprotection of privacy \u201d <em>(Warden </em>v. <em>Hayden, </em>387 U. S. 294, 304; see <em>Camara </em>v. <em>Municipal Ct., </em>387 U. S. 523, 528), means nothing if anyone may be searched at any time simply on the strength of an anonymous telephone call \u2014 made, perhaps, out of mischief or spite \u2014 denouncing him to the police as being unlawfully armed. A proper way to respond to such a communication would be to stop and question the suspect (see <em>People </em>v. <em>Rivera, </em>14 N Y 2d 441, 451-452 [dissenting opn.], cert. den. 379 U. S. 978), rather than to act as if probable cause for believing the unknown informer had already been established.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-7\">Contrary to the position taken by the majority, the record before us does not support a finding that only an immediate search of the defendant\u2019s person could insure against or prevent serious harm or imminent danger. Accordingly, there is no basis for considering at this time the application of the maxim, <em>necessitas facit licitum quad alias non est licitum, </em>to searches and seizures. (Cf. <em>Warden </em>v. <em>Hayden, </em>387 U. S. 294, <em>supra.) </em>Such considerations will be relevant when we are called upon to review cases involving bomb threats and the like.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-8\">Nor is it an answer that the search actually uncovered a gun and that the defendant merits punishment for its possession. The constitutional prohibition against an unreasonable search extends to both the criminal and the respected member of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>society and, unfortunate though it may be, the only effective way to prevent unauthorized searches that uncover no weapons is to invalidate those which do, (See <em>Mapp </em>v. <em>Ohio, </em>367 U. S. 643.) The possibility of abuse looms top large to permit the police to search any person or any dwelling fpr weapons merely, on an anonymous tip.
