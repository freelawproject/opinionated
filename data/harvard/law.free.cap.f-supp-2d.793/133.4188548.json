WALTON, District Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b173-15\">This action was initiated on behalf of individuals killed or injured on June 22, 2009, in a collision between two Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (the \u2018WMATA\u201d or \u201cMetrorail\u201d) trains. On October 18, 2010, the plaintiffs, except for the Estate of Jeanice McMillan,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> who filed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>a separate amended complaint at the same time, filed their consolidated Second Amended Master Complaint (\u201cCompl.\u201d or \u201cMaster Complaint\u201d) against the following defendants: ADCO Circuits Incorporated (\u201cADCO\u201d); Ansaldo STS USA, Incorporated (\u201cAnsaldo\u201d); Alstom Signaling, Incorporated (\u201cAlstom\u201d); the WMATA; and Arinc Incorporated, alleging claims for negligence, products liability, and breach of warranty. One of the defendants, Alstom, has filed motions to dismiss both the Second Amended Master Complaint and the Jeanice McMillan Estate Second Amended Complaint and Jury Demand (\u201cMcMillan Estate Compl.\u201d or \u201cMcMillan Estate Complaint\u201d). Alstom argues that certain counts of the Master Complaint must be dismissed because they fail to state claims upon which relief may be granted for the following reasons: (1) Counts 7, 9, 10, and 14 on the ground that they are \u201ctime-barred under the District of Columbia\u2019s ten-year statute of repose[,] D.C.Code \u00a7 12-310 (2001);\u201d (2) Counts 11, 12, and 15 on the ground that they \u201care time-barred under the statute of limitations [applicable to] breach of warranty claims under the Uniform Commercial Code [ (the \u2018UCC\u2019) ] as adopted by the District of Columbia[,] D.C.Code \u00a7 28:2-725;\u201d (3) Count 14 on the ground that it is duplicative of Count 7; (4) Counts 11, 12, and 15 on the ground \u201cthat the [Master] Complaint fails to allege the essential element[s] necessary for a claim [of] breach of warranty;\u201d and (5) Counts 16 and 17 on the ground that they are \u201cderivative claims\u201d of Counts 7, 9, 10, 11, 12, 14, and 15. Defendant Alstom Signaling Inc.\u2019s Motion to Dismiss, April 21, 2010 (\u201cMot. to Dismiss\u201d) at 1-2. Alstom argues that those counts of the McMillan Estate Complaint which correspond with the counts of the Master Complaint should also be dismissed for the reasons just outlined,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and therefore the McMillan Estate Complaint should be dismissed in its entirety \u201cfor failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.\u201d Defendant Alstom Signaling Inc.\u2019s Motion to Dismiss, June 18, 2010 (\u201cMcMillan Estate Mot. to Dismiss\u201d) at l.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b175-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>For the reasons that follow, Alstom\u2019s motions will be granted in part and denied in part.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b175-5\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b175-6\">The complaints allege that \u201c[o]n Monday, June 22, 2009, [at] about 4:58 p.m., eastern daylight time, ... Metrorail train 112 collided with the rear end of stopped train 214 near the Fort Totten station in Washington, D.C.\u201d Compl. \u00b6 156. As a result of the collision, nine passengers and the striking train\u2019s operator were killed and more than seventy passengers were injured. Compl. \u00b6 161. The accident purportedly occurred because \u201c[t]he Metrorail automatic train control system stopped detecting the presence of train 214 (the ... train [that was struck]) in track circuit B2-304, which caused train 214 to stop and also allowed speed commands to be transmitted to train 112 (the striking train) until the collision.\u201d National Transportation Safety Board, Railroad Accident Report 10/02: Collision of Two Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority Metrorail Trains Near Fort Totten Station 120, <em>available at </em>http://www.ntsb.gov/publictn/ 2010/RAR1002.pdf.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-9\">Following the accident, civil actions were filed by injured passengers and representatives of passengers who were killed, and those actions were consolidated by this Court. As a result of the consolidation, the plaintiffs filed a single Master Complaint. CMO \u00b6\u00b6 31-32. A representative of Jeanice McMillan, the operator of train 112 who died in the collision, subsequently filed a separate complaint. McMillan Estate Compl. \u00b6 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-10\">As noted earlier, according to the complaints, the trains collided because the WMATA\u2019s automatic train control system failed to detect the presence of train 214 on the track. Compl. \u00b6 163. Due to the false reading and because train 112 was operating in automatic mode, it did not slow as it approached the track occupied by train 214. <em>Id. </em>\u00b6\u00b6 158, 163. The train operator, McMillan, overrode the automatic mode by activating emergency brakes when train 112 was about 300 feet from train 214. <em>Id. </em>\u00b6 160. However, despite McMillan\u2019s actions, it failed to stop in time to prevent the collision due to the train\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>speed. <em>Id,.</em><footnotemark><em>5</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b176-4\">The WMATA\u2019s train detection system is comprised of various components, including \u201ctransmitters, receivers, and impedance bonds,\u201d <em>id. </em>\u00b6 165, which, according to the plaintiffs, were manufactured by defendants Alstom, Ansaldo, and ADCO, <em>id. </em>\u00b6\u00b6 18, 166. The train detection system was designed in the 1970s, <em>id. </em>\u00b6 164, and some of the parts were actually manufactured by General Railway Signal (\u201cGRS\u201d), \u201cthe predecessor corporation to [defendant Alstom,\u201d <em>id. </em>\u00b6 166. Around 2004, the WMATA began replacing GRS components with those provided by United Switch <em>&amp; </em>Signal (\u201cUS &amp; S\u201d), the predecessor corporation of defendant Ansaldo. <em>Id. </em>\u00b6 166. WMATA employees and U.S. &amp; S personnel installed the replacement components, <em>id., </em>and neither complaint contends that Alstom had any role in installing the new components other than making its engineers available for technical discussions and participating in an investigation concerning an earlier event involving the train detection system, <em>id. </em>\u00b6\u00b6 166, 173.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-5\">The use of both GRS and U.S. <em>&amp; </em>S components allegedly diminished the sensitivity of the train detection system, resulting in the track circuit not de-energizing as it should have to detect the presence of a train on the track. <em>Id. </em>\u00b6 167. Specifically, one symptom, \u201cbobbing,\u201d caused the train detection system for a block of track to indicate the block was vacant, then occupied, and then vacant again. <em>Id. </em>\u00b6 168. This problem was detected by a WMATA crew installing the replacement components, <em>id., </em>and a work order was opened to correct the bobbing problem, but it was not acted upon before the crash, which occurred five days later, <em>id. </em>\u00b6 169.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-9\">Both the Master Complaint and the McMillan Estate Complaint raise claims of negligence, products liability, and breach of warranty against defendant Alstom.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>\u00b6\u00b6 228-241, 250-276, 284-305. The claims primarily allege that malfunctions in the electronic train control system caused the crash. <em>Id. </em>\u00b6 235. Alstom, as one of the providers of the components used in the electronic train control system, is alleged to have failed to properly design, manufacture, install, inspect, test, and maintain the automated warning system that should have prevented the two trains from colliding. <em>Id. </em>\u00b6\u00b6 240, 253. The plaintiffs also allege that Alstom breached implied and express warranties that its products, such as the electronic control system, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>were fit for the safe transportation of WMATA employees and fare-paying passengers. <em>Id. </em>\u00b6\u00b6 269, 274, 302; McMillan Estate Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 76, 81, 86. Finally, the complaints assert wrongful death and separate survival claims for the \u201cpre-impact fright, extreme pain and suffering, fear and anticipation of impending injury and death.\u201d Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 306, 308, 310.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-4\">For the reasons set forth below, the Court denies the motion to dismiss as to Counts 7, 9, 10, 16, and 17 of the Master Complaint and Counts 1, 2, 3, 8, 9, and 10 of the McMillan Estate Complaint. However, the Court grants the motion as to Counts 11, 12, and 15 of the Master Complaint, and as to Counts 4, 5, and 6 of the McMillan Estate Complaint. The Court will also grant the motion to dismiss either Counts 7 or 14 of the Master Complaint, permitting those plaintiffs to select one of the two counts on which they wish to proceed.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-5\">II. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b177-6\">A motion to dismiss under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) tests whether a complaint has properly stated a claim upon which relief may be granted. <em>Woodruff v. DiMario, </em>197 F.R.D. 191, 193 (D.D.C. 2000). For a complaint to survive a Rule 12(b)(6) motion, Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8(a) requires that it contain only \u201ca short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 8(a)(2). Although Rule 8(a) does not require \u201cdetailed factual allegations,\u201d a plaintiff is required to provide \u201cmore than an unadorned, the-defendant-unlawfully-harmed-me accusation,\u201d <em>Ashcroft v. Iqbal, </em>556 U.S. 662,-, 129 S.Ct. 1937, 1949, 173 L.Ed.2d 868 (2009) (citing <em>Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, </em>550 U.S. 544, 555, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007)), in order to \u201cgive the defendant fair notice of what the ... claim is and the grounds upon which it rests,\u201d <em>Twombly, </em>550 U.S. at 555, 127 S.Ct. 1955 (omission in original) (internal quotation marks omitted). In other words, \u201ca complaint must contain sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to \u2018state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.\u2019 \u201d <em>Iqbal, </em>556 U.S. at -, 129 S.Ct. at 1949 (quoting <em>Twombly, </em>550 U.S. at 570, 127 S.Ct. 1955). A claim is facially plausible \u201cwhen the plaintiff pleads factual content that allows the court to draw [a] reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Twombly, </em>550 U.S. at 556, 127 S.Ct. 1955). A complaint alleging facts which are \u201cmerely consistent with a defendant\u2019s liability ... stops short of the line between possibility and plausibility of entitlement to relief.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting <em>Twombly, </em>550 U.S. at 557, 127 S.Ct. 1955).</p>\n<p id=\"b177-12\">In evaluating a Rule 12(b)(6) motion under this framework, \u201c[t]he complaint must be liberally construed in favor of the plaintiff, who must be granted the benefit of all inferences that can be derived from the facts alleged,\u201d <em>Schuler v. United States, </em>617 F.2d 605, 608 (D.C.Cir.1979) (internal quotation marks omitted), and the Court \u201cmay consider only the facts alleged in the complaint, any documents either attached to or incorporated in the complaint!,] and matters of which [the Court] may take judicial notice,\u201d <em>E.E.O.C. v. St. Francis Xavier Parochial Sch., </em>117 F.3d 621, 624 (D.C.Cir.1997). Although the Court must accept the plaintiffs\u2019 factual allegations as true, any conclusory allegations are not entitled to an assumption of truth, and even those allegations pleaded with factual support need only be accepted to the extent that \u201cthey plausibly give rise to an entitlement to relief.\u201d <em>Iqbal, </em>556 U.S. at-, 129 S.Ct. at 1950. If \u201cthe [C]ourt finds that the plaintiff! has] failed to allege all the material elements of [his or her] cause of action,\u201d then the Court may dismiss that claim without prej<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>udice, <em>Taylor v. FDIC, </em>132 F.3d 753, 761 (D.C.Cir.1997), or with prejudice, provided that the Court \u201cdetermines that the allegation of other facts consistent with the challenged pleading could not possibly cure the deficiency,\u201d <em>Firestone v. Firestone, </em>76 F.3d 1205, 1209 (D.C.Cir.1996) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b178-4\">III. Legal Analysis<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b178-5\">A. <em>Alstom\u2019s Statute of Repose Challenge</em></p>\n<p id=\"AkG\">The District of Columbia statute of repose bars any action for \u201cpersonal injury\u201d and \u201cwrongful death\u201d \u201cresulting from the defective or unsafe condition of an improvement to real property\u201d if the injury or death occurs more than ten years after the \u201cimprovement was substantially completed.\u201d D.C.Code \u00a7 12 \u2014 310(a)(1) (2001). An improvement is substantially completed when \u201cit is first used\u201d or \u201cfirst available for use.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 12-310(a)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b178-6\">According to Alstom, the automatic train detection system is an improvement to real property and therefore the plaintiffs\u2019 personal injury and wrongful death claims are covered by the statute of repose.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Def.\u2019s Mem. at 15. Alstom argues that because the system \u201cis a dated system whose design goes back to the early 1970s,\u201d it was \u201csubstantially completed\u201d over thirty years before the June 22, 2009 crash that is the subject of this litigation. <em>Id. </em>at 16. Furthermore, Alstom asserts that the injuries resulting from the crash occurred more than ten years after installation of the train detection system was first completed. <em>Id. </em>For these reasons Alstom argues that the plaintiffs\u2019 personal injury claims are barred by the statute of repose.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 17.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-10\">The plaintiffs argue in response that the statute of repose is not available to Alstom. Pis.\u2019 Jt. Opp\u2019n at 4. They refer the Court to section 310(b)(3) of the statute, which excludes from its coverage \u201cany manufacturer or supplier of any equipment or machinery or other articles installed in a structure upon real property.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing D.C.Code \u00a7 12 \u2014 310(b)(3)). And according to the plaintiffs, \u201cAlstom, via its predecessor corporation, GRS, manufactured and supplied the original defective signaling equipment\u201d and \u201c[t]he statute of repose therefore does not immunize [defendant Alstom.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b178-11\">Alstom argues that the reach of section 310(b)(3) is limited. First, it argues that if a defendant is both a manufacturer and a designer of an allegedly defective product section 310(b)(3) does not apply to those aspects of the defect related to design. Def.\u2019s Mem. at 11-12 <em>&amp; </em>n. 2; Alstom\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>Reply at 2 (\u201cAlstom cannot be sued for negligent design alone, and Counts Seven, Nine, Ten, and Fourteen of the [Master] Complaint must be dismissed to the extent that they accuse Alstom of ... fault in its role as a designer.\u201d); <em>see also id. </em>at 6. Alstom also argues that because section 310(b)(3) was added as an amendment in 1987, many years after the train detection system had been installed, the manufacturer exclusion should not be applied retroactively to it, Def.\u2019s Mem. at 11 n. 2, as doing so \u201cwould violate due process by divesting Alstom of its substantive right not to be sued by reviving time-barred claims,\u201d Alstom\u2019s Reply at 2-3. Specifically, Alstom states that its predecessor \u201cdesigned, manufactured, and installed the automatic train control system, including its component parts, in the 1970s,\u201d Def.\u2019s Mem. at 11 n. 2, and \u201c[a]s such, any and all potential claims against Alstom for its work on the Metro contract expired as of 1985, before the Amendment Act became law,\u201d Alstom\u2019s Reply at 4. Alstom posits that it justifiably relied upon the prior version of the statute of repose that accorded immunity from liability, even to manufacturers, <em>id. </em>at 5-7, 10-12, and argues that retroactive application would be \u201cinherently unfair,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 7. Alstom further asserts that if it is held subject to the 1987 amendment, it would be divested of a \u201csubstantive right not to be sued.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 3. Finally, Alstom argues that an examination of the legislative intent of the scope of the 1987 amendment suggests that the amendment should only be made applicable to asbestos manufacturers, as opposed to all manufacturers in general. <em>Id. </em>at 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-5\">1. <em>The Applicability of Section 310(b)(8) of the Statute of Repose to Manufacturers and Suppliers Facing Claims of Negligent or Faulty Design</em></p>\n<p id=\"b179-6\">Alstom argues that because in effect it wears two hats, that of a designer and that of a \u201cproducer\u201d of equipment, and because the statute of repose protects design professionals from being sued, the Court should dismiss at least those claims lodged against it related to defective design. Alstom\u2019s Reply at 1-2. Furthermore, in its reply brief Alstom directs the Court\u2019s attention to the plaintiffs\u2019 opposition brief as proof that \u201cthere is no dispute amongst the parties that the Amendment Act did not affect the statute of repose\u2019s protection] [of] design professionals.\u201d Alstom\u2019s Reply at 5-6 (alterations in original) (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting <em>325-343 E. 56th Street Corp. v. Mobil Oil Corp., </em>906 F.Supp. 669, 674 (D.D.C.1995)); <em>see also id. </em>at 10 n. 5; <em>id., </em>Ex. B at 3 (stating that the change in the law should only apply to manufacturers and suppliers who are not \u201cinvolved with the actual design of the improvement,\u201d and that the statute is intended to \u201ccut off actions for design defects\u201d); McMillan Estate Opp\u2019n, Ex. A (reproduction of District of Columbia Statute of Limitations Act of 1986, D.C. Law 6-202 (Jan. 8, 1987)) (amending section 12-310 only \u201c[b]y striking the period after the last word of the section and inserting in its place, \u2018or (3) any manufacturer or supplier of any equipment or machinery or other articles installed in a structure upon real property, or (4) any action brought by the District of Columbia government\u2019 \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b179-8\">While the plaintiffs do concede that design professionals are protected under both the original 1972 version of the statute and the amended statute, they attempt to limit their concession by claiming that Alstom\u2019s roles as designer and manufacturer cannot be separated for the purpose of the statute of repose. <em>See </em>Pis.\u2019 Jt. Opp\u2019n at 4 (stating that \u201cthe designer of a defective or unsafe condition of an im<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>provement to real property is protected from liability by a ten-year statute of repose. If the plaintiffs injury occurs ten years and one day after the improvement is complete, she cannot recover against even the most reckless designer\u201d (internal quotation marks and citation omitted)); <em>id. </em>at 6 (stating that \u201c[sjection (b)(3) narrowed the statute of repose to make it clear that D.C.\u2019s stream of commerce analysis applied in force and exempted <em>only </em>the designer ...\u201d (emphasis in original) (internal quotation marks omitted))'; <em>see also id. </em>at 5 (stating that while Alstom \u201cseeks to distinguish its design role from its manufacture role[, t]he statute makes no such distinction\u201d). They allege that because Alstom is a manufacturer, excluded from protection under the statute of repose, its activities as both a designer and manufacturer must be excluded from protection.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>The plaintiffs would have the Court disregard the plain language of the statute by permitting a designer of a product to be sued after the statutory limitation has expired because the designer was also a manufacturer of the product. <em>See </em>D.C.Code \u00a7 12-310 (stating that the ten year statute of repose is applicable to everyone, except manufacturers and suppliers of equipment or machinery, sued for injuries resulting from \u201cthe defective or unsafe condition of an improvement to real property\u201d). The plaintiffs, in effect, seek an end run around the statute of repose. Because the plaintiffs\u2019 argument is untenable, and they have conceded that design professionals are protected under both the original 1972 version of the statute and the amended statute, <em>see </em>Pis.\u2019 Jt. Opp\u2019n at 4, 6, the Court finds that the plaintiffs\u2019 claims against Alstom in its capacity as a designer must be dismissed.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-3\">[i]f [d]efendant Alstom had merely manufactured a product defectively designed by another party, and the [p]laintiffs obtained judgment against [d]efendant Alstom, it would obtain a right of indemnity against the designer. But [because] the statute of repose would immediately extinguish that right <em>against the designer </em>because more than ten years has elapsed ... [,] Alstom would still be liable for the entire amount. Pis.' Jt. Opp\u2019n at 5. This example fails to take into account the differences between the manufacturing defect and design defect claims. A product may have a defective design without being defectively manufactured, and vice versa. Therefore, dismissing the design defect claims against Alstom would limit its liability to manufacturing defects only.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b180-6\">2. <em>The Retroactivity of the 1987 Amendment to D.C. Code Section 12-310, Which Added Section 310(b)(3)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b180-7\">Alstom contends that \u201c[retroactive] changes are inherently unfair as they rewrite the rules of society without notice <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>and without any opportunity for affected persons to comply. Indeed, [they] can potentially act to divest parties of their vested rights.\u201d Alstom\u2019s Reply at 7. Alstom therefore argues that section 310(b)(3), which was enacted in 1987, should not be applied retroactively. <em>Id. </em>at 12. Moreover, Alstom states that \u201c[a]mendments to statutes should generally not be applied retroactively unless the language of the statute and the intent behind it demand that outcome.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 8 (citing <em>Kaiser Aluminum &amp; Chemical Corp. v.

No. 92-579, 86 Stat. 1275 (1972) (enacting statute of repose); Alstom\u2019s Reply at 6. Manufacturers were exempted from the statute of repose by subsection (b)(3), which was enacted through the adoption of D.C. Law 6-202. McMillan Estate Opp\u2019n, Ex. A (reproduction of D.C. Law 6-202). This amendment came into effect on February 28, 1987 and applied to \u201cactions filed in a court after July 1,1986.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b181-5\">The District of Columbia Circuit held in <em>Wesley Theological Seminary of the United Methodist Church v. United States Gypsum Co., </em>876 F.2d 119, 122-23 (D.C.Cir.1989), that the retroactive application of this amendment did not violate due process. In <em>Wesley, </em>the defendant allegedly manufactured and sold defective asbestos tiles in 1957. <em>Id. </em>at 120. Prior to the amendment, the defendant in <em>Wesley </em>would have been immune from suit; however, the 1987 amendment revived the plaintiffs claim by excluding manufacturers from the protection of the statute. <em>Id. </em>at 120-21. Deciding that the retroactive application of the 1987 amendment did not violate the defendant\u2019s rights under the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment, the District of Columbia Circuit surmised that the Supreme Court had assessed the retroactivity question on the basis of \u201crationality.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 122 (quoting <em>Usery v. Turner Elkhorn Mining Co., </em>428 U.S. 1, 15-16, 96 S.Ct. 2882, 49 L.Ed.2d 752 (1976) (stating that \u201clegislative [a]cts adjusting the burdens and benefits of economic life come to the Court with a presumption of constitutionality,\u201d and it is the defendant\u2019s burden to demonstrate a due process violation by showing that \u201cthe legislature has acted in an arbitrary and irrational way,\u201d because the case law is \u201cclear that legislation readjusting rights and burdens is not unlawful solely because it upsets otherwise settled expectations. This is true even though the effect of the legislation is to impose a new duty or liability based on past acts\u201d (internal citations omitted))). Applying this rationality standard, the court determined that it was not irrational for the legislature to decide that losses stemming from defects \u201cdiscovered long after installation should fall on the supplier.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b181-8\">Similar to claims that had been raised by the plaintiff in <em>Wesley, </em>the plaintiffs\u2019 claims in this case would be untimely filed under the 1972 version of the statute of repose. However, just as the District of Columbia Circuit in <em>Wesley </em>found no due process proscription against retroactively applying the 1987 amendment to revive 1957 claims, this Court similarly finds that retroactively reviving the claims in this case does not offend due process either. Specifically, the Court can find no justifica<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>tion for why the same \u201crational legislative purpose\u201d for the statute that warranted giving it \u201cstrong deference\u201d in <em>Wesley, id., </em>namely, requiring the supplier to bear the loss for latent defects, <em>id., </em>should not also apply to Alstom\u2019s products, whose alleged defects may have been discovered as late as 2004, long after they were distributed to the public, Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 9,166.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-4\">Alstom attempts to avoid the application of <em>Wesley </em>by arguing that the Circuit \u201cdid not consider the Supreme Court\u2019s holding the year before in <em>Bowen[ v. Georgetown University </em>Hospital,] nor did it have the benefit of the Court\u2019s subsequent decisions in <em>Kaiser[ Aluminum &amp; Chemical Corp. v. Bonjorno </em>] or <em>Landgraff v. USI Film Products].\u201d </em>Alstom\u2019s Reply at 11. The Court is not persuaded by these arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-5\">The Supreme Court decisions cited by Alstom concern general presumptions in statutory interpretation and do not directly apply here because the statutory language is clear. Although the Court in <em>Bowen </em>relied on the general principle that \u201c[r]etroactivity is not favored in the law\u201d in rendering its decision, it further stated that retroactive application of legislation is permitted if there is an \u201cexpress statutory grant\u201d to do so. <em>Bowen v. Georgetoum Univ. Hosp., </em>488 U.S. 204, 208, 109 S.Ct. 468, 102 L.Ed.2d 493 (1988) (assessing whether the Medicare Act expressly granted power to make retroactive rules). Similarly, while <em>Landgraf </em>acknowledged the <em>presumption </em>against the retroactive application of statutes, the Supreme Court also acknowledged that this presumption will not prevail if \u201cCongress first makes its intention clear.\u201d <em>Landgraf v. USI Film Prods., </em>511 U.S. 244, 267, 280, 114 S.Ct. 1483, 128 L.Ed.2d 229 (1994) (assessing whether the Civil Rights Act of 1991 applied retroactively). Furthermore, when the Supreme Court in <em>Kaiser </em>held that an amendment to a post-judgment interest statute did not retroactively apply to a judgment entered before the enactment, it did so based on the \u201cplain language\u201d of the statute, which \u201cevidence[d] clear congressional intent\u201d against retroactivity. <em>Kaiser Aluminum &amp; Chem. Corp. v. Bonjorno, </em>494 U.S. 827, 838, 110 S.Ct. 1570, 108 L.Ed.2d 842 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b182-10\">The plain language of the District of Columbia\u2019s statute of repose is equally clear. In adopting the 1987 amendment, the legislature stated that \u201c[t]his act shall apply to actions pending in a court on July 1, 1986, <em>and to actions filed in a court after July 1, 1986.\u201d </em>McMillan Estate Opp\u2019n, Ex. A (emphasis added) (D.C. Law 6-202). Because the lawsuits here were filed in 2009, <em>see </em>Compl. \u00b6 25, they clearly fall within the intended scope of the amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-11\">Alstom also seeks to distinguish its manufacturing activity, which occurred after the statute of repose was enacted in 1972, from the defendant\u2019s activity in <em>Wesley, </em>which occurred before the 1972 enactment. Alstom\u2019s Reply at ll.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Alstom argues that this distinction makes its reliance on the 1972 version of the statute, which did protect manufacturers, and therefore its \u201cequitable arguments against retroactive application ... far stronger than the\u201d defendant\u2019s arguments in <em>Wesley. Id. </em>Although Alstom\u2019s argument may have some merit, the Supreme Court has stated that \u201creliance alone is insufficient to establish a constitutional violation.\u201d <em>United States v. Carlton, </em>512 U.S. 26, 33, 114 S.Ct. 2018, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>129 L.Ed.2d 22 (1994) (rejecting a due process challenge against the retroactive application of an amendment to the Tax Code where the challenger had relied on the pre-amendment version, in part, because the Tax Code creates \u201cno vested right\u201d in taxpayers). Therefore, this Court finds, similar to the reasoning in <em>Carlton, </em>that any alleged detrimental reliance by Alstom does not by itself create a due process violation. Although Alstom contends that it had a vested right not to be subject to suit created by the original version of the statute when the 1987 amendment was enacted, Alstom\u2019s Reply at 11, this Circuit in <em>Wesley </em>rejected the same argument in construing the same statute \u2014 that the 1987 amendment divested defendants of a substantive right not to be sued, 876 F.2d at 121. Finding no reason to conclude that <em>Wesley </em>is not controlling, this Court is compelled to enforce the 1987 amendment retroactively.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-5\">3. <em>The Scope of Section 310(b)(8)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b183-6\">Alstom further claims that the legislature intended the 1987 amendment to reach only \u201cproducers of hazardous materials, in particular asbestos.\u201d Alstom\u2019s Reply at 6. The language of the statute, however, makes no such distinction between asbestos producers and producers in general. <em>See </em>D.C.Code \u00a7 12 \u2014 310(b)(3) (making the statute of repose inapplicable to <em>\u201cany </em>manufacturer or supplier of any equipment or machinery or other articles installed in a structure upon real property\u201d (emphasis added)). A plain reading of the statute, therefore, excludes from its coverage all producers of equipment or machinery installed on real property. <em>See United States v. Villanueva-Sotelo, </em>515 F.3d 1234, 1237 (D.C.Cir.2008) (\u201cWe must first determine whether the language at issue has a plain and unambiguous meaning with regard to the particular dispute in the case. If it does, our inquiry ends and we apply the statute\u2019s plain language. But if we find the statutory language ambiguous, we look beyond the text for other indicia of congressional intent.\u201d (internal citations and quotation marks omitted)); <em>see also McCormick v. Columbus Conveyor Co., </em>522 Pa. 520, 564 A.2d 907, 910 (1989) (\u201cThe word \u2018any\u2019 is generally used in the sense of \u2018all\u2019 or \u2018every' and its meaning is most comprehensive.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b183-9\">Furthermore, the Court notes that not all statute of repose cases decided before the 1987 amendment involved hazardous materials. <em>See, e.g., J.H. Westerman Co. v. Fireman\u2019s Fund Ins. Co., </em>499 A.2d 116, 117 (D.C.1985) (producers of electrical switches); <em>Britt v. Schindler Elevator Corp., </em>637 F.Supp. 734, 735 (D.D.C.1986) (manufacturer of elevators). Thus, if the District of Columbia legislature intended for section 310(b)(3) to reach only asbestos manufacturers, given the litigation that had already taken place, it could have used more restrictive language other than use of the term \u201cany manufacturer.\u201d Importantly, one of Alstom\u2019s own exhibits supports the reasonableness of this conclusion by indicating that the 1987 amendment was enacted to achieve a separate intent, i.e., \u201c[sjection 4 of the draft bill would bring the District\u2019s law in line with those of [the] overwhelming majority of states,\u201d Alstom\u2019s Reply, Ex. A at 3, an intent distinguishable from concerns about the overwhelming amount of asbestos litigation taking place at the time. Therefore, Alstom\u2019s own evidence suggests that while some provisions of D.C. Law 6-202 were intended to apply solely to asbestos litigation, such as the addition of subsection (10) to section 12-301, <em>see </em>D.C. Law 6-202 \u00a7 3,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> and the addition of section 12-311, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number><em>see </em>D.C. Law 6-202 \u00a7\u00a7 2, 5,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> other provisions, such as the addition of subsections (3) and (4) to section 12-310, did not specifically relate to asbestos litigation, see D.C. Law 6-202 \u00a7 4.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b184-4\">For all of these reasons, this Court finds that the District of Columbia statute of repose is not available as a defense to Alstom resulting from its role as a manufacturer and denies Alstom\u2019s motion to dismiss Counts 7,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> 9, 10, and 14 of the Master Complaint and Counts 1, 2, 3, and 8<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> of the McMillan Estate Complaint. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>Furthermore, because Alstom is not entitled to the protection accorded by the statute of repose in its capacity as a manufacturer, the Court need not address the plaintiffs\u2019 position that the WMATA\u2019s replacement of Alstom\u2019s GRS components reset the ten-year repose period.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-5\">B. <em>The Plaintiffs\u2019 Breach of Warranty Claims</em></p>\n<p id=\"b185-6\">Alstom also seeks dismissal of the plaintiffs\u2019 breach of warranty claims (Counts 11, 12, and 15 of the Master Complaint and Counts 4, 5, and 6 of the McMillan Estate Complaint) on the grounds that they are insufficiently pleaded and time-barred under the UCC\u2019s statute of limitations. According to Alstom, the plaintiffs have not adequately alleged a claim for breach of the implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose because they allegedly neglected to state that Alstom is a \u201cmerchant\u201d or \u201cseller\u201d of \u201ccomponent parts for train detection systems,\u201d Def.\u2019s Mem. at 17, or that the sale was not an isolated sale of goods, <em>id. </em>at 21. Alstom also contends that the non-merchant exception for the warranty of fitness does not apply because the plaintiffs did not plead that the \u201cparticular circumstances of [this] case justify the fact that Alstom is a non[-]merchant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 21. In addition, Alstom maintains that the express and implied warranty claims are time-barred under the UCC\u2019s statute of limitations. <em>Id. </em>at 17-20. Specifically, Alstom contends that (1) the component parts of the transit system were delivered in the 1970s, (2) the plaintiffs do not allege that the express warranty extended to future performance such that the discovery rule would apply to those claims, and (3) based on <em>Hunt v. DePuy Orthopaedics, Inc., </em>636 F.Supp.2d 23, 26 (D.D.C.2009), and <em>Lee v. Wolfson, </em>265 F.Supp.2d 14, 19-20 (D.D.C.2003), the discovery rule does not apply to implied warranties. Def.\u2019s Mem. at 20. Thus, Alstom alleges that the breach of warranty claims accrued at the time of delivery, and are barred by the four-year statute of limitations of UCC section 28:2-725. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b185-9\">The plaintiffs respond, arguing that the breach of warranty claims are not based on a contract of sale, and are therefore not subject to the UCC statute of limitations. The plaintiffs refer the Court to <em>Bowler v. Stewart-Warner Corp., </em>563 A.2d 344 (D.C.1989), for the proposition that consumers\u2019 claims for breach of the implied warranties are \u201cnot subject to the various rules governing [UCC] sales\u201d because \u201cthe warranty in a products liability case brought by a consumer [is] quite different from a warranty in connection with a sale of goods.\u201d Pis.\u2019 Jt. Opp\u2019n at 7 (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting <em>Bowler, </em>563 A.2d at 346). Specifically, the plaintiffs allege that consumer-injury claims based on products liability are governed by rules applicable to strict liability, including a discovery rule with a three-year statute of limitations. <em>Id. </em>at 8-9. In addition, the plaintiffs argue that <em>Bowler </em>is irreconcilable with <em>Hunt </em>and <em>Lee, </em>\u201cand as a result they directly contradict <em>Bowler, </em>which this Court must follow as a definitive statement of D.C. law;\u201d therefore, according to the plaintiffs, <em>Lee </em>and <em>Hunt </em>are invalid. <em>Id. </em>at 9-10. Moreover, the plaintiffs contend that even if <em>Lee </em>and <em>Hunt </em>are not nullified by <em>Bowler, </em>they are distinguishable. <em>Id. </em>at 10 (stating that <em>Hunt </em>and <em>Lee </em>are distinguishable because each plaintiff in those cases was \u201ca party to the sale,\u201d which brought each \u201ctransaction under the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>[UCC]\u201d as a \u201cclassic [UCC] \u2018sale of goods\u2019 \u201d).<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Finally, the plaintiffs request that the Court defer ruling on Alstom\u2019s motion to dismiss the express warranty claims until the plaintiffs have had an opportunity to conduct discovery regarding any potential express warranties of future performance made by Alstom or its predecessor, and \u201cany further warranties to [defendant WMATA\u201d when Alstom met with WMATA \u201cin October 2006 regarding the ongoing signaling overhaul,\u201d as claims stemming from that event \u201cwould not necessarily be barred by the four-year statute of limitations.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-4\">In addition to these arguments, the McMillan Estate further argues that its complaint sufficiently alleges that Alstom is a \u201cseller\u201d or \u201cmerchant.\u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> McMillan Estate Opp\u2019n at 13-15. The McMillan Estate directs the Court to allegations that Alstom \u201cprovided train traffic control equipment, software, and support services to [the] WMATA,\u201d and that Alstom \u201cwas involved in the design, manufacture, marketing, inspection, distribution, sale, and/or warranty to the public, including the WMATA subway system ... and placed into the stream of commerce, the automatic train control system, or component parts thereof, for the WMATA system.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 14 (quoting McMillan Estate Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 4-5). The McMillan Estate argues that these allegations are sufficient to establish that Alstom is \u201cone who sells or contracts to sell goods\u201d under D.C.Code section 28:2-103 (2001) (definition of seller) and as \u201cone who deals in goods of the kind or otherwise, by its occupation, holds itself out as having knowledge or skill peculiar to the practices or goods involved\u201d under D.C.Code section 28:2-104 (2001) (definition of merchant). <em>Id. </em>at 14. In addition, the McMillan Estate contends that there is no indication that a plaintiff has an \u201caffirmative obligation to plead that the [alleged merchant] ... was not engaged in an isolated sale of goods.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 15. The McMillan Estate also alleges that \u201cAlstom/GRS expressly guaranteed the future performance of its automatic train control system and components\u201d in its contract with the WMATA,<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> and therefore the four-year statute of limitations was tolled until the breach was discovered on the day of the incident. <em>Id. </em>at 16-17. Finally, the McMillan Estate argues that the discovery rule may apply to implied warranty claims because, although the District of Columbia has held that implied warranties themselves cannot guarantee future performance, the District has not addressed \u201cthe more limited issue of whether an implied warranty claim may accrue under a discovery rule when there is also a separate and express guarantee of future performance.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 17.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-9\">In its reply to the joint opposition, Alstom states that \u201c[w]hether precluded by the statute of limitations, or simply duplicative of the strict liability claim, the im<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>plied warranty counts must be dismissed.\u201d Alstom\u2019s Reply at 3. Specifically, Alstom notes that the plaintiffs pleaded breach of warranty under the UCC in their complaints, but their opposition \u201cabandoned these [UCC] claims.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Alstom alleges that in having done so, the \u201c[plaintiffs concede that their breach of implied warranty claims are subsumed by, and coextensive with, their strict products liability claim (Count [9]).\u201d <em>Id. </em>Furthermore, Alstom contends that <em>Bowler </em>is inapplicable because it deals only with the issue of which instruction on liability should be given to a jury \u2014 strict liability, warranty, or both \u2014 where a defective product gave rise to claims for both breach of the implied warranty of merchantability and strict liability, whereas it \u201csays nothing about what the statute of limitations is for a \u2018tortious\u2019 breach of implied warranty claim.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 14. Alstom also argues that a ruling on the express warranty claim should not be deferred until after the plaintiffs are given an opportunity to conduct discovery because, while \u201cdiscovery might reveal an express warranty of future performance made by Alstom[,] ... [the p]laintiffs have not alleged a breach of an express warranty <em>of future performance </em>in their Mom-plaint.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 3 (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b187-5\">Alstom also replies to the McMillan Estate\u2019s opposition, arguing that, in addition to its foregoing arguments made in response to the joint opposition, the future performance exception does not apply to the express warranty claim because the Court cannot consider the GRS/AJstom contract since it was not referenced in or attached to the complaints, Alstom\u2019s McMillan Estate Reply at 6-7, and because \u201cnaked contract specifications cannot ... be bootstrapped into unlimited express warranties of lifetime performance,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 7. In addition, Alstom contends that the McMillan Estate\u2019s supposition that an implied warranty claim may \u201caccrue under a discovery rule when there is also a separate and express guarantee of future performance\u201d is not supported by any legal authority, <em>id. </em>at 7 (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting McMillan Estate Opp\u2019n at 17), and in any event the claim fails because the McMillan Estate did not allege in its complaint an express warranty of future performance, <em>id. </em>at 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-7\">1. <em>Do the Complaints Allege that Alstom is a \u201cMerchant\u201d or \u201cSeller\u201d under the UCC?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b187-8\">Under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8(a)(2), a pleading must contain only a \u201cshort and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 8(a)(2). As such, \u201ca pleader must allege facts, directly or <em>indirectly, </em>supporting each element of [a] claim.\u201d <em>McDonald Bros., Inc. v. Tinder Wholesale, LLC, </em>395 F.Supp.2d 255, 265 (M.D.N.C.2005) (emphasis added); <em>see also Guthery v. United States, </em>562 F.Supp.2d 136, 138-39 (D.D.C.2008). Accordingly, courts are permitted to draw reasonable inferences from the pleadings when ruling on a Rule 12(b)(6) motion. <em>Guthery, </em>562 F.Supp.2d at 138-39.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-9\">Under District of Columbia law, \u201ca warranty that ... goods shall be merchantable is implied in a contract for their sale if the seller is a merchant with respect to goods of that kind.\u201d D.C.Code \u00a7 28:2-314(1) (2001). A claim in a complaint based on a breach of implied warranty of merchantability theory must therefore contain facts plausibly showing that the defendant is a merchant. <em>See </em>D.C.Code \u00a7 28:2-314 cmt. 13 (stating that in order to allege a claim for breach of warranty, the plaintiff must prove the existence of the warranty); D.C.Code \u00a7 28:2-314(1) (stating that the warranty of merchantability is implied in a contract for the sale of goods \u201cif the seller <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>is a merchant\u201d).<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> A \u201cmerchant\u201d is defined as \u201ca person who deals in goods of the kind or otherwise by his occupation holds himself out as having knowledge or skill peculiar to the practices or goods involved in the transaction.\u201d D.C.Code \u00a7 28:2\u2014 104(1). Thus, \u201c[a] person making an isolated sale of goods is not a \u2018merchant\u2019 within the meaning of the full scope of [section 28:2-314].\u201d D.C.Code \u00a7 28:2-314 cmt. 3; <em>see also Rock Creek Ginger Ale Co., Inc. v.

Alstom argues that the discovery rule exception enumerated in this provision does not apply to implied warranties. Defi\u2019s Mem. at 18-20. The plaintiffs, however, contend that their breach of warranty claims are grounded in tort, not on a contract of sale, and are therefore not subject to the UCC, <em>see </em>Pis.\u2019 Jt.

To the contrary, where a plaintiff alleges claims for both strict products liability and breach of implied warranties based on allegedly defective products against a party not in privity with the plaintiff, the implied warranty claims must be dismissed because the actions are the same. <em>See, e.g., Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., </em>646 F.Supp.2d at 56 (denying permission to bring breach of implied warranty claim where the parties were not in privity of contract, because, under such circumstances, the plaintiff could only bring a claim in tort).

Alstom contends that the plaintiffs have not alleged any express warranties of future performance, and therefore, the statute of limitations began to run in the 1970s, when its component parts were delivered to the WMATA.

Two requirements limit the recognition of such warranties. First, the requirement that the warranty extend to future performance means that the warranty cannot simply be a representation of the product\u2019s condition at the time of delivery. <em>South Jersey Gas Co., </em>2010 WL 1742542, at *5; <em>Winchester Homes, Inc. v.

The plaintiffs do not specifically identify any express warranty made by Alstom that included an explicit statement warranting the future performance of the automatic train control system, nor do the plaintiffs identify any reference to a specific future time period. Thus, the complaints fail to set forth a cognizable UCC-based breach of express warranty claim that is not time-barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-4\">b. <em>The Alstom/GRS contract with the WMATA did not include an express warranty of future performance</em></p>\n<p id=\"AZ\">For several reasons, the Alstom/GRS contract also fails to establish an express warranty of future performance. First, the plaintiffs do not reference the WMATA contract anywhere in their complaints, and therefore, the contract itself cannot be considered in deciding Alstom\u2019s motion to dismiss. <em>See St. Francis Xavier Parochial Sch., </em>117 F.3d at 624 (stating that the Court \u201cmay consider [in deciding a 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss] only the facts alleged in the complaint, any documents either attached to or incorporated in the complaint[,] and matters of which [the Court] may take judicial notice\u201d). Second, even if the complaints were amended to include the language relied upon by the McMillan Estate, an express warranty of future performance would still not be adequately asserted. The particular contract language the McMillan Estate points to all fall under the sub-heading \u201cFail-Safe Design Criteria,\u201d and include the following statements: (1) \u201c[a]ny amplifier breaking into spurious oscillations shall not result in an unsafe condition,\u201d McMillan Estate Opp\u2019n, Ex.

E (Contract); and (3) \u201c[cjomponent or system failures which are not self-detecting shall not cause unsafe conditions, even if added to other failures,\u201d <em>id. </em>None of these statements, either individually or collectively, qualify as anything more than a description of the product\u2019s condition at the time of delivery. <em>See South Jersey Gas Co., </em>2010 WL 1742542, at *5 (\u201cA warranty that explicitly extends to future performance of goods ... is more than a mere representation [of] the condition of a product at the time of delivery.\u201d); <em>Travelers Indem.

Cir. 107 (same). Furthermore, none of these statements designate a defined future period of time during which the alleged warranty would apply. <em>See Joswick v. Chesapeake Mobile Homes, Inc., </em>362 Md. 261, 765 A.2d 90, 96 (2001) (\u201cThere is no problem when the warranty simply states that the goods have a certain positive quality or are free from all or certain defects but states no time period during which the goods will continue to have that quality. That kind of warranty does not reference or extend to any future performance.\u201d); <em>see also, e.g., Travelers Indem.

Accordingly, Count 14 \u201crests on the same factual allegations ..., would be decided under the same legal standards ..., and authorizes the same forms of relief\u2019 as Count 7. <em>Iacangelo v. Georgetown Univ., </em>No. 05-2086(PLF), 2011 WL 149852, at *2 (D.D.C. January 19, 2011). The Court therefore will require that the plaintiffs choose which of the two counts they desire to pursue.

Therefore, the wrongful death and survival claims survive the Court\u2019s partial grant of Alstom\u2019s motion to dismiss. The Court therefore denies Alstom\u2019s motion to dismiss Counts 16 and 17 of the Master Complaint and Counts 9 and 10 of the McMillan Estate Complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-4\">IV. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b194-5\">For the foregoing reasons, Alstom\u2019s motion to dismiss is granted in part and denied in part. The Court\u2019s ruling is summarized as follows. Alstom\u2019s arguments that the plaintiffs\u2019 negligence and strict products liability claims (Counts 7, 9, 10, and 14 of the Master Complaint and Counts 1, 2, 3, and 8 of the McMillan Estate Complaint) should be dismissed as barred by the statute of repose fail, except to the extent that these claims extend to Alstom in its capacity as a designer. Also, the Court\u2019s CMO and subsequent orders permit the McMillan Estate to file separate claims involving issues it deems \u201csubstantially different\u201d from those pleaded in the Master Complaint, and therefore, Count 8 of the McMillan Estate Complaint may be pursued because it is reasonably deemed substantially different from Count 10 of the Master Complaint. Furthermore, although the plaintiffs adequately pleaded their implied warranty claims, the Court agrees with Alstom that the implied warranty claims are duplicative of the strict products liability claims. In addition, the Court agrees with Alstom that the express warranty claim is barred by the statute of limitations. Moreover, the Court agrees with Alstom that Count 14 of the Master Complaint is duplicative of Count 7 of the Master Complaint. Finally, because some causes of action on which the wrongful death and survival actions are based survived Alstom\u2019s motion to dismiss, both the wrongful death and survival claims survive the Court\u2019s partial grant of Alstom\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-10\">Based on these rulings, the Court denies Alstom\u2019s motion to dismiss as to Counts 7, 9, 10, 16, and 17 of the Master Complaint <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>and Counts 1, 2, 3, 8, 9, and 10 of the McMillan Estate Complaint, and grants the motion to dismiss Counts 11, 12, and 15 of the Master Complaint and Counts 4, 5, and 6 of the McMillan Estate Complaint. However, the Court is dismissing Count 12 of the Master Complaint and Count 5 of the McMillan Estate Complaint <em>without prejudice, </em>and therefore, the plaintiffs may move for reconsideration of the dismissal of these claims if discovery reveals that Alstom made any express warranties that explicitly guarantee future performance for a specified period of time that encompasses the date of the event that is the subject of this case. The plaintiffs must also inform the Court of whether it desires to pursue Count 7 or 14 of the Master Complaint, which will result in dismissing the other claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-5\">SO ORDERED this 22nd day of June, 2011.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b173-11\">. The representative of the Estate of Jeanice McMillan has filed a separate Second Amended Complaint and Jury Demand on behalf of Ms. McMillan, the operator of one of the trains, who was killed in the collision. However, the counts of each complaint relevant to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>this motion are nearly identical and so are the facts; therefore, unless otherwise noted, when the Court references the complaint it will be citing the Second Amended Master Complaint throughout this opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b174-5\">. The Court notes that the McMillan Estate Complaint only alleges one count of negligent train traffic control (Count 1). Indeed, Alstom does not argue that any claims in the McMillan Estate Complaint are duplicative. Therefore, Alstom\u2019s arguments regarding the allegedly duplicative claims in the Master Complaint (Counts 7 and 14) do not correspond to any claims in the McMillan Estate Complaint.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b174-6\">. Alstom\u2019s motion to dismiss the McMillan Estate Complaint is based merely on \"all the reasons set forth in Alstom's Motion to Dismiss the Master Complaint.\u201d McMillan Estate Mot. to Dismiss at 1-2. Although many of the counts in the McMillan Estate Complaint mirror the counts pleaded in the Master Complaint, none of the claims in the Master Complaint correspond to Count 8 of the McMillan Estate Complaint. <em>See </em>McMillan Plaintiff's Response and Opposition to Defendant Alstom\u2019s Motion to Dismiss (\"McMillan Estate Opp'n\u201d) at 2. This count is therefore not directly addressed by Alstom\u2019s motion to dismiss. Alstom argues, however, that under the Case Management Order (the \"CMO\u201d) \"McMillan is precluded from pursuing [any] claims\u201d other than those pleaded in the Master Complaint, Defendant Alstom Signaling Inc.\u2019s Reply Memorandum in Support of its Motion to Dismiss, July 16, 2010 (\"Alstom\u2019s McMillan Estate Reply\u201d) at 4, because the CMO states that the Master Complaint \"shall be the operative pleading[],\u201d CMO No. 1 \u00b6 32, and, in any event, Count 8 of the McMillan Estate Complaint is not \"substantially different from\u201d Count 10 of the Master Complaint, Alstom's McMillan Estate Reply at 3 (quoting Minute Order, June 24, 2010).

Energy Regulatory Comm\u2019n, </em>962 F.2d 20, 25 (D.C.Cir.1992). In any event, the June 24, 2010 Order permits the McMillan Estate to file separate claims so long as \"the <em>plaintiff </em>deems the issues ... substantially different from those [advanced] in the Master Complaint.\u201d Minute Order, June 24, 2010 (emphasis added). Count 10 of the Master Complaint alleges negligent failure to warn primarily based on an alleged duty to advise the plaintiffs of \"any deficiencies associated with the subway system,\u201d specifically the automatic train control and the automatic warning systems.

Indeed, Alstom refers the Court to a case from the United States District Court for the Western District of Virginia which examined the Virginia statute of repose, a statute similar to the District of Columbia statute. <em>See id. </em>(citing <em>Jordan v.
