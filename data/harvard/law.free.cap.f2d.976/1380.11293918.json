Specifically, do these policy statements constitute binding authority or are they merely advisory? Following the lead of the Third, Fifth, and Sixth Circuits, <em>see United States v. Blackston, </em>940 F.2d 877, 893 (3d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 112 S.Ct. 611, 116 L.Ed.2d 634 (1991); <em>United States v. Headrick, </em>963 F.2d 777 (5th Cir.1992); <em>United States v. Cohen, </em>965 F.2d 58 (6th Cir.1992), we hold that such policy statements are advisory.</p>\n<p id=\"b1463-16\">In this case, the appellant, while serving a three-year term of supervised release (imposed as part of his sentence for a Class D felony), tested positive for cocaine use, and the court revoked his supervised release. The Sentencing Commission\u2019s policy statements designated appellant\u2019s cocaine use a Grade C violation, <em>see </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 7B1.1(a)(3) p.s. (Nov. 1991), and, with a Criminal History Category V, his revocation range called for seven to thirteen months imprisonment. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 7B1.4, p.s. The relevant statutory provisions, however, required the court to sentence appellant to prison for at least one year (one-third of his three-year term of supervised release), <em>see </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(g) (1986), and gave it the discretion to sentence him to prison for as much as two years, <em>see </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e)(3) (Supp. 1990). The district court considered the policy statement, but considered its upper limit (thirteen months imprisonment) inadequate under the circumstances. The court opted, instead, to sentence appellant to twenty-four months imprisonment, the maximum term authorized by section 3583(e)(3). We cannot say that, in doing so, the court abused its discretion. Accordingly, its judgment is</p>\n<p id=\"AmG\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
