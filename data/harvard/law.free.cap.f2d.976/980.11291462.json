GARZA, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b1063-10\">Plaintiff, Laura Hickey, sued the Irving Independent School District and several of its officers (hereafter collectively \u201cUSD\u201d), alleging that IISD failed to accommodate her medical disability, in violation of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794, and tortiously exposed her to harmful substances, all while she was a student at Irving High School. The district court dismissed Hickey\u2019s complaint on the grounds that it was barred by the statute of limitations. Hickey contends that the district court erred in a) dismissing her claim as time-barred; b) dismissing her claim for lack of diversity; c) dismissing her claim under Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6); and d) referring her case to a magistrate without her consent. Because the district court erred in dismissing Hickey\u2019s complaint as time-barred, we reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b1063-12\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b1063-13\">Hickey\u2019s complaint<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and motion to proceed in forma pauperis were received in the district court on September 9, 1991. <em>See </em>Record on Appeal at 7 (Findings, Conclusions and Recommendation of the United States Magistrate Judge). Thq district court granted Hickey\u2019s motion to proceed in forma pauperis and referred her case to a United States magistrate. In her Findings, Conclusions and Recommendation, the magistrate found that 1)\u2018 the limitations period applicable to'Hickey\u2019s state and federal claims was two years; 2) Hickey\u2019s claims were time-barred, since she had last attended Irving High School during the academic year 1988-89 \u2014 more than two years before the district court received her complaint on September 9, 1991; and 3) because Hickey\u2019s claims were time-barred, they lacked an arguable basis in law, and were subject to dismissal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(d).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The Magistrate did not mention the possibility of tolling the statute of limitations. <em>See </em>Record on Appeal at 5-8. Hickey filed objections to the Magistrate\u2019s Findings, Conclusions and Recommendation, in which she argiied that she did not reach the age of eighteen years until September 9, 1989, and that the statute of limitations should have been tolled until that date on account of her minority. <em>See id. </em>at 10. The district court adopted the magistrate\u2019s Findings, Conclusions and Recommendation and dismissed Hickey\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"982\">*982</page-number>complaint, without mentioning .the possibility of tolling. <em>See id. </em>at 15-16.</p>\n<p id=\"b1064-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b1064-5\">Hickey argues that the district court erred in dismissing her claims as time-barred because the statute of limitations was tolled until she turned eighteen. We review the district court\u2019s ruling de novo. <em>See Kennedy v. Electricians Pension Plan, IBEW </em># 995, 954 F.2d 1116, 1120 (5th Cir.1992) (district court\u2019s ruling\u2014 that statute of limitations was inapplicable \u2014 reviewed de novo).</p>\n<p id=\"b1064-6\">The magistrate correctly concluded that the applicable statute of limitations was Tex.Civ.Prac. &amp; Rem.Code Ann. \u00a7 16.-003(a) (Vernon 1986), which provides that \u201c[a] person must bring suit for ... personal injury ... not later than two years after the day the cause of action accrues.\u201d By its terms, section 16.003(a) applies to Hickey\u2019s state law personal injury claims. Furthermore, section 16.003(a) is the appropriate statute of limitations to use in connection with Hickey\u2019s claims under the Rehabilitation Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b1064-7\">The selection of a limitations period applicable to Rehabilitation Act cases is governed by 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988, which directs the court to 1) follow federal law if federal law provides a limitations period; 2) apply the common law, as modified by state constitution or statute, if no limitations period is provided by federal law; but 3) apply state law only if it is not inconsistent with the Constitution and laws of the United States. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1988(a) (West Supp.1992); <em>Wilson v. Garcia, </em>471 U.S. 261, 267, 105 S.Ct. 1938, 1942, 85 L.Ed.2d 254 (1985) (describing three-step analysis provided in 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b1064-10\">Federal law does not provide a limitations period. The Rehabilitation Act provides that the \u201cremedies [and] procedures ... set forth in title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964\u201d are available to aggrieved persons proceeding under the Rehabilitation Act. <em>See </em>29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794a(a)(2) (1988). However, title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 does not provide a limitations period. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2000d to 2000d-4a. Furthermore, the general federal statute of limitations, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1658, does not apply to the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, since it applies only to statutes enacted after December 1, 1990. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1658 (West Supp.1992). Consequently, the district court was called upon to apply a state statute of limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b1064-11\">The district court was required to adopt, from the forum state, the statute of limitations governing the state cause of action most closely analogous to Hickey\u2019s Rehabilitation Act claims. <em>See Goodman v. Lukens Steel Company, </em>482 U.S. 656, 660, 107 S.Ct. 2617, 2620, 96 L.Ed.2d 572 (1987) (\u201c[Fjederal courts should select the most appropriate or analogous state statute of limitations.\u201d); <em>Bd. of Regents of the Univ. of New York v. Tomanio, </em>446 U.S. 478, 483-84, 100 S.Ct. 1790, 1795, 64 L.Ed.2d 440 (1980) (\u201c[T]his Court has repeatedly \u2018borrowed\u2019 the state law of limitations governing an analogous cause of action.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1064-12\">This Court has not yet decided which Texas statute of limitations governs claims under the Rehabilitation Act. Texas law supplies several limitations periods, applicable to different types of claims.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Of the state law claims governed by the Texas statutes of limitations, we find that personal injury claims are most nearly analogous to the discrimination claims authorized by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"983\">*983</page-number>the Rehabilitation Act.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> As the Supreme Court has recognized, claims for discrimination are essentially claims for personal injury. <em>See Goodman, </em>482 U.S. at 661, 107 S.Ct. at 2621 (Actions pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981, alleging racial discrimination, \u201care in essence claims for personal injury.\u201d); <em>Wilson, </em>471 U.S. at 280, 105 S.Ct. at 1949 (Claims under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, including those which allege discrimination, \u201care best characterized as personal injury ac-tions_\u201d); <em>see also Price v. Digital Equipment Corp., </em>846 F.2d 1026, 1028 (5th Cir.1988) (holding that Texas\u2019 two-year statute of limitations applied to suit alleging racial discrimination under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981); <em>Cervantes v. IMCO, Halliburton Services, </em>724 F.2d 511, 514 (5th Cir.1984) (holding that Texas\u2019 two-year statute of limitations applied to section 1981 action for discrimination on the basis of national origin). Because we find personal injury claims to be most nearly analogous to Hickey\u2019s claims for discrimination, section 16.-003(a), governing personal injury claims,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> should be applied to Hickey\u2019s suit unless doing so would be inconsistent with federal law.</p>\n<p id=\"b1065-5\">Application of section 16.003(a) to Rehabilitation Act cases is not inconsistent with federal law or the Constitution. The Supreme Court has observed that \u201c[i]t is most unlikely that the period of limitations applicable to [personal injury] claims ... ever was, or ever would be, fixed in a way that would discriminate against federal claims, or be inconsistent with federal law in any respect.\u201d <em>Wilson, </em>471 U.S. at 279, 105 S.Ct. at 1949. Furthermore, we note that other courts have applied two-year statutes of limitations governing personal injury claims to suits under the Rehabilitation Act.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> None of these courts has found any conflict with federal law. Because we perceive no antagonism between federal law and the application of section 16.003(a), we hold that the magistrate correctly adopted section 16.003(a) as the statute of limitations applicable to Hickey\u2019s Rehabilitation Act claim.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1065-11\">Nonetheless, the district court erred by dismissing Hickey\u2019s complaint without considering the possibility of tolling the statute of limitations on account of Hickey\u2019s minority. Hickey last attended Irving High School during the academic year 1988-89, which would have ended in May or June of 1989. Because that date <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"984\">*984</page-number>preceded the district court\u2019s receipt of Hickey\u2019s complaint (on September 9, 1991) by more than two years, the magistrate found Hickey\u2019s claims to be barred by the statute of limitations. However, Tex.Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem.Code Ann. \u00a7 16.001 (Vernon 1986)<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> provides that the statute of limitations is tolled while the plaintiff is under the age of 18 years.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Consequently, the limitations period did not begin to run until Hickey turned 18, which she alleges to have occurred on September 9, 1989.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> If that date was in fact Hickey\u2019s 18th birthday, her last day to file suit was September 8, 1991.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Since September 8, 1991 was a Sunday, Hickey had until Monday, September 9, 1991 to file her suit.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The district court received Hickey\u2019s complaint on September 9, 1991.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Therefore, if Hickey\u2019s 18th birthday actually was September 9, 1989, her claims were not barred by the statute of limitations. The district court erred in dismissing Hickey\u2019s complaint without considering the possibility that the statute of limitations was tolled on account of Hickey\u2019s minority.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1067-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"985\">*985</page-number>III</p>\n<p id=\"Ayr\">For the foregoing reasons, we REVERSE and REMAND for reconsideration of the timeliness of Hickey\u2019s complaint.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1063-11\">. Hickey alleges that she attended Irving High School during the academic years 1986-87 and 1988-89, and that during that time she was disabled due to formaldehyde sensitization, a medical condition which made it impossible for her to tolerate substances containing formaldehyde, such as smoke, paint, and pesticides. Hickey claims that IISD failed to provide her with a learning environment which accommodated her disability, in violation of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794 (1988). Hickey further maintains that IISD negligently and/or willfully injured her by exposing her to harmful chemicals.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1063-15\">.

The Supreme Court has extended this holding to actions under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981. <em>Goodman, </em>482 U.S. at 661, 107 S.Ct. at 2617, <em>aff\u2019g 777 </em>F.2d 113 (3rd Cir.1985). Because the federal interests noted in <em>Wilson </em>are no less pressing in the context of the Rehabilitation Act than in the contexts of section 1981 and section 1983, the Texas personal injury statute of limitations, section 16.003, should be applied uniformly to all claims under 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794. <em>Cf. Morse </em>at 4 (\"The selection of one particular state statute of limitations applicable to all claims brought under \u00a7 504 [of the Rehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794,] provides that certainty and consistency the lack of which was criticized in <em>Wilson </em>and <em>Goodman.\u201d).</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b1066-4\">.

Although the magistrate noted that Hickey was \"a former citizen of Texas,\" there is no indication that the district court\u2019s dismissal of Hickey\u2019s complaint was in any way premised on lack of jurisdiction. <em>See </em>Record on Appeal at 5-8 (Findings, Conclusions and Recommendation of the United States Magistrate Judge), 15-16 (Judgment and Order). This argument is therefore without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1066-15\">Hickey also contends that the district court erred in dismissing her complaint pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6). While the district court's judgment stated that Hickey\u2019s complaint was \u201cdismissed pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6),\u201d <em>see </em>Record on Appeal at 16, we are convinced, after reviewing the record, that Rule 12(b)(6) actually was not the basis for dismissal. Rule 12(b)(6) deals with the dismissal of complaints for \"failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.\" <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6). Neither a Rule 12(b)(6) motion nor any pleading was filed by IISD, whereby USD could have asserted that Hickey failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted. Furthermore, the magistrate's Findings, Conclusions and Recommendation neither mentioned Rule 12(b)(6) nor suggested that Hickey had failed to state a claim. Consequently, it is clear that the district court dismissed Hickey\u2019s complaint entirely on the basis of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(d), and that the district court\u2019s reference to Rule 12(b)(6) was inadvertent.</p>\n<p id=\"b1066-16\">Lastly, Hickey argues that the district court erred by submitting her case to a magistrate without first obtaining her consent. We disagree. Hickey asserts that the magistrate proceeded under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(c), which requires the consent of the parties. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(c) (1988). However, the magistrate did not exercise the powers conferred by \u00a7 636(c), such as ordering entry of judgment. <em>See id. </em>Furthermore, the magistrate explicitly stated that Hickey\u2019s case was referred to her pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(b), <em>see </em>Record on Appeal at 5, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"985\">*985</page-number>which does not require the consent of the parties. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(b) (1988). Because the magistrate proceeded under \u00a7 636(b), and not \u00a7 636(c), Hickey\u2019s consent was not required.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
