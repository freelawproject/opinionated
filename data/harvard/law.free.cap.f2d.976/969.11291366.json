Asserting that, under Louisiana law, Delays <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"970\">*970</page-number>was a statutory employee of Chevron when he was injured and, therefore, that Chevron is immune from tort liability for Delays\u2019 injuries, Chevron moved for summary judgment. The district court granted that motion, and the Brocks appeal. Finding that Delays was Chevron\u2019s statutory employee pursuant to La.Rev.Stat.Ann. \u00a7 23:1061 (West 1985) (pre-1990 amendment version), we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1052-4\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b1052-5\">The Brocks\u2019 claims arise from an accident in which Delays, while working inside a Chevron plant as a contract firewatcher<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> employed by J.E. Merit Constructors, Inc., slipped and fell in a pool of an oil lube product produced at the plant. The incident occurred while Delays was preparing an area for a welding operation to be performed by another contract company employed by Chevron.</p>\n<p id=\"b1052-6\">The Brocks\u2019 case is before this court for the second time. Initially, Chevron moved for summary judgment on the grounds that, under a 1990 amendment to section 1061 of Chapter 23 of the Louisiana Revised Statutes, Chevron was Delays\u2019 statutory employer and immune from tort liability for his injuries. The district court agreed and granted summary judgment in favor of Chevron, but, finding that the 1990 amendment to section 1061 \u2014 which became effective January 1, 1990 \u2014 only applies prospectively, we reversed and remanded. <em>See Brock v. Chevron Chemical Co., </em>946 F.2d 1544 (5th Cir.1991). We did not determine whether Chevron is a statutory employer under section 1061 as it existed before January 1, 1990.</p>\n<p id=\"b1052-7\">Upon remand, Chevron again moved for summary judgment, this time asserting that Chevron is a statutory employer under section 1061 as it existed <em>before </em>January 1, 1990 and that, as such, it is immune from tort liability for Delays\u2019 injuries. Again, the district court agreed and entered a judgment dismissing the Brocks\u2019 action. The Brocks appeal from that judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1052-12\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b1052-13\">In considering the Brocks\u2019 appeal from the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in favor of Chevron, we review the record de novo. <em>See Topalian v. Ehrman, </em>954 F.2d 1125, 1131 (5th Cir.1992), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 113 S.Ct. 82, 121 L.Ed.2d 46 (1992); <em>International Shortstop, Inc. v. Rally\u2019s, </em>939 F.2d 1257, 1263 (5th Cir.1991), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 112 S.Ct. 936, 117 L.Ed.2d 107 (1992). Our standard is well settled: Summary judgment is proper if the party moving for such a judgment establishes that there is an absence of genuine issues of material fact. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c); <em>Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, </em>477 U.S. 317, 322, 106 S.Ct. 2548, 2552, 91 L.Ed.2d 265 (1986); <em>Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., </em>477 U.S. 242, 250, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 2511, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986); <em>Matsushita Elec. Ind. Col. v. Zenith Radio Corp., </em>475 U.S. 574, 585-88, 106 S.Ct. 1348, 1355-57, 89 L.Ed.2d 538 (1986). Once a movant has made such a showing, the non-movant must establish each of the challenged essential elements of its case for which it will bear the burden of proof at trial. <em>See Catrett, </em>477 U.S. at 322, 106 S.Ct. at 2552; <em>Topalian, </em>954 F.2d at 1131. Although the nonmovant may satisfy this burden by tendering depositions, affidavits, and other competent evidence,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> \u201c[mjere conclusory allegations are not competent summary judgment evidence, and they are therefore insufficient to defeat or support a motion for summary judgment.\u201d <em>Topalian, </em>954 F.2d at 1131 (citations omitted). In short, \u201cthe adverse party\u2019s response ... must set forth specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial.\u201d Fed. R.Civ.P. 56(e). Where the nonmoving party fails to make such a showing and the moving party has met its summary judgment burden, the latter is entitled to sum<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"971\">*971</page-number>mary judgment as a matter of law. Fed. R.Civ.P. 56(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b1053-4\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b1053-5\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b1053-6\">As an <em>Erie </em>court, although we apply federal procedural rules including the federal summary judgment standard, we apply Louisiana\u2019s substantive law. <em>See Erie R. Co. v. Thompkins, </em>304 U.S. 64, 78, 58 S.Ct. 817, 822, 82 L.Ed. 1188 (1938); <em>see also Salve Regina College v. Russell, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, -, 111 S.Ct. 1217, 1221-23, 113 L.Ed.2d 190 (1991) (under <em>Erie, </em>we review district court state law determinations de novo). The Louisiana law at issue \u2014 Louisiana\u2019s Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act as it existed on August 28, 1989 \u2014 provides that: (1) the remedy offered under the Act is the <em>exclusive </em>remedy for employees who sustain injuries in the course of their employment, <em>see </em>La.Rev.Stat.Ann. \u00a7 23:1021, et seq.; (2) under the Act, employees are entitled to recover worker\u2019s compensation benefits from their employers, <em>see </em>La.Rev.Stat. Ann. \u00a7 23:1031; (3) employees are also entitled to recover worker\u2019s compensation from any entity deemed to be their \u201cstatutory employer,\u201d <em>see </em>La.Rev.Stat.Ann. \u00a7 23:1061;<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> (4) and, because a \u201cprincipal\u201d (for our purposes, a person or entity hiring workers through a contractual relationship) statutory employer is secondarily liable for worker\u2019s compensation benefits to an injured employee, such employers are given tort immunity for injuries sustained by their contract employees. <em>See </em>La.Rev.Stat. Ann. \u00a7 23:1032, subd. A(l)(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b1053-9\">We determine statutory employer status under Louisiana law by applying a three-level test formulated by the Louisiana Supreme Court in <em>Berry v. Holston Well Serv., Inc., </em>488 So.2d 934, 937-38 (La.1986). <em>First, </em>focusing on the scope of the contract work, our central question is whether the contract work is specialized or non-specialized \u2014 \u201cwhether the contract work requires a degree of skill, training, experience, education and/or equipment not normally possessed by those outside the contract field.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 938. Specialized work is, as a matter of law, \u201cnot a part of the principal\u2019s trade, business or occupation, and the principal is not the statutory employer of the specialized contractor\u2019s employees.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1053-13\"><em>Second, </em>where the contract work is non-specialized, we compare the contract work with the principal\u2019s trade, business, or occupation. Our inquiry at this second level includes the following questions: (a) whether the contract work is \u201croutine and customary,\u201d (b) whether the principal has the equipment and manpower capable of doing the same work, and (c) whether industry participants normally contract out this type of work. <em>Id. </em>\u201cThese guidelines are not absolute or rigid, but are instead to be applied relatively, taking into consideration the size, complexity, integration (either horizontal or vertical), or lack thereof, of the principal.\u201d <em>Berry, </em>488 So.2d at 938. <em>Third, </em>we inquire whether the principal was actually engaged in the contract work at the time of the contract employee\u2019s injury. <em>Id. </em>at 938-39.</p>\n<p id=\"b1053-14\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b1053-15\">Applying the <em>Berry </em>test, the district court found that: (1) \u201c[bjased upon the submissions of both parties,\u201d Delays was performing non-specialized work of an essentially maintenance nature;<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> (2) the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"972\">*972</page-number>work performed by Delays was \u201croutine, customary, regular and expected\u201d in that \u201cChevron's safety policy required that fire-watch hands prepare the area where hot work is to be performed by covering drains and cleaning up any spills\u201d; Chevron supplied the equipment used by its firewatch-ers; and \u201cfirewatch hands are essential to and part of Chevron\u2019s trade, business and occupation\u201d; and (3) the fact that Delays was actually working in conjunction with another Chevron contract company \u2014 he was preparing an area for hot work to be done by that company \u2014 when he slipped and fell suggests that Chevron was engaged in Delays\u2019 work at the time of his injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b1054-4\">Chevron has established that, under the <em>Berry </em>test, the Brocks have presented no claims capable of succeeding on their merits and, therefore, that the Brocks have failed to raise any genuine issues of material fact worthy of trial. <em>See supra </em>Part II. To survive Chevron\u2019s motion for summary judgment, the burden is upon Chevron to establish each of the challenged essential elements of its case for which it would bear the burden of proof at trial. <em>See Catrett, </em>477 U.S. at 322, 106 S.Ct. at 2552; <em>Topalian, </em>954 F.2d at 1131. To accomplish this, the Brocks rely heavily upon the deposition testimony of Jimmy Lalonde, senior supervisor of Merit \u2014 the company which directly employed Delays and supplied firewatchers and general laborers to Chevron and other companies working at Chevron\u2019s Louisiana plant. Specifically, to satisfy the <em>Berry </em>test on a prima facie basis, the Brocks rely upon Lalonde\u2019s testimony that: (1) at the time of Delays\u2019 accident, firewatchers received training beyond that given to normal laborers, which, according to the Brocks, suggests that their work is specialized; (2) because one company, Merit, supplied fire-watchers for all contractors and companies working at the Chevron plant at the time of Delays\u2019 accident (and this suggests that the industry customarily contracted out this type of work), firewatch work is not part of the trade, business, or occupation of Chevron, and (3) Chevron employees were not performing firewatch work at the time of Delays\u2019 accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b1054-7\">1</p>\n<p id=\"b1054-8\">We find that the Brocks\u2019 reliance on La-londe\u2019s testimony to establish that fire-watch work is specialized is misplaced. Although Lalonde testified that Merit fire-watchers receive one-half of a day more training than Merit general laborers, La-londe also testified that this one-half day of extra training is also given to Chevron\u2019s direct employees working at the plant:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1054-9\">Q. Let me ask you this: Fire watchers receive training above and beyond the training that your other employees receive; is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1054-10\">A. Not necessarily. We have some ... people that have been through fire training classes, also, <em>and all Chevron employees go through fire training classes.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1054-11\">Q. Am I correct that fire watchers receive training different or above and beyond those that just are general laborers with your company?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1054-12\">A. Eventually everyone is going to be going through the fire training classes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1054-13\">Applying the <em>Berry </em>test, we and the Louisiana state appeals courts have held that welders, pipefitters, electricians, painters, and sandblasters are not specialized employees if (1) the contract work they perform consists primarily of manual labor or (2) the principal\u2019s own employees are capa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"973\">*973</page-number>ble of performing the same work.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Because the record establishes that (1) no particular education or expertise is required to perform firewatch work, (2) fire-watch work does not require a degree of skill, training, education or equipment not normally possessed outside the contract field, and (3) a comparison between Merit\u2019s firewatchers and Chevron\u2019s maintenance workers reveals that Chevron\u2019s employees possess similar or greater skill, training, experience, education and equipment for performing firewatch work,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> we find that the Brocks have failed to establish that a genuine issue of material fact exists as to whether firewatch. work is specialized.</p>\n<p id=\"b1055-4\">2</p>\n<p id=\"b1055-5\">Because firewatching is non-specialized work, we must consider the Brocks\u2019 assertion that firewatch work is not part of the trade, business, and occupation of Chevron. We find that, although Chevron may contract for firewatch work, firewatch work is part of Chevron\u2019s trade, business, and occupation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1055-6\">It is undisputed that Chevron supplied all the equipment used by Delays and the other firewatchers. In <em>Mozeke, </em>856 F.2d at 726, we found that contract work was part of the principal\u2019s business where the principal \u201cprovided the equipment necessary for [the contractor] to perform its maintenance and repair work at the ... plant, and that [the principal\u2019s] personnel at other Louisiana plants were capable of performing the same work...\u201d Moreover, the record establishes that firewatch work is regular, predictable, and necessary for the safe operation of the Chevron plant, <em>see Garrene v. BASF Wyandotte Corp., </em>532 So.2d 510, 512 (La.App. 1st Cir.1988) (plaintiff\u2019s maintenance activity is part of the routine and customary day-to-day operation of the plant), and that nearby chemical plants\u2014 namely British Petroleum and Murphy Oil Company \u2014 train their own people to perform firewatch work and do not contract for supplemental firewatch labor. Accordingly, we find that the Brocks have failed to successfully rebut the evidence presented by Chevron establishing that the fire-watch work performed by Delays is within the scope of Chevron\u2019s trade, business, and occupation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1055-9\">3</p>\n<p id=\"b1055-10\">Having found that the firewatch work performed by Delays at the time of his injury was (1) non-specialized and (2) within the scope of Chevron\u2019s trade, business, and occupation, we reach the Brocks\u2019 final contention \u2014 that Chevron employees were not performing firewatch work at the time of Delays\u2019 accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b1055-11\">The third prong of the <em>Berry </em>test does not require that a principal\u2019s employees perform exactly the same work as the con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"974\">*974</page-number>tract employees, <em>see Mozeke, </em>856 F.2d at 727, 727 n. 3 (principal\u2019s employees need not be performing contract work on same premises as contractor\u2019s employees; similar work at oth\u00e9r facilities may be sufficient), nor that the principal\u2019s employees be working side-by-side with the contract employees. <em>See id.; Seeney, </em>848 F.2d at 668 (a showing that principal\u2019s employees were performing similar work somewhere on the premises at the time of the accident is sufficient).</p>\n<p id=\"b1056-4\">The record firmly establishes that, at the time of Delays\u2019 accident, all Chevron maintenance workers were trained in fire prevention and fire-fighting; these skills were part of their job duties. Moreover, according to Chevron\u2019s maintenance superintendent <em>(see supra </em>note 6), Chevron employees routinely perform firewatch duties as part of their maintenance operations. To establish that Chevron was not engaged in any firewatch-related work at the time of Delays accident, the Brocks rely entirely upon Lalonde\u2019s testimony that he \u201ccannot remember\u201d firewatch work being performed by Chevron employees. We conclude that this is not enough to rebut Chevron\u2019s <em>Berry </em>showing that it was performing fire-watch work \u2014 work that Chevron has established (1) its employees are trained to perform, (2) includes general fire prevention efforts, and (3) is essentially maintenance in nature <em>{see supra </em>Part III.B.l) \u2014 at the time of Delays\u2019 accident.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1056-5\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b1056-6\">In sum, we have determined that Chevron has successfully established that, under the <em>Berry </em>test formulated by the Louisiana Supreme Court, Delays Brock was its statutory employee at the time of his accident. As recognized by the district court, this determination is supported by the fact that, at the time he was initially employed by Merit, Delays signed an acknowledgment stating,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1056-8\">I understand that although I am the general employee of the contractor noted below, I will also have a special employee relationship with Chevron Chemical Company during the performance of work at a Chevron Chemical Company Plant. I accept the special employee relationship and I understand that as a result of this relationship the responsibility, if any, of Chevron Chemical Company for injuries or death shall be limited, similar to that of my general employer, to benefits available under applicable worker\u2019s compensation law....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1056-9\">I agree to abide by the safety rules applicable to plant employees and to follow the directions of representatives of Chevron Chemical Company in performance of work.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1056-10\">The Brocks have failed to successfully rebut Chevron\u2019s showing by \u201ccom[ing] forward with evidence establishing each of the challenged elements of its case for which [the Brocks would] bear the burden of proof at trial.\u201d <em>Topalian, </em>954 F.2d at 1131, <em>citing Catrett, </em>477 U.S. at 322, 106 S.Ct. at 2552. Accordingly, having reviewed the record as a whole, we find that, pursuant to La.Rev.Stat.Ann. \u00a7 23:1061 (West 1985) (pre-1990 amendment version), Delays was Chevron\u2019s statutory employee at the time of his accident. We therefore conclude that, pursuant to Rule 56(c) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Chevron is, as a matter of law, entitled to summary judgment on the issue of tort liability arising from Delays\u2019 accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b1056-11\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b1056-12\">For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in favor of Chevron.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1052-8\">. Firewatchers are responsible for ensuring that an area is safe for welders and others performing \"hot work\u201d \u2014 work involving combustible equipment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1052-18\">. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(e); <em>Rally\u2019s, </em>939 F.2d at 1263.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1053-10\">.

The court held that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1053-17\">While certainly he had to be trained to do the work, i.e., taught what his job was and instructed in fire[-]fighting, the work he was performing was not specialized work. His duties consisted of covering drains, cleaning up oil spills, and standing by with fire[-]fighting equipment while hot work was being done. He was not performing technical work which required extensive and detailed education and/or training.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ACWO\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"972\">*972</page-number>The court focused upon the skeletal background requirements for firewatchers \u2014 the ability to read and write English, communicate with plant personnel, take and follow directions, fight fires, stay alert and react to changing conditions, endure heights and enclosed places, and lift 50 pounds. The court also acknowledged the minimal amount of training subsequent to being hired \u2014 watching a film illustrating working in confined spaces and the proper tagging procedures, instruction on the propensities of chemicals produced and stored at the Chevron plant, general orientation to the plant, instruction to look for spilled oil and grease, and training on proper handling of fire-fighting equipment. The total training time lasts approximately one-half of a day, and the only other requirement is that firewatchers attend a monthly fire-fighting training session with Chevron employees.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1055-7\">. <em>See, e.g., Saaverda v.

The Brocks have not explicitly briefed why they raise this issue and how it weighs upon their claims. In response, we simply note that the record establishes that Chevron chose to hire many of its workers through contractual relationships and, inevitably, these Chevron workers did work together. For example, because Chevron coordinated and assigned work to a number of contractors, Merit often\u2014 at Chevron's direction \u2014 provided firewatch services to other contractors who also worked under Chevron\u2019s direction.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
