United States, </em>931 F.2d 879 (Fed.Cir.1991) <em>(Bosco I), </em>insofar as it affirmed the Claims Court\u2019s Tucker Act jurisdiction over a suit under the \u201cprevailing rate\u201d wage legislation (PR Act), Pub.L. No. 92-392, 86 Stat. 564 (1972) (codified as amended at 5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 5341-5349 (1988)). The suit challenged the legality of the reclassification by the Internal Revenue\" Service (IRS) of positions held by Stephen Bosco and the other federal employees (collectively Bosco), and in it they requested lost pay. We held first that the Claims Court did have jurisdiction and second that the reclassification was lawful. The government challenges our first holding.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-19\">At the invitation of the court, Bosco filed a response to the government\u2019s petition. The court granted the Petition for Rehearing and, <em>sua sponte, </em>ordered oral argument. After reviewing the original briefs, the new submissions, and hearing a second oral argument, for the reasons stated below we maintain our prior holding that the Claims Court did have subject matter jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-20\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-21\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-22\">The premise of the government\u2019s main argument on rehearing is that since, as ordered, the reclassification of the mail processing equipment operator positions from the \u201cPrevailing Rate\u201d (PR) system to the General Schedule (GS) entitled Bosco to receive grade and pay retention benefits, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 5362 &amp; 5363 (1988), the Civil Service Reform Act (CSRA) and not the PR Act governs the rights of those affected by the reclassification.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Canvassing the legis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"712\">*712</page-number>lative history of the CSRA, the government argues that 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 5366(b) (1988) has implicitly eliminated the Claims Court\u2019s Tucker Act jurisdiction over Bosco\u2019s suit pursuant to the PR Act.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Moreover, the government contends that we incorrectly distinguished <em>United States v. Fausto, </em>484 U.S. 439, 108 S.Ct. 668, 98 L.Ed.2d 830 (1988), in our original decision, <em>Bosco I, </em>931 F.2d at 883, as the present case falls within the logic of <em>Fausto </em>because the CSRA covers this reclassification. The government reads <em>Fausto </em>as establishing the proposition that the CSRA provides the exclusive review procedures for any type of personnel action the statute covers in any way. However, upon reexamination of the CSRA, its legislative history, and case law, we conclude the government\u2019s construction is incorrect.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-4\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-5\">Section 5366(b) of title 5 provides,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AKpg\">(b) For purposes of any appeal procedures</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b889-6\">(1) <em>any </em>action which is the basis of an individual\u2019s entitlement to benefits under this subchapter <em>[i.e., </em>grade and <em>pay </em>retention], ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b889-7\">shall not be treated as appealable under such appeals procedures____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AgFt\">(Emphasis added). The nature and scope of \u201cappeal procedures\u201d are defined in chapter 77 of title 5, and refer to the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB or Board) appeal process for adverse personnel actions. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7701 (1988).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> That Congress crafted a separate section to treat judicial review of MSPB decisions, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7703 (1988), further supports our conclusion that Congress intended \u201cappeal procedures\u201d to be strictly limited to MSPB appeals. If we were to agree with the government, therefore, we must construe \u201cany\u201d as intended to sweep within section 5366(b) longstanding Claims Court review of a PR Act claim under its Tucker Act jurisdiction. Our perusal of the legislative history reveals that Congress in no way manifested an intention in section 5366(b) to preempt preexisting causes of action outside the civil service system.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-15\">According to the House Committee Report accompanying the bill that dealt with grade and pay retention benefits,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b889-16\">Subsection (b) of section 5367 [(now 5366) ] provides that any action which is the basis of an individual\u2019s entitlement to benefits under subchapter VI [(grade and pay retention) ] ... shall not be treated as an adverse action for purposes of any appeal procedures. This subsection is not intended to prohibit the filing of classification appeals (such as under part 511 of the Commission\u2019s [ (now OPM\u2019s)] regulations)____ Rather, <em>subsection (b) is intended to prohibit the filing of adverse action appeals </em>based on downgrading actions____ Under subsection (b) the following actions would not constitute adverse actions for purposes of appeals procedures:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b889-19\">1. Reduction of employee to lower grade as a result of reclassification of position;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b889-20\">* <em>* </em>* * * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b889-21\">House Comm, on Post Office and Civil Service, Grade and Pay Retention for Certain Employees, H.R.Rep. No. 994, 95th Cong., 2d Sess. 15 (1978) (emphasis added). Congress,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> in enacting section 5366(b), sought <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"713\">*713</page-number>to bar \u201cadverse action appeals\u201d for certain otherwise appealable agency personnel actions.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Similarly, section 7513(d) of title 5 addresses \u201cadverse action appeals\u201d and is restricted to administrative appeals to the MSPB. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7513(d) (1988). Accordingly, the legislative history and context indicate that in section 5366(b) Congress only expressly dealt with MSPB appeals and was silent with respect to Claims Court or district court consideration of a PR Act claim because it did not intend to affect the latter.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-5\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-6\">Nor are we persuaded that <em>Fausto </em>requires us to expand the plain meaning of the statutory language and ignore the history to create an implication that section 5366(b) also prohibits Claims Court consideration of Bosco\u2019s PR Act claim. The Supreme Court in <em>Fausto </em>focussed on \u201cprecisely drawn provisions\u201d with respect to Board and judicial review of adverse actions of any type within chapter 75 of the CSRA to infer a congressional judgment to preclude Board and judicial review altogether of adverse actions against nonpreference eligible excepted service employees. 484 U.S. at 448-49, 108 S.Ct. at 674-75 (citation omitted). But as we have determined, because of pay and grade retention, Bosco\u2019s downgrading pursuant to his position reclassification was not an adverse action. Additionally, while the Supreme Court emphasized the \u201cattention that [the CSRA] gives throughout to the rights of nonpreference excepted service employees,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 448, 108 S.Ct. at 674, we do not find comparable attention in the statute to the review rights of \u201cprevailing rate\u201d employees. In these respects, Fausto\u2019s holdings are inapposite to this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-12\">Even if we were to read <em>Fausto </em>as broadly as the government does, its logic may militate against judicially expanding section 5366(b). The government ignores the differences between the nature of the CSRA provisions considered in <em>Fausto </em>and the negative dictate of section 5366(b). That is, whereas 5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 7511, 7513(d), 7701, and 7703 (1988) affirmatively grant a form of judicial review to some but not all federal employees, section 5366(b) precludes Board review for certain otherwise appealable agency actions. <em>Cf. </em>5 U.S.C. \u00a7 4303(e) (1988) (affirmatively defining review rights for specific categories of employees). Applying the approach of the Supreme Court, that the CSRA is complete and exclusive in the areas it expressly governs, the CSRA leaves undisturbed Bosco\u2019s PR Act right to seek relief under the Tucker Act here from the Claims Court.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In other words, since section 5366(b) bars only one specific type of (administrative) review, a second distinct type of (judicial) review is beyond the scope of the provision.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b891-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"714\">*714</page-number>More concretely, to hold that the CSRA provides the sole review procedures for any personnel action it mentions, which the government maintains <em>Fausto </em>requires, would render the PR Act largely, if not totally, superfluous as unenforceable.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In effect, the PR Act would be abrogated for federal employees. This outcome stands in stark contrast to the ramification of the holding in <em>Fausto </em>on the Back Pay Act. The Supreme Court explained that it did not implicitly repeal the Back Pay Act. Rather, its holding only altered a judicially-created implication so that \u201cthe Claims Court (and any other court relying on Tucker Act jurisdiction) is not an \u2018appropriate authority\u2019 to review an agency\u2019s personnel determination.\u201d <em>Fausto, </em>484 U.S. at 454, 108 S.Ct. at 677. But the implications of the government\u2019s position in the instant case would not be limited to courts relying on Tucker Act jurisdiction. The government would foreclose by implication all forms of judicial review (such as under the Administrative Procedure Act) of reclassifications with grade and pay retention, thereby obliterating at least the cause of action under the PR Act. This extreme result is necessarily so because section 5366(b), unlike the provisions construed in <em>Fausto, </em>is phrased in negative terms, and because there is no principled way to distinguish here between Claims Court Tucker Act review and any other avenues for trial court review. We cannot sanction such violence to the PR Act without even a hint from Congress that it intended such changes, and therefore leave undisturbed what the statute does not expressly extinguish.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-4\">The government also misapprehends the policy basis of <em>Fausto; </em>the Supreme Court grounded its holding in the peculiar context of adverse personnel actions. Such actions necessarily focus on the agency\u2019s appraisal of the misconduct of a particular employee. By contrast, reclassifications have nothing to do with appraisals of the actions of individual employees. Neither the traditional desire to remove institutional barriers against necessary disciplinary actions against individual employees, <em>id. </em>at 445, 108 S.Ct. at 672, nor the avoidance of \u201cinverted preference\u201d shown to particular \u201cdisfavored\u201d classes of employees, <em>id. </em>at 449-50, 108 S.Ct. at 674-75, is relevant to the facts of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-9\">And the government has complained to the wrong forum about the potential lack of consistency in decision making due to the absence of a single, comprehensive authority like the MSPB, and about two layers of judicial review. <em>See id. </em>at 451, 108 S.Ct. at 675. Congress, through section 5366(b), chose to bar MSPB appeals of re-classifications with grade and pay retention benefits, but was silent in regard to other forms of review. This seems to us to evidence a deliberate congressional choice to preserve what it did not explicitly take away. Any objections based on concerns over consistency and repetitive judicial review should be brought before Congress.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> We will not second guess the wisdom of Congress\u2019 choice and modify the plain meaning of a statute in order to produce what the government deems a wise result. <em>See Volk v. Hobson, </em>866 F.2d 1398, 1403 (Fed.Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>490 U.S. 1092, 109 S.Ct. 2435, 104 L.Ed.2d 991 (1989) (acknowledging \u201cthe logic inherent in the Supreme Court\u2019s admonitions to leave the architecture of the federal personnel system to Congress.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b891-10\">Judicial restraint also directs us to sustain the Claims Court\u2019s jurisdiction despite the government\u2019s assertion that <em>\u201cBosco </em>[I] effectively stands the CSRA on its head by according greater <em>appeal rights </em>to reclassified employees who receive pay and grade retention benefits than reclassified employ<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"715\">*715</page-number>ees who suffer a reduction in pay or grade.\u201d Petition for Rehearing and Suggestion for Rehearing In Banc <em>[hereinafter </em>Rehearing Petition] at 15 (emphasis added). Nothing we hold today deals with \u201cappeal rights,\u201d which, as noted earlier, are limited to review by the MSPB, but only the right to sue in a trial court under the PR Act. In any event, whatever comparative review advantages, if any, Bosco may enjoy over those reclassified employees without grade and pay retention benefits is a consequence of congressional judgment. Moreover, the government fails to cite any authority that has determined that direct access to the trial court is superior to MSPB review in the first instance. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b892-5\">D.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-6\">The government does not point to, nor have we found, any evidence in the legislative history that Congress was seeking to streamline the civil service by abrogating judicial review rights for personnel actions unrelated to an individual\u2019s performance. Specifically, we detect no congressional disfavor of PR Act claims. Such congressional silence has particular significance balanced against a mere judicial gloss as the government advocates on a meticulously drafted statute, especially when the right to bring the PR Act action in the Claims Court was well established. Moreover, we are mindful of \u201cthe strong presumption that Congress intends judicial review of administrative action.\u201d <em>Traynor v. Turnage, </em>485 U.S. 535, 542, 108 S.Ct. 1372, 1378, 99 L.Ed.2d 618 (1988) (quoting <em>Bowen v. Michigan Academy of Family Physicians, </em>476 U.S. 667, 670, 106 S.Ct. 2133, 2135, 90 L.Ed.2d 623 (1986)) (post-<em>Fausto </em>decision, although in a different legal context). The government has failed to cite any evidence of a contrary congressional intent. <em>See id. </em>(confirming that \u201c[t]he presumption in favor of judicial review may be overcome \u2018only upon a showing of \u201cclear and convincing evidence\u201d of a contrary legislative intent.\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>Abbott Laboratories v. Gardner, </em>387 U.S. 136, 141, 87 S.Ct. 1507, 1511, 18 L.Ed.2d 681 (1967))). Therefore, we reiterate our prior holding that the CSRA does not divest the Claims Court of Tucker Act jurisdiction over Bosco\u2019s PR Act claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-9\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-10\">The government further contends that the transfer of Bosco\u2019s positions from the PR system to the GS is \u201ccovered by chapter 23 of the CSRA because such action[] may be challenged as [a] prohibited personnel praetice[ ]\u201d violating merit system principles. Rehearing Petition at 12. <em>See </em>5 U.S.C. \u00a7 2302(b)(11) (1988). As Bosco\u2019s allegations under the PR Act constitute a prohibited personnel practice, the government reasons, before suing in court Bosco must first request review by the Office of Special Counsel. .Rehearing Petition at 12 (citing <em>National Treasury Employees Union v. Egger, </em>783 F.2d 1114, 1116-17 (D.C.Cir.1986) (holding that IRS\u2019 reclassification actions \u2014 which we upheld in <em>Bosco I\u2014 </em>alleged in Administrative Procedure Act claims may be a prohibited personnel practice)). That Bosco did not do. Furthermore, section 2302(d), 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 2302(d) (1988), according to the government, lists the only \u201cclaims [that] could still be pursued in the federal courts in the first instance.\u201d Rehearing Petition at 14. Since Bosco\u2019s claims are not on that list per the government, the CSRA has extinguished direct access to the courts under the PR Act. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b892-11\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-12\">We believe the government\u2019s arguments are flawed in their premise. Bosco\u2019s allegations of PR Act violations do not constitute grounds for a prohibited personnel practice cognizable by chapter 23 of the CSRA. Indeed, section 2302, the provision defining prohibited personnel practices for purposes of title 5, does not include agency actions affecting \u201cprevailing rate\u201d employees as a \u201cpersonnel action.\u201d <em>See </em>5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2302(a)(2)(A) &amp; (B) (1988). Nor is there any legislative history that shows that in enacting what became section 2302, Con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"716\">*716</page-number>gress even thought about PR Act claims. And for reasons parallel to those expressed in parts II.C. and D. for section 5366(b), we decline judicially to extend the precisely-worded section 2302 by assuming it was intended to include additional limitations not stated. Accordingly, we hold Bosco\u2019s PR Act claims are wholly beyond the scope of chapter 23,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and the CSRA does not affect Bosco\u2019s right to seek Claims Court review. <em>See Bradley v. United States, </em>870 F.2d 1578, 1580 (Fed.Cir.1989) (determining that the PR Act is a money-mandating statute and can thus provide a cause of action under the Tucker Act jurisdiction of the Claims Court).</p>\n<p id=\"b893-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-5\">Before oral argument on rehearing, Bosco filed a Motion to Dismiss for Want of a Live Controversy. Bosco contends that after our original decision in this appeal, there is no longer an ongoing article III \u201ccase or controversy\u201d between the parties because Bosco has no personal stake and could not gain anything from the outcome of this rehearing. However, as we are reopening the decision, albeit merely for clarifying and expressing additional reasons for our prior conclusion concerning the issue of whether the CSRA divested Claims Court jurisdiction over appellants\u2019 claims, Bosco\u2019s motion is misdirected. Once we granted rehearing, the original decision is set aside and the appeal is revived; it therefore cannot be said that the case or controversy present then has disappeared.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-6\">Accordingly, IT IS ORDERED that:</p>\n<p id=\"b893-7\">(1) With the additional reasons discussed above to uphold Claims Court jurisdiction, this court\u2019s decision and opinion in <em>Bosco v. United States, </em>931 F.2d 879 (Fed.Cir.1991), are reinstated, unchanged.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-9\">(2) Boseo\u2019s Motion to Dismiss for Want of a Live Controversy is denied.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b888-14\">. In the response, Bosco attacks the government\u2019s premise by emphasizing that the named plaintiffs are also asserting claims on behalf of unnamed \"similarly situated individuals\u201d whom the IRS hired after its reclassification action. Those individuals, Bosco asserts, did not obtain any grade and pay retention benefits and only received rates of pay under the GS. We need not and do not, however, reach any issue that this fact may raise because we conclude that the Claims Court had jurisdiction over the claims of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"712\">*712</page-number>those employees who were afforded grade and pay retention benefits.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b889-11\">. The government does not take issue with this court's conclusion in <em>Bradley v. United States, </em>870 F.2d 1578, 1580 (Fed.Cir.1989), that the PR Act is a money-mandating statute giving rise to Claims Court jurisdiction under the Tucker Act.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b889-12\">. To be precise, section 7701 refers in its section heading to \"Appellate procedures.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b889-22\">. The Conference Committee diminished the grade protection component of the House bill, limiting the grade retention period in reclassification cases to two years. Conference Report on the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978, S.Rep. No. 1272, 95th Cong., 2d Sess. 160 (1978), <em>reprinted in </em>1978 U.S.C.C.A.N. 2723, 2894. But there is no evidence that suggests that the conferees diverged from the House Committee\u2019s explanation for the purpose of the precursor to section 5366. We therefore believe that the changes at Conference are immaterial to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"713\">*713</page-number>instant case, and that the House Report embodies the limited effects of what Congress contemplated by enacting section 5366. <em>See Atwell v.

The method chosen for this purpose was deeming actions with concomitant grade and pay retention not to be adverse actions at all. <em>See Atwell, 670 </em>F.2d at 285-86 (holding that a reduction in grade referred to in 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7512(3) (1988) \u2014 a provision within the chapter on adverse actions of the CSRA \u2014 is limited to downgrading actions <em>without </em>grade or pay retention benefits).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b890-9\">. Because of Bosco\u2019s receipt of grade and pay retention benefits under the CSRA, the government takes exception to our statement, \"the instant case involves a type of personnel action not covered at all by the CSRA.\u201d <em>Bosco I, </em>931 F.2d at 883. The government has pulled the statement out of its narrow context. The sen-fences preceding the quoted statement make plain that \"personnel action\" means an adverse action within chapter 75 of the CSRA. <em>Id. </em>But Bosco did not suffer an adverse action within the contemplation of chapter 75. <em>See supra </em>note 4. And in this sense, IRS\u2019 downgrading action is \"not covered at all by the CSRA.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b890-14\">. At one point in its petition, the government urges us to adhere to the \"well-established principle of statutory construction: where Congress expressly enumerates certain exceptions from the statute, additional exceptions should not be implied in the absence of evidence of a contrary legislative intent.\u201d Petition for Rehearing and Suggestion for Rehearing In Banc at 14 (citation omitted). The principle, as stated, is irrelevant to the issues raised under section 5366(b). However, a necessary corollary of this principle for statutes that prohibit certain actions, such as section 5366(b), is that additional prohibitions should not be implied absent specific legislative intent. Utilizing the allowable application of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"714\">*714</page-number>the method for statutory construction that the government advocates therefore actually undermines its position.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b891-6\">. Bosco has alleged that the IRS\u2019 conversion of the positions to the GS violated the PR Act. The government does not, and indeed could not, deny that the PR Act mandates the payment of money, <em>see, e.g., Bradley v. United States, </em>870 F.2d 1578, 1580 (Fed.Cir.1989), and thus would otherwise form the predicate of a cause of action for lost pay within the Tucker Act jurisdiction of the Claims Court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b891-12\">.
