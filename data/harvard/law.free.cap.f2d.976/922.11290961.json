SMITH, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b1005-4\">The plaintiffs, who are former employees of Schlumberger Technology Corp. (\u201cSchlumberger\u201d), brought suit against that company for breach of an employment contract. Schlumberger removed to federal court on the ground that the cause of. action is preempted by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (\u201cERISA\u201d), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001 <em>et seq. </em>In a thorough and persuasive memorandum and order, the district court granted Schlumber-ger\u2019s motion for summary judgment, denying any recovery to the plaintiffs. We agree with the district court\u2019s analysis and, accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-6\">The plaintiffs basically claim a denial of severance pay under a provision of the company\u2019s management policy manual that had provided for severance pay in lieu of notice of termination. That policy was amended on December 22, 1988, to provide that, unlike the previous provision, an employee was not entitled to pay in lieu of notice, where he or she was released from employment before the expiration of a prescribed period of notice of termination, if he or she was offered full-time employment by a company acquiring the division of Schlumberger in which the employee worked.</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-7\">The plaintiffs worked in the MACCO Division of Schlumberger, which was purchased by Arrow Oil Tools (\u201cArrow\u201d) on February 28, 1989. Apparently, the amended severance plan was adopted after plans were made for the purchase by Arrow, although it became effective before the sale took place. The plaintiffs, however, seek severance pay under the former provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-9\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-10\">The plaintiffs first argue that federal jurisdiction is wanting because the Schlumberger plan is not an ERISA employee welfare benefit plan. ERISA defines a covered \u201cemployee welfare benefit plan\u201d as one that provides \u201c(A) ... benefits in the event of sickness, accident, disability, death or unemployment ... or (B) any benefit described in [section 302(c) of the Labor-Management Relations Act].\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1002(1). Benefits under section 302(c) of the Labor-Management Relations Act include \u201c... pooled vacation, holiday, severance or similar benefits_\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 186(c)(6).</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-14\">The plaintiffs depart from the plain meaning of these provisions to argue that Schlumberger\u2019s severance pay in lieu. of notice is not an ERISA plan in light of <em>Fort Halifax Packing Co. v. Coyne, </em>482 U.S. 1, 107 S.Ct. 2211, 96 L.Ed.2d 1 (1987), and <em>Wells v. General Motors Corp., </em>881 F.2d 166 (5th Cir.1989), <em>cert. denied, </em>495 U.S. 923, 110 S.Ct. 1959, 109 L.Ed.2d 321 (1990). As the district observed, however, these eases are distinguishable. <em>Fort Halifax </em>involved a state law requiring severance pay, without establishment of a plan, and <em>Wells </em>involved a one-time severance obligation without the ongoing administration of benefits that is required of an ERISA plan. Schlumberger\u2019s plan, on the other hand, was not created with a particular closing in mind and had been in existence for some time.</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-15\">The plaintiffs concede that \u201cordinarily, unfunded single employer severance policies are benefit plans within the Scope [sic] of ERISA.\u201d Their argument that the Schlumberger plan is self-executing and thus does not require \u201cadministration\u201d is to no avail, as we perceive nothing about the Schlumberger plan to take it out of the ordinary definition of an ERISA plan. Moreover, the plan plainly required some sort of an administrative set-up in order to make payments to employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-16\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-17\">The plaintiffs assert that if the Schlumberger plan is an ERISA plan, Schlumberger violated it by failing fully to disclose the terms of the amendment to the employees prior to their termination. The plaintiffs concede, however., that the amendment \u201ctechnically occurred] before the employees\u2019 termination.\u201d Even if this concession were not enough, the district <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"924\">*924</page-number>court specifically found that Schlumberger complied with ERISA\u2019s disclosure requirements in that \u201cplaintiffs admit receiving copies of the amended severance ... plan on February 7, and admit receiving a summary description of this plan change on March 8, 1989.\u201d The plaintiffs do not dispute these facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-4\">The plaintiffs acknowledge that Schlum-berger gave notice within the time permitted by ERISA. They argue only that \u201csuch a technical reading of the disclosure provisions ... work [sic] an inequitable result and give [sic] effect to form over substance.\u201d We conclude, to the contrary, that Schlumberger was entitled to give notice within the statutory notice period and was not required to provide it sooner. The plaintiffs\u2019 argument is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-5\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-6\">The plaintiffs aver that their right to severance benefits had vested, precluding any amendment. They admit, however, that \u201cordinarily, severance benefits are unaccrued, unvested benefits which an employer has no continuing duty to provide.\u201d The strongest argument they can muster for the proposition that the instant severance benefits are vested is that they \u201chave been unable to find any case law which conclusively holds that, under ERISA, severance benefits never vest.\u201d In fact, severance benefits consistently have been held not to vest. <em>See, e.g., Reichelt v. Emhart Corp., </em>921 F.2d 425, 430 (2d Cir.1990), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 111 S.Ct. 2854, 115 L.Ed.2d 1022 (1991); <em>Young v. Standard Oil (Ind.), </em>849 F.2d 1039, 1045 (7th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>488 U.S. 981, 109 S.Ct. 529, 102 L.Ed.2d 561 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-9\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-10\">The plaintiffs argue that if the amended plan does not apply to them because of Schlumberger\u2019s failure to make proper disclosure, they are entitled to <em>de novo </em>review of the denial of their benefits. In light of our conclusion that the district court was correct in its determination that notice was legally sufficient, we need not consider this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-11\">The district court properly concluded that the plaintiffs are entitled to no relief. Its judgment, accordingly, is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
