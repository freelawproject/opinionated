On the contrary, the testimony of the witnesses for the Commonwealth plainly shows that the shooting was unintentional.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-6\">The main witness for the Commonwealth details the circumstances attending the shooting as follows: \u201cI had my right arm around his back and a hold of his right arm, when Luther Ratcliff rode up, and said \u2018howdy\u2019 or \u2018hello there boys.\u2019 The defendant replied \u2018hello there buddy,\u2019 and just as Ratcliff got his horse hitched, the pistol went off, and I said to the defendant, \u2018you have killed some one or shot somebody.\u2019 Luther Ratcliff walked on toward the schoolhouse, and just as he come into the light that shone from and out of the. schoolhouse door, the defendant said, \u2018Y, that\u2019s the mail boy; I would not hurt him for the world.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b607-7\">On cross-examination, he stated: \u201cIt was just an instant from the time they spoke to each other till the pistol fired. The defendant neither raised, lowered or moved the pistol in any way, when it went off, but just seemed to be still.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b607-9\">The accused and the boy shot had always been good friends and are still friendly.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-10\">It is so plain that the shooting was unintentional that it would be a waste of time to recite the evidence in detail. It is equally unnecessary to cite the .authorities <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>on unlawful maiming under section 4402 of the Code. They may be found in the notes to that section. \u2018 j</p>\n<p id=\"b608-4\">Th\u00e9 judgment of the circuit court will be reversed, the verdict of the jury set aside, and the case remanded for a new trial, if the Commonwealth shall be so advised.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-5\">\n<em>Reversed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
