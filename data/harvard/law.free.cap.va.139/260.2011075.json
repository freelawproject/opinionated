E. 506, and is ruled by the latter case and those of the same class therein mentioned.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-9\">As said in the <em>Bowman Case, </em>we say in this: \u201cWe have had occasion recently to pass upon many similar cases. The pertinent principles are well settled. After a most careful consideration of the evidence, we are of opinion that we cannot say as a matter of law that the plaintiff was guilty of contributory negligence; * * the instant ease is controlled by the line of cases typified by <em>Seaboard Air Line Ry. </em>v. <em>Abernathy, </em>121 Va. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>173, 92 S. E. 913, and <em>Payne, Director General, </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>133 Va. 222, 112 S. E. 833, and does not fall -within the influence of <em>Washington &amp; Old Dominion Ry. Co. </em>v. <em>Zell, </em>118 Va. 755, 88 S. E. 309, and other cases of that class.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b297-4\">We will add. that we find the evidence in the instant case, relied on by the defendant to support the contention that it is a case of negligence <em>per se </em>on the part of the plaintiff\u2019s intestate, to be much weaker than in the <em>Bowman Case.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b297-5\">The case will be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
