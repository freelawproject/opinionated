We hold that he does not, and accordingly affirm the circuit court\u2019s order dismissing his appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-11\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-12\">This is the last of three appeals brought by Theodore B. Jordan to challenge the certification of service fees charged by appellee Hawaii Government Employees\u2019 Association, Local 152, AFSCME, AFL-CIO (\u201cHGEA\u201d), pursuant to HRS \u00a7 89-4 as the exclusive representative of the bargaining unit to which appellant Jordan, a former University of Hawaii employee, belonged. <em>See Jordan v. Hamada, </em>64 Haw. 446, 643 P.2d 70 <em>1982); Jordan v. Hamada, </em>62 Haw. 444, 616 P.2d 1368 (1980). Because a full explanation of the service fee and some of the pertinent circumstances were related earlier in the above opinions, we shall recount only those facts which are necessary as a context for the issue appellant raises herein.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-13\">Appellee Hawaii Public Employment Relations Board (\u201cHPERB\u201d) issued its Decision No. 78 on July 28, 1977, in which it certified as reasonable the service fee which HGEA sought to impose on members of the six bargaining units it represented. The service fee was made retroactive to September 1, 1976. The decision also authorized the public employer to deduct the fee as certified from employees\u2019 salaries until such time as HPERB directed otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-14\">On September 23,1977, HGEA filed a petition with HPERB for certification of an increased service fee. Appellant intervened to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>challenge the proposed fee on statutory and constitutional grounds, but HPERB nonetheless certified the fee as reasonable in Decision No. 93 issued on October 20, 1978. The increased fee was declared retroactive to September 1, 1977, and the employer was accordingly authorized to deduct from the payrolls the difference between the newly certified service fee and the amount actually deducted for the period between September 1,1977 and the date of Decision No. 93. The full amount of the increased fee was to be deducted from the date of the decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-5\">Appellant retired from state employment on October 31, 1978, without paying the additional amounts reflecting the increased service fee, as Decision No. 93 was not implemented until January, 1979.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b467-6\">On November 21, 1978, appellant filed a notice of appeal with the first circuit court pursuant to HRS \u00a7 91 -14, again complaining of statutory and constitutional violations committed in HPERB\u2019s certification of HGEA\u2019s service fee. The court, however, dismissed the appeal by written order dated December 27, 1978, for the reason that appellant was not aggrieved by Decision No. 93 and therefore lacked standing to contest its validity. It is from this dismissal that Jordan now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-7\">n.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-8\">Standing, as characterized by this court in <em>Life of the Land, Inc. v. Land Use Commission, </em>63 Haw. 166, 623 P.2d 431 (1981), is that aspect of the requirement of a justiciable controversy for judicial intervention that focuses on the party seeking the forum rather than on the nature of the issues he wants resolved. <em>Id. </em>at 172,623 P.2d at 438. \u201cAnd the crucial inquiry in its determination is \u2018whether the plaintiff has \u201calleged such a personal stake in the outcome of the controversy\u201d as to warrant <em>his </em>invocation of .. . [the court\u2019s] jurisdiction and to justify exercise of the court\u2019s remedial powers on his behalf. <em>Warth v. Seldin, </em>(422 U.S. 490) at 498-99 (original emphasis).\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b467-9\">As codified by HAPA in HRS \u00a7 91-14 and interpreted by this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>court on numerous occasions, the concept of standing in the context of administrative appeals has two components. First, one must be a \u201cperson aggrieved,\u201d <em>inter alia, </em>\u201cby a final decision and order in a contested case.\u201d HRS \u00a7 91-14(a) (1976). Second, the aggrieved person must have participated in the contested case from which the decision affecting him resulted. <em>Id.; Life of the Land, Inc. v. Land Use Commission, </em>61 Haw. 3, 6, 594 P.2d 1079, 1081 (1979); <em>In re Application of Hawaiian Electric Company, </em>56 Haw. 260, 264, 535 P.2d 1102, 1105 (1975); <em>City and County v. P.U.C., </em>53 Haw. 431, 433, 495 P.2d 1180, 1182 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b468-6\">It is undisputed that appellant was allowed to intervene in the HPERB proceedings on the proposed service fee for the period beginning September 1,1977, a \u201ccontested case\u201d within the meaning of HRS \u00a7 91-1.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Appellant, however, initially posits that this fact alone entitles him to seek judicial review of Decision No. 93, as HPERB\u2019s granting him party status came in recognition of the direct pecuniary effect its decision would have on appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-7\">HRS \u00a791-14 quite clearly contradicts this contention by requiring that a person must be aggrieved by administrative action in order to appeal of right, and this determination is to be made at the time the right to appeal is asserted or attacked, not at the time of the appellant\u2019s intervention in the proceedings below. <em>Accord, In re Campbell\u2019s Estate, </em>46 Haw. 475, 499, 382 P.2d 920, 942 (1963). The mere fact that one has been permitted to intervene in an administrative proceeding, regardless of the existence of a justiciable interest at the time of the appeal, does not entitle one to pursue an appeal under HRS \u00a791-14. <em>See Honolulu Construction and Draying Company v. Terrace Developers, Ltd., </em>48 Haw. 68, 74, 395 P.2d 691, 696 (1964); <em>accord, Pittsburgh and West Virginia Railway Company v. United States, </em>281 U.S. 479, 486 (1930); <em>Terrill v. City of Tacoma, </em>195 Wash. 275, 277, 80 P.2d 858, 859 (1938).</p>\n<p id=\"b468-8\">The question of standing in this case thus resolves itself into a determination of whether appellant was \u201caggrieved\u201d by HPERB\u2019s Decision No. 93 so as to have a justiciable interest on appeal. In <em>East Diamond Head Association v. Zoning Board, 52 </em>Haw. 518, 479 P.2d 796 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>(1976), we adopted the definition of \u201cperson aggrieved\u201d as one who has been specially, personally and adversely affected by special injury or damage to his personal or property rights. <em>Id. </em>at 522, 479 P.2d at 798. There we held that an unincorporated landowners\u2019 association and some of its individual members had standing to challenge a variance which would have enabled an adjacent parcel to be used as a location for movie production, since the industrial use would immediately and directly affect each landowner. <em>Accord, Dalton v. City and County, </em>51 Haw. 400, 462 P.2d 199 (1969). Likewise, this court in <em>In re Application of Hawaiian Electric Company, supra, </em>recognized appellants\u2019 right under HAPA to appeal a Public Utilities Commission decision approving rate increases proposed by Hawaiian Electric Company since, as ratepayers subject to the higher charges, they were \u201cspecifically, personally and adversely affected\u201d by agency action. <em>Id. </em>at 264-65, 535 P.2d at 1105. This standard has also been applied in <em>Life of the Land, Inc. v. Land Use Commission, supra </em>(1981 case); <em>Life of the Land, Inc. v. Land Use Commission, supra </em>(1979 case); and <em>Waianae Model Neighborhood Area Association, Inc. v. City and County, 55 </em>Haw. 40, 514 P.2d 861 (1973), to find standing in the respective appellants based on substantial harm suffered or anticipated to property or personal interests, including aesthetic and environmental interests.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-5\">Appellant in the instant case claims to have been specifically, personally and adversely affected by HPERB\u2019s Decision No. 93 in two ways. First, because the decision declared the increased service fee effective retroactive to September 1, 1977 for employees on the payroll at that time, appellant maintains that the amounts deducted from his salary from that date, although admittedly not equivalent to the entire increased fee, represented part payments of the new fee under Decision No. 93. Second, appellant conjectures that he may still be liable to HGEA notwithstanding his retirement for the difference between the new service fee and amounts he actually paid from September 1, 1977 until his retirement by analogizing the effect of HPERB\u2019s decision to that of a judicial judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-6\">Despite its superficial logical appeal, appellant\u2019s argument fails to convince us that he was or will ever be personally affected by Decision No. 93. While it appears that that decision certified the entire service fee retroactive to September 1, 1977 and not just the increase over the previously certified fee, the fact remains that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>appellant did not pay any amounts reflecting the new fee since these amounts were not deducted from employees\u2019 salaries until after appellant retired. Therefore, the only amounts he paid between September 1, 1977 and the date of Decision No. 93, October 20, 1978, were authorized by Decision No. 78, which appellant is presently contesting in circuit court. <em>See Jordan v. Hamada, </em>64 Haw. 446, 643 P.2d 70 (1982). That the new fee was certified retroacdve to September 1,1977 does not alter the fact that the amounts appellant paid were authorized not by Decision No. 93 but by Decision No. 78.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"A9-\"><em>Richard Bender (James S. Campbell, Kent M. Keith </em>and <em>John R. Pingree </em>on the briefs, <em>Cades Schutte Fleming &amp; Wright </em>of counsel) for intervenor-appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"Af5\"><em>Benjamin C. Sigal (Shim, Sigal, Tam&amp; Naito, </em>a Law Corporation, of counsel) for petitioner-appellee.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"Acd\"><em>Glenn Choy (Sonia Faust </em>and <em>Linda K. Goto </em>on the brief) for appellees.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b470-6\">Moreover, appellant will not be liable in the future for amounts representing the increase in fee between September 1, 1977 and the date of his retirement, because HRS \u00a7 89-4 permits the public employer to deduct the service fee only \u201cfrom the payroll of every employee in the bargaining unit.\u201d An \u201cemployee\u201d for the purposes of HRS Chapter 89 is \u201cany person employed by a public employer.\u201d HRS \u00a7 89-2(7) (1976). HGEA\u2019s ability to charge appellant its service fee thus ceased on October 31,1978, when appellant terminated his employment with the University of Hawaii.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b470-7\">Because he has not and will not be affected by HPERB\u2019s Decision No. 93 as a retired employee, appellant Jordan is not a \u201cperson aggrieved\u201d within the meaning of HRS \u00a7 91-14 and consequently lacks standing to seek judicial review of the decision. The circuit court\u2019s dismissal of his appeal is sustained.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b467-10\"> Deductions for the full service fee and for amounts constituting the difference between the old and new service fees were to begin with thejanuary, 1979 payroll, the latter to be made in two lump sums.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b468-9\"><em> </em>\u201cContested case\u201d is defined by HRS \u00a7 91-1(5) (1976) as \u201ca proceeding in which the'\u00edegal rights, duties, or privileges of specific parties are required by law to be determined after an opportunity for agency hearing.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b470-11\"> This conclusion is reinforced by HPERB\u2019s Decision No. 29, in which the Board\u2019s majority expressed the opinion that HRS \u00a7 89-4 did not create a contractual obligation between the employee and the exclusive representative of the employee\u2019s bargaining unit for payment of the service fee. The statute was instead viewed as requiring payment of the fee in the form of a payroll deduction, which could not be made when the employee was not receiving any pay.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
