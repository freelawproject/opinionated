The March 1981 trial resulted injury verdicts pronouncing Stevens guilty on both murder counts, prompting Stevens to move for a judgment of acquittal or, in the alternative, for a new trial. Despite a prosecution attempt to prevent Judge Shintaku from ruling on the motion,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the judge orally granted the judgment of acquittal on September 28, 1981, and articulated his reasons therefor in a lengthy written decision and order filed on October 6,1981. The State now entreats this court to issue a writ of mandamus directing Judge Shintaku or his successor in office to vacate the judgment of acquittal, to reinstate the conviction previously entered pursuant to the jury verdicts, and to sentence Stevens accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-8\">The government\u2019s petition alleges the existence of exceptional circumstances justifying the issuance of mandamus in this case, namely, (a) thatjudge Shintaku erroneously applied the \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d standard of review to the facts before him when ruling on defendant\u2019s motion for judgment of acquittal, and (b) that the judge exceeded the scope of his review powers by invading the province of the jury in weighing the evidence and the credibility of the witnesses. The government additionally claims that the judge abused his discretion by viewing the conflicting evidence in a light most favorable to the defendant which, in combination with the above-mentioned eri'ors, led to the wrongful granting of the judgment of acquittal.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-9\">Before we may reach these substantive issues, however, we must initially address the threshold question of whether this court may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>properly entertain the petition and grant the relief sought under the particular circumstances of this case.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Cf. Chung v. Ogata, </em>54 Haw. 146, 148, 504 P.2d 868, 870 (1972) (prohibition).</p>\n<p id=\"b323-5\">HRS \u00a7 602-5(4), (6) and (7) (1976 &amp; Supp. 1981) expressly confer jurisdiction upon this court to grant the type of relief requested.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Nevertheless, because the object of mandamus is to supplement, not supersede legal remedies in extraordinary cases, a court will not be warranted in issuing mandamus unless it appears from the petition that petitioner has a \u201cclear and indisputable\u201d legal right to performance of a duty owed by respondent, <em>Will v. United States, </em>389 U.S. 90, 96 (1967); <em>Bankers Life &amp; Casualty Co. v. Holland, </em>346 U.S. 379, 384 (1953), and that petitioner lacks other means of adequately redressing the wrong or of obtaining the relief sought. <em>Roche v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number><em>Evaporated Milk Association, </em>319 U.S. 21, 27-28 (1943); J. High, A Treatise on Extraordinary Legal Remedies 15 (3d ed. 1896); <em>see United States ex rel. Girard Trust Co. v. Helvering, </em>301 U.S. 540, 544 (1936).</p>\n<p id=\"b324-6\">In its petition and supplemental brief, the government submits that HRS \u00a7 641-13 (1976 &amp; Supp. 1981) precludes further review of the judgment of acquittal by way of appeal, and contends accordingly that mandamus remains the sole means by which J udge Shintaku\u2019s allegedly erroneous actions may be rectified.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-7\">This court\u2019s ability to grant the extraordinary relief requested under the facts before it, however, is precluded at the outset by our previous ruling in <em>Chambers v. Leavey, </em>60 Haw. 52, 57, 587 P.2d 807, 810 (1978), that mandamus may not be used to perform the office of an appeal. <em>See also State ex rel. McClung v. Fukushima, </em>53 Haw. 295, 300, 492 P.2d 128, 131 (1972). As we pointed out in <em>Chambers, supra, </em>the right of appeal is not inchoate and exists only when granted by constitution or statute. <em>See Samuel Mahelona Memorial Hospital v. County of Kauai Civil Service Commission, </em>46 Haw. 260, 263, 377 P.2d 703, 705 (1962); <em>In re Sprinkle </em>&amp; <em>Chow Liquor License, </em>40 Haw. 485, 491 (1954). HRS \u00a7 641-13 (1976 &amp; Supp. 1981), conferring this right of appeal on the state in criminal cases in a limited number of enumerated instances, does not include in its enumeration a judgment of acquittal.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Compelled as we are to strictly construe HRS \u00a7 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>641-13 and its predecessor statutes,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>State v. Johnson, 50 </em>Haw. <em>525, </em>526, 445 P.2d 36, 37 (1968), especially in view of the double-jeopardy concerns implicated in the criminal appellate situation, <em>Will v. United States, supra; United States v. Weinstein, </em>511 F.2d 622, 626 (2d Cir. 1975), we find that this jurisdiction has long adhered to a legislative policy of denying the State the right of appeal from a judgment of acquittal such as that entered by Judge Shintaku in the Stevens case. The rule of <em>Chambers </em>must therefore apply to this situation in which the legislature has deliberately forbidden a State appeal. The mere fact that other remedies are not available has never in itself been sufficient justification for mandamus, <em>In re Application of Liverpool, </em>14 Haw. 481, 488 (1902); <em>cf. Chung v. Ogata, supra </em>at 150, 504 P.2d at 871 (prohibition), but where the legislature has so clearly expressed its intent to specifically deny government appeals from judgments of acquittal, it must follow from <em>Chambers </em>that an extraordinary writ may not be used to circumvent that intent or this court\u2019s duty to respect it.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>Cf. Will v. United States, supra </em>(use of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>mandamus as substitute for appeal in derogation of policies behind federal Criminal Appeals Act forbidden).</p>\n<p id=\"b326-6\">We recognize, as we have in the past, that the extraordinary writ may nonetheless issue to confine an inferior tribunal to the lawful exercise of its property risdiction, or to require it to act in accordance with its prescribed powers when it was its duty to do so.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>See Will v. United States, supra; Roche v. Evaporated Milk Association, supra </em>at 26; <em>In re Application of Liverpool, supra </em>at 489; <em>In re Waterhouse, </em>2 Haw. 241, 244 (1860). Where the trial judge has discretion to act, however, mandamus clearly will not lie to interfere with or control the exercise of that discretion, even where the judge has acted erroneously, <em>In re Tactacan, </em>42 Haw. 141, 142-43 (1957); <em>In re Application of Lorigan, </em>25 Haw. 445, 451 (1920); <em>In re Application of Liverpool, supra </em>at 488, unless, as stated above, the judge has exceeded his jurisdiction, has committed a flagrant and manifest abuse of discretion, <em>Fong v. Sapienza, </em>39 Haw. 79, 81 (1951<em>);</em><footnotemark><em>8</em></footnotemark><em> Alice National Bank v. Edwards, </em>408 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>S.W.2d 307 (Tex. Civ. App. 1966), or has refused to act on a subject properly before the court where it was under a legal duty to <em>act</em><footnotemark><em>9</em></footnotemark><em> In re Application of Lorigan, supra; In re Application of Liverpool, supra.</em></p>\n<attorneys id=\"An4\"><em>Arthur E.

Chuck, </em>Attorney at Law, a Law Corporation), for respondent Harold Y. Shintaku.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b327-5\">in granting the motion for judgment of acquittal in the Stevens case, Judge Shintaku acted fully within his prescribed powers as described in Hawaii Rules of Penal Procedure 29(c).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> And while the State has raised serious questions about the correctness of the judge\u2019s decision, we cannot say that the State\u2019s petition on its face makes a \u201cclear and indisputable\u201d case of a flagrant and manifest abuse of discretion on Judge Shintaku\u2019s part. That being the case, this court is powerless to issue an extraordinary writ or to otherwise further review the merits of the State\u2019s petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-6\">We are mindful of our supervisory role over the courts of inferior jurisdiction \u201cto prevent and correct errors and abuses therein where no other remedy is expressly provided by law.\u201d HRS \u00a7 602-4 (1976 &amp; Supp. 1981). Such power, as is that to grant extraordinary relief generally, has been exercised by this court in rare and exigent circumstances. <em>See Gannett Pacific Corp. v. Richardson, </em>59 Haw. 224, 580 P.2d 49 (1978). For the reasons expressed above, however, we are compelled by the particular facts of this case to refrain from issuing mandamus in the exercise of that supervisory jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-7\">The petition for mandamus is hereby dismissed.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"ALt\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number><em>David C.

Schutter, </em>Attorney at Law, a Law Corporation, of counsel) for respondent Charles Stevens.</attorneys>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b322-10\"> The prosecutor sought Judge Shintaku\u2019s disqualification on May 18,. 1981, complaining of bias or prejudice on the judge\u2019s part in favor of defendant as evidenced by the judge\u2019s improper courtroom behavior. Judge Shintaku denied the motion, leading the prosecutor to petition this court for a writ of prohibition to preclude the judge\u2019s further participation in the Stevens case, which petition was also denied.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b323-6\"> Subsequent to the State\u2019s filing of its petition on October 29, 1981, this court issued an Order to Show Cause requesting the respondents to brief only the narrow issue of the court\u2019s jurisdiction to issue mandamus in light of the facts of the case and the applicable authority. Both respondents answered with memoranda on the question.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b323-7\"> The pertinent provisions of HRS \u00a7 602-5 provide as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b323-8\"><em>Jurisdiction and powers. </em>The supreme court shall have jurisdiction and powers as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b323-9\">(4) To exercise original jurisdiction in all questions arising under writs directed to courts of inferior jurisdiction and returnable before the supreme court, or if the supreme court consents to receive the case arising under writs of mandamus directed to public officers to compel them to fulfill the duties of their offices; and such other original jurisdiction as may be expressly conferred by law;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b323-11\">(6) To make or issue any order or writ necessary or appropriate in aid of its appellate or original jurisdiction, and in such case any justice may issue a writ or an order to show cause returnable before the supreme court;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b323-12\">(7) To make and award such judgments, decrees, orders and mandates, issue such executions and other processes, and do such other acts and take such other steps as may be necessary to carry into full effect the powers which are or shall be given to it by law or for the promotion of justice in matters pending before it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b323-13\"><em>See </em>Shak v.

The chapter was repealed in 1972 in a comprehensive updating and unifying of the rules of court and procedure, without abolishing the particular types of relief formerly described therein. <em>See </em>Shak v.

Ogata, <em>supra, </em>wherein we instructed that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b325-11\">[t]he Legislature is vested with power to determine whether a ruling of an inferior court shall be reviewed. If it fails to provide for such review <em>and this court, in its discretion, refuses, as we have in this case, to assume jurisdiction by granting extraordinary </em>relief... the rights of the parties involved are finally settled by the ruling of the inferior court. The result may appear harsh,.. . [b]ut this does not present an unusual situation in criminal jurisprudence, <em>State v. Johnson, </em>50 Haw. 525, 526-27, 445 P.2d 36, 38 (1968).... If the prosecution is dissatisfied with this policy, or the result in any particular case where no other remedy is available, it should address itself to the Legislature, \u201cwhose proper function it is to consider these matters and act accordingly,\u201d <em>State v. Johnson, </em>50 Haw. at 527, 445 P.2d at 38.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b325-12\">54 Haw. at 151-52, 504 P.2d at 871-72 (emphasis supplied).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b326-7\"> This is the traditional formulation of the function of mandamus \u2014 namely, to correct \u201cjurisdictional\u201d errors or to compel exercise of that jurisdiction which the court possesses. Will v. United States, <em>supra </em>at 95; Note, Supervisory and Advisory Mandamus Under All Writs Act, 86 Harv. L. Rev. 595, 598 (1973).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b326-8\"> The precise extent of this exception as articulated in Fong v. Sapienza was first brought into question in In re Application of Akana, 42 Haw. 415 (1958), which criticized theFong court for its ruling as based on a quotation taken out of context in a former case. The majority in <em>Fong, </em>faced with the question of whether mandamus would lie to compel an inferior court to exercise its discretion in a particular way, ruled that mandamus could so be issued where such discretion had been abused, based on a quotation from In re Application of Ivers, 12 Haw. 99 (1899), which ended as follows: \u201c[Mandamus] does not lie to control judicial discretion, except when that discretion has been abused.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 103, <em>quoting </em>Virginia v. Rives, 100 U.S. 313, 323 (1879). The <em>Akana </em>court, questioning this departure from the general rule of noninterference by way of mandamus where the judge has discretion, noted as had the lone dissenter in <em>Fong </em>that the quotation from <em>Virginia </em>should have been completed as follows: \u201c. .. but it is a remedy when the case is outside the exercise of this discretion, and outside of the jurisdiction of the court or officer to which of to whom the writ is addressed.\u201d Virginia v. Rives, <em>id. </em>at 323-24. It did not rule on the extent of <em>Fong\u2019s </em>applicability in light of the completed quotation, however, as it found no abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-9\">In Brown v. Hawkins, 50 Haw. 232, 437 P.2d 97 (1968), the court saw no need to accept <em>Fong </em>as controlling, finding no abuse of discretion in the case before it. It therefore adhered to the rule of Territory ex rel. Scott v. Stuart, 22 Haw. 576 (1915), that mandamus will not lie to enter a particular judgment or to set aside a decision already made. We similarly need not rule on the extent of <em>Fong's </em>applicability for the reasons set forth herein.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b327-10\"> Even in the latter instance, mandamus will be appropriate at most to direct the court to act, and not to require the court to act in a particular manner, where the task is a discretionary one. In re Lorigan, <em>supra; </em>In re Application of Liverpool, <em>supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b327-11\"> HRPP 29(c) states as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-12\"><em>Motion After Discharge of fury. </em>If the jury returns a verdict of guilty or is discharged without having returned a verdict, a motion for judgment of acquittal may be made or renewed within 10 days after the jury is discharged or within such further time as the court'may fix during the 10-day period. If a verdict of guilty is returned the court may on such motion set aside the verdict and enter judgment of acquittal. If no verdict is returned the court may enter judgment of acquittal. It shall not be necessary to the making of such a motion that a similar motion has been made prior to the submission of the case to the jury.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
