We conclude that recovery from the fund in this instance is subject to the pre-amendment limit.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-11\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-12\">The Real Estate Recovery Fund (hereafter the Fund) was established by law in 1967 \u201cto furnish financial protection to the consumer public when dealing with real estate brokers and salesmen by providing a fund which, under certain circumstances will satisfy unpaid judgments against real estate brokers and salesmen.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> It is maint\u00e1ined through fees paid by licensees of the Real Estate Commission. The maximum liability of the Fund for claims against any one licensee was set in 1967 at $20,000.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In 1977 the maximum <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>was increased to $40,000,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the amendment\u2019s effective date being June 9, 1977.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-6\">In 1973, plaintiffs-appellees M. C. Clark, Mitsuko Iris Clark, Barbara M. Hoapili, Richard A. Maldonado, Stephanie U. Lee, Joseph M. O\u2019Neill, Joseph M. O\u2019Neill, Jr., for themselves and all others similarly situated (hereafter Appellees), as purchasers of individual one per cent interests in real property sold by Defendants International Syndications, Inc., Jack Mahakian, Sol Laikind, and Jack Leuschel (hereafter Defendants), filed a class action against them, alleging false and misleading representations.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-7\">On September 13,1974, the plaintiff class was awarded $514,000 in damages. Butnoclaim against the Fund was made until December 29, 1977 when appellees filed a Motion for Order Directing Payment of Unpaid Judgment from Real Estate Recovery Fund seeking to obtain a portion of the unpaid judgment in the amount of $60,000, as three of the defendants were licensees of the Board when the causes of action arose. Defendant-intervenor-appellant Real Estate Commission (hereafter the Commission), the Fund\u2019s custodian, advised the court that only $2,000 could be paid from the Fund on behalf of Defendants Sol Laikind and Jack Leuschel; it further informed the court the.statutory limit of $20,000 had already been expended on behalf of Internationa] Syndications, Inc. by the Commission.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b90-8\">The Commission asserted appellees\u2019 recovery should be subject to the statutory limitation of $20,000 per licensee that was in effect when the causes of action against defendants accrued. It claimed the Fund\u2019s liability should be held to the unexpended balances of the $20,000 payable on behalf of each of the three licensees. However, the circuit court in granting the appellees\u2019 motion applied the new <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>limitation of $40,000 per licensee. The Commission\u2019s appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-6\">It is an established rule that \u201c[n]o law has any retrospective operation, unless otherwise expressed or obviously intended.\u201d HRS \u00a7 1-3; <em>Graham Construction Supply, Inc. v. Schrader Construction, Inc., </em>63 Haw. 540, 546, 632 P.2d 649, 653 (1981); <em>Molokai Homesteaders Cooperative Association v. Cobb, </em>63 Haw. 453, 469, 629 P.2d 1134, 1145 (1981). The rule is particularly applicable where the statute or amendment involves substantive rights.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Substantive rights are generally defined as rights \u201cwhich \u2018take away or impair vested rights acquired under existing laws, or create a new obligation, impose a new duty, or attach a new disability in respect to transactions or considerations already past,\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> as distinguished from remedies or procedural laws which merely prescribe methods of enforcing or giving effect to existing rights.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Hence, a subsequent amendment involving substantive rights will not be read as operating retrospectively in the absence of a clear legislative expression that such operation is intended. In the instant case, we conclude the increase in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>Fund\u2019s maximum liability was a substantive amendment and not a mere remedial or procedural change.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-6\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-7\">The measure of financial protection provided against defaulting real estate brokers and salesmen by the Fund was a substantial statutory right of the appellees. HRS \u00a7\u00a7 467-18 and 467-24 operated to establish a right in the appellees to assert claims against the Fund before the 1977 amendment became effective. When the judgment against defendants was obtained, claimants had a right to recover up to $20,000 per licensee from the Fund. And when the Legislature subsequently increased the m\u00e1ximum liability of the Fund to $40,000 per licensee, it created, for all practical purposes, a right to recover another $20,000 per licensee. The increase was not a mere change in procedure or remedy to enforce an existing right. Since the amendment created an additional substantive right, it cannot be applied retrospectively to transactions already past, unless clear legislative intent compels a contrary construction.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-8\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-9\">We must therefore ascertain whether there is an expression or obvious intendment that the amendment was to have \u201cany retrospective operation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b92-10\">First, in \u00e9xamining the language of Act 197, S.L.H. 1977, we see nothing expressing an intent that the Fund\u2019s new maximum liability was to apply to pending claims. In fact, Section 4 provides the \u201cAct shall take effect upon its approval,\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and this court has said-that \u201c[wjhere, by its terms, a statute is ... to take effect at a fixed future date ... it is prospective only in operation.\u201d <em>Waiakea Mill Co. v. Vierra, </em>55 Haw. 550, 555 (1940). Thus, a retrospective application of this amendment would be contrary to the relevant legislative expression and prior judicial pronouncement.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-11\">Appellees further argue legislative history consisting of an early draft of a related bill demonstrates the Legislature intended a retro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>spective application of the amendment.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> But as the enacted version of the amendatory legislation contained no expression that the amendment should apply to pending claims, we are unable to so conclude. Moreover, this contention is contrary to the statutory presumption that an act is to have prospective application unless a contrary intent is manifested by the Legislature. We would not ascribe a lack of awareness of the foregoing statute, HRS \u00a7 1-3, and relevant judicial declarations to the Legislature.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"A-L\"><em>Sidney K. Ayabe (Libkuman, Ventura, Moon id Ayabe, </em>of counsel) for defendant-intervenor-appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"A62\"><em>Allan Yee (Ian L. Mattock </em>on the brief; <em>Mattock id Kleintop, </em>of counsel) for plaintiffs-appellees.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b93-5\">Here, there are no words or expression that the amendatory legislation should operate retrospectively. In light of this silence, the amendment increasing the limits of recovery from the Fund cannot be applied to a claim or right of action that arose prior to its effective date.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-6\">The order of the circuit court allowing appellees\u2019 motion for an order of payment of unpaid judgment from the Fund is reversed, and the case is remanded for the entry of an order consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b89-14\"> HRS \u00a7 467-24 states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b89-15\"><em>Maximum liability. </em>Notwithstanding any other provision, the liability of the real estate recovery fund shall not exceed $40,000 for any one licensee.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b89-16\"> S.L.H. 1967, c. 187, subsequently codified as part of Chapter 467.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b89-17\">\n<em> Id.</em>\n</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b90-9\"> S.L.H. 1977, c. 197.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b90-10\"> In a Memorandum in Response to Motion for Order Directing Payment of Unpaid Judgment from Real Estate Recovery Fund filed on January 17, 1978, the Commission indicated three previous orders that required payment from the Fund on behalf of these licensees had been made. Reference was made to Civil Nos. 40475, 40461, and 40405.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-11\">It should be further noted that the payment from the Fund applies only to Defendants Sol Laikind, Jack Leuschel, and International Syndications, Inc. since they were duly licensed brokers or salespersons at the time the action arose. Their licenses were revoked prior to the order directing payment from the Board.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b91-7\"> It is a general rule in most jurisdictions that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b91-8\">Statutes or regulations which say nothing about retroactive application are not applied retroactively if such a construction will impair existing rights, create new obligations or impose additional duties with respect to past transactions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AZ0\">Derenco, Inc. v.
