The petitioner initially argues that the trial judge erred in finding the proof evident and presumption great that petitioner committed the crimes for which he was charged, and additionally seeks our examination of the statute in light of the constitutional guarantees of equal protection of the laws, due process of law and bail. We find it unnecessary to review the trial judge\u2019s findings or to assess the statute\u2019s validity against the fourteenth amendment\u2019s equal protection clause, however, for we conclude that HRS \u00a7 804-3(b)(3) violates the bail provisions of the Hawaii Constitution and the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-6\">Petitioner Henry James Huihui was indicted on November 19, 1981 for two counts of extortion in the first degree, a class B felony under HRS \u00a7 707-765(1 )(a) (Supp. 1981) and two counts of extortion in the second degree, a class C felony under HRS \u00a7 707-764(l)(a) (Supp. 1981). Following a hearing on the government\u2019s motion to commit petitioner without bail, the first circuit court denied petitioner bail under HRS \u00a7 804-3(b)(3) because it found that (a) the extortion charges were \u201cserious offenses\u201d within the meaning of HRS \u00a7 804-3(b); (b) the proof was evident and the presumption great that petitioner committed the offenses; and (c) at the time of the indictment, petitioner was already free on $100,000 bail awaiting trial on various felony charges for which he was indicted on July 2, 1980. While incarcerated, petitioner sought the intervention of this court for a writ of habeas corpus directing the circuit court judge to hold a bail hearing and determine a reasonable amount of bail for petitioner to post as a condition for his pretrial release. We granted an expedited hearing because of the importance of the petitioner\u2019s liberty interest, and in a recent decision issued the requested writ.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-8\">Petitioner advances the threshold proposition that article I, section 12 of the Hawaii Constitution guarantees persons accused of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>crimes the right to pretrial release subject to reasonable bail.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Acknowledging at the same time that this right may be curtailed for legitimate reasons, petitioner avers that the provision for the denial of bail in HRS \u00a7 804-3(b)(3) impermissibly infringed on his right to bail by conclusively presuming that persons charged with a serious crime while on bail on a felony charge pose a danger to the community or are not likely to appear at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-7\">An initial inquiry into whether our state constitution guarantees accused persons a right to bail is necessitated by the particular wording of article I, section 12, which, like its federal counterpart,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> fails to mention any such right. That provision of Hawaii\u2019s Bill of Rights recites as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b544-8\">Excessive bail shall not be required, nor excessive fines imposed, nor cruel nor unusual punishment inflicted. The court may dispense with bail if reasonably satisfied that the defendant or witness will appear when directed, except for a defendant charged with an offense punishable by life imprisonment. When originally adopted in 1959,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the provision (then num-</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AlI\">bered article I, section 9) consisted only of the first sentence, which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>closely follows the wording of the eighth amendment. The Committee of the Whole Report on the proposed Bill of Rights in fact indicated that the sentence was \u201ctaken from the 8th Amendment to the Federal Constitution, and will give this state the benefit of Federal decisions construing the same.\u201d Comm. Whole Rep. No. 5,1 Proceedings of the Constitutional Convention of Hawaii of 1950, at 302 (1950). No other explanation of the excessive bail clause appears in the 1950 Constitutional Convention proceedings, and the provision was incorporated into Hawaii\u2019s Bill of Rights with virtually no debate.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-5\">We have acknowledged in the past \u201cthat the fundamental principle in construing a constitutional provision is to give effect to the intention of the framers and the people adopting it.\u201d <em>State v. Miyasaki, </em>62 Haw. 269, 281, 614 P.2d 915, 922 (1980), <em>quoting HGEA v. County of Maui, </em>59 Haw. 65, 80-81, 576 P.2d 1029, 1039 (1978). Here, where the 1950 Constitutional Convention delegates failed to provide specific guidance for interpreting article I, section 12, we shall, as they intended, refer to federal decisions construing the like language of the eighth amendment. Should we so decide, however, we shall not hesitate to \u201cextend the protections of the Hawaii Bill of Rights beyond those of textually parallel provisions of the Federal Bill of Rights when logic and a sound regard for the purposes of those protections\u201d so warrant. <em>State v. Miyasaki, supra </em>at 281, 614 P.2d at 922; <em>State v. Manzo, </em>58 Haw. 440, 452, 573 P.2d 945, 953 (1977); <em>State v. Kaluna, </em>55 Haw. 361, 369, 520 P.2d 51, 58 (1974). For it is our obligation to interpret and enforce the state constitution as the highest court of this sovereign state \u201cnot in total disregard of federal interpretations of identical language, but with reference to the wisdom of adopting these interpretations for our state.\u201d <em>State v. Miyasaki, supra </em>at 280, 614 P.2d at 922; <em>State v. Manzo, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b545-6\">The United States Supreme Court has never squarely confronted the question of whether a right to bail inheres in the eighth amendment,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and dicta from two of its most recent cases construing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>the excessive bail clause have been viewed as supporting conflicting interpretations. <em>See United States v. Edwards, </em>430 A.2d 1321, 1329-30 (D.C. App. <em>1981), cert. denied, </em>50 U.S.L.W. 3765; Borman, <em>The Selling of Preventive Detention </em>1970, 65 Nw. L. Rev. 879, 901-03 (1971). In <em>Carlson v. Landon, </em>342 U.S. 524 (1952),<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> the Supreme Court rejected the contention that the eighth amendment required the same reasonable bail for alien Communists under .deportation charges as it did for citizens charged with bailable offenses. In support of its holding, the majority noted that the bail clause, like its predecessor in the English Bill of Rights, \u201chas never been thought to accord a right to bail in all cases, but merely to provide that bail shall not be excessive in those cases where it is proper to grant bail.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 545. Observing that Congress has always been free to define bailable offenses despite the eighth amendment, the Court concluded that the excessive bail clause did not require bail to be set under the circumstances of the case. In <em>Stack v. Boyle, </em>342 U.S. 1 (1951),<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>on the other hand, the Supreme Court, in reviewing the reasonableness of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>certain bail orders, spoke of pretrial release in terms of a \u201ctraditional right to freedom before conviction [which] permits the unhampered preparation of a defense, and serves to prevent the infliction of punishment prior to conviction. Unless this right to bail before trial is preserved, the presumption of innocence, secured only after centuries of struggle, would lose its meaning.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 4 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b547-5\">The apparent conflict in tenor between these opinions is mirrored in a schism among the lower federal courts over the interpretation of the federal excessive bail clause. The federal courts generally stand in agreement that the eighth amendment does not guarantee an absolute right to bail. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Abrahams, </em>575 F.2d 3 (1st Cir. 1978), <em>cert. denied, </em>439 U.S. 821 (1978); <em>United States v. Smith, </em>444 F.2d 61 (8th Cir. 1971), <em>cert. denied, </em>405 U.S. 977 (1971); <em>Mastrian v. Hedman, </em>326 F.2d 708 (8th Cir. 1964). <em>But see Trimble v. Stone, </em>187 F. Supp. 483, 485 (D.C. Cir. 1960); Foote, <em>The Coming Constitutional Crisis in Bail </em>(pts. 1 &amp; 2), 113 U. Pa. L. Rev. 959, 1125 (1965). Whether the eighth amendment insures any rights in the bail context beyond that to protection from excessive bail, however, has moved these courts to take essentially two divergent positions.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b547-6\">The weight of the federal case authority appears to support the historical interpretation of the eighth amendment suggested by the Supreme Court in <em>Carlson v. Landon, supra, </em>in denying the existence of a general constitutional \u201cright to bail.\u201d Duker, <em>The Right to Bail: A Historical Inquiry, </em>42 Alb. L. Rev. 33, 89 (1977); see e.g., <em>United States v. Edwards, supra; United States v. Smith, supra; Koen v. Long, </em>302 F. Supp. 1383 (E.D. Mo. 1969), cert. <em>denied, </em>401 U.S. 923 (1971). One of the most recent proponents of this position, <em>United States v. Edwards, supra, </em>details the analytical framework for reaching the conclusion that history prevents the eighth amendment from being read as anything more than a check against the judiciary\u2019s setting of excessive bail where bail is allowed.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>In <em>Edwards, </em>defendant, charged first with armed rape and later with burglary, robbery and sodomy, was denied bail pursuant to D.C. Code \u00a7 23-1322 (1973) which allowed detention of arrestees charged with certain offenses for up to sixty days pending trial. On appeal, defendant alleged, <em>inter alia, </em>that the pretrial detention statute on its face violated his constitutional right to bail as implied in the eighth amendment. Following an exhaustive discussion of the excessive bail clause\u2019s history, the District of Columbia Court of Appeals denied defendant\u2019s claim, concluding that (a) the clause originated in the English Bill of Rights as a restriction on local justices who imposed excessive bail on prisoners charged with bailable offenses in avoidance of the Habeas Corpus Act of 1679;<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> (b) therefore, the clause, as a remedy against judicial abuse and not primarily a means of protecting individual liberty, did not imply a right to bail; (c) Congress, in adopting the Bill of Rights in 1789, incorporated the same \u201cexcessive bail\u201d language without inserting an explicit guarantee of bail although it was free to do so; (d) several colonies, new states and Congress itself recognized the limits of the excessive bail clause by enacting laws specifically providing for bail as a matter of right; and (e) therefore, the eighth amendment must be interpreted as simply prohibiting excessive bail where bail is allowed by statute or constitution and not as providing the right to bail in every instance. <em>See generally </em>Duker, <em>supra; </em>Foote, <em>supra </em>(pt. 1); Meyer, <em>Constitutionality of Pretrial Detention </em>(pt. 1), 60 Geo. L. J. 1139 (1972); <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number><em>see also Ex Parte Watkins, </em>32 U.S. (7 Pet.) 568 (1833). Finally, the court rejected the distinction defendant attempted to draw between the English theory of civil liberties, in which Parliament is the ultimate source of rights, and the American form of government, in which the constitution reigns supreme, in arguing against interpreting the eighth amendment as an intended limitation on the judiciary. It reiterated in response that the framers of the Bill of Rights did not declare the right to bail a fundamental one deserving of protection against congressional encroachment.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-5\">Some of the same conclusions were reached in <em>Parker v. Roth, </em>202 Neb. 850, 278 N.W.2d 106 <em>(1979), cert. denied, </em>444 U.S. 920 (1979), a Nebraska Supreme Court case in which defendant challenged the constitutionality of a 1978 Nebraska constitutional provision reciting that \u201c[a]ll persons shall be bailable by sufficient sureties except for treason, sexual offenses involving penetration by force or against the will of the victim, and murder, where the proof is evident or the presumption great.\u201d In rejecting defendant\u2019s assertion of a constitutional right to bail under the eighth amendment which had been violated by the Nebraska provision, the court recounted the history of the excessive bail clause in the English Bill of Rights and concluded that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b549-6\">[t]he framers of the Constitution were well aware of the problems of bail in England, and could quite easily have provided that bail should be permitted for all offenses had they so intended. They were not, however, attempting to provide a new right in the new country, but instead were transferring an accepted, recognized principle that if an offense was bailable, the individual\u2019s right to freedom could not be defeated by requiring bail in excessive amounts.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b549-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 111. The court also noted that capital offenses have traditionally been excepted from state provisions allowing bail as a matter of right, while nothing in the language or history of the eighth amendment would exclude these offenses from any purported constitutional right to bail.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> \u201cOnce a recognition that legislative bodies <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>had the right to exclude murder, treason, or capital offenses from bail is made, one is left with the inescapable conclusion that the Eighth Amendment simply prohibited excessive bail <em>where </em>allowed and did not guarantee the right to bail in every instance.\u201d <em>Id. See also In re Bowler, </em>9 Haw. 171. (1893). While it conceded that the denial of bail altogether may constitute a violation of \u201csome other provision of either the federal constitution or [the Nebraska] Constitution,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 110, the court maintained that the \u201cEighth Amendment to the federal constitution does not stand for the proposition that one has a constitutional right to bail.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b550-6\"><em>A </em>growing number of federal circuit and district courts, on the other hand, reject the proposition arising out of the <em>Edwards </em>and <em>Parker </em>analyses that the eighth amendment\u2019s operation depends entirely upon an antecedent legislative act creating a right to bail. <em>See, e.g., Finetti v. Harris, </em>609 F.2d 594 (2d Cir. 1979); <em>United States ex rel. Goodman v. Kehl, </em>456 F.2d 863 (2d Cir. 1972) (in dicta); <em>United States v. Motlow, </em>10 F.2d 657 (7th Cir. 1926); <em>United States ex rel. Covington v. Coparo, supra; United States ex rel. Fink v. Heyd, </em>287 F. Supp. 716 (E.D. La. 1968), <em>aff'd, </em>408 F.2d 7 (5th Cir. 1969), <em>cert. denied, </em>396 U.S. 895 (1969); <em>Wansley v. Wilkerson, </em>263 F. Supp. 54 (W.D. Va. 1967); <em>accord, Martin v. State, </em>517 P.2d 1389 (Alas. 1974). The Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals\u2019 decision in <em>Hunt v. Roth, supra, </em>although recently vacated as moot in <em>Murphy v. Hunt, </em>50 U.S.L.W. 4264, provides the most recent and comprehensive analysis of the position that the eighth amendment must be interpreted as guaranteeing more than merely protection against excessive bail.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-7\">The defendant in <em>Hunt </em>was charged with several sexual assault and forcible sexual assault offenses. The state district court refused to set bail, relying on the same Nebraska constitutional provision sustained in <em>Parker v. Roth, supra. </em>Notwithstanding principles of comity, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>the court of appeals declared the Nebraska provision violative of the eighth amendment, rejecting the state\u2019s reading of the excessive bail clause as allowing it to refuse bail without running afoul of the constitution. Relying on <em>United States ex rel. Goodman v. Kehl, supra, </em>the court held that logic was sufficient to warrant reading the excessive bail clause so as to prohibit the denial of bail in the absence of legitimate reasons, as well as excessive bail which, in constitutional terms and in practice, amount to the same thing. Recognizing on one hand that in certain cases no amount of bail may be sufficient to protect society\u2019s primary interest in obtaining assurance that the accused will appear for trial, the court believed, on the other hand, that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b551-5\">it is quite another thing to say that the eighth amendment would permit outright denial of bail without consideration of the factors relevant to an individual\u2019s suitability for pretrial release; at least in the eyes of the accused, an unreasonable and arbitrary <em>denial </em>of bail is surely the equivalent to an unobtainably high amount of bail that is set unreasonably and arbitrarily.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b551-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 1158. In answer to the historical interpretation of the bail clause proferred by the state, the court noted that an analysis of the English common law and its adaptation in the colonies does not necessarily support a literal reading of the eighth amendment since (a) Congress operates under the limits of the constitution, which \u201cwas our assurance that many abuses suffered under English rule would not be passed on to our people,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 1159; (b) the colonial laws reveal that the American concept of bail differed significantly from the English in that bail was considered a right of all accuseds except those charged with capital offenses; and (c) the traditional exception for capital crimes from statutory bail requirements does not support a legislative power to deny bail in noncapital cases as there are historical as well as logical bases for the capital crimes exception.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <em>See also Carlson v. London, supra </em>at 556-57 (Black, J., dissenting). <em>The Hunt </em>court found the Nebraska bail provision violative of the eighth amendment for its conclusive presumption that those charged with the enumerated offenses were likely to pose a danger to the community or not appear at trial if released on bail, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>without allowing the judge to make these determinations on an individual basis with relevant information and with no empirical evidence supporting such presumptions in noncapital cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-6\">We acknowledge the vital role that history must play in determining the intent of the framers of the eighth amendment, especially since its incorporation into the federal Bill of Rights occurred with little discussion or debate to guide us, two centuries later, in ascertaining its full import. Tribe, <em>An Ounce of Detention: Preventive Justice in the World of John Mitchell, </em>56 Va. L. Rev. 371,398 (1970). But here, where the interpretation most strongly supported by history conflicts with \u201clogic and a sound regard for the purposes\u201d of the excessive bail clause, <em>State v. Miyasaki, supra, </em>we find it incumbent upon us to follow the latter course and adopt the reasoning of <em>Hunt </em>in interpreting our state bail provision. To read article I, section 12 as forbididing the judiciary to impose <em>excessive </em>bail while allowing the legislature to do away with bail altogether would indeed give the bail clause a \u201cweird, devitalizing interpretation\u201d which reduces it \u201cbelow the level of a pious admonition,\u201d <em>Carlson v. Landon, supra </em>at 556 (Black, J., dissenting), for the provision would \u201cdo no more than protect a right to bail which [the legislature] can grant and which [the legislature] can take away.\u201d <em>Id. </em>As observed by Justice Mack in her dissenting opinion in <em>United States v. Edwards, supra, </em>with respect to the federal bail clause,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b552-7\">[t]his is a classic example of the cart pulling the horse since the Congress could abrogate the right to bail altogether, making the Eighth Amendment altogether meaningless. Surely the framers of our Bill of Rights did not intend to fashion illusory protection \u2014 leaving open the possibility that a subsequent act of a legislature could empty a <em>critical </em>provision of the federal constitution of all content.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b552-8\">430 A.2d at 1365.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-9\">Moreover, like the courts in <em>Hunt v. Roth, supra, </em>and <em>United States ex rel. Goodman v. Kehl, supra, </em>\u201cwe perceive no constitutional distinction between requiring excessive bail and denying bail altogether in the absence of legitimate reasons.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 868. Consistent with the characterization of bail as reflecting a balancing of the accused\u2019s interest in pretrial freedom with society\u2019s interests, <em>inter alia, </em>in obtaining his presence at trial, <em>see Hunt v. Roth, supra </em>at 1157, Duker, <em>supra </em>at 101, the Supreme Court has required that the fixing of bail <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>be based on standards relevant to those interests in the particular circumstances of the case and the accused\u2019s suitability for pretrial release. <em>Stack v. Boyle, supra </em>at 5; <em>accord, Hunt v. Roth, supra. </em>An amount which is set higher than necessary to fulfill these interests is unreasonable and \u201cexcessive\u201d within the meaning of the eighth amendment. <em>Stack v. Boyle, supra. </em>It therefore defies logic to interpret that constitutional provision as prohibiting bail set so unreasonably high as to be unobtainable and not reflective of legitimate state concerns on one hand, while on the other as permitting the outright denial of bail absent reasonable grounds, since both actions, under like circumstances, amount to the same thing. Accordingly, we hold that article I, section 12 of the Hawaii Constitution, prohibiting excessive bail, also protects persons accused of crimes from the unreasonable or arbitrary denial of bail.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-5\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-6\">We now turn to the question of whether HRS \u00a7 804-3(b)(3) unreasonably denies bail in violation of article I, section 12 of the state constitution. HRS \u00a7 804-3 (Supp. 1981), in its entirety, provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b553-7\"><em>Bailable offenses, </em>(a) For purposes of this section, \u201cserious crime\u201d means a class A or B felony, except forgery in the first degree and failing to render aid under section 291C-12, and \u201cbail\u201d includes release on one\u2019s own recognizance.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b553-8\">(b) <em>Any person charged with a criminal offense shall be bailable by sufficient sureties; provided that no bail shall be allowed where the charge is for a serious crime where the proof is evident and the presumption great, and</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b553-9\">(1) The offense is punishable by imprisonment for life not subject to parole; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b553-10\">(2) The defendant has been previously convicted of a serious crime within the ten-year period immediately preceding the date of the charge against him; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b553-11\">(3) <em>The defendant is already on bail on a felony charge; </em>or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b553-12\">(4) The defendant is on parole.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b553-13\">(c) If a defendant has been admitted to bail on any charge, the prosecutor may move at any time for revocation of bail on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>grounds set out in subsection (b) above, and bail shall be revoked upon proof thereof.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b554-7\">(emphasis added). Prior to 1980, HRS \u00a7 804-3 recited simply that \u201c[a]ll persons charged with criminal offenses shall be bailable by sufficient sureties, unless for offenses punishable by imprisonment for life not subject to parole, when the proof is evident or the presumption great.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The statute was augmented in 1980 to limit the availability of bail on the legislature\u2019s belief that some restrictions were necessary in dealing \u201cmore harshly with persistent offenders who have abused the bail privilege in the past and present a clear danger to society.\u201d Senate Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 756, <em>reprinted in </em>Senate Journal 1366, 1366 (1980). Subsections (b)(2) and (3) were aimed specifically at repeat offenders. Senate Conf. Comm. Rep. No. 85, <em>reprinted in </em>Senate Journal 1004, 1005 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b554-8\">Petitioner\u2019s argument against the statute\u2019s validity is tworfold. First, he claims that prevention of future crimes is not a legitimate concern for a court to consider when fixing bail, and therefore that HRS \u00a7 804-3(b)(3), requiring the denial of bail on a presumption of an accused\u2019s guilt and dangerousness, violates the accused\u2019s due process and bail rights. Second, petitioner complains that even assuming the propriety of preventive detention, HRS \u00a7 804-3(b)(3) is impermissibly grounded upon an irrebuttable presumption that every person charged with a serious crime while on bail on a felony charge poses a danger to the community, again in derogation of the accused\u2019s right to due process and bail.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-9\">The question of the constitutionality of pretrial preventive detention in both right to bail and due process contexts has long plagued courts and commentators. In the bail setting, those courts which have sanctioned preventive detention have generally found the threat of danger to the community to be a legitimate, rational concern which a judge may take into account when setting or denying bail. <em>See, e.g., United States ex rel. Covington v. Coparo, supra </em>at 207; <em>Wansley v. Wilkerson, supra </em>at 57; <em>Rendel v. Mummert, </em>106 Ariz. 233, 474 P.2d 824, 828-29 (1970). Others have found an inherent power <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>in the court to deny bail in order to protect against interference in the criminal process as where an accused has threatened witnesses. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Bigelow, </em>544 F.2d 904, 907-08 (6th Cir. 1976); <em>Mastrian v. Hedman, supra </em>at 712; <em>Nail v. Slayton, </em>353 F. Supp. 1013, 1019 (W.D. Va. 1972). Opponents, however, claim that the denial of bail to protect the community is inconsistent with state constitutional or statutory provisions granting a right to bail in noncapital cases, in that the sole purpose of bail traditionally recognized is the securing of the defendant\u2019s assurance that he will appear at trial. <em>See Stack v. Boyle, supra </em>at 5; <em>Ex Parte Milburn, </em>34 U.S. (9 Pet.) 704, 710 (1835). <em>See generally </em>Duker, <em>supra </em>at 67-70. As there is no evidence in history that bail was ever intended as a deterrent against the commission of crimes between indictment and trial, Tribe, <em>supra </em>at 400-01, and in view of the difficulty in accurately estimating one\u2019s dangerous propensities, these courts generally maintain that bail may not constitutionally be denied solely on an estimated likelihood of danger to the community or interference with the judicial process. <em>See e.g., Martin v. State, supra; In re Underwood, </em>9 Cal.3d 345, 107 Cal. Rptr. 401, 508 P.2d 721 (1973); <em>State v. Pray, </em>133 Vt. 537, 346 A.2d 227 (1975). <em>See generally </em>Tribe, supra; Note, <em>Preventive Detention Before Trial, </em>79 Harv. L. Rev. 1489 (1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b555-5\">The more controversial aspect of the idea that an accused may be incarcerated prior to an adjudication of guilt on an assumption of his dangerousness, however, is its apparent conflict with the notion basic to our criminal jurisprudence and purportedly lodged in the fourteenth amendment that every accused is presumed innocent until proven guilty. <em>See generally </em>Note, <em>supra. </em>Those who object to preventive detention on due process grounds point out that our penal system punishes for the commission of past crimes, not for the presumed likelihood of future offenses based merely on the fact that an individual has been accused. <em>See Commonwealth v. Truesdale, </em>449 Pa. 325, 296 A.2d 829 (1972); Hickey, <em>Preventive Detention and the Crime of Being Dangerous, </em>58 Geo. L. J. 287 (1969). As stated by Circuit Justice Douglas in <em>Carbo v. United States, </em>82 S. Ct. 662 (1962), the \u201c[d]enial of bail should not be used as an indirect way of making a man shoulder a sentence for unproved crimes.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 667. The argument in response, however, is that the presumption of innocence, a doctrine allocating the burden of proof in criminal trials, has no application in pretrial stages to prevent the imposition of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>restraints on individuals accused of crimes. <em>Rendel v. Mummert, supra; Blunt v. United States, </em>322 A.2d 579 (D.C. App. 1974); <em>see Bell v. Wolfish, </em>441 U.S. 520, 533 (1979). Preventive detention, moreover, although a purposeful incapacitation of the detainee, does not amount to \u201cpunishment\u201d as defined by the Supreme Court, <em>see Bell v. Wolfish, id. </em>at 537-39, as its function is regulatory, related to a legitimate governmental objective, and not intended to promote the traditional aims of punishment \u2014 retribution and deterrence. <em>See United States v. Edwards, supra </em>at 1332-33; <em>see also Rendel v. Mummert, supra </em>at 828-29.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-6\">Despite these conflicting considerations, we believe that this state has a legitimate interest in protecting its communities from those who threaten their welfare, and that this interest may be taken into account in the setting of pretrial bail. But the manner in which the legislature allows this and other legitimate, recognized state concerns to be reflected in the bail decision, should it choose to do so by statute, must also be reasonable and satisfy the minimal demands of procedural due process as necessitated by the fact that pretrial detention denies an accused his liberty without a formal adjudication of guilt. <em>United States v. Edwards, supra </em>at 1334; <em>Atkins v. People, </em>644 F.2d 543 (6th Cir. 1981), <em>cert. denied, </em>101 S. Ct. 3115 (1981). <em>Cf. Morrissey v. Brewer, </em>408 U.S. 471, 482-83 (1972) (due process requirements apply to parole revocation). In <em>Escander v. Ferguson, </em>441 F. Supp. 53 (S.D. Fla. 1977), for example, a Florida constitutional bail provision was construed as improperly prohibiting bail in cases involving felonies punishable by life imprisonment where the proof was evident and the presumption great that the accused had committed the crime. The provision in effect created an irrebuttable presumption that the accused would not appear at trial solely from the nature and proof of the charge, as the accused was not afforded the opportunity to establish, notwithstanding proof of the charge, that he was a good bail risk. As the presumption that he would not appear at trial was not \u201cnecessarily or universally true in fact,\u201d and because the state had a \u201creasonable alternative means of making the crucial determination\u201d of the likelihood of defendant\u2019s appearance through a fair hearing, <em>id. </em>at 59-60 (quoting <em>Vlandis v. Kline, </em>412 U.S. 441, at 446 (1973)), the court held that the provision swept too broadly in violation of the fourteenth amendment\u2019s due process clause. This holding is consonant with the conclusion of the District <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>of Columbia Court of Appeals in <em>United States v. Edwards, supra, </em>that pretrial detention, by implicating a liberty interest, requires a fair hearing \u201cwithin the mandates of procedural due process.\u201d 430 A.2d at 1334. <em>Cf. Hunt v. Roth, supra </em>at 1664-65 (provision denying bail to class of individuals based on irrebuttable presumptions of dangerousness or likelihood of flight violates eighth amendment).</p>\n<p id=\"b557-5\">In the present case, HRS \u00a7 804-3(b)(3) similarly exceeds the bounds of reasonableness and due process by conclusively presuming a defendant\u2019s dangerousness from the fact that he had been charged previously with a serious crime and presently with a felony, and by leaving no discretion in the trial judge to allow bail based on other factors which may be directly relevant to a determination of the likelihood of the defendant\u2019s committing other crimes while free pending trial.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The statute simply reflects a legislative determination that an entire class of accused persons is not entitled to bail by reason of their presumed dangerousness, without affording these persons a fair opportunity to rebut such presumption. Judges acting pursuant thereto, denied discretion to consider other circumstances, are thus required to arbitrarily deny these individuals bail solely on the nature and proof of the crimes charged. Indeed, the record in this case indicates that the trial judge considered the statutory language mandatory and did not take into account any facts or circumstances other than those relevant to the petitioner\u2019s participation in the crimes for which he was charged before denying bail.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-6\">Additionally, we observe that the statute, by forbidding the granting of, much less dispensing with bail in the enumerated circumstances, should either be deemed appropriate by the trial judge, runs afoul of the second sentence of article I, section 12 of the Hawaii Constitution which recites that \u201c[t]he court may dispense. with bail if reasonably satisfied that the defendant or witness will appear when directed, except for a defendant charged with an offense punishable by life imprisonment.\u201d This provision, unique to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>Hawaii, was added in 1968 with the intent to \u201cclarif(y) the scope with respect to the requirement of bail and. . . remove doubt, if any, as to the discretionary powers of the court in the matter of bail.\u201d II Proceedings of the Constitutional Convention of Hawaii of 1968, at 13 (1968) (remarks oft) ele gate Young); <em>accord, </em>Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 55,1 Proceedings of the Constitutional Convention of Hawaii of 1968, at 234 (1968). The Committee on Bill of Rights, Suffrage and Elections emphasized that this second sentence merely reflected the bail procedure then being followed by courts under statutes \u201cimplementing the existing section 9\u201d (presently section 12), which provided for bail as a matter of right in noncapital cases with discretion in the trial judge in setting the amount to be required. <em>See </em>HRS ch. 709 (1968) (renumbered HRS ch. 804 (1976 &amp; Supp. 1981)). While the added language does not prohibit the court from denying bail to a particular defendant, it clearly contemplates the existence of discretion in the trial judge to release the defendant with or without the requirement of bail, which discretion is abolished by the 1980 statute.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"Aro\"><em>Brook Hart, Peter C. Wolff, Jr., Michael D. Wilson, (Hart and Wolff, </em>Attorneys at Law, a Law Corporation), for petitioner.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"Atu\"><em>James H. Dannenberg, </em>Deputy Attorney General, and <em>Arthur E. Ross, Peter B. Carlisle, </em>Deputy Prosecuting Attorneys, for respondents.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b558-6\">We therefore hold that HRS \u00a7 804-3(b)(3), by the unreasonable manner in which it provides for the denial of bail, violates both provisions of article I, section 12 of the Hawaii Constitution and the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment to the United States Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-7\">Our previous decision granting petitioner\u2019s writ for habeas corpus is incorporated herein by reference.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b544-9\"> Petitioner raises an identical claim with respect to the eighth amendment to the United States Constitution, arguing initially that the excessive bail clause applies to the states through the fourteenth amendment\u2019s due process clause. While the Supreme Court has never so ruled, several federal and state courts have either assumed that it applies or have specifically ruled that it does. <em>See, e.g., </em>Hunt v. Roth, 648 F.2d 1148 (8th Cir. 1981); <em>vacated as moot sub nom. </em>Murphy v. Hunt, 50 U.S.L.W. 4264 (1982); Pilkerton v. Circuit Court, 324 F.2d 45 (8th Cir. 1963); United States ex rel.

Enactment of the Statute of Westminster, restricting local sheriffs\u2019 powers by enumerating bailable offenses for the first time, was followed by several centuries of abuse due to difficulties of enforcement, reserved power in the higher justices and Crown, and defective attempts at reform. The Habeas Corpus Act itself came fifty years after the Petition of Right of 1628, which prohibited the detention of any prisoner without a specific return identifying the causes for his incarceration that would facilitate a determination of the propriety of the detention. Courts were nonetheless able to unduly detain prisoners and frustrate the goals of the Petition of Right by taking long periods of time to make returns of habeas corpus. The Habeas Corpus Act, while closing this loophole by establishing a means of enforceing bail and habeas corpus rights, opened another by recognizing discretion in thejudges in the setting of bail, inevitably leading to abuse in the form of their setting prohibitively high bail. This problem was addressed by clause 10 of the Bill of Rights of 1689, the excessive bail clause. <em>See generally </em>Duker, <em>supra, </em>42 Alb. L.
