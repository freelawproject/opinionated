First, whether the trial court erred in not dismissing the instant indictment for lack of independent grand jury counsel. Second, whether a proper chain of custody was established regarding two bullets removed from the body of Charles Yee Hoy. Finding no reversible error, we affirm appellant\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>Before considering appellant\u2019s first claim, the record reveals that a pretrial motion seeking to have the instant indictment dismissed was not filed in the circuit court. Thus, the issue which appellant asks us to consider was not raised below. The general rule is that appellate courts will not consider questions which were not raised in the trial courts. <em>State v. Martin, </em>62 Haw. 364, 616 P.2d 193 (1980); State v. <em>Bunn, </em>50 Haw. 351, 354, 440 P.2d 528, 532 (1968); State v. <em>Cummings, </em>49 Haw. 522, 423 P.2d 438 (1967). Therefore, we need not address this issue.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b55-5\">We now turn to appellant\u2019s second contention. At trial, appellant objected to the admission into evidence of two bullets, State\u2019s Exhibits I and K, which were removed on separate occasions from the body of Charles Yee Hoy. Appellant contends that a proper chain of custody was not established. Appellant suggests that great potential for substitution existed; thus, the bullets may not have been the ones removed from Yee Hoy\u2019s body.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-6\">In showing chain of custody, all possibilities of tampering with an exhibit need not be negated. Chain of custody is sufficiently established where it is reasonably certain that no tampering took place, with any doubt going to the weight of the evidence. <em>State v. Antone, </em>62 Haw. 346, 615 P.2d 101 (1980); State v. <em>Vance, </em>61 Haw. 291, 602 P.2d 933 (1979); <em>State v. Olivera, </em>57 Haw. 339, 555 P.2d 1199 (1976). An accounting of hand-to-hand custody of the evidence between the time it is obtained and the time admitted to trial is not required in establishing chain of custody. <em>State v. Payne, </em>612 S.W.2d 353, 356 (Mo. App. 1980). And despite the mere possibility that others may have had access to the exhibits, there exists a reasonable certainty that no tampering took place. <em>Cobb v. </em>State,_Ind__,_, 412 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>N.E.2d 728, 737 (1980). Following these principles, the court in <em>State v. Mayes, </em>286 N.W.2d 387, 391 (Iowa 1979), aptly stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b56-6\">In order to justify the admission of physical evidence it is not required that the chain of custody be shown with perfect precision. The trial court may admit the evidence when satisfied it is:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b56-7\">. . . reasonably probable that tampering, substitution or alteration of evidence did not occur. Absolute certainty is not required.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b56-8\">[The] judge determines the sufficiency of physical evidence identification in light of the article\u2019s nature, circumstances surrounding its custody and the likelihood of intermeddlers tampering with it. A more elaborate foundation is required to identify evidence that is easily substituted, such as marijuana, than is necessary to identify physical evidence with unusual characteristics, such as money, a gun, clothing and a body, or matches and glasses. Unless [the] decision to admit evidence over a chain-of-custody objection constitutes a clear abuse of discretion, it will not be overturned. [Citations omitted.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b56-9\">One of the bullets, State\u2019s Exhibit I, was surgically removed from Yee Hoy\u2019s spinal area at Queen\u2019s Hospital. A hand-to-hand accounting of the chain of custody for this bullet was not presented. However, testimonies of the doctor and hospital personnel reveal that under normal procedures, after a bullet is removed by the doctor, the nurse takes it to pathology. At pathology, the bullet is identified and then sealed in a plastic bag whereupon it is taken to the medical records office for safekeeping until turned over to the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-10\">There is ample testimony in the record showing that State\u2019s Exhibit I was not tampered with and an adequate chain of custody was established. The doctor identified the bullet by its noticeable features of being an unusually large fragment that had rings on it. And the rifling marks on State\u2019s Exhibit I were similar to the markings found on the test bullet fired from the gun used by the appellant. Thus, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in admitting into evidence State\u2019s Exhibit I and in permitting the jury to give due weight to such evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-11\">Then at a later date, another bullet, State\u2019s Exhibit K, was removed from Yee Hoy\u2019s body. This bullet was given directly to Yee Hoy who then placed it in his hospital room drawer. Upon being discharged from the hospital, Yee Hoy put the bullet in his bag and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>eventually placed it in a drawer at home. The bullet was then turned over to the police nineteen days later.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"A6Q\"><em>Keith M. Kiuchi, </em>Deputy Public Defender (on the brief), for defendant-appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"ADh\"><em>Faye M. Koyanagi, </em>Deputy Prosecuting Attorney (on the brief), for plaintiff-appellee.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b57-5\">The mere possibility that others may have had access to State\u2019s Exhibit K does not mean that tampering or substitution occurred. Yee Hoy testified that this bullet looked like the one given to him and which he turned over to the police. Additionally, the rifling marks on this bullet were similar to the markings on the test bullet. From the record, it is reasonably certain that no tampering took place. Having found the chain of custody adequately established, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in admitting into evidence State\u2019s Exhibit K.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b54-19\"> Murder, attempted murder, and carrying a firearm without a permit or license are violations of HRS \u00a7\u00a7 707-701, 705-50\u00d3 &amp; 707-701 and 134-9, respectively.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b55-7\"> Assuming arguendo that we reviewed appellant\u2019s first claim regarding the independent grand jury counsel, our decision in State v. Rodrigues, 63 Haw. 412, 629 P.2d 1111 (1981), is dispositive of the issue. <em>InRodrigues, supra, </em>we held that Article I, Section 11 of the Hawaii Constitution, which created the position of independent grand jury counsel, was not self-executing and needed further legislative action to implement its provisions. We also held that unless shown to be prejudicial, the mere absence of the independent counsel from the grand jury did not violate due process of law. In the instant case, appellant was indicted on March 11, 1980. No showing of prejudice has been made in this record concerning the absence of the independent grand jury counsel.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
