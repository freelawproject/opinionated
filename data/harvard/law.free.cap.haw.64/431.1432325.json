(\u201cMakena Surf\u2019) by co-appellee the Maui County Planning Commission (\u201cplanning commission\u201d) pursuant to HRS chapter 205A, Hawaii\u2019s Coastal Zone Management Act,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> thereby facilitating Makena Surfs con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>struction of a 184-unit condominium development in the vicinity of Poolenalena Beach, Makena. As in his appeal before the second circuit court, appellant here complains of numerous procedural and substantive irregularities in the review and approval of the permit application. Only a few of appellant\u2019s contentions merit our attention, however, and we have confined ourselves to determining whether appellant was properly notified of the planning commission hearing on Makena Surf s application, and whether the commission\u2019s subsequent closed deliberations comported with statutory, charter and rule provisions governing public agency meetings. Finding both charter and rule violations but no reversible error, we sustain the lower court\u2019s affirmance of the planning commission\u2019s decision granting the SMA use permit.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-5\">Makena Surf submitted its application for an SMA use permit to the planning commission on December 11, 1979. The commission scheduled a hearing on the application for February 26,1980, which was later reset for March 11, 1980. Notice of the rescheduled hearing was published in the Maui News and Honolulu Advertiser on February 6, 1980.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> A separate notice of the March 11 hearing, entitled \u201cNotice of Special Management Area Hearing,\u201d appeared in the Maui News on February 8,1980, and in the Honolulu Advertiser on the following day. This announcement identified the subject <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>of the permit application, gave the date, time and place of the hearing, mentioned that information relating to Makena Surfs application was available for public inspection at the county planning department, and advised that \u201c[a]ny person seeking to be admitted as a party must do so at least fifteen (15) days prior to said hearing and comply with the provisions of Article I, Part II, Section 1-13 of the Maui Planning Commission rules.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The notice additionally recited that the hearings would be held under the authority of HRS chapters 205A and 91 and specified Maui Planning Commission Rules and Regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-6\">As an adjoining landowner, appellant received a \u201cNotice of Special Management Area Hearing\u201d from Makena Surf by certified mail on or about February 13,1980, as required by Planning Commission Rule 2-11.3.f. Virtually identical to that described above, this notice additionally informed its recipient that any party could be represented by counsel. Makena Surf also enclosed a letter notifying appellant of a \u201cpublic hearing\u201d on the permit application set for March 11, describing the proposed development and informing appellant that testimony pertaining to the application could be submitted in advance to the planning commission or in person at the hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-7\">On February 26, 1980, appellant wrote to the planning director seeking party status at the March 11 hearing.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Representatives of the planning department and corporation counsel met with appellant on March 6 to discuss his request. They attempted to review with appellant the commission procedures for intervention and advised him to seek the services of an attorney. Appellant apparently responded to the suggestion by stating that he did not plan to use a lawyer at the hearing and that he felt he did better without one.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-8\">Appellant attended the March 11 hearing, but because the commission lacked a quorum for the matter of Makena Surfs application, the hearing on the permit request was postponed until April 8, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>1980. Notice of the new hearing date appeared in the Maui News and Honolulu Advertiser on March 24, 1980. Entitled \u201cNotice of Rescheduled Special Management Area Hearing,\u201d the newspaper column again described the application\u2019s subject, noted that the hearing was to be governed by HRS chapters 205A and 91, and advised that project information was open for public inspection. Appellant also received an agenda of the April 8 meeting in the mail on or about April 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-5\">The planning commission granted appellant\u2019s request for inter-, venor status at the commencement of the April 8 hearing, which appellant attended. The first portion of the hearing was devoted to the receipt of evidence and testimony of witnesses representing the planning department and Makena Surf, both parties to the hearing. Appellant, not represented by an attorney, was given the opportunity to cross-examine each witness, to object to evidence introduced, to present testimony on his behalf, and to make a closing statement. Aside from questioning Makena Surfs project representative, however, appellant declined to exercise any of his rights as a party. The planning commission then received the written and oral testimony of twenty-five persons in the audience, as agreed to by all parties in a pre-hearing conference.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-6\">Following closed deliberations, the planning commission issued its Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, Decision and Orders on May 15, 1980, in which it approved Makena Surfs SMA use permit application subject to Makena Surfs compliance with enumerated conditions. Appellant, now represented by counsel, filed a motion for reconsideration on June 17, 1980, seeking to have the planning commission vacate its order granting the SMA use permit for the commission\u2019s alleged failure to comply with the federal Coastal Zone Management Act, the Hawaii Revised Statutes, and the planning commission rules relative to notice and conduct of the permit application hearing and to the substantive requirements for permit issuance.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The commission denied appellant\u2019s motion, and appellant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>sought review of the denial in circuit court. Appellant also filed a motion to remand the case to the planning commission for the taking of additional evidence pursuant to HRS \u00a7 91-14(e) and for the commission\u2019s written reasons for its denial of appellant\u2019s motion, as required by Planning Commission Rule 1-33. The circuit court disagreed with virtually all of appellant\u2019s contentions, and issued an order granting in part and denying in part appellant\u2019s motion to remand.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> As this action disposed of the merits of appellant\u2019s earlier appeal by stipulation of the parties, appellant now approaches this court to challenge the correctness of the circuit court\u2019s ruling.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b450-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-7\">At the outset we observe the Makena Surfs SMA use permit application proceeding was a \u201ccontested case\u201d within the meaning of HRS chapter 91, the Hawaii Administrative Procedure Act (\u201cHAPA\u201d), as the parties\u2019 legal rights and duties \u201care required by law to be determined after an opportunity for agency hearing.\u201d HRS \u00a7 91-1(5) (1976); Planning Commission Rule 2-11.3. h; <em>see City of Coronado v. California Coastal Zone Conservation Commission, </em>69 Cal. App.3d 570, 138 Cal. Rptr. 241 (1977); <em>Town v. Land Use Commission, </em>55 Haw. 538, 524 P.2d 84 (1974). The state Coastal Zone Management Act and corresponding planning commission rules specifically make HRS \u00a7 91-9 and planning commission contested case procedures applicable to proceedings on SMA use permit applications in Maui County. <em>See </em>HRS \u00a7 205A-29(a); Planning Commission Rule 2-11.3.f, .g, .h; 1-4.4; 1-14 to 1-33. This appeal is thus governed by HRS \u00a791-14(1976&amp; Supp. 1981) which provides for judicial review <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>of contested cases and authorizes this court to reverse or modify the planning commission\u2019s order \u201cif the substantial rights of the petitioners may have been prejudiced because the administrative findings, conclusions, decisions, or orders are: (1) In violation of constitutional or statutory provisions; or. .. (2) Made upon unlawful procedure; or . . . (3) Affected by other error of law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b451-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-6\">Appellant first charges that appellees failed to provide formal notice of the April 8 hearing within the twenty-five and thirty-day time limits prescribed by the applicable statutes and planning commission rules. As appellant had received notice by publication and certified mail of the March 11 hearing in accordance with the law, and on three later occasions was notified by appellees of the changed hearing date, the issue presented is whether appellees were required to provide these subsequent notices of the rescheduled hearing within the time constraints applicable to notice of the hearing as originally scheduled.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-7\">HRS \u00a7 205A-29(a) (1976 &amp; Supp. 1981) requires the appropriate county authority to establish rules pursuant to HRS chapter 91 pertaining to SMA us\u00e9 permit application procedures. It directs that provision be made for adequate notice of hearings on permit applications to individuals whose property rights may be affected, and states that the authority shall publish notice once in a newspaper of general statewide circulation at least twenty days prior to the hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-8\">Planning Commission Rule 2-11.3.g, promulgated in response to the above statutory mandate, requires the Maui County Planning Director to publish notice of hearings on SMA use permit applications once each in newspapers of statewide and countywide circulation not less than thirty calendar days prior to the hearing. In addition, Rule 2-11.3.f directs SMA use permit applicants to provide such notice by certified mail to all owners of property situated within five hundred feet of the project situs not less than twenty-five calendar days prior to the hearing date. Both notices must describe the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>nature of the proposed action, state the time and place of the hearing, and provide other information as required by HRS chapters 91 and 92.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b452-6\">Neither HRS \u00a7 205A-29, HRS chapter 91 and 92, nor the planning commission rules require that notice of a meeting rescheduled for a later date be provided within the thirty or twenty-five day limits imposed on the original notice. Nor do we find justification to abrogate well-established canons of statutory construction by reading such a requirement into the laws despite their unambiguous language, <em>see In re Tax Appeal of Hawaiian Telephone Company, </em>61 Haw. 572, 577-78, 608 P.2d 383, 387 (1980); <em>In re Spencer, </em>60 Haw. 497, 499, 591 P.2d 611, 613 (1979), where to do so is mandated neither by the purposes behind the notice provisions nor by requirements of due process in the circumstances of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-7\">The notice and hearing requirements of Hawaii\u2019s Coastal Zone Management Act, HRS chapter 205A, were devised to assure a \u201c[f]ull and effective opportunity for public involvement in the [SMA] use permit system,\u201d which the legislature deemed both necessary and desirable in the decision-making processes affecting Hawaii\u2019s coastal zone. House Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 679, 8th Haw. Leg., 1st Sess., <em>reprinted in </em>House Journal 1271-, 1272 (1975); Senate Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 143, 8th Haw. Leg., 1st Sess., <em>reprinted in </em>Senate Journal 916, 917 (1975). Appellant has neither alleged nor otherwise established, however, that his opportunity for full and effective participation was in any way prejudiced by his failure to receive notice of the rescheduling within the above time limits. No showing was made that appellant lacked ample opportunity prior to the March 11 hearing, of which timely notice was given, to prepare his case. Appellant attended the March 11 proceeding, at which time <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>he heard oral announcement of the changed date. He subsequently received written notice of the same from the March 24 newspaper announcement and the meeting agenda sent him, and in fact attended and participated in the April 8 hearing without requesting a postponement.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-5\">In short, while notice of a rescheduling complying with the time provisions of HRS \u00a7 205A-29 and the planning commission rules may be warranted in certain instances to prevent hardship or unfair surprise, as where the subject matter changes for the later hearing, it was clearly not required here where appellant had received notice of the schedule change at the earliest possible date and suffered no prejudice to his participation right's. <em>Cf. Moskovitz v. City of St. Paul, </em>218 Minn. 543, 16 N.W.2d 745 (1944) (no due process violation by postponing meeting four days since plaintiff attended both proceedings and failed to request continuance, and where hearing\u2019s subject matter remained identical). We thus turn to consider appellant\u2019s remaining arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-6\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-7\">Appellant\u2019s second contention is that the planning commission failed to render appellant proper notice of the contested case proceeding in conformity with the requirements of HRS \u00a7 91 -9, thereby violating his constitutional right to due process as evidenced by his failure to effectively exercise his rights as a participant at the April 8 hearing. We need respond only briefly to this allegation, as we find no basis for it in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-8\">HRS \u00a7 91-9(b) (1976 &amp; Supp. 1979), dictating the content of published and mailed notice of hearings on SMA use permit applications in Maui County at the time of Makena Surf s application, <em>see </em>Planning Commission Rules 2-11.3.f, .g, required that such notice contain a statement of the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b453-9\">(1) The date, time, place, and nature of hearing;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b453-10\">(2) The legal authority under which the hearing is to be held;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b453-11\">(3) The particular sections of the statutes and rules involved;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b453-12\">(4) An explicit statement in plain language of the issues involved and the facts alleged by the agency in support thereof; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>provided, that if the agency is unable to state such issues and facts in detail at the time the notice is served, the initial notice may be limited to a statement of the issues involved, and thereafter upon application a bill of particulars shall be furnished;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b454-6\">(5) The fact that any party may retain counsel if he so desires.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b454-7\">Notice of the SMA hearing as originally scheduled for March 11, printed in the Maui News and Honolulu Advertiser, complied with all of HRS \u00a7 91-9\u2019s requirements for notice in contested cases except that it failed to state that any party could be represented by counsel. The notice sent by Makena Surf to appellant, however, did make this clear and complied in all other respects with \u00a7 91-9. Furthermore, appellant was orally advised by planning department and corporation counsel representatives to retain the services of an attorney for the hearing, and was sent a copy of the planning commission rules regarding intervention which made reference to a party\u2019s right to be represented by counsel. Thus while the planning commission may have committed a technical statutory violation in its published notices, appellant cannot be heard to complain of harm or injustice caused thereby as he subsequently received ample notice of his right to representation both informally and by notice sent by Makena Surf in full compliance with the statute and rules.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-8\">Appellant\u2019s charge that his failure to produce witnesses and effectively present his case on April 8 was due to his lack of notice of the contested case proceeding thus amounts to little more than an unfounded attempt inspired by hindsight to attain a second opportunity to block the permit application. While we do not condone the planning commission\u2019s behavior in granting appellant intervenor status only at the commencement of the hearing, we must conclude that appellees had consistently treated the matter of Makena Surfs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>application as a contested case proceeding,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and that appellant was fully apprised of his rights as a potential party prior to the hearing. His decision to participate rather than seek an extension of time may not now be rescinded by attributing it to appellees\u2019 actions, which were in substantial compliance with the law and cannot be held the cause of appellant\u2019s performance. <em>See Brown v. Sutton, </em>356 So.2d 965 (La. 1978). Moreover, \u201c[a]s a general proposition, it is reasonable to expect one with knowledge of notice of an administrative proceeding affecting his rights not to stand by until the day of the hearing and then for the first time assert lack of notice.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 972.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-5\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-6\">Finally, appellant seeks the voidance of Makena Surfs SMA use permit for the planning commission\u2019s failure to open its final deliberations on the permit application and on appellant\u2019s motion for reconsideration and petition for declaratory ruling to the public in violation of HRS \u00a7 92-3, the planning commission rules and the Maui County Charter. Our study of the pertinent laws<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> leads us to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>agree that both the rules and charter were violated, but nevertheless that Makena Surfs SMA use permit must stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-4\">HRS chapter 92, popularly known as the state\u2019s Sunshine Law, was enacted in 1975 on the legislature\u2019s belief that \u201c[o]pening up the governmental processes to public scrutiny is the only viable and reasonable method of protecting the public\u2019s interest.\u201d HRS \u00a7 92-1 (1976). The law\u2019s blanket mandate is contained in HRS \u00a7 92-3. (1976), which requires that \u201c[e]very meeting of all boards ... be open to the public and all persons ... be permitted to attend any meeting unless otherwise provided in the constitution or as closed pursuant to sections 92-4 and 92-5.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b456-5\">While neither the state constitution nor HRS \u00a7\u00a7 92-4 and 92-5 apply to exempt the planning commission\u2019s meetings from the above requirement, HRS \u00a7 92-6(a)(2) (1976) renders the statute inapplicable to \u201cadjudicatory functions exercised by a board and governed by sections 91-8 and 91 -9, or authorized by other sections of the Hawaii Revised Statutes.\u201d The Senate Judiciary Committee, noting that closed deliberations are traditionally used in quasi-judicial proceedings, found no objection in allowing the practice to continue \u201cas [the] availability of procedural safeguards, transcripts, written decisions, and the appellate process, all work to permit adequate public scrutiny as well as insure fairness and required observance of constitutional rights.\u201d Senate Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 878, 8th Haw. Leg., 1st Sess., <em>reprinted in </em>Senate Journal 1177, 1178 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b456-6\">As we found above, the adjudicatory functions of the Maui County Planning Commission in issuing or denying SMA use permit requests are governed, <em>inter alia, </em>by HRS \u00a7 91-9 and HAPA\u2019s other provisions. Appellant, however, attempts to analogize the planning commission\u2019s adjudicatory functions to those of the state Land Use Commission, to which the open meeting requirement specifically applies, <em>see </em>HRS \u00a7 92-6(b) (1976), in arguing the inapplicability of HRS \u00a7 92-6(a)(2)\u2019s exclusion provision to the commission\u2019s closed deliberations. Once again, however, we decline appellant\u2019s suggestion that this court assume legislative powers by writing into the statutes what the legislature did. not. HRS \u00a7 92-6(b) recites that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>deliberations of the Land Use Commission in the exercise of its adjudicatory functions shall be open to the public notwithstanding \u00a7 92-6(a)(2)\u2019s exemption of adjudicatory functions in contested cases from the general open-meeting requirement. The provision\u2019s legislative history, again naming only the Land Use Commission as its subject, indicates that the provision was not intended to encompass county or other state agencies acting on land matters.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b457-5\">We therefore hold that HRS \u00a7 92-6(a) does not apply to the Maui County Planning Commission in its exercise of its adjudicatory functions under the circumstances of this case, and consequently that the commission\u2019s closed deliberations on Makena Surfs permit application and on appellant\u2019s subsequent motion and petition were permissible under HRS \u00a7 92-6(a)(2) despite the open-meeting mandate of HRS \u00a7 92-3. This conclusion does not dispose of the matter, however, for we find that the commission\u2019s closed meetings nonetheless ran afoul of the planning commission rules and Maui County Charter.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-6\">Planning Commission Rule 1-6, applicable to proceedings before the commission generally, requires the commission to open all of its meetings<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> to the public \u201c[e]xcept as provided for by law.\u201d We have found no applicable laws either specific or general allowing the planning commission to hold closed deliberations on SMA use permit applications.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Planning Commission Rule 1-33, pertaining to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>the commission\u2019s reconsideration of its decisions and orders generally, completely omits mention of a hearing on a petition for reconsideration, requiring only that denials and reasons therefor be set forth in writing. Moreover, the Maui County Charter, in \u00a7 13-9, has long prohibited boards and commissions from taking any official action \u201cexcept at a meeting open to the public in accordance with the law.\u201d The charter does not provide exceptions to this mandate, nor, again, have we found any in the network of laws affecting SMA use permit application proceedings.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b458-6\">While it thus appears that the planning commission acted in contravention of the charter and its own rules, however, it does not follow that appellant is entitled to the voidance of Makena Surfs SMA use permit. Once again we turn to HRS \u00a7 91-14(a),<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> describing the scope of this appeal, and find that appellant has failed to allege or otherwise establish that his substantial rights may have been prejudiced by the commission\u2019s closure of its deliberations. Appellant\u2019s main argument that the public must be afforded the opportunity to insure that public agency decisions are \u201cabove reproach\u201d and not products of \u201cback-room politics,\u201d while stating sound policy reasons for sunshine provisions, does not describe how either apply to the planning commission\u2019s decision on Makena Surfs application. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>On the other hand, the commission\u2019s written Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, Decision and Order, to which appellant fails to allude in this portion of his argument, reveals a decision reached after proper consideration of the SMA guidelines set forth in HRS \u00a7 205A-26 (1976 <em>8c </em>Supp. 1981), the state Coastal Zone Management Program objectives and policies contained in HRS \u00a7 205A-2 (Supp. 1981), and the planning commission\u2019s SMA rules and regulations. <em>See </em>Planning Commission Rule 2-11.4.c. In the absence of any allegation of impropriety occurring during the closed deliberations that may have contributed to the commission\u2019s decision to the prejudice of appellant, we must sustain the circuit court\u2019s order allowing the commission\u2019s decision granting Maicena Surfs SMA use permit and confine appellant to seeking the appropriate remedies as may be provided by charter or rule.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<attorneys id=\"AV0\"><em>JonathanD.

The court, by order dated December 9, 1981, decided to consider the motion contemporaneously with the merits of this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b452-8\"> HRS chapter 92, entitled \u201cPublic Agency Meetings and Records,\u201d contains notice requirements in \u00a7 92-7 which apply independently of those in HRS \u00a7 91-9 and govern announcements of regular, special or rescheduled board meetings. As we find herein, however, Part I of HRS chapter 92, dealing specifically with board meetings and including \u00a7 92-7, does not apply to the Maui County Planning Commission in its exercise of adjudicatory functions governed by HRS \u00a7 91-8 and \u00a7 91-9. <em>See </em>HRS \u00a7 92-6(a)(2). The requirements of HRS \u00a7 92-7 were therefore applicable to the planning commission hearing in question only to the extent that the commission intended to hold a \u201cpublic hearing\u201d in addition to a contested case hearing.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b454-9\"> The 1980 Legislature amended subsection 5 of HRS \u00a7 91-9(b) to require notice of:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b454-10\">[t]he fact that any party may retain counsel if he so desires and the fact that an individual may appear on his own behalf, or a member of a partnership may represent the partnership, or an officer or authorized employee of a corporation or trust or association may represent the corporation, trust, or association.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b455-7\"> Although the notice published in the Maui News and Honolulu Advertiser on January 28 and February 6, 1980 also characterized the March 11 hearing as a \u201cpublic hearing,\u201d <em>see </em>note 2 <em>supra, </em>and while the planning commission did receive public testimony at the conclusion of the contested case portion of the hearing, the notices of the \u201cSpecial Management Area Hearing\u201d quite clearly announced that the hearing would be governed by HAPA and HRS chapter 205A which refer to contested case procedures.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b455-8\"> The question of open deliberations in an SMA proceeding requires examination of HRS chapter 205A, chapter 91 and the planning commission rules pertaining to both SMA and general planning commission proceedings, in addition to HRS chapter 92 and the county charter. HRS \u00a7 205A-29(a) refers the county authority to chapter 91 in its promulgation of rules governing SMA use permit hearings but is otherwise silent on the manner in which the hearings must be conducted. Article II of the planning commission rules, pertaining specifically to special management areas, likewise refrains from providing any directive on the matter and requires only that the SMA use permit hearing be conducted in accordance with planning commission rules regarding contested cases generally. These rules, found in Article I, Parts III, IV and V, do not dictate the manner in which the planning commission deliberate over the permit subsequent to the hearing. Only Planning Commission Rule 1-6 governing commission meetings generally states that \u201c[e]xcept as provided for by law, all of [the commission\u2019s] meetings shall be open to the public. <em>See </em>discussion <em>infra </em>as to its application to this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b456-7\"> This requirement is made applicable to all political subdivisions of the state by HRS \u00a7 92-71 (1976).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b457-7\"> Conf.

Maui County Ordinance No. 717, \u00a7 1 <em>(1972), reprinted in </em>Maui County Code \u00a7 1.12.020 (1980), provides for a penalty of not more than $1,000.00, imprisonment of not more than one year, or both, for intentional violations of duties prescribed by charter or violations of prohibitions provided for therein.
