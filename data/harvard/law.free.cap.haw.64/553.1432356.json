We granted certiorari to review the Intermediate Court of Appeals\u2019 decision that the family court abused its discretion in doing so because the appellate court\u2019s application of the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction Act, HRS Chapter 588, appeared at odds with <em>Griffith v. Griffith, </em>60 Haw. 567, 592 P.2d 826 (1979). From an examination of the record we conclude the family court\u2019s decision not to assume jurisdiction was proper, and reverse the appellate court.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-9\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-10\">The dispositive facts are simple and largely undisputed. Plaintiff-appellee, Cross-appellant Linda Mary Allen (Mrs. Allen) and Defendant-appellant, Cross-appellee Scott Ethan Allen (Mr. Allen) were married in New York on December 21, 1977. They established a domicile in New Jersey in July of 1978 when they moved into a house Mr. Allen had inherited from his father. Their only child, Christian Scott Allen (Christian), was born in New Jersey on August 6, 1979; he lived with his parents in the family home in Smoke Rise, New Jersey until the middle of September in 1980 when the couple separated. Mrs. Allen and Christian then lived for a short while with her parents who were also residents of New Jersey.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-11\">Mrs. Allen arrived in Hawaii with Christian on October 2, 1980; she commenced the proceedings now before us on October 8, 1980. Since she could satisfy neither the requirement of domicile or physical presence within the circuit for three months, as specified by HRS \u00a7 580-1 \u201cin matters of annulment, divorce, and separation,\u201d nor the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>prerequisite of six months\u2019 residence in the State prescribed therein for divorce actions, she purported to.invoke the court\u2019s equity powers in seeking a separate maintenance decree. She petitioned for a decree permitting her to live separate and apart from Mr. Allen and orders granting her custody of Christian, support for herself and the child, and attorney\u2019s fees and costs. She simultaneously sought orders awarding her custody of Christian and restraining Mr. Allen from removing the child from the circuit pending the determination of the case; the requested temporary relief was granted <em>ex parte.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b569-5\">Mr. Allen commenced proceedings for a custody determination in New Jersey on October 29, 1980, seeking <em>inter alia, </em>orders restraining Mrs. Allen from prosecuting a custody action elsewhere and requiring her to return Christian to New Jersey. Relief as prayed for was granted by the New Jersey court on November 21, 1980. He then appeared in the Hawaii court through counsel for the specific purpose of contesting the court\u2019s authority to make a custody determination involving Christian.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-6\">The motion to dismiss Mrs. Allen\u2019s suit and for an order requiring the return of the child to New Jersey was decided by the family court on February 18, 1981. After considering \u201cthe arguments and the affidavits, records and files presented in support and opposition to said motion,\u201d the court dismissed the action for lack of jurisdiction and because \u201cHawaii is an inconvenient and inappropriate forum.\u201d It ordered Mrs. Allen to return the child to New Jersey within five days; it further enjoined the prosecution of a marital or custodial action by Mrs. Allen in any jurisdiction other than New Jersey. The order for the return of the child, however, was subsequently stayed pending an appeal to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-7\">The appeal was assigned to the Intermediate Court of Appeals for hearing and disposition. The appellate court concluded there was a basis for the family court\u2019s exercise of jurisdiction in HRS \u00a7 583-3(a)(2),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> which provides that a State court competent to decide <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>child custody questions has jurisdiction to determine an interstate child custody dispute if it is in the best interest of the child.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In the appellate court\u2019s view, the family court thus erred in concluding it lacked jurisdiction and in also concluding Hawaii was an inconvenient and inappropriate forum without an \u201cadversary\u201d hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-7\">The Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction Act (the Act) has been adopted by both states<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> involved in the instant custody battle in substantially the form approved by the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws and the American Bar Association in 1968.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The move for consistency in determining jurisdiction in the relevant area was prompted by a \u201cgrowing public concern over the fact that thousands of children are shifted from state to state and from one family to another every year while their parents or other persons battle over their custody in the courts of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>several states,\u201d Commissioners\u2019 Prefatory Note, Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction Act (9 U.L.A.) at 111, and the Commissioners\u2019 perception that \u201c[t]his unfortunate state of affairs has been aided and facilitated rather than discouraged by the law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 112.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Statutory law in the area of concern was lacking, and a \u201cmedley of discordant [judicial] decisions provide[d] neither a consistent set of rules nor an intelligible guide for those who . . . [were compelled to] resort to institutional settlement of custody disputes.\u201d Ratner, <em>Child Custody in a Federal System, </em>62 Mich. L. Rev. 795, 798-99 (1964). The unsettled situation and the absence of constructive guidelines were exemplified by Restatement provisions declaring that the state where the child is domiciled, the state where he is physically present, and the state where the defendant is legally present possessed concurrent authority to determine the child\u2019s custody. RESTATEMENT (SECOND) OF CONFLICT OF LAWS \u00a7 79 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b571-5\">Since the Act broke new ground, the Commissioners set forth its purposes in detail. <em>See </em>Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction Act (9 U.L.A.) \u00a7 1 and Commissioners\u2019 Note at 117. Some of these purposes were the avoidance of jurisdictional competition and conflict, cooperation among state courts, and the deterrence of abduction and other unilateral removals of children. The Commissioners\u2019 draft also provided that the Act should be read and applied with the stated objectives in mind. <em>Id. </em>The foregoing goals as well as the admonition to construe the law consistently therewith were ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>pressly ratified by the State legislature.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Our task then is to ascertain whether the family court\u2019s decision not to exercise jurisdiction was correct under the provisions of HRS \u00a7 583-3, \u201cconstrued to promote the general purposes stated\u201d in HRS \u00a7 583-1.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-7\">Four possible bases for family court jurisdiction over an interstate child custody dispute are established by HRS \u00a7 583-3. The statute confers authority for the court to act if: (1) Hawaii is the child\u2019s home state when proceedings are commenced or it had been the home state within six months thereof but the child has been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>removed from the State; or (2) it is in the child\u2019s best interest for the court to assume jurisdiction because of a significant connection between the child and at least one of the parties and the State and because substantial evidence relating to the present or future care of the child is available in Hawaii; or (3) the child is physically present in the State and has been abandoned or an emergency situation with respect to his care exists; or (4) no other state apparently has jurisdiction over the controversy or another state has deferred to Hawaii in the matter. But the third and fourth grounds for the exercise of authority are obviously inapplicable to the present controversy, and we focus our inquiry on whether there was a basis under HRS \u00a7 583-3(a)(l) or (2) for the family court to settle the dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-5\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-6\">The family court undoubtedly would have had cause to assume jurisdiction in the interstate custody fight by virtue of HRS \u00a7 583-3(a)(1)(A) if Hawaii happened to be Christian\u2019s home state when proceedings began. However, \u201chome state\u201d is defined by HRS \u00a7 583-2(5) as \u201cthe state in which the child immediately preceding the time involved lived with his parents, a parent, or a person acting as a parent, for at least six consecutive months.\u201d And as Mrs. Allen and Christian had been in this State for only six days when suit was filed, the child\u2019s home state for relevant purposes could not have been Hawaii. Nor could jurisdiction have attached under the alternative test prescribed by HRS \u00a7 583-3(a)(l)(B), for the removal in question was from New Jersey.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-7\">In <em>Griffith v. Griffith, supra, </em>where we were called upon to apply \u00a7 583-3(a)(l)(B) in a situation where a child had been removed from Hawaii, we concluded the jurisdictional test therein described serves to extend \u201cthe jurisdiction of a former home state . .. during the six month period while a child is acquiring a new home state by residence there.\u201d 60 Haw. at 574,592 P.2d at 831. A former home state, we said, \u201ccontinued to possess jurisdiction\u201d though it was not accorded \u201cthe status of a home state.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Under our reading of \u00a7 583-3(a)(l)(B), a court of Christian\u2019s recent home state, New Jersey, retained power to determine his custody for at least six months after his removal pursuant to similar provisions in the New Jersey stat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>ute.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> But the acceptance of jurisdiction by a Hawaii court under proper circumstances was still a possibility because the Act recognizes that two states may have concurrent jurisdiction in some situations until one of them determines it has a reason for assuming authority that overrides the other\u2019s interest in a case. The reference here is, of course, to \u00a7 583-3(a)(2), which sanctions the exercise of authority if \u201cit is in the best interest of the child.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b574-6\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-7\">We concluded in <em>Griffith v. Griffith, supra, </em>60 Haw. at 574, 592 P.2d at 831, that \u00a7 583-3(a)(2) called for a \u201cjudgmental test\u201d to decide what is in the child\u2019s best interest. But we also acknowledged there were preconditions to the invocation of jurisdiction thereunder. Our statement in this regard was:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b574-8\">Here a judgmental test is involved. The California court would have, under this test, jurisdiction which ousts the Hawaii court of its jurisdiction under \u00a7 583-3(a)(2)(A), only if \u201cit is in the best interest of the child\u201d that a California court assume jurisdiction. That conclusion could not be reached unless the conditions of \u00a7\u00a7 583-3(a)(2)(A) and (B) were satisfied, <em>i.e., </em>that <em>both </em>the child and one of his parents had a significant connection with California, and that substantial evidence of the child\u2019s present or future care, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>protection, training and personal relationships was present in California.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b575-6\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b575-7\">The dispositive facts recounted earlier fail to manifest the requisite connection or that substantial evidence of the child\u2019s present or future care, protection, training and personal relationship was present in Hawaii. Physical presence of the child and one of the contestants \u201cis not alone sufficient to confer jurisdiction on a court of this State to make a child custody determination,\u201d HRS \u00a7 583-3(b), Christian had no prior contact with Hawaii, and Mrs. Allen\u2019s previous connection with the State, which antedated her marriage to Mr. Allen, could hardly be deemed significant for purposes of making a child custody determination. Hence, neither \u00a7 583-3(a)(l) nor \u00a7 583-3(a)(2) furnished a valid reason for the family court to entertain a custody case whose roots lay elsewhere. <em>See Both v. Superior Court, </em>121 Ariz. 381, 590 P.2d 920 <em>(1979); In re Marriage of Ben-Yehoshua, </em>91 Cal. App.3d 259, 154 Cal. Rptr. 80 (1979); <em>Griffith v. Griffith, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b575-8\"><em>A </em>consideration of the family court\u2019s action in the light of the uniform law\u2019s purposes reinforces our conclusion that the court did not err when it refused to hear the matter. A decision to assume jurisdiction would not have been consonant with objectives such as the avoidance ofjurisdictional competition and conflict, cooperation among state courts, and the deterrence of abduction and other unilateral removals of children from one state to another. <em>See </em>note 5 <em>supra. </em>It would also have been contrary to the Commissioners\u2019 expression that the pertinent paragraph is meant \u201cto limit jurisdiction rather than to proliferate it.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b576-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-4\">Having decided that the family court\u2019s application of \u00a7 583-3\u2019s jurisdictional tests was fundamentally sound, we turn to Mrs. Allen\u2019s claim of error on the court\u2019s denial of her request to adduce testimony relating to \u201cthe best interest of the child.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b576-5\">At the outset of the hearing on Mr. Allen\u2019s motion to dismiss Mrs. Allen\u2019s complaint, the court announced it would concern itself only with the \u201cjurisdictional facts.\u201d We can find no fault with this, for \u201c[t]he thrust of the Act <em>isjurisdictional,\u201d In re </em>Lemond,_Ind. App. _, _, 395 N.E.2d 1287, 1292 (1979). The necessary jurisdictional facts appeared in the ple\u00e1dings and affidavits submitted by both parties, and as we observed earlier, they were largely undisputed. Since a legal foundation for the court to consider more than the jurisdictional facts was absent, Mrs. Allen\u2019s plea was properly denied.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b576-8\">The family court, however, subsequently adopted findings of fact and conclusions of law on its being an \u201cinconvenient forum\u201d in a form proposed by Mr. Allen\u2019s counsel. We agree with the appellate court that some of these findings and conclusions were probably unfounded because no evidentiary hearing was conducted. But inasmuch as the court\u2019s primary holding that there was no basis <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>under \u00a7 583-3 for the exercise of jurisdiction is adequately supported by the record, no useful purpose would be served by a present remand for an evidentiary hearing \u2014 <em>the forum non conveniens </em>ruling was a superfluity.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<attorneys id=\"AMlf\">\u2022 <em>Shackley F. Raffetto (Mukai, Ichiki, Raffetto id MacMillan, </em>of counsel) and co-counsel <em>Donald Friedman (Friedman, Carney id Wilson, </em>of counsel) for defendant-appellant, cross-appellee.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"AU9\"><em>Paul R. Mancini (Case, Kay id Lynch, </em>of counsel) for plaintiffappellee, cross-appellant.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b577-5\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-6\">The appellate court further concluded the judge\u2019s failure to place the substance of his conversation with a judge in New Jersey on record was error. We concur that the substance of the conversation should have been made a matter of record. Yet, in view of our conclusion that the parties\u2019 pleadings and affidavits supplied a well-grounded reason for the dismissal of the suit, the neglect could not have been prejudicial.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-7\">The complaint filed by Mrs. Allen was technically a separate maintenance suit, but the primary relief it sought was an award of custody. While the court presumably has power to enter a decree permitting her to live separate and apart from Mr. Allen, no purpose would be served by a remand of only the marital action. The residence and venue provisions of HRS Chapter 580 pose no barrier to a divorce or separation action if Mrs. Allen now chooses to file one.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-8\">The family court\u2019s dismissal of the action is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b569-8\"> HRS \u00a7 583-3(a) reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b569-9\"><em>Jurisdiction, </em>(a) A court of this State which is competent to decide child custody matters hasjurisdiction to make a child custody determination by initial or modification decree if:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b569-10\">(1) This State (A) is the home state of the child at the time of commencement of the proceeding, or (B) had been the child's home state within six months before commencement of the proceeding and the child is absent from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>this State because of his removal or retention by a person claiming his custody or for other reasons, and a parent or person acting as parent continues to live in this State; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b570-9\">(2) It is in the best interest of the child that a court of this State assume jurisdiction because (A) the child and his parents, or the child and at least one contestant, have a significant connection with this State, and (B) there is available in this State substantial evidence concerning the child\u2019s present or future care, protection, training, and personal relationships; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b570-10\">(3) The child is physically present in this State and (A) the child has been abandoned or (B) it is necessary in an emergency to protect the child because he has been subjected to or threatened with mistreatment or abuse or is otherwise neglected or dependent; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b570-11\">(4) (A) It appears that no other state would have jurisdiction under prerequisites substantially in accordance with paragraphs (1), (2), or (3), or another state has declined to exercise jurisdiction on the ground that this State is the more appropriate forum to determine the custody of the child, and (B) it is in the best interest of the child, that this court assume jurisdiction.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b570-12\"> We read the appellate court\u2019s opinion to mean that, from the facts presented, the family court had jurisdiction, not merely to determine jurisdiction, but also to decide the case on its merits.

There is no certainty as to which state has jurisdiction when persons seeking custody of a child approach the courts of several states simultaneously or successively.

The provision makes clear that the stay-at-home parent, if he acts promptly, may start proceedings in his own state if he desires, without the necessity of attem pting to base jurisdiction on paragraph (2). This changes the law in those states which required presence of the child as a condition for jurisdiction and consequently forced the person left behind to follow the departed person to another state, perhaps to several states in succession.

The paragraph was phrased in general terms in order to be flexible enough to cover many fact situations too diverse to lend themselves to exact description. But its purpose is to limit jurisdiction rather than to proliferate it. The first clause of the paragraph is important: jurisdiction exists only if it is in the <em>chilis </em>interest, not merely the interest or convenience of the feuding parties, to determine custody in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>a particular state. The interest of the child is served when the forum has optimum access to relevant evidence about the child and family. There must be maximum rather than minimum contact with the state. The submission of the parties to a forum, perhaps for purposes of divorce, is not sufficient without additional factors establishing closer ties with the state. Divorce jurisdiction does not necessarily include custody jurisdiction.
