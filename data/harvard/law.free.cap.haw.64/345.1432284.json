The State asserts attorneys\u2019 fees should not have been awarded because HRS \u00a7 346-33<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> renders public assistance payments <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>inalienable. Assuming <em>arguendo </em>that the awards of attorneys\u2019 fees are not statutorily precluded, the State maintains the circuit court nevertheless abused its discretion in determining the amounts. Plaintiffsappellees counter with a proposition that the State lacks standing to appeal as it was not aggrieved by the circuit court\u2019s orders. We agree with the State that it has standing to appeal from the orders awarding fees and with Plaintiffs-appellees that HRS \u00a7 346-33 does not inhibit the circuit court\u2019s power to award fees in the situations involved. We conclude, however, that the circuit court erred in fixing the awarded amounts, and remand the cases for redeterminations of the fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-7\">AFDC is a program established by Title IV of the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 601-613, and \u201cdesigned to provide financial assistance to needy dependent children and the parents or relatives who live with and care for them,\u201d <em>Shea v. Vialpando, </em>416 U.S. 251, 253 (1974). It \u201cis based on a scheme of cooperative federalism,\u201d <em>King v. Smith, </em>392 U.S. 309, 316 (1968), \u201cfinanced in large measure by the Federal Government on a matching-fund basis,. . . [where] participating States must submit AFDC plans in conformity with the Act and the regulations promulgated thereunder.\u201d <em>Shea v. Vialpando, supra, </em>at 253. Although the States are given broad discretion in administering the program, noncompliance with federal requirements can result in a cut-off of matching funds. <em>Rosado v. Wyman, </em>397 U.S. 397, 420-23 (1970). Each complaint here alleged the State was out of compliance in some respect with applicable provisions of the governing statutes and regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-8\">The plaintiffs in Arbas v. Chang, Civil No. 49483, acting on their own behalf as well as for all other recipients of public assistance similarly situated, challenged the State\u2019s practice of regarding federal and state tax refunds as \u201cincome\u201d for AFDC purposes, a procedure which afforded a recipient the unenviable choice of a forfeiture to the State of all or part of the refunds or a reduction, suspension, or termination of AFDC benefits. The circuit court certified the plaintiff class,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and subsequently entered a partial sum<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>mary judgment against the State.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b363-4\">The named plaintiffs in Von Hiram v. Chang, Civil No. 50943, another class action,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> alleged the State was out of conformity with 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 602(a)(7) and related federal regulations because it did not permit recipients of assistance to deduct from income all expenses reasonably attributable to employment in determining eligibility for assistance payments under AFDC. They claimed <em>Shea v. Vialpando, supra, </em>had previously invalidated the State\u2019s practice of only allowing standardized deductions of $33 and $44 as work-related expenses. Thereafter, it was stipulated by the parties that the entry of a judgment in favor of the plaintiff class was appropriate, and the State was ordered to pay each member of the class the sum he or she would have received but for the State\u2019s adoption of the illegal procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-5\">In Montalvo v. Chang, Civil No. 52895, also a class suit,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> the representatives of the plaintiff class claimed that the State\u2019s refusal to consider child support payments payable to family units eligible for AFDC aid as unearned income for eligibility purposes and its further refusal to disregard the first $5 thereof in computing en<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>titlement to assistance were in violation of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 602(a)(28), related federal regulations, HRS Chapter 346, and related state regulations. Since a federal district court had previously ruled that the State had breached relevant federal statutory provisions and regulations in the foregoing respects,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> a stipulated judgment in favor of the plaintiff class was deemed appropriate in this case too..</p>\n<p id=\"b364-6\">Subsequent to the entry of the judgments, the circuit court awarded attorneys\u2019 fees to the attorneys representing the plaintiff classes. In each case, the fees were made payable from the common fund created by the terms of the judgment. In Montalvo v. Chang, the attorneys for the plaintiff class were awarded approximately fourteen percent of the amount recovered under the judgment as their fees; the attorneys for the plaintiff classes in Arbas v. Chang and Von Hiram v. Chang were allowed approximately twelve percent of the judgment amounts as fees.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The State appealed from the orders awarding fees in all three cases. And as similar issues are posed by the appeals, they were consolidated for argument and disposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-8\">We initially address the issue of the State\u2019s standing to appeal from the orders awarding attorneys\u2019 fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-9\">The State in the view of plaintiffs-appellees lacks requisite standing because it has not been \u201caggrieved\u201d by the orders. In a sense they are correct, for the sums allowed their attorneys as fees are payable from funds which are no longer within the State\u2019s control and the orders apparently imposed no further liability upon the State. Yet, we have not been inclined to treat appeal rights lightly; \u201cthe policy of this court has always been to permit litigants, where possible, to appeal and hear the case on its merits.\u2019\u2019Jones <em>v. Dieker, </em>39 Haw. 208, 209 (1952); <em>Jordan v. Hamada, </em>62 Haw. 444, 451, 616 P.2d 1368, 1373 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b365-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>HRS \u00a7 641-1 (a) provides that \u201c[a]ppeals shall be allowed in civil matters from all final judgments, orders, or decrees of circuit . . . courts ... to the supreme court, except as otherwise provided.\u201d As the State was party to the proceedings below and the orders in question are patently final, it appears to have more than a colorable right to appeal. But by judicial fiat a party bringing an appeal must have been \u201caggrieved\u201d by the trial court\u2019s final order, <em>In re Guardianship of Ward, </em>42 Haw. 60, 65 (1957); <em>Castle v. Irwin, </em>25 Haw. 786, 792 (1921); <em>Hawaiian Trust Co. v. Holt, </em>24 Haw. 212, 215 (1918), for questions capable of judicial resolution are best \u201cpresented in an adversary context.\u201d <em>Life of the Land v. Land Use Commission, </em>63 Haw. 166, 172, 623 P.2d 431, 438 (1981). And an \u201caggrieved party,\u201d we have held, is one who is affected or prejudiced by the appealable order. <em>In re Guardianship of Ward, supra; Castle v. Irwin, supra; Hawaiian Trust Co. v. Holt, supra. </em>The pertinent inquiry then is whether the State was \u201caggrieved\u201d in some way by the circuit court\u2019s orders awarding attorneys\u2019 fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-5\">The State concedes the orders appealed from, on their faces, do not subject it to further liability. It contends, however, that they represent potentials for loss of federal matching funds if allowed to stand.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> At this juncture we are not prepared to state the threat is nonexistent. \u201cWhen [federal] money is spent to promote the general welfare, the concept of welfare or the opposite is shaped by Congress, not the states.\u201d <em>Helvering v. Davis, </em>301 U.S. 619, 645 (1937). And disputes on \u201cwhether federal funds allocated to the States are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>being expended in consonance with the conditions that Congress has attached to their use\u201d are definitively settled by the Supreme Court. <em>Rosado v. Wyman, supra, </em>397 U.S. at 422-23.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-6\">We find the State is an \u201caggrieved party\u201d here since its interests may well be jeopardized if the fees in question were improper. A liberal application of HRS \u00a7 641-l(a) and our standing requirement in this instance is consistent with the policy \u201cto permit litigants, where possible to appeal<em>,\" Jones v. Dieker, supra, </em>39 Haw. at 209, and our prior decisions that have construed statutes and rules on appellate procedure liberally to uphold appeal rights. <em>See, e.g., Jordan v. Hamada, supra, </em>62 Haw. at 451, 616 P.2d at 1373; <em>Credit Associates of Maui v. Montilliano, </em>51 Haw. 325, 329, 460 P.2d 762, 765 (1969); <em>Madden v. Madden, </em>43 Haw. 148, 153 (1959).</p>\n<p id=\"b366-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-8\">Having disposed of the threshhold question raised by Plaintiffsappellees, we turn to the issues presented in the State\u2019s appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-9\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-10\">1.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-11\">Litigants for whom legal services have been rendered are generally expected \u201cto assume the burden of paying for those services,\u2019\u2019 and prevailing parties ordinarily are not awarded attorneys\u2019 fees \u201cin the absence of a statute, agreement or stipulation\u201d authorizing their allowance. <em>Yokochi v. Yoshimoto, </em>44 Haw. 297, 307, 353 P.2d 820, 826 (1960). There are no specific authorizations for fees in the instant situations. But courts have recognized \u201cexceptions to this general rule,\u201d and where the efforts \u201cof a member of a class have been instrumental in creating or preserving a fund to the benefit of the entire class,\u201d counsel fees have been allowed. <em>Id. </em>\u201cThe common fund doctrine provides that a private plaintiff, or his attorney, whose efforts create, discover, increase or preserve a fund to which others also have a claim is entitled to recover from the fund the costs of his litigation, including attorneys\u2019 fees.\u201d <em>Vincent v. Hughes Air West, Inc., </em>557 F.2d 759, 769 (9th Cir. 1977). <em>Cf. Alyeska Pipeline Service Co. v. Wilderness Society, </em>421 U.S. 240 (1975) (an organization acting to vindicate \u201cimportant statutory rights of all citizens\u201d was not per<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>mitted to recover its attorneys\u2019 fees from the defendant under the \u201cprivate attorney general\u201d approach).</p>\n<p id=\"b367-5\">The genesis of the \u201ccommon fund\u201d as a source of attorneys\u2019 fees may be traced to century-old landmark decisions of the Supreme Court. In the seminal case, <em>Trustees v. Greenough, </em>105 U.S. 527 (1881), a bondholder, on behalf of himself and other bondholders, pursued litigation to preserve the assets of a fund created to meet interest and sinking fund payments on bonds issued by a railroad company after the fund\u2019s trustees had wasted a portion thereof and failed to make the required payments. After eleven years of litigation at his own expense, he succeeded in recapturing some of the wasted assets and securing substantial payments to the bondholders, most of whom accepted the payments. While a residue of the restored trust fund was still under the control of the court, he submitted a claim for reimbursement of his attorneys\u2019 fees, which was allowed. The Supreme Court affirmed the allowance of fees, for in its view the complainant was entitled to recover a due portion of the expenses he had incurred from the other bondholders, and \u201ca charge upon the fund . . . [was] the most equitable way of securing such contribution.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 532.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-6\">The claim against the common fund for counsel fees in <em>Central Railroad &amp; Banking Co. v. Pettus, </em>113 U. S. 116 (1885), was not asserted by the litigant; it was made directly by his attorneys. The direct award of attorneys\u2019 fees and the allowance of a lien therefor upon the property brought under the trial court\u2019s control in the class action was affirmed by the Supreme Court. And the claim for fees recognized in <em>Greenough </em>was effectively transformed into an independent right of attorneys.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b367-7\">The Court subsequently expanded the concepts established by <em>Greenough </em>and <em>Pettus </em>beyond class actions in <em>Sprague v. Ticonic Na</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number><em>tional Bank, </em>307 U.S. 161, 166-67 (1939). By vindicating her rights to a trust, the plaintiff established similar rights in others. But she did not purport to represent them; nor was a common fund established in the traditional sense. Yet the Court found it was within the power of an equity court to award the plaintiff attorneys\u2019 fees payable from the trusts established for the benefit of the others.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b368-6\">2.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-7\">The State does not dispute the efficacy of the common fund doctrine in compensating attorneys whose services benefit the members of a class as well as their own clients in proper situations. But it maintains the common funds here were not under the control, constructive or otherwise, of the circuit court; for they consisted of assistance payments meant for AFDC recipients. HRS \u00a7 346-33, it claims, stands as an absolute barrier to the court\u2019s diversion of portions of the funds to attorneys for the plaintiff classes. Although a literal application of \u00a7 346-33 would support the State\u2019s position, we do not read the section to have such effect in the situations before us.</p>\n<p id=\"A9H\">The statutory provision at issue is found in that part of the Hawaii Revised Statutes covering the Department of Social Services and Housing and its functions. The chapter evinces a general pur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>pose to further the social welfare, and a particular provision, HRS \u00a7 346-14, mandates State cooperation with the federal government \u201cin carrying out the purposes of the Social Security Act, and in other matters of mutual concern pertaining to public welfare, public assistance, and child welfare services.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> That AFDC is a program established by the Social Security Act has been noted, as has its primary purpose to aid \u201cneedy dependent children and the parents or relatives who live with and care for them.\u201d <em>Shea v. Vialpando, supra, </em>416 U.S. at 253.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-5\">HRS \u00a7 346-33 provides in broad terms that assistance payments are inalienable; its obvious intent is to prevent a diminution, disposal, or divestiture of public assistance payments prior to their receipt by intended recipients. Strictly construed, it clearly precludes the allowance of attorneys\u2019 fees from common funds consisting of AFDC benefits. But to read it as prohibiting awards of fees here would hardly be consonant with its purpose of ensuring that public assistance payments reach recipients in amounts specified by law.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-6\">The existence of the common funds and the right of AFDC recipients to share in the proceeds of the class actions are attributable to the attorneys for the plaintiff classes. Without the lawyers\u2019 efforts, class members would not have received benefits in legally prescribed amounts. The work of the attorneys thus served a purpose entirely consistent with the policies and purposes of the Social Security Act and HRS Chapter 346. It would be illogical to apply a provision in the latter which is designed to prevent the diminution of assistance payments to impede the receipt of fees earned by attorneys responsible for the enhancement of assistance payments. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>Where the letter of the law has produced a harsh result contrary to its intendment, we have not hesitated to eschew a strict reading and to seek meaning from its policy. <em>Hawaii Carpenters\u2019 Trust Funds v. Aloe Development Corp., </em>63 Haw. 566, 574, 633 P.2d 1106, 1111 (1981). For the Supreme Court teaches us:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-6\">The policy as well as the letter of the law is a guide to decision. Resort to the policy of a law may be had to ameliorate its seeming harshness or to qualify its apparent absolutes as <em>Holy Trinity Church v. United States, </em>143 U.S. 457 illustrates. The process of interpretation also misses its high function if a strict reading of a law results in the emasculation or deletion of a provision which a less literal reading would preserve.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b370-7\"><em>Markham v. Cabell, </em>326 U.S. 404, 409 (1945).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Finding a \u201cless literal reading\u201d would serve the purpose and policy of the law, we do not read HRS \u00a7 346-33 as inhibiting the award of fees from common funds consisting of AFDC benefits in the situations at hand. And as the permissible use of class actions, formerly limited to suits in equity, has been extended to all civil litigation in the circuit courts by Rule 23 of the Hawaii Rules of Civil Procedure, <em>Life of the Land v. Land Use Commission, supra, </em>63 Haw. at 179, 623 P.2d at 442, the circuit court undoubtedly was vested with power to allow the fees. Thus we proceed to the question on the sums allowed.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-8\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-9\">1.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-10\">We formally acknowledged the class action\u2019s vast potential for lending speed and efficiency to the administration of justice when its use in all civil litigation in the circuit courts was authorized. But we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>recently issued a caveat that one of the latchkeys to its actual use was fairness to absentee class members. <em>Id. </em>Fairness to the class must be watchwords in a subsequent award of counsel fees too, for the class action\u2019s capacity to promote justice \u201cis attended with equally great potential of unreasonable charges for attorneys\u2019 fees and expenses and of improper solicitation of legal representation.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> <em>Manual for Complex Litigation </em>65 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b371-5\">The total sum in the common fund in Montalvo v. Chang was approximately $103,000. Claiming more than ninety hours of work had been performed on behalf of the plaintiff class, its attorneys sought a fee award amounting to fifteen percent of the fund. They were allowed fourteen and two-tenths percent of the recovery in fees and costs, both accrued and anticipated. The costs, however, constituted a minor portion of the awarded sum. The lawyers for the plaintiff classes in Arbas v. Chang and Von Hiram v. Chang claimed one hundred seventy-eight and one-half hours had been spent on behalf of class members and requested twenty percent of common funds totalling approximately $184,000 for their services. The circuit court allowed them twelve and one-tenth percent of the recovered sums as their fees.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> What was reasonable and fair in the co\u00fart\u2019s opinion was established in all cases without evidentiary hearings. Moreover, the actual basis therefor is not articulated, and we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>are unable to engage in a meaningful review of fairness.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-6\">We assume for present purposes that the court followed the general guidelines for determining reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees set forth in <em>Sharp v. Hui Wahine, Inc., </em>49 Haw. 241, 244-45, 413 P.2d 242, 245-46, <em>rehearing denied, </em>49 Haw. 257, 414 P.2d 82 (1966). Yet these guides in our opinion, were not precise enough for the particular determinations. Rule 23, H.R.C.P., compels the circuit court to assume the role of a \u201cprotector of the rights of absent class members,\u201d <em>Manual for Complex Litigation, supra, </em>at 61,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> an d demands more stringent standards.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-7\">Our views in this regard are far from unique, for courts dealing with the problem have characteristically adopted exacting, though not necessarily similar, standards to govern the allowance of fees. <em>See Manual for Complex Litigation, supra, </em>at 66-68; 3 H. Newberg, <em>Class Actions </em>\u00a7\u00a7 6920-22c, at 1132-43 (1977). Among the noteworthy endeavors to infuse a desired fairness into the relevant awards have been the efforts of the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-8\">In <em>Lindy Bros. Builders v. American Radiator &amp; Standard Sanitary Corp., </em>487 F.2d 161 (3d Cir. 1973) (\u201cLindy I\u201d), a multi-district antitrust class suit, the appellate court vacated fee orders which had been entered without evidentiary hearings, purportedly on the trial court\u2019s consideration of four factors: \u201cthe percentage of a claimant\u2019s recovery awarded as attorneys\u2019 fees in other cases, the amount of the recovery from which fees were being awarded, the amount the attorneys received from their clients under private agreements, and the time spent... \u2018in connection with this litigation.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 166. The Court of Appeals found \u201c[t]he mere listing of four factors for consideration . . . makes meaningful review difficult and gives little guidance to attorneys and claimants,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 166-67, and then detailed its four-step process for ensuring fair and reasonable fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-9\">The procedure described in \u201cLindy I\u201d commences with the trial court\u2019s ascertainment of the actual services rendered to the class. In essence, the initial inquiry is \u201chow many hours were spent in what <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>manner by which attorneys.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 167. The determination of time spent in performing services \u201cwithin appropriately specific categories,\u201d <em>id., </em>is followed by an estimate of its worth. \u201cThe value of an attorney\u2019s time generally is reflected in his normal billing rate.\u201d <em>Id. </em>But it may be \u201cnecessary to use several different rates for the different attorneys\u201d and the reasonable rate of compensation may differ \u201cfor different activities.\u201d <em>Id. </em>And when the hourly rate reached through the foregoing analysis is applied to the actual hours worked, a \u201creasonably objective basis for valuing an attorney\u2019s services\u201d is derived. <em>Id. </em>The inquiry, however, does not end here, for other factors must be considered. The product of the first and second steps nevertheless serves as the \u201clodestar\u201d of the ultimate fee award. <em>Id. </em>at 168.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">The first of the factors to be considered for possible adjustment of the \u201clodestar\u201d determination is \u201cthe contingent nature of success,\u201d a factor which may be of special significance where \u201cthe attorney has no private agreement that guarantees payment even if no recovery is obtained.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The second additional factor to be examined \u201cis the extent, if any, to which the quality of an attorney\u2019s work mandates increasing or decreasing\u201d the \u201clodestar\u201d figure. <em>Id. </em>If the court decides an adjustment is justified on this basis, it \u201cshould set forth as specifically as possible the facts that support. . . [its] conclusion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 169.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-6\">The phase covering the examination of possible adjustment factors was subsequently refined through amplification in <em>Lindy Bros. Builders v.

In discussing \u201cthe contingent nature of success\u201d in the latter, the Court of Appeals said \u201cthe . . .

We are convinced from a review of the case law in the realm of our concern that this wide acceptance is justified; the prototype offered by \u201cLindy I\u201d and \u201cLindy II\u201d remains among the more rational and comprehensive computational modes devised thus far. We are mindful that the \u201cLindy\u201d standards have been criticized as overly rigid by those who are still partial to the more traditional and flexible approach of the Court of Appeals of the Second Circuit in <em>Alpine Pharmacy, Inc. v.

Plainly the foundation for the historic practice of granting reimbursement for the costs of litigation other than the conventional taxable costs is part of the original authority of the chancellor to do equity in a particular situation. Whether one professes to sue representatively or formally makes a fund available for others may, of course, be a relevant circumstance in making the fund liable for his costs in producing it. But when such a fund is for all practical purposes created for the benefit of others, the formalities of the litigation \u2014 the abrence of an avowed class suit or the creation of a fund, as it were, through <em>stare decisis </em>rather than through a decree \u2014 hardly touch the power of equity in doing justice as between a party and the beneficiaries of his litigation.
