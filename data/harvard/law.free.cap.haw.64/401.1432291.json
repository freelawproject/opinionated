(Hawaiian Scenic), a joint tort-feasor with Defendant-appellant City and County of Honolulu (the City).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We conclude the court below was correct in permitting recovery against the City, despite findings by the trial jury that Wesley Wai Leong Wong\u2019s negligence was a causative factor in the fatal mishap and his share of the fault exceeded the City\u2019s. For in the aggregate, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>the negligence of the City and Hawaiian Scenic was greater than that of the decedent.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-6\">The wrongful death action brought by Randolph W. T. Wong as administrator of the decedent\u2019s estate and by Richard J. H. Wong and Elsie K. A. Wong on behalf of themselves as parents of the decedent averred that the negligent operation of the school bus and the City\u2019s faulty adjustment and utilization of a traffic control device were responsible for Wesley Wai Leong Wong\u2019s death. The putative joint tort-feasors denied allegations of wrongdoing on their part and alleged the decedent\u2019s own negligence led to his death. The City further averred that if other negligent conduct was implicated, the bus company\u2019s negligence was the active and primary cause of the fatal accident. Plaintiffs-appellees, however, settled their claims against Hawaiian Scenic and proceeded to trial against the City alone.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-7\">At the close of trial before a jury, a special verdict premised on interrogatories propounded by the court was returned. The jury, <em>inter alia, </em>found the fatal event was brought on by the combined fault of the City, Hawaiian Scenic, and the decedent. It further ascribed six percent of the culpable negligence to the City, eighty percent to Hawaiian Scenic, and fourteen percent to the decedent. And its evaluation of the total damages accruing to plaintiffs-appellees amounted to $260,800, of which $100,000 was allocated to the decedent\u2019s estate, and $160,800 to his parents. The City\u2019s post-trial efforts to have judgment entered in its favor despite the jury\u2019s verdict were overruled, and a judgment reflecting the foregoing findings was entered by the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-8\">The City\u2019s principal thesis on appeal is that the clear, plain, and unambiguous provisions of the pertinent statute precluded the entry of judgment against a tort-feasor whose negligence was not as great as that of the decedent.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-9\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-10\">A legislative perception of unfairness in the common law doctrine of contributory negligence led to the passage of our modified <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>comparative negligence statute in 1969.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Although the measure served to ameliorate the harshness of an aspect of the common law by permitting the recovery of tort damages by a plaintiff whose negligence was not as great as the defendant\u2019s, it did not deal specifically with a significant problem \u2014 how comparison of negligence should be effected in a situation where there were multiple defendants, each responsible in part for the injury.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The City urges us to follow the judicially adopted Wisconsin rule and compare the decedent\u2019s negligence with that of each defendant on an individual basis.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Plaintiffs-appellees argue we should measure the decedent\u2019s negligence against the aggregate negligence of the defendants as the courts of Arkansas and Massachusetts have done.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b418-6\">The City maintains our comparative negligence statute was derived from Wisconsin and we are thus obliged to follow the prior construction of the pertinent language by its highest court. We are reminded \u201c[i]t is elementary that the adoption by the . . . legislature ... of a statute of another jurisdiction carries with it the judicial interpretation of the statute by that jurisdiction. <em>(Territory v. Ota, </em>36 Haw. 80; <em>Carter v. Gear, </em>16 Haw. 242, <em>aff'd </em>197 U.S. 348.)\u201d <em>In re Sawyer, </em>41 Haw. 270, 273 (1956). We do <em>not </em>doubt the pioneering <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>Wisconsin legislation served as the prototype for the Hawaii law;<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> nor do we denigrate the value of the foregoing canon of statutory construction in an appropriate setting. Still, we cannot accept the interpretation of the Wisconsin law inasmuch as there are clear indications that our legislature adopted the statutory language but not the judicial gloss.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark>.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-5\">The legislative modification of the doctrine of contributory negligence in 1969 sought to temper a phase of the common law deemed inconsistent with contemporary notions of fairness. Its purpose was to allow one partly at fault in an accident resulting in injury to be recompensed for the damages attributable to the fault of another if the former\u2019s negligence was not the primary cause of the accident. But the Wisconsin statute as interpreted by the highest court of that state effectively forecloses a plaintiffs recovery of the full measure of damages ascribable to the negligence of others in some situations where his negligence is not the major causative factor.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Hence, the judicial treatment of the Wisconsin statute is \u201cnot in harmony with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>the spirit or policy of the laws\u201d of Hawaii, and we reject it as a guide to interpretation. <em>See </em>note 7 <em>supra. </em>Moreover, we note that serious misgivings about the relevant construction have been registered by the Wisconsin court itself.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<attorneys id=\"AZh\"><em>Arthur Ripley, Jr. (Edmund L.

Skelley Oil Co., 83 Wis.2d 30, 264 N.W.2d 574 (1978), the court recorded a dissatisfaction with its own interpretation in these terms:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b420-11\">This case is one of many cases which have come before this court involving multiple party tortfeasors. May urges the court to re-examine its interpretation of the comparative negligence statute. The majority of the court has become convinced that comparing the negligence of the individual plaintiff to that of each individual tortfeasor \u2014 rather than comparing the negligence of the individual plaintiff to that of the combined negligence of the several tortfeasors who have collectively contributed to plaintiffs injuries \u2014 leads to harsh and unfair results; the majority has further concluded that this rule of comparative negligence, a court-made doctrine, can be changed by court decision. However, in view of our holding that Indian Head is not negligent, the majority does not believe that the case at bar is the appropriate one in which to structure a change in the rule of comparative negligence in cases involving multiple defendants.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b420-12\">83 Wis. 2d at 38-39, 264 N.W.2d at 578. But several members of the majority subsequently recanted, and a rule that \u201cleads to harsh and unfair results\" remains in effect. See Reiter v.
