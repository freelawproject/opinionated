In connection with the development, Defendant-Appellant Hawaii Escrow and Title, Inc. (hereinafter cited as appellant), contacted appellee\u2019s president, Warren Ho, hoping to secure appellee\u2019s business. Appellant submitted three pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>pos\u00e1is for appellee\u2019s consideration. The first provided for a standard rate of $6,799 for an ALTA construction loan title insurance policy<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> in the amount of $3,100,000.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The second provided for a straight discount of 60% off the standard rate. The third provided for an up-front charge of 110% of the standard rate and a credit upon the closing of the individual unit sales, of a prorated amount of 100% of the standard rate; appellee would, in effect, obtain its construction loan title insurance policy for 10% of the standard rate under the third proposal, the one which appellee eventually chose.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-5\">Appellant confirmed the agreement reached between appellee and itself in a letter dated November 20, 1973, which provided in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b653-6\">Pursuant to our verbal conversation of November 19, 1973, this is to confirm our Title Insurance fees.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b653-7\">For and in consideration of a cash advance of $7,498.90 (which represents 110% of the standard rate), payable within 30 days from the issuance of our ALT A Construction Loan Policy of $3,100,000. Our premium charge is $724.90, the balance of $6,774 owing you will be payable upon the closing of all the individual escrows for Aiea Lani Estates. This will reflect as a credit of $ 112.90 on the Sellers Closing Statement. In short,.your cost is $724.90 for the ALTA policy.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b653-8\">In addition, the letter provided that appellant would also be furnishing the buyers of the individual units with ALTA title insurance policies covering the separate units for which each buyer would be charged $175 per unit. Each buyer would also be responsible for an escrow fee of $75; appellant waived the escrow fee of $75 which was chargeable to appellee.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-9\">Pursuant to the agreement, appellee paid appellant $7,499.40<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> on or about October 11, 1974.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>In approximately May or June of 1975, prior to the closing of any of the units, appellant became aware of the passage of the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Actof 1974 (Pub. L. 93-533), 12 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2601 <em>\u00e9t. seq. </em>(hereinafter cited as RESPA) which was to be effective as of June 20, 1975.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>'</p>\n<p id=\"b654-6\">RESPA provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b654-7\">\u00a7 2607. Prohibition against kickbacks and unearned fees.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b654-8\">\n<em>Business Referrals</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b654-9\">(a) No person shall give and no person shall accept any fee, kickback, or thing of value pursuant to any agreement or understanding, oral or otherwise, that business incident to or a part of a real estate settlement service involving a federally related mortgage loan shall be referred to any person.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b654-10\">\n<em>Splitting Charges</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b654-11\">(b) No person shall give and no person shall accept any portion, split, or percentage of any charge made or received for the rendering of a real estate settlement service in connection with a transaction involving a federally related mortgage loan other than for services actually performed.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"AWq\">Believing that RESPA made the reimbursement to appellee illegal, appellant\u2019s representative testified that appellant immediately informed Warren Ho, appellee\u2019s president, of the situation. Mr. Ho, however, testified that he was not made aware of the possible applicability of RESPA until he made demand on appellee for the $6,774 after the closing of all the units. The trial court found Mr. Ho\u2019s testimony more credible.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-12\">Appellee sold forty-seven of the sixty units to individual purchasers.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Due to financial problems, appellee was unable to sell the remaining thirteen units and by agreement conveyed them, in August 1977, to the lending institution that provided appellee with its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"641\">*641</page-number>construction loan; the trial court ruled that the conveyance qualified as a closing of the units involved, as contemplated by the parties\u2019 agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-5\">The trial court found that RESPA was not applicable to the transaction in the instant case and, thus, ruled that the contract was enforceable as contracted and appellant was required to reimburse $6,774 to appellee plus attorney fees pursuant to Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) \u00a7 607-14. For reasons discussed below, we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-6\">The issues before this court on appeal are whether the trial court erred in finding RESPA inapplicable, and if RESPA is applicable, what effect it has on the transaction herein.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-7\">The applicable standard in reviewing the trial court\u2019s findings of fact is set forth in Hawaii Rules of Civil Procedure (HRCP) Rule 52(a) which provides that \u201c[findings of fact shall not be set aside unless clearly erroneous, and due regard shall be given to the opportunity of the trial court to judge the credibility of the witnesses.\" A finding is clearly erroneous when the court is left with a \u201cfirm and definite conviction that a mistake has been committed.\u201d <em>Miller v. Leadership Housing Systems, Inc., </em>57 Haw. 321, 326, 555 P.2d 864, 868 (1976). <em>Honda v. Higa, </em>52 Haw. 311, 474 P.2d 708 (1970); <em>Ed Klein, Inc. v. Hotel Kaimana, Inc., </em>51 Haw. 268, 457 P.2d 210 (1969); <em>Peine v. Murphy, </em>46 Haw. 233, 377 P.2d 708 (1962). In applying this standard to the instant case, we believe that the lower court erred in finding RESPA inapplicable to the transaction involved in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-8\">RESPA was enacted on December 22, 1974, as a remedial measure when Congress found that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b655-9\">significant reforms in the real estate settlement process [were] needed to insure that consumers throughout the Nation are provided with greater and more timely information on the nature and costs of the settlement process and are protected from unnecessarily high settlement charges caused by certain abusive practices that have developed in some areas of the country.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b655-10\">12 U.S.C. \u00a7 2601(a). One of the stated purposes of the Real Estate Settlement Procedure Chapter was to effect changes in the settlement process for residential real estate that would result \u201cin the elimination of kickbacks or referral fees that tend to increase unnecessarily the costs of certain settlement services.\u201d This objective is to be effectuated through 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 2607 \u2014 Prohibition Against <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number>Kickbacks and Unearned Fees. The Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, authorized to prescribe rules and regulations and make interpretations as necessary to achieve the purposes of the chapter, formulated Regulation X which interpretes the provisions of RESPA. Thus, we have to look to Regulation X as well as the Act in determining whether RESPA is applicable to the transaction before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-6\">Initially, we note that the prohibitions in 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 2607 are triggered when a transaction involves both real estate \u201csettlement services\u201d <em>and </em>\u201ca federally related mortgage loan.\u201d The term \u201csettlement services\u201d as defined \u201cincludes any services provided in connection with a real estate settlement including, but not limited to, the following: title searches, title examinations, the provision of title certificates, <em>title insurance . . . and the handling of the processing, and closing or settlement.\u201d </em>12 U.S.C. \u00a7 2602(3) (emphasis added). There is no question that the transaction between appellant and appellee involved settlement services by definition; appellant was to provide appellee and the individual buyers with title insurance and was to process the individual closings.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-7\">There is question, however, as to whether a \u201cfederally related mortgage loan\u201d as defined by 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 2602(1) was involved.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Akc\">(1) the term \u201cfederally related mortgage loan\u201d includes any loan (other than temporary financing such as a construction loan) which \u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b656-8\">(A) is secured by a first lien on residential real property (including individual units of condominiums and cooperatives) designed principally for the occupancy of from one to four families; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b656-9\">(B)(i) is made in whole or in part by any lender the deposits or accounts of which are insured by any agency of the Federal Government, or.is made in whole or in part by any lender which is regulated by any agency of the Federal Government;</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b656-10\">While the construction loan which appellee procured for the development is specifically exempt from the impact of RESPA,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number>loans which the individual buyers obtained to finance the purchase of their separate units qualify as federally related mortgage loans.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-5\">Regulation X clarifies \u00a7 2602(1) by setting forth four requirements which must be met for a loan to be considered a federally related mortgage loan; it provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b657-6\">(1)The proceeds of the loan are used in whole or in part to finance the purchase by the borrower, or other transfer of legal title of the Mortgaged Property ....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b657-7\">(2)The loan is secured by a first lien or other first security interest covering real estate,. . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b657-8\">(v) which is a condominium unit (or a first lien covering a cooperative unit) designed principally for the occupancy of from 1 to 4 families;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b657-9\">(3) The Mortgaged Property is located in a State; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b657-10\">(4) The loan: (i) Is made by <em>a Lender meeting the requirements of paragraph (c) </em>below,....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b657-11\">24 C.F.R. \u00a7 3500.5(b) (emphasis added). Paragraph \u201cc\u201d provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b657-12\">A Lender is within paragraph (b) (4) (i) if it is:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b657-13\">(1) A lending institution the deposits or accounts of which are insured by the Federal Savings and Loan Corporation (FSLIC), the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) or any other agency of the Federal Government.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b657-14\">24 C.F.R. \u00a7 3500.5(c). There was sufficient evidence in the record from which to determine that the majority of buyers did in fact go to qualifying lenders to secure financing to purchase their condominium unit.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-15\">According to Mr. Ho, appellee\u2019s president, both the construction loan and the individual loans were obtained through Liberty Bank.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A42\">A. Well, I think the make up was that San Francisco Ureka Financial had funded the loan and Liberty Bank would administer the loan.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b657-16\">Q. O.k. And which loan would this \u2014 was this the construction loan?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b657-17\">A. This was both the construction loan and the individual loans to the individual purchasers.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b657-18\">Q. O.k. And it was your understanding that Ureka Federal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number>Savings and Loan was the person that put up the money and Liberty Bank was more or less administering the funds?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b658-6\">A. That\u2019s correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b658-7\">Q. And Ureka Federal put up funds not only on the construcdon loan but put up funds for the individual mortgages of those people who financed through Liberty Bank, right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b658-8\">A. That\u2019s right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b658-9\">Mr. Salvatore Fanciullo, appellant\u2019s vice-president, testified that <em>most </em>of the individual buyers were financed either by Loyalty Mortgage Company or Liberty Bank.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b658-10\">Q. One other question. Would you be able to tell the court where the individual sales or correction \u2014 strike that. Would you be able to tell the court who financed the individual sales of the buyers?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b658-11\">A. Most of them, I can, yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b658-12\">Q. What would those be?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b658-13\">A. They were either between Loyalty Mortgage Company, Loyalty and or Liberty Bank, from my recollection.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b658-14\">While it is not clear from the testimony whether the individual purchasers obtained financing solely from Liberty Bank or from both Liberty Bank and Loyalty Mortgage Company, what is relevant to the issue of the applicability of RESPA is whether the lending institutions were insured by the Federal Government. Mr. Fanciullo testified that both institutions were so insured.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b658-15\">Q. All right. Do you know if either of those two outfits are insured by the Federal Government?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b658-16\">A. Yes, they are.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b658-17\">In fact, the lower court took judicial notice that Liberty Bank\u2019s funds were federally insured.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b658-18\">MR. GOULD: Federally insured funds that the bank \u2014 and the testimony uncorroborated that Liberty Bank is federally \u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b658-19\">THE COURT: There\u2019s no question about that. The court takes judicial notice \u2014 knowledge of that.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b658-20\">From the preceding, it is apparent that the loans obtained by the individual purchasers fall within the definition of federally related mortgage loans and thus are subject to RESPA. However, appellee contends that the only loan involved in the transaction between appellee and appellant was the construction loan for which appellant was to provide an ALTA title insurance policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number>W7e disagree. RESPA prohibits any person from accepting or giving anything of value in consideration for referral of settlement service business \u201cinvolving\u201d a federally related mortgage loan. The term \u201cinvolving\u201d is a broad term which \u201cpossesses connotations such as \u2018implying,\u2019 \u2018including,\u2019 \u2018relating to,\u2019 \u2018growing out of,\u2019 \u2018[necessitat_ing] as a result or legal consequence.\u2019 \u201d <em>Taub v. Bowles, </em>149 F.2d 817 (Emer. Ct. App. 1945). <em>Feil v. Federal Trade Commission, </em>285 F.2d 879 (9th Cir. 1960).</p>\n<p id=\"b659-5\">The record is replete with uncontroverted evidence that the agreement whereby appellant was to provide escrow services and title insurance policies to both appellee and the individual buyers was a package deal. As such, the federally related mortgage loans obtained by the individual buyers were involved in the transaction. Therefore, we hold that the trial court erred in finding that the transaction herein was not subject to RESPA.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-6\">Appellee further argues that even if RESPA is applicable, the reimbursement provision under the agreement does not violate RESPA\u2019s prohibition against kickbacks since appellee would not be receiving a fee, kickback, or thing of value<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> for <em>referring </em>settlement service business to appellant. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-7\">Again, the evidence is uncontroverted that appellant was to provide both the title insurance policy for the construction loan and the title insurance policies for the individual units. According to the testimony of appellee\u2019s witness, the insurance policies for the construction loan and for the individual units are separate and distinct; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number>the former required by the developer\u2019s lender and the latter required by the individuals\u2019 lenders.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b660-6\">The fact that appellant was to provide the policies for the individual units was mentioned in appellant\u2019s confirmation letter of November 20, 1973, wherein appellant wrote, \u201cIn connection with the premium charge for the ALTA policy covering the <em>individual units, </em>our fee will be $175 per unit.\u201d (Appellee\u2019s Exhibit 3) (Emphasis added). It was referred to again in appellant\u2019s letter of March 25, 1974: \u201cWe have discussed this with Mr. Marn and have no objection to cancelling the referenced Escrow Agreement provided we are still engaged for the purpose of issuing the <em>individual ALTA policies, </em>and the ALTA Construction Loan Policy in the amount of 3.1 million.\u201d (Appellee\u2019s Exhibit 5) (Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b660-7\">Although appellee may not have specifically stated that it would refer individual buyers to appellant for the purpose of obtaining title insurance for their individual units, this is clearly what was envisioned by the parties. Therefore, we hold that the trial court erred in finding that the reimbursement to appellee was not conditioned upon any agreement to refer business to appellant. The agreement between the parties in the instant case is similar to an example provided in 24 C.F.R. \u00a7 3500, App. B, illustrating situations which violate RESPA.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b660-8\">Facts. A, a provider of settlement services, provides settlement services <em>at abnormally low rates </em>or at no charge at all to B, a builder, in connection with a subdivision being developed by B. B agrees to refer purchasers of the completed homes in the subdivision to A for the purchase of settlement services in connection with the sale of individual lots of B.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b660-9\">Comments. The rendering of services by A to B at little or no charge constitutes a thing of value given by A to B in return for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>the referral of settlement business and both A and B are in violation of Section 8 of RESPA. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<attorneys id=\"AThU\"><em>Benjamin L. Carroll, III, </em>for defendant-appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"Ala\"><em>Gary Lee (Dale W. Lee </em>on the brief), <em>Ukishima &amp; Matsubara </em>of counsel, for plaintiff-appellee.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b661-5\">The agreement to reimburse appellee is subject to and illegal under RESPA. Thus, the contractual promise to reimburse was rendered impossible to perform by law. \u201cAs a general rule, a contractual duty is excused when government regulations make performance impossible.\u201d <em>R.C.
