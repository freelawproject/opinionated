The first order suppressed incriminating statements made by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>the defendant <em>because Miranda</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>warnings were not given defendant during his interrogation by the police. The other order dismissed the indictment against defendant because HRS \u00a7 291C-14 (1976), which requires motorists involved in accidents to furnish information, violates the defendant\u2019s constitutional guarantee against compulsory self-incrimination.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b494-6\">For the reasons set forth below, we affirm in part and reverse in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-7\">On June 13, 1979, ajogger was struck by a pickup truck. Shortly after the incident, an eyewitness to the accident gave a police officer the license number of the truck, the number of occupants, and a description of the vehicle. Another eyewitness also gave the officer the license number.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-8\">The officer radioed in the license number to the police station and received the address and name of the registered owner of the vehicle. The vehicle was registered to defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-9\">The officer then proceeded to defendant\u2019s address and another officer joined him there. A truck driven by defendant with a male occupant arrived. The vehicle matched the description given by the witnesses. At the officer\u2019s request, defendant came out of the truck and produced his driver\u2019s license. The officer asked defendant if he had hit anyone with his car, and defendant answered in the affirmative. The officer then asked him why he ran away, and defendant responded that he got angry when he saw the jogger and \u201cwent for him.\u201d Both questions were asked before <em>Miranda' </em>warnings were given.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-10\">. On January 15, 1980, defendant was indicted for failing to give information and render assistance in violation of HRS \u00a7\u00a7 291C-12, 291C-14.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-11\">Defendant filed a motion to suppress his statements made in response to the officer\u2019s two questions and a motion to dismiss indictment. The trial court granted both motions, ruling that <em>Miranda </em>warnings were required before the officer could question defendant and that HRS \u00a7 291C-14 violated defendant\u2019s privilege against self-incrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>I.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-5\">An individual in police custody may not be subjected to interrogation without first being advised of his <em>Miranda </em>rights. <em>State v. Paterson, </em>59 Haw. 357, 358-59, 581 P.2d 752, 753 (1978); <em>State v. Kalai, </em>56 Haw. 366, 368, 537 P.2d 8, 11 (1975). Custodial interrogation was defined by the Supreme Court in <em>Miranda v. Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436, 444 (1966), as \u201cquestioning initiated by law enforcement officers after a person has been taken into custody or otherwise deprived of his freedom of action in any significant way.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b495-6\">Since defendant was \u201cinterrogated\u201d within the meaning of <em>Miranda,</em><footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the determinative issue is whether defendant was in custody or otherwise deprived of his freedom of action in any significant way. This determination is to be made by objectively appraising the totality of the circumstances. <em>State v. Sugimoto, </em>62 Haw. 259, 265, 614 P.2d 386, 391 (1980); <em>State v. Patterson, supra </em>at 361, 581 P.2d at 755. These include the place and time of the interrogation, the length of the interrogation, the nature of the questions asked, the conduct of the police, and all other relevant circumstances. <em>State v. Sugimoto, supra </em>at 265, 614 P.2d at 391; <em>State v. Patterson, supra </em>at 361, 581 P.2d at 755. Among the relevant circumstances to be considered are whether the investigation has focused on the suspect and whether the police have probable cause to arrest him prior to questioning. While focus of the investigation upon the defendant, standing alone, will not trigger the application of the <em>Miranda </em>rule, it is an important factor in determining whether the defendant was subjected to custodial interrogation. <em>State v. Patterson, supra </em>at 361, 581 P.2d at 755; <em>State v. Kalai, supra </em>at 369, 537 P.2d at 11. Probable cause to arrest is also not determinative, but it may play a significant role in the application of the <em>Miranda </em>rule. <em>State v. Patterson, supra </em>at 361, 581 P.2d at 755; <em>People v. Diego, </em>121 Cal. App.3d 777, 175 Cal. Rptr. 553, 555-56 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b495-7\">We note that application of the <em>Miranda </em>rule is limited. It does not preclude the police, in the exercise of their investigatory duties <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>or functions, from making general on-the-scene inquiries as to facts surrounding a crime or other general questions in the fact-finding process. <em>State v. Patterson, supra </em>at 361-62, 581 P.2d at 755. In <em>State v. Patterson, supra, </em>we approved of the California Supreme Court\u2019s delineation in <em>People v. Manis, </em>268 Cal. App.2d 653,74 Cal. Rptr. 423 (1969), of the outer parameters beyond which on-the-scene interviews may not proceed without <em>Miranda </em>warnings. In <em>Manis </em>the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b496-6\">[P]ersons temporarily detained for brief questioning by police officers who lack probable cause to make an arrest or bring an accusation need not be warned about incrimination and their right to counsel, until such time as the point of arrest or accusation has been reached or the questioning has ceased to be brief and casual and become sustained and coercive (footnote, omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b496-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 669, 74 Cal. Rptr. at 433.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-8\">In the instant case, the officer knew that the jogger had been struck by a pickup truck with two occupants and also knew the vehicle\u2019s license number and its description. After obtaining the name and address of defendant, who was the vehicle\u2019s registered owner, the officer proceeded t\u00f3 defendant\u2019s address, and he waited for the defendant. Upon defendant\u2019s arrival, the officer noticed that the truck met the description given to him and was occupied by two persons. On the basis of the officer\u2019s knowledge and observation, we conclude that the investigation had focused upon the defendant; and that, after defendant admitted his participation in the accident, the police had probable cause to arrest.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b496-9\">Inasmuch as the totality of circumstances created tHe kind of coercive atmosphere that <em>Miranda </em>warnings were designed to prevent, custody attached and <em>Miranda </em>warnings were required. Based upon our analysis, the defendant\u2019s answer to the first question was admissible while his answer to the second was not.</p>\n<p id=\"A-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>II.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-4\">We now turn to the State\u2019s assertion that the trial court erred in dismissing the indictment on the grounds that HRS \u00a7 291C-14<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> violated defendant\u2019s privilege against compulsory self-incrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-5\">In <em>California v. Byers, </em>402 U.S. 424 (1971), the Supreme Court rejected a similar challenge to a \u201chit-and-run\u201d statute brought under the fifth amendment to the United States Constitution. The rationale of the decision was twofold. First, the privilege may be invoked only where the compelled disclosures will confront the claimant with \u201csubstantial hazards of self-incrimination.\u201d The court found this requirement lacking because the purpose of the California statute was noncriminal, the statute was directed at all drivers in California, and the disclosures with respect to automobile accidents did not involve a sufficiently substantial risk of self-incrimination. Second, the behavior prescribed by the statute was not testimonial in the fifth amendment sense.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-6\">State courts have also upheld the validity of \u201chit-and-run\u201d statutes against claims of self-incrimination. <em>See People v. Samuel, </em>29 N.Y.2d 252, 327 N.Y.S.2d 321, 277 N.E.2d 381 (1971); State v. <em>Smyth, </em>_R.I_, 397 A.2d 497 <em>(1979); Banks v. Commonwealth, </em>217 Va. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>527, 230 S.E.2d 256 (1976); <em>State v. Engstrom, </em>79 Wash.2d 469, 487 P.2d 205 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b498-6\">HRS \u00a7 291-C-14, like the statute examined <em>in Byers, </em>does not confront individuals with \u201csubstantial hazards of self-incrimination.\u201d The statute is essentially regulatory and not criminal,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> it is directed at all drivers in Hawaii, an'\u00dc disclosures with respect to automobile accidents do not entail a substantial risk of self-incrimination.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b498-7\">In addition, disclosure of the driver\u2019s name, address, and the vehicle\u2019s registration number does not constitute self-incriminating testimony. <em>California v. Byers, supra </em>at 431-34.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-8\">Defendant cites <em>Marchetti v. United States, </em>390 U.S. 39 (1968); <em>Albertson v. SACB, </em>382 U.S. 70 (1965); <em>Grosso v. United States, </em>390 U.S. 62 (1968); and <em>Haynes v. United States, </em>390 U.S. 85 (1968) in support of his position.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-9\">As the court found in <em>Byers, </em>these cases are inapposite to a case involving a \u201chit-and-run\u201d statute because,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b498-10\">[i]n all of these cases the disclosures condemned were only those extracted from a \u201chighly selective group inherently suspect of Criminal activities\u201d and the privilege was applied only in \u201can area permeated with criminal statutes\u201d \u2014 not in \u201can essentially noncriminal and regulatory area of inquiry.\u201d (Citations omitted.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AcK\"><em>California v. Byers, supra </em>at 430.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b498-11\">Thus, we conclude that HRS \u00a7 291C-14 did not violate defendant\u2019s privilege against self-incrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-12\">Affirmed in part, reversed in part, and rem\u00e1nded for action consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"Ae1\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number><em>Arthur E.
