The dismissal with prejudice came upon defendant\u2019s oral motion after the jury was sworn but before evidence was taken. The court found that the State violated Rule 16(b)(2)(ii),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Hawaii Rules of Penal Procedure, because the State failed to furnish a police report<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> to the defendant before trial. The trial court also found that the police report contained exculpatory evidence and the State\u2019s failure to furnish it violated defendant\u2019s constitutional rights under <em>Brady v. </em>Maryland.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The court thereupon imposed sanction and dismissed the charges against defendant. We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-6\">We distinguish <em>Brady </em>from this case. Brady was convicted of murder. After his conviction, he learned that the government had suppressed and failed to disclose to him a statement made by his accomplice admitting the actual killing. The court found that this deliberate withholding of crucial material by the prosecution did not comport with standards of justice and that Brady was given an unfair trial. <em>Brady </em>therefore held that the suppression by the prosecution of evidence favorable to an accused who has requested it violates the accused\u2019s due process rights where the evidence is material either to guilt or punishment, irrespective of the good faith or bad faith of the prosecution. <em>See also State v. Kahinu, </em>53 Haw. 536, 498 P.2d 635 (1972), <em>cert. denied, </em>409 U.S. 1126 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b410-7\">In this case, standards of justice, fair trial and due process are not involved. The dismissal came at a time when trial had barely begun. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>After the jury was sworn, the motion to dismiss was made. At that point in time, defendant was already in possession of a copy of the police report, albeit through a subpoena duces tecum, rather than through discovery. Defense obtained the report on the first day of trial, but defense knew of the existence of this report from the very moment defendant was charged and throughout pretrial, made no attempt to seek the aid of the court for an earlier production. Defense made no request at any time for a continuance. There was no showing of prejudice because of the delay. In fact, there was no attempt to rectify the prejudice, if any. We hold that it was error for the trial court to conclude that there was a <em>Brady </em>violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-5\">Even without a <em>Brady </em>violation, the trial court is nevertheless empowered to dismiss under HRPP Rule 16(e)(8)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> for noncompliance of Rule 16. Obviously, the sanction of dismissal is addressed to the sound discretion of the court. Admittedly, there appears to be a technical violation of the rules herein; but the violation was not ill-inspired. The prosecution\u2019s failure to disclose resulted from nonfeasance on the part of the police to forward the report in question to the prosecutor along with three other reports which were disclosed to defense within sufficient time for defense to prepare.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-6\">In exercising the broad discretion as to sanctions, the trial court should take into account the reasons why the disclosure was not made, the extent of prejudice, if any, the feasibility of rectifying that prejudice by a continuance, and any other relevant circumstances. Wright, <em>Federal Practice and Procedure </em>\u00a7 260.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-7\">We hold that the trial judge abused his discretion in dismissing the charges against defendant. <em>State v. Kahinu, supra.</em></p>\n<attorneys id=\"AhJ\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number><em>Stanford H. Masui, </em>First Deputy Prosecuting Attorney, County of Hawaii, for plaintiff-appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"Aj2\"><em>Andrew P. Wilson </em>for defendant-appellee.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b412-3\">Jurisdiction of this court is invoked by HRS \u00a7 641-13(2)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and not \u00a7 641-13(1)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> as the government urges. Hence, this court is without jurisdiction if the dismissal has put defendant in jeopardy.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-4\">We hold that, under the circumstances of this case, where defendant moved for and obtained a dismissal immediately after the jury was sworn, preventing a trial to determine his guilt or innocence, no jeopardy attaches. <em>United States v.
