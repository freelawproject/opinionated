Plaintiffs-appellants, recipients of public assistance under programs administered by the DSSH, contend the published notices failed to state the \u201csubstance\u201d of the proposed amendments, as required by HRS \u00a7 91-3.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Defendant-appellee, the Director of the department, maintains the notices he caused to be published were legally sufficient and the circuit court was correct in awarding him summary judgment on the action for declaratory relief brought by Plain tiffs-appellants. We conclude the notices did not reflect the \u201csubstance\u201d of the rule changes contemplated by the DSSH, and reverse the circuit court\u2019s award of judgment to Defendant-appellee.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-8\">The first notice appeared in the Honolulu Advertiser and the Honolulu Star-Bulletin on June 25, 1981. It covered a planned format change in the rules of the department\u2019s Public Welfare Division to fulfill a HAPA requirement of a uniform format for the publication, filing, and indexing of rules by all state agencies. The notice also mentioned \u201csome substantive changes to the rules of the Public Welfare Division.\u201d The \u201csubstantive changes\u201d contemplated by the department actually were a host of significant rule changes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>affecting recipients of public assistance and touching all phases of the welfare programs within the department\u2019s jurisdiction from conditions of eligibility for assistance payments to their possible recoupment.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Hearings as advertised were conducted throughout the state on July 24, 1981.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-5\">The second notice appeared in the same newspapers on October 25, 1981, and advertised public hearings scheduled for November 18, 19, and 20, 1981. It stated, <em>inter alia, </em>that portions of the department\u2019s proposed new rules \u201cthat were heard on July 24, 1981 but have not yet been adopted\u201d would be reheard. It further declared that a substantial number of chapters of the department\u2019s rules had been \u201crewritten to reflect recent changes to the Social Security Act and Food Stamp Act as a result of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1981 (Public Law No. 97-35).\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b406-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>Plaintiffs-appellants filed their complaint for declaratory judgment on November 5,1981 and simultaneously sought to enjoin the conduct of the scheduled hearings. The requested preliminary injunctive relief was granted by a circuit judge, but we vacated the injunction on the Director\u2019s petition because of the possible irreparable harm it posed for the department. Summary judgment in favor of Defendant-appellee was subsequently granted by another circuit judge, and Plaintiffs-appellants\u2019 timely appeal to this court followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-7\">A \u201cstated objective of the rule-making provisions of the HAPA is *[t]o provide for public participation in the rule-making process, by allowing any interested person to petition for a change in the rules as well as to participate in a public hearing.\u2019 \u201d <em>Aguiar v. Hawaii Housing Authority, </em>55 Haw. 478, 487, 522 P.2d 1255, 1261-62 (1974). And \u201cthe legislature has ... made the judgment. . . that an agency must consider the views of interested persons where it seeks to promulgate a \u2018rule,\u2019 no matter how complex is the data that goes into the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>rule\u2019s formulation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 487-88, 522 P.2d at 1262. HRS \u00a7 91-3 demands advance notice of an administrative agency\u2019s plan to adopt, amend, or repeal its rules; it further provides that the notice shall contain \u201ca statement of the substance of the proposed rule.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Thus, the notice should fairly apprise interested parties of what is being propos\u00e9d so they can formulate and present rational responses to the proposal. Viewed in this light, the notices in question were inadequate.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-5\">The first advertisement publicized department proposals to recast the rules of the Public Welfare Division in a new format and to make \u201csome substantive changes.\u201d <em>See </em>note 2 <em>supra. </em>The second promulgated the department\u2019s intention to rewrite thirty-nine chapters of the rules \u201cto reflect recent changes to the Social Security Act and Food Stamp Act as a result of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1981.\u201d <em>See </em>note 3 <em>supra. </em>The form conversion poses no problem, and Plaintiffs-appellants raise no question about the portion of the initial notice related thereto. But the \u201csubstantive changes\u201d mentioned in the first advertisement and the declared intention of the department to rewrite the rules \u201cto reflect recent changes\u201d to the Social Security and Food Stamp Acts in the second are causes for concern.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-6\">Wholesale rule changes adversely affecting recipients of assistance were planned and adopted because of the passage of the foregoing federal legislation and other considerations. This is corroborated by the summary of the changes, which was subsequently distributed to the department\u2019s staff.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Yet the necessary notices, in our opinion, gave no inkling of what was actually in store even when read throughout.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>HRS \u00a7 91-3, as we have seen, obligates an agency contemplating rule changes to inform the public of the \u201csubstance\u201d of the impending changes and to \u201c[a]fford all interested persons opportunity to submit data, views or arguments, orally or in writing.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Defendantappellee claims the department met this obligation by setting forth the essentials of what it proposed to do. We disagree, for the \u201csubstance\u201d of a proposed rule \u201cmeans not merely the. subject of it, but an intelligible abstract or synopsis of its material and substantial elements.\u201d <em>State v. Brooks, </em>241 Ala. 55, 56, 1 So.2d 370, 370 (1941); <em>accord, Parrish v. Faulk, </em>293 Ala. 401, 404, 304 So.2d 194, 197 (1974). The notices in question stated little more than the headings of the new rules and did not provide interested persons with sufficient information to \u201cdirect their comments toward concrete proposals.\u201d <em>National Tour Brokers Association v. United States, </em>591 F.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>896, 901 (D.C. Cir. 1978). And the purpose of HRS \u00a7 91-3 \u201cto make criticism or formulation of alternatives possible\u201d was disserved thereby. <em>Home Box Office, Inc. v. Federal Communications Commission, </em>567 F.2d 9, 36 (D.C.
