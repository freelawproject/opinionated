Lopez. The provisions in question concern the distribution of income prior to the termination of the trust and the distribution of the corpus upon said termination.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-11\">Respondents-Appellants, Anthony J. Lopez, et al., appeal particularly from paragraphs 1(a), 1(b), 2(b) and 3<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> of the lower court\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>Order Denying Motion for Summary Judgment and Determining Trust\u2019s Provisions, Denying Objections Thereto, and Awarding Fees, filed August 3, 1977. The court below ruled that the terms \u201cchild\u201d and \u201cchildren\u201d in the trust meant issue or lineal descendants. It further construed the phrase \u201cin equal shares\u201d to effect a per stirpital distribution of income and corpus among the lineal descendants of certain named beneficiaries.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-6\">After closely examining the content of the trust document to determine the intent of the Settlor and reviewing the relevant legal precepts, we reverse the decision of the lower court, holding that the terms \u201cchild\u201d or \u201cchildren\u201d refer to the immediate offspring or issue of the first generation, that the income shall be distributed per stirpes to the issue of the first generation, and that the corpus shall be distributed per capita among the Settlor\u2019s grandchildren who are living upon the termination of the trust.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-8\">The Settlor, Antonio J. Lopez, created an inter vivos trust which provided, <em>inter alia, </em>that after his death, the income was to be paid to his wife and to eight named individuals: his seven children and one godchild<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> (referred to hereafter as the \u201cNamed Eight\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b60-9\">Prior to the termination of the trust, the \u201cchildren\u201d of any deceased member of the Named Eight were entitled to take their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>parent\u2019s share of the income. The specific provision describing the distribution of income stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b61-5\">(e) to the said Kaahanui Lopez, during her life, of the said annuity of $600.00 until the said mortgage shall be paid and the annuity of $900.00 thereafter during the life of the said Kaahanui Lopez and subject to the said payments, to pay the said rents, issues and profits to the said Antone J. Lopez, the younger, Clara Lopez, Manuel J. Lopez, Rosa Lopez, Caezer Lopez, Richard Lopez, Christina Lopez and Joseph P. Medeiros and to the survivors or survivor of them during their, his or her lives or life in equal shares while there are more than one of them, provided however, that if any of the said [Named Eight] shall die leaving a <em>child </em>or <em>children </em>surviving him or her, than in every such case, such last mentioned <em>child, </em>or <em>children, </em>shall, so long as any of the [Named Eight] shall be living, take the share of the said annual income which <em>his, her or their </em>parent would have taken if such <em>parent </em>had continued to live, <em>in equal shares if more than one. </em>(Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b61-6\">Upon the death of the last survivor of the Named Eight, the corpus was to be distributed among \u201call of the children\u201d of the named beneficiaries. The provision for the distribution of the trust corpus read in part:<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b61-7\">AND IT IS HEREBY further agreed and declared that after the death of the last survivor of the [Named Eight], an undivided two-thirds of the said premises shall be held by the Trustee or his successors in trust.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b61-8\">IN TRUST for <em>all of the children </em>of the [Named Eight] who shall be living at the time of the death of the last survivor of the [Named Eight] <em>in equal shares if more than one. </em>(Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Aq8q\">Only one of the Named Eight, Richard Lopez, was alive at the inception of this case, but he died during the pendency of this appeal. Hence the corpus must now be distributed among the rightful beneficiaries.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-9\">Another of the Settlor\u2019s children, Clara Lopez Tavares (referred to in the trust deed as Clara Lopez), died on May 28, 1942, survived <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>by three children: Nina A. White (still living), and Edward Abdul, Sr. and Daniel L. Abdul (both now deceased). Edward Abdul, Sr. died on December 4, 1972, being survived by his widow, Aurelia Fern Abdul, and a minor adopted child, Edward Abdul, Jr. In his Last Will and Testament, Edward Abdul, Sr. made the following disposition of his residuary estate:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b62-6\"><em>Third: </em>I give, devise and bequeath all the rest, residue and remainder of my estate, real, personal and mixed, whereso\u00e9ver situate and of every kind and nature, and any property over which I may possess any power of appointment by Will or otherwise, hereinafter called my \u201cresiduary estate,\u201d to my wife, Aurelia Fern Abdul, absolutely, if she shall survive me.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b62-7\">In view of the foregoing testamentary provision, Bishop Trust Company, Ltd. (hereinafter Petitioner), successor trustee of said trust established by Antonio J. Lopez, was in doubt as to whether Aurelia Fern Abdul was entitled to the share of income formerly payable to her husband, Edward Abdul, Sr., by virtue of the Lopez trust. Additionally, Petitioner questioned whether either the minor adopted child of Edward, Sr. or the other surviving descendants of Clara Lopez Tavares have any rights to such income under the Lopez trust. Finally, Petitioner was uncertain as to the distribution of the corpus upon the termination of the deed of trust. Petitioner thus filed a Petition for Instructions on October 12, 1973, in the Circuit Court of the First Circuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-8\">On September 21,1976, Petitioner moved the court for an order granting partial summary judgment pursuant to Rule 56, H.R.C.P. Petitioner urged the court to rule that Edward Abdul, Sr.\u2019s right to income was transferred to his wife Aurelia Abdul; that her assignment of this income right to her son, Edward, Jr. was effective until the termination of the trust; and that prior to the termination of the trust, any grandchild of the Settlor who had a right to share in the income from the trust could convey such a right either by an inter vivos disposition or by will.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-9\">Several Respondents<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> comprised of the Settlor\u2019s great-grandchildren opposed Petitioner\u2019s motion for partial summary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>judgment. Their memoranda in opposition basically suggested that the income and corpus of the trust should be distributed per stirpes among the lineal descendants of the Settlor.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-5\">OnFebruary 15,1977, Respondents AnthonyJ. Lopez and other grandchildren and great-grandchildren of the Settlor submitted an objection to a proposed order denying Petitioner\u2019s motion for summary judgment. These respondents basically concurred with Petitioner\u2019s motion and added that the corpus should be distributed per capita among the then living grandchildren of the Settlor at the end of the trust.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-6\">The court ultimately rendered an order denying Petitioner\u2019s motion for summary judgment and Respondents-Appellants, Anthony J. Lopez, et al., have appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-8\">We first consider whether the terms \u201cchild\u201d and \u201cchildren\u201d in the Lopez trust were intended to refer to immediate offspring rather than the issue and lineal descendants of the Named Eight. In other words, did the Settlor intend to effect a general distribution of income and corpus among all his lineal descendants or simply a distribution only among the Named Eight and their immediate offspring?</p>\n<p id=\"b63-9\">A fundamental rule is that the intention of the settlor as expressed in a trust instrument shall prevail unless inconsistent with some positive rule of law. <em>Bishop Trust Co. v. Cooke Trust Co., </em>39 Haw. 641 (1953); <em>Walker v. O\u2019Brien, </em>35 Haw. 13 (1939). Moreover, in construing a trust document to determine the settlor\u2019s intent, the instrument must be read as a whole, not in fragments. <em>In re Weill\u2019s Trust Estate, </em>48 Haw. 553, 406 P.2d 718 (1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b63-10\">We have examined the trust instrument in its entirety and it indicates that the only persons who are entitled to either income or a share in the corpus after the deaths of the Named Eight are their \u201cchildren.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b63-11\">The law is well settled in Hawaii that the word \u201cchildren\u201d in its primary and common meaning is limited to descendants in the first degree, the immediate offspring of the parent. Unless a clear indication of a contrary intention appears from the context, the term \u201cchildren\u201d must be taken in this sense and not as including grand<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>children. <em>Wodehouse v. Robinson, </em>27 Haw. 462 (1923); <em>accord, Estate of Hartwell, </em>23 Haw. 213 (1916); <em>see generally </em>104 A.L.R. 282 (1936); 14 A.L.R.2d 1242 (1950); Restatement of the Law, Property \u00a7 285 (1940).</p>\n<p id=\"b64-4\">The case of Wodehouse v. Robinson illustrates this general rule. There, the forty-eighth clause of Testatrix\u2019s will read in part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b64-5\">\u201cprovided, however, that if my brother or any of my sisters shall die at any time leaving a <em>child </em>or <em>children </em>surviving him or her then in every such case and until the death of the last survivor of my brother and sisters such <em>child </em>or <em>children </em>(in equal shares while there shall be more than one) shall have the use, benefit, enjoyment and income of and from my said Trust Estate, which his or her or their parent would have taken if living,.. .\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b64-6\">27 Haw. at 467-68. The main issue concerned the meaning of \u201cchild\u201d or \u201cchildren.\u201d The court held the terms \u201cchild\u201d and \u201cchildren\u201d to mean immediate offspring or descendants of the first generation and not more remote descendants.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> It opted for the primary and ordinary meaning of the terms because the context in which the terms were used did not mandate a contrary interpretation. In addition, the court reasoned that if the word \u201cchildren\u201d was read as including grandchildren, then the word \u201cparent\u201d as used by the decedent would likewise be subject to a strained construction. The primary and ordinary meaning of \u201cparent\u201d should be one who begets immediate offspring.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-7\">The instant case closely resembles the situation in <em>Wodehouse. </em>The testatrix there died on February 11, 1914. Mrs. Jaeger, her sister, died on November 29, 1921, survived by two children. Mrs. Jaeger had two other children, James and Henry, who predeceased <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>her, the first survived by five children and the second survived by one child. The question raised was whether the income payable to Mrs. Jaeger during her lifetime was now payable in full to her two surviving children, or payable in part to Mrs. Jaeger\u2019s grandchildren (those six children of her predeceased sons, James and Henry). \u25a0</p>\n<p id=\"b65-5\">In both cases, the income was left to certain named individuals and to the \u201cchild or children\u201d who survived those named individuals. Both trusts provided that if a named individual died prior to the termination of the trust, the surviving \u201cchild or children\u201d would take the share which <em>his, her or their parent </em>would have taken if living. The use of the word \u201cparent\u201d in both cases indicates to us that the settlor or testator intended the term \u201cchildren\u201d to include only issue of the first generation. Following <em>Wodehouse v. Robinson, supra, </em>which cites <em>Estate of Hartwell, supra, </em>with approval, we are inclined to hold the term \u201cchild or children\u201d to refer to immediate offspring or issue of the first generation.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-6\">Respondents-Appellees (hereinafter Appellees), however, argue the ordinary meaning of \u201cchildren\u201d is inapplicable because the instant appeal presents an exceptional situation wherein the term \u201cchildren\u201d means issue or lineal descendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-7\">There are three basic exceptions to the general rule that the term \u201cchildren\u201d means the immediate offspring of the parent. <em>See generally </em>14 A.L.R.2d 1250 (1940). The third exception covers a situation where a construction of the term \u201cchildren\u201d to include grandchildren is required by applicable statutory provisions. <em>See Berry v. Brokeshoulder, </em>162 F.2d 651 (10th Cir. 1947), This statutory exception neither was raised on appeal nor can be found in our statutes and we do not address this exception here.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-8\">The first exception occurs where an intention that the terms \u201cchild\u201d or \u201cchildren\u201d shall include grandchildren is manifest from other provisions of the will (or trust) or from the whole dispositive scheme described in the instrument. <em>See Estate of Hartwell, supra; see generally </em>14 A.L.R.2d 1250 (1940). Appellees contend this exception applies here, citing <em>Estate of Kanoa, </em>47 Haw. 610, 393 P.2d 753 (1964); <em>Trust Estate of Meek, </em>42 Haw. 335 (1958); <em>Kahananui v. Maunakea, </em>20 Haw. 114 (1910). We disagree. There is nothing in the language of the trust suggesting that Antonio Lopez did not use the word \u201cchildren\u201d in its ordinary sense. Hence, Appellees have misplaced their reliance on this first exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>The second exception applies where the will or trust would remain inoperative unless the words \u201cchildren\u201d and \u201cchild\u201d are extended beyond their natural and ordinary meaning. <em>See Estate of Hartwell, supra; see generally </em>14 A.L.R.2d 1258 (1940). Here, the trust would not be inoperative if \u201cchildren\u201d receives the ordinary construction. There are at least thirty children of the Named Eight who would take if the term \u201cchildren\u201d is given its common meaning.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-6\">We, therefore, hold that the terms \u201cchild\u201d and \u201cchildren\u201d throughout the Deed of Trust of Antonio J. Lopez are limited to their ordinary and common meaning, being issue of the first generation or immediate offspring. Given this limited interpretation of the terms in question, we now consider the manner in which the income and corpus shall be distributed.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-8\">The second issue involves the distribution of income prior to the termination of the trust. Before the last survivor of the N amed Eight died, what rights did a \u201cchild\u201d or \u201cchildren\u201d of the deceased named beneficiaries have in the trust income?</p>\n<p id=\"b66-9\">The pertinent trust language states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b66-10\">that if any of the said [Named Eight] shall die leaving a child or children surviving him or her, then in every such case, <em>such last mentioned child, or children, shall,... take the share of the said annual income which his, her or their parent would have taken if such parent had continued to live, in equal shares if more than one. </em>(Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A4\">Appellants contend that any of the grandchildren of the Settlor who is a recipient of the income right prior to the termination of the trust may dispose of that right by inter vivos transfer or by will, citing <em>Walker v. O\u2019Brien, </em>35 Haw. 13 (1939).</p>\n<p id=\"b66-11\">We agree that the opinion in <em>Walker v. O\u2019Brien </em>is dispositive of this issue. We held in <em>Walker </em>that upon the death of the settlor his children then living had a vested right in the income which would last until the time of final distribution of the corpus. Furthermore, when one of the children died the right to receive the income passed to his or her estate; it was not applied to augment the shares of the other children.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-12\">The <em>Walker </em>opinion reasoned that the settlor \u201cirrevocably\u201d conveyed to each of his four children who survived him a one-fourth <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>share in the net income of his trust estate as tenants in common for the duration of the trust. Such child was free to make an inter vivos or testamentary disposition of the income right. <em>Id. </em>at 17. The court invoked the rule that \u201ca personal annuity given for a term of years or <em>for the life of another </em>does not terminate at the death of the annuitant but passes to his personal representatives.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b67-5\">The facts in <em>Walker v. O\u2019Brien </em>were fairly simple. One of the setdor\u2019s daughters, May Clark, survived the settlor but later died leaving surviving her a husband and an adopted child. Mrs. Clark left a will under which she bequeathed all of her estate to her husband and her adopted child in equal shares. The last surviving child of the settlor filed a suit to have the court construe the trust instrument. The plaintiffs contention was that May Clark\u2019s right to or with respect to the share of the income terminated upon her death and that she had no power to dispose of it by will or otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-6\">The resemblance between the disposition of income in the <em>Walker </em>trust and the disposition of income in the Antonio J. Lopez trust is critical. In <em>Walker, </em>each of the settlor\u2019s four children had a right as tenant in common to one-quarter of the income until the trust ended; in the Lopez trust, each grandchild of the settlor has a per stirpes right<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> as tenant in common to the one-eighth share his or her parent held in the trust income until the trust ends. Each income taker in <em>Walker </em>was authorized to convey his right to the income, either inter vivos or by will, until the trust terminated; similarly, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>there is nothing in the facts or in the law to compel a different conclusion, each grandchild income taker in the Lopez trust should be authorized to convey his right to the income, either inter vivos or by will, until the trust terminates.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-6\">Hence, based on our holding in <em>Walker v. O\u2019Brien, </em>we conclude that Edward W. Abdul, a grandchild of the Settlor, had a vested right to the income from the trust until the trust terminated. In addition, he had a right to dispose of such interest by either inter vivos conveyance or by his will.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-7\">As to Appellees\u2019 position, we reject their argument that <em>In re Trust Estate of Holt, </em>42 Haw. 129 (1957), articulates the governing precept for the issue at hand. Relying on <em>Holt, </em>Appellees contend that the income should be distributed per stirpes among the lineal descendants of the Named Eight. Moreover, Appellees aver that the Named Eight had only a life interest in the trust income during the term of the trust and could only pass a life interest to their children.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-8\">The provisions of the will of George H. Holt, however, relating to the disposition of income and. corpus are significantly different from the provisions in the trust of Antonio J. Lopez. In <em>Holt, </em>the settlor provided that the trust income be paid \u201cto all of <em>my heirs in equal shares per stirpes.\u201d</em><footnotemark><em>8</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The settlor clearly directed payment of income to his \u201cheirs\u201d in equal shares per stirpes.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The court in <em>Holt </em>was not compelled to strain the applicable rules of construction to find the settlor\u2019s intent. On the other hand, the trust language in the instant case, and in <em>Walker v. O\u2019Brien, </em>does not contain the word <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>\u201cheirs.\u201d Instead, Antonio Lopez specifically provided that the \u201cchild\u201d or \u201cchildren\u201d surviving each of the Named Eight shall take his, her or their parent\u2019s share of the trust income for as long as any of the named beneficiaries are alive.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-5\">We hold, therefore, that <em>Walker v. O\u2019Brien </em>remains the law in Hawaii and is dispositive of the instant issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-6\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-7\">The final issue concerns the distribution of the corpus of the Lopez trust. Should the corpus be distributed per capita or per stirpes among the grandchildren of Antonio J. Lopez?</p>\n<p id=\"b69-8\">The relevant provision provides that two-thirds of the corpus shall be held in trust <em>\u201cfor all of the children </em>of the [Named Eight] who shall be living at the time of the death of the last survivor of the [Named Eight] in equal shares if more than one.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b69-9\">The use of the phrase \u201cfor all of the children of the [Named Eight]\u201d clearly indicates to this court that the Settlor intended to treat these \u201cchildren\u201d as a single group. They are all related in the same degree to the Settlor who would be their grandfather. The trust language fails to evince any unequal treatment of the grandchildren by the Settlor.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-10\">Accordingly, the disposition of the corpus in the Lopez trust falls precisely within the example of a per capita distribution of a class gift. Section 300 of the Restatement Property reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b69-11\">When a conveyance creates a class gift by a limitation in favor of the <em>\"children,\u201d </em>\u201cgrandchildren,\u201d \u201cbrothers,\u201d \u201csisters,\u201d \u201cnephews,\u201d \u201cnieces,\u201d \u201ccousins,\u201d \u201cbrothers and sisters,\u201d or \u201cnephews and nieces\u201d of a designated person, or by some other similar single group designation, and the membership in such class has been ascertained in accordance with the rules stated in \u00a7\u00a7 285-299, then distribution to the members of the class is made upon a per capita basis except to the extent that a different mode of distribution is required either</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b69-12\">(a) for the effectuation of another and different intent of the conveyor found from additional language or circumstances; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b69-13\">(b) by the rule stated in \u00a7 302 with respect to a limitation in favor of a subordinate class substituted as the takers of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>share which would have been taken by a member of the main class, if he had lived to the time of distribution.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"Axo\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b70-6\">Professor Powell\u2019s view as stated in 3 Powell on Real Property, paragraph 368, is in harmony with the restatement citation referred to above.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Essentially, Powell and the restatement emphasize three key elements which can be found in the instant trust language. First, a class gift has been created in favor of the children of the named beneficiaries. Second, the members of the class stand in identical relation to the Settlor. Third, the instructions are such that distribution shall be in \u201cequal shares if more than one.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b70-7\">The third factor strengthens the preference for a per capita distribution, especially where the first two elements are present. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>Words such as \u201cin equal shares,\u201d \u201cdivided equally,\u201d and \u201cshare and share alike\u201d usually import equal treatment, or a division per capita. <em>See Lidgate v. Danford, </em>23 Haw. 317 (1916); <em>see generally Houts v. Jameson, </em>201 N.W.2d 466 (Iowa 1972); <em>Will of Dow, </em>390 N.Y.S.2d 721 (1977); G. <em>Bogert, Trusts, Trustees, </em>\u00a7 182, 340 n.17 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b71-5\">Consequently, there is little doubt that Antonio J. Lopez intended a per capita distribution of the corpus among the children of the Named Eight.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-6\">Appellees, on the other hand, contend that the corpus must be distributed per stirpes between the lineal descendants, or issue, of the Settlor. Appellees offer several arguments to reach this conclusion. Unfortunately, we find these contentions unconvincing.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-7\">First, Appellees contend that by allowing a per capita distribution only among the immediate offspring of the Named Eight would work an inequitable or \u201cabsurd result.\u201d In short, the great grandchildren of the Settlor would be disinherited under such interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-8\">This court, however, is not called upon to conjecture why the Settlor wrote the trust the way he did. The only possible inequity here is that certain Appellees will not receive a share of the trust that they might have received as heirs-at-law. Nevertheless, a settlor is not obligated to dispose of his property in accord with the laws of descent and distribution. <em>Estate of Hartwell, supra.</em><footnotemark><em>12</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b71-9\">Second, Appellees stress the theory that courts generally favor a per stirpes distribution as opposed to a per capita distribution.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-10\">We find that this point is certainly not a rule to be applied in all cases, particularly when it is contrary to the clear intent of the settlor. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>We stated in <em>Peters &amp; McLean v. Vannatta et al., </em>41 Haw. 249 (1955), that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b72-6\">The cases are countless and seemingly in hopeless confusion as to the preference of courts for per-stirpes or per-capita distribution[.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b72-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 265. We further recognized our duty in <em>Vannatta </em>to ascertain the intention of the testator as expressed in the will. This duty applies to a trust situation as well.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> We find the Settlor\u2019s intentions here are clear as to the distribution of the corpus among his grandchildren. The language expresses a division per capita.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-8\">Finally, Appellees rely upon the quotation from <em>Estate of Kanoa, supra, </em>that \u201c[t]he fact that the income is distributable per stirpes is sufficient grounds for presuming a like distribution of the corpus.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 624. Based on this statement, Appellees advocate a per stirpital division of the corpus in the instant case.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-9\">In <em>Estate of Kanoa, </em>the portion of the will of the testatrix containing the income and corpus provisions read as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b72-10\">\u201c \u2018And after the death of Kaupiko (k) and Kaluaihalawa (k), and the attainment of majority by Hoomalu (w), Kaleipualiilii (w), Eva Kapualanilehua (w), and Lukela (k), I direct my Trustee to equally divide all of the income from my estate among Kanehiwa (k), Hoomalu (w), Kaleipualiilii (w), Eva Kapualanilehua (w) and Lukela (k), and should any of them die without <em>\u201ckeiki\", </em>then the portion of the income of the one who died without <em>\u201ckeiki\u201d </em>shall be equally divided among the survivors, but if any of them die leaving any <em>\u201ckeikiponoi\u201d </em>surviving then the portion of the one who died shall be divided among the <em>\u201ckeiki\u201d </em>who are living. And after the death of Kanehiwa (k), Hoomalu (w), Keleipualiilii (w), Eva Kapualanilehua (w), and Lukela (k), I direct my Trustee to equally divide all of my estate among the <em>heirs of their body. </em>Provided, however, should any of them, that is, Kanehiwa (k), Hoomalu (w), Kaleipualiilii (w), Eva Kapualanilehua (w) and Lukela (k), die without <em>\u201ckeiki\u201d, </em>then the heirs of the body of those above <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>described shall receive the estate, which shall be equally divided among them.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b73-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 614-15 (emphasis added). The court in <em>Kanoa </em>found that testatrix used the word <em>\u201ckeiki\" </em>in the inclusive sense of \u201ca descendant of any generation.\u201d In addition, the court stated that if testatrix had intended \u201cheirs of the body\u201d to mean <em>\u201ckeiki\u201d </em>in the limited sense of immediate children, there would have been no reason to bring in \u201cheirs of the body\u201d to denote children, testatrix instead would have continued to use <em>\u201ckeiki.\u201d</em><footnotemark><em>14</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Finally, the court found that the general testamentary plan clearly called for a per stirpital distribution of income and corpus. <em>Id. </em>at 623.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-6\">In the instant case the trust clearly calls for a per stirpes distribution of the income. The language provides that the income which \u201chis, her or their parent\u201d would have taken shall go to such child or children \u201cin equal shares if more than one.\u201d We fail to find this language in the corpus provision. If the Settlor intended a per stirpital distribution of the corpus, he naturally would have used similar language as in the income provision. The fact that Settlor failed to do so is a significant indication of his intent for a per capita distribution of the corpus.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-7\">Thus after close examination of the trust instrument and application of certain guiding principles, we reverse the order of the lower court, and hold (1) the term \u201cchild and children\u201d in the relevant trust provisions means immediate offspring or issue of the first generation; (2) the income shall be distributed per stirpes to the children of each member of the Named Eight who died before the termination of the trust; and (3) the corpus shall be divided among the surviving \u201cchildren\u201d per capita.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"Ams\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number><em>Robert M.

I respectfully dissent. I would affirm the decision of the lower court and hold that the settlor\u2019s dispositive plan was to effect a per stirpital distribution of the trust income and of the corpus.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-12\">Intention of the settlor is the paramount consideration in the construction of a trust instrument and that intention is to be gathered from the whole instrument and is not limited to any particular clause. <em>In re Weill\u2019s Estate, </em>48 Haw. 553, 406 P.2d 718 (1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b74-13\">Thus, in the case at bar, the settlor\u2019s intention is to be ascertained from a consideration of the trust instrument as a whole and not from its disjointed fragments. When looking at the Lopez trust instrument as a whole, the corpus provision must be read in a light consistent with the income provision. Beginning with the language in the income section, the settlor manifested an intent to substitute children for parents in the event the parents were deceased. This substitution was to continue beyond the first generation.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-14\">The settlor\u2019s testamentary plan contemplated a trust of long duration. There is nothing in the trust to indicate that the settlor intended that the trust should be narrowly interpreted to deprive great-grandchildren of their fair share. I conclude that the settlor used the term \u201cchildren\u201d to mean \u201cissue\u201d throughout the trust instrument.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-15\">This conclusion is supported by the well recognized rule that where language is equivocal a construction enuring to the benefit of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>remote lineal descendants is preferred to one which favors immediate issue exclusively. <em>See In re Carnegie\u2019s Estate, </em>397 Pa. 308, 155 A.2d 349, 353, 355 (1959), and <em>In re Clark\u2019s Estate, </em>359 Pa. 411, 59 A.2d 109 <em>(1948).Also, Peters and McLean v. Vannatta, </em>41 Haw. 249, 266 (1955).</p>\n<p id=\"b75-5\">In the case at bar, the general trust plan of the settlor was to provide for the issue of his \u201cnamed eight\u201d children. To be consistent with this general trust plan, the term \u201cchildren\u201d \u00e1s used in both the income and corpus provisions of the instrument must be construed to refer to the lineal descendants of the \u201cnamed eight.\u201d Further, as pointed out by this court in <em>Peters and McLean v. Vannatta, supra, </em>where the devisees bear different degrees of relationship to a testator or settlor, the per stirpes distribution must be upheld if the question of distribution is in doubt. <em>Id. </em>at 266. To be consistent with the settlor\u2019s general trust plan and with the rules governing equivocal language, the corpus distribution must be made on a per stirpital basis.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
