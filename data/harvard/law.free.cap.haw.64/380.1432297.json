We find that HRS Chapter 386 vests original jurisdiction to determine issues arising under the Hawaii Workers\u2019 Compensation Law in the Director of Labor and Industrial Relations (the Director). And since appeals from his decisions must be taken to the Labor and Industrial Relations Appeals Board and then to this court, there is no room within the relevant scheme for circuit court action to settle the dispute. We therefore vacate the judgment of the Circuit Court of the First Circuit holding Defendant-appellant Hawaiian Insurance <em>8c </em>Guaranty Co., Ltd. (HIG) liable for compensation payments to three employees of Hawaii Roofing, Inc. (the employer) and remand the case with instructions to dismiss the complaint for declaratory judgment filed by Plaintiff-appellee Travelers Insurance Company (Travelers).</p>\n<p id=\"b395-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-6\">The root of the controversy involving the two insurance carriers was the issuance by Travelers of a workers\u2019 compensation insurance policy covering Hawaii Roofing, Inc. and a purported cancellation thereof.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> As written, the policy was to be effective for a term of one year commencing in March of 1974. But in August or September of the same year, Travelers informed the employer of an intention to cancel the policy as of October 10, 1974. Service of notice of the impending cancellation, though mandated by HRS \u00a7 386-127, was not made upon the Director of the Department of Labor and Industrial Relations (the department).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b396-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>The employer then procured insurance coverage to protect its employees for workers\u2019 compensation purposes under a policy issued by HIG that was to remain in effect for a one-year period beginning on October 15, 1974. However, HIG likewise decided to cancel its policy covering the employer prior to the stated termination date, and served the employer and the Director with notice of the contemplated action in February of 1975. The Director subsequently informed HIG that the records of the department showed Travelers to be the employer\u2019s carrier and that he found the HIG policy and the notice of cancellation without force or effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-6\">Unfortunately, in the interim between October 15, 1974 and February 1, 1975, three of Hawaii Roofing\u2019s employees sustained work injuries and made claims for benefits.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> HIG voluntarily assumed liability for compensation payments to the three claimants on the belief that it was legally responsible therefor \u2014 it had not been informed yet that the department\u2019s records indicated Travelers was still the employer\u2019s carrier. But in proceedings on the benefit claims before the Disability Compensation Division of the department, in which Travelers and HIG participated, it was determined that Travelers was the responsible carrier. The claimants were awarded benefits by separate decisions and orders issued in December of 1976, and Travelers was ordered to reimburse HIG for the payments previously made.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The reimbursement orders were premised on specific findings that: (1) the records of the department reflected Travelers was the employer\u2019s insurance carrier during the pertinent period, (2) Travelers had not served the requisite notice of cancellation upon the Director, and (3) HIG had been informed its policy was ineffectual by reason of Travelers\u2019 coverage of the employer.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-7\">Travelers appealed the decisions and orders on the claims of Paul Santos and William Drake to the Labor and Industrial Relations <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>Appeals Board (the Appeals Board); it requested a reopening of the proceedings related to James Hennessy pursuant to HRS \u00a7 386-89. But it almost simultaneously sought relief from the Director\u2019s orders through a complaint for a declaratory judgment filed in the Circuit Court of the First Circuit. Although no stay order appears to have been entered by the circuit court, the administrative proceedings before the Appeals Board and the Director were held in abeyance pending the outcome of the suit. HIG promptly moved to dismiss the declaratory action for want of jurisdiction in the circuit court. The motion was denied after argument, and Travelers was granted summary judgment thereafter. HIG\u2019s timely appeal to this court followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-6\">The primary issue argued by HIG on appeal is the jurisdictional question raised below by way of the motion to dismiss the complaint for declaratory judgment. HIG also maintains the circuit court erred in granting summary judgment to Travelers. However, our conclusion regarding the Director\u2019s original jurisdiction over all controversies and disputes arising under the Hawaii Workers\u2019 Compensation Law obviates the necessity for discussion of the second issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-7\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-8\">Our. analysis begins, as it must when statutory interpretation is entailed, with the express provision covering the Director\u2019s authority to determine disputes arising under the workers\u2019 compensation law, HRS \u00a7 386-73, which reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-9\">Original jurisdiction over controversies. Unless otherwise provided, the director of labor and industrial relations shall have original jurisdiction over all controversies and disputes arising under this chapter. The decisions of the director shall be enforceable by the circuit court as provided in section 386-91. There shall be a right of appeal from the decisions of the director to the appellate board and thence to the supreme court as provided in sections 386-87 and 386-88, but in no case shall an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>appeal operate as a supersedeas or stay unless the appellate board or the supreme court so orders.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b398-6\">Taken at face value, the foregoing would preclude original court action to settle controversies involving the workers\u2019 compensation law. It relegates the circuit court to a secondary role where workers\u2019 compensation is concerned \u2014 the enforcement of the Director\u2019s decisions. But Travelers contends there is provision elsewhere for a proper invocation of circuit court jurisdiction to resolve disputes other than those directly related to benefit claims. It asserts the circuit courts have \u201cexclusive original jurisdiction over all matters which are incidental and collateral to a worker\u2019s compensation claimant\u2019s entitlement to compensation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b398-7\">Travelers professes to find support for the above in relevant case law from other jurisdictions and in the Declaratory Judgment Act. But clear statutory mandates in HRS Chapters 386 and 632 have nevertheless deprived the circuit court of power to decide the dispute here. Despite Travelers\u2019 assertions to the contrary, the legislature has removed the circuit court from the adjudicative process in workers\u2019 compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-8\">1.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-9\">The governing statutory scheme, as we observed, decrees that the Director \u201cshall have original jurisdiction over all controversies and disputes arising under\u201d the Hawaii Workers\u2019 Compensation Law. Travelers initially attempts to. evade the clear prescript of HRS \u00a7 386-73 by labelling the dispute an \u201cequitable\u201d issue reserved for judicial scrutiny and settlement; the case in Travelers\u2019 view merely involves a possible reimbursement of one carrier by another. It contends courts elsewhere have ruled that disputes between insurance carriers not affecting a claimant\u2019s entitlement to benefits should be presented to judicial tribunals without initial resort to administrative panels. Travelers also reminds us HRS \u00a7 632-6 proclaims the Declaratory Judgment Act as \u201cremedial\u201d legislation \u201cto be liberally interpreted and administered, with a view to making the courts more serviceable to the people\u201d and HRS \u00a7 632-1 expressly sanctions a declaratory judgment even though the controversy is \u201csusceptible of relief\u2019 through another remedy.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-10\">The instant controversy stems from a purported neglect to serve <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>the Director with notice of an imminent cancellation of a workers\u2019 compensation insurance policy. Travelers would have us assume the dispute is only peripherally related to HRS Chapter 386 and its central purpose. But HRS \u00a7 \u00a7 386-121 through 128 constitute an essential component of an independent statutory system of legal relations designed to shield workers from the consequences of work injuries. S. Riesenfeld, <em>Study of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Law in Hawaii, </em>iii (1963) (Legislative Reference Bureau, Report No. 1). For this part of the law ensures the payment of compensation to injured workers. The Director has a duty thereunder of compelling employers who choose insurance as the means of securing compensation payments to their employees to maintain insurance coverage at all times.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The notice of cancellation requirement obviously serves a vital function in this regard. A dispute over an alleged failure to comply therewith definitely arises under HRS Chapter 386, is hardly an \u201cequitable\u201d issue, and is of direct concern to the Director in his enforcement of the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-5\">Tr\u00e1velers, however, argues further that agencies with functions similar to the Director\u2019s are inherently creatures of limited authority. It cites <em>Jordan v. Ferro, </em>67 N.J. Super. 188, 196, 170 A.2d 69, 73 (1961), for the proposition that \u201c[t]he law appears well settled that the question of coverage of. . . [a] policy is not within the jurisdiction of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Bureau.\u201d It also invokes a statement of the Supreme Court of California that \u201cdisputes between insurance carriers independent of the enforcement of the liability of the employer to his employee is plainly not within the jurisdiction of a tribunal created for the purpose of affording compensation benefits to workmen for injuries sustained in their industrial employment.\u201d <em>State Compensation Insurance Fund v. Industrial Accident </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number><em>Commission, </em>20 Cal.2d 264, 272, 125 P.2d 42, 47 (1942). What appears persuasive at first sight is nevertheless vitiated by its inappropriateness, as the cases construed statutory grants of authority definitely narrower in scope than that given the Director by HRS \u00a7 386-73. In <em>Jordan </em>the crucial language was \u201call claims for compensation arising under this chapter.\u201d N.J. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 34:15-49 (1959). And in <em>State Compensation Insurance Fund, </em>the Commission\u2019s jurisdiction extended over all proceedings \u201c(a) For the recovery of compensation, or concerning any right or liability arising out of or incidental thereto.\u201d 20 Cal.2d at 267, 125 P.2d at 44. In contrast the Director\u2019s jurisdiction pursuant to HRS \u00a7 386-73 is \u201cover all controversies and disputes arising under this chapter,\u201d unless otherwise provided.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-6\">Travelers claims the Director\u2019s authority is neither all-encompassing nor exclusive because the Declaratory Judgment Act \u201cprovides otherwise.\u201d But its thesis is flawed again, this time by omission, as it fails to acknowledge that a proviso in HRS \u00a7 632-1 precludes the utilization of declaratory actions in workers\u2019 compensation cases. Although section 632-1 generally endorses declaratory relief in civil cases, it nonetheless disallows such relief \u201c[wjhere ... a statute provides a special form of remedy for a specific type of case.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The \u201cindependent system of legal relations\u201d established by the Hawaii Workers\u2019 Compensation Law thus debars declaratory relief here. <em>See </em>S. Riesenfeld, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b400-7\">2.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-8\">In a previous encounter with an attempt to outflank HRS \u00a7 386-73, Ros t\u00ed. <em>Hasegawa, </em>53 Haw. 640,500 P.2d 746, <em>rehearing denied, </em>53 Haw. 670, 500 P.2d 746 (1972), we affirmed the dismissal of an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>appeal from the Director\u2019s order filed in the circuit court by a compensation claimant, an appeal purportedly premised on the right to appeal from administrative decisions and orders provided by HRS \u00a7 91-14. The claimant also sought preliminary injunctive relief against an enforcement of the Director\u2019s order. We agreed with the circuit court that his \u201cproper remedy lay in the form of an appeal to the labor and industrial relations appeals board,\u201d <em>Ras v. Hasegawa, supra, </em>53 Haw. at 641, 500 P.2d at 747, and our statement regarding original actions to block the enforcement of the Director\u2019s order was: .</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-5\">Nor may the appellant properly bring an original action in the circuit court which would bar the operative effect of the director\u2019s order. Injunctive relief should not serve to circumvent the pursuit of a timely and statutorily mandated remedy by way of appeal. <em>See Adelman v. Onischuk, </em>271 Minn. 216, 228, 135 N.W.2d 670, 678 (1965), <em>appeal dismissed </em>and <em>certiorari denied, </em>382 U.S. 108 (1965). \u201c[A] statute which provides for a thing, to be done in a particular manner or by a prescribed person or tribunal implies that it shall not be done otherwise or by a different person or tribunal. . . <em>State ex rel. Battle v. Hereford, </em>148 W. Va. 97, 103, 133 S.E.2d 86, 90 (1963).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b401-6\"><em>Id. </em>Travelers presents nothing to cause us to view the original action here in a different light!</p>\n<p id=\"b401-7\">The attempt at circumvention of statutory dictates is by no means novel; nor is our response unique. For courts in other states have rejected efforts to evade the authority of administrative agencies entrusted with the administration of workers\u2019 compensation laws through the procedural device employed here. <em>See Mid-State Construction Co. v. Means, </em>245 Ark. 691, 434 S.W.2d 292 (1968); <em>St. Paul Fire Marine Insurance Co. v. Littky, </em>60 Mich. App. 375, 230 N.W.2d 440 (1970); <em>Peak v. Bosse, </em>202 Neb. 1, 272 N.W.2d 750 (1978); <em>Cox v. Pitt County Transportation Co., </em>259 N.C. 38, 129 S.E.2d 589 (1963); <em>American Casualty Co. v. Kligerman, </em>365 Pa. 168, 74 A.2d 169 (1950); <em>Williams Furniture Corp. v. Southern Coatings </em>&amp; <em>Chemical Co., </em>216 S.C. 1, 56 S.E.2d 576 (1949). The exclusive original jurisdiction of workers\u2019 compensation tribunals has also been confirmed in other settings. <em>See, e.g., Dixon v. Sype, </em>92 Mich. App. 144, 284 N.W.2d 514 (1979); <em>Spivey v. Oakley\u2019s General Contractors, </em>32 N.C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>App. 488, 232 S.E.2d 454 (1977).</p>\n<attorneys id=\"Ad6\"><em>Stanford Manuia (Robert C.

McPheeters (Burke, Ashford, Sakai, McPheeters, Bordner </em>\u00a3si <em>Gilardy, </em>of counsel) for plaintiff-appellee.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b402-6\">The remedy for Travelers lies in appeals from the Director\u2019s orders to the Labor and Industrial Relations Appeals Board. <em>Ras v. Hasegawa, supra, </em>53 Haw. at 641, 500 P.2d at 747. The summary judgment in favor of Travelers Insurance Company is vacated, and the case is remanded to the circuit court with instructions to dismiss the complaint for declaratory judgment.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b395-7\"> The Department of Labor and Industrial Relations apparently received notice of the insurance coverage effected under the policy as required by HRS \u00a7386-122, since its records reflected that Travelers was the employer\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation insurance carrier.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b395-8\"> HRS \u00a7 386-127 reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-9\">Cancellation of insurance contracts.
