Appellant seeks a reversal of his conviction and a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-15\">Arthur Goldin, was killed at the Travel Lodge Motel in Lahaina, Maui, on or about January 4; 1979. Appellant was indicted for the murder of Goldin. On May 2, 1979, appellant was arrested in New York City by the police there. At the time of his arrest, his wallet containing credit cards belonging to the victim was seized in his room by the police without his consent and without a search warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-16\">In a pretrial hearing to suppress the seized evidence, a New York police officer testified that the consent to search appellant\u2019s room <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>was given by others who occupied the home with him. Over objection, the trial court admitted the testimony of the police officer and subsequently denied appellant\u2019s motion to suppress, concluding that the consent was voluntarily given and that the seized evidence was admissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-7\">Appellant is now contending that the court erred in admitting hearsay testimony, <em>State v. Bannister, </em>60 Haw. 658, 594 P.2d 133 (1979), thus violating his constitutional right to confrontation. <em>State v. Kim, </em>55 Haw. 346, 519 P.2d 1241 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b208-8\">Even were we to assume that the court erred in admitting hearsay testimony, the error is not to be viewed in isolation and considered purely in the abstract. It must be examined in the light of the entire proceedings and given the effect which the whole record shows it to be entitled. In that context, the real question becomes whether there is a reasonable possibility that error might have contributed to conviction. <em>State v. Pokini, </em>57 Haw. 26, 548 P.2d 1402 (1976), <em>cert. denied, </em>429 U.S. 963 (1976); <em>State v. Huihui, III, </em>62 Haw. 142, 612 P.2d 115 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b208-9\">We disagree with appellant\u2019s representation that the only evidence that linked him to the victim was the alleged inadmissible evidence. There were other evidence of substantial weight for the jury to conclude otherwise. Eye witnesses produced by the government placed appellant and the victim at or near the time of death<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> in Lahaina, Maui. Death was established in the evening of January 3, 1979 or early next morning. Appellant and the victim shared Room 115 at the Travel Lodge beginning January 3, 1979 until appellant left Maui two days later. The maintenance man and the maid identified appellant as the person they saw on the morning of January 4, 1979 in Room 115. At that time appellant told them that the victim <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>was working at night and was sleeping.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The dead body of the victim was discovered the next day in Room 115. A note found on the door stated, \u201cWill be staying one more day. I work nights so I sleep days. I will pick up the linen tomorrow. Thank you. Art.\u201d An expert from the Federal Bureau of Investigation testified that a latent fingerprint and two latent palmprints belonging to appellant were found on the note. The evidence also showed that at noon on January 4, appellant used a Master Charge credit card of victim\u2019s father<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> to purchase an airline ticket from Kahului to Honolulu. Three latent fingerprints of appellant were later found on the receipt. There were other testimonies which confirmed that appellant used the same credit card for payment of bills in Reno, Nevada. Traveller\u2019s checks belonging to victim were cashed in Honolulu on January 4th or 5th. Appellant\u2019s latent fingerprint was found on one of the checks. Evidence was also produced that appellant used a credit card \u2022belonging to victim\u2019s brother<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> in renting a car in San Francisco..</p>\n<p id=\"b209-5\">We conclude from our examination of the record that the error, if any, did not contribute to the verdict obtained and therefore was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Chapman v. California, </em>386 U.S. 18 (1967); <em>State v. Huihui, III, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b209-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-7\">Appellant was sentenced to life imprisonment with possibility of parole under HRS \u00a7 706-606(b) which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b209-8\"><em>Sentence for offense of murder. </em>The court shall sentence a person who has been convicted of murder to an indeterminate term of imprisonment. In such cases <em>the court shall impose the maximum length of imprisonment </em>as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b209-9\">(b) Life imprisonment with possibility of parole or twenty years as the court determines, in all other cases. The minimum <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>length of imprisonment shall be determined by the Hawaii paroling authority in accordance with section 706-669. (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<attorneys id=\"Aqy\"><em>Philip H. Lowenthal (Joel E. August </em>with him on the reply brief, <em>Lowenthal August) </em>for defendant-appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"ADV\"><em>BoydP. Mossman, </em>Prosecuting Attorney, County of Maui, <em>(Artemio C. Baxa, </em>Deputy Prosecuting Attorney, on the brief), for plaintiffappellee.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b210-6\">Appellant argues that \u00a7 706-606 is unconstitutional because it fails to set forth criteria for a sentencingjudge to consider before imposing a life sentence or a twenty-year sentence. <em>See State v. Huelsman, </em>60 Haw. 71, 588 P.2d 394 (1978). <em>See also United States v. Velazquez, </em>482 F.2d 139 (2d Cir. 1973). We find no merit to his argument. As we read \u00a7 706-606, it requires the sentencingjudge to impose the maximum penalty of life imprisonment with possibility of parole, except that the sentencingjudge is given the discretion to reduce it to twenty years if there are mitigating factors or circumstances which would warrant a lesser sentence. We find no constitutional infirmity in such a sentencing scheme. We also find from the record that the trial judge did not abuse his discretion in failing to impose a twenty-year sentence upon appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b208-10\"><em> </em>Appellant\u2019s statement to the police which was admitted into evidence denied that he knew victim. In the same statement, appellant claimed that the credit cards were given to him by Robin Porta in payment of a debt. Robin Porta- was never located. Appellant also admitted using the credit cards across country from San Francisco to New York.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b209-10\"> Appellant also told another maid in the late morning of January 4 that his friend (victim) was sleeping.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b209-11\"> The credit card was given to victim by his father.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b209-12\"> The credit card was given to victim by his brother.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
