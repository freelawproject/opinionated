Eldred Boland, and his then spouse, Genevieve, both residents of the state of California, separated and began to live apart. February 28, 1929, they entered into a written agreement for her support and maintenance, the settling of their respective community interests, and the adjustment and settlement of their disputes, and differences.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-28\">\u201cFor the purpose of providing for the permanent maintenance and support\u201d of the wife \u201cand in consideration of the release\u201d by her \u201cfrom all claims and demands which\u201d she might have against petitioner for support and maintenance, petitioner assigned to her twenty-five per 'cent of his income for personal services, whether rendered individually or as a member of a partnership, and such additional portion of his income necessary to make the amount assigned equal to $500 a month. The taxpayer, a practicing attorney, agreed to notify any partnership of which he might thereafter become a member, of the agreement and assignment. He further agreed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>to secure the assent of the partnership to the assignment and to obtain an agreement by the partnership to pay the income assigned directly to the wife. The agreement stated that it was the intent of the parties that the wife receive an average minimum of $500 a month throughout each calendar year. The assignment of income was to become inoperative upon remarriage of the wife.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-5\">The petition agreed that the\" community property (shares of stock; a parcel of real estate, and life insurance policies), the amounts payable to the wife from his income, and any other property in the possession of, or under the control of, the wife as of the date of the agreement, should be her separate property. Other im- \u25a0 portant parts of this agreement are set out in a marginal note.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b681-6\">The agreement of February 28, 1929, was modified on May 31, 1936, by reducing the minimum amount payable to the wife each month, from $500 to $250, and at the same time the partnership of Knight, Boland and Riordan paid to her the sum of $5,750. This latter agreement also provided that petitioner and his wife file separate income tax returns, each to include one half of the community income in his or her individual return, petitioner to reimburse the wife for amounts of tax paid by her under this arrangement in excess of the amount of tax she would have paid if she had not included one half of the community income in her gross income. It was further agreed that should this arrangement for tax returns be not allowable, the provision should be inoperative.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-15\">In' 1934 petitioner earned $6,507.20, in 1935, $12,011:04, and in 1936, $17,967.83. During the calendar year 1936 the law firm of Knight, Boland and Riordan paid Genevieve L. Boland the sum of $5,750, as not<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>ed above, and the sum was charged to petitioner\u2019s account with the firm. The petitioner made all payments required under the agreements during the taxable years, and no others were demanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-4\">For the years 1934, 1935, 1936, the petitioner reported in his income tax returns one half of his share of the income derived from personal services as an attorney at law. The Commissioner, in arriving at the deficiencies for these years, included the entire amount of petitioner\u2019s earnings in his taxable income. The Board of Tax Appeals entered its decision in favor of the Commissioner (41 B.T.A. 930), hence this petition for review in behalf of the taxpayer.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-5\">The single question to be determined is whether the separation agreement extinguished the community character of petitioner\u2019s income and thereby converted his earnings for the tax years in question into separate property. The correct answer to this problem determines petitioner\u2019s income tax liability for said years 1934, 1935, and 1936.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-6\">In the absence of an agreement to the contrary, earnings during the taxable years 1934, 1935, and 1936, would have been community property under the law of California (Civil Code Calif. \u00a7\u00a7 161a, 164), and each spouse entitled to report one half thereof in a separate return (United States v. Malcolm, 282 U.S. 792, 51 S.Ct. 184, 75 L.Ed. 714), and this applies whether or not the parties are living together (Brown v. Brown, 170 Cal. 1). 147 P. 1168. See Sparkman v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 9 Cir., 112 F.2d 774, 776. Under the law of California (Civil Code Calif. \u00a7\u00a7 158, 159), recognized by this court (Van Every v. Commissioner, 9 Cir., 108 F.2d 650; Helvering v. Hickman, 9 Cir., 70 F.2d 985; cf. Black v. Commissioner, 9 Cir., 114 F.2d 355, 358), a husband and wife, living in California, may enter into an agreement with each other altering their legal relations as to property and change the character of property from community to separate property, or from separate to community, theretofore acquired, or thereafter to be acquired. 13 Cal.Jur. \u00a7 45, pp. 845-847; Cheney v. City &amp; County of San Francisco, 7 Cal.2d 565, 569, 61 P.2d 754; Siberell v. Siberell, 214 Cal. 767, 770, 7 P.2d 1003; In re Davis\u2019 Estate, 106 Cal. 453, 455, 39 P. 756.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-8\">There is no doubt that the property settlement agreement entered into on the 28th of February, 1929, disposed of the community property theretofore acquired, and changed the status thereof to that of separate property of one or the other. To answer the question whether earnings of petitioner received subsequently thereto were changed to separate property by said agreement, or retained their character as community property, we must look to the agreement. The document provides in the preamble that-</p>\n<p id=\"b682-10\">\u201cThe parties * * * being desirous of settling * * * rights in and to the community property * * * now existing and * * * fixing and determining the character of the property hereafter to be acquired * * * \u201c * * * by each forever releasing * * * all rights, * * * which either now has or may hereafter have by virtue of the marriage relation between them and in the property of the other, whether now owned or hereafter acquired.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b682-14\">This evidences a fixed determination to strip any future income of its community character, but the operative parts of the agreement are also inconsistent with the concept of community property. For instance, the agreement provides that petitioner <em>assign </em>twenty-five per cent \u201cof his income for personal services, * * * and such additional portion * * * as shall be necessary to make the amount hereby assigned equal to the minimum of Five Hundred Dollars ($500.00) per month * * Under the laws of California \u201cThe respective interests of the husband and wife in community property during continuance of the marriage relation are present, existing and equal interests * * Civil Code Calif. \u00a7 161a. The agreement contemplates payment of the $500 a month whether earned or not (cf. Burnet v. Whitehouse, 283 U.S. 148, 151, 51 S.Ct. 374, 75 L.Ed. 916, 73 A.L.R. 1534); the twenty-five per cent is certainly not a present, existing and <em>equal- </em>interest. Van Every v. Commissioner, supra. Moreover, the contract includes payment to the wife for life, so long as she shall not remarry, even though there be a divorce, the community dissolved, and the husband marry another. Again, the term \u201cor may hereafter acquire\u201d appears in the surrender covenant applicable to each party. The agreement negatives any possibility of continuance of the community property relationship, and the provisions for support of the wife are in lieu of her right to share <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>in future earnings upon the basis of community property.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-5\">The Board of Tax Appeals reached the proper conclusion, and its decision is</p>\n<p id=\"Ao-k\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b681-7\"> \u201cAgreement, made this 28th day of February, 1929, by and between F.
