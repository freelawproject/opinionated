This appellant declined to do.</p>\n<p id=\"b1079-21\">In view of the very close relationship between the two applications they will be embraced in a single opinion, but the two appeals will be considered separately.</p>\n<p id=\"b1079-22\">Appeal No.\" 4475.</p>\n<p id=\"b1079-23\">The application involved in this appeal is No. 378,781, for the registration of the mark \u201cconsisting of the expression Vaper Marcel for hair waving pads.\u201d The registration was denied by the examiner. In his statement upon the appeal to the commissioner he said:</p>\n<p id=\"b1079-24\">\u201cThis is in answer to an appeal from the Examiner\u2019s refusal to register to applicant, under the 1905 Act, the notation \u2018Vaper Marcel\u2019 as a trade-mark for hair waving pads. The ground of refusal to register is that the mark is descriptive of the goods. Hair waving devices quite commonly employ vapors in the operation of waving. A \u201cmarcel\u201d is a form of hair wave. Therefore a \u201cVaper Marcel\u201d hair waving pad is reasonably construed as. one that assists in making a marcel by the use of vapor. The phonetic mispelling of \u201cvapor\u201d is negligible.</p>\n<p id=\"b1079-25\">\u201cThe words \u2018Vapor Marcel\u2019 having been recognized as descriptive of hair wavers and kindred devices and have been disclaimed in registration No. 221546, Va-Per-Marcel, Inc., of New York, N. Y.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1079-26\">The decision of the commissioner is brief and reads as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b1079-27\">\u201cThese are appeals from the refusal of the examiner of trade-marks to register the notation \u2018Vaper Marcel\u2019 as a trademark for hair waving pads. Two applications are involved, between which the examiner required election. Applicant traverses that requirement; but, as registration was properly refused in both cases, the point becomes immaterial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1079-28\">\u201cThe examiner refused registration on the ground that the mark is descriptive of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1022\">*1022</page-number>the goods. Applicant does not deny that its hair waving pads are used in applying vapor marcels, but argues that this fact does not render the mark descriptive of the pads, \u2018or of the character or quality of such goods,\u2019 within the meaning of section 5 of the Trade-Mark Act of February 20, 1905, under the provisions of which Act the applications were filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1080-4\">\u201cI think the argument is untenable. In my opinion the purpose for which an article of' merchandise is intended to be used is manifestly characteristic of the article.</p>\n<p id=\"b1080-5\">\u201cThe decisions are affirmed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1080-6\">We are clear that the decision of the commissioner must be affirmed. We have no doubt that the expression \u201cVa-per Marcel\u201d is descriptive of the use to which the articles are put, and is barred by section 5 of said trade-mark act as being \u201cdescriptive * * * of the character or quality\u201d of the goods to which the mark is applied.</p>\n<p id=\"b1080-8\">Appellant contends that the expression \u201cVaper Marcel\u201d is only suggestive of \u201csome real or fancied function of a hair waving pad\u201d and is in no wise descriptive of appellant\u2019s hair waving pad.</p>\n<p id=\"b1080-9\">Appellant concedes in its application that its mark is applied to \u201chair waving pads.\u201d It appears that the pads to which appellant\u2019s mark is applied carry chemicals which, upon being moistened, generate heat to cause a waving solution to vaporize, which vapor is utilized in producing marcel waves.</p>\n<p id=\"b1080-10\">It is obvious to us that if appellant\u2019s merchandise is properly described as hair waving pads, as appellant concedes, then the mark \u201cVaper Marcel\u201d merely describes a particular kind of hair waving for which the pads are used, viz., in producing marcel waves utilizing vapor in the process, and therefore such mark, when used upon hair waving pads, would not indicate to purchasers the origin of such pads in appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b1080-11\">If the expression \u201cVaper Marcel\u201d applied to hair waving pads is not descriptive of the character of such pads, then the term \u201chair waving\u201d would likewise not be descriptive of the pads, for in each case the name applied is descriptive of use only. We think appellant would hardly contend \u2019that the expression \u201chair waving\u201d would not be a descriptive mark if applied to appellant\u2019s pads.</p>\n<p id=\"b1080-12\">Appellant has cited a number of trademark cases decided by this court upon the subject of descriptive marks, none of which in our opinion are applicable to the case before us. However, we do consider the case of Walgreen Co. v. Godefroy Mfg. Co., 74 F.2d 127, 129, 22 C.C.P.A., Patents, 818, as analogous in principle to the case at bar. That case involved the registrability of the word \u201cPeaudouce\u201d for use on \u201cskin cream.\u201d The term \u201cPeaudouce\u201d is a combination of the French words \u201cpeau\u201d and \u201cdouce,\u201d and the combination of the words means \u201csoft skin.\u201d In concluding our opinion in that case we said:</p>\n<p id=\"b1080-13\">\u201cIn view of the facts of record, we are of opinion that the trade-mark \u2018Peaudouce\u2019' is merely descriptive of the intended purpose and function of the goods on which it is used, and is therefore merely descriptive of the \u2018qualities, ingredients, or characteristics\u2019 of such goods; that, when so used, it is not subject to exclusive trademark appropriation; and that appellee\u2019s registration No. 250,012 is invalid and should be canceled. * * * \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1080-14\">Appellant contends that the combination of the words \u201cVaper Marcel\u201d is not found in the dictionary. It is of course conceded that the notation \u201cvaper\u201d means the same as does the word \u201cvapor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1080-15\">Because appellant has combined two common English words, which in combination are not found in the dictionaries, is wholly immaterial. In re Bailey Meter Company, 102 F.2d 843, 26 C.C.P.A., Patents, 1136.</p>\n<p id=\"b1080-16\">Here the expression \u201cVaper Marcel\u201d clearly informs purchasers of appellant\u2019s pads of the use to which they are to be put.</p>\n<p id=\"b1080-17\">In the case of Winchester Repeating Arms Co. v. Peters Cartridge Company, 30 App.D.C. 505, there was involved the registrability of the words \u201cSelf-Loading\u201d as a trade-mark for cartridges. The court held the \u00a1words to be .descriptive and in its opinion stated: \u201c * * * Moreover, it is perfectly apparent from an examination of the record that appellant selected these words and, attempted to trademark them because they aptly informed the trade of the purpose for which its goods are made and of the use to which they are to be put. * * * \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1080-18\">So in the case at bar, it is clear to us that appellant selected the expression \u201cVa-per Marcel\u201d and attempted to trade-mark <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1023\">*1023</page-number>it because it \u201captly informed the trade of the purpose for which its goods are made and of the use to which they are to be put.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1081-5\">We deem further discussion unnecessary. We are clear that the decision of the commissioner should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1081-6\">Appeal No. 4479.</p>\n<p id=\"b1081-7\">As indicated in the beginning of this opinion, the only difference between the mark involved in this appeal and that involved in Appeal No. 4475 is the arrangement of the expression \u201cVaper Marcel\u201d in what is termed in the application an \u201cartistic design.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1081-8\">In view of our holding in Appeal No. 4475 that the expression \u201cVaper Marcel\u201d is descriptive, it is clear that the mark involved in this appeal is not registrable. There is no disclaimer of the expression \u201cVaper Marcel\u201d as shown in the mark applied for. Furthermore, we do not think one may secure the registration of a descriptive mark by arranging the letters in a distinctive way. That question, however, is not before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b1081-9\">For the reasons herein stated, the decision of the Commissioner of Patents in each of the appeals before us, Nos. 4475 and 4479, is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1081-10\">Affirmed,</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
