An examination of the original brief discloses such to be a fact, and it is due counsel for appellant that correction be made in that regard. Our former decision having been printed in various publications, the most convenient method of correcting it appears to be by this supplemental opinion. The statement above quoted may be treated as withdrawn. \u2022</p>\n<p id=\"b994-21\">This action, however, has no effect upon the conclusion originally reached by us as to the actual merits of appellant\u2019s case, it being our view that the tribunals below did correctly define the disclosure of the Bain et al. patent.</p>\n<p id=\"b994-22\">The other points presented in the petition for rehearing have been given careful study, but they present no ground upon which we feel that appellant could properly be granted the patent he seeks.</p>\n<p id=\"b994-23\">The petition is denied, we adhering to the conclusion originally reached.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
