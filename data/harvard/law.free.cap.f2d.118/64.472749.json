The District Judge, in dismissing the complaint, adopted the opinion-report, findings of fact and legal conclusions of a Special Master, to whom he had referred the cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-27\">The Findings of Fact</p>\n<p id=\"b124-28\">The Special Master found that since 1895 the appellant company, whose president\u2019s father was its founder, has manufactured and distributed to some extent in thirty-seven states of th.e Union \u2014 although the great bulk of sales were made in Michigan, Ohio and Indiana, with Michigan sales predominating \u2014 the brand of cigars in controversy \u201ceither under the mark \u2018Champion\u2019 or \u2018Hemmeter\u2019s Champion\u2019 (it being sharply contested between the parties as to which of these has been used as its mark)\u201d; that, quite clearly, the appellant has been using its mark in interstate commerce; and that the registration of the trade-mark \u201cis now in force.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b124-29\">The Master found further that appellant has built up in the territory of distribution considerable goodwill attributable to the quality of its \u201cChampion\u201d Cigars and to diversified advertising, including counter displays, window streamers, billboards, and radio and newspaper advertisements, of which last mentioned the most recent were \u201cbuilt around a sport motif, the similarity between champions in athletics and Champion Cigars having been stressed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b124-30\">In recent years, appellant made some effort to expand its sales westward, but with small success. Appellant manufactures two other brands of full-size cigars and two brands of small cigars, but the marketing of these off brands has been quite limited.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-31\">In most of its advertisements, the two words, \u201cHemmeter\u2019s Champion,\u201d have been combined, but a foil card issued in various <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>color combinations for window display and distributed prior to 1932 bore the single slogan, \u201cEnjoy a Champion 5$S Cigar.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b125-5\">According to the Master, \u201cthe evidence indicates\u201d that the cigar has been known to customers \u201cin the wholesale jobbing trade and in the retail field as well as to the consuming public by several names, including \u2018Hemmeter\u2019s Champion,\u2019 \u2018Hemmeter\u2019s,\u2019 \u2018Champion,\u2019 and \u2018Champs.\u2019 \u201d Conceding conflicting testimony of retailers and consumers, the Master infers that \u201cgenerally speaking,\u201d the cigars \u201care called for by the full name \u2018Hemmeter\u2019s Champion,\u2019 or \u2018Champion\u2019 and very rarely by the contraction \u2018Champ\u2019 or \u2018Champs.\u2019 \u201d The record contains numerous orders received by appellant, chiefly from jobbers, for \u201cChamp\u201d or \u201cChamps,\u201d but the cigars have never been advertised under such names.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-6\">The appellant bases its cause of action against the appellee company, a subsidiary of one of the leading cigar manufacturers of the United States, upon the use by appellee of the word \u201cChamps\u201d in connection with a brand known as \u201cPortina Champs,\u201d imported from Porto Rico and first marketed in the summer of 1936 as an addition to a complete line of Portina cigars, widely distributed throughout the south.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-7\">According to the testimony of the vice-president of appellee company \u201cPortina Champs\u201d were put upon the market to meet the increased demand, since the depression of 1929, for cheap machine-made cigars, packed several to the carton. The witness asserted that the selection of the name \u201cChamps\u201d was made without knowledge of the existence of appellant\u2019s product and that the registry of trade-marks was not checked, because the term \u201cChamps\u201d was to be confined to use as a \u201cfrontmark,\u201d which is a kind of grade-mark to denote the shape and size of a cigar.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-8\">The Master considered this testimony \u201cconvincing\u201d and found \u201cas a conclusion of fact that defendant [appellee] had no intention (other than the constructive intent which might arise from its failure to make an adequate investigation of existing trade-marks on cigars) to simulate the plaintiff\u2019s [appellant\u2019s] trade-mark or style of packaging, or to capitalize on the goodwill created by the sale of plaintiff\u2019s cigar.\u201d He added that the packages of the contending parties bear <em>no remote resemblance </em>and he deemed it \u201cunlikely\u201d that a cigar company of the \u201cmagnitude\u201d of appellee, \u201cin bringing out a brand for national distribution, should deliberately name and design it in such a way as to steal the goodwill of a relatively small company whose business is largely confined to one state.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b125-11\">Appellee\u2019s Portina Champs are small-size cigars or \u201cCheroots.\u201d They are machine-processed, with an unfinished wrapper of tobacco leaf and are packed in units of five in a paper and cellophane wrapper, with the\u2019brand name \u201cPortina Champs\u201d imprinted in red and white on paper with a brown background. These cigar packages are enclosed in a red cardboard container, on the outside cover of which appear the words \u201cPortina Champs,\u201d the word \u201cChamps\u201d being distinctively set off in letters of smaller size and different style from the printing of \u201cPortina.\u201d On the cover of the paper container are displayed five athletic figures: a baseball player, a polo player, a golf player, a tennis player and a swimmer in the act of diving. There is also displayed the slogan, \u201c5 for 10.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b125-12\">The Special Master thus describes appellant\u2019s full-size cigar, which, in two different shapes, is retailed at five cents: \u201cIt is packed in cigar boxes of the usual size and shape with the name imprinted inside of the cover in large letters in a combination. of red, white and gold as \u2018Hemmeter\u2019s Champion,\u2019 the word \u2018Hemmeter\u2019s\u2019 being in a slightly larger and somewhat different style of type than \u2018Champion.\u2019 The same \u2018Hemmeter\u2019s Champion\u2019 also appears on both ends of the outside of the box in similar style; and also on three of the inner sides of the box, the \u2018Hemmeter\u2019s\u2019 being in type of the same size as \u2018Champion\u2019 and the words coming into view as cigars are withdrawn from the box. The cigar, itself, has been wrapped in a variety of ways over the period of its manufacture. At one time the words \u2018Hemmeter\u2019s Champion\u2019 were impressed upon the cigar itself, with no additional wrapping. For about the last two years, however, each cigar has been wrapped in foil with the word \u2018Champion\u2019 impressed in small letters on the foil. The cigar band bears the name, \u2018Hemmeter\u2019s Champion.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b125-13\">The Master thus concludes his findings of fact: \u201cNo evidence was submitted by plaintiffs in the trial of this cause of any actual instances of confusion of its customers, reliance being placed rather upon the alleged likelihood of confusion which the court might infer from the evidence as to the use of the respective marks by plain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>tiff and defendant and upon the results of an investigation made by special investigators hired by plaintiff. * * *\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b126-4\">The Law of the Case</p>\n<p id=\"b126-5\">I. It was the unsuccessful contention of appellee before the Master, repeated here, that the registered trade-mark of appellant is invalid for the reason that \u201cChampion\u201d -is a descriptive term, denoting the \u201ccharacter or quality\u201d of the product.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-6\">A similar contention was rejected by this court in Thomas G. Plant Co. v. May Co., 105 F. 375, in which it was held that the word \u201cQueen,\u201d used by a manufacturer of ladies\u2019 shoes to designate its product, is not essentially one which signifies quality, so as to preclude its appropriation as a trade name. It was pointed out that such words as \u201cKing,\u201d \u201cMonarch,\u201d \u201cKaiser,\u201d \u201cRoyal,\u201d \u201cVictor,\u201d \u201cKing Bee\u201d and \u201cPillsbury\u2019s Best\u201d have been judicially sanctioned as trade names.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-7\"> In our judgment, the word \u201cChampion\u201d plainly falls within the same category and may lawfully be appropriated as a trade-mark. Recognition of its validity has been accorded by the- United States Patent Office, and registration by the Patent Office raises a presumption of validity. Chapin-Sacks Mfg. Co. v. Hendler Creamery Co., 4 Cir., 254 F. 553, 556. Compare Hughes v. Alfred H. Smith Company, D.C., 205 F. 302, affirmed in 2 Cir., 209 F. 37, in which the word \u201cIdeal\u201d was held to be a valid trade-mark as applied to brushes.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-8\">II. Appellee submits that because the distribution of \u201cPortina Champs\u201d was exclusively <em>intrastate, </em>appellant has no cause of action for trade-mark infringement. The question seems academic, for the reason that in Hurn v. Oursler, 289 U. S. 238, 53 S.Ct. 586, 77 L.Ed. 1148, where a claim of copyright infringement was embraced in the same bill with a claim for unfair competition under state law, both claims being based on the same acts, the Supreme Court held that, although the federal copyright claim must be rejected on its merits, the federal court still had jurisdiction to decide the unfair competition claim on its merits, because a federal question had been raised on the pleadings.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-9\">The same situation is found here. Therer fore, jurisdiction should be retained to grant appropriate <em>relief; </em>not embracing any specific remedies provided by the Federal Act, but within the broad confines of the field left ppen by the express provision of the Act of 1905, Section 23, 15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 103, to the effect that \u201cNothing in this Act [subdivision of this chapter] shall prevent, lessen, impeach, or avoid any remedy at law or in equity which any party aggrieved by any wrongful use of any trademark might have had if the provisions of this Act [said subdivision] had not been passed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b126-11\">III. We are unable to concur in the legal conclusion of the Special Master, thus expressed: \u201cWhile certain advertising material put in evidence referred to \u2018Champion\u2019 alone and while it appears a large share of its customers call for the cigar by that name, it is difficult in view of the above facts to escape the conclusion that plaintiff\u2019s real mark is the compound word \u2018Hemmeter\u2019s Champion\u2019 rather than \u2018Champion\u2019 alone. The situation resembles that in Kellogg Toasted Corn Flake Co. v. Quaker Oats Co., 6 Cir., 235 F. 657, where it was held that, because of plaintiff\u2019s advertising, its mark was \u2018Kellogg Toasted Corn Flakes\u2019 rather than \u2018Toasted Corn Flakes,\u2019 although doubtless many customers called for the product without designating the maker\u2019s name. See also Spicer v. W. H. Bull Medicine Co., Cust. <em>&amp; </em>Pat.App.1931, 49 F.2d 980.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b126-13\">We find no true similarity between the facts found by the Master in the instant case and those described in the Kellogg-Quaker Oats case, supra. Unlike the word \u201cChampion,\u201d the expression \u201cToasted Com Flakes\u201d is descriptive of the product. When applied to thin flakes of white corn, toasted or browned by heat, the words were held not to be the subject of trade-mark. We have already shown on the authority of the Plant Company case, supra, that the word \"Champion,\u201d when applied to cigars, is a valid trade-mark. Furthermore, in the Toasted Corn Flakes case, the evidence was insufficient to show that the descriptive phrase had generally acquired such secondary meaning indicating Kellogg\u2019s product as to become a trade-mark.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-14\">In the case before us, the Master found as a matter of fact that a la\u00b0rge share of appellant\u2019s customers call for the cigar by the name \u201cChampion.\u201d The name, then, has become indicative of the origin of the cigar. It has acquired a secondary meaning indicating Hemmeter\u2019s goods, for which appellant has acquired a valuable goodwill resultant from the quality of its product and from diversified advertising.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>Where words have acquired a secondary meaning with respect to a man\u2019s merchandise, he is entitled to relief against anyone subsequently using the words in a manner likely to enable the later user to sell his wares as the product of the earlier. Computing Scale Company v. Standard Computing Scale Co., 6 Cir., 118 F. 965; Shaler Company v. Rite-Way Products Co., 6 Cir., 107 F.2d 82, affirming with modification, D.C., 19 F.Supp. 804.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-4\">In the other cases cited by the Master, the controversial words, \u201cHerbs and Iron,\u201d were also descriptive. Spicer v. W. H. Bull Medicine Co., Cust. &amp; Pat.App., 49 F.2d 980, 981. The Court of Customs Appeals said: \u201cWhen a customer \u00e1sked for a medicine as \u2018Herbs and Iron,\u2019 the druggist would understand him to make the inquiry in a descriptive sense, and the natural inquiry, where the druggist handled more than one such preparation, would be whether the customer desired \u2018Bull\u2019s\u2019 or \u2018Spicer\u2019s\u2019 or some other preparation of herbs and iron, of which there were a number on the market when the testimony herein was taken.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b127-5\">Counsel for appellee places much dependence upon Armour &amp; Co. v. Louisville Provision Co., 6 Cir., 283 F. 42, and upon the District Court opinion which it affirmed, 275 F. 92. The holding was that the evidence did not establish the adoption of the word \u201cStar\u201d as a trade-mark independently of the name of the corporation, \u201cArmour,\u201d with which it was used in combination, and consequently that the use of the words, \u201cSouthern Star,\u201d by another meat products packer did not infringe. The opinion of this court at page 45 of 283 F. \"declared, however, that the word \u201cStar\u201d or a symbol thereof \u201cshould be regarded as fanciful and as suggestive, rather than as purely descriptive, and thus as capable cf being made the subject of a valid trademark * * The Plant Company case, supra, and Menendez v. Holt, infra, were cited to support the text. It was stated that \u201cthe question whether plaintiff or its predecessor actually adopted as its trademark the word \u2018Star,\u2019 or a symbol thereof, as distinguished from a trade-mark \u2018Armour\u2019s Star,\u2019 is distinctly one of fact, the affirmative of which plaintiff has the burden of establishing. In our opinion, plaintiff has not sustained this burden.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b127-6\">Furthermore, it was printed cut in the District Court opinion that it had not been proved that the word \u201cStar\u201d had acquired a secondary meaning indicating origin of goods. 275 F. 92, 101.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-8\">In the record under review, there is abundant proof that the word \u201cChampion\u201d has acquired a secondary meaning indicating appellant\u2019s cigar.' The Master found that customers repeatedly order appellant\u2019s product by the sole designation \u201cChampion\u201d; he correctly concluded that the \u201cmark \u2018Champion\u2019 is not descriptive and was properly registered under the Act of 1905, 15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 81 et seq.\u201d; but, by a hiatus in logical reasoning, he deduced that appellant\u2019s \u201creal- mark is the compound word \u2018Hemmeter\u2019s Champion\u2019 rather than \u2018Champion\u2019 alone.\u201d The District Judge upheld him in this material error.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-9\">IV. It is insisted that, even if \u201cChampion\u201d is deemed a valid trade-mark, there has been no infringement or unfair competition by appellee. The entire substantive law of tr\u00e1de-marks is a branch of the broader law of unfair competition. Merriam Co. v. Saalfield, 6 Cir., 198 F. 369, 372; United Drug Co. v. Rectanus Co., 248 U. S. 90, 97, 39 S.Ct. 48, 63 L.Ed. 141. It will be convenient, therefore, to consider the question of trade-mark infringement along with the topic of unfair competition.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-10\">With reference to the authorities which we are about to cite or quote, we would repeat the words of this Court: \u201cReported cases are helpful only in so far as they lay down general rules of decision. The question of infringement must be determined upon the particular facts of the case in hand.\u201d Coca-Cola Co. v. Carlisle Bottling Works, 6 Cir., 43 F.2d 119, 121.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-11\">V. (1) In unfair competition, as also in violation of trade-mark rights, the essence of the wrong is the sale of the goods of one manufacturer or merchant for those of another. Hanover Star Milling Company v. Metcalf, 240 U.S. 403, 412, 413, 36 S.Ct. 357, 60 L.Ed. 713; Prestonettes, Inc. v. Coty, 264 U.S. 359, 368, 44 S.Ct. 350, 68 L.Ed. 731.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-12\">Consider the scintillant saying of Judge Learned Hand: \u201c* * * a reputation, like a face, is the symbol of its possessor and creator, and another can use it only as a mask. And so it has come to be recognized that, unless-the borrower\u2019s use is so foreign to the owner\u2019s as to insure against any identification of the two, it is unlawful.\u201d Yale Electric Corporation v. Robertson, 2 Cir., 26 F.2d 972, 974. Compare Del Monte Special Food Co. v. California <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>Packing Corporation, 9 Cir., 34 F.2d 774, 775.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-4\">In Western Oil Refining Co. v. Jones, 6 Cir., 27 F.2d 205, it was said: \u201cUpon the question of infringement, the test, as frequently announced by this court is whether the alleged infringing trademark or label, taken as a whole, so far resembles the other mark or label as to be likely to be mistaken for it by the casual or unwary purchaser.\u201d The previous decisions cited were Ohio Baking Co. v. National Biscuit Co., 6 Cir., 127 F. 116; W. A. Gaines &amp; Co. v. Turner-Looker Co., 6 Cir., 204 F. 553; and DeVoe Snuff Co. v. Wolff, 6 Cir., 206 F. 420, 423, 424. In the case last listed, it was asserted that \u201cit may be true that the.cautious and discriminating purchaser is not likely to be so misled; but the protection accorded to a trade-mark is not \u2018limited to the cautious and discriminating customer, but embraces the \u2018ordinarjd or \u2018unwary\u2019 purchaser as well.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b128-5\">Likewise, in Florence Manufacturing Co. v. J. C. Dowd &amp; Co., 2 Cir., 178 F. 73, 75, it was said: \u201cThe law is not made for the protection of experts, but for the public\u2014 that vast multitude which includes the ignorant, the unthinking, and the credulous, who, in making purchases, do not stop to analyze, but are governed by appearances and general impressions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b128-6\">In E. Kahn\u2019s Sons Co. v. Columbus Packing Co., 6 Cir., 82 F.2d 897, 900, unfair competition was found to exist in that the similarity of markings was considered \u201clikely to deceive the eye of ordinary purchasers, neither cautious nor discriminating, and lead them to believe that they were buying appellant\u2019s lard.\u201d See, also, De Nobili Cigar Co. v. Nobile Cigar Co., 1 Cir., 56 F.2d 324, 326, where it was stated that the origin of an article is indicated by the word which the evidence shows is employed in asking for and selling the article. The appearance of the package was deemed of minor importance for it was said many people \u201ccall for the goods who have never seen the package, or have forgotten its appearance, or are careless or indifferent of all save that they wish that particular cigar known as \u2018De Nobili.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b128-7\">The Circuit Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit has not minced words:- \u201cOne entering a field of endeavor already occupied by another should, in the selection of a trade-name or trade-mark, keep far enough away to avoid all possible confusion.\u201d Northam Warren Corporation v. Universal Cosmetic Co., 18 F.2d 774, 775. The court adjudged that there is infringement where \u201cone adopts a trade-name or a trade-mark so like another in form, spelling, or sound that one, with a not very definite or clear recollection as to the real trade-mark, is likely to become confused or misled.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b128-9\">To constitute unfair competition, the similarity of names need not be such as would actually deceive persons seeing the two commodities side by side. Ralston Purina Co. v. Western Grain Co., 5 Cir., 23 F.2d 253. Compare Vogue Company v. Thompson-Hudson Co., 6 Cir., 300 F. 509.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-10\">In the face of the sound reasoning of these authorities, the Master\u2019s conclusion on this record that \u201cthere is insufficient likelihood of confusion to entitle plaintiff to injunctive relief\u201d is manifestly incorrect. True, as he asserts, there is slight resemblance in the packages of the contending parties; and the cigars, as well as the packages, differ in size and shape. Were the packages placed side by side, there is scant likelihood that a customer of the appellant would become confused in his choice. But, as we have seen, that is not the test.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-11\">The Master says that \u201cno evidence was submitted by plaintiffs in the trial of this cause of any actual instances of confusion of its customers.\u201d We think, however, the testimony of two investigators employed by appellant to enter retail stores where cigars are.sold in Detroit and elsewhere and to \u201cask for some Champs\u201d revealed actual confusion among some retail dealers.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-12\">Proof positive of the certainty of confusion which must follow the use by appellee of the word \u201cChamps\u201d appears iii the testimony of one of appellee\u2019s witnesses, Dr. Howell L. Begle, a Detroit physician, who had smoked Plemmeter\u2019s Champion Cigars for thirty-five years. When asked, \u201cWhat would the word \u2018Champ\u2019 when applied to a cigar signify to you as to origin?\u201d, the doctor answered, \u201cI would catch myself using that term, and to me it would mean a flemmeter Champion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b128-13\">But, says the Master, \u201cthe term \u2018Champs\u2019 is never used by defendant alone but always in conjunction with and following \u2018Portina.\u2019 \u201d He stresses the obviously inapplicable decision of this court in Coca-Cola Co. v. Carlisle Bottling Works, 43 F.2d 119, in which it was held that \u201cRoxa Kola,\u201d when applied to a soft drink does not in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>fringe \u201cCoca-Cola.\u201d He ignores entirely the pertinent doctrine of Menendez v. Holt, 128 U.S. 514, 9 S.Ct. 143, 144, 32 L.Ed. 526, in which, where a firm of merchants had for years used as a trade-mark the words \u201cLa Favorita\u201d to designate flour selected by them, in the exercise of their best judgment, as equal to a certain standard, the Supreme Court held that the addition by an infringer of his name, in place of the owner\u2019s, to the trade-mark did not render such unauthorized use any less an infringement but on the contrary \u201cis an aggravation, and not a justification, for it is openly trading in the name of another upon the reputation acquired by the device of the true proprietor.\u201d See, also, Thomas G. Plant Co. v. May Company, 6 Cir., 105 F. 375, 378, supra, and Leonard et al. v. White\u2019s Golden Lubricator Co., C.C., 38 F. 922.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-5\">(2) In our opinion, the District Judge erred in approving the Master\u2019s holding that appellee has used the word \u201cChamps,\u201d not as a brand name for its cigars but \u201crather to designate one style or grade in the Portina line of cigars.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b129-6\">It is true that the owner of a trade-mark on a name cannot prohibit others from using that name as a grade mark to distinguish the quality of an article. Continental Corporation v. National Union Radio Corporation, 7 Cir., 67 F.2d 938; Columbia Mill Company v. Alcorn, 150 U. S. 460, 14 S.Ct. 151, 37 L.Ed. 1144. But, as we read the record in this case, there is no justification for the inference drawn by the Master and approved by the District Judge that the manner of usage by appellee of \u201cChamps\u201d classifies the word as a grade mark and not a trade-mark. Applying the principles of the cases which have been discussed, the reverse conclusion seems obvious. See, especially, Thomas G. Plant Co. v. May Co., supra, and cases there cited. See, also, Chesebrough Manufacturing Co. v. Old Gold Chemical Co., Inc., 6 Cir., 70 F.2d 383; and Ammon &amp; Person v. Narragansett Dairy Co., D.C., 252 F. 276 (affirmed in 1 Cir., 262 F. 880), in which the comment was made at page 278 of the opinion that \u201cneither subtractions from nor additions to a trade-mark proper will avoid infringement, when such imitation as is likely to lead to confusion still remains despite the changes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b129-7\">(3) Assuming that appellant has failed to prove that appellee had knowledge of the former\u2019s trade-mark \u2014 although information could have been easily acquired by inquiry at the patent office \u2014 and assuming further that it has not been shown that appellee intended to reap the benefit of appellant\u2019s goodwill by palming off its own product for that of appellee, an injunction should nevertheless be granted to protect appellee\u2019s trade-mark. As was said in O. &amp; W. Thum Co. v. Dickinson, 6 Cir., 245 F. 609, 615: \u201cIt is not necessary to the maintenance of a charge of infringement of a trade-mark to prove ,a distinct intent on the part of the infringer; it is the fact of infringement and the consequent invasion of the good w.ill and business of the owner of the mark that is controlling ; the intent will be presumed.\u201d See, also, De Voe Snuff Co. v. Wolff, 6 Cir., 206 F. 420, 424.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-11\">(4) We find ourselves in disagreement with the Master and the District Judge on another point. We think that protection should be afforded against confusion of potential future customers of the appellant. A trade-mark should not narrowly be limited to its precise present use by the owner, but room for reasonable expansion or alteration in the use of the mark should also be assured. Florence Mfg. Co. v. J. C. Dowd &amp; Co., 2 Cir., 178 F. 73; Barton Mfg. Co. v. Hercules Powder Co., Cust. &amp; Pat.App., 88 F.2d 708; Beech-Nut Packing Co. v. P. Lorillard Co., D.C., 299 F. 834; Peninsular Chemical Co. v. Levinson, 6 Cir., 247 F. 658; Western Oil Refining Co. v. Jones, 6 Cir., 27 F.2d 205.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-13\">While we have not agreed with the ultimate conclusions of the Special' Master, in which the District Judge concurred, we have been much aided by his well done opinion-report, which manifests his conscientious care and intelligent, painstaking effort.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-14\">(5) We recognize and approve the doctrine that the protection of a trademark should be limited to appropriate trade territory. General Baking Co. v. Goldblatt Bros., Inc., 7 Cir., 90 F.2d 241. Michigan, Ohio and Indiana seem, from the evidence, to constitute the entire trade territory which appellant can justly claim. Accordingly, an injunction limited in scope to these three states will be granted by the District Court, as prayed in paragraphs two to ten, inclusive, of the prayer of appellant\u2019s bill of complaint. There will be no accounting ordered as prayed in paragraph eleven, for the reason that no actual wrongful intent to injure appellant has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>been shown, and no substantial damage seems yet to have been inflicted upon appellant from the use by appellee of the trade-mark \u201cPortina Champs.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b130-4\">Let the decree be reversed and the cause remanded for .procedure in conformity with this opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
