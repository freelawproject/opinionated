Defendant is still so employed.\u201d The complaint then alleges that, from the sales of houses in Edgewood, defendant has derived commissions which but for his acts would have accrued to plaintiff, and that he has derived, or will derive unless he is prevented, additional commissions from the sales of other houses. It asks that defendant be enjoined from making further sales in Edgewood and required to account, as constructive trustee, for his commissions.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-26\">Rule 8(e) (2) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> expressly permits the pleading of alternatives, and provides that an alternative statement which would be sufficient if made independently is not vitiated by the insufficiency of other alternative statements. Appellant has pleaded four alternatives.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We think that, in connection with the rest of the complaint, the one which we have italicized states a claim on which relief can be granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number><em> </em>The allegations of the complaint are broad enough to permit proof that defendant was a fiduciary. An agent need not wait until he is on the street before he looks for other work. He may plan and prepare, during the agency, to engage in a competing business after it ceases.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> But his duty forbids him, during the agency, to ask his principal\u2019s customers to transfer their custom, even though the transfer is not to take effect until after the agency ceases.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Such conduct may seduce the agent from using his best efforts in his principal\u2019s behalf; for a transaction lost to the principal now may be a transaction gained by the agent later. It closely resembles dealing in the subject matter of the agency for the agent\u2019s own account, which is of course forbidden.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b72-4\">We need not consider whether appellant has asked for the proper relief. By Rule 54(c) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure \u201c <em>* </em>* * every final judgment shall grant the relief to which the party in whose favor it is rendered is entitled, even if'the party has not demanded such relief in his pleadings.\u201d Accordingly a complaint is sufficient if it sets forth facts which show that the plaintiff is entitled to any relief which the court can grant.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-5\">Reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b71-27\"> Emphasis supplied.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b71-28\"> 28 U.S.C.A. following section 723c.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"Aql\"> It might perhaps be questioned whether the pleading of all four in a single sen-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>fence meets the requirement of Rule 8 (e) (1) that \u201ceach averment of a pleading shall be simple, concise, and direct.\u201d Cf. Catanzaritti v. Bianco, D.C.M.D.Pa., 25 F.Supp. 457; Shell Petroleum Corporation v. Stueve, D.C.D.Minn., 25 F.Supp. 879. But this question seems to be answered in appellant\u2019s favor by Form 10 in the Appendix of Forms, 28 U.S.C.A. following section 723c.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b72-16\"> Myers v.
