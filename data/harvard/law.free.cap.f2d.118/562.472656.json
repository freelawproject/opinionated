We need not consider whether or not this second petition has been filed in compliance with our rules. It does, at least, serve to inform us that the time has come when we should ourselves modify the order in accordance with the views expressed in our opinion. It is accordingly modified to provide that the words \u201cCommercial Publishers of the Volume Library\u201d be used with the name of the corporation in carrying on its business and be so used that the nature of its business will be thus revealed. In the same way, and for the same purpose, petitioners who use the trade name \u201cEducators Association\u201d shall add to it the words, \u201cCommercial Distributors of the Volume Library.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b620-22\">In all other respects, our former decision is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-23\">Petition denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b620-24\">CLARK, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"AbT\">(dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b620-25\">I think the language herein suggested is inadequate to counteract the misleading implication from petitioners\u2019 name and style that they are an association of educators. Compare H. N. Heusner &amp; Son v. Federal Trade Commission, 3 Cir., 106 F.2d 596; El Moro Cigar Co. v. Federal Trade Commission, 4 Cir., 107 F.2d 429. Some such expression as \u201c(A Private Commercial Enterprise) Publisher of The Volume Library\u201d should be used with the name of the corporation in carrying on its business, and petitioners, who use the trade name \u201cEducators Association,\u201d should add to it the words: \u201cA Private Commercial Enterprise of Sales Agents of The Volume Library.\u201d</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
