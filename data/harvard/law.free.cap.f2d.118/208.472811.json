In 1935, by private act No. 107, 49 Stat.L. 2089, Congress conferred upon the District Court for the Northern District of California jurisdiction to hear, determine, and render judgment upon the claim of appellee against the Alaska Railroad for general and special damages. The act provided that the proceedings should be \u201cin the same manner as in the case of claims over which such court has jurisdiction under the first paragraph of paragraph 20 of section 24 of the Judicial Code, as amended.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b267-11\">In supposed compliance with that act appellee filed suit against the United States seeking damages in the amount of $55,000. The government moved to dismiss on the ground that the act authorized suit against the Alaska Railroad only, and on the further ground that the amount of the claim was in excess of the $10,000 limit prescribed in the Tucker Act (Judicial Code, \u00a7 24(20), 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 41(20), to which the private act referred. While the motion was pending Congress passed private act No. 384, 50 Stat.L. 1094,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> amendatory of the previous one, permitting appellee to sue the United States for damages growing out of her injury. Under the second of these statutes appellee brought the present suit, again seeking a recovery of $55,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-12\">After a trial without a jury the court below made findings in favor of appellee and rendered judgment against the United States for $10,231.75, with costs. On the appeal the government contends that the trial court lacked jurisdiction to entertain the suit, and that the evidence fails to support the finding of negligence in the operation of the train. Error is also predicated on the allowance of costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-13\">The report of the house committee on claims,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> which had the bill in charge, makes it abundantly clear that the com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>mittee intended to limit appellee\u2019s recovery to the amount of $10,000, as specified in the Tucker Act. Appellee so concedes and offers now to waive her judgment for the excess. But the government says that since the suit was for an amount exceeding $10,-000 the court was without jurisdiction to entertain it or to render judgment in any sum. We do not agree. At the time the special act was passed appellee had pending a suit for $55,000 damages and such was known to be the amount of her claim. By \u00a7 2 of the act jurisdiction was expressly conferred upon the District Court \u201cto hear, determine, and render judgment upon said claim, the subject of said action.\u201d The act conferred jurisdiction to entertain suit on the claim. Appellees\u2019 concession makes it unnecessary to consider whether we should construe the statute by reference to the committee report.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-4\">Appellee was 54 years of age at the time of her injury. While she was en route from Seward to Anchorage on a sightseeing trip she rose from her chair in the observation car and was about to turn it so as to get a better view of the scenery when she was thrown to the floor by the motion of the train. Upon examination at the railroad hospital at Anchorage she was found to have sustained a fracture of the femur. The train was a combination freight and passenger train consisting of six cars, including a passenger car and the observation car. The motion which caused the fall was variously described by appellee and other witnesses present as a \u201csevere lurch\u201d, \u201ca sudden lurch\u201d, \u201ca very severe jerk\u201d, and \u201can unusual jerk or lurch\u201d. Certain of the witnesses testified that they had not been conscious of similar movement up to that time. The porter, who was at the rear of the car, described the lurching or swaying of the train as of such character as to cause him to turn around at the moment appellee fell. Although the porter had previously made six round trips on the route he had never before noticed the swaying motion at that particular point. Other passengers standing at the time were compelled to grasp their chairs or to drop back into their seats and one of them was pitched against the side of the car.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-6\">The trial court applied the rule of res ipsa loquitur and found that the train was so negligently operated as to cause the car to sway, jerk, or lurch violently, throwing appellee to the floor and proximately causing her injury. It is true the crew testified that the train was at all times carefully handled, that its equipment was in good working order, and that there was no unusual lurching. Their testimony served merely to create a conflict. We assume it to be true, also, as appellant contends, that a carrier is not responsible for injuries to passengers resulting from the ordinary motions incident to the proper operation of a train. But the mere statement of that general proposition of law demonstrates its inapplicability here. Whether the motion of a train is of such nature as to constitute negligence is a question of fact. 10 Am.Jur. \u00a7 1343. In the light of the evidence it cannot be said that the finding of negligence was clearly erroneous. We do not believe it necessary to explore the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur. Enough to say that the findings below were well within the limits of the doctrine as generally applied. There is no merit in the argument that appellee was guilty of contributory negligence, as a matter of law, in arising from her chair. While other matters were argued we find nothing warranting a reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-7\">In the course of the argument here, as above stated, counsel for appellee waived the amount of the judgment in excess of $10,000. He waived also, costs awarded below.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b268-8\">The judgment is ordered reduced to $10,-000.
