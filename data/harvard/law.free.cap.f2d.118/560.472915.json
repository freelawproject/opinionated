We think that construction of the act too narrow. The jurisdiction retained is over matters which arise touching the extension agreement until its complete fulfillment. The court would have no occasion to enforce the terms of the agreement till there was a failure to perform them, which might occur on the last moment of the period of extension. The court has jurisdiction to cause the extension agreement to be performed by both sides, although the period of extension may have expired before the court applies the proper remedy.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-10\">The motion is overruled.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
