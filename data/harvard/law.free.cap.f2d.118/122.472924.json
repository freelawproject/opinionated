Bremer, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>trading as H. E. Bremer Manufacturing Company, the Herzfeld-Phillipson Company, a corporation, Western Hardware and Specialty Company, a corporation, and Steam-O-Matic Corporation, to enjoin the infringement of Design Patent No. D-112,-129, the infringement of plaintiff\u2019s trademark \u201cSteem-Electric\u201d registered November 20, 1937, under the Trade-Mark Act of February 20, 1905, 15 U.S.C.A., \u00a7\u00a7 81-109, and again April 25, 1939, under the TradeMark Act of 1920, 15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 121 et seq., and for unfair competition.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-4\">Counsel for the plaintiff, at the conclusion ,Jof the hearing, conceded non-infringement of the design patent, and the court, by judgment, entered November 24, 1939, dismissed the complaint for want of equity. The appeal was taken from the order of dismissal as to all defendants except Bremer. The judgment of dismissal as to him is therefore not before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-5\">The product in suit, around which the charge of trade-mark infringement and unfair competition revolves, is a steam electric or electric steam iron, which, as the name indicates, is heated by electricity and generates steam from water contained in a chamber within the iron. This iron is thus distinguished from an electric iron heated by electricity, but which operates without steam, as well as the old-fashioned iron which receives its heat by contact with an outwardly hot object.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-6\">In plaintiff\u2019s first registered trade-mark, the words \u201cSteem-Electric\u201d are disclosed in combination with a design showing lightning flashes adjacent to the word \u201cElectric\u201d and a cloud of escaping steam adjacent to the word \u201cSteem\u201d. In this registration appears this disclaimer: \u201cNo claim is made to the words \u2018Steem-Electric\u2019 apart from the mark.\u201d The second registration merely designated the words \u201cSteem-Electric.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b182-8\">The plaintiff, about three years prior to the starting of suit, commenced and subsequently .has been engaged in the manufacture and sale of household steam-electric irons under its trade-mark name of \u201cSteem-Electric.\u201d The defendant, Steam-O-Matic Corporation, shortly thereafter, commenced and subsequently has been engaged in the manufacture and sale of a similar iron under its trade-name of \u201cSteam-O-Matic.\u201d These irons are assembled for the defendant, Steam-O-Matic Corporation, by the defendant, Western Hardware and Specialty Manufacturing Company. The defendant, the Herzfeld-Phillipson Company (commonly known as the \u201cBoston Store\u201d in Milwaukee, Wisconsin), is a retail dealer selling the \u201cSteam-O-Matic\u201d iron. The controversy, therefore, is largely between the plaintiff and the Steam-O-Matic Corporation.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-10\">The essential issue in dispute is whether the plaintiff\u2019s trade-mark \u201cSteem-Electric\u201d has acquired a secondary meaning as indicating the plaintiff\u2019s product, and, if so, whether it is infringed by the defendant\u2019s trade-mark \u201cSteam-O-Matic.\u201d A corollary to this- issue is whether the defendants are guilty of unfair competition. As bearing upon the latter issue, the contention is made that the defendant, in the production of its iron, employs a stippled finish which is characteristic of the plaintiff\u2019s iron.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-11\">Plaintiff, in support of its position, relies largely upon Armstrong Paint &amp; Varnish Works v. Nu-Enamel Corporation, 305 U. S. 315, 59 S.Ct. 191, 83 L.Ed. 195, affirming a decision of this court. 7 Cir., 95 F.2d 448. On the other hand, Steam-O-Matic Corporation (hereinafter referred to as the \u201cdefendant\u201d) places equal emphasis upon Kellogg Company v. National Biscuit Company, 305 U.S. 111, 59 S.Ct. 109, 83 L.Ed. 73. As might be expected, the plaintiff endeavors to distinguish the latter, and the defendant the former case. Before considering these authorities and others relied upon by the respective parties, it seems appropriate to give a brief resum\u00e9 of the facts as they appear in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-12\"> Many witnesses were heard, some in person and others by deposition, which evidence the plaintiff argues establishes without question, the secondary meaning of plaintiff\u2019s trade-mark, infringement by the defendant and unfair competition. It would unduly prolong our opinion to refer to such testimony in detail. As the defendant points out, all the testimony bearing upon these issues had to do with incidents occurring subsequent to the commencement of the suit. Also, the testimony came largely, if not entirely, from paid investigators employed by the plaintiff to obtain evidence, and from wholesale and retail dealers who were agents for the sale and distribution of plaintiff\u2019s iron. While, no doubt, testimony obtained subsequent to the commencement of the suit was properly admissible, yet we are of the opinion that its weight was, to some extent, impaired. Likewise not controlling, but of some significance, is the fact that not a single bona <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>fide customer for plaintiff\u2019s iron testified in behalf of the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-5\">The testimony of the wholesale dealers was largely to the effect that to them the trade-mark \u201cSteem-Electric\u201d designated an iron manufactured by the plaintiff. Typical of such testimony is that of the witness Stern, buyer for a department store of . Hartford, Connecticut.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-6\">\u201cQ. When you see the trade-name, Steem-Electric Iron, does it indicate any particular manufacturer to you? A. It definitely does. It indicates the make of irons manufactured by the Steem-Electric Corporation of St. Louis, Missouri.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b183-7\">Retail dealers gave similar testimony, and generally stated that in ordering plaintiff\u2019s iron, they designated it as \u201cSteemElectric.\u201d Typical of such testimony is that of the witness Thompson, buyer for a New York Department Store.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-8\">\u201cQ. When you buy this product, what do you ask for? A. Steem-Electric Irons.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-9\">\u201cQ. And why is that? A. That\u2019s what it is, so far as I know.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b183-10\">There is also testimony to the effect that when consumers wanted the plaintiff\u2019s product they called for \u201cSteem-Electric\u201d irons. Demonstrators at department stores testified that prospective customers inquired and talked about the \u201cSteem-Electric\u201d iron. A member of a team who had conducted a radio program for the plaintiff, testified to receiving 6000 letters referring to plaintiff\u2019s iron, and that ninety to ninety-five per cent of them spelled the word \u201csteam\u201d as \u201cSteem.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b183-11\">Assuming that plaintiff\u2019s testimony in this respect furnishes some support for its contention that the trade-mark \u201cSteem-Electric\u201d carried a secondary meaning, it must be remembered that its dealers and agents, exclusively engaged in purchasing and selling its product, would naturally associate with plaintiff the product sold under its trade-name. It does not follow that the public or any considerable portion thereof would be thus impressed. It is also important to observe that many of plaintiff\u2019s witnesses \u2014 in fact, 26 out of 30\u2014 admitted, in effect, that the words \u201cSteemElectric\u201d were descriptive of the product rather than the producer. Typical of such testimony is that of the witness Berman:</p>\n<p id=\"b183-12\">\u201cQ. If you were going to specify a household electric steaming iron made by some company other than the Steem-Electric Corporation of St. Louis, Missouri, would you use the name \u2018Steem-Electric\u2019? A. Yes.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-13\">\u201cQ. In order to differentiate from the ordinary electric iron, of which you have thirty-five other makes, and when you are talking about one of the irons like the plaintiff\u2019s, it is almost necessary to use the word \u2018Steam\u2019 is it not? A. That\u2019s right.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b183-14\">Also, the witness Berstein:</p>\n<p id=\"b183-15\">\u201cQ. Then wouldn\u2019t you say that an iron which is heated electrically, and which discharges steam must be designated as a steam electric iron to differentiate it from an ordinary non-steam electric iron? A. Yes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b183-16\">It is not disputed but that prior to the time that plaintiff commenced the manufacture of its iron, there were a number of irons on the market electrically heated and steam generating. They were, as a class, commonly designated as the steam-electric, or electric-steam iron. A number of such irons were covered by patents, one of which, Kako Patent No. 1,347,224, entitled \u201cElectric Steam Iron\u201d expired prior to the time that plaintiff entered this field.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-17\">The first and foremost legal question presented is whether plaintiff\u2019s trade-mark \u201cSteem-Electric\u201d acquired a secondary meaning as indicating the plaintiff\u2019s product. The District Court in this respect made the following finding of fact [29 F.Supp. 1011, 1012]: \u201cIn view of the descriptiveness of plaintiff\u2019s mark, and in view of the prior and common uses of similar terms, as set forth in paragraph 12 above, plaintiff\u2019s alleged mark \u2018Steem Electric\u2019 cannot and has not acquired a \u2018secondary meaning.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In fact, plaintiff states that the present appeal is largely from this finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-19\">Before deciding this question, we refer to defendant\u2019s contention that the plaintiff is precluded from use of the mark \u201cSteem-Electric\u201d because of its unqualified disclaimer of such words in its first trademark registration. We do not think this argument is sound for the reason that the plaintiff has the common-law right to its trade-mark if otherwise valid, irrespective of registration. Armstrong Paint &amp; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>Varnish Co. v. Nu-Enamel Corporation, supra; United States Ozone Company et al. v. United States Ozone Company of America, <em>7 </em>Cir., 62 F.2d 881, 885. If its right in this respect is not dependent upon registration, it would seem to follow that the disclaimer could not be utilized as an estoppel. At the same time, we think it is reasonable to assume that the reason for the disclaimer was recognition on the part of the plaintiff, hnd perhaps the patent office as well, that the disclaimed words were merely descriptive of a product in common use and, therefore, could not be protected by trade-mark. If this assumption is correct, the disclaimer is inconsistent with the plaintiff\u2019s present position and increases its burden in establishing the validity of its mark. In this connection, it is pertinent to point out that the defendant is only charged with infringement of the trademark \u201cSteem-Electric,\u201d as there is no contention that it uses such words in connection with the electric flashes and clouded effect as shown in the plaintiff\u2019s first registration.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-4\">That the words \u201cSteam-Electric\u201d are descriptive as designating a product long in use and as manufactured and sold by many concerns, both prior and subsequent to the time of plaintiff\u2019s entry into this field, is forcibly demonstrated by this record. Can plaintiff, by changing one letter in the word \u201csteam\u201d so as to make it read \u201csteem\u201d make it any less descriptive? It is our view that the answer must be in the negative.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-5\">It would serve no useful purpose to attempt to review and distinguish what the courts have said in dealing with situations of this character. A study of such cases is rather convincing that each case must stand upon its own facts. At this point, however, we refer to Standard Paint Company v. Trinidad Asphalt Company, 220 U.S. 446, 31 S.Ct. 456, 55 L.Ed. 536. There the court held that the word \u201crubberoid\u201d being a descriptive word, was none-the-less descriptive when spelled \u201cruberoid\u201d and that the latter could not be appropriated as a trade-mark. ' The court used language pertinent to the instant situation, when, on page 455 of 220 U.S., on page 458 of 31 S.Ct., 55 L.Ed. 536, it said: \u201c* * * The word, therefore, is descriptive, not indicative of the origin or the ownership of the goods; and, being of that quality, we cannot admit that it loses such quality and becomes arbitrary by being misspelled. Bad orthography has not yet become so rare or so easily detected as to make a word the arbitrary sign of something else than its conventional meaning, as different, to bring the example to the present case, as the character of an article is from its origin or ownership.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b184-7\">It must not be overlooked, however, that while the court denied the effect of a trademark to a descriptive name, it was not considering a situation where such name had acquired a secondary meaning. This was pointed out in a footnote (305 U.S. page 335, 59 S.Ct. page 201, 83 L.Ed. page 207) in Armstrong Paint &amp; Varnish Company v. Nu-Enamel Corporation, supra. In fact, the court in the latter case recognized plaintiff\u2019s trade-mark as descriptive of the product there in issue. So we think it must be concluded that the mere fact that a trade-name is descriptive is not sufficient to invalidate it.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-8\">Its validity depends upon whether it has acquired a secondary meaning \u2014 that is, if, in the minds of the public, it means the producer rather than the product. While it is not easy to distinguish some of the language employed in the Nu-Enamel case from Kellogg Company v. National Biscuit Company, supra, we are of the opinion that the basic distinction, and that which was largely determinative of the court\u2019s conclusion in the Nu-Enamel case, was the concession of the defendant that \u201cNu-Enamel\u201d had acquired the meaning of the plaintiff\u2019s products and that it was a mark which distinguished such products from others of the same class. In the instant case, where no such concession was made, we must determine whether plaintiff has sustained the burden of establishing a secondary meaning for its trade-name. On this question, we think the Kellogg case comes near being conclusive. Plaintiff argues that the proof in the case at bar discloses a secondary meaning and that it is thus distinguishable from the Kellogg case. We do not believe this argument is tenable. In the Kellogg case, the. court, on page 118, of 305 U.S., on page 113 of 59 S.Ct., 83 L.Ed. 73, said: \u201c* * * There is no basis here for applying the doctrine of secondary meaning. The evidence shows only that due to the long period in which the plaintiff or its predecessor was the only manufacturer of the product, many people have come to associate the product, and as a consequence the name by which the product is generally known, with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>plaintiff\u2019s factory at Niagara Falls. But to establish a trade name in the term \u2018shredded wheat\u2019 the plaintiff must show more than a subordinate meaning which applies to it. It must show that the primary significance of the term in the minds of the consuming public is not the product but the producer. This it has not done. * * \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b185-5\">In the Kellogg case, the proof in this respect was more favorable to the plaintiff than here. There the name in controversy had been used by the plaintiff and its predecessor exclusively for many years, while here the name had only been used by plaintiff for a comparatively short time, and at the time of its adoption, was a common term. Here the amount spent in advertising plaintiff\u2019s trade-name was infinitesimal in comparison with that expended in the Kellogg case. In the instant case, the most that can be said for plaintiff\u2019s proof is that its trade-name carries a \u201csubordinate meaning\u201d in the minds of the consuming public, rather than one of \u201cprimary significance\u201d. In fact, as already pointed out, the record is barren of evidence coming from the consuming public as to its reaction in relation to plaintiff\u2019s trade-name.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-6\">Also, in the Kellogg case, the court stressed the fact that plaintiff\u2019s patent, upon the product to which the term in dispute applied, had expired, and that, thereupon, there passed to the public the right to make the article as well as the right to apply thereto the name by which the article had become known. A somewhat similar situation is presented here. As already pointed out, at least one patent upon a steam-electric iron had expired. With such expiration the monopoly ceased, and any member of the public had a right to manufacture and sell, not only the product covered by the patent, but under the name by which it was therein described.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-7\">The court below found that plaintiff\u2019s trade-mark \u201ccan not and has not acquired a secondary meaning.\u201d There is no occasion for us to decide the possibility of such acquirement. It is sufficient to conclude that it has not, and to that extent, we approve of the court\u2019s finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-8\">Furthermore, we are of the opinion that even though plaintiff has a valid trade-mark, it has not been infringed by the defendant. Defendant\u2019s trade-name, \u201cSteam-O-Matic\u201d, is readily distinguishable from the term \u201cSteem-Electric\u201d both when written and spoken. It is difficult to believe that the public, assuming that its sensibilities are so keen as to recognize a \u201cSteemElectric\u201d iron as being the product of the plaintiff, would not, at the same time, recognize a \u201cSteam-O-Matic\u201d iron as coming from a different source. To hold that the defendant is precluded from the use of the word \"steam\u201d in its trade-name is to say that it can not use a generic word descriptive of its product.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-11\">Plaintiff points to the confusion occasioned by the alleged similarity of defendant\u2019s trade-name. There is some proof in this respect, but it does not follow that it was the result of the name employed by the defendant. In fact, we are of the opinion that such confusion as was shown was the result of the adoption by the plaintiff of a term, not only descriptive of its product, but one long employed by the public in describing the same product manufactured and sold by others.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-12\">Plaintiff, as we understand its argument, also claims that it is entitled to prevail on the grounds of unfair competition, and this, irrespective of the validity of its trade-mark or infringement thereof. While unfair competition, no doubt, may exist independently of trade-mark infringement, yet \u201cthe facts supporting a suit for infringement and one for unfair competition are substantially the same.\u201d Armstrong Paint &amp; Varnish Co. v. Nu-Enamel Corporation, supra [305 U.S. 315, 59 S.Ct. 196, 83 L.Ed. 195], There is, however, some testimony in the instant case which has a bearing upon the charge of unfair competition, which we do not think is material to the infringement issue. A number of witnesses gave testimony to the effect that the stippled finish on the plaintiff\u2019s iron distinguished it from other irons, and plays a material part in its identification by the public. In our view, plaintiff\u2019s position in this respect is without merit. As already stated, in the beginning this suit charged the defendants named in the complaint with infringement of a certain design patent issued to Ernest F. Pohl. The court below found with reference to this patent: \u201cThe design, as shown and claimed in Pohl patent in suit No. D-112,-129, was invented by the defendant Harry Bremer, and Ernest F. Pohl.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b185-15\">Ernest F. Pohl, President of the plaintiff corporation, assigned this patent to the corporation. The defendant, in the court below, as here, urged that the complaint be dismissed on the ground that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>plaintiff was in court with unclean hands. The contention as made there, and pressed here, was that Pohl, in obtaining this patent, knowingly made a false affidavit that he was the sole inventor, when, as a matter of fact, the invention was that of Harry E. Bremer. We have studied the testimony bearing upon this issue and are of the opinion that the District Court dealt charitably with Pohl in giving him credit as a joint inventor. It is possible, however, that he might have been innocently mistaken, and we therefore conclude that the defense of unclean hands should not prevail.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-4\">Accepting the situation as found, it is difficult to see how plaintiff is entitled to exclusive rights in the so-called stippled finish. This stippled or hammered finish was common on aluminum castings and had been used extensively on various kinds of kitchen wares. Bremer had long used it, and in the design patent the stippled finish is shown \u2014 in fact, it is the most distinguishing feature of the design. Bremer, for some time, was employed by the plaintiff in the production of this stippled-fi'nished product used in connection with its iron. For some reason not material, Bremer severed his connection with the plaintiff and commenced supplying the stippled product to the defendant, Western Hardware and Specialty Company, associated with the defendant, Steam-.OMatic Corporation, in the manufacture and assembly of its iron. Under such circumstances, it is not strange that plaintiff conceded non-infringement of the design patent and failed to appeal from the order dismissing its complaint as to Bremer. It appears there could be no question but that Bremer, as a joint inventor, had equal rights with the plaintiff as to the design disclosed by the patent. It would seem to be axiomatic that in utilizing that design, he could not be successfully charged with unfair competition, and certainly not infringement. His rights in this respect, however, would be futile unless he could manufacture and sell the stipple-finished metal. If Bremer had this right, which we think he did, it must follow that the defendants who purchased such metal from him, would not be liable for unfair competition by its use.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-5\">We therefore conclude that the defendant has the right to manufacture and sell its iron under the trade-name employed, and with the stippled finish. Under the Kellogg case, however (pages 118, 119 and 120 of 305 U.S., 59 S.Ct. 109, 83 L.Ed. 73), it appears that this right is limited by its obligation to use reasonable care to inform the public as to the identity of its product. The testimony' supports the following finding: \u201c* * * The plaintiff\u2019s iron is much heavier than defendants\u2019 iron; there is a marked difference in the shape and appearance of the two irons; plaintiff\u2019s iron is sold in a predominantly red carton; defendants\u2019 iron is sold in a plain craft package with blue lettering. Defendants, in their advertising on the cartons and otherwise, do not use anything resembling plaintiff\u2019s cloud effect and lightning flashes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b186-8\">Plaintiff\u2019s iron, as well as defendants\u2019, together with the respective cartons in which they are packed and sold, are here as physical exhibits. An .inspection discloses no similarity between the cartons and it appears that the irons are as dissimilar in size, shape, weight and design as could be expected, considering the,fact that all irons, so far as we are aware, have a similarity common to that product. We are of the opinion that the defendant exercised reasonable care so that its product would not be palmed off on the public as that of the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-9\">It is our view that the District Court was not in error in dismissing plaintiff\u2019s complaint, and its judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b183-20\"> Paragraph 12 cites a number oh companies which have adopted and used the term \u201cSteam Electric Iron\u201d prior to the adoption of the term \u201cSteem-Electric\u201d by the plaintiff.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
