It also appeared that the corner of the plaintiff\u2019s wharf projected over the defendant\u2019s eastern boundary line protracted, and so intervened between his wharf and the channel of the river.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AeR\">The jury were instructed, with respect to the first issue, that they should find whether the plaintiff, or his ancestor, had a right to extend his wharf when it was extended, and also whether he has since acquired a right to enjoy his extension. Upon the first of these questions it was contended by the plaintiff, that he had a right to go below low-water mark, because it did not appear that such an extension was a public nuisance but the jury were instructed, that if they should find it was na a public nuisance, still if they should find it was a private nuisance injurious to the defendant and those under whom he claims, the extension was unlawful in respect to him, and this part of the issue should be found for the defendant; that if they should so find on the first question, then they would further find, whether the plaintiff now has a right to enjoy the extension, and as to this, in the opinion of the judge, they would have no doubt, upon the statute of 1837, c. 229, circumscribing the harbor of Boston. They were further instructed, that the second and third issues were so connected, that they might be considered together ; that if the jury found the extension of the plaintiff\u2019s wharf a wrongful injury, they would find the third issue for the defendant; that as to the defendant\u2019s right to extend his wharf, the matter in dispute was fifty-four feet towards the end ; that if they were of opinion that the extension by the defendant would be no injury to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>public, and no injury to the plaintiff, they might sustain the ground of the defendant; they might not perhaps find that the defendant had an absolute right under the act of 1837, but if the evidence would justify them, they might find that the defendant has a right to extend his wharf, so far as regards the plaintiff; that if they should find that the plaintiff\u2019s extension was no nuisance, then the main question to be considered was, whether the plaintiff had acquired a right to the fifty-four feet, over which the defendant had no right to extend his wharf; that prior occupancy of land is sufficient to give a right as against a mere stranger; that they were to consider whether this case came within that principle ; that the possession must be exclusive, and not joint or alternate, and the decision of the question would depend upon the question, whether the defendant had a right to use the water before the extension; that if he had, then the question would turn upon acquiescence ; that if a man erects a wharf and uses a dock twenty years, adverse possession would give him a right to the easement, on the presumption of a grant ; that in the c\u00e1se of owners upon a cove, one must not shut out another\u2019s access ; that one having no right, cannot build out in such a way below low-water mark, as to materially injure another; for instance, if the plaintiff had built an L in front of the defendant\u2019s wharf, it could not stand ; that if the plaintiff\u2019s extension was injurious to the defendant\u2019s property, unless there had been twenty years\u2019 acquiescence on the part of Parkman and those claiming under him, they might find that the defendant has a right to extend his wharf.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b197-4\">The jury found upon the <em>first </em>issue, that the plaintiff, or those under whom he claims, had no right to extend his wharf at the time he or they did, but that he now has a right to the wharf by the statute of 1837, so far as it does not infringe upon the direct line of the defendant\u2019s premises ; upon the third, that the extension of the plaintiff\u2019s wharf did injure the defendant; upon the second, that, so far as concerns the plaintiff, the defendant has a right to extend the wharf in the manner he claims to do ; upon the fourth, that Parkman had notice or knowledge of the extension of the plaintiff\u2019s wharf; and upon the <em>fifth, </em>that Parkman d\u2018d not object to the extension.</summary>\n<otherdate data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"b198-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>\n<em>March 28th.</em>\n</otherdate>\n<attorneys data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"Agy\"><em>J.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"ASf\">delivered the opinion of the Court. It appears to the Court very clear, that the extension by Mr. Gray, the plaintiff\u2019s ancestor, in 1816, of bis wharf into the channel below the line of low-water mark, whether it was a public nuisance or not, or whether in any form the public could have interposed to prevent or remove it, gave the builder no possession, and no color of title, beyond the limits of the land under water, actually covered by some erection which would m fact exclude the use of the public waters to others. Of coirse, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>it did not draw after it any exclusive right to the use of the open space by the side of it, for the purposes of wharfage, by way of easement as appurtenant to his wharf. Beyond the limits of his actual occupation, by building, the plaintiff\u2019s ancestor had a right, in common only with all others, to use the space on both sides of his wharf, for the purposes of passing over it with boats and vessels, and for mooring vessels upon, as all persons have a right to use open navigable waters.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-7\">The principle of prior occupancy by Mr. Gray, the ancestor of the plaintiff, and the acquiescence of the ancestors of the defendant, does not apply to any part of the premises in controversy, below low-water mark, because, as, to that the possession was not adverse, and Mr. Parkman, the defendant\u2019s ancestor, had no power to oppose or resist it. It was a public domain, over which Mr. Parkman had no control ; and his right to use it, was a right in common with all the rest of the community, and one which it was not his peculiar duty or province to vindicate.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-8\">A point mainly relied on is this, that when the elder Mr. Gray extended his wharf within and beyond low-water mark, which was a great public improvement, he covered the whole width of his flats, or nearly the whole, with his wharf; that it was essential to the enjoyment of his wharf, that he should make use of the adjoining flats for dockage ; and that the adjoining proprietor must have known and understood this, and by his silence tacitly acquiesced in this claim, and gave him permission so to occupy the adjoining flats. But the Court are of opinion that this is making much too broad a claim, upon the foundation of tacit acquiescence. When Mr. Gray built out his wharf from high to low water mark, he had a right to use and occupy his own flats to the full breadth, in any manner which he thought fit. He might use the flats solely for wharf or solely for docks, or partly for one and partly for the other. But he could not use the same flats for wharf and for docks at the same time. If therefore it was his intention to use the sides of his wharf, or either of them, for dock age to lay vessels upon, it was in his power to leave open a sufficient part of the flats for that purpose, and for access to them. His not doing so, was rather an indication that it was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>not his intention to use the sides of the wharf to lay vessel.' at, but only the end. At all events, it did not amount to the claim of a right, to use the land and flats of the coterminous proprietor to lay vessels upon, without any title by grant or prescription ; and therefore the silence of the coterminous proprietor is no evidence of his tacit acquiescence in such a claim. At most it can amount to no more than evidence of the consent of such coterminous proprietor, that the party may so cover his flats, with his wharf, if it suits his interest or choice to occupy it as wharf rather than as a dock.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-4\">The principle was much relied upon, that where one stands by and sees another laying out money and making large investments upon property, to which he himself has some claim or title, and he does not give notice of it, he cannot afterwards, in equity and good conscience, set up such claim or title. This we think is a very just and well settled principle, when well understood and properly applied. But it does not apply to this case, because the acts of Mr. Gray did not tacitly or expressly amount to any claim upon the property or rights of the coterminous proprietors, whose estate the defendant now holds ; but were either such as'he had a right to do, within the exercise of his own rights, upon his own flats, or were done upon the public domain, against which those proprietors could make no legal resistance. Besides, the principle insisted on requires some qualification, and can be only held to apply against one who claims under some trust, lien or other right not equally open and apparent to the parties, and in favor of one who would be deceived or misled by such want of notice. But where the act of one is an encioachment on the soil or rights of another, an acknowledged tort, equally well known, or equally open to the notice of both parties, it gives no right, until it has continued for such a length of time without interruption, as to found the presumption of a grant, or give effect to the limitation of the right of action for the disturbance, as determined by common law or by statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-5\">In this suit, it must be remembered, that the plaintiff seeks to enjoin and inhibit the defendant from building out and extending his own wharf, within the limits of his own original mes, and upon an extension of those lines to low-water mark, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>a claim which in the opinion of the Court cannot be maintained. But this opinion is not intended to affect in any respect, the rights of the parties to a small triangular piece, covered by the wharf of the plaintiff at the northwest corner thereof. That portion of the wharf, as appears by the plans used at the hearing, lies west of the line of the plaintiff\u2019s flats, as extended from the shore to low-water mark, and lies upon that part of the land below low-water mark which lies in front of the defendant\u2019s land. It is land originally below low-water mark, a part of the public domain, and owned by neither of these parties. No claim is made for it, in this suit, by the defendant, and the only point open, and the only one to which this opinion applies, is, that the plaintiff has established no right, for the purposes of dockage, to that portion of the flats lying west of the original line of his own flats, and over the land and flats which would be covered by the defendant\u2019s wharf, if extended in like manner.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-7\"><em>Plaintiff\u2019s bill </em>dismissed, <em>with costs.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
