The demandant owned a house and land fronting westerly on Charles street, in Boston, and running back easterly towards George street, and the tenant owned a house and land fronting easterly on George street and running back westerly towards Charles street.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b70-8\">Prior to January 23, 1807, the parcels belonging to both parties, together with other adjoining land, were owned by Charles Bulfinch.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b70-9\">On January 23, 1807, Bulfinch conveyed to Silas Whitney, junior, a parcel of land bounded westerly on the great street, (Charles street,) 60 feet, southerly on land of Whitney 85 feet, more or less, easterly on Bulfinch\u2019s own land 60 feet, and northerly on Bulfinch\u2019s own land 85 feet, more or less.

These lots were subsequently divided and one of them came, through several mesne conveyances, to the tenant, hv a deed dated May 24, 1832.</summary>\n<otherdate data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"b71-12\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>\n<em>March 14th.</em>\n</otherdate>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"b71-13\">\n<em>March 19th.</em>\n</decisiondate>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b71-3\">The deed to Joy and others referred to a plan which Bulfinch, subsequently to his deed to Whitney, had prepared and signed and placed on record in the registry of deeds, on which the lots above mentioned were laid down, giving to the lot previously sold to Whitney about 88 feet in depth and including the demanded premises, and designating the lots on George street, then owned by Bulfinch himself, as 80 feet deep.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b71-4\">On measuring back from Charles street towards George street 85 feet, for the demandant\u2019s lot, and back from George street towards Charles street 80 feet for the tenant\u2019s lot, there is a strip between them, which is the land in controversy.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b71-5\">The question of title depended entirely upon the construction of the deeds as applied to the lots of the parties and the adjoining land, without any aid from evidence of possession or occupancy.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b71-6\"><em>Bartlett </em>and <em>F.

R. 469 ; <em>Dibble </em>v. Rogers, 13 Wendell, 537 ; and that as the deed to Joy was precise and accurate in its measurements, and as it referred to a plan which also was accurate, Joy could take what the deed and plan gave him and no more ; <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Rainsford, 17 </em>Mass. R. 211.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b71-7\"><em>H. H. Fuller </em>and <em>Washburn,</em></attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AKm\">for the tenant, said that the grant to Whitney being taken from a larger lot of the grantor, without reference to any monuments, the lines \u201c 85 feet <em>more or less </em>\u201d must be taken to be precisely 85 feet, and thus the easterly line of Whitney\u2019s lot was clearly ascertained ; <em>Tyler </em>v. <em>Hammond, </em>11 Pick. 193 ; <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Rainsford, </em>17 Mass. R. 207 ; and that as the land granted to Joy, is described as running back from George street 80 feet and bounded on Whitney\u2019s land, the monument, that is, the boundary line of Whitney\u2019s land, controls the measurement, and gives to Joy \u201e more than 80 feet in depth.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b71-8\">Shaw C. J.</author>\n<p id=\"Atm\">delivered the opinion of the Court. In con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>struiug the deed from Bulfinch to Whitney, bounding the estate on Charles street, and running back 85 feet more or less, these words \u201c more or less,\u201d may be considered as having some meaning, so as not to fix the distance absolutely, though these words are often introduced without having practically any effect. The words of description, \u201c 85 feet more or less,\u201d if there were nothing in other parts of the deed, or the subject to which it applies, to control or explain them, especially where the grant is of a parcel measured out of the grantor\u2019s own larger tract, would be equivalent to 85 feet absolutely. But the words <em>\u201c </em>more or less \u201d may be considered equivalent to a suggestion, that either there is some monument, abuttal or line there, or as an intimation that one is intended to be placed there, to stand as the line intended, in place of the absolute admeasurement. The fact that Bulfinch the grantor, soon after the execution of this deed, made a plan of this and the adjoining lots, and placed it on record for the information of all concerned, making these two lines described as 85 feet more or less, about 88 or 89 feet, is equivalent to the fixing of such line or monument, so far as his own rights and those claiming under him were concerned. It may be presumed to have been done by agreement and in pursuance of the contract of sale ; but without such presumption, it would be conclusive of the intent of the grantor, in regard to the indefinite words used in his deed, and good against him and those claiming under him. This act being done by Bulfinch, before he conveyed any of the other lots, is sufficient to answer the rule of fixing a monument or abuttal soon after the conveyance.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-9\">But there is another view of the case which seems quite decisive. The subsequent deed of Bulfinch to the ancestor of the defendant, and that\u2019 under which alone he can claim, described the lot as bounded on George street, and running back 80 feet, and there bounded on the land of Whitney and Blaney. The same deed referred to the plan then on record, and therefore the bound on the land of Whitney and Blaney, most naturally and obviously means, the land of Whitney and Blaney as designated and marked upon that plan, especially as such construction gave to the grantees the whole depth of 80 feet as mentioned tn the deed.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>The Court are of opinion, that the demandant has established the better title to the narrow strip of land in question, and is entitled to recover it in this action.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
