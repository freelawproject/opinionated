Chief Justice Neil</author>\n<p id=\"AsV\">delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-6\">This is an appeal from the Chancellor\u2019s opinion, and final decree, dismissing the complainant\u2019s suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-7\">Mrs. Mary Louise Sandlin filed her original bill, on her own behalf and minor children, against J. D. Gentry, d/b/a Gentry Trucking Company and Globe Indemnity Company under the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Law, T.C.A. sec. 50-901 et seq., seeking an award for the death of her husband, and for medical and funeral expenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-8\">The deceased, Livie Lonzo Sandlin, was an employee of J. D. Gentry at the time of his death, which occurred at the place of his employment, as the result of a personal encounter with one Lonnie Brake, who was a part tim\u00e9 employee of the .defendant. The said Brake was night-watchman for Gentry and- other neighboring places of business. The encounter between the deceased and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>Br\u00e1ke-occurred on the night of June 28, 1955, and death resulted from a gunshot wound inflicted by the said Brake. - \u25a0 <em>\u2022 t.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b520-3\">. There is no dispute as to the fact that both men w\u00e9re employed by Gentry and that the fatal encounter'took place upon the premises of the defendant employer^</p>\n<p id=\"b520-4\">' \u25a0 The , Chancellor reviewed the evidence and, in a written \u25a0finding of fact, found that the deceased was the aggresr-sor. The suit was accordingly dismissed. In his memorandum overruling complainant\u2019s motion for a new trial he said: .</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Auxi\">\u201cAfter again considering the record, no other conclusion can be reached by the Court but that the difficulty between Sandlin and Brake was a personal encounter, and it did not arise out of employment by the defendant, Gentry. In other words, the Court is of the \"opinion that:it was not an accident arising out'of employment, \u00e1s it was .not apparent to a rational mind, upon consideration of all of the circumstances that there was \u2019a causal connection between the conditions ,vunder which Sandlin\u2019s work was required to be done and the resulting injury, or death. \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b520-6\">We think there is material .evidence'to show that the .deceased was the aggressor from the beginning of the difficulty with Brake.. While the issue may be debatable, ..the evidence clearly preponderates in support of the 'Chancellor\u2019s conclnsion as to which of the men was the aggressor.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-7\">\u25a0 vThe fatal difficulty had its beginning as the: result of a v\u00e9ry trivial matter. The. deceased had been called to 'the garage of Gentry Trucking Company to straighten <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>o lit a mistake whereby some steel, belonging ta Kerrigan Iron Works, had been loaded npon one of Gentry\u2019s trucks. The steel was bound together by steel, .bands which had to be broken apart in order to transfer them. Three employees of Kerrigan and the deceased were engaged in this operation. While thus engaged some one of them asked for a crowbar to disengage the steel. Whereupon the deceased Sandlin went into the garage to find one. In the meantime a steel hook was found by one of the men on the .truck and suggested that the crowbar was not needed. When this became apparent to Brake, who was standing nearby but taking no part in the matter, he called to Sandlin to \u201cforget about it\u201d. When Sandlin came out of the building he said to Brake, in substance that he (Brake) \u201ccouldn\u2019t tell him what to do.\u201d At this time there was no physical encounter between the men, but some argument was had.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-4\">The steel was loaded on another truck which was driven by Sandlin to Kerrigan\u2019s place of business and unloaded, and then Sandlin returned to his; or Gentry\u2019s place, arriving about 10 P.M. About this time the two men again met .in front of Gentry\u2019s. Brake was armed with a pistol and blackjack. The employer, J. D. Gentry, came upon them shortly after this, and had a pistol on the seat of his car. When the parties thus met for the second time Sandlin called Brake a vile name and told him he had better not hit him with that blackjack. Sand-lin got out of his truck and there was a physical encounter between them. According to the testimony of J. D. Gentry, and also Brake, the deceased called Brake this vile name and \u201che hit him in the nose and knocked him down.\u201d (Tr. p. 66.) On cross-examination by complainant\u2019s counsel, Mr. Gentry gave the following testimony:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>\u201cQ. Did yon hear Mr. Sandlin make that remark that night ont there? A. No sir, I did not.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-6\">\u201cQ. But yon did see Mr. Sandlin strike him in the face? A. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-7\">\u201cQ. And knock him back some 10 feet? A. I sure did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-8\">\u201cQ. And when Mr. Brake got up off the ground, there was blood running down his face and all over his shirt, and he shot Mr. Sandlin? A. That is correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-9\">* * * * # *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-10\">\u201cQ. You say at the time Mr. Brake got struck, he had his pistol in one hand and his blackjack in the other A. That is right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-11\">\u201cQ. And he was knocked 8 or 10 feet backwards by Mr. Sandlin? A. That is right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-12\">\u201cQ. To the ground? A. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-13\">\u201cQ. Was his face bleeding when he got up and was his shirt front bloody? A. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-14\">\u201cQ. Did he drop his blackjack and pistol when he was knocked to the ground? A. No, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-15\">\u201cQ. He held on to them? A. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-16\">\u201cQ. And he got up and shot Mr. Sandlin? A. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-17\">\u201cQ. That is your testimony that you want this Court .to believe? A. Yes, sir.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b522-18\">According to Brake, who was a defendant\u2019s witness, the deceased, following his return to the Gentry garage and upon seeing him, said: \u201cNow, I am going to settle this with you, you God damned son-of-a-bitch. \u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>\u201c * * * .Q. Had you said anything to Mr. Sandlin at that time? A. No, I had not had anything to say.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-5\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-6\">\u201cA. * * * When I turned to my right here, I got hit.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ACe\">\u201cQ. Who hit yon? A. Sandlin.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-8\">\u201cQ. Did he knock you down? A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-9\">\u201cQ. What did he do to you, A. Well, he got down there on top of me, and when I tried to get up,' I got kicked in the back and face, and I finally did get up.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-10\">\u201cQ. Up to that time, you say when Mr. Sandlin hit you, had you threatened to kill Mr. Sandlin? A. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-11\">\u201cQ. Had you cursed him in any way? A. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-12\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-13\">\u201cQ. When you finally got up, how far was Mr. Sand-lin from you? A. Well, I would say about two good steps, or about 6 or 7 feet.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-14\">\u201cQ. Was he hacking away from you or coming at you? A. He said, \u2018Get your damn gun, it ain\u2019t no bigger than mine.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-15\">\u201cQ. Did you know whether or not he was armed? A. I didn\u2019t know.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-16\">\u201cQ. Did he start toward you then? A. He took a step like he was going to lunge.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-17\">\u201cQ. What did you do? A. Shot him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-18\">\u201cQ. Where did you shoot him? A. Well, all I know is what I heard. They said he was shot in the head. \u2019 \u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b524-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>It was -apon the foregoing testimony, and finding of fact that the Chancellor dismissed the complainant\u2019s snit.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-3\">The appellant has filed 15 assignments of error, several relating to alleged errors in the' Chancellor\u2019s conclusions from the proven facts. It is insisted that he overlooked and failed to consider certain facts favorable to the complainant. We cannot undertake to consider these facts and weigh them against the finding of facts by the Chancellor. We could not do so without trying the case <em>de novo, </em>which is contrary to all precedents in workmen\u2019s compensation cases.</p>\n<p id=\"AhS\">The third assignment is, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aeh\">\"The Court committed error in its conclusion that Sandlin\u2019s death did not arise out of and in the course of his employment, because, according to the Court\u2019s finding of fact, Sandlin initiated the attack upon Brake and was the aggressor throughout. The question of which employee was the aggressor is immaterial to the issue as to whether the injury occurred in the course of and arose out of the employment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b524-6\">In commenting on another assignment, which is argumentative, it is urged upon us:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AsZ\">\u201cSince the Court did not find that Sandlin\u2019s conduct constituted willful misconduct within the meaning of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Law, the finding of fact that Sandlin initiated the attack on Brake does not bar petitioner\u2019s recovery in this case.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b524-8\">The foregoing statement is a conclusion of the complainant\u2019s counsel. It is not warranted by the facts. We think it is reasonable to conclude from all the evidence that the encounter was personal as between the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>panties, and: that the deceased was guilty of \u201cwilful misconduct\u201d in that his attach upon Brake was without any excuse.</p>\n<p id=\"A4qp\">While it is the duty of the Court to liberally construe the compensation statute we cannot overlook the finding of facts by the Chancellor, and reach a contrary conclusion under the guise of liberality of construction.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-4\">Other.assignments of error are (1) \u201cThe Court committed error in ruling that petitioner did not carry the burden of pro.cf\u201d; (2) \u201cThe evidence preponderates the Court\u2019s conclusion of law that Sandlin was not injured in the course of his employment\u201d; and (3) the court erred in ruling as immaterial as to the state of mind of the deceased immediately before his remonstration with Brake.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-5\">The foregoing assignments are argumentative of the determinative, issue, that is, was this homicide an accident arising.out of \u00e1nd in the course of Sandlin\u2019s employment?</p>\n<p id=\"b525-6\">In support of the assignments counsel relies upon <em>Whaley v. Patent Button Co., </em>184 Tenn. 700, 202 S.W.2d 649; <em>United States Fidelity &amp; Guaranty Co. v. Barnes, </em>182 Tenn. 400, 187 S.W.2d 610; <em>Jim Reed Chevrolet Co. v. Watson, </em>194 Tenn. 617, 254 S.W.2d 733; and other cases from foreign jurisdictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-7\"> While it is held in <em>Tapp v. Tapp, </em>192 Tenn. 1, 236 S.W.2d 977, that the Court must construe the language of the statute, such as \u201cout of\u201d, liberally we can do so only when it is \u201crationally possible\u201d in order to sustain a reasonable causal relation as between the injured employee and his employer. Under the undisputed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>facts of this case we think this homicide did'not \u201c arise out of and in the coarse of\u201d the deceased\u2019s employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-5\">The rule is well stated by the Chancellor:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-6\">\u201cBefore there can be a recovery under the Act, it is necessary that the injury or death arise out of and during the course of employment of the employee. Arising out of and in the course of employment are not synonymous. An employee may suffer an injury during the course of his employment but at the same time it does not necessarily follow that the injury arose out of and in the course of his employment. An accident arises \u2018out of employment.\u2019 where there is apparent to the rational mind upon consideration of all the circumstances a <em>casual </em>connection between the conditions under which the work is required to be done and the resultant injury. <em>Chamber of Commerce v. Turner, </em>158 Tenn. 323, 13 S.W.2d 318; <em>Toombs v. Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., </em>173 Tenn. 38, 114 S.W.2d 785; <em>Whaley v. Patton Button Co., </em>184 Tenn. 700, 202 S.W.2d 649.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b526-7\">The assignments of error are overruled, and the Chancellor\u2019s decree is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
