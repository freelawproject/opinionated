See <em>Butcher v. Mosby, </em>197 Tenn. 107, 270 S.W. 2d 377. Mrs. Elrod has accordingly filed a petition to rehear, wherein it is stated that Mr. Elrod\u2019s reply brief falsely attributed to the Chancellor the following statements, to wit:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b63-9\">(1) \u201cThe evidence and record in this cause made out a case of cruel and inhuman treatment entitling the complainant to an absolute divorce, but for the two year residence Statute.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b63-10\">(2) \u201cIn his oral opinion, the Chancellor announced but for the two year residence. Statute, the facts warranted a divorce on the ground of cruel and inhuman treatment. \u2019 \u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b63-11\">The concern expressed by the petition to rehear is that these statements in Mr. Elrod\u2019s reply \u201ccould very well have been the determination upon which petition for <em>certiorari </em>was denied\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-12\">In disposing of the petition for <em>certiorari, </em>this Court proceeded on the assumption that the Chancellor had made no formal finding either way as to whether the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>proof of events which, occurred in New York, together with those which occurred in Tennessee, justified a divorce, except for the jurisdictional fact. The foregoing statements attributed to Mr. Elrod\u2019s reply brief played no part in the denial of the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-5\">The Court of Appeals did conclude as a fact, taking the New York evidence into consideration, that \u201cthe clear preponderance of the evidence would have warranted\u201d the granting of a divorce to Mr. Elrod, except for the jurisdictional fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-6\">The other ground assigned by the petition as justification for a rehearing is that \u201cthe opinion of the Court of Appeals may be clarified\u201d. The petition, makes no specification as to what its authors think should be clarified. This ground of the petition cannot, therefore, be further considered.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-7\">The petition to rehear will be denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
