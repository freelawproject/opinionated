Code, \u00a7 459). Both contend no substantial evidence supports the judgment. Leffingwell also asserts the court improperly (1) excluded as hearsay his postarrest statement to the arresting officer and (2) refused his proposed jury instruction. Frye additionally asserts prosecutorial misconduct during his own cross-examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-10\">About 1:15 a.m., Nancy R. saw two men standing beside her neighbor Doray\u2019s home. Twenty minutes later, Nancy R. saw a shadow move across Doray\u2019s bedroom window. Nancy R., suspicious because Doray\u2019s home had been unoccupied for over 11 months, called police.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-11\">Police arrived within five minutes. Officer Henderson saw Frye beside the house. Seeing Henderson, Frye ran to the rear, meeting Officer Winter stationed in the backyard. Frye turned back toward Henderson who ordered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"946\">*946</page-number>Frye to \u201cfreeze.\u201d Frye complied. Searching Frye, Henderson found a flashlight and large hunting knife. Immediately after Henderson yelled \u201cfreeze,\u201d Leffingwell ran out the back door of the house. Winter arrested Leffingwell, finding a flashlight and a small buck knife on his possession. Police did not find any stolen property or burglar tools.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-4\">Doray\u2019s home was ransacked. John Craig, Doray\u2019s son, had inspected the house three days earlier and found everything in order at that time. Now, however, each room had been disturbed. Several pieces of furniture were missing; dishes were neatly stacked in boxes near the door; kitchen chairs were neatly stacked on each other, ready to be carried away.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-5\">Frye and Leffingwell admit their presence at Doray\u2019s Lemon Grove home. However, Frye testified<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> he and Leffingwell were not there to steal but to sleep. Munz, a friend of Frye, testified he told Frye about a place to sleep, an unoccupied house in Lemon Grove. Munz himself had previously slept there. Munz said he told Frye the house could be identified because it was behind the Horseshoe Tavern and there was a brown, rusty old car in front. Frye testified a brown old car was parked in front of Doray\u2019s house that night. Frye explained he and Leffingwell approached Doray\u2019s house by mistake, thinking it was the house Munz had described. The house Munz described, however, is across the street from Doray\u2019s house.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-6\">In rebuttal, Nancy R. testified only a blue car was parked in front of Doray\u2019s house that night. She further stated an old brown car was parked across the street. Officer Winter testified no brown car was parked at Do-ray\u2019s house that night.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-7\">The court sentenced Leffingwell to prison for the two-year midterm plus one year for a prior prison term (Pen. Code, \u00a7 667.5, subd. (b)). The court sentenced Frye to prison for the two-year midterm, suspended execution of sentence, placing him on three years probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-8\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b706-9\">Leffingwell contends no substantial evidence supports a finding he entered Doray\u2019s home with the intent to steal.  Frye, asserting the jury convicted him as an aider and abettor, contends no substantial evidence shows he knowingly and intentionally aided Leffingwell.  Deciding these issues, we review the entire record in the light most favorable to the judgment to determine whether a reasonable jury could find guilt beyond a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"947\">*947</page-number>reasonable doubt. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Johnson </em>(1980) 26 Cal.3d 557, 578 [162 Cal.Rptr. 431, 606 P.2d 738, 16 A.L.R.4th 1255].)</p>\n<p id=\"b707-5\">Although the People must show Leffingwell entered Doray\u2019s home with the intent to steal, such intent may be inferred from all the facts and circumstances. <em>(See People </em>v. <em>Sullivan </em>(1969) 271 Cal.App.2d 531, 543 [77 Cal.Rptr. 25] [circumstantial evidence of intent where no theft committed].)  Here, substantial evidence supports Leffingwell\u2019s conviction. Leffingwell made an unauthorized entry into a vacant home at 1 a.m. After a police officer yelled \u201cfreeze,\u201d Leffingwell ran out the back door. The late hour and sudden flight upon discovery support the inference Leffingwell entered with the intent to steal. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Lamica </em>(1969) 274 Cal.App.2d 640, 644 [79 Cal.Rptr. 491].) Moreover, Leffingwell had a knife and flashlight at the time of arrest. A knife, although not a sophisticated burglary tool, has purposes consistent with entering a vacant home to steal. Leffingwell\u2019s possessing a flashlight is inconsistent with the story he was looking for a place to sleep at an occupied home. Henderson testified the exterior of Doray\u2019s house was well-lighted.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-6\">Nevertheless, Leffingwell asserts the jury could not reasonably find an intent to steal because he did not possess burglar tools or stolen property. Moreover, Leffingwell contends he could not have been the person who ransacked Doray\u2019s home, stacked chairs, and boxed dishes because he was inside only 20 minutes. However, any degree of improbability of Leffingwell\u2019s ransacking and gathering property in 25 minutes is not determinative of his intent when he entered. Leffingwell\u2019s flight after Henderson yelled \u201cfreeze\u201d shows Leffingwell was unexpectedly interrupted. Under these circumstances, his failure to take property with him before flight is not inconsistent with the verdict. The jury could disbelieve Leffingwell\u2019s story that he entered the unoccupied home to sleep. Munz testified he told Frye and Leffingwell they could sleep at the house with the old brown rusty car parked in front. Munz, who described Doray\u2019s home as one frequented by transients, was impeached by the contradictory statements of Nancy R. who had been watching Doray\u2019s home for some time. Nancy R. and Winter testified no old brown car was parked in front of Doray\u2019s home. The brown car was parked across the street. The jury disbelieved Leffingwell\u2019s story, and substantial evidence supports the judgment because a reasonable trier of fact could find Leffingwell guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Johnson, supra, 26 </em>Cal.3d 557, 579.)</p>\n<p id=\"b707-7\">There is no evidence Frye entered Doray\u2019s home. Therefore, the court instructed the jury about aider and abettor liability. Asserting he mistook Doray\u2019s home for the sleeping house Munz described and that he did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"948\">*948</page-number>not know of Leffingwell\u2019s entry or purpose, Frye contends no substantial evidence supports his conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-4\">To convict Frye as an aider and abettor, the People must show he aided Leffingwell with knowledge of his criminal purpose and with the intent or purpose to commit or assist in committing the underlying burglary. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Beeman </em>(1984) 35 Cal.3d 547, 560 [199 Cal.Rptr. 60, 674 P.2d 1318].)  Substantial evidence supports Frye\u2019s conviction. As discussed above, the jury was entitled to and did disbelieve Frye\u2019s story. Moreover, Frye was outside Doray\u2019s home when Henderson arrived. Seeing Henderson, Frye ran to the backyard where Leffingwell could be warned. Henderson found a flashlight and a knife when he arrested Frye. The jury could reasonably find from these facts that Frye was a lookout while Leffingwell inventoried the vacant home. Further, Frye drove to the house, parking his car in an alley behind a garage. Officer Oakley, familiar with this Lemon Grove area, testified there is no direct access from Frye\u2019s car to Doray\u2019s house. The jury could reasonably infer that contrary to Frye\u2019s testimony, he did not intend to announce his presence at an occupied sleeping house. Instead, Frye tried to conceal his presence at a house he intended to burglarize.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b708-7\">Frye testified in his own behalf. At the end of the People\u2019s cross-examination, and not responding to any question, Frye declared, \u201cI do have a reputation more or less with people that know me, that if they leave something in their car and I\u2019m working on their car and there\u2019s some stuff in their car, they don\u2019t have to worry about it.\u201d The following questioning occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b708-8\">\u201cQ. You have a reputation about property, you mean folks don\u2019t have to worry about that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b708-9\">\u201cA. About taking other people\u2019s belongings.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b708-10\">\u201cQ. And you never had that problem in the past before?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b708-11\">\u201cA. No, never have, not any time in my life.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b708-12\">\u201cQ. And you sure of that, Mr. Frye?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b708-13\">\u201cA. Yes, Ma\u2019am.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b708-14\">\u201cQ. May I have a moment, Your Honor?\u201d Apparently, at this point the District Attorney began looking through some papers. The following questioning continued:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b709-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"949\">*949</page-number>\u201cQ. Does burglary relate to other people\u2019s property, Mr. Frye?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b709-5\">\u201cA. Pardon me?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b709-6\">\u201cQ. Does burglary relate to other people\u2019s property?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b709-7\">\u201cA. Yes, it does.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b709-8\">\u201cQ. Mr. Frye, anything else you would like to tell us before I finish?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b709-9\">\u201cA. No, Ma\u2019am, not really.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b709-10\">Asserting this questioning improperly insinuated he had a prior burglary conviction,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Frye sought a mistrial for prosecutorial misconduct. The court denied the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-11\">Regardless of the propriety of counsel\u2019s questioning,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> any error did not prejudice Frye. The court, hearing and seeing the events, believed the only fair inference was counsel had no information about Frye\u2019s criminal history. The court stated: \u201cIf you are going to speculate about what somebody would\u2014what inference they would draw, it would be that they didn\u2019t have anything. If she did, she certainly would have asked.\u201d Frye did not ask the court to admonish the jury not to draw an inference from counsel\u2019s questioning. Because the court reasonably concluded counsel\u2019s conduct did not impermissibly impeach Frye, there is no reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-12\">HI</p>\n<p id=\"b709-13\">Winter arrested Leffingwell. At the preliminary examination, Winter testified he transported Leffingwell to the Lemon Grove police station. There, Leffingwell told Winter he had \u201cheard about this house\u201d and he had been inside \u201cfor about 15 minutes looking around.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b709-14\">At trial, Winter testified for the People. To prove he did not enter Doray\u2019s house with an intent to steal, Leffingwell asked Winter on cross-examination to repeat the statement Leffingwell told Winter at the police station. The court sustained the People\u2019s hearsay objection. Unsuccessfully arguing the statement was nonhearsay circumstantial evidence of his state of mind, Leffingwell also argued the statement was admissible as a spontaneous declaration. The court ruled the statement was inadmissible hearsay.  Now, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"950\">*950</page-number>on appeal, Leffingwell argues the statement was admissible to rebut a charge of recent fabrication.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b710-4\">Leffingwell offered this statement \u201cto prove his state of mind.\u201d At this time in the trial, the People had not made any charge of recent fabrication. Leffingwell at this point had not testified, ultimately <em>did </em>not, and his personal version of the events was not in evidence, so there was nothing to be regarded as a recent fabrication. Prior consistent statements of a witness, ordinarily inadmissible, may be received to rebut a charge of \u201crecent fabrication.\u201d (Evid. Code, \u00a7 791.) Leffingwell was not a witness. There is no statutory or precedential support for the idea a prior hearsay statement by Leffingwell is admissible to buttress the anticipated testimony of Frye and Munz.  Finally, Leffingwell cannot urge, on appeal, grounds of admissibility which were not presented to the trial court. <em>(Taliaferro </em>v. <em>Crola </em>(1957) 152 Cal.App.2d 448, 450 [313 P.2d 136].)  Therefore, we consider whether the court properly excluded the statement offered to prove state of mind.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-6\">Evidence of a declarant\u2019s statement is not hearsay if it relates facts other than declarant\u2019s state of mind and is offered to circumstantially prove the declarant\u2019s state of mind. (1 Jefferson, Cal. Evidence Benchbook (2d ed. 1982) \u00a7 1.5, p. 67.) However, a statement is hearsay if it directly asserts the declarant\u2019s state of mind and is offered to prove the declarant\u2019s state of mind. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Cruz </em>(1968) 264 Cal.App.2d 350, 356-358 [70 Cal.Rptr. 603]; Evid. Code, \u00a7 1200, subd. (a).) Such a hearsay statement is admissible only if it falls within an exception to the hearsay rule. (Evid. Code, \u00a7 1200, subd. (b).)</p>\n<p id=\"b710-7\">Here, Leffingwell\u2019s statement he entered to \u201clook around\u201d is a direct statement of his intent. Paraphrasing, Leffingwell told police he entered \u201cto look,\u201d not to steal. Because offered for the truth of the matter stated, it is hearsay.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-8\">Leffingwell made the statement at the police station after his arrest. Therefore, the offered statement is one declaring his previously existing state of mind\u2014his state of mind at the time he entered Doray\u2019s home. Where, as here, the declarant\u2019s (Leffingwell\u2019s) past state of mind is in issue, such a statement of past state of mind is not made inadmissible by the hearsay rule if the declarant is unavailable as a witness. (Evid. Code, \u00a7 1251.) However, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"951\">*951</page-number>if the declarant\u2019s statement is made under circumstances indicating a lack of trustworthiness, the statement must be excluded. (Evid. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 1251, 1252.)</p>\n<p id=\"b711-5\">Here, Leffingwell did not present this theory to the trial court, instead arguing the statement was nonhearsay or, if hearsay, a spontaneous declaration. (Evid. Code, \u00a7 1240.) There was no showing Leffingwell\u2019s declaration was made while he was under stress of excitement. The court properly rejected the spontaneous statement argument.  The statement was hearsay, but the court did not determine Leffingwell\u2019s unavailability<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>or </em>whether circumstances showed the statement trustworthy.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>\n                   Even if Leffingwell had properly requested such findings, and assuming the court erroneously excluded the statement, any error would be harmless. The probative value of \u201cI was looking around\u201d to show a lack of intent to steal is slight. The statement is ambiguous, permitting a contrary inference that Leffingwell was \u201clooking around\u201d for something to steal. Leffingwell did not tell Winter he was looking for a place to sleep. Moreover, Leffingwell\u2019s theory explaining his presence inside Doray\u2019s home reached the jury through Munz\u2019 and Frye\u2019s testimony. Therefore, even if the court improperly excluded his statement, any error did not prejudice Leffingwell. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Watson </em>(1956) 46 Cal.2d 818, 836 [299 P.2d 243].)</p>\n<p id=\"b711-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b711-7\">Leffingwell contends the court should not have refused to give the following instruction; \u201cIf you find that the defendant Leffingwell formed the specific intent to steal, take or carry away the personal property of another after he entered the structure, but did not have said specific intent when he entered it, then you cannot find him guilty of burglary.\u201d The court refused to give this instruction, stating \u201cI am refusing this instruction as being covered by the other instructions. \u201d Citing <em>People </em>v. <em>Sears </em>(1970) 2 Cal.3d 180 [84 Cal.Rptr. 711, 465 P.2d 847], Leffingwell contends he has a right to direct the jury\u2019s attention to the underlying issue of intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-8\">Although Leffingwell is entitled to instructions directing the jury\u2019s attention to evidence showing reasonable doubt of his guilt <em>(People </em>v. <em>Sears, supra, </em>2 Cal.3d 180, 190), when the jury is properly instructed, the court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"952\">*952</page-number>need not restate legal principles merely in another manner. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Anderson </em>(1966) 64 Cal.2d 633, 641 [51 Cal.Rptr. 238, 414 P.2d 366].)</p>\n<p id=\"b712-4\">Here, the court properly instructed the jury regarding the required intent to convict Leffingwell of burglary. The court stated: \u201cThe crime of burglary requires at the time of the entry of a building the specific intent to steal</p>\n<p id=\"b712-5\">\u201cEvery person who enters any building with the specific intent to steal . . . is guilty of the crime of burglary.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-6\">\u201cIn order to prove the commission of the crime of burglary, each of the following elements must be proved:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b712-7\">\u201c1. That a person entered a building;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b712-8\">\u201c2. That at the time of the entry such person had the specific intent to steal. ...\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b712-9\">These instructions lucidly and repetitively cover the issue. The court properly refused Leffingwell\u2019s proposed instruction on an issue covered by other instructions. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Slocum </em>(1975) 52 Cal.App.3d 867, 893 [125 Cal.Rptr. 442].) Leffingwell\u2019s repetitive instruction need not have been given.
