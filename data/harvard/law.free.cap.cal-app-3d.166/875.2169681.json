J.</author>\n<p id=\"AqG\">The chief issue in this case is whether certain concerted activities of school employees involved in a labor dispute with a school <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"881\">*881</page-number>district constitute a corrupt practice or are otherwise unlawful and may therefore be restricted without infringing First Amendment rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-5\">Appellants, California School Employees Association, and local CSEA Chapter 44<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> (hereinafter collectively referred to as CSEA) and various individual officers, members and employees of CSEA, appeal the issuance of a preliminary injunction prohibiting them, and others acting in concert with them, from picketing and leafletting outside the personal business offices of certain governing board members of the Pittsburg Unified School District (hereinafter District). They contend that the injunction violates their constitutional rights under the First Amendment and thus seek reversal of the preliminary injunction, dismissal of the underlying complaint for declaratory relief and damages, and the award of court costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-6\">\n<em>Statement of the Case/Facts</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b659-7\">During 1980, CSEA and the District conducted negotiations concerning the reopening of a collective bargaining agreement. On November 17, 1980, after 12 negotiating sessions, the District and CSEA jointly declared that they were at an impasse. Thereafter, a mediator was appointed by the Public Employment Relations Board (PERB). Mediation sessions were held during February and March 1981. Shortly before these sessions commenced, local officers of CSEA 44 began sending letters to members informing them of the status of their dispute with the District and calling for membership support, attendance at meetings of the board of governors of the District, and, in the event these efforts failed, employee action.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-8\">On March 26, 27 and 30, for approximately one hour each day, four or five CSEA members carrying placards and distributing leaflets stationed themselves on the sidewalk in front of the private business offices of respondent governing board members Nancy Parent, an attorney, and Marlene Cacciola, a tax accountant. Said respondents\u2019 offices, which were adjacent to one another, were located in a commercial center on Railroad Avenue, a major thoroughfare of the City of Pittsburg. Many of the placards carried <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"882\">*882</page-number>by the picketers described their activity as a \u201cPublic Information Picket.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In declarations presented to the trial court, officers of CSEA and members involved in the picketing asserted that picketers did not block ingress or egress from the buildings and that no one was otherwise discouraged from entering respondents\u2019 business premises or from doing business with them.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-4\">On March 30, 1981, the third day of the picketing, the District filed a complaint and supporting declarations with the Contra Costa County Superior Court seeking injunctive relief and damages against appellants. The District sought to enjoin appellants from picketing outside the business offices and residences of the governing board members, as well as one million dollars in punitive damages. Concurrently, the District applied for a temporary restraining order and an order to show cause regarding preliminary injunction. On March 31, 1981, Judge David A. Dolgin issued a Memorandum Decision and Temporary Restraining Order prohibiting appellants from picketing at the \u201cprivate offices, businesses or places of employment\u201d or \u201cprivate residences\u201d of members of the District\u2019s governing board.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> A hearing was held before Judge Dolgin on the request for a preliminary injunction on April 14, 1981. A Memorandum of Decision issued the following day denying the request for injunctive relief and dissolving the temporary restraining order \u201con the sole ground that the school district itself is not a proper party to enforce the personal rights of individual Board members.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b660-5\">On April 15, 1981, after the temporary restraining order was dissolved, the attorney for appellants telephoned various CSEA members to inform them of the order dissolving the restraining order and advised that CSEA <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"883\">*883</page-number>should limit its activity to leafletting. Accepting this advice, no more than seven CSEA members returned to the public sidewalks on April 15, 16 and 17 without placards for the sole purpose of leafletting. The single type of leaflet utilized, which was assertedly handed only to passers-by who indicated interest, identified the occupations represented by CSEA and asked for the public\u2019s help in obtaining what it termed a fair contract. The public was urged to call board members whose names were listed on the leaflet.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-5\">In the words of one of the officers of CSEA, the purpose of the leafletting was \u201c[t]o draw attention from the public to the fact that these are Board members and [that] they can be contacted.\u201d Appellants did not leaflet outside the other members\u2019 offices because one worked outside of Pittsburg, where the people in that area \u201cwould not be the voting electorate for the Pittsburg Unified Board members and they would not be able to support [CSEA] views on the contract\u201d; another member was retired; and appellants were not certain where the fifth member was employed.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-6\">On April 17, 1981, the District amended its complaint to include the five governing board members, individually and in their official positions, and sought another temporary restraining order. On the same day, appellants filed a declaration of prejudice against Judge Dolgin pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 170.6, whereupon Judge Dolgin declared himself disqualified. The case was transferred to Judge Richard Arnason, who refused to issue a temporary restraining order and set the preliminary injunction request for hearing on an order to show cause. Respondents sought a petition for extraordinary relief from this court on April 22, 1981, which was denied as premature.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-7\">Consistent with an interim agreement signed by the parties on April 23, CSEA ceased its leafletting activity to facilitate a negotiating session that took place on April 28. That negotiating session resulted in the agreement by CSEA that further concerted activity would cease until negotiations were concluded. In return, the District agreed not to seek a hearing on the preliminary injunction during this period. At a final negotiating session on May 11 the parties jointly concluded that the factfinding procedures of Government Code section 3548.1 should be invoked. CSEA agreed to refrain from concerted activity for a reasonable time in order to allow the parties to prepare for the hearing on the preliminary injunction but did not agree to refrain from that activity for the duration of the factfinding process.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-8\">On May 18, 1981, after an earlier consolidated hearing on both respondents\u2019 request for preliminary injunction and appellants\u2019 demurrer to the amended complaint, Judge Robert J. Cooney issued a memorandum decision <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"884\">*884</page-number>overruling the demurrer, providing appellants 20 days within which to answer, and granting the preliminary injunction substantially as prayed for.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> An order consistent with this decision was issued on June 11, 1981.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Thereafter appellants filed a timely answer to the complaint and a motion to reconsider, which was denied. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-4\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b662-5\">Before reaching the merits, we first confront the thorny question of the trial court\u2019s jurisdiction,  Appellants, amicus California Teachers Association (CTA) and PERB contend that the trial court lacked jurisdiction to enjoin appellants\u2019 activity as PERB had initial exclusive jurisdiction to determine whether the leafletting was an unfair practice under the Educational Employment Relations Act (EERA) (Gov. Code, \u00a7 3540 et seq.)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and, if so, to fashion the appropriate remedy.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-6\">In <em>El Rancho Unified School Dist. </em>v. <em>National Education Assn. </em>(1983) 33 Cal.3d 946 [192 Cal.Rptr. 123, 663 P.2d 893], the Supreme Court reemphasized the conclusion reached in <em>San Diego Teachers Assn. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1979) 24 Cal.3d 1 [154 Cal.Rptr. 893, 593 P.2d 838], \u201cthat the principles defining the preemptive reach of the NLRA [National Labor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"885\">*885</page-number>Relations Act] are generally applicable in determining the scope of PERB\u2019s preemptive jurisdiction under EERA. (24 Cal.3d at p. 12; accord <em>Public Employment Relations Bd. </em>v. <em>Modesto City Schools Dist. </em>(1982) 136 Cal.App.3d 881, 890-891 . . . .)\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 953, fn. omitted.) Embracing the NLRA model, <em>El Rancho- </em>concluded that PERB has exclusive jurisdiction over activities \u201carguably protected or prohibited\u201d by the EERA.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-5\">Under the federal model, state courts have been allowed to enforce certain laws of general applicability even though aspects of the challenged conduct were arguably protected or prohibited by the NLRA. \u201cThus, for example, the Court has upheld state-court jurisdiction over conduct that touches \u2018interests so deeply rooted in local feeling and responsibility that, in the absence of compelling congressional direction, we could not infer that Congress had deprived the States of the power to act.\u2019 [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>Carpenters </em>(1978) 436 U.S. 180, 195 [56 L.Ed.2d 209, 224, 98 S.Ct. 1745].) This \u201clocal concern exception\u201d rests in part upon principles of federalism but also upon a recognition that, in certain areas, decisions of local courts do not present substantial danger of interference with administrative adjudication. <em>(Kaplan\u2019s Fruit &amp; Produce Co. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1979) 26 Cal.3d 60, 75 [160 Cal.Rptr. 745, 603 P.2d 1341].)</p>\n<p id=\"b663-6\">Two factors are considered relevant to application of the local concern exception to the arguably prohibited branch of the preemption doctrine. First, does there exist a \u201csignificant state interest in protecting the citizen from the challenged conduct.\u201d Second, despite the occurrence of the challenged conduct in the course of a labor dispute and the possibility of filing an unfair labor charge, does the exercise of state jurisdiction over the tort claim entail little risk of interference with the regulatory jurisdiction of the administrative agency. <em>(Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>Carpenters, supra, </em>436 U.S. at p. 196 [56 L.Ed.2d at p. 224].) The Supreme Court in <em>Sears </em>summed up the \u201ccritical inquiry\u201d as \u201cwhether the controversy presented to the state court is identical to ... or different from . . . that which could have been . . . presented to the Labor Board.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 197 [56 L.Ed.2d at p. 225]; <em>El Rancho Unified School Dist., supra, </em>33 Cal.3d at p. 956.) \u201cFor it is only in the former situation that a . . . court\u2019s exercise of jurisdiction necessarily involves a risk of interference with the unfair labor practice jurisdiction of the Board which the arguably prohibited branch . . . was designed to avoid.\u201d <em>(Sears, supra, </em>at p. 197, fn. omitted [56 L.Ed.2d at pp. 225-226],)<footnotemark>7</footnotemark>__</p>\n<p id=\"b664-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"886\">*886</page-number>Again following the federal model, the <em>El Rancho </em>court recognized that somewhat different considerations apply when the question is whether the arguably protected character of the conduct in question provides a sufficient justification for preemption. The court acknowledged that the arguably protected branch of preemption doctrine would not apply where the employer could not invoke PERB jurisdiction. <em>(Ibid.) </em>\u201c[T]he arguably protected branch of the preemption doctrine \u2018unquestionably requires that when the same controversy may be presented to the . . . court or the [Board], it must be presented to the Board. But [this rule] does not extend to cases in which an employer has no acceptable method of invoking, or inducing the Union to invoke, the jurisdiction of the Board,\u2019 unless there is \u2018a significant risk of misinterpretation of [the governing labor law] and the consequent prohibition of protected conduct.\u2019 <em>(Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>Carpenters, supra, </em>436 U.S. at pp. 202-203, see discussion at pp. 199-202 . . . .)\u201d (33 Cal.3d at p. 959.)<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b664-4\">In this case, amicus CTA posits that the activity of CSEA at issue arguably violates subdivisions (c) and (d) of Government Code section 3543.6, as a failure to negotiate in good faith and a refusal to participate in impasse procedures. CTA additionally contends that the union\u2019s activity constitutes \u201corganizational participation\u2019\u2019 arguably protected under section 3543.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-5\">We are not persuaded that the subject activity arguably constitutes unfair practices or other violations of EERA. Nor do we view the activity as \u201carguably protected\u201d by the Act as that term has been interpreted in <em>El Rancho. </em>However, we need not decide these questions, as we believe that even if CSEA\u2019s activity is arguably protected or prohibited under the EERA, the \u201clocal concern\u201d exception to preemption is clearly applicable. Without question, as will appear, all parties to this action conceive that the central issue presented to the trial court and on this appeal is whether appellants\u2019 conduct represents a corrupt practice within the meaning of Education Code section 35230 or unlawfully places respondent board members in a conflict of interest of the sort proscribed by Government Code section 1090.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> On these grounds respondents maintain that the conduct may be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"887\">*887</page-number>restricted without infringing appellants\u2019 First Amendment rights. The central legal and constitutional questions thus presented certainly are not within PERB jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-5\">Courts of appeal have held that where the conduct of a party is claimed to violate a duty imposed under the Education Code exhaustion of PERB remedies is not required. For example, in <em>California School Employees Assn. </em>v. <em>Travis Unified School Dist. </em>(1984) 156 Cal.App.3d 242 [202 Cal.Rptr. 699], it was recently held that PERB did not have initial exclusive jurisdiction where an employee association challenged the refusal of a school district to reimburse bus drivers for expenses incurred in transporting students to athletic events and on other field trips as required by Education Code section 44032. \u201cBecause section 44032 mandates districts to reimburse employees for expenses incurred in performing services for them,\u201d the court stated, \u201csuch entitlement to reimbursement is not subject to and thus not within PERB\u2019s exclusive initial jurisdiction.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 250.) The obligation is fixed by statute and \u201cexists independently of the collective bargaining agreement.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>Similarly, in <em>California School Employees Assn. </em>v. <em>Azusa Unified School Dist. </em>(1984) 152 Cal.App.3d 580 [199 Cal.Rptr. 635], it was held that the question whether classified employees were entitled to be paid for local holidays pursuant to Education Code section 45203 is within the court\u2019s rather than PERB\u2019s jurisdiction. <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 591-593.)</p>\n<p id=\"b665-6\">The local concern exception to preemption doctrine has been applied in cases involving the NLRA and the state Agricultural Labor Relations Act even where the union activity in question was arguably prohibited, and therefore may arguably be remedied, under the Act. (See, e.g., <em>Youngdahl </em>v. <em>Rainfair, Inc. </em>(1957) 355 U.S. 131 [2 L.Ed.2d 151, 78 S.Ct. 206]; <em>Auto Workers </em>v. <em>Wisconsin Board </em>(1956) 351 U.S. 266, 274 [100 L.Ed. 1162, 1172, 76 S.Ct. 794]; <em>Bertuccio </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1981) 118 Cal.App.3d 363, 370 [173 Cal.Rptr. 411]; see also, <em>Kaplan\u2019s Fruit &amp; Produce Co. </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>26 Cal.3d 60.)  The local concern exception is therefore consistent with the principles articulated in <em>San Diego Teachers Assn., supra, </em>24 Cal.3d 1, and <em>El Rancho, supra, </em>33 Cal.3d 946, that the jurisdiction of the superior court is not <em>necessarily </em>preempted simply because the activity in question may constitute an arguably prohibited activity under EERA and PERB may have jurisdiction to provide a remedy. The chief reason the jurisdiction of the superior court was held to be preempted in <em>San Diego Teachers Assn, </em>and <em>El Rancho </em>was because under the facts of those cases there was no disparity between the public and PERB interest at stake, which uniformly related to minimizing interruptions in educational <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"888\">*888</page-number>services. <em>(San Diego Teachers Assn., supra, </em>24 Cal.3d at p. 11; <em>El Rancho Unified School Dist., supra, </em>33 Cal.3d at p. 957.)</p>\n<p id=\"b666-4\">The same cannot be said with respect to the present case. As earlier indicated, the EERA does not address the issues of corrupt practices or conflicts of interests involving members of the governing board of a school district, which are not proper subjects of collective bargaining, and these issues are neither of jurisdictional interest to PERB nor within its areas of expertise. Such issues are, on the other hand, of obvious interest to the public and involve legal questions squarely within the jurisdiction and expertise of the courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-5\">Finally, the arguably protected branch of preemption doctrine does not apply here as individual members of the governing board of a school district have no means of invoking, or inducing CSEA to invoke, PERB jurisdiction. Government Code section 3541.5, subdivision (a), provides as pertinent that \u201c[a]ny employee, employee organization, or employer shall have the right to file an unfair practice charge, ...\u201d Section 3540.1, subdivision (j) defines the terms \u201cemployee\u201d as \u201cany person employed by any public school employer except persons elected by popular vote, or persons appointed by the Governor of this state, management employees, and confidential employees.\u201d \u201cPublic school employer\u201d or \u201cemployer\u201d is defined in section 3540.1, subdivision (k), as \u201cthe governing board of a school district, a school district, a county board of education, or a county superintendent of schools.\u201d Respondents, who are individual board members seeking to vindicate private rights, do not come within these definitions. The law\u2019s exclusion of respondents from the categories of employees and employers entitled to claim an unfair labor practice demonstrates that the issues they raise in this litigation are not a significant concern of the EERA and reinforces our conclusion that there is no preemption.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-6\">For the foregoing reasons we conclude that PERB did not have initial exclusive jurisdiction in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-7\">Thus we turn to the central question: whether, as respondents claim, appellants\u2019 activity violated state policy in an area subject to state regulation and may therefore be restricted or, as appellants insist, this activity was entirely lawful and protected.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-8\">n</p>\n<p id=\"b666-9\"> Because of its perception that free discussion concerning the issues involved in a labor dispute is often \u201cindispensable to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"889\">*889</page-number>effective and intelligent use of the processes of popular government to shape the destiny of modern industrial society\u201d <em>(Thornhill </em>v. <em>Alabama </em>(1940) 310 U.S. 88, 103 [84 L.Ed. 1093, 1103, 60 S.Ct. 736]), the United States Supreme Court has more than once reiterated that \u201cthe dissemination of information concerning the facts of a labor dispute must be regarded as within that area of free discussion that is guaranteed by the Constitution.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <em>{Id., </em>at p. 102 [84 L.Ed. at p. 1102], accord, <em>Thomas </em>v. <em>Collins </em>(1945) 323 U.S. 516, 532 [89 L.Ed. 430, 441, 65 S.Ct. 315]; <em>Cafeteria Union </em>v. <em>Angelos, supra, </em>320 U.S. 293; <em>Bakery Drivers Local </em>v. <em>Wohl, supra, </em>315 U.S. 769; <em>A.

The right to inform the public on such issues is protected not only as part of free speech, but as part of free assembly. <em>{Thomas </em>v. <em>Collins, supra, </em>323 U.S. at p. 532 [89 L.Ed. at p. 441]; <em>Hague </em>v. C. <em>I. O. </em>(1939) 307 U.S. 496 [83 L.Ed. 1423, 59 S.Ct. 954].) Furthermore, where the activity in question targets government officials, the right of petition is also placed in issue. <em>{Eastern R.

The privilege of a citizen of the United States to use the streets and parks for communication . . . must not, in the guise of regulation, be abridged or denied.\u201d <em>(Hague </em>v. <em>C. I.

Our own Supreme Court has held that informational picketing and demonstration require a <em>compelling </em>government interest to justify any restriction put upon them in such public areas. <em>(In re Berry, supra, </em>68 Cal.2d 137, 154.)</p>\n<p id=\"b669-6\">Picketing may be restrained only when it is conducted in an unlawful manner or for an unlawful purpose.

Thus, for example, restriction is allowed if the picketing is violent <em>(Drivers Union </em>v. <em>Meadowmoor Co. </em>(1941) 312 U.S. 287 [85 L.Ed. 836, 61 S.Ct. 552, 132 A.L.R. 1200]), if it blocks access to the business picketed <em>(Kaplan\u2019s Fruit &amp; Produce Co., Inc. </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>26 Cal.3d 60), or if it interferes \u201cwith the municipality\u2019s interest in protecting the public health, safety, or order in assuring the efficient and orderly use of the streets and parks for their primary purposes.\u201d <em>(In re Hoffman </em>(1967) 67 Cal.2d 845, 849 [64 Cal.Rptr. 97, 434 P.2d 353].) If the manner in which labor picketing is carried on is not violent or otherwise unlawful, the picketing may then only be enjoined if it seeks to achieve an unlawful purpose.

Instead, their claim is that the objective of that activity\u2014which they characterize as economic coercion\u2014was designed to place the targeted board members in a personal financial conflict of interest. This objective is claimed to be unlawful on the ground that it contravenes the state policy of \u201cpreserving the integrity of the local legislative process\u201d manifest in certain state constitutional, statutory and common law prohibitions of \u201clegislative bribery.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b670-5\">In our view this contention cannot be sustained either on the facts of this case or the legal theories upon which respondents\u2019 argument rests. We examine the facts and the law in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-6\">1.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-7\">The primary evidence of the objective of appellants\u2019 activity is the unrebutted declaration of Laura Michaelis, the president of CSEA Chapter 44, that the purpose of the picketing was \u201cto inform [the public] of the issues involved in the negotiations between CSEA and Pittsburg Unified School District in order that the public may in turn express their views to the elected members of the School District\u2019s Governing Board.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The activity that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"893\">*893</page-number>actually took place is entirely consistent with this declared purpose. For one hour each day members of CSEA passed out leaflets on the public sidewalk in front of the business premises of respondents Parent and Cacciola. The union members did not obstruct access to respondents\u2019 offices nor did they urge employees or clients to cease work or patronage of these businesses. The leaflets that were handed to interested passers-by identified CSEA, described the collective bargaining issues in dispute, listed the names and telephone numbers of board members and urged the reader of the leaflet to \u201clet the school board members know you care about people who care about the Children of Pittsburg. Give them a call and tell them to settle negotiations Now.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b671-5\">Respondents\u2019 contention that, notwithstanding the foregoing evidence to the contrary, appellants were really engaged in an economic boycott is predicated on the fact that appellants\u2019 activity took place in front of respondents\u2019 private business premises. Respondents claim that although appellants were not explicitly urging a boycott of these businesses such a message was implicit in the location of their activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-6\">However, the only indications in the record of the effect of appellants\u2019 activity are contained in the declarations of respondents Parent and Cacciola. Parent stated that her employees had \u201creservations\u201d about crossing the picket line and that some clients \u201cmay have reservations about doing business\u201d with her. Cacciola stated that she was \u201cdeeply concerned about the adverse affect <em>[sic] </em>which this picketing may have on [her] business.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b671-7\">Respondents\u2019 statements represent no more than the assertion of fears and apprehensions. There is no evidence that any of their employees or clients were in fact prevented or discouraged from entering respondents\u2019 premises and carrying out their business. As noted earlier, appellants insisted that they never attempted to prevent or discourage anyone from doing business with respondents; these denials are entirely uncontradicted in the record and there is no basis upon which to find them untrue.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"894\">*894</page-number>\u201cIt is a fundamental principle,\u201d as applicable in connection with labor controversies as in any other context, \u201cthat the drastic sanctions of equity may not be invoked without a detailed showing of specific facts justifying such relief.

If the guarantees of the First Amendment are to be taken seriously, rather than merely to receive lip service, free expression cannot validly be inhibited absent a compelling evidentiary showing of the need to do so sufficient to overcome the heavy presumption that such an inhibition is constitutionally invalid. <em>{Organization for a Better Austin </em>v. <em>Keefe, supra, </em>402 U.S. 415, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"895\">*895</page-number>419 [29 L.Ed.2d 1,5]; <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>13 Cal.3d 652, 657.)<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b673-5\">The evidence is also inadequate to support the claims that appellants\u2019 concerted activity can constitutionally be restricted because the location of that activity is unrelated to the labor dispute between appellants and the District and because, in any event, there are other locations at which appellants could communicate just as effectively with interested citizens.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-6\">With respect to the first of these contentions respondents rely almost entirely on an opinion of a New Jersey trial court restraining police officers from picketing city council members places of employment. <em>(Kulish </em>v. <em>Hillside Policemen\u2019s Benevolent Assn. Local No. 70 </em>(1973) 124 N.J.Super. 263 [306 A.2d 85].) The chief basis for the court\u2019s conclusion that the locations of the picketing were unrelated to the labor dispute between the officers and the city council was that \u201calmost all\u201d of the places picketed were \u201coutside of the Township where defendants\u2019 message is not likely to reach voters and taxpayers of the Township.\u201d The court also found that the picketing entailed \u201ca substantial risk of potential harm to totally neutral third persons,\u201d that is, the council members\u2019 employers and their customers. The facts of the New Jersey case are readily distinguishable from those of the instant case. First, appellants conducted their concerted activity at an apparently well-travelled place within the school district in a manner seemingly calculated to communicate with voters and taxpayers of the District. Moreover, as we have explained, there simply is no evidence that this activity had any adverse effect on respondents or on neutral third parties. (Compare <em>Holt </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1950) 100 Cal.App.2d 403, 406 [223 P.2d 881], disapproved in <em>Environmental Planning &amp; Information Council </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1984) 36 Cal.3d 188, 195, fin. 6 [203 Cal.Rptr. 127, 680 P.2d 1086].)</p>\n<p id=\"b673-7\">Respondents\u2019 assertion that appellants could communicate their message just as effectively elsewhere in the City of Pittsburg is also not substantiated in the record, which is entirely silent on this question. The scant evidence indicates only that appellants\u2019 activity took place on a public sidewalk in front of an undescribed commercial \u201ccomplex\u201d and alongside a main thoroughfare of the City of Pittsburg.  It is established that \u201c \u2018public <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"896\">*896</page-number>places\u2019 historically associated with the free exercise of expressive activities, such as streets, sidewalks, and parks, are considered, without more, to be \u2018public forums.\u2019 [Citations.]\u201d <em>(United States </em>v. <em>Grace, supra, </em>461 U.S. 171, 177 [75 L.Ed.2d 736, 743, 103 S.Ct. 1702, 1706-1707].) In such places, the power of the government to restrict expressive conduct is extremely limited. <em>(Ibid.) </em>Moreover, \u201c[i]t is immaterial that another forum, equally effective may have been available .... As stated in <em>Schneider </em>v. <em>State </em>[1939] 308 U.S. 147, 163 . . .: \u2018[0]ne is not to have the exercise of his liberty of expression in appropriate places abridged on the plea that it may be exercised in some other place.\u2019\u201d <em>(In re Hoffman, supra, </em>67 Cal.2d 845, 852, fn. 7.)</p>\n<p id=\"b674-4\">2.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-5\">Putting aside their failure to make the detailed showing of specific facts necessary to justify the restraint imposed by the trial court, respondents have also failed to advance a tenable legal basis for their assertion that appellants\u2019 activity sought to achieve an unlawful purpose. This legal issue must be addressed because it bears upon respondents\u2019 pending claim for damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-6\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-7\">As earlier noted, respondents maintain that the activities in issue constitute a corrupt practice\u2014which they also label \u201clegislative bribery\u201d\u2014 violative of a state policy to preserve \u201cthe integrity of the local legislative process.\u201d Although they find this state policy expressed also in constitutional and Penal Code provisions relating to the bribery of state legislators,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> it is clear that respondents rely most heavily on Education Code section 35230, which as pertinent provides that: \u201cThe offering of any valuable thing to any member of the governing board of any school district, with the intent to influence his action in regard to ... the making of any contract to which the board of which he is a member is a party, or the acceptance by any member of the governing board of any valuable thing, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"897\">*897</page-number>with corrupt intent, is a misdemeanor. \u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Respondents contend in their brief that \u201cimplicit in the setting up of a picket line in front of a business is the promise that, if the demands of the pickets are satisfied, the picketing will cease. That implied promise becomes a \u2018valuable thing\u2019 within the meaning of Education Code section 35230.\u201d To buttress this argument, respondents additionally rely on the common law conflict of interest doctrine codified in Government Code section 1090, which provides that public officials such as respondents \u201cshall not be financially interested in any contract made by them in their official capacity, or by any body or board of which they are members.\u201d (See also Ed. Code, \u00a7 35233.) Respondents state that the objective of the common law rule upon which this statute is based \u201cis to prevent public officers from acting in circumstances in which their public duty <em>might </em>conflict with their private interests.\u201d (Original italics.) Thus, they claim, it applies not only with respect to contracts but \u201cwhenever a public official places himself in a position in which a temptation might arise to subordinate public duties to private interests.\u201d According to respondents, Education Code section 35230 and Government Code section 1090 \u201cseek to ensure that public officers in the discharge of their duties are absolutely free from <em>any influence </em>other than that which flows directly out of their obligations to the public at large.\u201d (Original italics.)</p>\n<p id=\"b675-5\">However, accepting for the moment their formulation of the statutory purpose, respondents fail to recognize that the influence from which they wish to free themselves <em>does </em>flow directly out of their public obligations. Respondents\u2019 imaginative attempt to transform appellants\u2019 activity into \u201cbribery\u201d has no support in the statutes upon which they rely or the case law, would have disastrous consequences for our form of representative government and is fundamentally at war with the First Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-6\">Cases involving public officials that find a corrupt practice or conflict of interest proscribed by statute or by the common law characteristically involve situations in which the official received a direct monetary benefit as a result of a financial relationship with a private enterprise that did business with a public agency of which the official was a member. (See, e.g., <em>Stigall </em>v. <em>City of Taft </em>(1962) 58 Cal.2d 565 [25 Cal.Rptr. 441, 375 P.2d 289] [member of city council an owner of a plumbing company awarded a contract]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Elliott </em>(1953) 115 Cal.App.2d 410 [252 P.2d 661] [attorney-client relationship between board member and bus company]; <em>People </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"898\">*898</page-number>v. <em>Darby </em>(1952) 114 Cal.App.2d 412 [250 P.2d 743] [board member received rents as landlord of company awarded high percentage of gross ice cream sales to the school district].) No case has found a violation of statutes such as are relied upon by respondents as a result of an implied promise to cease activities otherwise protected by the First Amendment on the ground the cessation of such activities would confer an economic benefit on a public official. Indeed, we are unable to find any pertinent case involving the conflict of interest or bribery of a public official in which such a novel contention was ever advanced.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-4\">In the absence of case law directly on point, we think the opinion of the United States Supreme Court in <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Hartlage </em>(1982) 456 U.S. 45 [71 L.Ed.2d 732, 102 S.Ct. 1523], is instructive. The court held in that case that the application of an \u201canti-vote buying\u201d statute utilizing language similar to that of Education Code section 35230 was not valid when applied to a candidate\u2019s promise that if elected he would serve at a salary less than that \u201c\u2018fixed by law.\u2019\u201d <em>(Brown </em>v. <em>Hartlage, supra, </em>456 U.S. 45, 47 [71 L.Ed.2d 732, 737].) Though it acknowledged that the states have a legitimate interest in preserving the integrity of their electoral processes, the court held that a state could not seek to restrict a candidate\u2019s offer of ideas to the voters absent demonstration of a compelling interest. <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 52-54 [71 L.Ed.2d at pp. 740-741].) \u201cThe fact that some voters may find their self interest reflected in a candidate\u2019s commitment does not place that commitment beyond the reach of the First Amendment. We have never insisted that the franchise be exercised without taint of individual benefit; indeed, our tradition of political pluralism is partly predicated on the expectation that voters will pursue their individual good through the political process, and that the summation of these individual pursuits will further the collective welfare. So long as the hoped-for personal benefit is to be achieved through the normal processes of government, and not through some private arrangement, it has always been, and remains, a reputable basis upon which to cast one\u2019s ballot.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 56 [71 L.Ed.2d at pp. 742-743], fn. omitted.) The court refused to characterize the candidate\u2019s promise to take less salary as a bribe. <em>(Id., </em>at p. 57 [71 L.Ed.2d at p. 743].) Crucial to the court\u2019s decision was the fact that his statements were made openly and were subject to criticism from his political opponent and to the scrutiny of voters. Such statements were very different in character from corrupting private agreements and solicitations historically recognized as unprotected by the First Amendment. <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 56-57 [71 L.Ed.2d at pp. 742-743].) The situation presented to us in the instant case, though not apposite in all respects, is nonetheless similar to that in <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Hartlage </em>in a number of particulars. Concerted activities directed at elected officials, like the commitments of candidates for public office, are a traditional means of express<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"899\">*899</page-number>ing views on public issues, are openly subject to public scrutiny, relate to the accountability of public officials, are open to refutation by those who hold opposing views, and are ordinarily protected by the First Amendment. The fact that the self interest of such officials may be affected by the public response to activities openly directed against them does not deprive those activities of constitutional protection.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-5\">We recognize that respondents are only engaged in their public duties part time and rely for their livelihoods on private employment; <em>but they nonetheless remain public officials. </em>Public office is no place for the thin-skinned. Those who function in the public arena \u201cmust be prepared to withstand . . . the protest and controversy which their earlier actions and statements have generated.\u201d <em>(In re Kay </em>(1970) 1 Cal.3d 930, 936, fn. 3 (83 Cal.Rptr. 686, 464 P.2d 142], citing <em>Payroll Guar. Ass\u2019n. </em>v. <em>Board of Education </em>(1945) 27 Cal.2d 197, 202-203 [163 P.2d 433, 161 A.L.R. 1300]; see also <em>Craig </em>v. <em>Harney </em>(1947) 331 U.S. 367, 376 [91 L.Ed. 1546, 1552, 67 S.Ct. 1249], applying this admonition to members of the judicial branch.) If such public protest could be restrained on the grounds alleged by respondents in this case, then significant numbers of public officials could easily insulate themselves from pressures of public office that are not only traditional in our society, but vital to our sometimes boisterous form of representative democracy, which contemplates that an officeholder\u2019s constituents \u201ccan register disapproval of his conduct and seek redress of grievances.\u201d <em>(In re Kay, supra, 1 </em>Cal.3d at p. 939.) The First Amendment would thus become a dead letter with respect to a form of expression to which its application has always been considered particularly essential and therefore entitled to the most stringent protection. Thus, in <em>New York Times Co. </em>v. <em>Sullivan, supra, </em>376 U.S. 254 [11 L.Ed.2d 686], the United States Supreme Court expressed \u201ca profound national commitment to the principle that debate on public issues should be uninhibited, robust, and wide-open, and that <em>[such </em>debate] <em>may well include vehement, caustic, and sometimes unpleasantly sharp attacks on government and public officials.\u201d (Id., </em>at p. 270 [11 L.Ed.2d at p. 701], italics added; see also, <em>Rosenblatt </em>v. <em>Baer </em>(1966) 383 U.S. 75, 85 [15 L.Ed.2d 597, 605, 86 S.Ct. 669]; <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>13 Cal.3d 652, 657-658.) As suggested in <em>Carey </em>v. <em>Brown </em>(1980) 447 U.S. 455 [65 L.Ed.2d 263, 100 S.Ct. 2286], the elected official who has voluntarily chosen to enter the public arena has to a considerable extent \u201c \u2018waived\u2019 his right to privacy with respect to a challenge to his views on significant issues of social and economic policy.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 469 [65 L.Ed.2d at p. 275], fn. omitted.) Criticism of this sort may well have adverse economic consequences for those numerous elected officials who legitimately derive all or a portion of their income from a private enterprise; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"900\">*900</page-number>but this is no basis for necessarily withholding from their critics the benefits of the First Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-4\">Thus, if we felt it necessary to construe Education Code section 35230 in the manner urged by respondents, we would be obliged to declare it unconstitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-5\">For reasons similar to those just set forth, we also conclude that neither Government Code section 1090 prohibiting conflicts of interest<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> nor the common law conflict of interest doctrine sweeps so wide as to render illegal the activity undertaken in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-6\">Relying upon the First Amendment, state and federal courts have refused to find a conflict of interest in situations in which, the \u201cconflict\u201d was considerably more apparent than it is in this case and where the objective sought to be achieved was more plausibly unlawful than the objective sought by appellants here. For example, in <em>Woodland Hills Residents Assn., Inc. </em>v. <em>City Council </em>(1980) 26 Cal.3d 938 [164 Cal.Rptr. 255, 609 P.2d 1029], the California Supreme Court held that city council members were not disqualified from considering and voting on a proposed subdivision by reason of campaign contributions made to council members by the real estate developer, its engineering firm, and its attorneys. The court concluded that political contributions involve an exercise of a fundamental freedom protected by the First Amendment and by article I, section 2, of the California Constitution. \u201cTo disqualify a city council member from acting on a development proposal because the developer had made a campaign contribution to that member would threaten constitutionally protected political speech and associational freedoms.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 946.) Manifestly, the political contributions that were made in <em>Woodland Hills </em>represent a more direct and less visible\u2014and for those reasons more arguably pernicious\u2014attempt to influence the official acts of elected officials than the attempt made by appellants in this case. If, as our Supreme Court held, those political contributions involved the exercise of a constitutionally protected right <em>(ibid.), </em>it is difficult to conclude that appellants\u2019 activity is not also protected. Certainly the public policy that encourages the giving and receiving of campaign contributions is no stronger than that which encourages the free dissemination of information concerning the facts of a public sector labor dispute involving a local school system. (See Gov. Code, \u00a7 3547, subd. (e).)</p>\n<p id=\"b679-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"901\">*901</page-number>The opinion of the United States Supreme Court in <em>Eastern R. Conf. </em>v. <em>Noerr Motors, supra, </em>365 U.S. 127 [5 L.Ed.2d 464], is also pertinent. That case involved an assertedly \u201cvicious, corrupt, and fraudulent\u201d publicity campaign by various railroad interests designed to foster the adoption and retention of laws and law enforcement practices destructive of the trucking business and to create an atmosphere of distaste for truckers among the general public and to impair relations existing between truckers and their customers. <em>(Id., </em>at p. 129 [5 L.Ed.2d at p. 466].) The trial court, finding that the railroads\u2019 publicity campaign was \u201cmalicious and fraudulent,\u201d concluded that it violated the Sherman Act. This judgment, which had been affirmed by the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit (273 F.2d 218), was unanimously reversed by the Supreme Court on the ground that no violation of the Sherman Act can be predicated upon mere attempts to influence the passage or enforcement of laws. (365 U.S. at pp. 135-136 [5 L.Ed.2d at pp. 469-470].) The court reached this result for two reasons. First, it pointed out that, to a very large extent, the concept of representative government \u201cdepends upon the ability of the people to make their wishes known to their representatives. To hold that the government retains the power to act in this representative capacity and yet hold, at the same time, that the people cannot freely inform the government of their wishes would impute to the Sherman Act a purpose to regulate, not business activity, but political activity, a purpose which would have no basis whatever in the legislative history of that Act.\u201d (Id., at p. 137 [5 L.Ed.2d at p. 471], fn. omitted.) The court went on to note that \u201c[s]econdly, and of at least equal significance, such a construction of the Sherman Act would raise important constitutional questions. The right of petition is one of the freedoms protected by the Bill of Rights, and we cannot, of course, lightly impute to Congress an intent to invade these freedoms.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 137-138 [5 L.Ed.2d atp. 471]; accord, <em>Mine Workers </em>v. <em>Pennington, supra, </em>381 U.S. 657, 669-672 [14 L.Ed.2d 626, 635-637]; <em>Franchise Realty, Etc. </em>v. <em>S. F. Loc. Joint Exec. Bd., supra, </em>542 F.2d 1076, cert, den., 430 U.S. 940 [51 L.Ed.2d 787, 97 S.Ct. 1571] .)<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b679-5\"><em>Noerr </em>is relevant here for several reasons. First, the activity challenged in that case was more conceivably inimical to federal policy regarding restraint of trade than appellants\u2019 activity is inconsistent with state policy regarding corrupt practices and conflicts of interest.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Further, we can no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"902\">*902</page-number>more easily impute to our Legislature an intent to infringe First Amendment rights through enactment of the Education and Government Code provisions relied upon by respondents in this case than the Supreme Court could impute such intent to Congress due to its adoption of the Sherman Act. <em>Noerr </em>also demonstrates once again that the protections of the Bill of Rights are not in any way diminished simply because the political activity in question relates to economic issues subject to governmental regulation or because those who undertake such activity have a financial stake in its outcome. (See also, <em>Va. Pharmacy Bd. </em>v. <em>Va. Consumer Council </em>(1976) 425 U.S. 748, 770 [48 L.Ed.2d 346, 363, 96 S.Ct. 1817]; <em>California Transports. Trucking Unlimited, supra, </em>404 U.S. 508, 510-511 [30 L.Ed.2d 642, 646-647, 92 S.Ct. 609] and <em>Matossian s. Fahmie </em>(1980) 101 Cal.App.3d 128, 137 [161 Cal.Rptr. 532] and cases there cited.)</p>\n<p id=\"b680-4\">Despite appellants\u2019 economic interests there can be no serious doubt that their activity focused upon a public issue and was essentially political in nature. As the United States Supreme Court has observed in a case involving a labor dispute between a teachers union and a school board, \u201cdecision-making by a public employer is above all a political process. The officials who represent the public employer are ultimately responsible to the electorate, . . . Through exercise of their political influence as part of the electorate, the employees have the opportunity to affect the decisions of government representatives who sit on the other side of the bargaining table. Whether these representatives accede to a union\u2019s dem\u00e1nds will depend upon a blend of political ingredients, including community sentiment about unionism generally and the involved union in particular, the degree of taxpayer resistance, and the views of voters as to the importance of the service involved and the relation between the demands and the quality of service.\u201d <em>(Abood </em>v. <em>Detroit Board of Education </em>(1977) 431 U.S. 209, 228 [52 L.Ed.2d 261, 280, 97 S.Ct. 1782]; see also <em>id., </em>at p. 257 [52 L.Ed.2d at p. 298] (cone. opn. of Powell, J.)

As Justice Douglas has stated, \u201cIt is common knowledge that the First Amendment was adopted against the widespread use of the common law of seditious libel to punish the dissemination of material that is embarrassing to the powers-that-be.\u201d <em>(New York Times Co. </em>v. <em>United States </em>(1971) 403 U.S. 713, 724 [29 L.Ed.2d 822, 830, 91 S.Ct. 2140] (cone. opn. of Douglas, J.).</p>\n<p id=\"b681-6\">Putting aside for a moment the constitutional considerations, it is also noteworthy that the Legislature has by statute sought to insure \u201cthat the public be informed of the issues that are being negotiated upon [between public school employers and employees] and have full opportunity <em>to express their views on the issues to the public school employer, and to know of the positions of their elected representatives.\u201d </em>(Gov.

Appellants\u2019 activity seems to us far more clearly consistent with the purpose of this statute than it is violative of those upon which respondents rely, which we believe were never intended to apply to traditional forms of speech, assembly, and petition. It may be noted, additionally, that public school employees are among those members of the community most likely to have \u201cinformed and definite opinions\u201d as to issues of public importance regarding the operation of schools and that it is therefore essential that they are able to speak out freely. <em>(Pickering </em>v. <em>Board of Education, supra, </em>391 U.S. 563, 572 [20 L.Ed.2d 811, 819]; <em>Swilley </em>v. <em>Alexander </em>(5th Cir. 1980) 629 F.2d 1018, 1021.)</p>\n<p id=\"b682-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"904\">*904</page-number>Just as judges must be prepared to accept and should not be swayed by public criticism <em>(Craig </em>v. <em>Harney, supra, </em>331 U.S. 367, 376 [91 L.Ed. 1546, 1552]), respondents, as public officials, are \u201c \u2018supposed to be men [and women] of fortitude, able to thrive in a hardy climate. \u2019 \u201d (Tribe, American Constitutional Law (1978) at p. 625, quoting <em>Craig </em>v. <em>Harney, supra.) </em>Members of the governing boards of local school boards, who are not infrequently at the center of public controversy, simply cannot refashion the concept of a conflict of interest to insulate themselves from peaceful and openly exerted efforts to influence their official acts where, as here, those efforts are not definitively proscribed by valid statute and are of a sort traditionally protected by the Bill of Rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-4\">As the record in this case demonstrates none of the grave abuses that provide occasion for permissible restriction of the liberties asserted by appellants under the First Amendment, and because appellants\u2019 activity did not seek to achieve an unlawful objective,<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> the judgment is reversed.

Market Co. </em>v. <em>Lyons </em>(1940) 16 Cal.2d 389 [106 P.2d 414], the union picketed nonunion employers for the legitimate purpose of securing a closed shop in those businesses. The courts refused to enjoin the activity even though the union did not represent employees of the businesses picketed. The term \u201clabor dispute\u201d was not used as the criterion for the decision of whether to enjoin the picketing where the employers were not involved in a dispute with their employees at the time of the pickets. Rather, the determinative issue was whether the union was demanding something which was <em>reasonably related to employment </em>and to the purposes of collective bargaining, and whether the attainment of their object would benefit them directly or would enhance their bargaining power. As the individual respondents herein are also members of the governing board of the school district, appellants\u2019 activity definitely fits the \u201clegitimate basis\u201d test of <em>McKay </em>and <em>C. S. Smith Met. Market Co. </em>There is a direct nexus between the dispute and the persons being leafletted.

The Supreme Court held that Texas could insulate from the dispute a neutral establishment that industrially had no connection with it as this type of pick\u00e9ting involved little, if any, \u201ccommunication. \u201d) It seems generally to be agreed that a state cannot either by its common law or by statute prohibit the peaceful picketing of a place of business solely on the ground that the picketing is carried on by persons not employed therein. <em>{Cafeteria Union </em>v. <em>Angelos </em>(1943) 320 U.S. 293 [88 L.Ed. 58, 64 S.Ct. 126]; <em>Bakery Drivers Local </em>v. <em>Wohl </em>(1942) 315 U.S. 769 [86 L.Ed. 1178, 62 S.Ct. 816]; <em>A.
