Several PG &amp; E power transformers were struck and damaged by lightning, including two on plaintiffs\u2019 property. Plaintiffs\u2019 home lost its electricity.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-5\">Plaintiff Gail Pierce summoned PG &amp; E, whose crew arrived at about 1:30 a.m. the morning of November 22. The PG &amp; E crew, working in the rain, removed the lightning-damaged transformers from the pole and lifted their replacements into position. One of the replacements had previously been used at another location and had been removed and stored when it was no longer needed. There was no evidence that the transformer had malfunctioned in its previous location, but the PG &amp; E crew did not test the transformer before connecting it to the powerline.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-6\">The PG &amp; E crew made two of the three connections from the 12,000-volt powerline to the top of the transformers without incident, but, as a lineman attempted the third connection, the used transformer exploded in a ball of fire.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-7\">Gail observed a bit of smoke coming from the motor area of her freezer and saw a red glow in her storage shed. A fire had started in the shed. Upon closer examination Gail saw that the fire was coming from a propane gas pipe, which had ruptured.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-8\">A PG &amp; E employee who was nearby extinguished the fire and told Gail that gas was still coming out of the pipe. He asked, \u201cWhere\u2019s the shut off valve?\u201d Gail replied that she would go shut it off.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-9\">As Gail grasped the propane gas tank\u2019s shutoff valve she received a terrible shock. The shock tightened her hand around the valve and she could not let go. At some point, maybe 10 or 20 seconds later, Gail fell or slid onto the propane tank, and the force of the electricity blew her hand free of the valve. Gail tumbled away from the tank and down an embankment about six feet high. She was injured.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-10\">Plaintiffs\u2019 expert witness testified that the transformer malfunction had energized their house wiring, designed for 120 and 240 volts, with approximately 7,000 volts. Postaccident investigation revealed poorly insulated wiring and a ground wire unlawfully connecting plaintiffs\u2019 electrical system to the propane gas system.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-11\">Plaintiffs filed this action on August 28, 1979, alleging negligence and strict liability in tort for defective products. Plaintiffs\u2019 second cause of ac-</p>\n<p id=\"b95-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>tion for products liability alleged that PG &amp; E was \u201cengaged in the business of designing, manufacturing, distributing, selling, leasing, renting, to the general public electrical equipment, including the particular equipment involved in this matter.\u201d Plaintiffs\u2019 complaint did not identify the electricity itself as a defective product. PG &amp; E answered, and plaintiffs have never amended their complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-5\">The case was tried before a jury, and after plaintiffs rested PG &amp; E moved for a nonsuit on the issue of products liability. Plaintiffs responded with a motion for directed verdict. Plaintiffs\u2019 motion was premised on theories of (1) strict products liability, (2) absolute liability for ultrahazardous activity, and (3) breach of implied warranty of fitness for particular purpose. The latter two theories were not contained in plaintiffs\u2019 pleadings and were not advanced until the date of the motion (June 20, 1983), nearly four years after the case was originally filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-6\">After both sides rested the trial court denied plaintiffs\u2019 motion for directed verdict and granted PG &amp; E\u2019s motion for nonsuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-7\">The case went to the jury on the negligence cause of action, and the jury found by special verdict that PG &amp; E was not negligent. Judgment was entered for PG &amp; E. Plaintiffs\u2019 motions for judgment notwithstanding the verdict and new trial were denied, and plaintiffs filed a timely notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-8\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b95-9\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b95-10\">We first consider the trial court\u2019s entry of nonsuit on plaintiffs\u2019 second cause of action for products liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-11\">\u201cA motion for nonsuit allows a defendant to test the sufficiency of the plaintiff\u2019s evidence before presenting his or her case. Because a successful nonsuit motion precludes submission of plaintiff\u2019s case to the jury, courts grant motions for nonsuit only under very limited circumstances. <em>(Campbell </em>v. <em>General Motors Corp. </em>(1982) 32 Cal.3d 112, 117 [184 Cal.Rptr. 891, 649 P.2d 224].) A trial court must not grant a motion for nonsuit if the evidence presented by the plaintiff would support a jury verdict in the plaintiff\u2019s favor. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 117-118; <em>Ewing </em>v. <em>Cloverleaf Bowl </em>(1978) 20 Cal.3d 389, 395 [143 Cal.Rptr. 13, 572 P.2d 1155.)</p>\n<p id=\"b95-12\">\u201c \u2018In determining whether plaintiff\u2019s evidence is sufficient, the court may not weigh the evidence or consider the credibility of witnesses. Instead, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>evidence most favorable to plaintiff must be accepted as true and conflicting evidence must be disregarded. The court must give \u201cto the plaintiff[\u2019s] evidence all the value to which it is legally entitled, . . . indulging every legitimate inference which may be drawn from the evidence in plaintiff[\u2019s] favor . . . <em>(Campbell </em>v. <em>General Motors Corp., supra, </em>32 Cal.3d at p. 118, quoting <em>Elmore </em>v. <em>American Motors Corp. </em>(1969) 70 Cal.2d 578, 583 [75 Cal.Rptr. 652, 451 P.2d 84, 33 A.L.R.3d 406]; accord <em>Ewing </em>v. <em>Cloverleaf Bowl, supra, </em>20 Cal.3d at p. 395; <em>Estate of Lances </em>(1932) 216 Cal. 397, 400 [14 P.2d 768].)</p>\n<p id=\"b96-5\">\u201cIn an appeal from a judgment of nonsuit, the reviewing court is guided by the same rule requiring evaluation of the evidence in the light most favorable to the plaintiff. \u2018The judgment of the trial court cannot be sustained unless interpreting the evidence most favorably to plaintiff\u2019s case and most strongly against the defendant and resolving all presumptions, inferences and doubts in favor of the plaintiff a judgment for the defendant is required as a matter of law.\u2019 <em>(Mason </em>v. <em>Peaslee </em>(1959) 173 Cal.App.2d 587, 588 [343 P.2d 805]; accord <em>Miller </em>v. <em>Los Angeles County Flood Control Dist. </em>(1973) 8 Cal.3d 689, 699 [106 Cal.Rptr. 1, 505 P.2d 193]; <em>Hughes </em>v. <em>Oreb </em>(1951) 36 Cal.2d 854, 857 [228 P.2d 550].)\u201d <em>(Carson </em>v. <em>Facilities Development Co. </em>(1984) 36 Cal.3d 830, 838-839 [206 Cal.Rptr. 136, 686 P.2d 656].)</p>\n<p id=\"b96-6\">Plaintiffs\u2019 second cause of action was premised on the theory of strict liability in tort for defective products. Under this theory \u201cA manufacturer is strictly liable in tort when an article he places on the market, knowing that it is to be used without inspection for defects, proves to have a defect that causes injury to a human being.\u201d <em>(Greenman </em>v. <em>Yuba Power Products, Inc. </em>(1963) 59 Cal.2d 57, 62 [27 Cal.Rptr. 697, 377 P.2d 897, 13 A.L.R.3d 1049]; see <em>Hasson </em>v. <em>Ford Motor Co. </em>(1982) 32 Cal.3d 388, 406 [185 Cal.Rptr. 654, 650 P.2d 1171].) Undisputed evidence at trial established that the defective transformer was manufactured not by PG &amp; E but by Federal Pacific Electric Company, and that PG &amp; E never placed the transformer \u201con the market\u201d or in the stream of commerce. PG &amp; E was, in essence, a consumer rather than a manufacturer of the transformer, and cannot be held strictly liable in tort for the transformer\u2019s defects per se. <em>(Price </em>v. <em>Shell Oil Co. </em>(1970) 2 Cal.3d 245, 258 [85 Cal.Rptr. 178, 466 P.2d 722].)</p>\n<p id=\"b96-7\">Evidence presented at trial also established, however, that PG &amp; E\u2019s electricity arrived at plaintiffs\u2019 home at nearly 60 times its in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>tended voltage,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> ultimately causing Gail to suffer bodily injury. Plaintiffs contend that household electricity must be considered a product for strict liability purposes, that their evidence was sufficient to support a verdict in their favor, and that the entry of nonsuit was therefore erroneous. <em>(Carson </em>v. <em>Facilities Development Co., supra, </em>36 Cal.3d at pp. 838-839.)</p>\n<p id=\"b97-5\">Before we consider the merits of plaintiffs\u2019 contention, however, we must confront two jurisdictional and procedural obstacles raised by PG &amp; E.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-6\">PG &amp; E contends a \u201cdetermination\u201d that it can be held strictly liable in tort is beyond the jurisdiction of this court because it would contradict an order of the Public Utilities Commission (PUC), whose decisions are reviewable only by our highest court. (Pub. Util. Code, \u00a7 1759; <em>Waters </em>v. <em>Pacific Telephone Co. </em>(1974) 12 Cal.3d 1, 4 [114 Cal.Rptr. 753, 523 P.2d 1161].) PG &amp; E asserts the PUC has shielded it from liability for nonnegligent acts in rule 31.1 of General Order No. 95, as set out in the margin.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> PG &amp; E\u2019s argument, although ingenious, is totally without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-7\">It has long been acknowledged that the PUC has the power, by rule, to limit the liability of utilities subject to PUC regulation and supervision. <em>{Waters </em>v. <em>Pacific Telephone Co., supra, </em>12 Cal.3d at pp. 6, 10; <em>Cole </em>v. <em>Pacific Tel. &amp; Tel. Co. </em>(1952) 112 Cal.App.2d 416, 417 [246 P.2d 686]; <em>Davidian </em>v. <em>Pacific Tel. &amp; Tel. Co. </em>(1971) 16 Cal.App.3d 750, 757, fn. 3 [94 Cal.Rptr. 337].)</p>\n<p id=\"b97-8\">Although the PUC is empowered to limit utilities\u2019 liability, we conclude it has not done so in rule 31.1. Rule 31.1 provides that electrical supply <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>and communication systems shall be maintained in safe condition and specifically imposes a duty of due care to minimize the hazards involved with overhead utility wires. <em>(Perrine </em>v. <em>Pacific Gas &amp; Elec. Co. </em>(1960) 186 Cal.App.2d 442, 447 [9 Cal.Rptr. 45].) Manifestly, the rule <em>imposes </em>a duty of care and does not withdraw or limit liability. Moreover, the rule is in-apposite to the factual situation before us. This is not a case like <em>Perrine, supra, </em>where the plaintiff accidentally came into contact with the utility\u2019s overhead wires; rather, in this case a transformer which simply happened to be on an overhead pole (as opposed to in an underground vault) malfunctioned and sent extraordinarily high voltage directly into the electrical system of plaintiffs\u2019 home. Even if we were to read rule 31.1\u2019s command to \u201cbe careful\u201d with overhead wires to preclude liability without fault for overhead-wire accidents, we would not be justified in extending the rule\u2019s reach to the facts of this case. We conclude rule 31.1 does not bar imposition of strict liability in tort when the electricity <em>actually received by the consumer at her residence </em>is dangerously in excess of her reasonable expectations and the utility\u2019s intentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-4\"> PG &amp; E also contends that plaintiffs failed to plead their claim that the electricity itself, rather than the transformer, was the defective product at issue. PG &amp; E correctly points out that plaintiffs\u2019 complaint alleged their injuries were caused by defective electrical <em>equipment, </em>not defective electricity, and that plaintiffs never sought to amend their complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-5\">The general and longstanding rule is that a party must recover on the cause of action he has alleged in his complaint and not on another cause of action disclosed by the evidence. <em>(Barrere </em>v. <em>Somps </em>(1896) 113 Cal. 97, 102 [45 P. 572]; <em>Weissensee </em>v. <em>Chronicle Publishing Co. </em>(1976) 59 Cal.App.3d 723, 729 [129 Cal.Rptr. 188].) However, the general rule may yield where a case is tried on the theory that a matter is in issue and evidence is received thereon without objection. <em>(Weissensee, supra, 59 </em>Cal.App.3d at p. 729; see <em>People </em>v. <em>Toomey </em>(1984) 157 Cal.App.3d 1, 11 [203 Cal.Rptr. 642]; 4 Witkin, Cal. Procedure (2d ed. 1971) Trial, \u00a7 336, p. 3138.)</p>\n<p id=\"b98-6\">\u201c\u2018\u201cIt has long been settled law that where (1) a case is tried on the merits, (2) the issues are thoroughly explored during the course of the trial and (3) the theory of the trial is well known to court and counsel, the fact that the issues were not pleaded does not preclude an adjudication of such litigated issues and a review thereof on appeal.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Toomey, supra, </em>157 Cal.App.3d at p. 11, quoting <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Cordova Recreation &amp; Park Dist. </em>(1972) 24 Cal.App.3d 789, 794 [101 Cal.Rptr. 358].)</p>\n<p id=\"b98-8\">Here the issue of whether electricity is a product was tendered to the trial court in the following ways:</p>\n<p id=\"b99-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>The issue was first broached by PG &amp; E itself in its trial brief and motion for nonsuit on the issue of products liability.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> This trial brief was made available to the trial court several days before the hearing on the motion for nonsuit. PG &amp; E\u2019s brief anticipated the argument eventually made by plaintiffs that electricity itself is a \u201cproduct\u201d for strict tort liability purposes. At the hearing on the motion, PG &amp; E\u2019s counsel called the trial court\u2019s attention to the trial brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-5\">The trial court was also in possession of plaintiffs\u2019 memorandum of points and authorities in support of their motion for directed verdict, which made the argument that electricity is a \u201cproduct.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Plaintiffs\u2019 memorandum in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>completely cited <em>Ransome </em>v. <em>Wisconsin Elec. Power Co., supra, </em>275 N.W.2d 641, which held electricity a \u201cproduct\u201d for strict tort liability purposes. The memorandum omitted citations to the appropriate reporters. At the hearing on the nonsuit motion plaintiffs\u2019 counsel called the trial court\u2019s attention to this memorandum and tendered to the trial court a copy of \u201cthat Wisconsin case,\u201d undoubtedly referring to <em>Ransome.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b100-4\">At the hearing on the nonsuit motion, counsel for PG &amp; E again raised the argument that electricity was not a \u201cproduct.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Counsel for plaintiffs responded to this argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-5\">The trial court indicated it had reviewed and was familiar with the respective authorities submitted on the products liability issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-6\">In light of the unambiguous argument set forth in the respective memoranda, the authorities cited therein, the arguments of counsel and the trial court\u2019s expression of familiarity with those arguments, we have no doubt <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>plaintiffs\u2019 contention that electricity was a \u201cproduct\u201d was tendered to opposing counsel and the trial court itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-5\">PG &amp; E relies upon <em>Lewis </em>v. <em>South S.F. Yellow Cab Co. </em>(1949) 93 Cal.App.2d 849 [210 P.2d 62] for the proposition the trial court properly granted the nonsuit because plaintiffs failed to obtain leave to amend their complaint. A motion to amend would undoubtedly have been the prudent and lawyerlike thing to do. However, we note initially that leave to amend would in all likelihood have been granted since any amendment would have involved the \u201csame general set of facts\u201d as the original complaint, and PG &amp; E had made no showing of prejudice. <em>(Earp </em>v. <em>Nobmann </em>(1981) 122 Cal.App.3d 270, 286 [175 Cal.Rptr. 767]; see Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7\u00a7 469-471; <em>Glaser </em>v. <em>Meyers </em>(1982) 137 Cal.App.3d 770, 776-777 [187 Cal.Rptr. 242]; <em>Godfrey </em>v. <em>Steinpress </em>(1982) 128 Cal.App.3d 154, 174 [180 Cal.Rptr. 95].) Later authorities have not followed the strict rule of <em>Lewis </em>but have reasoned that if the proof is presented and the issue clearly tendered, the failure formally to amend the pleading is immaterial. (See <em>Donovan </em>v. <em>Wechsler </em>(1970) 11 Cal.App.3d 210, 213 [89 Cal.Rptr. 669]; 8 Cal. Practice (2d ed. 1981) Pleading\u2014Civil Actions, \u00a7 1097, p. 405.) Here, we have no doubt that defendant and, more importantly, the trial court were fully put on notice and informed of plaintiff\u2019s theory of liability. In these circumstances, the purpose of an amendment to the complaint was satisfied. Plaintiffs\u2019 failure to amend does not bar their pursuit of liability on a theory that electricity was a defective product.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-6\">We come to plaintiffs\u2019 major contention on appeal: that the electricity PG &amp; E furnishes to consumers is a product rather than a service. (See <em>Shepard </em>v. <em>Alexian Brothers Hosp. </em>(1973) 33 Cal.App.3d 606, 608-609 [109 Cal.Rptr. 132]; <em>Allied Properties </em>v. <em>John A. Blume &amp; Associates </em>(1972) 25 Cal.App.3d 848, 855 [102 Cal.Rptr. 259]; Cal. Products Liability Actions (rev. ed. 1984) \u00a7 2.02[1], p. 2-23.)</p>\n<p id=\"b101-7\">PG &amp; E claims that electricity is merely the motion of charged ions and is not an \u201carticle\u201d as described by <em>Greenman. </em>The courts, however, have not dwelled unduly on electricity\u2019s physical properties.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Over 20 years ago the California Court of Appeal recognized that \u201cElectricity is a commodity which, like other goods, can be manufactured, transported and sold.\u201d <em>(Baldwin-Lima-Hamilton Corp. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1962) 208 Cal.App.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>803, 819 [25 Cal.Rptr. 798].)<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Although we have found no California case which has considered the issue in the strict tort liability context, the courts of other states have had little trouble in concluding that electricity delivered to homes and businesses is a \u201cproduct.\u201d (See, e.g., <em>Petroski </em>v. <em>Northern Indiana Public Service Company </em>(1976) 171 Ind.App. 14 [354 N.E.2d 736, 747]; <em>Hedges </em>v. <em>Public Serv. Co. </em>(Ind.App. 1979) 396 N.E.2d 933, 935; <em>Ransome </em>v. <em>Wisconsin Elec. Power Co., supra, </em>275 N.W.2d at p. 647; <em>Elgin Airport Inn </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, supra, </em>410 N.E.2d at p. 623; see also <em>Farina </em>v. <em>Niagara Mohawk Power Corp. </em>(1981) 81 App.Div.2d 700 [438 N.Y.S.2d 645, 646]; <em>Genaust </em>v. <em>Illinois Power Company </em>(1976) 62 Ill.2d 456 [343 N.E.2d 465, 469-470, 82 A.L.R.3d 285] [assuming arguendo that electricity is a \u201cproduct\u201d].) As the Supreme Court of Wisconsin aptly put it, \u201cThe distribution might well be a service, but the electricity itself, in the contemplation of the ordinary user, is a consumable product.\u201d <em>{Ransome </em>v. <em>Wisconsin Elec. Power Co., supra, </em>275 N.W.2d at p. 643.)</p>\n<p id=\"b102-4\">PG &amp; E relies on <em>Shepard </em>v. <em>Alexian Brothers Hosp., supra, </em>33 Cal.App.3d 606, and <em>Fogo </em>v. <em>Cutter Laboratories, Inc. </em>(1977) 68 Cal.App.3d 744 [137 Cal.Rptr. 417], to support its argument that provision of electricity is a service rather than a product. Both cases are readily distinguishable.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-5\"><em>Shepard </em>and <em>Fogo </em>relied in part on Health and Safety Code section 1606, which legislatively answered the question there presented, that supply of blood and blood products was a service rather than a sale. <em>{Shepard, </em>33 Cal.App.3d at p. 609; <em>Fogo, </em>68 Cal.App.3d at p. 752.) <em>Shepard </em>and <em>Fogo </em>also noted that some defects in blood products were inevitable, and that no policy reason existed to impose absolute liability on the supplier for defects it could not avoid. <em>{Shepard, </em>at pp. 611-612; <em>Fogo, </em>at pp. 752-753.) Here, evidence at trial suggested the accident could have been avoided through testing transformers but testing would have been more costly than the alternative.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b103-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>We readily acknowledge that PG &amp; E\u2019s liability should not depend simply upon whether electricity is or is not labeled a \u201cproduct.\u201d More significantly, we believe the policy justifications for strict liability in tort support its imposition in this case. (See <em>Daly </em>v. <em>General Motors Corp. </em>(1978) 20 Cal.3d 725, 736 [575 P.2d 1162].)  This court has identified four main policy grounds for the doctrine: (1) to provide a \u201cshort cut\u201d to liability where negligence may be present but is difficult to prove; (2) to provide an economic incentive for improved product safety; (3) to induce the reallocation of resources toward safer products; and (4) to spread the risk of loss among all who use the product. <em>(McDonald </em>v. <em>Sacramento Medical Foundation Blood Bank </em>(1976) 62 Cal.App.3d 866, 874 [133 Cal.Rptr. 444]; see 50 Cal.Jur.3d, Products Liability, \u00a7 17, p. 809; see also <em>Cronin </em>v. <em>J.B.E. Olson Corp. </em>(1972) 8 Cal.3d 121, 133 [104 Cal.Rptr. 433, 501 P.2d 1153]; <em>Escola </em>v. <em>Coca-Cola Bottling Co. </em>(1944) 24 Cal.2d 453, 461-462 [150 P.2d 436] (Traynor, J., cone.).)</p>\n<p id=\"b103-5\">Proof of negligence in cases such as this requires a plaintiff to present to a jury evidence of the inner workings of an electrical power system of vast and complex proportions. The technical operation of such systems and of electricity itself is far beyond the knowledge of the average juror. The expert witnesses who can explain such systems to the jury are concentrated within the industry itself and may be reluctant to serve as expert witnesses in plaintiff\u2019s cases. Moreover, PG &amp; E is in a much better position than a consumer-plaintiff to diagnose\u2014and ultimately to correct\u2014 the failures which inevitably occur in systems of such magnitude.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-6\">In addition, where, as here, a huge surge of injury-causing electricity is traceable to a defective component (the transformer) in the utility\u2019s system, imposition of strict liability creates an incentive for utilities to <em>avoid </em>accidents before they occur, by investing in safer products. Although, as PG &amp; E notes, its current practices and procedures are extensively regulated by the PUC and its General Order 95, the PUC has certainly not forbidden testing transformers before they are connected to 12,000-volt powerlines. Nothing in the record suggests the PUC is of the view that electric utility procedures are incapable of being made safer.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-7\">Finally, strict liability in tort spreads the costs of personal injuries among millions of consumers of electricity instead of imposing those costs upon blameless victims chosen by chance. It is proper that those who seek to benefit from a product should bear the associated costs and should not ask the unfortunate but inevitable victims selected (literally) by accident to bear the burden unaided.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-8\">We conclude that PG &amp; E, as a commercial supplier of electricity, is subject to strict liability in tort for personal injuries caused by delivery <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>of electricity at dangerously high voltage due to a defective transformer. Accordingly, the trial court\u2019s entry of nonsuit was error. <em>(Carson </em>v. <em>Facilities Development Co., supra, </em>36 Cal.3d at pp. 838-839.)</p>\n<p id=\"b104-4\">We emphasize that our holding is limited to cases where the electricity is actually in the \u201cstream of commerce,\u201d and expected to be at marketable voltage. In most cases this will mean the electricity must be delivered to the customer\u2019s premises, to the point where it is metered, although the many variations in electrical systems prevent our drawing a \u201cbright line\u201d at a particular point.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> We concur in the limitations uniformly adopted by other jurisdictions which have excluded the \u201cantenna cases\u201d [plaintiff, installing TV antenna, accidentally touches antenna to powerline] and the \u201cplaintiff-touches-downed-power-line\u201d cases from liability-without-fault because in those cases contact with the power line comes at a point where the electricity is not in the stream of commerce or is not in marketable form. (See <em>Genaust </em>v. <em>Illinois Power Company, supra, </em>343 N.E.2d at p. 470; <em>Farina </em>v. <em>Niagara Mohawk Power Corp., supra, </em>438 N.Y.S.2d at p. 646; <em>Hedges </em>v. <em>Public Serv. Co. of Indiana, Inc., supra, </em>396 N.E.2d at p. 935.)<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Moreover, in such cases (as with cases where dangerously high voltage is attributable to acts of God), the utility generally cannot prevent the accident using reasonably available means. (Cf. <em>Shepard </em>v. <em>Alexian Brothers Hosp., supra, </em>33 Cal.App.3d at pp. 611-612; <em>Fogo </em>v. <em>Cutter Laboratories, Inc., supra, </em>68 Cal.App.3d at pp. 752-753.)</p>\n<p id=\"b104-5\">Nor do we have occasion in this case to examine whether a commercial supplier of electricity should be strictly liable for property damage or for any specie of damage caused by delivery of electricity at <em>less than </em>marketable voltage, i.e., damage caused by a \u201cbrown-out.\u201d Those situations may well involve policy considerations not present in the scenario currently before us.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b105-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>n</p>\n<p id=\"b105-5\">Plaintiffs also contend the trial court erred in denying their motion for directed verdict on the issue of ultrahazardous activity, as liability was established as a matter of law. Plaintiffs are mistaken.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-6\">The doctrine of ultrahazardous activity provides that one who undertakes an ultrahazardous activity is liable to every person who is injured as a proximate result of that activity, regardless of the amount of care he uses. <em>(McKenzie </em>v. <em>Pacific Gas &amp; Elec. Co. </em>(1962) 200 Cal.App.2d 731, 736 [19 Cal.Rptr. 628]; see 4 Witkin, Summary of Cal. Law (8th ed. 1974) Torts, \u00a7\u00a7 799-808, pp. 3096-3104.) The doctrine of ultrahazardous activity focuses not on a product and its defects but upon an activity intentionally undertaken by the defendant, which by its nature is very dangerous. In this case it is of course true that the ultimate result of the transformer failure was very hazardous: over 7,000 volts of electricity were sent into a residential electrical system designed for no more than 240 volts. However, the doctrine scrutinizes not the accident itself but the activity which led up to the accident\u2014in this case, the maintenance of high-voltage powerlines and transformers. Thus, the issue is whether maintenance of high-voltage power systems by public utilities is an ultrahazardous activity. We conclude it is not.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-7\">Our Supreme Court has limited the doctrine of ultrahazardous activity to encompass only activities which are neither commonplace nor customary. <em>(Luthringer </em>v. <em>Moore </em>(1948) 31 Cal.2d 489, 498 [190 P.2d 1].) In this case the allegedly ultrahazardous activity has become pervasive and is now entirely commonplace. (See, e.g., <em>Clark </em>v. <em>Di Prima </em>(1966) 241 Cal.App.2d 823 [51 Cal.Rptr. 49] [water escaping irrigation ditch; no liability as ditches now in widespread use].) We therefore join the court in <em>McKenzie </em>v. <em>Pacific Gas &amp; Elec. Co., supra, </em>200 Cal.App.2d 731, in concluding that maintenance of electric power lines is not \u201cultrahazardous.\u201d (P. 736.) The trial court\u2019s refusal to direct a verdict for plaintiffs on this issue was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-8\">HI</p>\n<p id=\"b105-9\">Plaintiffs next contend the trial court should have directed a verdict in their favor on the issue of implied warranty of fitness for particular purpose (Cal.U.Com.Code, \u00a7 2315). Nothing in plaintiffs\u2019 complaint indicated they were pursuing a theory of implied warranty. We conclude that this issue, unlike the products liability and ultrahazardous activity issues, involved questions of fact and law which were outside plaintiffs\u2019 pleadings and were not fairly tendered to defendant at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>The implied warranty of fitness for particular purpose has been codified in section 2315 of the California Uniform Commercial Code, which provides that \u201cWhere the seller at the time of contracting has reason to know any particular purpose for which the goods are required and that the buyer is relying on the seller\u2019s skill or judgment to select or furnish suitable goods, there is <em>unless excluded or modified under the next section </em>an implied warranty that the goods shall be fit for such purpose.\u201d (Italics added.)<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The next section, section 2316, provides in pertinent part that \u201cto exclude or modify any implied warranty of fitness the exclusion must be by a writing and conspicuous. Language to exclude all implied warranties of fitness is sufficient if it states, for example, that \u2018There are no warranties which extend beyond the description on the face hereof.\u2019\u201d (Cal.U.Com.Code, \u00a7 2316, subd. (2).) Section 2316 also provides that \u201cAn implied warranty can also be excluded or modified by course of dealing or course of performance or usage of trade.\u201d (Cal.U.Com.Code, \u00a7 2316, subd. (3)(c).)</p>\n<p id=\"b106-4\">Plaintiffs first raised the implied warranty issue in their motion for directed verdict filed some four years after their complaint. Plaintiffs\u2019 motion did not allege that the implied warranty was not excluded or modified pursuant to section 2316, nor did plaintiffs present any evidence at trial suggesting the implied warranty was in force at the time of the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-5\">PG &amp; E objected that the implied warranty issue was not timely raised. PG &amp; E observed that unanswered questions remained as to the status of any implied warranty and noted that no discovery had been undertaken on the issue. Unlike the products liability issue, the particulars of the implied warranty issue were neither \u201cwell known to court and counsel\u201d nor \u201cthoroughly explored during the course of the trial.\u201d <em>(.People </em>v. <em>Toomey, supra, </em>157 Cal.App.3d at p. 11.) That being the case, plaintiffs\u2019 failure to plead the implied warranty issue bars recovery on that ground. <em>{Barrere </em>v. <em>Somps, supra, </em>113 Cal. at p. 102; <em>Weissensee </em>v. <em>Chronicle Publishing Co., supra, </em>59 Cal.App.3d at p. 729.) The trial court\u2019s refusal to direct a verdict on the issue was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b106-7\">Plaintiffs finally raise two instructional errors on the negligence cause of action. Plaintiffs\u2019 claim the trial court erred in refusing to instruct <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>with a modified form of BAJI No. 9.21, dealing with commercial suppliers\u2019 duty of reasonable care.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The instruction provides, in part, that the supplier must exercise reasonable care in testing and inspecting component parts made by others.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-5\">In light of our conclusion in part I, <em>ante, </em>that electricity is a \u201cproduct,\u201d we hold that plaintiffs\u2019 requested instruction was a correct statement of the law. PG &amp; E contends, however, that the instruction was duplicative of matters adequately covered in other instructions and that its omission was harmless error. We agree with PG &amp; E.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-6\">The trial court instructed with BAJI Nos. 3.10, 3.11, 3.12, and plaintiffs\u2019 instruction based on PUC rule 31.1.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Although the proffered instruction focused more clearly than the others upon the commercial supplier\u2019s duty to perform reasonable testing and inspection of component parts furnished</p>\n<p id=\"b108-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>by others, we conclude the point is adequately covered in plaintiffs\u2019 instruction based on PUC rule 31.1, which requires that <em>entire electrical systems, </em>necessarily including <em>all </em>component parts, be in such condition as to operate safely. (See fn. 14, ante.) We cannot say, after examining the entire cause, that it is reasonably probable a result more favorable to plaintiffs would have been reached had the proposed instruction been given. <em>(Seaman\u2019s Direct Buying Service, Inc. </em>v. <em>Standard Oil Co. </em>(1984) 36 Cal.3d 752, 770 [206 Cal.Rptr. 354, 686 P.2d 1158]; see <em>LeMons </em>v. <em>Regents of University of California </em>(1978) 21 Cal.3d 869, 876 [148 Cal.Rptr. 355, 582 P.2d 946].)</p>\n<p id=\"b108-4\">Plaintiffs finally contend the trial court erred in refusing to instruct with BAJI No. 3.45 (negligence per se\u2014violation of a statute) based upon PUC rule 31.1. However, rule 31.1 is merely a statement of the common law rule of due care and cannot be the basis of negligence per se. <em>(Perrine </em>v. <em>Pacific Gas &amp; Elec. Co., supra, </em>186 Cal.App.2d at p. 447; <em>Lewis </em>v. <em>Pacific Gas &amp; Electric Co. </em>(1949) 95 Cal.App.2d 60, 63 [212 P.2d 243].) The trial court correctly refused the instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-5\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b108-6\">The judgment (order) granting nonsuit on the issue of strict liability in tort is reversed and the matter is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. In all other respects the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-7\">Sparks, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b97-9\">Thus, the electricity was \u201cdefective,\u201d as that term is used in strict tort liability cases. \u201cIn general, a manufacturing or production defect is readily identifiable because <em>a defective product is one that differs from the manufacturer\u2019s intended result </em>or from other ostensibly identical units of the same product line.\u201d <em>(Barker </em>v. <em>Lull Engineering Co. </em>(1978) 20 Cal.3d 413, 429 [143 Cal.Rptr. 225, 573 P.2d 443, 96 A.L.R.3d 1], italics added.) It is undisputed that 120-240 volts was the voltage normally distributed to residential consumers and was the voltage plaintiffs actually purchased for their house. (See <em>Ransome </em>v. <em>Wisconsin Elec. Power Co. </em>(1979) 87 Wis.2d 605 [275 N.W.2d 641, 649].) It goes without saying that 7,000 volts was far in excess of PG &amp; E\u2019s intended result and in excess, as well, of plaintiffs\u2019 reasonable expectations. Moreover, the electricity actually delivered was unsafe. \u201cWhen a product fails to satisfy . . . ordinary consumer expectations as to safety in its intended or reasonably foreseeable operation, a manufacturer is strictly liable for resulting injuries.\u201d <em>(Barker </em>v. <em>Lull Engineering Co., supra, </em>20 Cal.3d at p. 430, and cases cited.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b97-10\">\u201cElectrical supply and communication systems shall be of suitable design and construction for their intended use, regard being given to the conditions under which they are to be operated, and shall be maintained in a condition which will enable the furnishing of safe, proper and adequate service.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-11\">\u201cThe owners and employees of such systems shall at all times <em>exercise due care to reduce to a minimum </em>the hazard of accidental injury to their own or fellow employees, to the public and other utilities due to the presence of overhead wires.\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b99-6\">PG &amp; E\u2019s trial brief and motion for nonsuit provided in pertinent part that: \u201cPGandE expects the plaintiffs to request product liability instructions on the basis that <em>electricity </em>is a product, although their pleadings refer only to <em>equipment. </em>(See, Complaint, [f] 2, p. 5.) This is an attempt to \u2018bootstrap\u2019 their defective transformer theory to the jury. If <em>any </em>product was defective it was the <em>transformer. </em>But because PGandE only uses transformers and never sells or places them in the stream of commerce, a products liability theory must fail. In addition, electricity is a service, not a product.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-7\">\u201cStrict product liability is not imposed on a person who furnishes a service rather than a product. <em>{Allied Props, </em>v. <em>John A.

Simply stated, it is a <em>force, </em>like the wind, with the <em>potential </em>to do work. Electricity alone cannot perform work. Electricity alone is useless from a consumer\u2019s point of view. Electricity is a stream of electrons that is created, transmitted, distributed, and converted to energy, all within milliseconds. <em>No California court has ever held that electricity is a product.\u201d </em>(Italics in original.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b99-9\">Plaintiffs\u2019 memorandum of points and authorities provided in pertinent part that: \u201cElectricity itself is a product. \u2018 \u201cProduct\u201d means any object possessing intrinsic value, capable of delivery either as an assembled whole or as a component part or parts, and produced for introduction into trade or commerce.\u2019 Model Uniform Product Liability Act 44 Fed. Reg. 62, 714, 62, 717 (1979). It also has been recognized as a product under the Restatement of Torts 2d \u00a7 402A by the Wisconsin Supreme Court in <em>Ransome </em>v. <em>Wisconsin Electrical Power Co. </em>(1979). In Illinois, although they assumed electricity was a \u201cproduct,\u201d arguendo, they decided it cannot be held that wires fall within the definition of packaging for injuries received when an electrical current arced from uninsulated wires. The Illinois Supreme Court rationalized that the electricity was not contended to be defective and it was still in an unmarketable state not having been released into the stream of commerce by sale or display to the customer when the plaintiff touched the wire while erecting an antenna. <em>Genaust </em>v. <em>Illinois Power Company, </em>62 Ill 2d 456, 434 N.E. 2d 465, 82 ALR 3d 205.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-10\">\u201cUnlike the facts of <em>Genaust </em>v. <em>Illinois Power Company, </em>supra, in the case at bar the electricity was in the process of being released or had already been released into the stream of commerce; and, in the act of doing so, defendant permitted the electricity to escape into plaintiff\u2019s residence in an unsafe form. The defendant claims that its transformer was unexpectedly defective at the time of the reinstallation. The transformer had proved not to be defective in prior use by defendant. Whether the mishap resulted from a defect in defendant\u2019s equipment that arose while in defendant\u2019s possession, or resulted from the faulty conduct of the employees during the present installation of the transformer, defendant should be subject to strict liability in tort. As a commercial supplier of a product dangerous unless safeguarded, all of the usual policy arguments dictate that defendant be held strictly liable in tort and should now bear plaintiff\u2019s burden of loss because her injuries were caused by a defect in either the power supplied, the equipment used by defendant to supply the electricity, or both.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b100-7\">At the hearing on the motion for nonsuit PG &amp; E\u2019s counsel argued: \u201cLet me start, your Honor, with suggesting that the Court can, and I\u2019m sorry, I can\u2019t remember the precise number, under Evidence Code Section 451,1 believe it is, and I believe shall take judicial notice of the rules and regulations of the California Public Utilities Commission, Rule 16, your Honor, which I have already here in front of me, reads in part as such, all transformers, meters, service wires, et cetera, installed by the utility, at its expense, upon the applicant\u2019s premises for the purpose of delivery of electricity, energy, to the applicant, shall continue to be the property of the utility.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-8\">\u201cNow, your Honor, they\u2019ve got a defective transformer their guy testifies.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-9\">\u201cThey\u2019ve got evidence that that transformer was defective, they\u2019ve got a negligence theory which is enough to get them to a jury, and we\u2019re not suggesting otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-10\">\u201cThey can get to a jury on the negligence theory.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-11\">\u201cThat transformer, your Honor, was never sold to anybody, and the rules set down by the California Public Utilities Commission are that it remains the property of PG &amp; E, if it\u2019s not put into the stream of commerce, a products liability cause of action cannot lie.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-12\">\u201cNow they\u2019re talking about electricity, which is simply a way to backdoor the transformer in.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-13\">\u201cNow, counsel referred to Bell versus Industrial VanGas, a case with which I\u2019m quite familiar, and it\u2019s a case that went up either on a demurrer or a.summary judgment, I can\u2019t recall which, on a dual capacity theory, and a salesman was delivering propane gas to a customer when the canister of gas exploded and injured the salesman, and the court held that for purposes of dual capacity that that was a products liability, because there\u2019s that canister of gas that he\u2019s delivering to a customer, and the canister explodes and injures the salesman.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-14\">\u201cFrankly, your Honor, I have great difficulty in seeing what that\u2019s got to do with electricity and what that\u2019s got to do with [the] transformer, which remain on the property of P G &amp; E, both in fact and according to CPUC rules.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-15\">\u201cCounsel has in his papers cited one case in the United States that has ever held that electricity is a product, and that case is in Wisconsin, but no court in California, your Honor, has ever so held, and as your Honor no doubt knows there have been many, many cases involving electric utilities in the years since Greenman established products liability in California.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b100-16\">\u201cIt\u2019s simply a way of backdooring the transformer theory to the jury, and they can\u2019t get the transformer in, your Honor, because it simply never entered the stream of commerce.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b101-8\">While courts have not dwelled, others have. \u201cBecause electricity is intangible, it has consistently been argued by strict liability defendants in cases involving injury by electricity that the intangible force of electrical current is not a \u2018product\u2019 within the meaning of [the Restatement of Torts], . . .\u201d <em>(Baldwin Airport Inn </em>v. <em>Commonwealth </em>(1980) 88 Ill.App.3d <em>All </em>[410 N.E.2 620, 623].)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b102-6\">PG &amp; E\u2019s other principal product provides an apt analogy: if by some fluke a PG &amp; E gas line delivered not methane gas but highly explosive hydrogen gas to a customer\u2019s range or dryer, with predictable results, we would have little trouble concluding that gas is a \u201cproduct\u201d for tort liability purposes.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b102-7\"><em>Shepard </em>noted that a hospital\u2019s supplying of blood \u201cis entirely subordinate to its paramount function of furnishing trained personnel and specialized facilities in an endeavor to restore the patient\u2019s health. . . .

J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ay\">I respectfully dissent from the result only; I fully concur in the rationale of the majority opinion that Pacific Gas and Electric Company (hereafter P. G. &amp; E.) or any commercial supplier of electricity may be subject to strict liability in tort for personal injuries caused by delivery of electricity under certain conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-9\">However, I do not view that reasoning to be applicable to the posture in which I view the facts of the case. Nothing in plaintiffs\u2019 pleadings or in the evidence relative to defective electricity was tendered to the defendant prior to or at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-10\">Plaintiffs\u2019 complaint did not directly or impliedly assert liability predicated upon a defect in the electricity supplied by P. G. &amp; E.; the complaint was patently clear in its assertion that the plaintiffs considered the defective product to be the transformer and not the electricity. The only evidence presented by plaintiffs on the question of causation was directed to the transformer. Plaintiffs\u2019 only expert, Dr. James Gordon Simes, confined his tes<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>timony to the deficiencies of the transformer and not on faulty or defective electricity. Moreover, counsel for plaintiffs conceded during argument on defendant\u2019s motion for nonsuit that, in his opinion, his expert had established product liability on the theory of a defective transformer. In that connection, the evidence was uncontroverted that P. G. &amp; E. was a buyer and user of the transformer, not the designer, manufacturer, or distributor. I would conclude under the factual and procedural circumstances that the question of strict liability in tort for defective electricity involved issues of law and fact dehors the evidence and pleadings, and those issues were not fairly tendered to defendant at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-5\">Plaintiffs could have pleaded and presented such a cause and legal theory. They did not. The issue was raised by plaintiffs\u2019 counsel in responding to defendant\u2019s motion for nonsuit. As the majority opinion concludes on the question of implied warranty, I would also conclude on the question of strict liability for defective electricity, that the particulars of that issue, not the question of a defective transformer, was neither \u201c \u2018 \u201cwell known to court and counsel\u201d \u2019 \u201d nor \u201c \u2018 \u201cthoroughly explored during the course of the trial.\u2019\u201d\u201d <em>{People </em>v. <em>Toomey </em>(1984) 157 Cal.App.3d 1, 11 [203 Cal.Rptr. 642].) I would conclude that by reason of plaintiffs\u2019 failure to plead or present at trial a strict liability cause of action predicated upon defective electricity supplied by P. G. &amp; E., they are barred from recovery on that basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-6\">I would affirm the judgment in its entirety.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
