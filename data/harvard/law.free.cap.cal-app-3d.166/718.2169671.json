J.</author>\n<p id=\"Atu\">A four-count information charged self-styled tax protester Max R. McLemore with wilfully failing to file state income tax returns with the intent to evade taxes for the years 1977 through 1980 in violation of Revenue and Taxation Code section 19406.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> McLemore negotiated a plea bargain in which he pleaded nolo contendere to violating section 19401,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> a misdemeanor, for failing to file income tax returns for those years preserving his right on this appeal to pursue the argument he unsuccessfully made to the trial court.  McLemore contends he was excused from filing state income tax returns because of his privilege against self-incrimination contained in article I, section 15 of the California Constitution. Guided principally by <em>United States </em>v. <em>Carlson </em>(9th Cir. 1980) 617 F.2d 518 we reject his argument and affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-9\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b541-10\">McLemore believes the government may not validly collect an income tax on wages earned. Eschewing a direct challenge to the state or federal government\u2019s authority to tax, but nonetheless determined to defeat the government\u2019s withholding system, McLemore filed a false withholding exemption certificate for each of the years 1977 through 1980. Although his annual wages ranged from $18,000 to $40,000 McLemore certified under penalty of perjury that he was exempt from federal income taxes. Recognizing this act is punishable under 26 United States Code section 7205, he now claims he cannot be prosecuted for failing to file a California state income tax return because to do so in effect would compel him to incriminate himself <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"720\">*720</page-number>as to the false withholding certificate.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The reason for this is that California and federal statutes provide for reciprocal sharing of taxpayer information between the Franchise Tax Board and the Internal Revenue Service. (See \u00a7 19286; 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6103(d).)</p>\n<p id=\"b542-4\">On virtually identical facts, <em>United States </em>v. <em>Carlson, supra, </em>617 F.2d 518 held the Fifth Amendment does not shield a taxpayer from a prosecution for failure to file a complete income tax return where information on the return would likely indicate that the taxpayer previously filed a false withholding certificate. In reaching this conclusion, the <em>Carlson </em>court read <em>California </em>v. <em>Byers </em>(1971) 402 U.S. 424 [29 L.Ed.2d 9, 91 S.Ct. 1535] for the proposition that the Supreme Court has recognized the privilege against self-incrimination is not absolute. Rather, the individual\u2019s need for protection must be balanced against the government\u2019s need for information. <em>(Carlson, supra, </em>617 F.2d at p. 521 and fn. 5.) In applying this analysis, the court noted that Carlson\u2019s initial crime\u2014the false withholding certificate\u2014 was an integral part of an overall plan to evade payment of his income tax. Thus, the Fifth Amendment privilege was not an after-the-fact shield to protect Carlson from a government inquisition but rather a premeditated sword to implement his tax protest philosophy. <em>(Id., </em>at p. 522.) On the other side of the ledger, the court recognized that the efficacy and equity of the income tax system depend on accurate self-reporting by individual taxpayers. <em>(Id., </em>at p. 523.) Carlson further observed that the objective of the tax return filing requirement, as evidenced by the broad scope of persons to whom it applies, is not to elicit incriminatory information but rather to make possible the collection of government revenue. <em>(Ibid.) </em>This may be contrasted with reporting requirements directed at a \u201chighly selective group inherently suspect of criminal activities.\u201d <em>(Albertson </em>v. <em>SACB </em>(1965) 382 U.S. 70, 79 [15 L.Ed.2d 165, 172, 86 S.Ct. 194]; see <em>California </em>v. <em>Byers, supra, </em>402 U.S. at pp. 429-430 [29 L.Ed.2d at p. 18].) In Carlson\u2019s circumstances, the court concluded the interests sought to be protected by the Fifth Amendment privilege did not warrant its application to shield a patent tax evasion scheme. (617 F.2d at p. 523.)</p>\n<p id=\"b542-5\">It is well-established federal law that the Fifth Amendment privilege does not extend to a taxpayer\u2019s failure to file any tax return at all. <em>(United States </em>v. <em>Sullivan </em>(1927) 274 U.S. 259, 263-264 [71 L.Ed. 1037, 1039-1040, 47 S.Ct. 607, 51 A.L.R. 1020].) The procedure the taxpayer must follow is to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"721\">*721</page-number>file a return and specifically object to providing requested information he believes may incriminate him. <em>(Ibid; </em>see also <em>United States </em>v. <em>Neff </em>(9th Cir. 1980) 615 F.2d 1235, 1238.) While reliance on <em>Sullivan </em>would easily dispose of the case before us\u2014since McLemore filed no return at all\u2014we agree with the <em>Carlson </em>court that <em>Sullivan </em>cannot be justified by the fiction that the mere filing of a return is not incriminatory. (617 F.2d at p. 521, fn. 5.) Rather, the correctness of the <em>Sullivan </em>result follows from proper application of the balancing process articulated in <em>California </em>v. <em>Byers </em>and applied in <em>Carlson. </em>We note in this context that McLemore\u2019s failure to file, a tax return has not only deprived the Franchise Tax Board of important information; it effectively deprived the state of revenue as well, thus substantially magnifying the importance of the governmental interest in requiring that a return be filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-5\">McLemore places extensive reliance on the California Supreme Court decision in <em>Byers </em>v. <em>Justice Court, supra, </em>71 Cal.2d 1039, in which the court held that a motor vehicle operator\u2019s Fifth Amendment rights were violated where he was compelled by the state\u2019s \u201chit-and-run\u201d law to stop following an automobile accident and furnish his name and address to the driver of the other vehicle and where such information was later used to prosecute the operator for a Vehicle Code violation which contributed to the cause of the accident. McLemore\u2019s reliance on <em>Byers </em>v. <em>Justice Court </em>is curious in that the California Supreme Court\u2019s opinion was vacated by the United States Supreme Court in an opinion holding that no Fifth Amendment violation had occurred. <em>(California </em>v. <em>Byers, supra, </em>402 U.S. 424.) We infer from McLemore\u2019s reliance on the state constitution that he is attempting to suggest that <em>Byers </em>v. <em>Justice Court </em>indicates a proper interpretation of the state constitutional protection against self-incrimination. (See also <em>Ramona R. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1985) 37 Cal.3d 802 [210 Cal.Rptr. 204, 693 P.2d 789].) <em>Byers </em>v. <em>Justice Court, </em>however, was decided on strictly federal grounds relying on a line of U.S. Supreme Court cases which was clarified in <em>California </em>v. <em>Byers. </em>The California Supreme Court took no opportunity on remand of the case to articulate an \u201cindependent state ground\u201d for its holding. (Compare <em>People </em>v. <em>Ramos </em>(1984) 37 Cal.3d 136, 142, 159 [207 Cal.Rptr. 800, 689 P.2d 430].) We can thus find no reason to conclude that <em>Byers </em>v. <em>Justice Court, </em>given its subsequent history, is supportive of McLemore\u2019s argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-6\">Even were <em>Byers </em>v. <em>Justice Court </em>arguably suggestive of an independent state constitutional standard, however, we would not be inclined to articulate it in the present case where, as a practical matter, such an independent standard would be meaningless. Even if McLemore\u2019s failure to file a state return were deemed privileged, his filing of a federal return would still be mandated under <em>United States </em>v. <em>Carlson, supra, </em>617 F.2d 518. The incrim<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"722\">*722</page-number>mating information in his state return which McLemore seeks to protect is thus already available to the federal government, on which it can base a charge of filing a false withholding certificate. We prefer to limit invocation of the independent state grounds rationale, in circumstances in which we may do so (see <em>In re Lance W. </em>(1985) 37 Cal.3d 873 [210 Cal.Rptr. 631, 694 P.2d 744]), to only those situations where it will make some meaningful difference.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-4\">Accordingly, we conclude McLemore\u2019s conviction on a charge of failing to file a tax return did not violate his privilege against self-incrimination guaranteed by the California Constitution.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b544-5\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b544-6\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-7\">Work, J., and Butler, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-8\">Appellant\u2019s petition for review by the Supreme Court was denied July 17, 1985.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b541-11\">Unless otherwise specified all statutory references are to the Revenue and Taxation Code.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b541-12\">At the time of the violations alleged in the information section 19401 provided in part: \u201cAny person who, with or without intent to evade any requirement of this part or any lawful requirement of the Franchise Tax Board under this part, fails to file any return or to supply any information required under this part, or who, with or without such intent, makes, renders, signs, or verifies any false or fraudulent return or statement, or supplies any false or fraudulent information, is liable to a penalty of not more than one thousand dollars ($1,000). . . . [1] . . . [and] is also guilty of a misdemeanor . . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b542-6\">McLemore concedes under the rationale of <em>Byers </em>v. <em>Justice Court </em>(1969) 71 Cal.2d 1039 [80 Cal.Rptr. 553, 458 P.2d 465], that the state may validly require the filing of a tax return, no matter how incriminatory, as long as the information in the return is not used to prosecute the taxpayer for prior criminal conduct. Consistent with <em>Byers, </em>however, he argues he cannot be prosecuted for failure to file a return until a \u201cuse restriction\u201d standard has been articulated and applied by a California court. {Id., at p. 1058.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b544-9\">McLemore attempts to raise an additional issue, arguing in effect that even if he cannot validly claim the privilege against self-incrimination as a defense, his good faith in invoking the privilege negates the mental state of \u201cwillfulness\u201d necessary to support his conviction. (See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Carlson, supra, </em>617 F.2d at pp. 523-524.) In making this argument, McLemore ignores the fact that his plea of nolo contendere admitted all facts necessary to the conviction (see <em>People </em>v. <em>Padfield </em>(1982) 136 Cal.App.3d 218, 228 [185 Cal.Rptr. 903]), which includes the existence of the requisite mental state. Furthermore, his statement of grounds for appeal do not include any argument regarding mental state and for that reason alone renders his claim not cognizable. (Pen. Code, \u00a7 1237.5.) Moreover, while McLemore was originally <em>charged </em>with a crime which requires a \u201cwillful\u201d mental state (\u00a7 19406), the crime of which he was <em>convicted </em>(\u00a7 19401) includes no such requirement.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
