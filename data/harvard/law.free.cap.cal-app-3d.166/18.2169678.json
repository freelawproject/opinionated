Alameda Improvement Association, Inc., which by leave of court had intervened in the action, has appealed from the judgment; defendant City of Alameda has not.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-4\">The superior court had concluded, despite the charter city \u201chome rule\u201d provisions of the state\u2019s Constitution, article XI, section 5, subdivision (a), that the Legislature\u2019s enactment of Government Code section 65008 had preempted the field purportedly covered by Measure I, with which it (section 65008) was in conflict.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-5\">Measure I contained the following language: \u201cFor a period of five years no more government subsidized rental housing units shall be developed in the City of Alameda, unless development of such rental units is first approved by a majority of the voters in the City of Alameda.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b40-6\">\u201cDevelopment of rental units for senior citizens and the handicapped exclusively shall be exempt from this ordinance.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b40-7\">The first of the intervenor association\u2019s appellate contentions, follows: \u201cGovernment Code \u00a7 65008, as applied to the City of Alameda, is in violation of article XI, \u00a7 5, subd. (a) of the California Constitution.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b40-8\">Article XI, section 5, subdivision (a) of the Constitution states: \u201cIt shall be competent in any city charter to provide that the city governed thereunder may make and enforce all ordinances and regulations in respect to municipal affairs, subject only to restrictions and limitations provided in their several charters and in respect to other matters they shall be subject to general laws. City charters adopted pursuant to this Constitution shall supersede any existing charter, and with respect to municipal affairs shall supersede all laws inconsistent therewith. ...\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b40-9\">It will be noted that such autonomous legislative power as is thereby vested in the state\u2019s charter cities, relates <em>only to \u201cmunicipal </em>affairsand that \u201cin respect to other matters [i.e., those of statewide concern] they shall be subject to <em>general laws. </em>\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b40-10\">Measure I, it will be observed, restricts development of low cost, low rental, \u201cgovernment subsidized\u201d housing units.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-11\">Government Code section 65008, as here relevant, states: \u201cNo city . . . shall, in the enactment or administration of ordinances pursuant to this title, prohibit or discriminate against a residential development because such de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>velopment is intended for occupancy by persons and families of low and moderate income. ...\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b41-5\">It is patent that the City of Alameda\u2019s ordinance, and the state\u2019s statute, are in deep conflict.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-6\">The apposite rule will be found in <em>Baggett </em>v. <em>Gates </em>(1982) 32 Cal.3d 128, 135-136 [185 Cal.Rptr. 232, 649 P.2d 874]: \u201cThe general home rule provision of the Constitution gives chartered cities the power to \u2018make and enforce all ordinances and regulations in respect to municipal affairs, subject only to [the] restrictions and limitations provided in their several charters. . . .\u2019 (Cal. Const., art. XI, \u00a7 5, subd. (a).) Further, charter rovisions, ordinances or regulations \u2018relating to matters which are purely \u201cmunicipal affairs\u201d \u2019 prevail over state laws covering the same subject. . . . <em>\u2018As to matters which are of statewide concern, however, home rule charter cities remain subject to and controlled by applicable general state laws regardless of the provisions of their charters </em>[our italics]. Accordingly, the applicability of the Bill of Rights Act to charter cities turns on whether the matters it addresses are of statewide concern or are \u2018strictly\u2019 a municipal affair.\u201d (And see authority there collected.)</p>\n<p id=\"b41-9\">The issue then is whether Government Code section 65008, a general law, legislates upon <em>a matter of statewide interest and concern.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b41-10\">It has recently been judicially observed that \u201cchanges, urbanization and population growth have wrought an enormous transformation in the contemporary housing market, creating a scarcity of adequate low cost housing in virtually every urban setting.\u201d <em>(Green </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1974) 10 Cal.3d 616, 625 [111 Cal.Rptr. 704, 517 P.2d 1168].)</p>\n<p id=\"b41-11\">And the Legislature has often spoken on the subject: \u201c[T]here continues to exist throughout the state a seriously inadequate supply of safe and sanitary dwelling accommodations for persons and families of low income. This condition is contrary to the public interest. ...\u201d (Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7 33250.) And: \u201c[T]he early attainment of decent housing and a suitable living environment for every California family is a priority of the highest order\u201d; and that, \u201c[t]he provision of housing affordable to low and moderate income households requires the cooperation of all levels of government.\u201d (Gov. Code, \u00a7 65580.)</p>\n<p id=\"b41-12\">And: \u201cAlthough what constitutes a matter of statewide concern is ultimately an issue for the courts to decide, it is well settled that this court will accord \u2018great weight\u2019 to the Legislature\u2019s evaluation of this question. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number><em>(Bishop </em>v. <em>City of San Jose </em>[1969] 1 Cal.3d at p. 63 [81 Cal.Rptr. 465, 460 P.2d 137].)\u201d <em>(Baggett v. Gates, supra, </em>32 Cal.3d 128, 136.)</p>\n<p id=\"b42-4\">These high pronouncements do no more than iterate what is the common knowledge of all. (See Evid. Code, \u00a7 452, subd. (h).)</p>\n<p id=\"b42-5\">We hold, as was concluded by the superior court, that locally unrestricted development of low cost housing is a matter of vital state concern. No merit is discerned in the instant contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-6\">The next of the intervener association\u2019s appellate contentions is that: \u201cMeasure I does not conflict with Government Code \u00a7 65008.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b42-7\">For the reasons stated above we have concluded otherwise, and find the contention invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-8\">The remaining appellate contention is stated as follows: \u201cThe state has not \u2018preempted\u2019 the field of mandatory referenda for low income housing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b42-9\">In the determination of such an issue: \u201cThe task is ... to determine whether the state has occupied a relevant field\u2014an area of legislation which includes the subject of the local legislation, and is sufficiently logically related so that a court, or a local legislative body, can detect a patterned approach to the subject.\u201d <em>(Galvan </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1969) 70 Cal.2d 851, 862 [76 Cal.Rptr. 642, 452 P.2d 930].)  Applying this authority we must, and do, hold that Government Code section 65008 has preempted the field purported to be covered by Measure I.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-10\">We think it proper to note that the intervener association places no reliance upon the state\u2019s Constitution, article XXXIV, section 1. (Cf. <em>California Housing Finance Agency </em>v. <em>Patitucci </em>(1978) 22 Cal.3d 171 [148 Cal.Rptr. 875, 583 P.2d 729], <em>passim.) </em>That constitutional provision permits the development, construction, or acquisition of \u201clow rent housing projects\u201d by a <em>\u201ccity, town </em>or county\u201d <em>only </em>on approval of a majority of its voters; Measure I, with which we are here concerned, thus relates only to <em>privately </em>owned and developed <em>government subsidized </em>rental housing units. And it is found unnecessary to pass upon plaintiffs\u2019 argument that Measure I violates the \u201cequal protection\u201d clauses of the state and federal Constitutions.  Reviewing courts will not reach constitutional questions unless absolutely required to do so in order to dispose of matters before them. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Green </em>(1980) 27 Cal.3d 1, 50 [164 Cal.Rptr. 1, 609 P.2d 468]; <em>Bayside Timber Co. </em>v. <em>Board of Supervisors </em>(1971) 20 Cal.App.3d 1, 5-6 [97 Cal.Rptr. 431].)</p>\n<p id=\"b43-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>The summary judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-5\">Racanelli, P. J., and Holmdahl, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
