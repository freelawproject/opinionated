We hold the rule is applicable in such a case.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> As an independent ground for reversal, we agree with the decision in <em>People </em>v. <em>Jacobs </em>(1984) 158 Cal.App.3d 740 [204 Cal.Rptr. 849] that impeaching the defendant with his postarrest, post <em>-Miranda </em>warning silence violates his privilege against self-incrimination under article I, section 15 of the California Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-5\">Other contentions of the defendant are discussed in the unreported portion of this opinion because their resolution does not meet the standards for publication of rule 976 of the California Rules of Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-6\">Facts and Proceedings Below</p>\n<p id=\"b608-7\">Defendant was convicted by a jury of one count of robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-8\">The victim, Ms. Zumba, was shopping in a Los Angeles supermarket when she was approached by two men, one Latin, one black. The black man demanded the money Ms. Zumba was carrying in her hand. She refused. The man put his hand under his sweater as if he were carrying a weapon. He then grabbed the money out of Ms. Zumba\u2019s hand and left the store.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-9\">Ms. Zumba reported the robbery to store employees including Mr. Johnson, an off-duty police officer who was working as a security officer for the market. Johnson remembered that at about the time of the robbery he had seen a black man in the market who fit the description Ms. Zumba gave. Johnson\u2019s attention focused on this man because he and a Latin man were walking through the store together seeming to put items at random into their shopping cart.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"797\">*797</page-number>Two days later Johnson was again working at the market with a partner, Kenneth Bailey. Bailey observed two men, a black and a Latin, walking through the store together appearing to be picking items at random and putting them in a shopping cart. The men matched the description of the men involved in the Zumba robbery in appearance and behavior.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-5\">Bailey alerted Johnson who went outside the store and watched for the men to leave. Defendant, the black man, exited the store. To Johnson, the defendant appeared to be the man he had observed the day Ms. Zumba was robbed and appeared to match the description of the robber given by Ms. Zumba. Johnson walked up to the defendant and identified himself as a store security officer. He asked defendant to accompany him back into the store in connection with a robbery that had occurred two days before. Defendant agreed to go with Johnson. Johnson took defendant to an upstairs office. Johnson testified at that time defendant was in custody and he was handcuffed before or just after he was taken upstairs.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-6\">While Johnson waited with the defendant, Bailey brought Ms. Zumba to the store.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-7\">Johnson took the defendant, apparently still handcuffed, downstairs to the market while Bailey took Ms. Zumba by a different route upstairs to the office. From there Ms. Zumba could observe people in the market through a one-way glass. Johnson stood with the defendant in one of the aisles. There were nine or ten other people in that aisle including three other black males. Ms. Zumba identified defendant as the man who had robbed her.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-8\">Defendant was brought back upstairs and placed under arrest. Bailey read defendant his <em>\u201cMiranda </em>rights.\u201d Defendant was specifically told, \u201cYou have the right to remain silent. Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law.\u201d Defendant said nothing and apparently remained silent up to the point city police arrived and took defendant into custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-9\">Defendant testified at his trial. He admitted having been in the market at about the time Ms. Zumba was robbed but denied robbing her. He also admitted he had talked with a Latin man in the market shortly before his arrest. According to defendant, the man approached him and offered to sell him $15 worth of food stamps for $10. Defendant gave the man $10 but did not receive the food stamps. Instead, the man told defendant he would meet him at the check-out line with the stamps. When defendant arrived at the check-out area the Latin man was not in sight. Defendant went outside to look for the man and that is when Johnson approached him.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"798\">*798</page-number>Over defense objections, the prosecutor was allowed to bring out the fact defendant had remained silent after receiving the <em>Miranda </em>warning. In particular, it was established defendant did not tell the security guards about the alleged theft of his $10. In closing argument, again over a defense objection, the prosecutor was allowed to argue defendant\u2019s silence regarding the Latin man\u2019s theft of his money impeached the credibility of this story.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-4\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b610-5\">1. <em>Impeaching Defendant Through His Silence After Arrest and a Miranda Warning Denied Defendant Due Process of Law Under the Fourteenth Amendment.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b610-6\">If Officers Bailey and Johnson had been on-duty police officers instead of private security guards, impeachment of defendant through his silence would clearly have been impermissible. In <em>Doyle </em>v. <em>Ohio, supra, </em>the Supreme Court held the prosecution\u2019s use of the defendant\u2019s postarrest, <em>post-Miranda </em>warning silence to impeach the credibility of the defendant\u2019s exculpatory testimony violated the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-7\">We do not read <em>Doyle </em>as requiring the defendant\u2019s silence be government-induced; only that it may have been Miranda-induced. Nothing in the <em>Doyle </em>opinion itself indicates an intent to limit the rule prohibiting impeachment to cases where a government agency was the source of the <em>Miranda </em>warning. The court, in <em>Doyle, </em>focused its analysis on the content of the warning, not on who gave it.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-8\">\u201cSilence in the wake of these warnings may be nothing more than the arrestee\u2019s exercise of these <em>Miranda </em>rights. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b610-9\">\u201cMoreover, while it is true that the <em>Miranda </em>warnings contain no express assurance that silence will carry no penalty, such assurance is implicit to any person who receives the warnings. In such circumstances, it would be fundamentally unfair and a deprivation of due process to allow the arrested person\u2019s silence to be used to impeach an explanation subsequently offered at trial.\u201d (426 U.S. at pp. 617-618 [49 L.Ed.2d at pp. 97-98]; citation and fh. omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b610-10\">The court also quoted from Justice White\u2019s concurrence in <em>United States </em>v. <em>Hale </em>(1975) 422 U.S. 171, 182-183 [45 L.Ed.2d 99, 108, 95 S.Ct. 2133]: \u201c \u2018[W]hen a person under arrest is informed, as <em>Miranda </em>requires, that he may remain silent, that anything he says may be used against him, and that he may have an attorney if he wishes, it seems to me that it does <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"799\">*799</page-number>not comport with due process to permit the prosecution during the trial to call attention to his silence at the time of arrest and to insist that because he did not speak about the facts of the case at that time, as he was told he need not do, an unfavorable inference might be drawn as to the truth of his trial testimony. . . . Surely Hale was not informed here that his silence, as well as his words, could be used against him at trial. Indeed, anyone would reasonably conclude from <em>Miranda </em>warnings that this would not be the case.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 619 [49 L.Ed.2d at p. 98].</p>\n<p id=\"b611-5\">Our conclusion that the focus must be on the assurances and not the as-surer is supported by the Supreme Court\u2019s subsequent decision in <em>Fletcher </em>v. <em>Weir </em>(1982) 455 U.S. 603 [71 L.Ed.2d 490, 102 S.Ct. 1309] holding the record must reflect the defendant actually received a <em>Miranda </em>warning in order to preclude impeachment based on postarrest silence. The court explained <em>Doyle </em>as follows: \u201cWhile recognizing the importance of cross-examination and of exposing fabricated defenses, we held in <em>Doyle </em>v. <em>Ohio </em>. . . that <em>because of the nature of Miranda warnings </em>it would be a violation of due process to allow comment on the silence which the warnings may well have encouraged. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b611-6\">\u201cThe significant difference between the present case and <em>Doyle </em>is that the record does not indicate that respondent . . . received <em>any Miranda </em>warnings during the period in which he remained silent immediately after his arrest.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 605 [71 L.Ed.2d at p. 493]; italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b611-7\">It is true the Supreme Court in describing <em>Doyle </em>has referred to \u201cgovernment action\u201d and \u201cgovernmental assurances\u201d inducing the defendant\u2019s silence. (See <em>Jenkins </em>v. <em>Anderson </em>(1980) 447 U.S. 231, 240 [65 L.Ed.2d 86, 95, 100 S.Ct. 2124]; <em>Fletcher </em>v. <em>Weir, supra, </em>455 U.S. at p. 606 [71 L.Ed.2d at p. 493].) Those references are merely a description of what happened in <em>Doyle. </em>They provide no basis for an interpretation limiting <em>Doyle </em>to situations where on-duty police officers give the arrestee the <em>Miranda </em>warning. That <em>Doyle </em>is not limited to warnings by police officers is apparent from the Court\u2019s citation of <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>United States </em>(1943) 318 U.S. 189 [87 L.Ed. 704, 63 S.Ct. 549] as an analogous case. (426 U.S. at p. 618, fn. 9 [49 L.Ed.2d at p. 98].) In <em>Johnson, </em>the Court held the trial judge was not required to allow the defendant who testified at his trial to invoke the privilege against self-incrimination but, once the judge advised the defendant he could assert the privilege, and defendant asserted it, elementary fairness precluded the prosecutor from commenting to the jury on defendant\u2019s invocation of the privilege. (318 U.S. at pp. 192, 197 [87 L.Ed. at pp. 709, 711].) While <em>Johnson </em>can be viewed as a case of government-induced silence, it stands for the propositions a defendant cannot be impeached on his silence after being advised of the right to remain silent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"800\">*800</page-number>whether or not such advice was required to be given and whether or not the advisor is a policeman.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-4\">If we were to hold <em>Doyle </em>is not restricted to police officers but is limited to <em>Miranda </em>warnings given by government employees, hair-splitting would result which would have nothing to do with the fundamental fairness that is supposed to attach to court proceedings. As a result, \u201cthe decision as to when basic constitutional principles apply will turn on who is paying the officer\u2019s salary at the time he [advises] the arrestee.\u201d <em>(In re Deborah </em>C., <em>supra, </em>30 Cal.3d at p. 141, [Bird, C. J., cone.].) Or, if a private security guard and a police officer are both present at an arrest, the arrestee\u2019s rights would turn on which of them reads the <em>Miranda </em>warnings. Moreover, we would be inviting private security personnel to engage in a game of entrapment in which they would read the arrestee the <em>Miranda </em>rights for the very purpose of inducing his or her silence in order to enable the prosecutor to use this silence against the defendant at trial. (Cf. <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>United States, supra, </em>318 U.S. at p. 197 [87 L.Ed. at p. 711].)</p>\n<p id=\"b612-5\">2. <em>Impeaching Defendant on the Basis of His Postarrest, Post-Miranda Silence Violated His Privilege Against Self Incrimination Under Article I, Section 15 of the California Constitution and Evidence Code Section 940.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b612-6\">As a separate, independent ground for reversal, we hold the use of defendant\u2019s silence for purposes of impeaching his trial testimony violated his privilege against self-incrimination guaranteed by article I, section 15 of our state Constitution and incorporated into section 940 of the Evidence Code.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b612-7\">In <em>People </em>v. <em>Jacobs </em>(1984) 158 Cal.App.3d 740 [204 Cal.Rptr. 849] it was held questioning defendant on cross-examination about his silence occurring both during and after his arrest violated the defendant\u2019s privilege against self-incrimination under article I, section 15. (158 Cal.App.3d at p. 750.)  We believe that decision is supported, if not compelled, by our Supreme Court\u2019s opinions in <em>People </em>v. <em>Cockrell </em>(1965) 63 Cal.2d 659 [47 Cal.Rptr. 788, 408 P.2d 116] and <em>People </em>v. <em>Disbrow </em>(1976) 16 Cal.3d 101 [127 Cal.Rptr. 360, 545 P.2d 272],<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b613-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"801\">*801</page-number>3. <em>The Error in Allowing the Impeachment Testimony Was Prejudicial.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b613-5\">At the oral argument of this appeal the People conceded <em>Doyle </em>applied to this case and rendered inadmissible appellant\u2019s silence <em>ajier </em>the security guard gave the <em>Miranda </em>warning. However, the People then argued the prosecutor was entitled to comment on defendant\u2019s <em>prearrest </em>silence. Therefore, there was no prejudice because defendant was silent both before and after his arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-6\">We agree prearrest silence can be used to impeach the defendant\u2019s trial testimony unless the court finds the silence was an invocation of Fifth Amendment rights. <em>(Jenkins </em>v. <em>Anderson, supra, </em>447 U.S. 231; <em>People </em>v. <em>Free </em>(1982) 131 Cal.App.3d 155 [182 Cal.Rptr. 259]; and see <em>People </em>v. <em>Preston </em>(1973) 9 Cal.3d 308 [107 Cal.Rptr. 300, 508 P.2d 300]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Wilson </em>(1965) 238 Cal.App.2d 447 [48 Cal.Rptr. 55].) Moreover, there is no basis in the record of this case for an inference defendant\u2019s prearrest silence was intended as an invocation of his privilege against self-incrimination.  We disagree, however, with the argument defendant was not prejudiced by references to his postarrest silence.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-7\">On cross-examination defendant was asked why he did not tell Johnson or Bailey or Officer Ramirez about the Latin man stealing his $10. This question was asked in various ways at least 11 times. (See dissent, <em>post, </em>at p. 808, fns. 2 and 3.) Sometimes the question referred to his prearrest silence. Sometimes the question referred to his postarrest silence. Sometimes the time frame of the question was ambiguous. In addition, Johnson and Bailey were asked if defendant had \u201cever\u201d reported to them the alleged theft of his $10. They both responded he had not.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> More important, the prosecutor argued to the jury if the defendant was truly innocent he would have ignored the <em>Miranda </em>warning and told his side of the story to the security officers or Officer Ramirez. This is exactly the sort of argument <em>Doyle </em>was intended to prohibit. (See quotation from <em>United States </em>v. <em>Hale, supra, </em>at p. 7.)</p>\n<p id=\"b613-8\">The applicable test for prejudice in this case is whether these errors were harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>(Chapman </em>v. <em>California </em>(1967) 386 U.S. 18, 24 [17 L.Ed.2d 705, 710, 87 S.Ct. 824, 24 A.L.R.3d 1065]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Galloway </em>(1979) 100 Cal.App.3d 551, 559 [160 Cal.Rptr. 914].) Upon an examination of the entire record, it appears reasonably possible <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"802\">*802</page-number>these errors may have materially influenced the jury in arriving at its verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-4\">The evidence against defendant was not overwhelming. It was based almost entirely on Ms. Zumba\u2019s identification of defendant. This identification is suspect given the circumstances under which it occurred. Defendant was placed in an aisle of the market alongside Johnson whom Ms. Zumba knew to be a security officer employed by the market. It appears from the record defendant was handcuffed at this time. The record does not reflect how far away Ms. Zumba was from the defendant when she made her identification but it does show she was in an upstairs office looking down through a one-way mirror. She could not have been very close.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-5\">The impeachment of defendant touched a \u201clive nerve in the defense.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Galloway, supra, </em>100 Cal.App.3d at p. 561.) The testimony about defendant\u2019s silence and the prosecutor\u2019s remarks to the jury were intended to challenge the credibility of the one exculpatory defense presented by the defendant. The sole purpose was to convey the impression defendant\u2019s explanation was fabricated. (Cf. <em>Galloway, supra, </em>at p. 561; <em>Jacobs, supra, </em>158 Cal.App.3d at p. 752.)</p>\n<p id=\"b614-6\">The harmful impact of the prosecutor\u2019s conduct was not ameliorated by a curative instruction from the trial court. To the contrary, the trial court overruled defense objections to the testimony and closing argument and actively condoned the abridgment of defendant\u2019s constitutional rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-7\">4. <em>The Trial Court Erred in Prohibiting Defendant\u2019s Counsel From Comparing the Defendant\u2019s Lineup to Usual Live and Photo Lineups.</em><footnotemark><em>*</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b614-8\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b614-9\">The judgment is reversed.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"AE_\">I would affirm the judgment. I respectfully dissent from those portions of the majority opinion holding that <em>Doyle </em>v. <em>Ohio </em>(1976) 426 U.S. 610 [49 L.Ed.2d 91, 96 S.Ct. 2240] governs here, and thus the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"803\">*803</page-number>trial court committed reversible error in allowing defendant\u2019s silence to be used for impeachment; and that error was committed in prohibiting defense counsel from comparing the identification procedure with live and photo lineups ordinarily conducted by police. In all other respects I concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-5\">I agree that had Kenneth Bailey in his capacity as a police officer given the <em>Miranda (Miranda </em>v. <em>Arizona </em>(1966) 384 U.S. 436 [16 L.Ed.2d 694, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 10 A.L.R.3d 974]) warnings to defendant, <em>Doyle </em>would control. But it is undisputed that David Johnson, who detained defendant, and Bailey, who arrested him and read the <em>Miranda </em>rights, acted solely in the capacity of private security personnel for Safeway without police cooperation; thus it is my view that the use of evidence of defendant\u2019s silence for impeachment was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-6\">The evidence falls into two categories. The first relates to defendant\u2019s prearrest silence\u2014his failure to tell Johnson, a private security officer for Safeway who detained him, that he had just been the victim of a food stamp scam in Safeway. This evidence is clearly admissible. (See <em>In re Deborah C. </em>(1981) 30 Cal.3d 125, 134 [177 Cal.Rptr. 852, 635 P.2d 446].) According to defendant, the reason for his silence was that \u201ceverything happened so fast\u201d and \u201cMr. Johnson did all the talking\u201d while waiting for Mrs. Zumba. The second relates to defendant\u2019s postarrest silence\u2014his failure to tell Bailey that he had just been victimized by a Mexican male in a food stamp scam. This silence occurred after Bailey arrested him and read the <em>Miranda </em>warnings. For the following reasons, it is my conclusion that this too was admissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b615-8\">Use of Defendant\u2019s Postarrest Silence Proper</p>\n<p id=\"b615-9\">Private security personnel are not police and have only the powers and privileges of other private persons, except as provided by statute. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Zelinski </em>(1979) 24 Cal.3d 357, 365 [155 Cal.Rptr. 575, 594 P.2d 1000].) A plainclothes private security employee who acts without police cooperation is not required to follow <em>Miranda </em>procedures before eliciting incriminating statements for use against defendant. <em>(In re Deborah C., supra, </em>30 Cal.3d 125, 134.) The confession of Deborah C., given to a private security officer who arrested her for shoplifting but did not advise her of her <em>Miranda </em>rights, was admissible on the issue of her guilt. Although in <em>Deborah C., Miranda </em>warnings were not given, and in the instant case they were, the language in <em>Deborah C. </em>strongly suggests that it <em>does </em>make a difference whether the officer who detains and warns a suspect of <em>Miranda </em>rights is a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"804\">*804</page-number>government law enforcement officer or private security personnel. The court in <em>Deborah C. </em>pointed up this difference in its reference to <em>Miranda: </em>\u201cDoes <em>Miranda </em>govern custodial investigations by store detectives? That case concerned \u2018the police\u2019 and \u2018the authorities.\u2019 California courts have limited its requirements [citation], to Taw enforcement officials,\u2019 and their agents, and agents of the court, while the suspect is in official custody. [Citations.]\u201d (P. 130.) While, as asserted by the majority, nothing in <em>Doyle </em>limits the rule prohibiting impeachment to cases where silence is government induced, there is no reason under the <em>Doyle </em>facts why it should. But an analysis of <em>Doyle </em>and subsequent references to <em>Doyle </em>made by the Supreme Court put it in proper perspective. As in <em>Miranda, </em>upon which <em>Doyle </em>relies, the <em>Doyle </em>defendants were advised of their <em>Miranda </em>rights by a government officer; <em>in Doyle </em>by \u201ca narcotic agent.\u201d And the court\u2019s subsequent characterization of <em>Doyle </em>makes it clear that <em>Doyle </em>dealt solely with government action. \u201cIn <em>Jenkins [Jenkins </em>v. <em>Anderson </em>(1980) 447 U.S. 231 (65 L.Ed.2d 86, 100 S.Ct. 2124)], as in other <em>post-Doyle </em>cases, we have consistently explained <em>Doyle </em>as a case where the government had induced silence by implicitly assuring the defendant that his silence would not be used against him.\u201d <em>(Fletcher </em>v. <em>Weir </em>(1982) 455 U.S. 603, 606 [71 L.Ed.2d 490, 494, 102 S.Ct. 1309].) Finally, in <em>Deborah C. </em>the court said: \u201cFor policy reasons <em>Miranda </em>established a stricter definition of voluntariness when answers are obtained in an \u2018official interrogation\u2019 of a suspect in police custody by Taw enforcement officials\u2019 or with their complicity. [Citations.] That private security guards sometimes act under color of law when they conduct illegal searches neither makes them Taw enforcement officials\u2019 nor establishes the complicity of those officials for purposes of <em>Miranda. </em>It does not render their detention of shoplifting suspects \u2018police custody\u2019 nor their questioning \u2018official.\u2019\u201d (P. 132.)</p>\n<p id=\"b616-4\">n</p>\n<p id=\"b616-5\">Any Error Harmless Beyond Reasonable Doubt</p>\n<p id=\"b616-6\">If it can be said impeachment by use of defendant\u2019s postarrest silence<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> was error, it fails to rise to the dignity of reversible error under the most stringent rule of <em>Chapman </em>v. <em>California </em>(1967) 386 U.S. 18 [17 L.Ed.2d 705, 87 S.Ct. 824, 24 A.L.R.3d 1065]; see also <em>People </em>v. <em>Galloway </em>(1979) 100 Cal.App.3d 551, 559-562 [160 Cal.Rptr. 914]. Assessing the evidence as a whole to determine the impact of the impeaching evidence on the jury, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"805\">*805</page-number>I could not conclude from the overwhelming evidence of defendant\u2019s guilt, the defense offered and the nature of the impeaching evidence, that any error was not harmless beyond a reasonable doubt or that there is a reasonable possibility that the evidence complained of might have contributed to the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-5\">Mrs. Zumba is from El Salvador and speaks only little English. She and her sister went to a supermarket on Sunday, January 16. Mrs. Zumba held four $20 bills in her hand. As she entered she saw and heard a Latin male talking to a black male (identified as defendant), but the only thing she was able to catch was the word \u201cmoney\u201d; later she again observed them together. While Mrs. Zumba was buying chickens, the Latin male approached her and said in Spanish, \u201cListen, I\u2019m going to sell you some food stamps for 160\u201d; she refused saying she had only enough money for groceries; he then asked if she gets welfare or food stamps, and she responded in the negative. He returned to defendant, and Mrs. Zumba walked over to her sister. When she returned to the chickens, the Latin male a second time approached Mrs. Zumba about buying food stamps, and again she said \u201cNo,\u201d whereupon he walked back to defendant. The Latin male then walked about while defendant walked over to Mrs. Zumba; he told her, \u201cGive me the money,\u201d and when she said \u201cNo,\u201d he put his hand under his sweater and pointed something at her, which she \u201cthought could be a knife or a gun,\u201d and with the other hand grabbed the money from her hand; she pulled her hand away and said \u201c\u2018Give me my money,\u201d\u2019 but he left taking \u201clarge steps.\u201d Mrs. Zumba was \u201cvery frightened\u201d but did not scream or follow defendant; instead she went to her sister who scolded her. She and her sister left the store crying; employees of the store called police. In the store, defendant and the Latin male were in Mrs. Zumba\u2019s view \u201c[a]bout 20 minutes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b617-6\">At trial Mrs. Zumba positively identified defendant as the \u201cblack man\u201d who robbed her. Later she described defendant from memory without looking at him, \u201cKinky hair with an afro-like hairstyle, some black glasses, an oval shaped face, dark, he had a sleeveless brown sweater, a green shirt, brown trousers, slim, not very tall and not very short\u201d but taller than she (she is five feet). She described the Latin male as a little taller than she, brown hair, oval face, very fair, hazel eyes, brown sweater with a blue stripe across the chest, and a tattoo on the back of his hand.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-7\">David Johnson is a police officer for the City of Monterey Park but was working the shoplifting detail in civilian clothes as a private security officer on a part-time basis for Safeway on Sunday, January 16; he was on the second floor looking through a two-way mirror when he saw a Latin male and a black male going through the store and at random putting items into a cart without looking at them; he watched them for ten minutes until his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"806\">*806</page-number>attention was directed elsewhere; four or five minutes later he was advised of an incident in the store, and met Mrs. Zumba outside. She was crying and very upset, but through an interpreter described the two men who had approached her; her description conformed to that of the black male and the Latin male he had just been observing; police were called.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-4\">Mrs. Zumba described defendant to police as being taller than she, having kinky hair with an afro and an oval face, and wearing black glasses, a sleeveless brown sweater, green shirt and brown trousers.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-5\">Two days later, on January 18, Kenneth Bailey, a police officer for the Los Angeles Community College District, was working part-time with Johnson as a private security officer for Safeway; he observed a Latin male and a black male (defendant), whose descriptions conformed to those in a report of a robbery which had occurred in the store on the 16th, and made contact with Johnson; meanwhile the Latin man and defendant split up and he lost sight of the Latin male but watched defendant put items in a shopping cart at random; he and Johnson then stationed themselves outside to wait for the men to leave; they did not see the Latin male but in about three minutes defendant, who left a cart full of groceries in the produce section, exited the market. Johnson recognized defendant as conforming to the description he had received from Mrs. Zumba and also as the man he had seen in the store on January 16; they approached defendant and identified themselves as private security officers and asked him if he would step back into the store with them \u201cfor a brief conversation\u201d concerning a robbery that had been committed there two days before; defendant agreed. Johnson explained to defendant a lady was robbed inside the store on Sunday, he fit the description and he remembered seeing him in the store that Sunday. Defendant was somewhat apprehensive, and \u201cwe told him we just wanted to detain him for a while ... to conduct the investigation\u2014find out his name, his age, place of birth.\u201d Defendant said \u201cThis is defamation of character. I don\u2019t know why you are doing this to me, this is how people get sued.\u201d They all went upstairs and Bailey called Mrs. Zumba.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-6\">Asked by phone if she could identify the black male, Mrs. Zumba told Bailey \u201cThat [she] could\u201d but \u201cI don\u2019t want him to see me.\u201d He drove her to the store, and while Johnson took defendant downstairs, Bailey took Mrs. Zumba upstairs a different route; defendant was taken to an aisle where people were shopping; she looked at those people and when she saw defendant, she started to jump up and down and scream, \u201cThat\u2019s him. That\u2019s him. That\u2019s him.\u201d He wore the same sweater, the same brown cap, glasses but a different colored shirt, and he was handcuffed. After her identification, Bailey placed defendant under arrest and read to him the <em>Miranda </em>warnings.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"807\">*807</page-number>The defense was that defendant did not live near the Safeway but went there alone on Sunday, January 16, to do some shopping because he was in the area to see someone he thought was responsible for a hit-and-run on his car; he did not rob Mrs. Zumba.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-5\">Defendant further testified that on January 18, he returned to the store alone and was approached by a male Mexican who wanted cash for food stamps; he agreed to buy $15 worth for $10 which he gave to the Mexican; he was to meet him at the checkout with $15 worth of groceries, but the man was not there and he began looking for him in the store and outside where he was approached by Johnson, brought back into the store and handcuffed; he left tiie shopping cart at the check stand. He did not tell Johnson he had just been the victim of a food stamp scam in the store, nor did he tell anyone after his arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-6\">I cannot agree that evidence of defendant\u2019s postarrest silence \u201cmay have materially influenced the jury in arriving at its verdict.\u201d First, the jury had before it overwhelming evidence of defendant\u2019s guilt. Mrs. Zumba positively identified defendant at trial as the man who grabbed her money. She had more than ample opportunity to and did observe defendant and hear him speak; he was in her continuous view in the Safeway for 20 minutes\u2014 she saw him twice conversing with the Latin male, then observed the 2 talk together after each occasion the Latin male approached her, and finally defendant himself approached her and talked with her at short range demanding her money and grabbing it from her hand. Her observation of defendant was long enough and thorough enough to make her description of defendant precise enough for Johnson to identify him as the man he had just observed for 10 minutes on January 16 and to recognize him in the market two days later, and for Bailey, who had not previously seen defendant, to identify him on January 18. The majority labels Mrs. Zumba\u2019s identification in the store on January 18 as suspect because defendant was standing handcuffed near Johnson; but the fact is that when Mrs. Zumba spotted him among the shoppers in the aisle of the store she jumped up and down screaming \u201cThat\u2019s him. That\u2019s him. That\u2019s him.\u201d Her spontaneous conduct demonstrated an emotional reaction upon seeing the man who took her money that was strong evidence of the credibility of her identification.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-7\">While Mrs. Zumba\u2019s testimony alone was more than sufficient to establish defendant as the robber, her testimony, in large part, was corroborated by Johnson, indeed, by defendant himself. Defendant admitted being in Safeway on January 16; further, just before Johnson talked to Mrs. Zumba on January 16, he watched defendant for 10 minutes with a Latin male fill a cart at random, an obvious ruse to appear to be a bona fide shopper while on the lookout for victims.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"808\">*808</page-number>Second, the defense to the robbery was brief and to the point\u2014defendant was in Safeway on Sunday but did not rob Mrs. Zumba. Defendant\u2019s testimony then developed a food stamp scam in which he claimed a Mexican male victimized him in the Safeway on January 18 just prior to his detention by Johnson. That he was victimized of $10 in the market may explain what he was doing in Safeway on January 18, but does little or nothing for his defense that he did not rob Mrs. Zumba on January 16. While evidence of defendant\u2019s silence concerning this purported theft went to his credibility\u2014 whether his testimony concerning the food stamp scam by a Mexican male was a recent fabrication\u2014it did not directly impeach his defense to the crime of robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-4\">Third, the bulk of the impeaching questions related to defendant\u2019s prearrest silence\u2014his failure to tell Johnson he had just been the victim of a theft\u2014and those questions were proper as were the questions of Johnson on rebuttal. Whatever impact the evidence of defendant\u2019s silence had on the jury, it occurred long before the few impeaching questions were asked of defendant concerning his silence after arrest. Contrary to the assertion of the majority that there was only one question posed to defendant regarding his prearrest silence, and there were numerous questions referring to his postarrest silence, there appear in the cross-examination of defendant at least eight<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> separate occasions on which he was asked about his <em>prearrest </em>silence to Johnson, one of which did also include Bailey, and one, Bailey and Ramirez; but I find no more than three<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> questions later directed to postarrest silence\u2014one relating to his failure to tell Bailey of the theft, and two relating to his silence to Officer Ramirez. Equally limited was the im<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"809\">*809</page-number>peaching evidence relating to postarrest silence. Three questions<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> were asked of Johnson on rebuttal relating to prearrest silence, but only one was asked of Bailey,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and <em>none </em>was asked of Ramirez. The impeaching questions of defendant relating to his prearrest silence were asked first, and consisted of the bulk of the impeaching evidence; it was then the impact was made on the jury. Thus, any subsequent queries relating to postarrest silence, of which there were only several, could have had little or no additional impact on the jurors. Further, defendant explained his postarrest silence to be the result of Bailey\u2019s <em>Miranda </em>warnings, and admonition, \u201cFrom this point don\u2019t talk to anybody pertaining to anything, no matter who it is.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b621-5\">in</p>\n<p id=\"b621-6\">Jury Argument Re Defendant\u2019s \u201cLineup\u201d<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b621-7\">I concur in the majority opinion in all other respects.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-8\">Respondent\u2019s petition for review by the Supreme Court was denied June 27, 1985.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b616-7\">There are here two categories of postarrest silence the subject of three impeaching questions\u2014defendant was asked if he told Bailey he had been the victim of a theft in the store, and was asked if he told Officer Ramirez about the theft, and if he discussed \u201cthis Latin person\u201d with him.
