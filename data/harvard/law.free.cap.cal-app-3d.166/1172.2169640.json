J.</author>\n<p id=\"AIx\">In this action to determine coverage under a liability insurance policy, plaintiff Jewell Bohannon appeals from summary judgment entered in favor of defendant Aetna Casualty and Surety Company (Aetna). Bohannon sought a declaration that Aetna was obligated to defend him in a personal injury action brought by a pedestrian who had been injured when struck by a 1965 Ford Mustang driven by Bohannon\u2019s daughter. The personal injury action sought to establish Bohannon\u2019s liability under theories of ownership, negligent entrustment and negligent maintenance of the Mustang.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-9\">The facts underlying this appeal are undisputed. When the accident occurred on November 23, 1982, Bohannon was a named insured under an automobile insurance policy issued by Aetna, but the Mustang was not described therein as a covered vehicle. On June 23, 1981, Bohannon had requested that the Mustang be deleted from the insurance coverage. Sometime prior to March 1982, he gave the vehicle to his daughter for her permanent use. Bohannon endorsed the pink slip and delivered it to his daughter on November 20, 1982, releasing his interest in the vehicle. However, at the time of the accident three days later, ownership had not been transferred on the records of the Department of Motor Vehicles (Department) and Bohannon was still the registered owner of the Mustang.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-10\">The question here is whether Bohannon \u201cowned\u201d the Mustang at the time of the accident within the meaning of an exclusionary clause in Aetna\u2019s insurance policy. As we conclude that he did, we shall affirm summary judgment in Aetna\u2019s favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1175\">*1175</page-number>The insurance policy contains an omnibus coverage clause: \u201cWe [Aetna] will pay damages for bodily injury or property damage for which any <em>covered person </em>becomes legally responsible because of an auto accident. We will settle or defend, as we consider appropriate, any claim or suit asking for these damages. . . . [f] \u2018 <em>Covered </em>person\u2019 as used in this Part means: 1. You or any <em>family member </em>for the ownership, maintenance or use of any auto or trailer.\u201d (Italics in original.) Aetna concedes that Bohannon is a \u201ccovered person\u201d within the meaning of this clause and relies upon exclusion 9 of the policy to deny coverage. Exclusion 9 provides: \u201cWe [Aetna] do not provide Liability Coverage: ... [1] 9. For the ownership, maintenance or use of any vehicle, other than <em>your covered auto, </em>which is owned by you or furnished or available for your regular use.\u201d (Italics in original.) Since \u201cyour covered auto\u201d is defined as \u201cany vehicle shown in the declarations\u201d and Bohannon had caused the Mustang to be deleted from the declarations, the exclusion operates to preclude liability coverage for the Mustang if Bohannon \u201cowned\u201d the vehicle at the time of the accident. (See <em>Giovanna </em>v. <em>Vigilant Insurance Co. </em>(1984) 156 Cal.App.3d 368, 370 [202 Cal.Rptr. 364].)</p>\n<p id=\"b935-4\">Bohannon contends, however, that the meaning of \u201cownership\u201d as used in the coverage clause differs from its meaning as used in exclusion 9. He argues that coverage clauses are to be interpreted broadly in favor of indemnity for loss, and therefore as registered owner of the Mustang on the files of the Department at the time of the accident, he must be deemed its owner and entitled to coverage within contemplation of the omnibus coverage clause; on the other hand, since exclusions are to be interpreted narrowly against the insurer, he insists that because he had at the time of the accident divested himself of possession and control of the Mustang, he was not then its owner under \u201cordinary principles of personal property law\u201d nor, accordingly, within contemplation of exclusion 9. While the general principles upon which this construct is premised are undebatable (see <em>Reserve Insurance Co. </em>v. <em>Pisciotta </em>(1982) 30 Cal.3d 800, 807-808 [180 Cal.Rptr. 628, 640 P.2d 764]), they do not require that we apply antonymous interpretations of the word \u201cownership\u201d as it appears in different provisions of the same policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-5\">\u201cOwnership\u201d has different meanings, depending on the context in which the word appears and the circumstances in which it is used. <em>(Everly </em>v. <em>Creech </em>(1956) 139 Cal.App.2d 651, 657-658 [294 P.2d 109], citing <em>Pacific Coast etc. Bank </em>v. <em>Roberts </em>(1940) 16 Cal.2d 800, 805-806 [108 P.2d 439].)  For purposes of imposing liability under the state financial responsibility laws (Veh. Code, \u00a7 17150), there may be several owners of a vehicle at any one time. In particular, both (1) the transferor of an automobile who, for failure to notify the Department of the transfer as pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1176\">*1176</page-number>scribed by Vehicle Code section 5600 et seq., remains the \u201cregistered owner\u201d (see Veh. Code, \u00a7 505) and (2) the transferee who has possession and control of the automobile are deemed to be owners as to third parties injured by the use of the automobile. <em>(Uber </em>v. <em>Ohio Casualty Ins. Co. </em>(1967) 247 Cal.App.2d 611, 615 [55 Cal.Rptr. 720]; <em>Ohio Cas. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Aetna Ins. Co. </em>(1978) 85 Cal.App.3d 521, 523 [149 Cal.Rptr. 562]; see also <em>Stoddart </em>v. <em>Peirce </em>(1959) 53 Cal.2d 105, 115 [346 P.2d 774]; <em>Universal Underwriters Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Gewirtz </em>(1971) 5 Cal.3d 246, 247 [95 Cal.Rptr. 617, 486 P.2d 145].)</p>\n<p id=\"b936-4\">Bohannon contends that, even though he was the registered owner of the Mustang and thus deemed an owner under the financial responsibility laws (and, he argues, the omnibus coverage clause), he was not its owner for purposes of exclusion 9. He asserts that the average person understands an owner to be the person in possession and control of a vehicle and, therefore, the ambiguity of the word \u201cowned\u201d as used in the exclusionary clause must be resolved in his favor and against the insurer-draftsman. The argument rests on the false assumption that only one meaning of \u201cowned\u201d is reasonably permissible under the circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b936-5\">\u201cThe word \u2018owner,\u2019 as applied to motor vehicles, is commonly understood to designate the person in whom title is vested either as legal [or equitable] owner or as registered owner.\u201d <em>(Martin </em>v. <em>State Farm Mutual Auto. Ins. Co. </em>(1962) 200 Cal.App.2d 459, 469 [19 Cal.Rptr. 364]; see also <em>Everly </em>v. <em>Creech, supra, </em>139 Cal.App.2d at p. 658.) Since well-settled law makes all such owners simultaneously liable to insured third parties (see <em>Stoddart </em>v. <em>Peirce, supra, </em>53 Cal.2d at p. 115), the courts have long interpreted the term \u201cowner\u201d as used in liability insurance policies to encompass the same meanings. <em>(Traders etc. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Pac. Emp. Ins. Co. </em>(1955) 130 Cal.App.2d 158, 164 [278 P.2d 493]; <em>Everly </em>v. <em>Creech, supra, </em>139 Cal.App.2d at p. 658; <em>Uber </em>v. <em>Ohio Casualty Ins. Co., supra, </em>247 Cal.App.2d at p. 615; <em>Allstate Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Chinn </em>(1969) 271 Cal.App.2d 274, 278-279 [76 Cal.Rptr. 264]; see also <em>Ohio Cas. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Aetna Ins. Co., supra, </em>85 Cal.App.3d at p. 523.) \u201c[A]ll applicable law enters into and is a part of every contract by inference . . . and this is no exception.\u201d <em>{Traders etc. Ins. Co., </em>at p. 164; Civ. Code, \u00a7 1656.) It would be \u201cparadoxical indeed\u201d if the registered owner is held to be an \u201cowner under the law but not under his insurance contract.\u201d (See <em>Traders etc. Ins. Co., </em>at p. 164.)</p>\n<p id=\"b936-6\">Even if we were to assume that the word \u201cowned\u201d is ambiguous under the circumstances of this case, the judicial precept that unclear language in an insurance exclusionary clause is to be construed narrowly against the insurer serves only to protect the insured\u2019s reasonable expecta<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1177\">*1177</page-number>tions of coverage. <em>(Reserve Insurance Co. </em>v. <em>Pisciotta, supra, </em>30 Cal.3d at pp. 807-808.)  Whether Bohannon\u2019s expectations under the contract are reasonable is a question of law. <em>(Wolf Machinery Co. </em>v. <em>Insurance Co. of North America </em>(1982) 133 Cal.App.3d 324, 329 [183 Cal.Rptr. 695].) Bohannon could have had no reasonable expectation that coverage of the Mustang would continue after he specifically deleted it from his insurance declaration. In fact, Bohannon admitted in his deposition that he did not consider the Mustang to be insured thereafter. Moreover, Aetna cannot be said to have assumed the risk of providing coverage for liability arising out of Bohannon\u2019s \u201cownership\u201d of the Mustang after he deleted it from the declarations as a \u201ccovered auto\u201d and to that extent effected a reduction in his premium. Under Bohannon\u2019s construction of the policy, he could purchase several automobiles, give them to family members, and enjoy the benefits of coverage without ever having to pay premiums commensurate with the increased risk of insurance exposure.  \u201c \u2018The courts will not indulge in a forced construction of an insurance policy so as to fasten a liability on the company which it has not assumed.\u2019\u201d <em>(Wolf Machinery Co., supra, </em>133 Cal.App.3d at p. 328, quoting <em>St. Paul Fire &amp; Marine Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Coss </em>(1978) 80 Cal.App.3d 888, 896 [145 Cal.Rptr. 836].)</p>\n<p id=\"b937-5\">Bohannon finally argues that, because the personal injury action against him was not only for ownership liability but also for negligent maintenance and entrustment of the Mustang, Aetna was potentially liable under the insurance policy and therefore had a duty to defend him. He suggests that the evidence presented at the motion for summary judgment did not resolve whether there could have been negligent maintenance or entrustment of the Mustang prior to June 23, 1981, when the vehicle was a \u201ccovered auto\u201d under the insurance policy. We are not impressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b937-6\">It is true that an insurer\u2019s duty to defend litigation brought against its insured is broader than its duty to indemnify; the insurer must provide a defense when it learns facts creating the potential for liability under the policy. <em>(Giddings </em>v. <em>Industrial Indemnity Co. </em>(1980) 112 Cal.App.3d 213, 217 [169 Cal.Rptr. 278], citing <em>Gray </em>v. <em>Zurich Insurance Co. </em>(1966) 65 Cal.2d 263, 275-277 [54 Cal.Rptr. 104, 419 P.2d 168].) \u201cBut the insurer\u2019s obligation is not unlimited; the duty to defend is measured by the nature and kind of risks covered by the policy [citations].\u201d <em>(Giddings, </em>at p. 218, citing inter alia <em>Gray, </em>at p. 275.)  The suggestion of potential liability arising out of the speculative possibility of Bohannon\u2019s \u201centrustment\u201d of the Mustang to his daughter prior to June 23, 1981, with respect to an accident which occurred almost one and one-half years later is frivolous as well as farfetched. (See <em>Giddings, supra, </em>at p. 220.)</p>\n<p id=\"b938-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1178\">*1178</page-number>The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b938-4\">Regan, J., and Blease, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b938-5\">Appellant\u2019s petition for review by the Supreme Court was denied May 29, 1985.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
