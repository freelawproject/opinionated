L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-5\">1. <em>Facts. </em>Based on the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence, the jury could have found the following. The defendant and the victim lived together in the victim\u2019s apartment in Brockton. They both were from Haiti,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and the defendant planned to marry the victim and remain in the United States. The victim, however, wanted to end their relationship. She informed a friend from work that she was buying a new house and was not taking the defendant with her.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-6\">During the week prior to her death, the victim and the defendant argued. On Wednesday, June 11, 2003, the defendant \u201ccaught\u201d the victim on the telephone with \u201csomebody.\u201d The defendant told a friend that he believed that the victim was \u201chaving an affair.\u201d The victim told the defendant that he needed to move out of her apartment and, if he did not, she would move and leave him there. The two argued throughout the day, and the victim threw a key or keys at the defendant. The defendant told a friend that the victim was \u201cnot going to do this to [him] anymore.\u201d He quietly said to the victim, \u201cYou\u2019re going to stop doing that, you\u2019re not going to do that anymore.\u201d The defendant stayed at the victim\u2019s apartment for the rest of the week; the victim stayed at a friend\u2019s house.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-7\">On Saturday morning, June 14, the defendant went to see the victim at her friend\u2019s home. The victim told him that she was not going to marry him. The defendant replied, \u201cYou\u2019re never going to have someone else again, you\u2019re not going to have another husband.\u201d After the victim left, the defendant told the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>victim\u2019s friend that he (referring to himself) was going to need her prayers.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-4\">The victim stayed with her friend on Saturday night. She left for work on Sunday, June 15, at about 2:30 p.m.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The victim telephoned her friend around 11 p.m., as she was getting out of work, and asked whether the defendant was there. Learning that he was, the victim said she would not return and would not be giving the defendant a ride anywhere.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> A friend of both the victim and the defendant, Pierre Daniel Pierre St. Laurent, gave the defendant a ride back to the victim\u2019s apartment. When he dropped off the defendant, the victim\u2019s automobile was not in the driveway.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-5\">Sometime after 11 p.m. the victim stopped by a coworker\u2019s house. She stated that she was on her way home and announced that she was leaving the defendant.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Around this time, the defendant telephoned the victim\u2019s friend to see where the victim was. When the victim\u2019s friend\u2019s daughter relayed that the victim was on her way home, the defendant accused her of lying. Thereafter, the victim telephoned her friend\u2019s house, stated that she was home, and said something about packing. She indicated that the defendant was there sleeping. She said that she was going to take a few things and leave.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-6\">The next morning, Monday, June 16, at 6:30 a.m., the defendant telephoned the victim\u2019s friend and asked about the whereabouts of the victim. He told the victim\u2019s friend, \u201cIf she didn\u2019t sleep at your house last night, she\u2019s dead.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b498-7\">Sometime in the early morning of June 16, the defendant went to St. Laurent\u2019s house looking for his cellular telephone. St. Laurent suggested that the defendant should get some sleep and put him in a bedroom. He awakened the defendant at 11:30 a.m. and drove the defendant back to the victim\u2019s apartment because the defendant stated he had laundry to do. The defendant informed St. Laurent that the victim had not come home the previous night.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>After doing some personal errands, St. Laurent returned to the victim\u2019s apartment. He made himself a sandwich while the defendant was in the bathroom for about forty-five minutes. A scent of a cleaning agent permeated the air. St. Laurent took the defendant to a nearby laundry facility to pick up blankets. Thereafter, at 5 p.m., he took the defendant to the house of one of the victim\u2019s coworkers, where the defendant was doing some work. Inside, the defendant told the victim\u2019s coworker that he had not seen the victim. He expressed his opinion that the victim would have been a \u201cgood preacher,\u201d but \u201cshe [had] mined her life.\u201d The defendant left about twenty minutes later.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-4\">Once outside, he asked St. Laurent to take him to the hospital where the victim worked. When they were two blocks away, they encountered a road block and turned around. The men went to a house in Brockton to do some work. While there, St. Laurent suggested that the defendant take a \u201cbreak\u201d from the victim. The defendant replied, \u201cI don\u2019t have to worry about that no more because the [victim] thing is over.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b499-5\">This same day, at 4:20 p.m., police found the victim\u2019s body inside her automobile which had been parked oddly on the side of a road near the hospital where she worked. The police officer who discovered the victim observed multiple wounds to her hands, head, and neck. The officer attempted to check for a pulse, but the victim\u2019s body was stiff to the touch.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-6\">The victim\u2019s automobile had been seen earlier at that location, at approximately 4:10 a.m. At about 5 a.m., a woman delivering newspapers had seen a man, whom she later identified as the defendant, walking southbound on that street.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-7\">Police quickly ascertained the victim\u2019s identity by determining who owned the automobile in which she was found and by asking a supervisor at the hospital to identify her body (the victim had been wearing \u201cscrub[s]\u201d and a visit to the hospital confirmed that she was an employee). They also immediately suspected, by the absence of a significant amount of blood inside the automobile, that the victim had been killed elsewhere. Shortly thereafter, four law enforcement officers went to a house in Brockton looking for the defendant. They found him there, as well as St. Laurent.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-8\">Through St. Laurent, a State trooper asked both St. Laurent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>and the defendant to go to the Brockton police station because they had learned that the defendant\u2019s girl friend was \u201cmissing\u201d and they had some questions. The men agreed.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-5\">At the station, the men were separated. The defendant was not restrained and waited in a training room for a translator who spoke fluent Haitian-Creole to arrive. The interview of the defendant, through the translator, was not recorded.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The evidence at trial concerning the procedures followed during the interview was substantially similar to that established at the hearing on the motion to suppress and does not bear repeating (a discussion concerning the defendant\u2019s suppression motion follows). After first stating that the victim had never come home after work on Saturday night and denying having been near the hospital where the victim worked on Sunday night or Monday morning, the defendant eventually relayed that he had been merely defending himself against the victim. The defendant stated that, after working, the victim returned to her apartment and was upset that he was there. She attacked him with a knife and ended up stabbing herself while he \u201cprotected himself from the knife.\u201d The defendant then drove the victim to the hospital where she worked,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> but became afraid so he pulled over to the side of the road and left her there. The defendant stated that the victim had not died in the apartment. He also stated that he had discarded his clothing at a garbage container near the victim\u2019s apartment.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b500-6\">The police investigation of the victim\u2019s apartment showed no signs of forced entry. The mattress in the victim\u2019s bedroom had been turned over and was soaked with blood. Blood spatter was found on the headboard of the bed and on a wall in the room. Chemical analysis revealed the presence of additional blood on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>the bedroom wall. Cleaning agents, as well as wet clothes, were discovered in the bathroom. A bloodstain was on the handle to the refrigerator. Two knives were recovered: one that was wet in the sink and the other in the trash.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The knife recovered from the sink tested negative for the presence of blood; the other knife tested positive for the presence of blood. Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) testing revealed blood consistent with that of the victim and the defendant under the fingernails of the victim\u2019s right hand, and blood consistent with that of the defendant and an unknown person on the right forearm of the victim. Otherwise, the testing results did not inculpate the defendant.* <footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b501-5\">There were no tears or cuts to the outer garments worn by the victim. The victim\u2019s undergarments tested positive for the presence of blood and were inside out, and there was a tear along the seam of one of the undergarments.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-6\">The victim died as a result of multiple stab wounds. She had approximately seventy stab wounds on her body, concentrated at her head, neck, chest, abdomen, and upper extremities. There was evidence of defensive wounds and there were bite marks on her left arm. The medical examiner testified that none of her injuries would have rendered her immediately unconscious.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-7\">2. <em>Motion to suppress. </em>Prior to trial, the defendant moved to suppress statements he made to police on June 16, 2003, when he and St. Laurent agreed to speak with police at the Brockton <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>police department. The defendant claimed that his statements were made in violation of <em>Miranda </em>v. <em>Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436 (1966), and were not made freely and voluntarily under the totality of the circumstances. He asserted that: (1) his inability to speak the English language impaired his ability to resist talking to police; (2) his refusal to sign the Miranda waiver form precludes a finding that he thereafter waived those enumerated rights; (3) the discussion was completely involuntary and he made statements without the comprehension of the possible consequences; and (4) any notion of ending the questioning was eroded as the interview lengthened. Following an evidentiary hearing, a judge who was not the trial judge denied the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-5\">We summarize the judge\u2019s findings of fact, supplemented with uncontested testimony adduced at the evidentiary hearing. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Garcia, </em>443 Mass. 824, 828 (2005). After police located the defendant, he and St. Laurent agreed to go to the Brockton police station to speak with them. The defendant was not handcuffed or otherwise restrained. On arrival, the defendant was escorted to a large conference room on the second floor and was seated at a large table. The defendant did not slur his speech, did not have difficulty walking, and did not exhibit any signs of being impaired by alcohol or drugs. The ensuing interview was not recorded.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-6\">Police officers had asked a woman who worked at the Brock-ton police department as a 911 dispatcher to translate for them and the defendant during the interview. The translator spoke fluent Haitian-Creole and had previously translated for the officers when needed. In addition to the translator, State Trooper Brian Brooks, Braintree police Lieutenant Russell Jenkins, and Brockton police Detective Dominic Persampieri were present during the interview. Trooper Brooks led the interview, asking questions in a calm, composed manner.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-7\">Trooper Brooks produced a preprinted Miranda waiver form and asked the translator to interpret word for word its content to the defendant. After the translator did so,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> the defendant asked, \u201cWhy all this?\u201d and \u201cWhy should I sign this?\u201d He added, \u201cI <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>have nothing to hide.\u201d The defendant indicated that he did not want to sign the form. After noting that the defendant refused to sign the form, Trooper Brooks and Detective Jenkins signed the form, recording the time as 8:40 p.m.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-4\">Although the defendant did not sign the waiver form, he agreed to speak with the officers and did not ask to leave or request the assistance of an attorney. He appeared calm and continued with the conversation through the use of the translator.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-5\">Through the translator, Trooper Brooks asked the defendant to recount his activities during the previous Saturday and Sunday. After about forty minutes into the interview, a break was taken, whereupon the officers left the room to learn additional information about the ongoing investigation. During this and a later break, the defendant was provided with water and food.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-6\">During the interview, Trooper Brooks eventually informed the defendant that the victim was dead. The defendant showed no reaction and asked no questions about the circumstances of her death. He admitted that he and the victim had argued earlier in the week and that the victim may have been dating someone else.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-7\">Through the translator, the defendant was presented with various forms that were read to him whereby he consented to a search of the victim\u2019s apartment and to having his hands swabbed to search for blood. The defendant voiced no objection to these forms and appeared to understand their terms. While the defendant\u2019s hands were being swabbed by the technician, the defendant stated that he had suffered a cut on his hands while working. He also indicated that, if blood were to be found on his hands, it was there because he had washed the victim\u2019s underwear, which he described as bloody due to her menstruation.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-8\">After the defendant was informed that his hands had tested positive for the presence of blood and that the police knew that the victim had been at her apartment in the early Monday morning hours, the defendant indicated that he believed that the police were \u201cbluffing.\u201d He added that the victim had threatened to commit suicide and blame him for it. After Trooper Brooks relayed that there was no possibility that the victim had committed suicide, the defendant asked what Trooper Brooks could do for him. Trooper Brooks indicated that he could make no promises, that he was not the district attorney, and that the only <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>thing the defendant could do to help himself was to tell the truth. The defendant stated that the victim had attacked him with a knife, and that he had defended himself. He provided other incriminating information. At about 2 a.m., the defendant was placed under arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-5\">The judge found that the translator had \u201cproperly and completely advised\u201d the defendant of his Miranda rights in Haitian-Creole, and that the defendant did, in fact, understand them. The defendant\u2019s reluctance to sign the preprinted Miranda waiver form demonstrated his understanding of the rights described therein and \u201chis lucid consideration of his options.\u201d The judge rejected the defendant\u2019s arguments that a language barrier adversely affected his ability to understand the Miranda warnings, and that his refusal to sign the Miranda form precluded a finding of a valid waiver of Miranda rights. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Ortiz, 435 Mass. 569, 577 (2002) (absence of written waiver of Miranda rights does not vitiate oral waiver). The judge concluded that the Commonwealth satisfied its burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt both the knowing, willing, and intelligent waiver of Miranda rights by the defendant, and the voluntariness of his statements. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Day, </em>387 Mass. 915, 921 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b504-6\">In reviewing a decision on a motion to suppress, \u201cwe accept the judge\u2019s subsidiary findings of fact absent clear error \u2018but conduct an independent review of his ultimate findings and conclusions of law.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Scott, </em>440 Mass. 642, 646 (2004), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jimenez, </em>438 Mass. 213, 218 (2002). The defendant argues on appeal that, because there was no recording of his interview with police and the translator, there is no reliable evidence of the linguistic adequacy of the translated Miranda warnings and no verification of what the defendant said in response to the translator to verify that he understood the warnings. Consequently, he argues, the motion judge improperly denied his motion to suppress and incorrectly concluded that the Commonwealth satisfied its burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that he made a knowing, willing, and intelligent waiver of his Miranda rights, and that his statements were otherwise voluntarily made. Because the defendant did not raise this claim below, we ordinarily would not consider <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>it. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pares-Ramirez, </em>400 Mass. 604, 609 (1987), and cases cited. Pursuant to our review under G. L. C. 278, \u00a7 33E, however, we conclude that no substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice arose from the absence of a recording of the interview.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-5\">The record belies the defendant\u2019s claim that, in the absence of a recording of the interview, the linguistic adequacy of the translated Miranda warnings is unreliable.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The record establishes that the translator was bom in Haiti, grew up speaking Haitian-Creole, continued speaking it with her family, and was fluent in it. There is no evidence that anything particular about the Haitian culture or language would have made it difficult for the defendant to understand the translator. The record established, without contradiction, that the translator had provided translation services for the Brockton police department on prior occasions. Based on the record before him, the judge\u2019s finding that the translator properly and completely advised the defendant of his rights in Haitian-Creole was not clearly erroneous and should not be disturbed.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-6\">The absence of a recording of the defendant\u2019s responses to the translator does not give rise to a substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice. From the judge\u2019s findings, it is clear that he credited the translator\u2019s testimony concerning what the defendant said to her and properly concluded, based on his credibility determinations, that she was able to discern what the defendant said, and that what he said reflected his understanding of the Miranda warnings. In the circumstances, we discern no reason to disturb the judge\u2019s determinations that, on the record before him, are not clearly erroneous. We conclude that no substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice arises from the absence of a recording of the interview in this case. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Colon-Cruz, </em>408 Mass. 533, 539 (1990). There was no error in denying the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress on this ground. The absence of a recording does not require the exclusion of statements, but rather is a factor for the jury to consider when they decide whether the Commonwealth proved the voluntariness of the defendant\u2019s statements. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>DiGiambat-</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number><em>tista, </em>442 Mass. 423, 447-448 (2004). Because the defendant\u2019s argument concerning the voluntariness of his statements is predicated on his argument concerning the waiver of his Miranda rights, the argument similarly fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-5\">3. <em>Ineffective assistance of trial counsel. </em>At trial a witness testified that, at about 5 a.m. on the day the victim\u2019s body was discovered by police, she was delivering newspapers and saw a man, whom she later identified as the defendant, walking near the location where the victim was found. Because the witness found it unusual to \u201csee somebody on that road\u201d at that time, she mentioned the sighting to her husband when she returned from her route. Two days later, the witness\u2019s husband asked whether she had seen the newspaper.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The witness had not, but took a look and recognized a photograph of the defendant on the front page as the man she had seen previously.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> She immediately remarked to her husband, \u201cOh my God, that\u2019s the man that I saw.\u201d She contacted police.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark>-<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> During the witness\u2019s cross-examination, defense counsel elicited testimony concerning the short span of time in which she actually had observed the defendant and the fact that she had made her observations before dawn. When asked whether she had observed a caption over the story, the witness stated, \u201cI don\u2019t remember seeing any words on \u2014 I\u2019m sure there was a caption, but don\u2019t remember ever reading it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b506-6\">Following his conviction, the defendant, through new counsel, moved for a new trial under the Federal and State Constitutions on the ground that his trial counsel provided ineffective assistance by failing to file a pretrial motion to suppress the witness\u2019s identification of the defendant.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> The defendant asserted that, although not attributable to the Commonwealth, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>witness\u2019s identification of him was a \u201chighly suggestive confrontation\u201d because the photograph was \u201coutrageously suggestive.\u201d The trial judge noted that the witness\u2019s exposure to the defendant\u2019s photograph in the newspaper was not \u201ca result of any conduct on the part of the police or the Commonwealth\u201d and concluded that it \u201cwas not a sufficient ground to suppress [the] identification.\u201d The judge added that defense counsel\u2019s cross-examination of the witness at trial \u201cwas more than sufficient to explore the reliability of [her] identification.\u201d For these reasons, the judge denied the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-5\">When a defendant claims ineffective assistance of counsel for failure to move to suppress, he must \u201cdemonstrate a likelihood that the motion to suppress would have been successful.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Walker, </em>460 Mass. 590, 599 (2011), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Comita, </em>441 Mass. 86, 91 (2004). \u201cUnder art. 12 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights, an out-of-court eyewitness identification is not admissible where the defendant proves by a preponderance of the evidence, considering the totality of the circumstances, that the identification is so unnecessarily suggestive and conducive to irreparable misidentifi-cation that its admission would deprive the defendant of his right to due process.\u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Walker, supra, </em>and cases cited. \u201cIf police have not in any way manipulated press reports, then simple exposure to the media is not sufficient ground to suppress an identification [on constitutional grounds].\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Horton, </em>434 Mass. 823, 835 (2001), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Colon-Cruz, </em>408 Mass. 533, 542 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b507-6\">The defendant claims that the judge erred in analyzing his motion for a new trial by failing to consider the exclusion of the identification evidence based on common-law principles set forth in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>423 Mass. 99 (1996). In that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>case, we recognized that common-law principles of fairness dictate that an unreliable identification arising from \u201cespecially suggestive circumstances\u201d should not be admitted in evidence even where the police were not responsible for the suggestive confrontation. <em>Id. </em>at 108-109. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Odware, </em>429 Mass. 231, 236 (1999) (\u201cin some circumstances an identification that has been tainted, but not by the government, may become so unreliable that its introduction into evidence is unfair\u201d). However, in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jones, supra, </em>the witness\u2019s original brief encounter with the defendant took place a few months prior to the \u201chighly suggestive\u201d encounters with the defendant, who then was in custody in a court room. <em>Id. </em>at 101-102, 105, 110. Consequently, the judge could not find by \u201cclear and convincing evidence\u201d that the witness\u2019s in-court identification was based on her original observations of the defendant.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 105. We agreed based on the circumstances of that case. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b508-5\">Here, there was no showing that the witness\u2019s memory of her original observations of the defendant was impaired, and the so-called \u201csuggestive\u201d confrontation with the newspaper photograph occurred only two days after her original observations of the defendant. While we agree with the defendant that determinations under the common law regarding the admissibility of pretrial out-of-court identifications do not turn solely on whether government agents were involved in the identification, we find the facts of this case to be distinguishable from those in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jones, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b508-6\">The defendant contends that the witness\u2019s identification of him from the newspaper photograph was \u201chighly suggestive.\u201d In support of his argument, he relies on the text appearing in the captions above and below the photograph, as well as the accompanying story. The witness, however, was cross-examined at trial concerning this issue and testified that she did not recall seeing any of the words comprising the captions and did not recall reading any caption, or any story for that matter, before making the identification. On the record before us, there was no error in the admission of the witness\u2019s identification testimony, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>and \u201c[t]he jury were capable of making an informed assessment of the accuracy of [the witness\u2019s] identification and assessing its weight, aided by . . . cross-examination and the judge\u2019s instructions [on evaluating eyewitness identification testimony].\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Walker, supra </em>at 606-607. Because the defendant has not demonstrated a likelihood that a motion to suppress this evidence would have been successful, we conclude that the judge did not err in denying his motion for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-4\">4. <em>G.

However, we note that, because the case was tried after the <em>DiGiambattista </em>case, the judge properly instructed the jury in accordance with the <em>DiGiambattista </em>decision. See <em>id. </em>at 449 (stating no \u201cneed to postpone the implementation of our decision\").</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b500-8\">Initially, the defendant claimed that the victim was the one to drive the automobile to the hospital.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b500-9\">Police recovered the clothing and later, after giving the defendant Miranda warnings, showed him a shirt that had been recovered.

See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ortiz, </em>463 Mass. 402, 408 &amp; n.10 (2012), citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lanigan, </em>419 Mass. 15, 20 (1994) (evidence of DNA \u201cmatch\u201d is meaningless without evidence indicating significance of match). This was error. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mattei, </em>455 Mass. 840, 851-855 (2010). The defendant did not object to the admission of this testimony. Because the defendant was the victim\u2019s boy friend, the omission was of limited significance. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Linton, </em>456 Mass. 534, 559-560 (2010) (admission of nonexclusion DNA evidence without qualifying statistical evidence did not result in substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice where defendant was victim\u2019s husband). In view of this factor, the defendant\u2019s own statements to police, the medical examiner\u2019s findings concerning the nature and extent of the victim\u2019s injuries, and defense counsel\u2019s use of the DNA evidence to argue the significance of nonmatching DNA in the case, we conclude that no substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice occurred.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b502-8\">During the course of the interview, the translator was impressed that the defendant appeared to be an educated individual, did not express any confusion, and seemed to comprehend and respond appropriately to the questions posed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b505-7\">The defendant does not argue that the interview was required to be recorded at the time it took place, in 2003.

Because the standard for the admissibility of identification evidence under the Massachusetts Constitution is more favorable to a defendant than the standard under the United States Constitution, we need only review the defendant\u2019s arguments pursuant to our State standard.
