L. c. 94C, \u00a7 32L (\u00a7 32L), which decriminalizes possession of one ounce or less of marijuana, has on the provisions of G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 32C (a) (\u00a7 32C <em>[a]). </em>See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Keefner, </em>461 Mass. 507 (2012) <em>(Keefner). </em>The defendant was charged with cultivation of marijuana in violation of \u00a7 32C <em>(a) </em>and committing that violation in a school zone, G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 32J, after police found several marijuana plants that collectively weighed less than one ounce growing in a closet in his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"774\">*774</page-number>home. A judge in the District Court granted the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss, concluding that under \u00a7 32L, a person who cultivates marijuana plants that weigh one ounce or less may not be charged with cultivation in violation of \u00a7 32C <em>(\u00e1). </em>The Commonwealth appealed pursuant to G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 28E, and Mass. R. Crim. R 15 (a) (1), as appearing in 422 Mass. 1501 (1996), and we transferred the case to this court on our own motion. The Commonwealth argues that the case is controlled by this court\u2019s decision in <em>Keefner, supra, </em>and that \u00a7 32L decriminalized simple possession, but not cultivation, of one ounce or less of marijuana. We agree with the Commonwealth and reverse the order allowing the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-5\"><em>Background. </em>The undisputed facts as recounted by the motion judge are the following. On September 28, 2010, officers of the Adams police department consensually entered the defendant\u2019s residence and arrested him on active warrants. While searching for the defendant in his home, the officers observed in plain view several marijuana plants growing in a closet.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The cumulative weight of the marijuana found was less than one ounce.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-6\">A criminal complaint issued from the Northern Berkshire Division of the District Court Department charging the defendant with cultivation of marijuana and a school zone violation.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> See G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7\u00a7 32C (a), 32J. After a nonevidentiary hearing, the judge allowed the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss. The judge concluded that \u00a7 32L \u201cimpliedly included within the ambit of decriminalization the crimes of cultivating marijuana <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"775\">*775</page-number>with respect to quantities of one ounce or less.\u201d Therefore, because the defendant \u201cwas cultivating an amount of marijuana that weighed less than an ounce[,] the defendant was not subject to criminal prosecution and instead should have been charged with a civil offense under G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 [32L].\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AfyD\"><em>Discussion. </em>The question presented is what effect, if any, \u00a7 32L, inserted by St. 2008, c. 387, \u201cAn Act establishing a sensible State marihuana policy\u201d (Act), has on the offense of cultivation under \u00a7 32C <em>(a), </em>where the amount of marijuana cultivated weighs one ounce or less. We begin with the text of the relevant statutes. Section 32C <em>(a), </em>provides, in pertinent part: \u201cAny person who knowingly or intentionally manufactures, distributes, dispenses or cultivates, or possesses with intent to manufacture, distribute, dispense or cultivate [marijuana] shall be imprisoned . . . .\u201d On November 4, 2008, the voters approved the Act, which changed the status of the offense of possession of one ounce or less of marijuana from criminal to civil. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cruz, </em>459 Mass. 459, 464 (2011). Section 2 of the Act, codified at \u00a7 32L, provides in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b793-5\">\u201cNotwithstanding any general or special law to the contrary, possession of one ounce or less of marihuana shall only be a civil offense, subjecting an offender who is eighteen years of age or older to a civil penalty . . . but not to any other form of criminal or civil punishment or disqualification. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b793-6\">\u201cNothing contained herein shall be construed to repeal or modify existing laws . . . concerning the operation of motor vehicles or other actions taken while under the influence of marihuana or tetrahydrocannabinol, laws concem-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"776\">*776</page-number>ing the unlawful possession of prescription forms of marihuana or tetrahydrocannabinol . . . , possession of more than one ounce of marihuana or tetrahydrocannabinol, or selling, manufacturing or trafficking in marihuana or tetrahydrocannabinol. Nothing contained herein shall prohibit a political subdivision of the Commonwealth from enacting ordinances or bylaws regulating or prohibiting the consumption of marihuana or tetrahydrocannabinol in public places and providing for additional penalties for the public use of marihuana or tetrahydrocannabinol. \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b794-5\">Additionally, \u00a7 5 of the Act specifically amended G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 34 (\u00a7 34), a statute that renders criminal the knowing or intentional possession of any controlled substance. Pursuant to this amendment, the possession of marijuana under \u00a7 34 remains criminal \u201c[ejxcept as provided in [\u00a7] 32L.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b794-6\">In the <em>Keefner </em>case, we addressed the effect of \u00a7 32L on the offense of possession with intent to distribute, which, like cultivation, is a crime defined by \u00a7 32C (a). We concluded that \u00a7 32L did not repeal the criminal status of, or penalties applicable to, the crime of possession with intent to distribute where the amount of marijuana so possessed is one ounce or less. <em>Keefner, </em>461 Mass, at 514. The defendant argues that <em>Keefner </em>does not control because cultivation does not implicate distribution and, by definition, the cultivation of one ounce or less of marijuana means possession of that quantity. Accordingly, the argument goes, because \u00a7 32L decriminalizes possession of one ounce or less of marijuana, it also decriminalizes its cultivation in that amount.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The defendant\u2019s argument presents a legal issue similar to the ques<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"777\">*777</page-number>tion presented in <em>Keefner, supra </em>at 508, and our reasoning in that case governs here.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-5\">It is well established that \u201c[a] statute is not to be deemed to repeal or supersede a prior statute in whole or in part in the absence of express words to that effect or of clear implication.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Harris, </em>443 Mass. 714, 725 (2005), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hayes, </em>372 Mass. 505, 512 (1977). See <em>Keefner, </em>461 Mass, at 513-514. Here, as in the <em>Keefner </em>case, the offense for which the defendant is charged, cultivation of marijuana, \u00a7 32C (a), and the offense of simple possession of marijuana, \u00a7 34, are \u201clisted separately in the General Laws, have different elements, and are distinct.\u201d <em>Keefner, supra </em>at 511.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-6\">By its terms, the Act decriminalized only \u201cpossession of one ounce or less of marihuana\u201d and correspondingly amended only \u00a7 34, the statute defining the crime of simple possession, to exempt possession of one ounce or less of marijuana from criminal status and penalties. See <em>Keefner, </em>461 Mass, at 512. The Act did not decriminalize any other type of conduct proscribed by G. L. c. 94C, and it did not amend any other provision in c. 94C other than \u00a7 34. We adhere to our view, see <em>Keefner, supra </em>at 511-512, that the Act\u2019s specific amendment of \u00a7 34 and of no other criminal penalty provision in c. 94C \u2014 including, notably, \u00a7 32C (a) \u2014 is persuasive evidence that the Act was not intended to decriminalize any offense defined in c. 94C other than simple possession of one ounce or less of marijuana.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-7\">Moreover, the defendant offers no persuasive argument for why we should find an implied repeal of the provision in \u00a7 32C (a) proscribing cultivation when we declined to do so in relation to the provision in the very same section that proscribes possession with intent to distribute. <em>Keefner, </em>461 Mass, at 513-514. Adhering to the principle that \u201ca statute must be interpreted \u2018as a whole,\u2019 \u201d we conclude that \u00a7 32L did not repeal the offense of cultivation of marijuana under \u00a7 32C (a) where the amount of marijuana cultivated is one ounce or less.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> See <em>Keefner, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"778\">*778</page-number><em>supra </em>at 511, quoting <em>Wolfe </em>v. <em>Gormally, </em>440 Mass. 699, 704 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b796-5\">We address briefly the interpretation of \u00a7\u00a7 32C <em>(a) </em>and 32L proposed by Justice Duffly\u2019s concurring opinion, which is different from that offered by the defendant but is also flawed. The concurrence posits that (1) the term \u201ccultivation],\u201d as used in \u00a7 32C <em>(a), </em>does not include (and apparently has never included) cultivation of marijuana for \u201cpersonal use,\u201d see <em>post </em>at 780; (2) cultivation only comes within \u00a7 32C (a)\u2019s prohibition if it is undertaken with the intent to distribute (i.e., sell), see <em>id. </em>at 780-781; and (3) with the passage of \u00a7 32L, cultivation of one ounce or less of marijuana for personal use \u201cis not a crime.\u201d See <em>id. </em>at 782. This interpretation ignores the plain language of \u00a7 32C <em>(a) </em>and flies in the face of our guiding principles of statutory construction.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-6\">Section 32C <em>(a) </em>uses the word \u201ccultivate\u201d by itself. The section contains no language creating an exception for cultivation for \u201cpersonal use\u201d or indeed any exception at all. In interpreting a statute, \u201c[w]e will not add words to a statute that the Legislature did not put there, either by inadvertent omission or by design.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Callahan, 440 Mass. 436, 443 (2003), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McLeod, </em>437 Mass. 286, 294 (2002). Moreover, as the concurrence acknowledges, <em>post </em>at 780, the word \u201ccultivate\u201d has a plain, ordinary meaning: \u201cTo grow or tend (a plant or crop).\u201d American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language 454 (3d ed. 1992). Our rules of statutory construction counsel that when the meaning of a word used in a statute is clear, we should interpret it in accordance with that meaning, without more.* ****<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> See G. L. c. 4, \u00a7 6 (\u201cWords and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"779\">*779</page-number>phrases shall be construed according to the common and approved usage of the language\u201d); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Poissant, </em>443 Mass. 558, 563 (2005), quoting <em>Civitarese </em>v. <em>Middlebor-ough, </em>412 Mass. 695, 700 (1992) (\u201cWe will not read into the plain words of a statute a legislative intent that is not expressed by those words\u201d). Compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rahim, </em>441 Mass. 273, 277-278 (2004) (adhering to plain language where meaning of statute was clear), with, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Scott, ante </em>355,358 (2013) (where meaning of statutory term is ambiguous, appropriate to look at language of statute as whole), and <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hamilton, </em>459 Mass. 422, 431-433 (2011), citing <em>81 Spooner Rd. LLC </em>v. <em>Brookline, </em>452 Mass. 109, 115 (2008) (where statutory language is ambiguous, appropriate to look to legislative history). As the quoted definition indicates, the word \u201ccultivate\u201d refers to the process of growing a plant or crop, not the purpose for which the plant or crop is grown.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Accordingly, we hold that the cultivation of one ounce or less of marijuana, regardless of its intended use, is a criminal offense under \u00a7 32C (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b797-5\"><em>Conclusion. </em>The allowance of the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss is reversed, and the case is remanded to the District Court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b792-7\">According to the arresting officer, the closet also contained several lights, a large piece of foil, an electric timer device for the lights, a thermometer on the wall just above the plants, several packages of fertilizer, plastic bottles containing a liquid that the officer assumed was plant food or fertilizer, several glass smoking devices, empty clear plastic baggies, marijuana seeds, and a cardboard box with several prescription bottles inside, some of which had no labels.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b792-8\">The criminal complaint charged the defendant with \u201cknowingly or intentionally possessing] with intent to manufacture, distribute, dispense or cultivate a controlled substance in Class D of G.

L. c. 94C, \u00a7 32C <em>(a).\u201d </em>However, the arresting officer\u2019s statement of facts in support of an application for a criminal complaint alleged that the defendant was charged with \u201cCultivation of Marijuana,\u201d the Commonwealth has proceeded on the theory that the defendant violated only the prohibition on \u201ccultivation\u201d in G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 32C <em>(a) </em>(\u00a7 32C [a]), and the judge treated the charge as cultivation pursuant to \u00a7 32C (a).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b793-7\">The District Court judge was the same judge who allowed the motion to dismiss in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Keefner, </em>461 Mass. 507, 509 (2012) <em>(Keefner), </em>and he incorporated by reference its legal reasoning in his memorandum of decision and order in this case. In that case, the judge had dismissed a charge of possession with intent to distribute under \u00a7 32C <em>(a) </em>on the ground that Keefner possessed less than one ounce of marijuana and under G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 32L (\u00a7 32L), inserted by St. 2008, c. 387 (Act), possession of less than one ounce of marijuana with intent to distribute was no longer a criminal offense. In <em>Keefner, supra </em>at 518, this court reversed the allowance of Keefner\u2019s motion to dismiss more than one year after the judge allowed the motion to dismiss in the present case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b794-7\">The defendant also argues that \u00a7 32L \u201cspecifically exceptfs]\u201d marijuana from the definition of a class D substance under G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 31 (\u00a7 31), where such definition would result in prosecution for possession of one ounce or less of marijuana. We disagree. Section 31 lists the substances that come within each of the five classes of controlled substances \u201c[f]or the purposes of establishing criminal penalties for violation of a provision of [chapter 94C].\u201d Under \u00a7 31, a \u201cclass D\u201d substance includes, \u201c[ujnless specifically excepted . . . , any material . . . which contains any quantity of . . . Marihuana.\u201d Thus, \u00a7 31 defines what qualifies as class D in terms of the nature of the substance; it does not permit a substance\u2019s status as class D to change depending on its quantity. Section 32L therefore cannot be read to \u201cspecifically except\u201d from class D marijuana possessed in a quantity equal to or less than one ounce; it solely decriminalizes possession of that amount of the class D substance.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b795-8\">Finally, the practical difficulties associated in enforcing \u00a7 32L\u2019s weight-based minimum in the context of cultivation further support our conclusion that the Act did not decriminalize the cultivation of one ounce or less of marijuana. Marijuana subject to possession penalties typically is confiscated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"778\">*778</page-number>and weighed in its dried, leaf form. However, cultivation involves marijuana in the form of live plants, including stems and roots. The Act\u2019s minimum weight allowance did not provide any indication as to how live plants should be weighed to determine whether their weight exceeds the one-ounce statutory minimum.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b796-12\">The other three words used in \u00a7 32C <em>(a), </em>\u201cmanufacture,\u201d \u201cdistribute,\u201d and \u201cdispense,\u201d are all specifically defined in G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 1. The statute does not define \u201ccultivate.\u201d It is particularly appropriate, therefore, to interpret the word according to its common usage. See <em>Schulman </em>v. <em>Attorney Gen., </em>447 Mass. 189, 191 (2006), quoting <em>Mazzone </em>v. <em>Attorney Gen., </em>432 Mass. 515, 526 (2000) (Legislature presumed to employ statutory terms in manner consistent with their \u201ccommon and approved usage\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b797-8\">There are a number of additional reasons the concurrence\u2019s interpretation of the term \u201ccultivation]\u201d in \u00a7 32C (a) is problematic. For example, in concluding that cultivation of one ounce or less of marijuana for personal use is decriminalized or not a crime under \u00a7 32L, see <em>post </em>at 780, 782, the concurrence is, or logically must be, defining cultivation in that context as \u201cpossession,\u201d because \u00a7 32L by its terms provides only that <em>\u201cpossession </em>of one ounce or less of marihuana shall only be a civil offense\u201d (emphasis supplied). If \u201ccultivation]\u201d and \u201cpossession\u201d mean the same thing, however, then \u00a7 32C (fl)\u2019s proscription against \u201ccultivation],\u201d which the concurrence reads to prohibit only cultivation with intent to distribute, essentially would become superfluous. This follows because \u00a7 32C <em>(a) </em>expressly and separately prohibits possession with intent to distribute a controlled substance, including marijuana. It is a cardinal principle of statutory interpretation that \u201c[n]one of the words of a statute is to be regarded as superfluous.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Woods Hole, Martha\u2019s Vineyard &amp; Nantucket S.S. Auth., </em>352 Mass. 617, 618 (1967).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b797-7\">Duffly, J.</author>\n<p id=\"aph-dedup-1\">(concurring, with whom Gants and Lenk, JJ., join). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"780\">*780</page-number>I agree with the court that the enactment of G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 32L (\u00a7 32L), did not repeal by implication the separate offense of cultivation set forth in G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 32C <em>(\u00e1) </em>(\u00a7 32C [a]), where the amount of marijuana grown weighs one ounce or less, but I write separately because I believe that \u00a7 32L did decriminalize the growing of one ounce or less of marijuana for personal use. Here, the criminal complaint alleges that the defendant grew marijuana with the intent to distribute it, and the facts alleged support probable cause to believe the defendant committed that offense.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Because the allegations in the complaint suffice to withstand the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Green, </em>399 Mass. 565, 566 (1987) (complaint will not be dismissed if offense is charged with sufficient clarity to show violation of law and to permit defendant to know nature of accusation against him), I concur in the court\u2019s decision to reverse the order allowing the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-5\">When read in the context of G. L. c. 94C in its entirety, it is evident that the offense of cultivation excludes the growing of marijuana when it is done only for personal use. Section 32C <em>(a) </em>makes it a crime to manufacture, distribute, dispense, or cultivate marijuana, or to possess marijuana with the intent to manufacture, distribute, dispense, or cultivate it.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> General Laws c. 94C does not define \u201ccultivate,\u201d but the ordinary meaning of the word is \u201c[t]o grow or tend (a plant or crop).\u201d American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language 454 (3d ed. 1992). As used in \u00a7 32C <em>(a), </em>however, the word \u201ccultivate\u201d must be interpreted more narrowly, in light of the first three words in the phrase: manufacture, distribute, and dispense. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"781\">*781</page-number><em>Scott, ante </em>355, 359 (2013), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Brooks, </em>366 Mass. 423,428 (1974) (\u201cwords in a statute must be considered in light of the other words surrounding them\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b799-5\">Each of the first three terms connotes significant steps in the course of drug trafficking, and possession solely for personal use of the drugs is not included in their definitions. By statute, the term \u201cmanufacture\u201d explicitly \u201cdoes not include the preparation or compounding of a controlled substance by an individual for his own use.\u201d G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 1. Distribution is \u201cthe facilitation of a drug transfer from seller to buyer\u201d in furtherance of the drug trafficking business. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jackson, ante </em>758, 764 (2013). See G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 1. And the term \u201cdispense\u201d means the delivery of a controlled substance to an end user by a \u201cpractitioner\u201d who is \u201cregistered.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Just as possession for personal use is excluded from the definitions of manufacturing, distributing, and dispensing drugs, the term \u201ccultivate\u201d should also be read to exclude the growing of marijuana only for personal use.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-6\">The legislative history of \u00a7 32C (a) supports this interpretation. The Legislature enacted \u00a7 32C (a) to target those \u201cin the drug business.\u201d 1980 House Doc. No. 6652, at 1. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jackson, supra. </em>As the Governor explained when proposing the 1980 legislation that added this statute to the General Laws, \u201cThe time has come to launch a new, more aggressive campaign against <em>those who operate and profit </em>from the death-dealing traffic in drugs. . . . We need major changes in the way our criminal system deals with <em>these dealers in drugs.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) <em>Id. </em>Growing marijuana for personal use does not implicate such concerns. Indeed, growing marijuana for personal use arguably undermines the drug trafficking business, along with its attendant violence, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cannon, </em>449 Mass. 462, 470 (2007), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Moses, </em>408 Mass. 136, 143 (1990) (\u201cdrug trafficking is fraught with violence\u201d), by allowing marijuana users to obtain marijuana without supporting the drug trafficking market.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-7\">Moreover, the offense of cultivation must be considered in light of \u00a7 32L, which makes the simple possession of one ounce or less of marijuana a civil infraction. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Keefner, </em>461 Mass. 507, 511 (2012), quoting <em>Wolfe </em>v. <em>Gormally, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"782\">*782</page-number>440 Mass. 699, 704 (2004) (\u201ca statute must be interpreted \u2018as a whole\u2019; it is improper to confine interpretation to the single section to be construed\u201d). Section 32L, third par., identifies only four categories of existing laws that shall not be \u201cconstrued to [be] repealed] or modified].\u201d Among the laws explicitly unaffected by the enactment of \u00a7 32L are laws concerning the \u201cselling, manufacturing or trafficking\u201d in marijuana. G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 32L, third par. Significantly, \u201ccultivation\u201d is not included among the categories not subject to repeal or modification by the enactment of \u00a7 32L. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Russ R., </em>433 Mass. 515, 521 (2001), quoting <em>Police Comm\u2019r of Boston </em>v. <em>Cecil, </em>431 Mass. 410, 413 (2000) (\u201ca statutory expression of one thing is an implied exclusion of other things omitted from the statute\u201d). Although we held in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Keefner, supra </em>at 514, that this list \u201ccannot be construed as exhaustive,\u201d we recognized also that the passage of \u00a7 32L may have limited the reach of \u00a7 32C <em>(a). </em>We noted in that case that \u201cthe extent of all acts that are proscribed by the term \u2018distribute\u2019 under \u00a7 32C (a)\u201d remained to be decided, despite the absence of any explicit amendment to \u00a7 32C <em>(a). </em>See <em>id. </em>at 512, 515. Indeed, we have decided today that the social sharing of a decriminalized amount of marijuana does not constitute the offense of distribution. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jackson, supra </em>at 764-765.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-4\">In light of the enactment of \u00a7 32L, I believe it is clear that the growing of one ounce or less of marijuana for personal use is not a crime. Section \u00a7 32L was enacted as a result of the voters\u2019 adoption in 2008 of \u201cAn Act establishing a sensible State marihuana policy.\u201d St. 2008, c. 387. The goal of this initiative was to decriminalize possession of marijuana while keeping in place \u201cother marijuana-related crimes, like sales.\u201d Information for Voters: 2008 Ballot Questions, Question 2: Law Proposed by Initiative Petition, Possession of Marijuana.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> By defining the offense of cultivation to cover the growing of marijuana for personal use, the court\u2019s decision today leaves no noncriminal means by which to obtain a decriminalized amount of marijuana. I fail to see how such a policy is \u201csensible.\u201d See <em>Commonwealth </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"783\">*783</page-number>v. <em>Keefner, supra </em>at 514 (\u201cthe intent expressed by the Legislature [is] that, generally speaking, controlled substances are not to be obtained \u2018on the street\u2019 \u201d). Cf. <em>Herman </em>v. <em>Admit One Ticket Agency LLC, </em>454 Mass. 611, 618 (2009) (title of act can be useful tool of statutory interpretation).</p>\n<p id=\"b801-4\">Treating marijuana cultivation for personal use in the same manner as simple possession is treated under \u00a7 32L, a civil infraction, is also consistent with the recent enactment of G. L. c. 94C Appendix \u00a7\u00a7 1-1 et seq., inserted by St. 2012, c. 369. That statute, which legalizes the medical use of marijuana by qualifying patients, also recognizes the interconnection between possession, use, and cultivation of marijuana for personal use. Pursuant to G. L. c. 94C Appendix \u00a7 1-11, a \u201cqualifying patient\u201d may in certain circumstances obtain a \u201ccultivation registration,\u201d which \u201cshall allow the patient or the patient\u2019s personal caregiver to cultivate a limited number of plants, sufficient to maintain a 60-day supply of marijuana, and shall require cultivation and storage only in an enclosed, locked facility.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b801-5\">Where the language of two statutory provisions must be considered, we interpret their meaning \u201cin a manner that, to the greatest extent possible, serves the policies underlying both.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Harris, </em>443 Mass. 714, 726 (2005). Interpreting the term \u201ccultivate\u201d in \u00a7 32C <em>(a) </em>to exclude growing marijuana for personal use respects both the policies underlying \u00a7 32L (decriminalizing possession of marijuana while continuing to criminalize the sale of marijuana) and \u00a7 32C <em>(a) </em>(targeting drug trafficking). By adopting a broader interpretation of the offense of cultivation than is necessary to resolve this case, the court\u2019s decision fails to advance these legislative goals.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b798-6\">The statement of facts in support of the application for a criminal complaint alleges that officers of the Adams police department discovered in the defendant\u2019s home several marijuana plants, along with several glass smoking devices, empty clear plastic bags, and a cardboard box containing several prescription bottles, some of which had no labels.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b798-7\">General Laws c. 94C, \u00a7 32C <em>(a), </em>provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b798-8\">\u201cAny person who knowingly or intentionally manufactures, distributes, dispenses or cultivates, or possesses with intent to manufacture, distribute, dispense or cultivate a controlled substance in Class D of section thirty-one shall be imprisoned in a jail or house of correction for not more than two years or by a fine of not less than five hundred nor more than five thousand dollars, or both such fine and imprisonment.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b800-5\"> \u201cWe assume that before casting their votes, voters read the arguments \u2018for\u2019 and \u2018against,\u2019 as well as the new law itself.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cruz, </em>459 Mass. 459, 471 (2011).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
