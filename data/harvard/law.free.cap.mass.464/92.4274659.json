L. c. 276, \u00a7 38 (\u00a7 38), and, if so, when the probable cause hearing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>described in \u00a7 38 must be held.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We conclude that \u00a7 38 is applicable to such a defendant and provides the defendant with the right to a probable cause hearing as soon as practicable in the circumstances. For the reasons we shall discuss, we decline to adopt a bright-line rule that would require the Commonwealth to conduct the probable cause hearing within thirty days or another definite time frame, but we conclude that because the probable cause hearing is an important stage in a criminal proceeding, the Commonwealth must demonstrate good cause to justify any request by the Commonwealth to continue it.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-5\"><em>Background. </em>On May 7, 2010, Cordell McAfee was shot and killed on the front porch of a house in the Dorchester section of Boston.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> On December 20, 2010, a criminal complaint issued against the defendant, charging him with the murder of McAfee and the unlawful carrying of a firearm. The defendant was arrested in Rhode Island on January 18, 2011, and a judge in the Dorchester Division of the Boston Municipal Court Department (District Court; see note 1, supra) arraigned the defendant on the charges on January 21, 2011.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-6\">At the defendant\u2019s arraignment, the judge scheduled a probable cause hearing to be held on February 17, 2011. See Mass. R. Crim. R 7 (b) (4), as appearing in 461 Mass. 1502 (2012).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>On that date, the prosecutor requested a continuance.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The judge granted the requested continuance and scheduled a second date for the probable cause hearing in thirty days, to be held on March 16, 2011. At the March 16 hearing, the prosecutor requested another thirty-day continuance with an explanation that the Commonwealth needed additional time to obtain deoxy-ribonucleic acid evidence; she asked for a probable cause hearing date of April 15, 2011. Over objection of the defendant, the judge granted the requested continuance and rescheduled the probable cause hearing for April 15. On March 16 as well, the defendant filed a motion to dismiss or for release, arguing that the successive continuances of the probable cause hearing violated his liberty interests, given that he remained in custody during these delays. The judge denied the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-5\">Thereafter, on March 24, 2011, the defendant filed a petition in the county court pursuant to G. L. c. 211, \u00a7 3, seeking an order that a probable cause hearing be held in the District Court as soon as possible and not later than April 15, 2011, and requesting in the alternative that the single justice dismiss the pending complaint against the defendant. Before the defendant\u2019s petition was heard by the single justice, at the scheduled April 15 hearing in the District Court, the prosecutor requested another continuance. She argued that, due to delays reaching the witnesses, the Commonwealth was unable to complete the grand jury investigation, and she stated that the grand jury was scheduled to meet again on May 6, 2011. The defendant again objected to a continuance, and filed a renewed motion to dismiss. The judge granted the Commonwealth\u2019s requested continuance and denied the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss, setting May 9, 2011, as the next date for the probable cause hearing. The grand jury returned an indictment on May 7, 2011, charging the defendant with murder in the first degree. The probable cause hearing in the District Court never took place.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b112-6\">Before the indictment was returned, the single justice heard <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>the defendant\u2019s c. 211, \u00a7 3, petition on April 26, 2011, and on May 9, 2011, issued a memorandum of decision denying the requested relief.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> 8The defendant filed a timely appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-5\"><em>Discussion. </em>1. <em>Mootness. </em>As the defendant has been indicted and does not suggest that he would be entitled at this point either to a probable cause hearing or dismissal of the indictment, his petition for relief under G. L. c. 211, \u00a7 3, is moot. However, it is within the discretion of this court to answer questions that, due to circumstances, no longer may have direct significance to the parties but raise issues of public importance and, because of their nature, may be \u201ccapable of repetition, yet evading review.\u201d See <em>Lockhart </em>v. <em>Attorney Gen., </em>390 Mass. 780, 782-783 (1984), quoting <em>Wolf </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Pub. Welfare, </em>367 Mass. 293, 298 (1975), and cases cited. Cf. <em>Wellesley College </em>v. <em>Attorney Gen., </em>313 Mass. 722, 731 (1943).</p>\n<p id=\"b113-6\">Whether a person charged and held on a District Court complaint for murder in the first degree is entitled to a probable cause hearing in the District Court and, if so, the timing of such a hearing and the relationship between a person\u2019s right to that hearing and the Commonwealth\u2019s right to initiate grand jury proceedings are issues that implicate the liberty interests of all defendants who are so situated, and more generally are significant for the proper administration of the criminal justice system. These issues have been briefed fully by the parties, and we will consider them.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-7\">2. <em>Probable cause hearings for defendants held on a complaint of murder, </em>a. <em>Introduction. </em>It is useful to set out the text of the two statutes that give rise to the issues just summarized.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-8\">General Laws c. 276, \u00a7 38, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b113-9\">\u201cThe court or justice1<footnotemark>8</footnotemark>1 before whom a person is taken upon a charge of crime shall, <em>as soon as may be, </em>examine on oath the complainant and the witnesses for the prosecution, in the presence of the defendant, relative to any material matter connected with such charge. After the testimony <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>to support the prosecution, the witnesses for the prisoner, if any, shall be examined on oath, and he may be assisted by counsel in such examination and in the cross examination of the witnesses in support of the prosecution. Nothing contained herein shall be construed to prohibit the enforcement of the waiver provisions of Rule 3 of the Massachusetts Rules of Criminal Procedure. A defendant charged with an offense as to which he has the right to be proceeded against by indictment may elect a probable cause hearing in accordance with Rule 3 of the Massachusetts Rules of Criminal Procedure, but in such event shall be deemed to have waived his right to be proceeded against by indictment.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b114-16\">General Laws c. 263, \u00a7 4A (\u00a7 4A), provides in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b114-17\">\u201cA defendant charged in the district court with an offense as to which he has the right to be proceeded against by indictment shall have the right, <em>except when the offense charged is a capital crime,</em><footnotemark><em>9</em></footnotemark><em> </em>to waive that right, whereupon the court shall have as full jurisdiction of the complaint as if an indictment had been found. If a defendant is so charged and requests a probable cause hearing in district court, that request shall constitute a waiver of the right to be proceeded against by indictment and the prosecution may proceed upon the complaint. If a defendant waives the right to be proceeded against by indictment, a probable cause hearing shall be held in the district court unless the defendant waives the probable cause hearing or unless the prosecutor elects to proceed by indictment pursuant to the Massachusetts Rules of Criminal Procedure.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b115-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>The single justice implicitly determined that \u00a7 38, with its provision for a probable cause hearing in the District Court, applied to the defendant. However, the single justice concluded that a District Court judge maintains discretion to continue a scheduled probable cause hearing, and he found no abuse of discretion in the continuances granted by the District Court judge in the defendant\u2019s case.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-5\">The defendant argues that the single justice committed an error of law in denying the defendant\u2019s request for an immediate probable cause hearing or dismissal of the District Court complaint. He contends that \u00a7 38 protects a defendant who is charged in the District Court but subject to being bound over to the Superior Court from being held in custody without a neutral assessment, within a short time after the prosecution actually begins, of whether there is probable cause to support the charges against him.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> In particular, the defendant points to \u00a7 3 8 \u2019 s requirement that a judge conduct a probable cause hearing to review the charges \u201cas soon as may be,\u201d a time frame that he argues should be no more than thirty days from the date of arraignment. He views a limit of thirty days as consistent with (1) Mass. R. Crim. R 7 (b) (4), as appearing in 461 Mass. 1501 (2012) (see note 4, <em>supra), </em>directing a District Court judge to schedule a probable cause hearing at the time of arraignment on any complaint that is beyond the jurisdiction of that court; and (2) G. L. c. 276, \u00a7 35, which prohibits at any one time the continuance beyond thirty days of any hearing or trial in the District Court involving a defendant held in custody. He contends that if any continuance beyond thirty days is permissible, it must only be in \u201cexceptional circumstances\u201d that do not include scheduling or completing grand jury presentations.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-6\">The Commonwealth, on the other hand, asserts that a defendant charged with murder in the first degree has no right to a probable cause hearing under \u00a7 38. The argument is that under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>both \u00a7\u00a7 4A and 38, the right to a probable cause hearing only exists for a defendant who is authorized to, and does, waive his right to an indictment and elects in its stead a probable cause hearing; and that because under \u00a7 4A, a defendant charged with murder in the first degree is expressly prohibited from making such a waiver, he has no corresponding right to a probable cause hearing. We consider first the Commonwealth\u2019s claim.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b116-4\">b. <em>Availability of probable cause hearings to defendants charged by complaint with murder in the first degree. </em>Considering \u00a7 38 and \u00a7 4A together, we conclude that the Commonwealth\u2019s argument lacks merit. Section 38 by its terms provides for a probable cause hearing in cases where a defendant is charged with a crime in the District Court that lies beyond the jurisdiction of that court and for which the defendant is entitled to be proceeded against by indictment. See <em>Corey </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>364 Mass. 137, 140-141 (1973) <em>(Corey); Myers </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>363 Mass. 843, 846-847, 857 (1973) <em>(Myers). </em>See also <em>Lataille </em>v. <em>District Court of E. Hampden, </em>366 Mass. 525, 528-529 (1974) <em>(Lataille). </em>In providing this statutory right, \u00a7 38 makes no distinction between a charge of murder in the first degree and any other crime, and indeed makes no mention of murder or a \u201ccapital crime\u201d at all. It is true that the final two sentences of \u00a7 38, added in 1985, see St. 1985, c. 256, reference the waiver provisions of Mass. R. Crim. R 3 as then in ef-feet, see 378 Mass. 847 (1979),<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> and specifically state that any election of a probable cause hearing in accordance with rule 3 operates as a waiver of the right to be proceeded against by indictment. But the same version of rule 3 also provided that a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>defendant charged with murder in the first degree (i.e., a \u201ccapital crime\u201d) was not permitted to waive indictment. Mass. R. Crim. R 3 (b) (2), as appearing in 378 Mass. 847.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Accordingly, we read the waiver mandate added to \u00a7 38 in 1985 as simply inapplicable to a defendant in the position of the defendant here, i.e., a defendant charged with murder in the first degree; just as such a defendant was covered by and entitled to a probable cause hearing under the general terms of \u00a7 38 before 1985, he remained so thereafter.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-5\">Section 4A in relevant part essentially tracks the same waiver provisions that were incorporated into the original version of Mass. R. Crim. P. 3 and added by reference to \u00a7 38 in 1985.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Thus, \u00a7 4A requires a defendant who is charged in the District Court with an offense for which he has a right to be proceeded against by indictment, <em>other </em>than murder in the first degree, to waive the indictment right in order to obtain a probable cause hearing in the District Court. Because the defendant here is charged with murder in the first degree, the waiver provision in \u00a7 4A is irrelevant and does not infringe on his independent right to a probable cause hearing under \u00a7 38.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b118-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>Both before and after the 1979 amendment to \u00a7 4A (see note 14, <em>supra), </em>this court consistently has interpreted \u00a7 38 and its probable cause hearing requirement to apply to defendants charged with murder in the first degree. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Daye, </em>435 Mass. 463, 468-470 (2001); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fisher, </em>433 Mass. 340, 347 (2001); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Santos, </em>402 Mass. 775, 786 (1988); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Spann, </em>383 Mass. 142, 145 (1981); <em>Lataille, </em>366 Mass, at 530-531. The Commonwealth\u2019s argument here does not persuade us to alter this established interpretation of \u00a7 38. We conclude, therefore, that while the defendant remained in custody pursuant to a District Court complaint for murder, \u00a7 38 applied to him and provided him with the right to a probable cause hearing in accordance with its terms.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> We therefore turn to \u00a7 38 to examine those terms.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-5\">c. <em>Timing of the probable cause hearing under G. L. c. 276, \u00a7 38. </em>As the <em>Myers </em>and <em>Corey </em>cases describe, probable cause hearings protect significant liberty interests of defendants who ultimately will be tried in the Superior Court. See <em>Corey, </em>364 Mass, at 141; <em>Myers, </em>363 Mass, at 847. The defendant points to these two cases as supporting, if not compelling, the conclusion that under \u00a7 38 he was entitled to a probable cause hearing in short order following his arraignment.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> But in both <em>Myers </em>and <em>Corey, </em>the defendants actually received probable cause hear<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>ings, and the court\u2019s focus was solely on the manner in which those hearings had been conducted; there was no issue raised in either case about what is central to the defendant\u2019s concerns here, namely, the timing of the probable cause hearing and the relationship between the timing of the hearing and the initiation of grand jury proceedings by the Commonwealth for the purpose of obtaining an indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-5\">Section 38 directs that the probable cause hearing occur \u201cas soon as may be\u201d after arraignment, and this phrase must be interpreted in a manner consistent with the legislative purpose of that statute. See <em>District Attorney for the N. Dist. </em>v. <em>School Comm. of Wayland, </em>455 Mass. 561, 568 569 (2009), quoting <em>Board of Educ. </em>v. <em>Assessor of Worcester, </em>368 Mass. 511, 513 514 (1975). In <em>Myers, </em>363 Mass, at 847, and <em>Corey, </em>364 Mass, at 141, this court stated that the \u201cprimary function\u201d of the \u00a7 38 probable cause hearing is to \u201cscreen out at this early but critical stage of the criminal process those cases that should not go to trial, thereby sparing individuals from being held for trial, and from being unjustifiably prosecuted.\u201d <em>Myers, supra. </em>See <em>Corey, supra </em>at 140-142. The dual requirements that defendants may only be held for trial where the magistrate determines that (1) a crime has been committed, and (2) there is probable cause to believe a defendant guilty of the crime charged, see G. L. c. 276, \u00a7 42, create \u201can effective bind-over standard\u201d to eliminate groundless charges that should not go to trial. <em>Corey, supra </em>at 141. <em>Myers, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b119-6\">As set out in <em>Myers, </em>to establish probable cause under \u00a7 38, the Commonwealth must present sufficient credible evidence to meet the directed verdict standard, that is, \u201cwhether there is enough credible evidence to send the case to the jury.\u201d <em>Myers, </em>363 Mass, at 850. See generally <em>id. </em>at 848-850. Meeting this standard requires the presentation of substantially more evidence than is necessary in most cases for an indictment.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Practically speaking, therefore, \u201cas soon as may be\u201d must be interpreted in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>a manner that affords the Commonwealth enough time reasonably to marshal and present the quantity and quality of evidence that is necessary to meet the probable cause hearing\u2019s heightened probable cause standard. Interpreting the phrase as the defendant suggests, that is, by imposing a rigid thirty-day requirement in which the Commonwealth must be prepared to establish probable cause, would not meet this need.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-10\">What we have just stated about the meaning of \u201cas soon as may be\u201d is based on a consideration of the nature of the \u00a7 38 probable cause hearing. However, as \u00a7 38 expressly reflects, there are crimes for which a defendant has a right, constitutionally protected, to be proceeded against by indictment. Furthermore, as recognized by statute and court rule, the Commonwealth may elect to proceed by indictment even if the defendant would be willing to waive the right. See G. L. c. 263, \u00a7 4A; Mass. R. Crim. R 3 (e), as appearing in 442 Mass. 1502 (2004). We have recognized that an indictment offers an \u201calternative means [to a probable cause hearing] for establishing probable cause to hold a defendant for trial.\u201d <em>Lataille, </em>366 Mass, at 530-531.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Given that a defendant and the Commonwealth each have a right <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>respectively to be charged and to charge by indictment, it makes sense to construe the phrase \u201cas soon as may be\u201d in \u00a7 38 with the indictment alternative in mind; indeed, it is especially appropriate to do so in a case such as this, where, because the charge is murder in the first degree, the Commonwealth is required to proceed by indictment and the defendant cannot waive it. G. L. c. 263, \u00a7 4A.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-5\">In sum, we conclude that the phrase \u201cas soon as may be\u201d in \u00a7 38 is best interpreted to mean that the probable cause hearing is to be held as soon as reasonably practicable in the circumstances presented \u2014 circumstances that may include, as here, the requirement that the Commonwealth proceed by indictment or, in a noncapital case, the election of the Commonwealth to do so. The phrase cannot be defined, as the defendant would have it, by establishing in advance a fixed number of days within which the hearing must be held, because the particular circumstances of each case will be different.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b121-6\">In construing the phrase \u201cas soon as may be\u201d in this manner, we do not intend to suggest that a judge is free to continue a scheduled probable cause hearing as a matter of course or simply based on a prosecutor\u2019s statement that the Commonwealth needs more time. The important purpose of the \u00a7 38 probable cause hearing \u2014 to prevent the defendant from being held for trial on a groundless or unmeritorious charge, see <em>Corey, </em>364 Mass, at 141; <em>Myers, </em>363 Mass, at 847 \u2014 remains a central consideration. The Commonwealth is not entitled to proceed at whatever pace it might choose, either in marshaling evidence to establish probable cause for the probable cause hearing or in presenting a case to the grand jury in order to secure an indictment. And a judge may not simply rubber stamp a Commonwealth\u2019s request for a continuance. Rather, if the Commonwealth seeks to continue <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>the probable cause hearing beyond the date scheduled at arraignment or thereafter, the judge\u2019s responsibility is to make a meaningful inquiry into the specific reasons for the request, and to consider whether the Commonwealth has shown good cause for it. An active, ongoing grand jury investigation should be considered as a factor, but an ongoing grand jury investigation, taken by itself, is not necessarily sufficient to demonstrate good cause; among other factors, the amount of time the defendant has been held in custody and the time that has elapsed since arraignment should be weighed. Finally, in light of the bright-line rule set out in G. L. c. 276, \u00a7 35,<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> where a defendant is being held in custody, any one continuance of the probable cause hearing may not exceed thirty days.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-4\">If the Commonwealth does not provide good cause for a continuance, as the single justice suggested, the judge should consider directing the Commonwealth to proceed with the probable cause hearing; alternatively, the judge might dismiss the complaint or at least consider bail. A dismissal, of course, \u201cis not a bar to a subsequent indictment for the same offence.\u201d <em>Burke </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>373 Mass. 157, 159 (1977), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hamilton, </em>129 Mass. 479, 481 (1880). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Britt, </em>362 Mass. 325, 330 (1972). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Crowe, </em>21 Mass. App. Ct. 456, 471-472, cert. denied sub nom. <em>Pirrotta </em>v. <em>Massachusetts, </em>479 U.S. 838 (1986) (nolle prosequi of complaint does not ordinarily bar indictment).</p>\n<p id=\"b122-8\">Returning to the decision of the single justice, we conclude that he did not abuse his discretion or commit other error of law in denying the relief sought by the defendant. The single justice appeared to consider the existence of an ongoing grand jury investigation as perhaps a principal factor that would justify a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>continuance of the probable cause hearing, but he set out other important factors to consider in addition.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b123-5\"><em>Conclusion. </em>The defendant\u2019s appeal is dismissed as moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b110-14\">In the present case, the complaint issued from the Boston Municipal Court Department. In this opinion, we refer to the Boston Municipal Court Department and the District Court Department collectively as the District Court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b111-7\">The hearing conducted by a judge in the District Court pursuant to G. L. c. 276, \u00a7\u00a7 38-42, to determine whether there is probable cause to hold a defendant who has been charged with a crime beyond the jurisdiction of the District Court for trial in the Superior Court is sometimes referred to as a \u201cpreliminary hearing.\u201d See <em>Lataille </em>v. <em>District Court of E. Hampden, </em>366 Mass. 525, 528 (1974) <em>(Lataille). </em>However, the parties as well as some statutes and court rules use the term \u201cprobable cause\u201d hearing, see, e.g., G.

The meaning of the two terms is the same, and they often are used interchangeably. See, e.g., <em>Myers </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>363 Mass. 843, 844, 845-847, 851-852 (1973) <em>(Myers).</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b111-8\">The facts of the underlying homicide investigation and case are not directly relevant to this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b111-9\">Effective June 1, 2012, this court amended Mass.

P. 5.1(a) advisory committee\u2019s note (1972). Consequently, under Federal law the preliminary hearing truly fulfils its \u201cprimary function ... to screen out at this early but critical stage of the criminal process those cases that should not go to trial, thereby sparing individuals from being held for trial, and from being unjustifiably prosecuted.\u201d <em>Myers, supra </em>at 847. See <em>Lataille </em>v. <em>District Court of E.

As demonstrated by the attestations in eleven affidavits filed by criminal defense attorneys in this case, a probable cause hearing in a criminal case is virtually never conducted in the courts of Massachusetts; the only preliminary screening of a defendant\u2019s case is conducted by a grand jury, sometimes months after the initial appearance. For all practical purposes, in Massachusetts the probable cause hearing is a relic of the past, a theoretical entitlement that in practice is only rarely obtained.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-7\">The irony is that the reason why probable cause hearings have become as rare as Boston Red Sox championships is because, for the ostensibly benevolent purpose of protecting defendants from trial where the Commonwealth\u2019s case against them is too weak to obtain a conviction, we have made the prosecutor\u2019s burden of proof so high at such hearings, and have obligated the prosecutor to meet this burden with admissible evidence rather than reliable hearsay. See <em>Myers, supra </em>at 847, 850. In practice, our benevolence toward defendants has backfired: there is now virtually no judicial screening of criminal cases after arrest and a defendant may be held for months in custody before either a grand jury or a judge (almost invariably a grand jury) makes a determination of probable cause. Rather than helping defendants escape \u201cgroundless or unsupported charges\u201d or \u201csparing individuals from being held for trial,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 847, the heightened standard we announced in <em>Myers </em>has had the unintended result of criminal defendants being held for extended periods without judicial screening to allow the Commonwealth sufficient time to meet the more demanding \u201cdirected verdict\u201d standard or, more likely, to obtain a grand jury indictment. Where, as here, a defendant is charged with a capital crime, the Commonwealth is likely to have even more abundant \u201cgood cause\u201d for requesting a continuance of the probable cause hearing, <em>ante </em>at 103-104, because the Commonwealth will need <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>adequate time to conduct forensic testing and to subpoena key civilian witnesses before the grand jury to \u201clock in\u201d their testimony before they testify at trial. In short, by setting the directed verdict standard announced in <em>Myers </em>as the standard for probable cause at a hearing under G. L. c. 276, \u00a7\u00a7 38-42, we have set so rigorous a judicial screen that we now effectively have no judicial screening at all, and some criminal defendants will be unjustly held for an extended period of time even though the evidence against them could not survive an independent review of probable cause even under the Federal standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-5\">Like the Federal courts, a \u201csubstantial majority of jurisdictions reject[s] both the prima facie [directed verdict] standard and the mini-trial type of preliminary hearing,\u201d which allows consideration only of evidence that would be admissible at trial. 4 W.R.

This does not, in practice, really benefit a defendant, but rather leads to confusion and comer-cutting. Very often there may be sufficient evidence for the issuance of a warrant of arrest or for an arrest without a warrant, but not enough evidence for a prima facie case. This may cause an arrested person to be held for a considerable time while the case is being investigated so that a complaint which spells out a prima facie case can be prepared. . . . Meanwhile, the defendant\u2019s main interest is in obtaining his release from custody. . . . One objective of the procedure proposed here is to promote promptness of the hearing as a matter of practice as well as requiring such promptness as a matter of law. ... In effect, if the evidence was sufficient for the issuance of a warrant of arrest or for an arrest without a warrant \u2014 all other things being equal \u2014 it should be sufficient to hold a person for the action of the grand jury.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b129-5\">Staff Comment, Proposed New York Criminal Procedure Law \u00a7 90.60, at 137-138 (1967), now codified at N.Y.

While the probable cause standard would be the same, the judicial screening of probable cause would be performed by a judge, not a clerk-magistrate, and would be adversarial in nature, with the defendant having the opportunity to cross-examine prosecution witnesses and call his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>own witnesses.

Until we revisit <em>Myers, </em>for all practical purposes the only determination of probable cause after arrest will be made by a grand jury at a time determined by the prosecutor that, depending on the nature of the case, may be many months after the defendant\u2019s initial appearance.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b123-9\">As addressed <em>ante </em>at note 2, the type of hearing in question has been called by several different names in our cases.

We declared in <em>Myers </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>363 Mass. 843, 850 (1973) <em>(Myers), </em>that a judge conducting a bind-over hearing \u201cshould view the case as if it were a trial and he were required to rule on whether there is enough credible evidence to send the case to the jury.\u201d And we directed that a judge \u201cshould dismiss the complaint when, on the evidence presented, a trial court would be bound to acquit as a matter of law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Under a directed verdict standard in a criminal case, a judge may send a case to a jury only where the evidence, viewed in the light most favorable to the prosecution, is sufficient to permit a rational fact finder to find proof beyond a reasonable doubt. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Latimore, </em>378 Mass. 671, 676-677 (1979). The <em>Myers </em>standard, however, seems to require a judge to consider only \u201ccredible\u201d evidence, <em>Myers, supra </em>at 848, 850, which may be a more demanding standard than that applied in considering a defendant\u2019s motion for a required finding of not guilty, where a judge makes no evaluation of credibility. But in <em>Myers, </em>we went on to declare that the \u201cminimum quantum of evidence required by this bind-over standard is more than that for probable cause for arrest but less than would \u2018prove the defendant\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 850, quoting <em>People </em>v. <em>Bieber, </em>100 N.Y.S.2d 821, 823 (N.Y.C. Magis. Ct. 1950). Because a directed verdict standard is defined as evidence legally sufficient to establish proof beyond a reasonable doubt, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Latimore, supra </em>at 676-677, it is not clear how a lower quantum of evidence than that would suffice to meet a \u201cdirected verdict\u201d standard. <em>Myers, supra </em>at 850.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"AN-\">The Federal equivalent to the Massachusetts probable cause hearing under G.

See <em>post </em>at 113 (Ireland, C.J., concurring). In general, I agree that we should await full briefing until we decide an issue, which is why, rather than suggest that we should decide this issue in the case before us, I suggested <em>supra </em>\u201cthat the standard of proof and the requirement of admissible evidence we established in <em>Myers </em>needs to be revisited in an appropriate case.\u201d To the extent that the concurrence suggests it is inappropriate to recognize that our present interpretation of the law governing probable cause hearings is proving to be dysfunctional because it results in criminal defendants being denied the opportunity to have a timely judicial determination whether there is probable cause to believe them guilty of a crime, I disagree, especially where, as here, the issue is likely to continue to elude review unless someone on the court expresses a willingness to revisit our decision in <em>Myers. </em>Even with such a willingness expressed, the issue is not easily presented on appeal. In the rare case where a defendant is granted a probable cause hearing, it would be unlikely that a defendant would claim on appeal that the directed verdict standard is too demanding a standard of probable cause and that the traditional probable cause standard is more appropriate. A prosecutor arguably could challenge the standard in the unusual case where a probable cause hearing is conducted and no probable cause is found under the <em>Myers </em>standard, but why would her office bring such an appeal if it may foreseeably result in more (and more timely) probable cause hearings, albeit under a traditional probable cause standard? Because a judicial fix of the dysfunction may be unlikely, the Legislature may need to step in to make the repair, as it did in New York State.

I agree entirely with the court. I write separately only to register my concerns about the concurring opinion that challenges the probable cause standard set forth in <em>Myers </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>363 Mass. 843 (1973). The concurrence acknowledges, as it must, that the issue it addresses \u2014 whether the <em>Myers </em>standard should be changed \u2014 was not raised or briefed by either side and is not essential to the resolution of this case. <em>Ante </em>at 112. It nevertheless goes on to discuss the issue in considerable detail and makes the case that the standard should be changed. This obviously would represent a significant change in Massachusetts law.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-5\">I do not think this court does its best work when we make up our minds and stake out our positions on significant legal issues like this, before the issues have even been raised by the parties, brought before us, and briefed and argued for our consideration.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> As an appellate court in an adversarial system, our principal responsibility is to consider the cases on appeal as they are presented to us by the parties; the very definition of an adversary system is that the parties, through their written and oral arguments, crystallize the issues for our consideration, and we then consider, digest, analyze, and test those arguments as we decide the cases. There are sound, time-tested reasons for this approach, not the least of which is that our decisions are better informed when the rules of law we discuss and apply (and sometimes cre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>ate or modify) have been vetted through the adversarial process of trial and appeal.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> See F.M. Coffin, On Appeal: Courts, Law-yering, and Judging 258 (W.W. Norton &amp; Co. 1994) (identifying \u201cfive fundamental features of our American appellate system that work to confine judicial discretion\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b132-5\">Of course there are times when we might need to address an issue that was not raised and preserved in the trial court; or when we might discuss an issue that is not absolutely necessary to the disposition of the appeal; or when we might decide the occasional moot case, where the issues are important and would otherwise escape appellate review. But even then we should be chary about discussing and deciding issues without the benefit of hearing both sides.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-6\">That said, and even though I was one of the counsel of record for the prevailing petitioner in the <em>Myers </em>case, I am not averse to revisiting that decision if and when it becomes appropriate to do so. I will wait to hear the arguments from both sides, however, and from any amici who might have information to contribute, before I reach any conclusions about whether the <em>Myers </em>standard should be retained or changed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b131-7\">I note that none of the eleven attorneys who submitted affidavits in support of the defendant\u2019s petition pursuant to G. L. c. 211, \u00a7 3, stated that he or she was concerned with the standard set forth in <em>Myers </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>363 Mass. 843 (1973). The concern was that, in practice, no probable cause hearings were held and that continuances were granted as a matter of course. Indeed, one attorney set forth the advantages that accrued in counties where probable cause hearings were held, averring, \u201c[T]he hearings were usually beneficial to both parties, allowing for greater and prompter discovery for the defense and . . . prosecution, allowing for testimony to be preserved, and providing an opportunity ... to weed out weak cases. . . . The defense was also better informed of the evidence, and . . . benefit[ted] by actually seeing the witnesses and evidence.\u201d See <em>Myers </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, supra </em>at 847-848, quoting <em>Coleman </em>v. <em>Alabama, 399 </em>U.S. 1, 9 (1970) (advantages of preliminary hearing are exposing weaknesses in State\u2019s case, using testimony to create impeachment tool for trial, discovering State\u2019s case in order to prepare effective defense, and making effective arguments for accused).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b132-7\">For example, the concurrence states that a \u201csubstantial majority of jurisdictions\u201d does not use the directed verdict standard set forth in <em>Myers </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, supra </em>at 850. <em>Ante </em>at 109 &amp; n.5. I point out that the court in the <em>Myers </em>case based the directed verdict standard on a study by the American Bar Association and on the draft of a model code. <em>Myers </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, supra </em>at 850 n.7, citing F. Miller, Prosecution: The Decision to Charge a Suspect With Crime (\u201cthis \u2018directed verdict\u2019 definition of probable cause is the most common screening standard practised in other States which have probable cause hearings\u201d), and Graham &amp; Letwin, The Preliminary Hearing in Los Angles, 18 UCLA L. Rev. 636, and American Law Institute, A Model Code of Pre-Arraignment Procedure (Tent. Draft No. 5) \u00a7 330.5(3) (\u201c[Probable] cause to hold the defendant for trial exists . . . when the evidence introduced at the preliminary hearing would support a guilty verdict\u201d). This seeming discrepancy presumably would have been vetted fully if the directed verdict standard was before the court. In addition, according to a memorandum of law that the defendant submitted in support of his petition for extraordinary relief pursuant to G. L. c. 211, \u00a7 3, many of the jurisdictions cited by the concurrence as having rejected the directed verdict standard have statutes or rules that, unlike the Commonwealth, have a very short time frame (fourteen days) for holding a probable cause hearing, or require the prosecution to demonstrate good cause or extraordinary circumstances to justify delay or continuance. The degree to which the rejection of a directed verdict standard is related to the existence of these rules and statutes would also have been vetted if the issue was properly before this court.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
