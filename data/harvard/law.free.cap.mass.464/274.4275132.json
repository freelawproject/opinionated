On May 12, 2010, more than ten years after the date of the armed robbery, a grand jury returned an indictment against the defendant for that offense. A judge of the Superior Court allowed the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss on the ground that the case was not properly initiated by indictment until after the statute of limitations had run.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-14\">This case requires us to decide whether the filing of a criminal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>complaint tolls the statute of limitations set forth in G. L. c. 277, \u00a7 63 (\u00a7 63), which states that \u201c,[a]n indictment for [armed robbery under G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 17,] . . . may be found and filed within [ten] years after the date of commission of such offense.\u201d We conclude that \u00a7 63 requires the filing of an indictment within the ten-year limitations period for armed robbery, G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 17, and that the filing of a complaint within the limitations period, and the return of an indictment outside that period, does not constitute timely commencement of the criminal proceeding. We therefore affirm the order dismissing the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-5\"><em>Background and prior proceedings. </em>We summarize background information that is reflected in the briefs of both parties.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On January 20, 2000, a man entered the Randolph Savings Bank in Stoughton, wearing a winter hat, a scarf that covered his face, and sunglasses. The man passed to a teller a note that \u201crequested]\u201d money and claimed the man had a weapon. After the teller handed the man some money, the man left the bank. A civilian witness took note of the registration number of the vehicle in which the man drove away. Stoughton police later located an automobile with that registration number in another town. Inside the vehicle, they found a winter hat. Police held the hat in storage until November, 2007, when they requested that it be tested for the presence of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA). On January 16, 2010, the results of the DNA testing were sent to the Stoughton police. Based on the test results, the DNA collected from the hat was determined to be a match for the DNA of the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-6\">After DNA testing linked the hat to the defendant, and inferentially to the armed robbery, the Commonwealth sought a criminal complaint in the District Court.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> A complaint issued in the District Court on January 19, 2010, charging the defendant with the January 20, 2000, armed robbery. On May 12, 2010, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>more than four months after the ten-year anniversary of the date on which the bank robbery occurred, a grand jury returned an indictment charging the defendant with the armed robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">The defendant filed a motion to dismiss in the Superior Court on the ground that the ten-year statute of limitations for armed robbery, G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 17, had expired before the indictment was returned by the grand jury. The Commonwealth agreed that the statute of limitations had expired before the indictment was returned, but argued that, by the filing of the complaint on January 19, 2010, the statute of limitations was tolled. The judge concluded that the statute of limitations required an indictment to be issued and filed within ten years from the date of the offense, and ordered the case dismissed with prejudice. The Commonwealth appealed, and we allowed the Commonwealth\u2019s application for direct appellate review.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-6\"><em>Discussion. </em>\u201cWe review a question of statutory interpretation de novo, without deference to the motion judge\u2019s conclusion.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>George W. Prescott Publ. Co., </em>463 Mass. 258, 264 n.9 (2012). We focus first on the language of the statute, which provides \u201cthe primary source of insight into the intent of the Legislature.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Millican, </em>449 Mass. 298, 300 (2007). As a general rule, \u201cwe do not look to extrinsic sources to vary the plain meaning of a clear, unambiguous statute unless a literal construction would yield an absurd or unworkable result.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 300-301.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-7\">1. <em>General Laws c. 277, \u00a7 </em>63.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> As noted, the statute of limitations applicable to armed robbery states that \u201c[a]n indictment for [armed robbery] . . . may be found and filed within [ten] years after the date of commission of such offense.\u201d G. L. c. 277, \u00a7 63.* *3<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Based on a literal reading, this provision requires that an indictment be returned by the grand jury to the Superior Court within the ten-year limitations period. See <em>Commonwealth </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>v. Dixon, 458 Mass. 446, 454-455 (2010) (\u201cThe plain language of the statute creates an elementary legal formula: once an indictment has been \u2018found and filed\u2019 within the statutory period . . . , the statute of limitations is tolled\u201d). On this reading, the filing of a complaint would not toll the statute of limitations for armed robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-5\">Other statutes of limitations set forth in \u00a7 63 support a reading of the text to mean that, as to specified offenses, the filing of a complaint will toll a limitations period only when the statute so provides. The second sentence of \u00a7 63 states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-6\">\u201cAn <em>indictment or complaint </em>for an offense set forth in section 13B, 13BV2, 13B<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>/4, 13F, 13L, 22A, 22B, 22C, 23, 23A, 23B, 24B or subsection <em>(b) </em>of section 50 of chapter 265, for conspiracy to commit any of these offenses, as an accessory thereto, or any [one] or more of them may be found and filed at any time after the date of the commission of such offense; but any <em>indictment or complaint </em>found and filed more than [twenty-seven] years after the date of commission of such offense shall be supported by independent evidence that corroborates the victim\u2019s allegation\u201d (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b296-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>\u201c[W]here the Legislature has employed specific language in one paragraph, but not in another, the language should not be implied where it is not present.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Galvin, </em>388 Mass. 326, 330 (1983), quoting <em>Beeler </em>v. <em>Downey, </em>387 Mass. 609, 616 (1982).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b296-5\">Here, the Legislature has made specific reference to \u201cindictment\u201d in some provisions of \u00a7 63, in contrast to its use of \u201cindictment or complaint\u201d in the second sentence of that section. The reference to both indictment and complaint comports with the type of offenses listed in the provision to which the statute of limitations applies. Some of the offenses referred to in this sentence can be tried on a complaint and disposed of in the District Court.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Others must be tried on an indictment and disposed of in the Superior Court,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> even if the crime is first charged by a complaint issued in the District Court, unless the defendant has waived the right to be proceeded against by indictment under G. L. c. 263, \u00a7 4A.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> By comparison, the first, fourth, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>fifth sentences of \u00a7 63, setting forth the statutes of limitations applicable to certain other enumerated offenses, use only the term \u201cindictment.\u201d See note 4, <em>supra. </em>Each of the offenses listed in those sentences must, due to the nature of the offense, be tried and disposed of in the Superior Court after a grand jury have returned an indictment, unless the defendant has waived the right to be proceeded against by indictment.* ***<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b297-5\">Read in this fashion, \u00a7 63 is internally consistent and supports an interpretation that requires the timely filing of an indictment, not a complaint, to toll the statute of limitations when the offense charged is armed robbery under G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 17. See <em>Wheatley </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Insurers Insolvency Fund, </em>456 Mass. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>594, 601 (2010) (statutes must be read as whole to produce internal consistency). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Williamson, </em>462 Mass. 676, 681 (2012), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Galvin, supra </em>at 328 (\u201cWhen the meaning of any particular section or clause of a statute is questioned, it is proper... to look into the other parts of the statute\u201d). Moreover, were we to interpret \u201cindictment\u201d as implicitly incorporating \u201ccomplaint\u201d in the first, fourth, and fifth sentences of \u00a7 63, the two explicit references to \u201ccomplaint\u201d in the second sentence would be rendered impermissibly superfluous. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Millican, </em>449 Mass. 298, 300 (2007), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Woods Hole, Martha\u2019s Vineyard &amp; Nantucket S.S. Auth., </em>352 Mass. 617, 618 (1967) (\u201cNone of the words of a statute is to be regarded as superfluous\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b298-5\">Our interpretation of \u00a7 63 is informed by our recognition that an indictment and a complaint are the products of two distinct procedures, and are not interchangeable labels for the commencement of a criminal proceeding. \u201cAn indictment is found when voted on favorably by twelve or more grand jurors, and filed when returned to a judge in open court.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dixon, supra </em>at 455, citing Mass. R. Crim. P 5 (e), as appearing in 442 Mass. 1505 (2004). See <em>Charles C. </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>415 Mass. 58, 65 (1993) (grand jury return indictments to Superior Court). Before an indictment may be returned, \u201cat the very least the grand jury must hear sufficient evidence to establish the identity of the accused . . . and probable cause to arrest him.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McCarthy, </em>385 Mass. 160, 163 (1982), and cases cited. Indictment by a grand jury is thus an important component in the prosecution of serious crimes, one which we have described \u201cas a bulwark of individual liberty and a fundamental protection against despotism and persecution.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Wilcox, </em>437 Mass. 33, 34 (2002), quoting <em>WBZ-TV4 </em>v. <em>District Attorney for the Suffolk Dist., </em>408 Mass. 595, 599-600 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b298-7\">The issuance of a criminal complaint, by contrast, does not involve presentation to the grand jury. Instead, a judicial officer may issue a complaint on the basis of any person\u2019s sworn statement, so long as there is \u201cprobable cause to believe that the person against whom the complaint is sought committed an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>offense.\u201d Mass. R. Crim. P. 3 (g), as appearing in 442 Mass. 1502 (2004). A judge need not be involved in this process; clerks-magistrate can issue criminal complaints. See G. L. c. 218, \u00a7 33; Dist./Mun. Cts. R. Crim. P. 2 (LexisNexis 2012-2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b299-5\">In light of these distinctions, and employing familiar canons of statutory interpretation, where the Legislature has specifically provided that an indictment must be found and filed for purposes of framing the time within which a specified criminal charge must be brought, the filing of a complaint will not toll a statute of limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-6\">That said, we note that the sixth sentence of \u00a7 63, which provides a six-year statute of limitations \u201cfor any other crime,\u201d does not use the word \u201ccomplaint.\u201d See G. L. c. 277, \u00a7 63 (\u201cAn indictment for any other crime shall be found and filed within [six] years after such crime has been committed\u201d). The Appeals Court, in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Northern Telecom, Inc., </em>25 Mass. App. Ct. 255, 257 (1988), concluded that a complaint charging an offense \u201cfor which no other statute of limitations is prescribed\u201d could be brought under this provision, and would toll the six-year statute of limitations.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b299-7\">Unlike every other provision within \u00a7 63, which identifies the specific offenses to which a statute of limitations is applicable, the sixth sentence does not list offenses to which it applies because it is intended as a catch-all provision. We therefore agree that the catch-all provision may sensibly be read to apply to complaints as well as to indictments. See <em>Champigny </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>422 Mass. 249, 251 (1996), quoting <em>Lehan </em>v. <em>North Main St. Garage, Inc., </em>312 Mass. 547, 550 (1942) (\u201cIf a liberal, even if not literally exact, interpretation of certain words is necessary to accomplish the purpose indicated by the words as a whole, such interpretation is to be adopted rather than one which will defeat that purpose\u201d). To conclude otherwise would produce the absurd result of providing for no statute of limitations for any offense as to which the District Court has concur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>rent jurisdiction.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> \u201cA literal construction of statutory language will not be adopted when such a construction will lead to an absurd and unreasonable conclusion, and the language to be construed \u2018is fairly susceptible to a construction that would lead to a logical and sensible result.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>George, </em>430 Mass. 276, 280 (1999), quoting <em>Lexington </em>v. <em>Bedford, </em>378 Mass. 562, 570 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b300-5\">2. <em>Effect of G. L. c. 277, \u00a7 79. </em>The Commonwealth urges that a different interpretation of \u00a7 63 is required when that statute is considered in connection with G. L. c. 277, \u00a7 79 (\u00a7 79). Section 79 states: \u201cThe provisions of this chapter, and the forms hereto annexed, shall apply as well to complaints as to indictments . . . .\u201d The Commonwealth argues that \u00a7 79 injects ambiguity into the otherwise plain text of \u00a7 63, because \u00a7 79 may be read to require the substitution of \u201ccomplaint\u201d for \u201cindictment\u201d throughout \u00a7 63, whenever appropriate. Cf. 2A N.J. Singer &amp; J.D. Shambie Singer, Statutes and Statutory Construction \u00a7 46:4, at 188-189 (7th ed. 2007) (\u201cEven when a statute appears unambiguous on its face it can be rendered ambiguous by its interaction with and its relation to other statutes\u201d). Indeed, the Commonwealth argues that such an interpretation is the only means by which to avoid the absurd result that most misdemeanors would not be subject to any statute of limitations if the word \u201ccomplaint\u201d could not be substituted for the word \u201cindictment,\u201d because, as noted, the catch-all six-year statute of limitations set forth in \u00a7 63 refers only to \u201cindictment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b300-6\">We are satisfied that our reading of \u00a7 63, and our approach to avoiding the absurd result noted by the Commonwealth, conforms with the Legislature\u2019s intent as expressed in the plain language of the first five sentences of \u00a7 63. See <em>Champigny </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number><em>Commonwealth, supra. </em>We do not agree that the word \u201ccomplaint\u201d may be substituted for the word \u201cindictment\u201d whenever that word appears in G. L. c. <em>277.</em><footnotemark><em>11</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Although we recognize that some tension exists between the language of \u00a7 79 and that of \u00a7 63, any \u201cuncertainty that results from a literal reading of the statute is to be resolved in favor of the defendant.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Clinton, </em>374 Mass. 719, 721 (1978). See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Habig, </em>390 U.S. 222, 227 (1968), quoting <em>United States </em>v. <em>Scharton, </em>285 U.S. 518, 522 (1932) (criminal statutes of limitations are \u201cliberally interpreted in favor of repose\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b301-5\">\u201cCriminal statutes are to be construed strictly against the Commonwealth and in favor of the defendant, under the premise that \u2018[n]o one may be required at peril of life, liberty or property to speculate as to the meaning of penal statutes.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McLaughlin, </em>431 Mass. 241, 250 (2000), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ruiz, </em>426 Mass. 391, 394 (1998).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Based on the language of \u00a7 63, and construing the statute of limitations <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>for armed robbery in favor of repose, we conclude that \u00a7 63 requires the filing of an indictment to toll the statute of limitations as to that offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-4\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b293-7\">According to the defendant\u2019s memorandum in support of his motion to dismiss, this information is contained in the police report attached to the criminal complaint.

The case cites <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Northern Telecom, Inc., </em>25 Mass. App. Ct. 255, 257 (1988), for the proposition that the reference to an indictment in the statute \u201cequally applies to the issuance of a criminal complaint.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b300-7\">The catch-all statute of limitations, first enacted in 1836, has not been substantially altered since that date. See Rev. St. 1836, c. 136, \u00a7 16 (\u201cAn indictment for the crime of murder may be found at any period, after the death of the person alleged to have been murdered; all other indictments shall be found and filed within six years after the commission of the offence. . .\u201d). Based on the notes of the commissioners appointed to revise the statutes at that time, it appears that this provision was intended to be \u201ca limitation of all criminal prosecutions, except for the crime of murder.\u201d 4 Report of the Commissioners Appointed to Revise the General Statutes of the Commonwealth 53 (1834).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b301-6\">In 2006, when the Legislature rewrote \u00a7 63 in its entirety, see St. 2006, c. 303, \u00a7 9, it was against the backdrop of G. L. c. 277, \u00a7 79. See G. L. c. 277, \u00a7 79, as amended through St. 1980, c. 459, \u00a7 9. Even though G. L. c. 277, \u00a7 79, was in force before the 2006 revisions to \u00a7 63, the Legislature used the phrase \u201cindictment or complaint\u201d in the statute of limitations covering crimes within the concurrent jurisdiction of the District Court, and \u201cindictment\u201d in the statutes of limitations covering only crimes within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Superior Court. We assume that the Legislature was aware of existing statutes when it enacted \u00a7 63, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Callahan, </em>440 Mass. 436, 440-441 (2003), and that it therefore did not intend to alter its careful delineations between complaint and indictment by operation of G. L. c. 277, \u00a7 79.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b301-7\">As Justice Black said, writing for the majority in <em>Toussie </em>v. <em>United States, </em>397 U.S. 112, 114-115 (1970), quoting <em>United States </em>v. <em>Habig, </em>390 U.S. 222, 227 (1968):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b301-8\">\u201cThe purpose of a statute of limitations is to limit exposure to criminal prosecution to a certain fixed period of time following the occurrence of those acts the [Ljegislature has decided to punish by criminal sanctions.

Such a time limit may also have the salutary effect of encouraging law enforcement officials promptly to investigate suspected criminal activity.
