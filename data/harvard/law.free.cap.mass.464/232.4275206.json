The issue presented by the reported questions is whether \u00a7 131L <em>(a) </em>is unconstitutional in light of the United States Supreme Court\u2019s decisions in <em>District of Columbia </em>v. <em>Heller, </em>554 U.S. 570, 635 (2008) <em>(Heller), </em>which held that the Second Amendment to the United States Constitu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>tion guarantees an individual the right to keep and bear arms for self-defense in the home, and <em>McDonald </em>v. <em>Chicago, </em>130 S. Ct. 3020, 3036, 3050 (2010) <em>(McDonald), </em>which incorporated the guarantees of the Second Amendment into the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, making the Second Amendment applicable to the States. We conclude that, where \u00a7 131L <em>{a) </em>allows the owner of a firearm to carry or otherwise keep the firearm under the owner\u2019s immediate control within the home, and where the storage requirements are reasonably designed to prevent persons who are not licensed to possess or carry a firearm, including felons, the mentally ill, and children, from gaining illegal access to a firearm, \u00a7 131L (a) falls outside the scope of the right to bear arms protected by the Second Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-5\"><em>Background. </em>The parties stipulated to the following facts, which are contained in a stipulation and a police report dated October 19, 2008.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The defendant owned a Smith &amp; Wesson forty caliber semiautomatic handgun, which he kept loaded and unlocked in a bedroom side table drawer on the second floor of his home. The defendant had a valid license to carry a firearm in Massachusetts, issued by the Springfield police department. On October 19, at approximately 5:42 p.m., officers were dispatched to the defendant\u2019s house in response to a telephone call he made about a domestic disturbance. When the police arrived, the defendant reported that he had an argument with his female \u201croommate\u201d over a ten-dollar loan, and that his roommate became angry, went into the defendant\u2019s bedroom, retrieved his loaded handgun from the unlocked drawer, left the house, threw the firearm into the bushes beside the neighboring house, and locked the defendant out of the house when he left to retrieve the weapon. The officers secured the handgun, which was loaded with ten rounds, one in the chamber and the remainder in the magazine. The defendant told police that the firearm was loaded that way when the roommate took it.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-6\">The defendant was charged in a criminal complaint issued on November 18, 2008, in the Springfield Division of the District Court Department with a violation of \u00a7 131L <em>(a). </em>The defend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>ant moved to dismiss the complaint, claiming the statute is unconstitutional. Recognizing that the issues raised in the motion were \u201cof immense constitutional depth and seriousness,\u201d the motion judge reported two questions to the Appeals Court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b252-5\">\u201c1. Do the holdings in <em>Heller </em>and <em>McDonald, </em>under the circumstances of this motion, so conflict with the requirements of G. L. c. 140, \u00a7 131L <em>(a), </em>as to render the Massachusetts statute constitutionally unenforceable?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b252-6\">\u201c2. More broadly but quite specifically, with respect to rights protected by the Second Amendment. . . does Massachusetts still maintain authority to regulate for the protection of its citizens\u2019 health, safety and welfare to the extent that [\u00a7] 131L (a) could be enforced?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b252-7\">See Mass. R. Crim. R 34, as amended, 442 Mass. 1501 (2004). We transferred the case to this court on our own motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-8\"><em>Discussion. </em>In <em>Heller, </em>the United States Supreme Court held that the Second Amendment to the United States Constitution \u201cprotects the right to possess a handgun in the home for the purpose of self-defense.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>McDonald, supra </em>at 3050. <em>Heller, supra </em>at 635. <em>Heller </em>struck down the District of Columbia\u2019s \u201cban on handgun possession in the home\u201d and its \u201cprohibition against rendering any lawful firearm in the home operable for the purpose of immediate self-defense.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>The Court declared that individual self-defense is the <em>\u201ccentral </em>component\u201d of the Second Amendment right and the Second Amendment \u201csurely elevates above all other interests the right of law-abiding, responsible citizens to use arms in defense of hearth and home\u201d (emphasis <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>in original). <em>Id. </em>at 599, 635. Since <em>Heller, </em>\u201c[c]ourts have consistently recognized that <em>Heller </em>established that the possession of operative firearms for use in defense of the home constitutes the \u2018core\u2019 of the Second Amendment.\u201d <em>Hightower </em>v. <em>Boston, 693 </em>F.3d 61, 72 (1st Cir. 2012), citing <em>United States </em>v. <em>Booker, </em>644 F.3d 12, 25 n.17 (1st Cir. 2011), cert, denied, 132 S. Ct. 1538 (2012); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Greeno, 619 </em>F.3d 510, 517 (6th Cir.), cert, denied, 133 S. Ct. 375 (2012); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Staten, 666 </em>F.3d 154, 158 (4th Cir. 2011), cert, denied, 132 S. Ct. 1937 (2012); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Barton, 633 </em>F.3d 168, 170 (3d Cir. 2011); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Reese, </em>627 F.3d 792, 800 (10th Cir. 2010), cert, denied, 131 S. Ct. 2476 (2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b253-5\">The Court in <em>Heller </em>acknowledged that its own precedents dictated that \u201cthe Second Amendment does not by its own force apply to anyone other than the Federal Government.\u201d <em>Heller, supra </em>at 619. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Cruikshank, 92 </em>U.S. 542, 553 (1875) (Cruikshank). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Runyan, </em>456 Mass. 230, 233-234 (2010) <em>(Runyan). </em>Because <em>Heller </em>dealt with a District of Columbia ordinance, the Court did not reach the question whether to incorporate the newly confirmed Second Amendment right into the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s due process clause. <em>Heller, supra </em>at 620 n.23.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-6\">After the <em>Heller </em>decision, but before the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>McDonald, </em>we upheld the constitutionality of \u00a7 131L (a).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>Runyan, supra </em>at 237. We distinguished \u00a7 131L <em>(a) </em>from the District of Columbia regulation invalidated in <em>Heller </em>because \u00a7 131L <em>(a) </em>\u201cdoes not require that firearms in the home be rendered and kept inoperable at all times\u201d and \u201cdoes not make it impossible for those persons licensed to possess firearms to rely on them for lawful self-defense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 236-237. However, we deferred to the Supreme Court\u2019s unwillingness in <em>Heller </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>to overturn <em>Cruikshank. Id. </em>at 233-234. We determined that Run-yan\u2019s Second Amendment challenge must fail because \u2018 \u2018the Second Amendment is not incorporated under the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s guarantee of substantive due process and therefore does not apply to the States.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 235. We did not decide whether Runyan\u2019s alleged violation of \u00a7 131L (a) could survive a motion to dismiss if the Second Amendment were made applicable to the States through incorporation under the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s due process clause. <em>Id. </em>at 237 n.7.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-10\">In <em>McDonald, </em>five members of the Court determined that the individual right to keep and bear arms in self-defense is protected from infringement by the States. Four members of the Court agreed that \u201cthe Framers and ratifiers of the Fourteenth Amendment counted the right to keep and bear arms among those fundamental rights necessary to our system of ordered liberty\u201d and concluded that \u201cthe Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment incorporates the Second Amendment right recognized in Heller.\u201d <em>McDonald, supra </em>at 3042, 3050 (plurality opinion). Justice Thomas, while agreeing with the plurality result that the Fourteenth Amendment makes the right to keep and bear arms fully applicable to the States, did not concur that a clause speaking only of \u201cprocess\u201d could guarantee a substantive right. <em>Id. </em>at 3058-3059 (Thomas, J., concurring in part and concurring in the judgment). Instead, Justice Thomas concluded that the right to keep and bear arms is a \u201cprivilege of American citizenship that applies to the States through the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s Privileges and Immunities Clause.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 3059 (Thomas, J., concurring in part and concurring in the judgment). Despite the absence of a majority as to the specific provision in the Fourteenth Amendment that makes the Second Amendment applicable to the States, it is clear from the <em>McDonald </em>decision that States cannot infringe on an individual\u2019s right to keep and bear arms in self-defense of the home.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Accordingly, we must now address the question left undecided in <em>Runyan: </em>whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>enforcement of \u00a7 131L <em>(a) </em>constitutes impermissible State infringement on an individual\u2019s right to keep and bear arms for self-defense in the home.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-5\">While holding that the Second Amendment provides an individual right to keep and bear arms in self-defense in the home, the Supreme Court in <em>Heller </em>made clear that the Second Amendment right is \u201cnot unlimited.\u2019\u2019 <em>Heller, supra </em>at 595. \u201cFrom Blackstone through the 19th-century cases, commentators and courts routinely explained that the right was not a right to keep and carry any weapon whatsoever in any manner whatsoever and for whatever purpose.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 626. See <em>McDonald, supra </em>at 3047. Accord <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gouse, </em>461 Mass. 787, 801 (2012). The Court declared:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b255-6\">\u201cAlthough we do not undertake an exhaustive historical analysis today of the full scope of the Second Amendment, nothing in our opinion should be taken to cast doubt on longstanding prohibitions on the possession of firearms by felons and the mentally ill, or laws forbidding the carrying of firearms in sensitive places such as schools and government buildings, or laws imposing conditions and qualifications on the commercial sale of arms.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b255-7\"><em>Heller, supra </em>at 626-627. In a footnote, the Court added, \u201cWe identify these presumptively lawful regulatory measures only as examples; our list does not purport to be exhaustive.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 627 n.26.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-8\">The Supreme Court made clear that a law that infringes the right to bear arms in self-defense within the scope of the Second Amendment is subject to some level of heightened scrutiny, rejecting the notion that rational basis scrutiny would suffice. <em>Id. </em>at 628 n.27 (\u201cIf all that was required to overcome the right to keep and bear arms was a rational basis, the Second Amendment would be redundant with the separate constitutional prohibitions on irrational laws, and would have no effect\u201d). But it did not identify precisely what level of heightened scrutiny is appropriate because it concluded that the District of Columbia\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>outright ban on handguns would fail under any level of scrutiny. <em>Id. </em>at 628-629. See <em>Ezell </em>v. <em>Chicago, </em>651 F.3d 684, 701 (7th Cir. 2011) <em>(\u201cHeller\u2019s </em>reference to \u2018any standard of scrutiny\u2019 means any <em>heightened </em>standard of scrutiny\u201d [emphasis in original]). The Court rejected, however, Justice Breyer\u2019s proposal in his dissenting opinion that such laws be subject to an \u201c \u2018interest-balancing inquiry\u2019 that \u2018asks whether the statute burdens a protected interest in a way or to an extent that is out of proportion to the statute\u2019s salutary effects upon other important governmental interests.\u2019 \u201d <em>Heller, supra </em>at 634, quoting <em>id. </em>at 689-690 (Breyer, J., dissenting). In rejecting the interest-balancing test, the Court drew an analogy to First Amendment freedom of speech:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b256-5\">\u201cThe First Amendment contains the freedom-of-speech guarantee that the people ratified, which included exceptions for obscenity, libel, and disclosure of state secrets, but not for the expression of extremely unpopular and wrong-headed views. The Second Amendment is no different. Like the First, it is the very <em>product </em>of an interest balancing by the people . . .\u201d (emphasis in original).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b256-6\"><em>Heller, supra </em>at 635.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-7\">We appreciate that the \u201cfull significance of these pronouncements is far from self-evident.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Booker, </em>644 F.3d 12, 23 (1st Cir. 2011). But we discern meaning from the Supreme Court\u2019s willingness to characterize some long-standing limitations on the right to bear arms, such as the prohibition of the possession of firearms by felons and the mentally ill, and the regulation of the commercial sale of arms, as \u201cpresumptively lawful\u201d without subjecting these laws to heightened scrutiny, or identifying the level of heightened scrutiny that would apply. These laws could be presumptively lawful without such heightened scrutiny only if they fell outside the scope of the Second Amendment and therefore were not subject to heightened scrutiny. This conclusion is supported by the Supreme Court\u2019s analogy to the First Amendment right to freedom of speech, where it noted that obscenity, libel, and the disclosure of State secrets were excluded from the scope of the protection provided by this amendment through the \u201cinterest balancing\u201d of those <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>that enacted the right. <em>Heller, supra </em>at 634-635. The inference we draw from the Supreme Court\u2019s analysis is that the \u201cpresumptively lawful\u201d prohibitions and regulations do not burden conduct that falls within the scope of the Second Amendment and therefore are not subject to the heightened scrutiny required where protected conduct within the scope of the Second Amendment is infringed. See <em>Ezell </em>v. <em>Chicago, supra </em>at 702, quoting <em>United States </em>v. <em>Stevens, </em>130 S. Ct. 1577, 1584 1585 (2010) (\u201cThe Supreme Court\u2019s free-speech jurisprudence contains a parallel for this kind of threshold \u2018scope\u2019 inquiry. The Court has long recognized that certain \u2018well-defined and narrowly limited classes of speech\u2019 e.g., obscenity, defamation, fraud, incitement are categorically \u2018outside the reach\u2019 of the First Amendment\u201d). See generally Volokh, Implementing the Right to Keep and Bear Arms for Self-Defense: An Analytical Framework and a Research Agenda, 56 UCLA L. Rev. 1443, 1449-1453 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b257-5\">The inference we draw from <em>Heller </em>is shared by many of the circuit courts of the United States Court of Appeals that have concluded that \u201c \u2018longstanding\u2019 regulations\u201d are \u201cpresumed not to burden conduct within the scope of the Second Amendment.\u201d <em>Heller </em>v. <em>District of Columbia, </em>670 F.3d 1244, 1253 (D.C. Cir. 2011). See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Marzzarella, </em>614 F.3d 85, 91 (3d Cir. 2010), cert, denied, 131 S. Ct. 958 (2011) (\u201clongstanding limitations are exceptions to the right to bear arms\u201d). See also <em>United States </em>v. <em>Booker, supra </em>at 22-23; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Chester, </em>628 F.3d 673, 679-680 (4th Cir. 2010); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Skoien, </em>614 F.3d 638, 640 (7th Cir. 2010) (en banc), cert, denied, 131 S. Ct. 1674 (2011); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Rene E., </em>583 F.3d 8, 12 (1st Cir. 2009), cert, denied, 558 U.S. 1131 (2010).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b257-6\">The \u201cpresumptively lawful\u201d prohibitions and regulations that burden conduct outside the scope of the Second Amendment and therefore are not subject to heightened scmtiny under the Second Amendment are not limited to those that existed at the time of ratification in 1791. As the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b258-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>\u201cThe felony firearm disqualification, which numbers among <em>Heller\u2019s </em>list of \u2018presumptively lawful\u2019 measures, presents a case in point. Though there may be some historical predicates for restricting the gun rights of those who have been convicted of a crime ... the modem federal felony firearm disqualification law, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1), is firmly rooted in the twentieth century and likely bears little resemblance to laws in effect at the time the Second Amendment was ratified\u201d (citations and footnote omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b258-5\"><em>United States </em>v. <em>Booker, supra </em>at 23-24. See <em>National Rifle Ass\u2019n of Am. </em>v. <em>Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms &amp; Explosives, </em>700 F.3d 185, 196 (5th Cir. 2012) <em>(\u201cHeller </em>demonstrates that a regulation can be deemed \u2018longstanding\u2019 even if it cannot boast a precise founding-era analogue\u201d); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Skoien, supra </em>at 641 (\u201cexclusions need not mirror limits that were on the books in 1791\u201d). Nonetheless, laws prohibiting certain classes of people from gaining access to firearms predate the enactment of the Second Amendment. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Rene E., supra </em>at 15-16. For example, in the early days of the American Revolution, Massachusetts and Pennsylvania passed acts that disarmed anyone who refused to swear an oath of allegiance to the new nation. See St. 1776, c. 7; 1778 Pa. Laws c. 51, \u00a7\u00a7 5, 6. In 1787, Massachusetts again limited access to firearms, this time by requiring individuals who participated in Shays\u2019 Rebellion to relinquish their arms for three years in order to obtain a pardon. See St. 1787, c. 6. See also Kates, Second Amendment Limitations and Criminological Considerations, 60 Hastings L.J. 1339, 1360 (2009) (\u201cfrom time immemorial, various jurisdictions recognizing a right to arms have nevertheless taken the step of forbidding suspect groups from having arms\u201d); Cornell, \u201cDon\u2019t Know Much About History\u201d: The Current Crisis in Second Amendment Scholarship, 29 N. Ky. L. Rev. 657, 679 (2002) (during \u201cFounding era,\u201d right to bear arms understood as \u201cnot something that all persons could claim, but was limited to those members of the polity who were deemed capable of exercising it in a virtuous manner\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b258-6\">We have consistently held, without applying any level of heightened scrutiny, that the decisions in <em>Heller </em>and <em>McDonald </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>did not invalidate laws that require a person to have a firearm identification card to possess a firearm in one\u2019s home or place of business, and to have a license to carry in order to possess a firearm elsewhere. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>461 Mass. 44, 58 (2011); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Loadholt, </em>460 Mass. 723, 726 (2011); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Powell, </em>459 Mass. 572, 589-590 (2011). Accord <em>People </em>v. <em>Perkins, </em>62 A.D.3d 1160, 1161 (N.Y. 2009) (New York firearm licensing regulations do not violate Second Amendment). We are not alone. For example, in <em>Heller </em>v. <em>District of Columbia, supra </em>at 1254, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit held that \u201cthe basic requirement to register a handgun is longstanding in American law\u201d and is presumptively lawful. Similarly, in <em>United States </em>v. <em>Rene E., supra </em>at 15, the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit upheld a Federal statute prohibiting juveniles from possessing handguns because it was part of a \u201clongstanding practice of prohibiting certain classes of individuals from possessing firearms \u2014 those whose possession poses a particular danger to the public.\u201d Contrast <em>Heller </em>v. <em>District of Columbia, supra </em>at 1255-1256 (applying heightened scrutiny to \u201cnovel\u201d registration requirements); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Chester, </em>628 F.3d 673, 681, 682 (4th Cir. 2010) (intermediate scrutiny appropriate because \u201cwe are certainly not able to say that the Second Amendment, as historically understood, did not apply to persons convicted of domestic violence misdemeanors\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b259-5\">Nor did the decisions in <em>Heller </em>and <em>McDonald </em>invalidate laws that prevent the sale of firearms to persons who have no firearms identification card and therefore are not authorized to possess a firearm. The Supreme Court in <em>Heller </em>specifically recognized that \u201claws imposing conditions and qualifications on the commercial sale of arms\u201d are among the \u201cpresumptively lawful regulatory measures.\u201d <em>Heller, supra </em>at 626-627 &amp; n.26. Laws that prohibit the sale of firearms to unauthorized users are similar in purpose to laws, such as \u00a7 131L (a), that require those authorized to possess a firearm, when they are not carrying or otherwise immediately controlling the firearm, to secure it to ensure that those who are not authorized to possess a firearm do not gain access to their firearm. Both types of laws are designed to keep firearms out of the hands of those not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>authorized by law to possess a firearm, including but not limited to felons, the mentally ill, and children. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Reyes, post </em>245, 250-251 &amp; n.5 (2012); <em>Jupin </em>v. <em>Kask, </em>447 Mass. 141, 154 (2006) (\u00a7 131L [o] \u201cis illustrative of the societal concern with weapons reaching the hands of unauthorized users\u201d); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Patterson, </em>79 Mass. App. Ct. 316, 319 (2011) (purpose of \u00a7 131L [a] is \u201cto guard against the use of firearms by unauthorized, incompetent, or irresponsible persons\u201d). Without \u00a7 131L (a) or a comparable statute, those prohibited from purchasing a firearm may nonetheless gain ready access to an unsecured firearm that is not under the immediate control of the owner.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b260-5\">Where a firearm is stored in the home, however, restrictions on the sale or storage of firearms must be consistent with the Second Amendment right of self-defense in the home. The provision of the District of Columbia Code at issue in <em>Heller, </em>D.C. Code \u00a7 7-2507.02 (2008), was not consistent with the right of self-defense in the home. As we noted in <em>Runyan, supra </em>at 236:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b260-6\">\u201cUnder this provision, a person registered to keep a firearm (apart from law enforcement personnel) was prohibited in any circumstance from carrying or keeping a loaded firearm in his or her home. The ordinance prohibited a registered gun owner from keeping even an unloaded firearm in his or her home unless it was disassembled or rendered inoperable by a trigger lock or similar device.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b260-7\">In contrast, as we also noted, <em>id:.</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b260-8\">\u201cUnder [G. L. c. 140, \u00a7 131L (a)], an individual with a valid firearms identification card issued under G. L. c. 140, \u00a7 129C, is not obliged to secure or render inoperable a firearm while the individual carries it or while it remains otherwise under the individual\u2019s control. A gun owner may therefore carry or keep a loaded firearm under his or her control in his or her home without securing it with a trig<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>ger lock or comparable safety device. The gun owner\u2019s obligation to secure the firearm in accordance with the statute arises only when the firearm is stored or otherwise outside the owner\u2019s immediate control.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b261-5\">Therefore, unlike the provision declared unconstitutional in Heller, \u00a7 131L (a) is consistent with the right of self-defense in the home because it does not interfere with the ability of a licensed gun owner to carry or keep a loaded firearm under his immediate control for self-defense. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Reyes, supra </em>at 257; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Patterson, supra </em>at 318 (\u201cstatute\u2019s storage requirement placed no meaningful restraint on the defendant\u2019s ability to use the gun in lawful self-defense if for no other reason than that he himself placed it where it could not be quickly reached\u201d); Jackson vs. City &amp; County of San Francisco, U.S. Dist. Ct., No. C 09-2143 RS, slip op. at 4 (N.D. Cal. Aug. 17, 2012), quoting <em>Heller, supra </em>at 576 (regulation that allows residents to carry unsecured firearms freely in their homes, but requires them to apply trigger locks or to store handguns in locked containers when the guns are not under direct, personal control, \u201cpermits individuals the very right the plaintiff in <em>Heller </em>was seeking: \u2018to render a firearm operable and carry it about his home in that condition\u2019 \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b261-6\">Even though the obligation to secure a firearm in \u00a7 131L (a) applies only where the gun owner chooses not to carry a firearm or keep it under his immediate control, the defendant suggests that the brief period of delay needed to unlock a secure storage container or trigger lock suffices to render this requirement in violation of the Second Amendment\u2019s right to self-defense in one\u2019s home. We disagree. The Supreme Court in <em>Heller </em>specifically noted that its analysis did not \u201csuggest the invalidity of laws regulating the storage of firearms to prevent accidents.\u201d <em>Heller, supra </em>at 632. The prevention of accidents by those not authorized to use firearms, as well as the prevention of crimes of violence and suicide by those not authorized to possess firearms, are among the evils that \u00a7 131L <em>(a) </em>is intended to prevent. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Reyes, supra </em>at 250-251 &amp; n.6. Any law regulating the storage of firearms will delay to some degree the ability of a firearm owner to retrieve and fire the firearm in self-defense. If such a brief period of delay were sufficient to render the law unconstitutional, the Supreme Court in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number><em>Heller </em>would not have declared that its analysis did not suggest the invalidity of firearm storage laws.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b262-5\">We hold that, because \u00a7 131L (a) is consistent with the right to bear arms in self-defense in one\u2019s home and is designed to prevent those who are not licensed to possess or carry firearms from gaining access to firearms, it falls outside the scope of the Second Amendment. As a result, it is subject only to rational basis analysis, which it easily survives. Therefore, we conclude that \u00a7 131L <em>(a) </em>is constitutional under the Supreme Court\u2019s holdings and analysis in <em>Heller </em>and <em>McDonald, </em>and that Massachusetts may enforce \u00a7 131L <em>(a) </em>to protect the health, safety, and welfare of its citizens.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b262-6\"><em>Conclusion. </em>We answer, \u201cNo,\u201d to the first reported question, and, \u201cYes,\u201d to the second reported question.

At that time, laws were in effect requiring that gunpowder be stored separately from firearms, which meant that a law-abiding homeowner acting in self-defense would need time to load and fire a musket or flintlock pistol. See <em>[District of Columbia </em>v. <em>Heller, </em>554 U.S. 570, 684-686 (2008)] (Breyer, J., dissenting). A skilled soldier of that time using specially prepared cartridges required a minimum of fifteen to twenty seconds to load and fire a musket; a less skilled soldier could fire no more quickly than once per minute. Hicks, United States Military Shoulder Arms, 1795-1935, 1 Am. Military Hist. Found. 23, 30-31 (1937).
