We conclude, pursuant to art. 11 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights, that (1) the speedy trial clock starts when a Massachusetts criminal complaint issues, and (2) the speedy trial clock \u201cresumes\u201d when the Commonwealth reinstates charges following dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-6\">After the Appeals Court concluded that the delay in bringing the defendant to trial did not violate Mass. R. Crim. R 36, 378 Mass. 909 (1979), and affirmed the defendant\u2019s rape conviction, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Butler, </em>68 Mass. App. Ct. 658, 661, 667 (2007) <em>(.Butler I), </em>the defendant filed a motion for a new trial alleging that appellate counsel<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> was ineffective for failing to argue to the Appeals Court that the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss on speedy trial grounds should have been allowed under the speedy trial provisions of the State or Federal Constitution.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> See <em>id. </em>at 659, n. 2. The motion for a new trial was denied, and the Appeals Court affirmed.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Butler, </em>79 Mass. App. Ct. 751, 759 (2011) <em>(Butler II). </em>We granted the defendant\u2019s application for further appellate review. Like the Appeals Court, we conclude that the defendant was not denied <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number>the effective assistance of counsel. Therefore, we affirm the order denying the motion for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-5\">1. <em>Facts. </em>We summarize the relevant facts as found by the motion judge, supplemented by uncontested facts set forth in <em>Butler I, supra </em>at 659-661.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-6\">On September 16, 1991, a criminal complaint and an arrest warrant issued from the Chelsea Division of the District Court Department against the defendant for rape in violation of G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 22 <em>{b), </em>and unarmed burglary in violation of G. L. c. 266, \u00a7 15, both alleged to have occurred three days earlier. On May 21, 1992, a warrant for the defendant\u2019s arrest for these crimes was lodged at the correctional institution where the defendant was serving a sentence on unrelated charges. It appears from the docket that court personnel in the District Court failed to enter details concerning the warrant in the warrant management system as required by G. L. c. 276, \u00a7 23A. In January, 1993, while still incarcerated on the unrelated charges, the defendant signed a form requesting a speedy trial on the 1991 complaint. Although the District Court received the defendant\u2019s request, the form was not docketed and no action was taken on the request. A department of correction \u201csummary/key issues\u201d report dated April 14, 1993, stated that rape and burglary charges against the defendant were outstanding; however, subsequent \u201csummary/key issues\u201d reports issued between 1994 and 1997, which the defendant signed, stated that the defendant had \u201cno outstanding legal issues.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b726-7\">The defendant completed his sentence on the unrelated charges and was released on June 21, 1997. Three days later, a second warrant for his arrest issued on the rape and burglary charges. The defendant was arrested and arraigned in District Court on the 1991 complaint on March 11, 1998. On April 10, 1998, however, the charges against him were dismissed without prejudice because the Commonwealth was unable to locate the rape victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-8\">The Commonwealth subsequently renewed contact with the victim and, on March 23, 1999, nearly one year following the dismissal of the charges, obtained aggravated rape and unarmed burglary indictments against the defendant. The defendant was arraigned in Superior Court on May 6, 1999. The defendant\u2019s trial began on May 5, 2003, where the issue was not whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"709\">*709</page-number>intercourse occurred (the fact of intercourse was established by deoxyribonucleic acid [DNA] evidence and conceded by the defendant), but whether, as the defendant claimed, the victim consented to sexual intercourse in exchange for drugs. A jury convicted the defendant of the lesser included offense of rape, and acquitted him of unarmed burglary.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-5\">2. <em>Standard of review. </em>Counsel\u2019s performance is ineffective if it falls \u201cmeasurably below that which might be expected from an ordinary fallible lawyer,\u201d and \u201clikely deprived the defendant of an otherwise available, substantial ground of defence.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Saferian, </em>366 Mass. 89, 96 (1974) <em>(Saferian). </em>\u201cA strategic or tactical decision by counsel will not be considered ineffective assistance unless the decision was \u2018manifestly unreasonable\u2019 when made.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>5Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Roderiques, </em>462 Mass. 415, 425-426 (2012), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Watson, </em>455 Mass. 246, 256 (2009). To determine whether either prong of the <em>Saferian </em>test is implicated here, we consider the merits of the defendant\u2019s claim that the delay in bringing him to trial violated his constitutional right to a speedy trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-6\">3. <em>Speedy trial analysis.</em><footnotemark><em>5</em></footnotemark><em> </em>a. <em>Threshold inquiry: \u201cpresumptive prejudice.\u201d </em>\u201cSimply to trigger a speedy trial analysis, an accused must allege that the interval between accusation and trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"710\">*710</page-number>has crossed the threshold dividing ordinary from \u2018presumptively prejudicial\u2019 delay.\u201d <em>Doggett </em>v. <em>United States, </em>505 U.S. 647, 651-652 (1992) <em>(Doggett), </em>citing <em>Barker </em>v. <em>Wingo, </em>407 U.S. 514, 530-531 (1972) <em>(Barker). </em>Once a defendant has established presumptive prejudice, courts apply the four-factor <em>Barker </em>test to evaluate whether the defendant\u2019s constitutional right to a speedy trial has, in fact, been violated. <em>Doggett, supra. </em>Further analysis of a speedy trial claim under <em>Barker </em>is necessary because \u201cpresumptive prejudice cannot alone carry a [speedy trial] claim,\u201d but is instead \u201cpart of the mix of relevant facts.\u201d <em>Doggett, supra </em>at 655-656.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-5\">Although the considerable delay leaves no doubt that a <em>Barker </em>inquiry is warranted, we take this opportunity to consider the precise length of delay in the present case. Thus, we address (1) when the defendant\u2019s speedy trial right attached, and (2) whether the time prior to the April, 1998, dismissal counts against the Commonwealth, to bring clarity to ambiguous points of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-6\">i. <em>Attachment. </em>It is well-established that indictment or arrest starts the speedy trial clock. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Marion, </em>404 U.S. 307,320 (1971) (\u201cit is either a formal indictment or information or else the actual restraints imposed by arrest and holding to answer a criminal charge that engage[s]\u201d right to speedy trial). What is less clear is whether a criminal complaint, a different type of accusatory pleading than that cited by the Supreme Court, similarly triggers a defendant\u2019s speedy trial right. See <em>Rashad </em>v. <em>Walsh, </em>300 F.3d 27, 35-36 (1st Cir. 2002), cert, denied 537 U.S. 1236 (2003). See generally Mass. R. Crim. P. 3 (g) (1), as appearing in 442 Mass. 1502 (2004) (complaint process). This ambiguity stems from the \u201cinterchangeable use of the terms \u2018indictment\u2019 and \u2018filing of charges.\u2019 \u201d <em>Rashad </em>v. <em>Walsh, supra </em>at 36, quoting <em>United States </em>v. <em>MacDonald, </em>456 U.S. 1, 6-7 (1972) <em>(MacDonald). </em>See <em>Doggett, supra </em>at 655 (\u201carrest, indictment, <em>or other official </em>accusation\u201d triggers right to speedy trial [emphasis supplied]); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Marion, supra </em>at 321 (\u201cInvocation of the speedy trial provision thus need not await indictment, information or <em>other formal charge\u201d </em>[emphasis supplied]). Given this ambiguity, courts have reached different <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"711\">*711</page-number>conclusions<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> concerning whether a criminal complaint constitutes a \u201cformal charge\u201d for the purposes of the attachment of a defendant\u2019s right to a speedy trial.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Therefore, it is not surprising that some of our appellate decisions have stated that a criminal complaint triggers the right to a speedy trial. Compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Malone, </em>65 Mass. App. Ct. 285, 288 (2005); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Willis, 21 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 963, 964 (1986), and cases cited; and <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Conant, 12 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 287, 289 (1981), and cases cited, with <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Look, </em>379 Mass. 893, 898, cert, denied 449 U.S. 827 (1980), citing <em>United States </em>v. <em>Marion, supra </em>at 320-321 (right to speedy trial attaches at indictment), and <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gove, </em>366 Mass. 351, 353-354, 361 (1974) (same). Indeed, here, the motion judge stated that \u201cthe issuance of a District Court complaint is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"712\">*712</page-number>ordinarily sufficient to trigger the defendant\u2019s right to a speedy trial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b730-5\">We conclude that a defendant\u2019s right to a speedy trial, at least under art. 11, attaches when a criminal complaint issues. Therefore, arrest, indictment, or a criminal complaint issued pursuant to Massachusetts law, whichever comes first, will start the speedy trial clock. Any cases to the contrary are no longer good law. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gove, supra. </em>The constitutional right to a speedy trial attaches because the subject of a criminal complaint is undoubtedly an \u201caccused,\u201d and is not merely in \u201cthe preaccusation period when a police investigation is ongoing.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gove, supra </em>at 357, citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>360 Mass. 498 (1971). A criminal complaint is a formal charging document in Massachusetts. See Mass. R. Crim. R 3 (a).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The fact that a complaint may be followed by an indictment, see Mass. R. Crim. R 3 (b), does not render a complaint any less of a formal accusation. Moreover, art. 11 does not distinguish between the types of cases (misdemeanor or felony; within the jurisdiction of the District or Superior Court) to which the right to a speedy trial attaches; it states that the right to a speedy trial applies to \u201c[ejvery subject of the [Cjommonwealth.\u201d See <em>Jacobson </em>v. <em>Winter, </em>91 Idaho 11, 14 (1966) (same, as to Idaho constitution). Of perhaps greatest significance, the subject of a criminal complaint typically faces the same \u201canxiety, concern, economic debilitation, public scorn and restraint on liberty\u201d that the right to a speedy trial is intended to guard against.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gove, supra </em>at 360. See <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"713\">*713</page-number><em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Look, supra </em>at 903. For these reasons, \u201cno logical conclusion can be reached other than that the time within which an accused is to be secured in his right to a speedy trial must be computed from the time the complaint is filed against him.\u201d <em>Jacobson </em>v. <em>Winter, supra. </em>Therefore, the clock on the defendant\u2019s art. 11 right to a speedy trial began running on September 16, 1991, the date on which the District Court issued the criminal complaint charging him with rape and unarmed burglary. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Willis, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b731-5\">ii. <em>Resume versus reset. </em>The question whether the speedy trial clock \u201cresumes or resets\u201d arises in the context of formal charges that are brought, dismissed, and brought again. The issue is whether the time between an initial charge and dismissal (\u201cresume,\u201d or \u201ctolling\u201d theory), or only the time following a reinstated, formal charge (\u201creset\u201d theory), should count against the Commonwealth for purposes of a defendant\u2019s constitutional right to a speedy trial.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> We conclude that, as a general rule, the speedy trial clock \u201cresumes\u201d once a defendant is indicted following the dismissal of formal charges such that time between an initial, formal charge (or other triggering event such as an arrest) and dismissal counts against the government for speedy trial purposes after charges are reinstated.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> We reach this conclusion because the Supreme Court in <em>MacDonald </em>did not hold that the period <em>prior </em>to dismissal does not count against the government for purposes of determining whether a defendant\u2019s right to a speedy trial has been violated. Rather, the Court held that the <em>interim </em>period between dismissal of formal charges and subsequent reindictment or arrest on charges arising out of the same incident does not count against the speedy trial clock. <em>MacDonald, supra </em>at 7 n.7 (holding is consistent with Speedy Trial Act of 1974, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3161[d], 3161[h][6] [2006 &amp; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"714\">*714</page-number>Supp. Ill 2009], which provides \u201cthat if charges are initially dismissed and later reinstated, the period <em>between </em>the dismissal and the reinstatement is not to be included in computing the time within which trial must commence\u201d [emphasis added]). See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Loud </em>Hawk, 474 U.S. 302, 310-312 (1986), and cases cited <em>(Loud Hawk). </em>Like <em>MacDonald, </em>our decision in <em>Burton </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>432 Mass., 1008, 1008-1009 (2000) <em>(Burton), </em>did not address the \u201cresume versus reset\u201d issue, but instead merely stated the uncontroverted position <em>that </em>the speedy trial clock stops when the Commonwealth dismisses charges in good faith.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Notwithstanding <em>MacDonald\u2019s </em>\u201cgood faith\u201d qualifier, we think the \u201cresume\u201d theory expresses the better view because, \u201c[w]ere it otherwise, the government would be able to nullify a defendant\u2019s speedy trial right by the simple expedient of dismissing and reindicting whenever speedy trial time was running out on its prosecution.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Colombo, </em>852 F.2d 19, 23-24 (1st Cir. 1988). See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Fuesting, </em>845 F.2d 664, 668 (7th Cir. 1988) (dismissal of charges tolls speedy trial right). Cf. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Roller, </em>956 F.2d 1408, 1412-1413 (7th Cir. 1992); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Wallace, </em>848 F.2d 1464, 1469 (9th Cir. 1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b732-4\">For these reasons, we conclude that the period of more than six and one-half years between the issuance of the criminal complaint and the dismissal of charges (September 16, 1991, to April 10, 1998), and the period of more than four years between the indictment and trial (March 23, 1999, to May 5, 2003) count against the government for the purposes of the defendant\u2019s constitutional right to a speedy trial. A total delay of over ten years is undoubtedly \u201cpresumptively prejudicial.\u201d See <em>Dog-gett, supra </em>at 652 n.l.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-5\">b. <em>Analysis under </em>Barker. We turn to the test set forth in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"715\">*715</page-number><em>Barker </em>to determine whether the defendant\u2019s right to a speedy trial has been violated. This test balances (i) the length of the delay, (ii) the reasons for delay, (iii) the defendant\u2019s assertions of his speedy trial right, and (iv) the prejudice to the defendant (in light of <em>Doggetf). </em>See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Look, </em>379 Mass. 893, 897-898 (1980), citing <em>Barker, supra </em>at 530-533. We consider each factor in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-5\">i. <em>Length of the delay. </em>Length of delay \u201cis actually a double enquiry.\u201d <em>Doggett, supra </em>at 651. It first bears on whether a speedy trial analysis is triggered, and is again considered to \u201cthe extent to which the delay stretches beyond the bare minimum needed to trigger judicial examination of the [speedy trial] claim.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 651-652. We need not tarry here, as a ten-year delay, as the Commonwealth concedes, clearly weighs heavily against the Commonwealth.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-6\">ii. <em>Reasons for delay. </em>The Commonwealth has said that its own negligence caused seven and one-half years of delay.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> In so stating, the Commonwealth implicitly recognizes that it is not only prosecutorial delay that may count against the Commonwealth for purposes of a defendant\u2019s right to a speedy trial. See <em>Barker, supra </em>at 531. \u201cThe Commonwealth, in the performance of its public trust. . . [has] some \u2018duty to coordinate the efforts of its various criminal divisions.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Willis, </em>21 Mass. App. Ct. 963, 964-965 (1986), quoting <em>Brady </em>v. <em>Maryland, </em>291 Md. 261, 267 (1981). See G. L. c. 276, \u00a7 23A (warrant management system). Therefore, the Commonwealth cannot elude accountability for the delay in this case even though the prosecution was not responsible for the issuance of the complaint or the lodging of the warrant against the defendant while he was incarcerated. Moreover, we count against the Commonwealth the fact of the District Court\u2019s receipt of the defendant\u2019s request for a speedy trial but failure to docket it.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"716\">*716</page-number>Nevertheless, the second prong of the <em>Barker </em>test weighs only lightly against the Commonwealth. Although \u201cour toleration of . . . negligence varies inversely with its protractedness, . . . negligence is obviously to be weighed more lightly than a deliberate intent to harm the accused\u2019s defense.\u201d <em>Doggett, supra </em>at 657. There is no evidence of intentional delay or bad faith on the part of the Commonwealth on these facts. Moreover, although we do not focus merely on the conduct of the prosecution, we do accord greater weight to delay attributable to the prosecution than to other public actors (whether law enforcement or the courts). See <em>Barker, supra </em>at 531 (although court congestion factors against government, it weighs less heavily than prosecution\u2019s conduct). Therefore, the first period of six and one-half years (from criminal complaint to dismissal) weighs less heavily against the Commonwealth than the second period of four years (from indictment to trial). Moreover, in the latter period in which the prosecution was involved in the defendant\u2019s case, most of the delays were either at the defendant\u2019s request or by agreement of the defendant\u2019s counsel. <em>Butler I, supra </em>at 664-665 (attributing only 310 days of delay to prosecution).</p>\n<p id=\"b734-5\">iii. <em>Defendant\u2019s assertions of his right to a speedy trial. </em>It is undisputed that the defendant signed a form requesting a speedy trial on the present charges in January, 1993, while he was incarcerated on unrelated charges. Although we do not, in the defendant\u2019s words, \u201cinsist[] that a defendant must storm the [c]ourthouse and batter down the doors to preserve his right to a speedy trial,\u201d we do require more than the defendant\u2019s soft assertion of his right to a speedy trial. We agree with the Appeals Court in <em>Butler I, supra </em>at 664, \u201cthat the defendant must bear some of the responsibility because he failed to make any inquiry regarding the status of his request for a speedy trial.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> See <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"717\">*717</page-number><em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lauria, </em>411 Mass. 63, 67-69 (1991) (defendant acquiesced in delay in failing to inquire about status of Mass. R. Crim. P. 36 motion). Granted, the department of correction \u201csummary/key issues\u201d reports issued since 1994 stated that the defendant had \u201cno outstanding legal issues.\u201d However, the fact that prior department of correction \u201csummary/key issues\u201d reports (for example, a report dated April 14, 1993) stated that rape and burglary charges against the defendant were outstanding suggests that the defendant was aware at least of the possibility of pending charges, and that he intended to take advantage of the government\u2019s silence or error to \u201cfly under the radar\u201d to avoid prosecution. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Look, supra </em>at 900 (late assertion of right to speedy trial indicates that defendant was \u201cgambling\u201d that Commonwealth forgot about him). The defendant\u2019s acquiescence in the delay in bringing him to trial, thus, weighs slightly against him and, moreover, extenuates the presumptive prejudice. See <em>Doggett, supra </em>at 658.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-5\">iv. <em>Prejudice to the defendant. </em>Although the right to a speedy trial is \u201cnot primarily intended to prevent prejudice to the defense caused by passage of time,\u201d <em>MacDonald, supra </em>at 8, there remains a concern that unreasonable delay between formal accusation and trial carries the \u201cpossibility that the defense will be impaired . . . [which] skews the fairness of the entire system.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> <em>Barker, supra </em>at 532. Thus, although the defendant is not entirely absolved of responsibility to present some particularized prejudice at this stage of the analysis, he is entitled to some degree of presumptive prejudice that the Commonwealth can rebut with evidence that any delay left the defendant\u2019s \u201cability to defend himself unimpaired.\u201d <em>Doggett, supra </em>at 658 n.4. Moreover, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"718\">*718</page-number>passage of time is a double-edged sword. While at once affecting the defense, delay in bringing a case to trial may also make it more difficult, sometimes impossible, for the prosecution to carry its burden of proof beyond a reasonable doubt. See <em>Loud Hawk, supra </em>at 315.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-5\">Here, the defendant makes only general claims that his ability to defend himself was impaired based on some missing evidence, the unavailability of unspecified witnesses, and the dimming of several witnesses\u2019 memories. The Commonwealth has conceded that the loss of cushions from the couch where intercourse occurred, photographs of the door the defendant allegedly kicked in, and the written pages of the rape kit used by the hospital where the victim received treatment following the incident with the defendant have been lost due its negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-6\">Where the defendant conceded intercourse (and his admission is corroborated by DNA evidence), the loss of these items (with the possible exception of the photographs) can hardly be seen as prejudicial. Moreover, the Commonwealth has established that \u201cnothing in the record before us . . . suggests that the delay in bringing the defendant to trial precluded him from advancing his best defense.\u201d <em>Butler I, supra </em>at 667. The percipient witnesses to the rape (the defendant and the victim) were available and testified at trial; the potential significance to the defense of the testimony of the unspecified witnesses is unknown. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Look, supra </em>at 901. Similarly, it is unclear how the loss of the couch cushions impaired the defense, and the acquittal on the burglary charge and conviction of the lesser included offense of rape (as opposed to aggravated rape) suggests that the loss of the photographs of the door actually inured to the defendant\u2019s benefit. That the victim was unable to remember some details of the rape was offset by her ability to recall several statements the defendant made during intercourse that went to the crucial issue of consent. See <em>Loud Hawk, supra; Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gove, </em>366 Mass. 351, 364 (1974) (no significant failure of memory on crucial issues). What is more, whether intercourse is consensual is not a subject typically vulnerable to memory loss. Because all elements essential for a fair trial were available and any impairment to the defense is speculative at best, we conclude that the Com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"719\">*719</page-number>monwealth effectively rebutted the presumption of prejudice and that the prejudice factor counts against the defendant. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gove, supra </em>at 365; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Willis, </em>21 Mass.

The record indicates that the defendant was not incarcerated on the 1991 complaint at any point during the delay prior to his trial, and was only subject to bail for one month (March 11, 1998, to April 10, 1998). Moreover, although the lodging of a warrant on a criminal complaint for a person incarcerated at a prison or correctional facility <em>may </em>result in decreased freedom even within the confines of the prison or correctional facility, there is nothing to suggest that such was the case here. See, e.g., <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Hooey, </em>393 U.S. 374, 378-379 (1969); Yackle, Taking Stock of Detainer Statutes, 8 Loy. L.A. L. Rev. 88, 91-92 (1975). To the contrary, the defendant\u2019s acquiescence in the delay (in failing to strongly assert his speedy trial right and in assenting to post-indictment delay) suggests that he did not experience the disruption of life often associated with pending criminal charges. See <em>Doggett, supra </em>at 663 (Thomas, J., dissenting). See also <em>MacDonald, supra </em>at 8, 11; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gove, supra </em>at 360, 365. For these additional reasons, we ascertain no prejudice to the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-6\">4. <em>Conclusion. </em>In sum, although the delay from the attachment of the right to a speedy trial in September, 1991, to his trial in May, 2003 (excluding the period during which charges were dismissed), was lengthy, the <em>Barker </em>factors, applied in their totality, do not establish that the defendant\u2019s constitutional right to a speedy trial was violated. Therefore, because the decision not to advance a losing argument does not fall \u201cmeasurably below that which might be expected from an ordinary fallible lawyer,\u201d and because the defendant was not \u201cdeprived of an otherwise available, substantial ground of defence\u201d by virtue of his counsel\u2019s decision not to advance a constitutional speedy trial argument on direct appeal, we conclude that the defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"720\">*720</page-number>was not denied the effective assistance of counsel.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Saferian, </em>366 Mass. 89, 96 (1974). Therefore, the order denying his motion for a new trial is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-4\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b725-7\">The defendant has been represented by different counsel at various stages of his proceeding. He challenges the conduct only of the attorney who represented him on the direct appeal that resulted in the decision in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Butler, </em>68 Mass.

R. Crim. R 36, 378 Mass. 909 (1979), and of preindictment delay pursuant to the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment and art. 12, are meritless. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Butler, </em>79 Mass. App. Ct. 751, 758 (2011) <em>(Butler II), </em>quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dixon, </em>458 Mass. 446, 458 (2010). Therefore, our focus in this appeal is solely on the defendant\u2019s constitutional right to a speedy trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b727-7\">The appellate attorney whose conduct the defendant challenges filed an affidavit in support of the defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial. In the affidavit, he explained that he read the cases of <em>United States </em>v. <em>Loud Hawk, </em>474 U.S. 302 (1986) <em>(Loud Hawk); United States </em>v. <em>MacDonald, </em>456 U.S. 1 (1972) <em>(MacDonald); </em>and <em>Burton </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>432 Mass. 1008 (2000) <em>(Burton), </em>to mean that, when a formal charge is dismissed and later reinstated, time prior to dismissal is not counted for purposes of evaluating a speedy trial claim. Proceeding on that assumption, the attorney reasoned that the speedy trial clock in this case started anew on March 23, 1999, the date of the defendant\u2019s indictments. The attorney then asserted that he did not believe that he could make a good faith argument that the time from the March 23, 1999, indictment to the commencement of trial on May 6, 2003, was sufficient to raise a constitutional speedy trial claim. For that reason, he only presented what he believed to be the defendant\u2019s strongest argument, that the Commonwealth\u2019s delay in bringing the defendant to trial violated Mass. R. Crim. P. 36 (b) or (c).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b727-8\">Although we ultimately decide this case pursuant to art. 11 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights, we cite Federal cases that interpret the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution because the analysis is analogous.

See, e.g., <em>MacDonald, supra </em>at 7; <em>Burton, supra </em>at 1008-1009. Thus, all parties to the present action agree that the nearly one year between the dismissal of the charges against the defendant (on April 10, 1998) and the defendant\u2019s subsequent indictment on the same charges arising out of the same conduct (on March 23, 1999) does not count against the Commonwealth.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b731-7\">Our conclusion applies to reassertion of formal charges following dismissal of initial, formal charges that arise out of the same conduct, whether or not the charges are exactly the same.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b732-6\">We read <em>MacDonald, Loud Hawk, </em>and <em>Burton </em>differently from the judge who denied the defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial.

The Appeals Court in <em>Butler II, supra </em>at 756, 759, similarly subscribed to the reset theory, and affirmed the order denying the defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b733-7\">In its additional opposition to the defendant\u2019s pretrial motion to dismiss for lack of speedy trial, the Commonwealth stated that it was negligent in failing to arraign the defendant at a reasonable time after his arrest in November, 1991, on the unrelated charges. Thus, the Commonwealth conceded delay attributable to its own negligence beginning on January 1, 1992. In considering the Commonwealth\u2019s concession on negligence, the Appeals Court in <em>Butler I, supra </em>at 663-664, said that it was \u201cnot convinced that the circumstances before [it] warrant[ed] that concession.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b734-6\">Although the Appeals Court in <em>Butler I, supra </em>at 663-667, analyzed the defendant\u2019s speedy trial claim pursuant to Mass. R. Crim. P. 36 (c), the analyses under the common-law rule and under the Federal and State Constitutions are sufficiently similar that the Appeals Court\u2019s reasoning is instructive here. To establish a rule 36 (c) violation requires a showing of unreasonable delay on the part of the prosecution resulting in prejudice to the defendant. The Appeals Court in <em>Butler I, supra, </em>determined that the defendant failed to establish a rule 36 (c) violation because he bore some responsibility for failure to inquire into the status of his speedy trial request and because he failed to show prejudice.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b735-6\">Justice Thomas, dissenting in <em>Doggett </em>v. <em>United States, </em>505 U.S. 647, 662 (1992), observed that there are \u201ctwo conflicting lines of authority, the one declaring that \u2018limitflng] the possibility that the defense will be impaired\u2019 is an independent and fundamental objective of the Speedy Trial Clause, e.g., <em>Barker, supra </em>at 532, and the other declaring that it is not, e.g., <em>[United States </em>v.] <em>Marion, </em>404 U.S. 307 (1971).\u201d \u201cThe touchstone of the speedy trial right ... is the substantial deprivation of liberty that typically accompanies an \u2018accusation.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 663.

Moreover, that counsel on the defendant\u2019s direct appeal obtained review pursuant to Mass. R. Grim. P. 36 (c), several elements of which parallel the constitutional speedy trial analysis, further indicates that he was not ineffective in making the strategic decision to forgo the constitutional claim.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
