L. c. 209A to prevent his daughter, who was sixteen years of age, from voluntarily engaging in a sexual relationship with an adult.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Following a hearing before a District Court judge, an ex parte <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>abuse prevention order obtained pursuant to G. L. c. 209A, \u00a7 4, by a father on behalf of his daughter against the defendant, Gregory James Compton, was extended for one year pursuant to G. L. c. 209A, \u00a7 3. The defendant appealed to the Appeals Court. He asserts that the evidence was insufficient to support a finding of abuse and that the order should not have been extended because he and the plaintiff were not in a \u201csubstantive dating relationship\u201d as required by G. L. c. 209A, \u00a7 <em>1(e). </em>We transferred the appeal to this court on our own initiative. Because there was no basis for the judge to conclude that the defendant\u2019s conduct rose to the level of \u201cabuse\u201d as defined by G. L. c. 209A, \u00a7 1, the extension order must be vacated.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-5\">1. <em>Facts. </em>We recite the facts based on the record before us. See <em>Caplan </em>v. <em>Donovan, </em>450 Mass. 463, 464 n.l, cert, denied, 553 U.S. 1018 (2008). In July, 2011, while traveling in Europe with her mother and grandmother, the daughter, who was sixteen years of age, met the defendant, a citizen of the United Kingdom who was twenty-four years of age. In conversation with the defendant, the daughter falsely indicated that she was bom in 1992, thus making her eighteen or nineteen years of age. They exchanged contact information. A few days later, the defendant took the daughter on a tour of the area surrounding London.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-6\">The daughter returned home and maintained communication with the defendant through various electronic means, including electronic mail messages (e-mail), instant messaging,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> *Skype,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and Facebook.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The defendant does not dispute that the daughter, early in their communications, informed him that she was bom in 1994, thus making her sixteen years of age.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>Copies of various e-mails and instant messaging conversations demonstrated a mutual attraction between the daughter and the defendant and ongoing consensual electronic communications between them.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In these communications, the defendant refers to the daughter as \u201cbabe,\u201d \u201choney bee,\u201d and \u201cmy love,\u201d and ends communication by writing, \u201clov u: heart\u201d and \u201cxxx.\u201d In addition to telling the plaintiff that she is \u201camazing,\u201d the defendant talks about visiting her, their first lunch date, \u201ca v gd hotel\u201d where she could visit him, and engaging in conversation \u201cwith a glass of somthing gd in our hands.\u201d The defendant\u2019s communications include many sexual innuendos. He also graphically and expressly made known to her his intentions to engage in sexual relations with her. In their electronic exchanges, they discussed the \u201cage of consent\u201d to engage in sexual intercourse (see note 3, <em>supra), </em>as well as the age difference and physical \u201cdistance\u201d between them. Despite these \u201cchallenges,\u201d the defendant stated, \u201ci wouldnt even entertain this normally but with you it[] just makes sense.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b578-5\">The defendant made plans to visit the Boston area in October and wrote to the daughter about how they would spend their time together on his arrival. The defendant indicated he wanted \u201ca day spent in each others arms (make tht a few),\u201d acknowledged her parents\u2019 disapproval of their \u201crelationship,\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and noted that they would have to \u201csneak[] about.\u201d He suggested a \u201csneaky sleepover\u201d while he was in town and asked the daughter where she liked to be touched. The defendant reserved a room at an inn near her home and planned the trip during a time when her parents would be out of town.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>On September 30, 2011, the father filed a complaint for protection under G. L. c. 209A against the defendant and obtained an ex parte order effective until the next hearing date of October 11.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark>,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> On October 4, the defendant, who was found in the town in which he had planned to reserve his room, was served with the order. On October 11, a hearing before a different District Court judge was held to determine whether the ex parte order should be extended. The father appeared pro se, and the defendant was present and was represented by counsel. The daughter did not appear or testify.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-5\">In addition to submitting his affidavit, the father provided the judge with copies of some of the electronic communications between the defendant and the daughter. During cross-examination by defense counsel, the father admitted that the defendant had not threatened physical harm to the daughter. Nor did the father have any evidence that the defendant \u201ccaused [the daughter] to engage involuntarily in sexual relations by force, threat, or duress.\u201d In addition to filing an affidavit, the defendant testified. Much of his testimony was indiscernible by the court reporter because of noise, but the defendant testified that he \u201cwould never do anything that could possibly hurt [the daughter].\u201d He testified that he told the mother that he would not have contact with the daughter and claimed that he \u201ckept to that.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b579-6\">The judge rejected defense counsel\u2019s arguments that an abuse prevention order was inappropriate because there were no allegations of physical abuse or involuntary sexual conduct, and no evidence of a substantive dating relationship. The judge did not explain, however, on what basis he found abuse or the existence of a substantive dating relationship. He extended the abuse prevention order \u201cin all respects\u201d for one year. This appeal followed.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The father is represented by counsel on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-7\">2. <em>Discussion. </em>We review the issuance of an order pursuant to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>G. L. c. 209A for an abuse of discretion or other error of law. <em>Crenshaw </em>v. <em>Macklin, </em>430 Mass. 633, 636 (2000). \u201cWe accord the credibility determinations of the judge who \u2018heard the testimony of the parties . . . [and] observed their demeanor\u2019 . . . the utmost deference.\u201d <em>Ginsberg </em>v. <em>Blacker, </em>67 Mass. App. Ct. 139, 140 n.3 (2006), quoting <em>Pike </em>v. <em>Maguire, </em>47 Mass. App. Ct. 929, 929 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b580-5\">General Laws c. 209A enables a person \u201csuffering from abuse from an adult or minor family or household member\u201d to obtain a protective order directing the defendant, among other things, to refrain from abuse or contact. G. L. c. 209A, \u00a7 3. Under G. L. c. 209A, \u00a7 1 <em>(e), </em>family or household members include persons who \u201care or have been in a substantive dating or engagement relationship.\u201d \u201cAbuse\u201d is defined as \u201cthe occurrence of one or more of the following acts between family or household members: <em>(a) </em>attempting to cause or causing physical harm; <em>(b) </em>placing another in fear of imminent serious physical harm; <em>(c) </em>causing another to engage involuntarily in sexual relations by force, threat or duress.\u201d G. L. c. 209A, \u00a7 1. The issuance of an abuse prevention order is a civil procedure, and abuse need only be proved by a preponderance of the evidence. See <em>Jordan </em>v. <em>Clerk of the Wes field Div. of the Dist. Court Dep\u2019t, </em>425 Mass. 1016, 1017 (1997). A violation of an order to refrain from abuse or contact, however, is a crime, punishable by a fine or imprisonment in a house of correction, or both. G. L. c. 209A, \u00a7 7, fifth par. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Finase, </em>435 Mass. 310, 313-314 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b580-6\">Here, as conceded by the father, the defendant has neither physically harmed nor attempted physically to harm the daughter. In addition, because she is over the age of sixteen, she is legally capable of \u201cconsenting\u201d to sexual intercourse, see note 3, <em>supra, </em>and as admitted by the father, the defendant has not caused the daughter to engage <em>involuntarily </em>in sexual relations <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>by force, threat, or duress. Thus, there was no basis for the judge to issue the extension order under G. L. c. 209A, \u00a7 1 <em>(a) </em>or (c).</p>\n<p id=\"b581-5\">The father contends that the defendant\u2019s actions placed the daughter \u201cin fear of imminent serious physical harm\u201d under G. L. c. 209A, \u00a7 1 <em>(b), </em>because in suggesting that he was going to supply the plaintiff with alcohol, the defendant essentially offered to supply alcohol to a minor in violation of G. L. c. 138, \u00a7 34 (\u201cwhoever furnishes . . . alcohol for a person under 21 years of age shall be punished by a fine ... or by imprisonment for not more than one year or both\u201d). We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-6\">The definition of \u201cabuse\u201d under G. L. c. 209A, \u00a7 1 <em>(b), </em>closely approximates the common-law definition of the crime of assault, and we are guided by our definition in considering whether the defendant\u2019s conduct rose to such level of \u201cabuse\u201d under the statute. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gordon, </em>407 Mass. 340, 349-350 (1990). We consider whether the defendant\u2019s conduct placed the daughter in \u201creasonable apprehension that [the defendant] might physically abuse her.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 350. The defendant\u2019s passing references in his electronic communications with the daughter implying that he might furnish her with alcohol, while understandably reprehensible to the father, is not evidence suggesting physical abuse or evidence that the defendant planned to give alcohol to her in order to have involuntary sexual relations with her, certainly a form of physical abuse. We conclude that this conduct does not meet the definition of \u201cabuse\u201d under G. L. c. 209A, \u00a7 1 <em>(b), </em>and thus fails to serve as a basis for issuing the extension order.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Because the judge had no basis to issue the extension order, it must be vacated.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-7\">Our conclusion, that there was no \u201cabuse\u201d as required by the statute, obviates the need to decide whether the father proved by a preponderance of the evidence that his daughter and the defendant were engaged in a \u201csubstantive dating relationship\u201d within the meaning of G. L. c. 209A, \u00a7 1 <em>(e). </em>Nevertheless, because it would be instructive in other cases, we conclude that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>there was evidence of a substantive dating relationship in the circumstances of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-5\">General Laws c. 209A, \u00a7 1, directs courts to adjudge the existence of substantive dating relationships by considering four factors: \u201c(1) the length of time of the relationship; (2) the type of relationship; (3) the frequency of interaction between the parties; and (4) if the relationship has been terminated by either person, the length of time elapsed since the termination of the relationship.\u201d Here, there was a three-month relationship that involved regular mutual communication. Although, after the daughter\u2019s return home from Europe, that communication occurred electronically, many of the transmissions, such as those through instant messaging and Skype, involved \u201creal-time\u201d communication and face-to-face communication, thus adding a level of intimacy to the relationship. Significantly, the parties to the relationship did not stand on equal footing in terms of emotional maturity. One party to the relationship was a minor, to whom we afford unique protection, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>A Juvenile (No. 1), </em>389 Mass. 128, 132 (1983), and the other party was an adult who held himself out to \u201clove\u201d the minor. The content of the conversations were intimate, reflected a mutual romantic relationship, and expressed a mutual desire to engage in sexual relations. In these circumstances, we conclude that a substantive dating relationship was established. If the defendant had threatened to harm the daughter (rather than seeking to engage in a consensual sexual relationship with her), G. L. c. 209A should be available to protect her.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-6\">Our conclusion comports with fulfilling the remedial purpose of the statute. See <em>C.O. </em>v. <em>M.M., </em>442 Mass. 648, 653 (2004) (noting that, when enacting abuse prevention statute, \u201cLegislature intended to address violence stemming from relationships which may not be considered traditional \u2018family or household\u2019 associations\u201d and that judicial guidelines on abuse prevention properly instruct courts to afford broad meaning to term \u201csubstantive dating relationship\u201d to protect remedial purpose of the statute). It also reflects the changing nature of relationships and, specifically, the fact that an increasing number of relationships, including ones involving teenagers, are being conducted electronically. See <em>id. </em>(\u201cDating is inherently personal and idiosyncratic, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>relationships exist in endless variety\u201d). See also King-Ries, Teens, Technology, and Cyberstalking: The Domestic Violence Wave of the Future?, 20 Tex. J. Women &amp; Law 131, 152 (2011) (study results showed teenagers \u201care incorporating technology into their intimate relationships\u201d). Chapter 209A must be interpreted to protect all who are in a substantive dating relationship from abuse, regardless of whether the relationship was developed or conducted by the use of technology.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-5\">3. <em>Conclusion. </em>The abuse prevention extension order issued October 11, 2011, is vacated. The District Court judge shall cause a notification and direction to be sent, conformably with G. L. c. 209A, \u00a7 7, third par., for the destruction of all records of the vacated order. See <em>Carroll </em>v. <em>Kartell, </em>56 Mass. App. Ct. 83, 87-88 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b583-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b576-15\">A person sixteen years of age or older is legally capable of \u201cconsenting\u201d to sexual intercourse.
