L. c. 268, \u00a7 13B, as appearing in St. 2006, c. 48, \u00a7 3, for a parolee to mislead a parole officer who is investigating the parolee\u2019s possible failure to comply with parole conditions. We conclude that it is, and therefore affirm the defendant\u2019s convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-16\"><em>Background. </em>In October, 2007, the defendant was on parole from his State prison sentence for armed robbery, and on proba<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>tion for his conviction of rape of a child. Among the conditions of the defendant\u2019s parole were that he not go to areas where children under eighteen years of age would congregate, that he not enter into a relationship with someone who had children without informing his parole officer, that he wear a global positioning system (GPS) monitoring unit that recorded his whereabouts at all times, and that he keep a calendar recording where he went each day. On October 29, 2007, the defendant\u2019s parole officer, Kathryn Kozak, informed the defendant that he was not to leave his home in Marlborough after 6 p.m. on Halloween night, October 31, 2007, and was not to participate in any Halloween activities. On November 1, 2007, Kozak checked the defendant\u2019s GPS location from the previous night and determined that he had been to Framingham after 6 p.m. When she called him to ask why he had gone to Framingham, the defendant stated that he had taken a bus there to attend a meeting of Alcoholics Anonymous (AA). Kozak determined from GPS records that, while in Framingham, the defendant had been at an apartment complex two to three miles away from the location where he claimed he had attended the AA meeting. When his parole officer confronted him with this information, the defendant replied that there must have been \u201ca glitch\u201d in the GPS system. After this conversation, the defendant was placed in custody on a fifteen-day parole detainer. His parole was later revoked, and his probation terminated.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-5\">On July 1, 2008, the defendant was indicted for misleading a parole officer with the intent to obstruct a criminal proceeding, in violation of G. L. c. 268, \u00a7 13B; and for being a habitual criminal, in violation of G. L. c. 279, \u00a7 25. The defendant waived his right to a trial by jury, and was tried by a judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-6\">The evidence at trial revealed that in October, 2007, the defendant had a romantic relationship with Yudrey Millares, the mother of four young children, which he had failed to reveal to his parole officer. Millares often brought all four of her children with her to stay the night at the defendant\u2019s apartment in Marlborough. The defendant also occasionally visited Millares at her apartment in Framingham while her children were present. On the Halloween night at issue, the defendant came to Millares\u2019s apartment, joined Millares and her children in walking door to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>door in her neighborhood trick-or-treating, and left in a taxicab. The defendant later told Millares that \u201che couldn\u2019t be out on that day,\u201d and instructed her to deny knowing him if anyone ever asked questions about him. At the defendant\u2019s request, Millares asked a friend to write a letter falsely claiming that the friend had cared for Millares\u2019s children on Halloween night, and sent the letter to the defendant\u2019s attorney.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b385-6\">The judge denied the defendant\u2019s motion for a required finding of not guilty and found the defendant guilty of violating G. L. c. 268, \u00a7 13B. At a second bench trial, the judge found the defendant guilty of being a habitual offender under G. L. c. 279, \u00a7 25, and sentenced him, as required under \u00a7 25, to the maximum penalty under \u00a7 13B, a State prison term not to exceed ten years.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b385-7\"><em>Discussion. </em>At the time of the alleged offense in 2007, G. L. c. 268, \u00a7 13B, as appearing in St. 2006, c. 48, \u00a7 3 (\u00a7 13B), provided, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b385-8\">\u201cWhoever, directly or indirectly, willfully <em>...(c) </em>misleads, intimidates or harasses another person who is (i) a witness or potential witness at any stage of a criminal investigation, grand jury proceeding, trial or other criminal proceeding of any type; (ii) a person who is or was aware of information, records, documents or objects that relate to a violation of a criminal statute, or a violation of conditions of probation, parole or bail; (iii) a . . . probation officer or parole officer; [or] (iv) a person who is or was furthering a criminal investigation, grand jury proceeding, trial or other criminal proceeding of any type; . . . with the intent to impede, obstruct, delay, harm, punish or otherwise interfere thereby with a criminal investigation, grand jury proceeding, trial or other criminal proceeding of any type shall be punished.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b385-10\">The defendant claims that the judge erred in denying the motion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>for a required finding of not guilty because \u00a7 13B makes it a crime to mislead a parole officer with the intent to obstruct a \u201ccriminal proceeding of any type,\u201d and there was no evidence of a \u201ccriminal proceeding\u201d when the defendant made the misleading statements to his parole officer. Therefore, the question in this case is whether a parole officer\u2019s investigation into a potential violation of the conditions of a defendant\u2019s parole constitutes a \u201ccriminal proceeding of any type\u201d within the meaning of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-5\">The phrase, \u201ccriminal proceeding of any type,\u201d is not defined in the statute, so we must look to our traditional principles of statutory interpretation to determine its meaning. Perhaps the most fundamental principle \u201cis that a statute must be interpreted according to the intent of the Legislature ascertained from all its words construed by the ordinary and approved usage of the language, considered in connection with the cause of its enactment, the mischief or imperfection to be remedied and the main object to be accomplished, to the end that the purpose of its framers may be effectuated.\u201d <em>Harvard Crimson, Inc. </em>v. <em>President &amp; Fellows of Harvard College, </em>445 Mass. 745, 749 (2006), quoting <em>Hanlon </em>v. <em>Rollins, </em>286 Mass. 444, 447 (1934). \u201cWhere possible, we construe the various provisions of a statute in harmony with one another, recognizing that the Legislature did not intend internal contradiction.\u201d <em>DiFiore </em>v. <em>American Airlines, Inc., </em>454 Mass. 486, 491 (2009). \u201cIf a sensible construction is available, we shall not construe a statute to make a nullity of pertinent provisions or to produce absurd results.\u201d <em>Flemings </em>v. <em>Contributory Retirement Appeal Bd., </em>431 Mass. 374, 375-376 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b386-6\">In applying these principles, we note that \u00a7 13B was amended and rewritten in 2006 to expand the scope of the conduct prohibited, the classes of victims protected, and the types of criminal proceedings covered. See <em>Hrycenko </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>459 Mass. 503, 508 (2011); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hamilton, </em>459 Mass. 422, 435 (2011).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Although \u00a7 13B before the 2006 amendment protected only witnesses and jurors in a criminal investigation, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>or \u201cin any stage of a trial, grand jury, or other criminal proceeding,\u201d* ***<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> \u00a7 13B after the 2006 amendment also specifically protected, among others, probation and parole officers in \u201ca criminal investigation, grand jury proceeding, trial or other criminal proceeding of any type,\u201d as well as persons who are \u201caware of information, records, documents or objects that relate to a . . . violation of conditions of probation [or] parole.\u201d By adding provisions specifically protecting parole officers and those with information regarding a parole violation (who often are also parole officers), we discern a legislative intent to protect parole officers from intimidating or misleading conduct committed with the intent to obstruct investigations into potential parole violations that may lead to the revocation of parole and the return of defendants to prison or jail. If a \u201ccriminal proceeding of any type\u201d did not include such an investigation, then this legislative intent would be thwarted, and parole officers would not be protected from intimidation or misleading conduct in the type of investigations that they most commonly conduct. Because the statute before its 2006 revision already protected any \u201cwitness or juror,\u201d we conclude that the specific inclusion of parole officers and those with information regarding a parole violation as protected classes of victims was intended to do more than protect these individuals as potentially testifying witnesses at a parole revocation hearing or a criminal trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-5\">The defendant seeks to distinguish matters of parole from \u201ccriminal proceeding[s]\u201d by noting that a parolee alleged to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>have violated the conditions of his parole does not enjoy the full panoply of rights enjoyed by a criminal defendant. We acknowledge that the process due a parolee faced with revocation is less than that due a defendant faced with a criminal charge. See <em>Morrissey </em>v. <em>Brewer, </em>408 U.S. 471, 480 (1972), citing <em>Mempa </em>v. <em>Rhay, </em>389 U.S. 128 (1967). But we do not discern a legislative intent to limit the definition of a \u201ccriminal proceeding of any type\u201d to proceedings that provide defendants with procedural rights equivalent to those provided to criminal defendants at trial. Section 13B expressly includes a \u201ccriminal investigation\u201d and a \u201cgrand jury proceeding\u201d as a type of \u201ccriminal proceeding\u201d even though the subjects of criminal investigations have few procedural rights. We conclude that the Legislature meant to include within the rubric of \u201ccriminal proceeding[s] of any type\u201d any investigation or proceeding that may result in criminal-type sanctions, such as loss of liberty, and note that a parolee under investigation for a parole violation may go to prison or jail after a parole revocation as surely as a defendant under criminal investigation or on trial may after a conviction.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AgMX\">We have also considered whether the Legislature intended a \u201ccriminal proceeding\u201d to commence in the context of parole revocation only after a formal allegation has been lodged of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>violation of parole. We note that \u00a7 13B protects anyone aware of information relating to a violation of conditions of parole and conclude that a \u201ccriminal proceeding\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 13B commences on the investigation of a possible parole violation, just as it commences on the investigation of a possible criminal violation.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> For the above reasons, we conclude that the Legislature intended to include the investigation of a possible parole violation as a \u201ccriminal proceeding of any type\u201d and to protect parole officers and those with information about violations of parole conditions from intimidation and misleading conduct during the course of such investigations.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-5\">Having determined that an investigation of a possible parole violation is a \u201ccriminal proceeding\u201d within \u00a7 13B, we turn to the question whether the evidence was sufficient to support a finding that the defendant misled the parole officer. The word \u201cmisleads\u201d is not defined in \u00a7 13B, and we have not before had the opportunity to define it. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fortuna, </em>80 Mass. App. Ct. 45, 50-51 (2011) (first reported case involving prong of \u00a7 13B prohibiting one from wilfully misleading police officer with intent to impede criminal investigation). Under Federal law, the statute prohibiting witness tampering, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1512(b) (2006 &amp; Supp. II 2008), punishes one who \u201cengages in misleading conduct toward another person\u201d with the intent, inter alia, to \u201cinfluence, delay, or prevent the testimony of any person in an official proceeding,\u201d or \u201chinder, delay, or prevent\u201d information from being communicated to a law enforcement officer or judge regarding the commission of a Federal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>offense or a violation of the conditions of supervised release or parole.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The term \u201cmisleading conduct,\u201d as used in \u00a7 1512(b), is defined by statute as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b390-5\">\u201c(A) knowingly making a false statement; (B) intentionally omitting information from a statement and thereby causing a portion of such statement to be misleading, or intentionally concealing a material fact, and thereby creating a false impression by such statement; (C) with intent to mislead, knowingly submitting or inviting reliance on a writing or recording that is false, forged, altered, or otherwise lacking in authenticity; (D) with intent to mislead, knowingly submitting or inviting reliance on a sample, specimen, map, photograph, boundary mark, or other object that is misleading in a material respect; or (E) knowingly using a trick, scheme, or device with intent to mislead.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b390-6\">18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1515(a)(3) (2006). In defining what it means to \u201cmislead\u201d another person under \u00a7 13B, we hereby adopt this definition of \u201cmisleading conduct.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b390-7\">Applying this definition, we conclude that the judge did not err in denying the defendant\u2019s motion for a required finding of not guilty. In reviewing such a denial, we ask \u201cwhether, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, <em>'any </em>rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt\u2019 \u201d (emphasis in original). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Perez, </em>460 Mass. 683, 702 (2011), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Latimore, </em>378 Mass. 671,677 (1979). Where, as here, the parole officer was investigating a possible violation of her directive that the defendant remain home after 6 p.m. on Halloween to avoid congregating with children who were out trick-or-treating, there was abundant evidence for a rational trier of fact to conclude that the defendant misled his parole officer with the intent to obstruct her investigation. On being asked why he left his home, the defendant told his parole officer that he had attended an AA meeting in Framingham and that the GPS information reflecting that he had been in an apartment complex must have arisen from a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>\u201cglitch\u201d in the GPS system. He intentionally concealed his visit to Millares\u2019s apartment and his trick-or-treating activities with her children. Where the defendant attempted to mislead his parole officer with the intent to obstruct her investigation of his possible violation of parole, it does not matter that he failed to succeed in misleading her. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rivera, </em>76 Mass. App. Ct. 530, 535 (2010) (under \u00a7 13B, \u201c[n]either before or after the amendment was it necessary to establish that the [prohibited conduct] was successful\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b391-4\"><em>Conclusion. </em>We affirm the defendant\u2019s convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-5\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b385-11\">Yudrey Millares testified pursuant to a grant of immunity.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b385-12\">The judge ordered the sentence to be served concurrently with the sentence the defendant was serving for his probation violation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b385-13\">GeneralLaws c. 268, \u00a7 13B (\u00a7 13B), was twice amended in 2010, but the amendments do not bear on the issue on appeal.

But we also affirm that, as amended in 2006, \u201c\u00a7 13B is directed at proceedings within the criminal justice system,\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gallant, </em>453 Mass. 535, 542 (2009), and matters of parole are undoubtedly part of the criminal justice system. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pagan, </em>445 Mass. 161, 168 (2005) (\u201cWe have made clear that parole is a form of punishment\u201d); <em>Massachusetts Parole Bd. </em>v. <em>Brusgulis, </em>403 Mass. 1010, 1011 (1989), citing <em>Morrissey </em>v. <em>Brewer, </em>408 U.S. 471, 477 (1972) (\u201cParole constitutes a <em>variation </em>on imprisonment, . . . and not an unrestrained release from confinement\u201d [emphasis in original]); <em>Hartford </em>v. <em>Hartford, </em>60 Mass.

We conclude that the Legislature in amending \u00a7 13B in 2006 must have intended to include some proceedings that were not a \u201cstage of a criminal prosecution,\u201d <em>Gagnon </em>v. <em>Scarpelli, supra, </em>because \u00a7 13B as amended did not refer to any \u201cstage\u201d of a criminal proceeding, but to a \u201ccriminal proceeding of any type.\u201d See <em>Hrycenko </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, supra </em>at 509-510 &amp; n.9 (specifically noting that \u201c \u2018at any stage of a . . . proceeding\u2019 language in the 2006 statute applies only to witnesses or potential witnesses\u201d under \u00a7 13B (1) <em>(c) </em>(i), and not to other classes of protected victims, including parole officers).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b389-6\">Although 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001 (2006), the Federal statute punishing \u201cmaterially false, fictitious, or fraudulent statement[s] or representation[s] \u201d made \u201cin any matter within the jurisdiction of the executive, legislative, or judicial branch of the Government of the United States,\u201d covers a broader scope of proceedings than does \u00a7 13B, we note that several Federal Circuit Courts of Appeals have held that materially false statements made to parole officers by individuals on supervised release constitute criminal violations of this statute, even before a formal allegation of a parole violation has been brought.
