(Michaels), filed an action on behalf of herself and a putative class of Michaels customers in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts. Tyler\u2019s complaint alleged that Michaels unlawfully writes customers\u2019 personal identification information on credit card transaction forms in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>violation of G. L. c. 93, \u00a7 105 <em>(a) </em>(\u00a7 105 [a]), when Michaels\u2019s employees request and record customers\u2019 zip codes in processing credit card transactions.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> A judge of the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts certified the following questions to this court pursuant to S.J.C. Rule 1:03, as appearing in 382 Mass. 700 (1981):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b511-4\">\u201c1. Under [G. L. c.] 93, [\u00a7] 105 <em>(a), </em>may a [zip code] be \u2018personal identification information\u2019 because a [zip code] could be necessary to the credit card issuer to identify the card holder in order to complete the transaction?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b511-5\">\u201c2. Under [G. L. c.] 93, [\u00a7] 105 <em>(a), </em>may a plaintiff bring an action for this privacy right violation absent identity fraud?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b511-6\">\u201c3. Under [G. L. c.] 93, [\u00a7] 105 <em>(a), </em>may the words \u2018credit card transaction form\u2019 refer equally to an electronic or a paper transaction form?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b511-7\">We answer \u201cYes\u201d to the first question, but for different reasons than the judge set forth in the question itself. We also answer \u201cYes\u201d to the second and third questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-8\"><em>Background. </em>Tyler\u2019s complaint alleges the following facts that we accept as true for the purposes of answering the certified questions. On several occasions during the past year, Tyler made purchases with a credit card at a Michaels retail store in Everett. During these transactions, a Michaels employee asked Tyler to provide her zip code. Tyler disclosed the number under the mistaken impression that she was required to do so in order to complete the credit card transaction, but in fact, the credit card issuer did not require Michaels to request zip codes. Michaels maintains a policy of writing customers\u2019 names, credit card numbers, and zip codes on electronic credit card transaction forms in connection with credit card purchases. Michaels used Tyler\u2019s name and zip code in conjunction with other corn-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>mercially available databases to find her address and telephone number. Tyler subsequently received unsolicited and unwanted marketing material from Michaels.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-5\">Tyler filed her class action complaint against Michaels on May 23, 2011, claiming that Michaels\u2019s electronic recording of customer zip codes amounts to writing personal identification information on a credit card transaction form in violation of \u00a7 105 <em>(a) </em>and therefore constitutes an unfair or deceptive act or practice as defined in G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 2. The complaint also contains a claim for unjust enrichment and seeks a declaratory judgment that Michaels\u2019s collection of zip codes violates \u00a7 105 <em>(a). </em>Michaels filed a motion to dismiss the complaint on July 22, 2011. On January 6, 2012, the District Court judge granted the motion. The judge concluded that (1) Tyler sufficiently alleged a violation of \u00a7 105 (a) because zip codes constitute personal identification information,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and Michaels\u2019s electronic credit card terminal may contain \u201ccredit card transaction form[s]\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 105 (a); but (2) the complaint failed to allege that Michaels\u2019s collection of zip codes caused Tyler an injury cognizable under G. L. c. 93A. The judge also concluded that the complaint failed to state a claim for unjust enrichment and that Tyler was not entitled to the declaratory relief she sought. At the invitation of the judge, on January 13, 2012, Tyler filed a motion to certify certain questions concerning the proper interpretation of \u00a7 105 (a) to this court. The judge certified the three questions set forth <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b512-6\"><em>Discussion. </em>All three questions turn on the meaning and purpose of \u00a7 105 (a), and G. L. c. 93, \u00a7 105 (\u00a7 105), more generally. It is therefore useful to identify the purpose or purposes of these statutory provisions at the outset.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-7\">Section 105 <em>(a) </em>provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b512-8\">\u201cNo person, firm, partnership, corporation or other business entity that accepts a credit card for a business transac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>tion shall write, cause to be written or require that a credit card holder write personal identification information, not required by the credit card issuer, on the credit card transaction form. Personal identification information shall include, but shall not be limited to, a credit card holder\u2019s address or telephone number. The provisions of this section shall apply to all credit card transactions; provided, however, that the provisions of this section shall not be construed to prevent a person, firm, partnership, corporation or other business entity from requesting information . . . necessary for shipping, delivery or installation of purchased merchandise or services or for a warranty when such information is provided voluntarily by a credit card holder.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b513-5\">Section 105 <em>(d) </em>states that \u201c[a]ny violation of the provisions of this chapter shall be deemed to be an unfair and deceptive trade practice, as defined in section 2 of chapter 93A.\u201d Thus, a violation of \u00a7 105 <em>(a) </em>is unlawful under G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 2,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and may be the basis for a claim under c. 93A, \u00a7 9.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b513-6\">The judge opined that the main purpose of \u00a7 105 (a) is to prevent identity fraud and not, as Tyler contends, to protect consumer privacy. Michaels advances the same interpretation of the statute as the judge. We disagree for three reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-7\">First, keeping in mind the rule that the actual words chosen by the Legislature are critical to the task of statutory interpretation,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> there is nothing in the actual language of \u00a7 105 <em>(a) </em>to suggest that its purpose is confined to preventing identity fraud. Rather, by its inclusive terms \u00a7 105 (a) reflects concern about, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>and an intent to limit, disclosure of personal information leading to the identification of a particular consumer generally.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-5\">Thus, \u00a7 105 <em>(a) </em>expressly \u201capplies to <em>all </em>credit card transactions\u201d and delineates a general prohibition that <em>\u201c[n]o </em>person, firm, partnership, corporation or other business entity . . . shall write, cause to be written or require that a credit card holder write personal identification information, not required by the credit card issuer, on the credit card transaction form\u201d (emphases supplied). The statute also defines \u201c[p]ersonal identification information\u201d in a nonexclusive manner, stating that the term \u201cshall include, but shall not be limited to, a credit card holder\u2019s address or telephone number.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We discern nothing in these expansive and general terms that indicates or suggests that prevention of identity fraud was the single point of legislative focus.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-6\">Second, and contrary to the District Court judge, we find the title of \u00a7 105 to offer useful guidance. See, e.g., <em>American Family Life Assur. Co. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Ins. </em>388 Mass. 468, 474, cert, denied, 464 U.S. 850 (1983), and cases cited (\u201calthough the title of an act cannot control the plain provisions of the act, it may aid construction of ambiguous clauses\u201d). Section 105 was inserted in the General Laws by St. 1991, c. 414, \u00a7 1. The title of this act is \u201cAn Act relative to consumer privacy in commercial transactions.\u201d The significance of this title gains strength from the fact that in the text itself, the Legislature inserted a caption into the General Laws for this new legislation. Thus, St. 1991, c. 414, \u00a7 1, begins: \u201cChapter 93 of the General Laws is hereby amended by adding under the caption \u2018CONSUMER PRIVACY IN COMMERCIAL TRANSACTIONS,\u2019 the following two sections: [\u00a7\u00a7 104<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and 105].\u201d Both title and caption thus expressly reference \u201cconsumer privacy in commercial transactions,\u201d reinforcing the view that the Legislature indeed was concerned, as Tyler suggests, about privacy issues in the realm of commercial dealings and in any event was not necessarily focused solely on preventing identity fraud.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-7\">The third reason for our disagreement relates to the legisla-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>five history of \u00a7 105. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Welch, 444 Mass. 80, 85 (2005), rev\u2019d on other grounds, <em>O\u2019Brien </em>v. <em>Borowski, </em>461 Mass. 415, 425 (2012) (although \u201c[o]ur starting point is ... the plain language of the statute, ... we also seek guidance from its legislative history\u201d). As detailed in the following paragraph, this history strongly suggests that there were at least two privacy-related purposes underlying \u00a7 105: credit card identity fraud and consumer privacy.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-5\">The legislation that ultimately was enacted as \u00a7 105 in December of 1991 was introduced by Senator Lois Pines and then Representative Suzanne Bump. See 1991 Senate Doc. No. 89; 1991 Senate Doc. No. 1510; 1991 House Doc. No. 6112. The legislative record pertaining to this legislation includes a memorandum specifically prepared in March, 1990, for Senator Pines by the Boston University Legislative Services, entitled \u201cA Bill regulating check cashing and credit card acceptance procedures\u201d (Pines memorandum) and a report prepared in November, 1990, by the Massachusetts Public Interest Research Group (MASSPIRG), entitled \u201cWhat They Know Can Hurt You: A Survey of Retail Merchant Check Cashing and Credit Card Policies\u201d (MASSPIRG report). The Pines memorandum describes the need for, and contains a preliminary draft of, the text of what became 1991 Senate Doc. No. 89, a bill introduced by Senator Pines that served as the principal predecessor to 1991 Senate Doc. No. 1510. See Pines memorandum, <em>supra </em>at 2-7, 38. The 1991 Senate Doc. No. 1510, in turn, was enacted as St. 1991, c. 414.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> These documents indicate that the proposed legislation had two distinct goals: for check transactions (now covered in \u00a7 105 [6]<footnotemark>8</footnotemark>), the goal or purpose was to prohibit recording of credit card information on checks to prevent misuse <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>and credit card fraud;<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and for credit card transactions (now covered in \u00a7 105 [a]), the purpose was to safeguard consumer privacy and more particularly to protect consumers using credit cards from becoming the recipients of unwanted commercial solicitations from merchants with access to their identifying information.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Additional evidence of the Legislature\u2019s dual purpose in creating \u00a7 105 may be derived from Governor Weld\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>papers concerning 1991 Senate Doc. No. 1510, which contain an October, 1991, memorandum from the Executive Office of Consumer Affairs (Consumer Affairs memorandum), and a December, 1991, memorandum from the Governor\u2019s deputy legal counsel (Governor\u2019s memorandum). They explain that the objective of 1991 Senate Doc. No. 1510 \u201cis to protect consumers\u2019 privacy and protect them from fraud.\u201d Consumer Affairs memorandum, <em>supra </em>at 1. Governor\u2019s memorandum, <em>supra </em>at 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-5\">To summarize: based on the text, title and caption, and legislative history of \u00a7 105, we are persuaded that the principal purpose of \u00a7 105 (a), in contrast to \u00a7 105 <em>(b), </em>is to guard consumer privacy in credit card transactions, not to protect against credit card identity fraud.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Against this backdrop, we now turn to the three certified questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-6\">1. <em>Meaning of \u2018\u2018personal identification </em>information.\u201d The first certified question asks whether a zip code is \u201c[pjersonal identification information\u201d under \u00a7 105 <em>(a).</em><footnotemark><em>12</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The statute defines \u201cpersonal identification information\u201d as including, but not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>limited to, \u201ca credit card holder\u2019s address or telephone number.\u201d G. L. c. 93, \u00a7 105 <em>(a). </em>As indicated previously, this definition is explicitly nonexhaustive. Although a cardholder\u2019s address and telephone number unquestionably constitute personal identification information, the definition leaves open the possibility that other information may also so qualify. Tyler contends that because a zip code is part of an address, and \u00a7 105 <em>(a) </em>defines a cardholder\u2019s address as personal identification information, the zip code automatically qualifies as personal identification information as well.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Even if we agree with Michaels that this deductive reasoning fails, we still conclude that a zip code may well qualify as personal identification information under \u00a7 105 <em>(a). </em>This is so because, according to (and accepting for present purposes) the allegations of the complaint, a consumer\u2019s zip code, when combined with the consumer\u2019s name, provides the merchant with enough information to identify through publicly available databases the consumer\u2019s address or telephone number, the very information \u00a7 105 <em>(a) </em>expressly identifies as personal identification information. In other words, to conclude in those circumstances that zip codes are not \u201cpersonal identification information\u201d under the statute would render hollow the statute\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>explicit prohibition on the collection of customer addresses and telephone numbers, and undermine the statutory purpose of consumer protection. See <em>Adamowicz </em>v. <em>Ipswich, </em>395 Mass. 757, 760 (1985), quoting <em>Lexington </em>v. <em>Bedford, </em>378 Mass. 562, 570 (1979) (\u201cThe construction of a statute which leads to a determination that a piece of legislation is ineffective will not be adopted if the statutory language is \u2018fairly susceptible to a construction that would lead to a logical and sensible result\u2019 \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b519-5\">2. <em>Requirements for bringing an action under \u00a7105 </em>(a). The second question asks whether a plaintiff may bring an action for a violation of \u00a7 105 (a) absent identity fraud. We see no reason to read into the statute a requirement that one be the victim of identity fraud in order to assert a claim under that statute. It does not contain an express limitation to that effect, and as previously discussed, we interpret \u00a7 105 (a) itself as being intended primarily to address invasion of consumer privacy by merchants, not identity fraud. The achievement of this purpose would be hindered rather than advanced by imposing a requirement that the plaintiff be a victim of identity fraud in order to raise a claim of statutory violation. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>De\u2019Amicis, </em>450 Mass. 271, 276 (2007), quoting <em>Hanlon </em>v. <em>Rollins, </em>286 Mass. 444, 447 (1934) (\u201ca statute must be interpreted according to the intent of the Legislature ascertained from all its words . . . considered in connection with the cause of its enactment, the mischief or imperfection to be remedied and the main object to be accomplished\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b519-6\">Accordingly, our direct answer to the second question is that a plaintiff may bring an action for a violation of \u00a7 105 <em>{a) </em>without alleging a claim of identity fraud. We accept the judge\u2019s invitation to expand on this answer, however, and consider briefly the issue of what must be alleged in such an action with respect to injury or loss.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-7\">Because \u00a7 105 <em>(d) </em>provides that a violation of \u00a7 105 <em>(a) </em>\u201cshall be deemed to be an unfair and deceptive trade practice, as defined in [G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 2],\u201d a consumer seeking to bring an action for a violation of this statute would do so pursuant to G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 9 (1), as Tyler has done in this case. A complaint under G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 9 (1), see note 4, <em>supra, </em>must allege that the plaintiff has been \u201cinjured\u201d by the act or practice claimed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>to be unfair or deceptive and therefore unlawful under c. 93A, \u00a7 2. Tyler relies on <em>Leardi </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>394 Mass. 151 (1985) <em>(Leardi), </em>and argues that a violation of \u00a7 105 <em>(a) </em>directly equates with an injury under c. 93A, \u00a7 9 (1), and therefore, a complaint alleging a violation of \u00a7 105 <em>(a), </em>without more, satisfies the injury requirement of c. 93A, \u00a7 9, and entitles the plaintiff to recover damages, nominal or otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-5\">The <em>Leardi </em>case considered an amendment to G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 9, that eliminated the requirement that one suffer a \u201closs of money or property\u201d in order to be \u201cinjured\u201d within the meaning of c. 93A, \u00a7 9 (1), as appearing in St. 1979, c. 406, \u00a7 l.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> See <em>Leardi, </em>394 Mass, at 158. This court\u2019s decision in <em>Leardi </em>has been a source of some confusion in the years since 1985. The confusion appears to stem from the following language:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b520-6\">\u201c[Ujnder circumstances where there has been an invasion of a legally protected interest, but no harm for which actual damages can be awarded, we conclude that the statute provides for the recovery of minimum damages in the amount of $25. . . . [I]n amending G. L. c. 93A, [\u00a7] 9, the Legislature exercised its prerogative to create a legal right, the invasion of which, without more, constitutes an injury.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b520-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 160. Later decisions of this court have interpreted the <em>Leardi </em>case and the language quoted here in different ways.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>Nevertheless, our recent decisions generally establish the following. The invasion of a consumer\u2019s legal right (a right, for example, established by statute or regulation), without more, may be a violation of G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 2, and even a per se violation of \u00a7 2, but the fact that there is such a violation does not necessarily mean the consumer has suffered an injury or a loss entitling her to at least nominal damages and attorney\u2019s fees; instead, the violation of the legal right that has created the unfair or deceptive act or practice must cause the consumer some kind of separate, identifiable harm arising from the violation itself.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> See <em>Rhodes </em>v. <em>AIG Dom. Claims, Inc., </em>461 Mass. 486, 496 n.16 (2012) (Rhodes); <em>Casavant </em>v. <em>Norwegian Cruise Line Ltd., </em>460 Mass. 500, 504-505 (2011) (Casavant); <em>Ian-nacchino </em>v. <em>Ford Motor Co., </em>451 Mass. 623, 632-633 (2008) (Iannacchino); <em>Hershenow </em>v. <em>Enterprise Rent-A-Car Co. of Boston, </em>445 Mass. 790, 801-802 (2006) (Hershenow). To the extent that the quoted passage from <em>Leardi </em>can be read to signify that \u201cinvasion\u201d of a consumer plaintiff\u2019s established legal right in a manner that qualifies as an unfair or deceptive act under G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 2, automatically entitles the plaintiff to at least nominal damages (and attorney\u2019s fees), we do not follow the <em>Leardi </em>decision. Rather, as the <em>Rhodes, Casavant, Iannacchino, </em>and <em>Hershenow </em>decisions indicate, a plaintiff bringing an action for damages under c. 93A, \u00a7 9, must allege and ultimately prove that she has, as a result, suffered a distinct injury or harm that arises from the claimed unfair or deceptive act itself.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b521-5\">Returning to \u00a7 105 <em>(a), </em>there appear to be at least two types of injury or harm that might in theory be caused by a merchant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>violation of the statute: the actual receipt by a consumer of unwanted marketing materials as a result of the merchant\u2019s unlawful collection of the consumer\u2019s personal identification information;<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> and the merchant\u2019s sale of a customer\u2019s personal identification information or the data obtained from that information to a third party.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> When a merchant acquires personal identification information in violation of \u00a7 105 <em>(a) </em>and uses the information for its own business purposes, whether by sending the customer unwanted marketing materials or by selling the information for a profit, the merchant has caused the consumer an injury that is distinct from the statutory violation itself and cognizable under G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 9.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b522-5\">3. <em>Meaning of \u201ccredit card transaction form. \u201d </em>The third question asks whether the term \u201ccredit card transaction form\u201d in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>\u00a7 105 (a) should be understood to refer equally to electronic and paper transaction forms.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b523-4\">Section 105 (a) provides that \u201c[n]o person . . . or . . . business entity that accepts a credit card for a business transaction shall write, cause to be written or require that a credit card holder write personal identification information ... on the credit card transaction form.\u201d G. L. c. 93, \u00a7 105 <em>(a). </em>The section affirmatively declares that its provisions \u201cshall apply to <em>all </em>credit card transactions\u201d (emphasis supplied), and it contains no language expressly limiting a \u201ccredit card transaction form\u201d to a paper form. Accordingly, as noted by the judge, the language of \u00a7 105 <em>(a) </em>naturally appears to include all such transactions, whether they are processed manually or electronically. The reference to the verb \u201cwrite\u201d in \u00a7 105 (a) does not foreclose such an interpretation because by definition, the verb encompasses inscriptions made by hand and by typing. Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary 2640-2641 (1993) (defining \u201cwrite\u201d to include \u201cto form or produce [a legible character] in, upon, or by means of a suitable medium,\u201d \u201cto produce [symbols or words] by machine,\u201d and \u201cto form or produce letters, words, or sentences with a pen, pencil, or machine\u201d). See <em>Allen </em>v. <em>Boston Redev. Auth., </em>450 Mass. 242, 256 (2007) (\u201cWhere a statutory term is not defined, it must be understood in accordance with its generally accepted plain meaning\u201d); G. L. c. 4, \u00a7 6, Third (\u201cWords and phrases shall be construed according to the common and approved usage of the language\u201d). Based on the words chosen by the Legislature, therefore, we interpret \u201ccredit card transaction form\u201d to apply to transactions involving both electronic and paper forms.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b523-5\">There are other reasons to reject a narrow interpretation of the statutory language advocated by Michaels. To construe \u00a7 105 <em>(a) </em>as inapplicable to electronic credit card transactions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>would render the statute essentially obsolete in a world where paper credit card transactions are a rapidly vanishing event.

Such a construction would thus fail to carry out the statutory purpose of protecting consumer privacy because it would allow merchants to avoid the statute\u2019s prohibition against collecting personal identification information simply by using electronic means to capture and reflect any electronic credit card transaction.

No. 89, at a hearing before the Joint Committee on Commerce and Labor on April 1, 1991. State House News Service, April 1, 1991. The summary reports that at the hearing, a MASSPERG representative noted that most retailers still required personal information, including home telephone and address, to process credit card purchases. <em>Id. </em>The summary also notes that a public school teacher in Brookline described to the committee how his driver\u2019s license information written on his credit card receipt was used to purchase goods fraudulently in his name. <em>Id. </em>Finally, the summary indicates that a representative of the Retailers Association of Massachusetts defended the collection of some of the challenged information relating to consumers and noted that merchants need to protect themselves from credit card and check fraud. <em>Id. </em>Although the summary suggests that the proposed legislation, as perceived by testifying members of the public, may have had fraud prevention as one purpose, it does not offer persuasive evidence that fraud prevention was the sole legislative purpose underlying \u00a7 105 (a) specifically. Furthermore, the summary only describes select testimony of members of the public; it does not offer direct insight into what was on the minds of the legislators in drafting and ultimately enacting the legislation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b517-9\">We recognize that the certified question specifically asks whether a zip code qualifies as personal identification information <em>\u201cbecause </em>a [zip code] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>could be necessary to the credit card issuer to identify the card holder in order to complete the transaction\u201d (emphasis supplied). In answering the question, we do not focus on the specific reason assigned by the judge but, rather, address the question as asking more generally whether a zip code is \u201cpersonal identification information\u201d within the meaning of G.

Civ. Code \u00a7 1747.08 (2005) (\u00a7 1747.08), which, the court explained, was specifically aimed at protecting consumer privacy. <em>Pineda, </em>51 Cal. 4th at 534. Tyler posits that the similarity in language between \u00a7 1747.08 and \u00a7 105 <em>(a) </em>should render the California Supreme Court\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 1747.08 persuasive in interpreting \u00a7 105 <em>(a). </em>The District Court judge disagreed with Tyler about the import of the <em>Pineda </em>case and \u00a7 1747.08, stating that the Massachusetts Legislature intended \u00a7 105 <em>(a) </em>to have a much narrower purpose than its California counterpart. Senator Pines\u2019s legislative file relating to \u00a7 105 includes a legislative summary and copy of 1990 Assembly Bill No. 2920, the bill that ultimately was enacted by the California Legislature as \u00a7 1747.08. However, we do not find it necessary to decide what, if any, influence the California statute had on the Massachusetts legislators who enacted \u00a7 105 <em>(a) </em>in 1991, because, quite apart from the California statute, the available legislative history of \u00a7 105 <em>(a) </em>discloses that the legislative intent underlying it centered on protecting consumer privacy.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b520-8\">Prior to 1979, G.

Nonetheless, receipt of unwanted marketing material as a result of a \u00a7 105 <em>(a) </em>violation represents an invasion of the consumer\u2019s personal privacy causing injury or harm worth more than a penny, and the consumer is thus entitled to the minimum statutory damage award of twenty-five dollars under G.

The issue of damages becomes more complicated where a merchant sells a consumer\u2019s personal identification information acquired in a manner violating \u00a7 105 <em>(a), </em>because the harm comes from the merchant\u2019s disclosure of the consumer\u2019s private information on the open market, not from a direct assault on her privacy. Disgorgement of the merchant\u2019s profits may provide an appropriate means of calculating damages in the latter situation, both because it is a close approximation of the value of the consumer\u2019s personal identification information on the open market and because such a damage award would remove any financial incentive to merchants to violate the statute. For a single consumer, the amount of damages for such an injury also would likely amount to less than twenty-five dollars, thus triggering the minimum damage award provided by G.
