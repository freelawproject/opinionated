L. c. 40B, \u00a7\u00a7 20-23, to build five three-story buildings with 150 rental apartments (project). The board denied the application, and Sugarbush appealed the denial to the housing appeals committee (HAC) of the Department of Housing and Community Development (department). The HAC vacated the board\u2019s decision and directed the board to issue a comprehensive permit. The board appealed to the Superior Court under G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14, which affirmed the HAC\u2019s decision, and we granted the board\u2019s application for direct appellate review.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-12\">On appeal, the board claims that the HAC made five errors. First, the board contends that the HAC erred in concluding that the availability of low-cost, market-rate rental housing in the town of Sunderland (town) should not be considered in determining the regional need for low and moderate income housing, and in defining the region as the six-town area including and surrounding Sunderland. Second, the board argues that there was not substantial evidence to support the HAC\u2019s finding that the regional need for low and moderate income housing outweighed concerns regarding the safety of the future occupants of the proposed housing development in the event of fire (and of the fire fighters fighting such a fire). Third, the board claims the HAC erred in concluding that the town need not acquire a ladder fire truck if the project were built and that other more general claims of adverse fiscal impact arising from the project, such as increased educational, police, and fire fighting costs, may not be considered in evaluating whether the denial of project approval is consistent with local needs under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>G. L. c. 40B, \u00a7 23. Fourth, the board maintains that the HAC erred in concluding that Sugarbush established a prima facie case that the project complies with the town\u2019s wetlands bylaw. Fifth, the board argues that the HAC erred in ordering the board to refund the $10,000 fee it assessed Sugarbush to pay for the services of the board\u2019s legal counsel. We address each claim in turn and affirm the judgment of the Superior Court affirming the HAC\u2019s decision.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b186-5\"><em>Legal background and standard of review. </em>Before addressing the particular legal and factual issues before us in this case, we describe briefly the history, purpose, and operation of the Massachusetts comprehensive permit act, sometimes referred to as the anti-snob zoning act, G. L. c. 40B, \u00a7\u00a7 20-23 (act). <em>Zoning Bd. of Appeals of Wellesley </em>v. <em>Ardemore Apartments Ltd. Partnership, </em>436 Mass. 811, 814 (2002) <em>(Wellesley II). </em>See <em>Zoning Bd. of Appeals of Lunenburg </em>v. <em>Housing Appeals Comm., ante </em>38, 39-44 (2013). \u201cWe have long recognized that the Legislature\u2019s intent in enacting [the act] is \u2018to provide relief from exclusionary zoning practices which prevented the construction of badly needed low and moderate income housing\u2019 in the Commonwealth.\u201d <em>Standerwick </em>v. <em>Zoning Bd. of Appeals of Andover, </em>447 Mass. 20, 28-29 (2006), quoting <em>Board of Appeals of Hanover </em>v. <em>Housing Appeals Comm., </em>363 Mass. 339, 354 (1973). \u201cThe structure of the act itself reflects a \u2018careful balance between leaving to local authorities their well-recognized autonomy generally to establish local zoning requirements . . . while foreclosing municipalities from obstructing the building of a minimum level of housing affordable to persons of low income.\u2019 \u201d <em>Zoning Bd. of Appeals of Amesbury </em>v. <em>Housing Appeals Comm., </em>457 Mass. 748, 763-764 (2010), quoting <em>Board of Appeals of Woburn </em>v. <em>Housing Appeals Comm., </em>451 Mass. 581, 584 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b186-6\">The act allows a public agency, or a limited dividend or nonprofit organization, that wishes to construct low or moderate income housing \u201cto circumvent the often arduous process of applying to multiple local boards for individual permits and, instead, to apply to the local board of appeals for issuance of a single comprehensive permit.\u201d <em>Board of Appeals of Woburn </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number><em>Housing Appeals Comm., supra </em>at 583, quoting <em>Middleborough </em>v. <em>Housing Appeals Comm., </em>449 Mass. 514, 516 (2007). See G. L. c. 40B, \u00a7 21 (organization \u201cmay submit to the board of appeals ... a single application to build such housing in lieu of separate applications to the applicable local boards\u201d). \u201cThe zoning board is then to notify those \u2018local boards\u2019 for their \u2018recommendations\u2019 on the proposal; the zoning board may \u2018request the appearance\u2019 of representatives of those \u2018local boards\u2019 at the public hearing as may be \u2018necessary or helpful\u2019 to the decision on the proposal; and the zoning board may \u2018take into consideration the recommendations of the local boards\u2019 when making its decision.\u201d <em>Dennis Housing Corp. </em>v. <em>Zoning Bd. of Appeals of Dennis, </em>439 Mass. 71, 77 (2003), quoting G. L. c. 40B, \u00a7 21. The zoning board has \u201cthe same power to issue permits or approvals as any local board or official who would otherwise act with respect to such application.\u201d G. L. c. 40B, \u00a7 21.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-5\">\u201cIf the board denies an application for a comprehensive permit, the developer may appeal to HAC.\u201d <em>Zoning Bd. of Appeals of Wellesley </em>v. <em>Housing Appeals Comm., </em>385 Mass. 651, 656 (1982) <em>(Wellesley I), </em>citing G. L. c. 40B, \u00a7 22. When the HAC reviews the decision of a local zoning board of appeals to deny a comprehensive permit, \u201c[t]he hearing . . . shall be limited to the issue of whether ... the decision of the board of appeals was reasonable and consistent with local needs.\u201d G. L. c. 40B, \u00a7 23.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> See 760 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 56.07(l)(b) (2012) (\u201cIn the case of the denial of a Comprehensive Permit, the issue shall be whether the decision of the Board was Consistent with Local Needs\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b187-6\">\u201cConsistent with local needs\u201d is a term of art under G. L. c. 40B, \u00a7 20, defined as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b187-7\">\u201c[Requirements and regulations shall be considered consistent with local needs if they are reasonable in view of the regional need for low and moderate income housing considered with the number of low income persons in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>city or town affected and the need to protect the health or safety of the occupants of the proposed housing or of the residents of the city or town, to promote better site and building design in relation to the surroundings, or to preserve open spaces, and if such requirements and regulations are applied as equally as possible to both subsidized and unsubsidized housing.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b188-4\">The statute further provides that such requirements and regulations \u201cshall be consistent with local needs . . . where . . . low or moderate income housing exists which is in excess of ten per cent of the housing units reported in the latest federal decennial census of the city or town or on sites comprising one and one half per cent or more of the total land area zoned for residential, commercial or industrial use.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b188-5\">Under the regulations issued by the department to administer the act, there is an \u201cirrebuttable presumption\u201d that a board\u2019s decision to deny an application for a comprehensive permit is \u201c[consistent with [l]ocal [n]eeds\u201d where the board determines that one or more of the grounds set forth in 760 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 56.03(1) (2012) has been satisfied. 760 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 56.07(3)(a), 56.07(2)(b)(l) (2012). One of these grounds is that the town\u2019s subsidized housing inventory (SHI) exceeds ten percent of the town\u2019s total housing units. 760 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 56.03(1), 56.03(3)(a) (2012). Where this or any of the other grounds in 760 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 56.03(1) is established, the \u201cHAC is without authority to order that board to grant a comprehensive permit or to modify or remove conditions,\u201d and the board\u2019s denial of an application must be affirmed. <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>Housing Appeals Comm., </em>451 Mass. 149, 151-152 (2008) (\u201cif a municipality has reached the ten per cent threshold, and its zoning board of appeals denies a developer\u2019s application, then the application process is effectively terminated\u201d); 760 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 56.07(3)(a). There is no dispute that the town has failed to prove any of these grounds.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b188-21\">Where, as here, none of the grounds that would trigger a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>conclusive presumption is present, the regulations and our cases provide that there is \u201ca rebuttable presumption that there is a substantial Housing Need which outweighs Local Concerns.\u201d 760 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 56.07(3)(a) (2012). See <em>Boothroyd </em>v. <em>Zoning Bd. of Appeals of Amherst, </em>449 Mass. 333, 340 (2007), quoting <em>Board of Appeals of Hanover </em>v. <em>Housing Appeals Comm., supra </em>at 367 (\u201cmunicipality\u2019s failure to meet its minimum [affordable] housing obligations, as defined in \u00a7 20, will provide compelling evidence that the regional need for housing does in fact outweigh the objections to the proposal\u201d). Where a town attempts to rebut this presumption, the board bears \u201cthe burden of proving, first, that there is a valid health, safety, environmental, design, open space, or other Local Concern which supports such denial, and then, that such Local Concern outweighs the Housing Need.\u201d 760 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 56.07(2)(b)(2) (2012). See <em>Board of Appeals of Hanover </em>v. <em>Housing Appeals Comm., supra </em>(\u201cIn cases where the locality has not met its minimum housing obligations, the board must rest its decision on whether the required need for low and moderate income housing outweighs the valid planning objections to the details of the proposal such as health, site design, and open spaces\u201d).* ***<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b190-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>Under G. L. c. 40B, \u00a7 22, the HAC\u2019s decision may be reviewed in the Superior Court under G. L. c. 30A, which in turn provides that the court may set aside the decision of the agency \u201cif it determines that the substantial rights of any party may have been prejudiced because the agency decision is . . . [ujnsupported by substantial evidence; or . . . otherwise not in accordance with law.\u201d G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14(7). See <em>Wellesley I, supra </em>at 657 (\u201cdecision of HAC must be upheld if it is supported by substantial evidence,\u201d which is \u201csuch evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion\u201d). In this analysis, we give \u201cdue weight to the experience, technical competence, and specialized knowledge of the agency, as well as to the discretionary authority conferred upon it,\u201d G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14 (7), and we \u201capply all rational presumptions in favor of the validity of the administrative action.\u201d <em>Middleborough </em>v. <em>Housing Appeals Comm., </em>449 Mass. 514, 524 (2007), quoting <em>Wellesley I, supra </em>at 654. \u201cA court may not displace an administrative board\u2019s choice between two fairly conflicting views, even though the court would justifiably have made a different choice had the matter been before it de novo.\u201d <em>Wellesley I, supra </em>at 657, quoting <em>Labor Relations Comm\u2019n </em>v. <em>University Hosp., Inc., </em>359 Mass. 516, 521 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b190-5\"><em>Discussion. </em>1. <em>Calculating the regional need for low and moderate income housing. </em>The board contends that the HAC erred in refusing to consider the availability of low-cost, market-rate, unsubsidized housing in the town in weighing the town\u2019s local concerns against the housing need. The town points to testimony from its expert, Richard Heaton, that the town has \u201cone of the highest percentages of rental housing\u201d in the Commonwealth, that \u201c83% of all existing rental housing units in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>Sunderland are being rented at affordable rents, even though they may not be subsidized,\u201d and that forty-six per cent of Sunder-land\u2019s housing stock is rented at \u201caffordable\u201d prices as designated by the department. We conclude that the HAC did not err in excluding housing that is not subsidized by the Federal or State government in weighing the regional need for affordable housing. See <em>Zoning Bd. of Appeals of Lunenburg </em>v. <em>Housing Appeals Comm., ante </em>38, 44-48 (2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b191-5\">The board\u2019s argument fails because it conflicts with the plain meaning of the language of the act. Under G. L. c. 40B, \u00a7 20, housing need is effectively defined as \u201cthe regional need for low and moderate income housing considered with the number of low income persons in the city or town affected,\u201d because that is the factor that is to be considered in determining whether local requirements or regulations are \u201cconsistent with local needs.\u201d This definition is made explicit in the department\u2019s regulations, where \u201c[h]ousing [n]eed\u201d is defined using almost the exact same language. 760 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 56.02 (2012).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The act defines \u201c[flow or moderate income housing\u201d to mean \u201cany housing <em>subsidized by the federal or state government </em>under any program to assist the construction of low or moderate income housing as defined in the applicable federal or state statute, whether built or operated by any public agency or any nonprofit or limited dividend organization\u201d (emphasis added). G. L. c. 40B, \u00a7 20. Therefore, the plain text of both the act and the governing regulations require the HAC, in weighing the housing need, to exclude from consideration any affordable housing that is not subsidized under a qualifying government-sponsored program. See <em>Wellesley I, supra </em>at 654.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b191-6\">This interpretation is in harmony with the purpose of the act. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>The act was originally drafted to address \u201can acute shortage of <em>decent, safe, </em>low and moderate cost housing throughout the commonwealth\u201d (emphasis added). <em>Board of Appeals of Hanover </em>v. <em>Housing Appeals Comm., </em>363 Mass. 339, 351 (1973). Some market rate housing may be affordable because the units are neither decent nor safe. Other affordable market rate housing units may be both decent and safe, but may be affordable only temporarily because of a weak housing market. As the housing market strengthens, there is no way to ensure that rental payments for market rate housing units may not rise to levels that would be unaffordable to low or moderate income households, either because of over-all rising rental prices or because landlords decide to improve or enlarge the units. Nor is there any way to ensure that affordable units in market rate housing projects will be limited in availability to low or moderate income households, especially where the town attracts many students living off-campus from the University of Massachusetts in nearby Amherst.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-5\">In contrast, precisely because such housing is subsidized by a Federal or State government or agency under a program to assist the construction of affordable housing, see note 7, <em>supra, </em>housing that would address the \u201cregional need for low and moderate income housing\u201d under G. L. c. 40B, \u00a7 20, typically must satisfy minimum requirements designed to ensure the quality of the housing and the reasonableness of the rental rate.* ****<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Furthermore, unless the statute or regulation applying to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>subsidizing agency in question provides otherwise, occupancy of subsidized affordable low or moderate income housing units under the department\u2019s comprehensive permit regulations is restricted to \u201cincome eligible households,\u201d defined as households \u201cwhose maximum income does not exceed 80% of the area median income, adjusted for household size.\u201d 760 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 56.02. These \u201c[u]se [restrictions\u201d are accomplished through deed restrictions or other legally binding instruments that run with the land. <em>Id. </em>They are recorded at the registry of deeds, and they limit occupancy \u201cduring the term of affordability\u201d established in a construction subsidy agreement. <em>Id. </em>760 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 56.05(13) (2012).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Also, in order to be included on the SHI, subsidized affordable rental housing units must be leased under an \u201caffirmative fair marketing plan\u201d that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>provides for a lottery or other resident selection process and \u201ceffective outreach to protected groups underrepresented in the municipality.\u201d 760 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7\u00a7 56.02 (defining \u201cAffirmative Fair Marketing Plan\u201d and providing that \u201c[i]t shall be the responsibility of the Subsidizing Agency to enforce compliance with provisions of 760 [Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7] 56.00 and applicable Department guidelines relating to matters including Affirmative Fair Marketing Plans . . . and Use Restrictions\u201d). Department of Housing and Community Development, Comprehensive Permit Guidelines \u00a7 11(A)(1) (July 30, 2008) (comprehensive permit guidelines) (\u201caffordable housing units shall be subject to an Affirmative Fair Marketing and Resident Selection Plan that, at a minimum, meets the requirements set out in the following Section III, Affirmative Fair Housing Marketing Plan\u201d).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> In light of these differences between subsidized affordable housing units and unsubsidized market-rate units, we agree with the HAC that \u201cthe [Ljegislature required a state or federal subsidy in order to ensure that housing constructed under the law would be subject to enforceable controls on quality, sales price or rental rate, manner of marketing, and income of the occupants \u2014 all factors essential to the long term stability of affordable housing.\u201d Therefore, where none of the conclusive presumptions in favor of the board\u2019s denial of the comprehensive permit application applies, we hold that only housing that is actually \u201csubsidized by the [Fjederal or [Sjtate government\u201d under a qualifying program may be counted in evaluating whether the regional need for low or moderate income housing is outweighed by local concerns. See G. L. c. 40B, \u00a7 20.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-5\">In this case, the HAC defined the pertinent \u201cregion\u201d by which to measure the regional need for low and moderate income housing to include the town and the five nearby towns of Amherst, Deerfield, Hadley, Montague, and Whatley, as proposed by Sugarbush\u2019s expert, Lynne D. Sweet, rather than the fifty-five municipalities within a twenty-mile radius of the town, as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>proposed by the board, which would include the cities of Springfield, Northampton, Holyoke, and Chicopee. The word \u201cregion\u201d is not defined in either the act or the regulations; furthermore, neither the act nor the regulations provide any guidance as to how to determine the relevant region to be used in evaluating the regional need for low and moderate income housing. In the absence of such guidance, the HAC must exercise its discretion in determining the appropriate \u201cregion.\u201d See <em>Hastings </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>424 Mass. 46, 49 (1997), quoting <em>Arthurs </em>v. <em>Board of Registration in Med., </em>383 Mass. 299, 312-313 (1981) (\u201cIt is a recognized principle of administrative law that an agency may adopt policies through adjudication as well as through rulemaking, . . . and \u2018the choice made between proceeding by general rule or by individual, ad hoc litigation is one that lies primarily in the informed discretion of the administrative agency\u2019 \u201d).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b195-5\">Giving the appropriate deference to the HAC, we hold that its determination that the six-town region identified by Sweet is the appropriate region was supported by substantial evidence. Sweet testified that she established the six-town region based on the National Council of Affordable Housing Market Analysts standards \u201cfor examining supply and demand for the need for housing.\u201d The alternative proposed by the board was derived solely from a literal interpretation of Sweet\u2019s oral testimony, where she described the six-town region as \u201ccover[ing] about a 20-mile radius.\u201d The board argued that, if the town were the focal point, a twenty-mile radius would include fifty-five municipalities. It was within the HAC\u2019s discretion to find that the region should not be measured by that radius but by a generally accepted standard applied by affordable housing market analysts and supported by the balance of Sweet\u2019s expert testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-6\">We further conclude that there was substantial evidence to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>support the HAC\u2019s finding of a \u201csubstantial regional housing need\u201d based on the limited availability of low and moderate income housing subsidized by the Federal or State government within the six-town region. The department\u2019s records revealed that the town had only six affordable units of housing listed on the SHI, less than 0.4 per cent of its over-all housing stock, and that the six towns in the region had an overall SHI percentage of less than nine percent.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> In addition, Sweet testified that the three housing authorities in the six-town region had 434 residents waiting for public housing, with a wait of between two and five years for family units.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-5\">2. <em>Fire safety concerns. </em>One of the categories of local concern that must be weighed by the HAC against the housing need in deciding whether the board\u2019s denial of the comprehensive permit application is \u201cconsistent with local needs\u201d is \u201cthe need to protect the health or safety of the occupants of the proposed housing or of the residents of the city or town.\u201d G. L. c. 40B, \u00a7 20. See 760 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 56.07(3)(b) (2012) (among other factors, \u201cweight of the Local Concern will be commensurate with the degree to which the health and safety of occupants or municipal residents is imperiled\u201d). Therefore, the safety of the project residents and local fire fighters in the event of a fire at the project is properly a local concern that must be weighed by the HAC. The HAC weighed these safety concerns, and concluded that the board \u201cfailed to meet its burden of establishing a specific local fire-safety concern . . . that outweighs the regional need for housing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b197-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>At the HAC hearing, the town\u2019s fire chief, Robert T. Aheam, testified on behalf of the board that the height of each of the proposed buildings in the project is approximately forty-two feet, and that the town lacks the equipment needed to obtain access to the roof in the event of a \u201cstructural fire,\u201d because it does not possess a ladder track and its largest ground ladder has a maximum height of thirty-five feet. Chief Ahem asserted, \u201cIn combating any structural fire, it is a universally accepted practice and absolutely essential we obtain quick and efficient access to ... all the portions of the roof so as to create the necessary ventilation to allow for the escape of heat and smoke.\u201d \u201cWithout access to the roof,\u201d he opined, \u201cthere is ... a substantially increased risk of severe injury or death of residents or firefighting personnel.\u201d The fire chief acknowledged that \u201csprinklers provide a benefit\u201d but noted that, \u201cin a raging fire in a wood-framed building, sprinklers alone are insufficient to put the flames out.\u201d He also declared that a fire department must prepare for \u201ca worst case scenario,\u201d which would include a partial or complete failure of a sprinkler system. The chief also acknowledged that the neighboring town of Amherst possesses a ladder track, but he testified that mutual aid from another municipality\u2019s fire department \u201cmust be viewed as a last resort,\u201d and such aid would never be viewed by a fire professional as \u201ca primary means of combating a fire.\u201d He concluded that the project should not be built unless the town fire department is provided with a ladder track and a garage to store it, which the town financially cannot afford,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> and that he \u201cwould not be able to endorse the Project\u201d in light of what he characterized as \u201cdesign flaws.\u201d Walter B. Adams, who is a registered architect, a licensed construction supervisor, and a certified building official, also testified for the board, stating that the town\u2019s fire chief has \u201cthe authority under the building code to refuse the approval of a building permit submission if it is found that the submitted design does not provide acceptable Building and site access for fire fighting and/or rescue vehicle(s) and personnel.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b197-5\">Sugarbush offered the testimony of Mark B. Darnold, a registered professional civil engineer, who testified that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>town of Amherst\u2019s forty-eight-foot long aerial platform fire truck could respond to a fire at the project, could reach the roofs of the housing complex, and \u201ccould safely maneuver through the site and access each of the proposed buildings.\u201d He opined that \u201cthe Project complies with [Fjederal or [Sjtate statutes or regulations and with generally recognized standards with regard to firefighting access.\u201d Sugarbush also offered expert testimony from engineer Kevin S. Hastings, who stated that the presence of alternative safety measures, including a state-of-the-art sprinkler system and the availability of fire departments of surrounding communities to provide assistance, ensures that the buildings \u201cdo not represent an unusual fire or life safety hazard which would require a ladder truck.\u201d He concluded that \u201cthe proposed project will comply with Federal, State and local codes relating to fire safety and good fire safety practices\u201d and that, with the project\u2019s sprinkler system, the \u201coverall level of occupant and fire fighter safety\u201d will be greater in the proposed buildings than in a building that meets the town\u2019s thirty-five-foot height limitation in residential zoning districts but lacks such sprinkler protection.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-5\">The HAC noted that the most common sprinkler system proposed in previous projects it had reviewed was designed to protect the lives of the building\u2019s occupants but the system proposed here was more extensive, including sprinkler heads in attics and other concealed spaces, and therefore provided \u201cgreater protection for the building itself.\u201d It also found that, while it is unlikely that the town of Amherst\u2019s ladder truck can be counted on as a first responder to a fire at the project, it appeared that it would be available to assist in the type of multi-alarm, mutual aid emergency that may require ventilation of the roof to fight a structural fire. It also noted that the town, by special permit issued by the planning board, allows a building height of forty-five feet for multiple story buildings in planned unit developments in the town\u2019s residential and commercial districts, which suggests an acknowledgment by the town that a building may be as tall as forty-five feet and potentially still be safe even though the town has no ladder truck. We conclude that each of these factual findings was supported by substantial evidence.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"Aq0\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>The board claims that Sugarbush failed to establish a prima facie case that its proposal complied with State statutes and regulations, contending that it violated the State building code (code) with respect to fire safety.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The code in effect when the HAC issued its decision on June 21, 2010, was the seventh edition, 780 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7\u00a7 1.00-120.00 (2009), which required a building official before issuing a building permit to transmit \u201cthe fire protection construction documents (780 [Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7] 901.7.1.1) and building construction documents\u201d to the local fire chief \u201cfor review and approval of the items specified in 780 [Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7] 901.7.1.1.\u201d 780 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 901.7.2 (2008). The items specified in 780 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 901.7.1.1 (2008) concern the design and construction of fire protection systems, such as automatic sprinkler systems, smoke control and exhaust systems, and emergency alarm systems, but also include \u201c[b]uilding and site access for fire fighting and/or rescue vehicle(s) and personnel.\u201d 780 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 901.7.1.1(2) (2008). The board contends that where, as here, fire fighters cannot gain access to the roof of a proposed building without a ladder truck that the town does not possess, a fire chief may not approve the fire protection construction documents and a building permit may not issue because the construction of such a building would violate the code. We do not interpret the provision of the code requiring \u201cbuilding . . . access for fire fighting . . . personnel\u201d to declare <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>that a building is in violation where its roof cannot be accessed by any ladder possessed by the local fire department. Nor do we interpret this provision to suggest that a fire chief must refuse to approve the fire protection construction documents where his department does not have a ladder truck that would allow fire fighter access to the roof of the proposed building.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b200-5\">A fire chief does not have unbridled discretion effectively to deny a comprehensive permit by refusing to approve fire construction documents based on the height of a proposed building and the absence of a town ladder truck. In the context of a comprehensive permit application, the board has \u201cthe same power to issue permits or approvals as any local board or official who would otherwise act with respect to such application, including but not limited to the power to attach to said permit or approval conditions and requirements with respect to height, site plan, size or shape, or building materials.\u201d G. L. c. 40B, \u00a7 21. Under both the seventh and the presently-applicable eighth editions of the code, the fire chief reports the result of his review of construction documents to the \u201cbuilding official,\u201d 780 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 901.7.2 (2008) (seventh edition); 780 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 107.1.2 (2010) (eighth edition), and it is the building official who is the \u201cofficer or other designated authority charged with the administration and enforcement of [the code].\u201d 780 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 202 (2009).<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Therefore, in the context of a comprehensive permit application, just as the building official is a \u201c[l]ocal [b]oard\u201d within the definition of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>G. L. c. 40B, \u00a7 20,<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> the fire chief is a \u201clocal board or official who would otherwise act with respect to such application,\u201d and the board in reviewing such application has the \u201csame power to issue . . . approvals\u201d as the fire chief. G. L. c. 40B, \u00a7 21. See <em>Dennis Hous. Corp. </em>v. <em>Zoning Bd. of Appeals of Dennis, </em>439 Mass. 71, 79 (2003) (\u201c[i]t would be anomalous to hold that the zoning board\u2019s powers in the comprehensive permit scheme include the powers held by the building inspector in enforcing local requirements, but not the powers of the local agency for which the building inspector functions as enforcer\u201d). Since the HAC has the same power to issue permits or approvals as the board, the HAC has the authority to evaluate the fire chief\u2019s recommendation in the context of the comprehensive permit. 760 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 56.07(6)(b) (2012). See <em>Zoning Bd. of Appeals of Groton </em>v. <em>Housing Appeals Comm., </em>451 Mass. 35, 40 (2008).<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b202-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>We conclude that the HAC\u2019s determination that the board failed to meet its burden of establishing that the fire safety concern outweighs the regional need for low and moderate income housing was supported by substantial evidence.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> From the evidence before it, the HAC reasonably concluded that the additional risk to occupants and fire fighters created by the inability of fire fighters to gain direct access to the roof of the buildings with the ladders possessed by the town\u2019s fire department was minimal in light of the advanced sprinkler system to be installed in the buildings, which would diminish the risk of a structural fire that would require ventilation of the roof, and the likelihood that, should such a structural fire occur despite the sprinkler system, a ladder truck would be made available through mutual aid from the adjoining town of Amherst. Furthermore, it was not unreasonable for the HAC to be skeptical of the fire chief\u2019s testimony that a building is unsafe if its roof can only be reached with a ladder truck where the town\u2019s zoning bylaw allowed a building height of forty-five feet by special permit, even if no such permit had yet been issued.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Finally, where, as here, the HAC heard competing experts, \u201c[i]t is for the agency, not the reviewing court, to weigh credibility of witnesses and resolve factual disputes involving contradictory testimony.\u201d <em>MacLean </em>v. <em>Board of Registration in Nursing, </em>458 Mass. 1028, 1030 (2011), quoting <em>Duggan </em>v. <em>Board of Registration in Nursing, </em>456 Mass. 666, 674 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b202-5\">3. <em>Fiscal impact. </em>At the HAC hearing, town administrator <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>Margaret Nartowicz testified that the project would increase the town\u2019s population and over-all housing stock by approximately nine per cent, and that it would be \u201cnecessary\u201d to hire two additional police officers at an average yearly salary of $38,000 per officer and two additional fire fighters/emergency medical technicians at an average salary of $36,000. In addition, she testified that the project would likely increase the town\u2019s school age population by fifty-four children and, at a conservative estimate cost of $8,193 per student in the system, even one-half this number of additional school-aged children would pose a serious problem to the funding of the town\u2019s educational services. She opined that these additional expenses, along with the purchase of a ladder truck, the construction of a garage to house the truck, and unspecified additional maintenance expenses for roads, sidewalks, and drainage in the area of the development and along nearby Route 116, would far exceed the expected tax revenue from the project of $225,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-5\">The HAC granted Sugarbush\u2019s motion for summary decision as to this issue, concluding that the board could not justify its denial of the comprehensive permit based on the burdens the project would pose on municipal services and infrastructure because it failed to allege that these increased services or infrastructure were not technically or financially feasible, or that they arose from unusual topographical, environmental, or other physical circumstances. We conclude that the HAC did not err in refusing to consider fiscal impact as a local concern that must be weighed against the housing need in determining, on balance, whether the board\u2019s denial of the comprehensive permit application was consistent with local needs.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-6\">As noted earlier, G. L. c. 40B, \u00a7 20, specifically provides the criteria that may be examined by the board and the HAC in determining whether local requirements and regulations are consistent with local needs. Under the act, the regional need for low and moderate income housing is balanced against \u201cthe need to protect the health or safety of the occupants of the proposed housing or of the residents of the city or town, to promote better site and building design in relation to the surroundings, or to preserve open spaces.\u201d G. L. c. 40B, \u00a7 20. Therefore, the plain text of the statute lends no support to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>argument that additional considerations unrelated to health or safety, site or building design, or open spaces may be considered in determining whether the \u201cdenial of the application . . . was reasonable and consistent with local needs.\u201d G. L. c. 40B, \u00a7\u00a7 20, 23. See <em>Standerwick </em>v. <em>Zoning Bd. of Appeals of Andover, </em>447 Mass. 20, 31 (2006) (\u201cinterest in the provision of critically needed affordable housing must be balanced against the statutorily authorized interests in the protection of the safety and health of the town\u2019s residents, development of improved site and building design, and preservation of open space\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b204-5\">The department allows fiscal impact to a town to be considered in only one circumstance: if a board\u2019s denial of a comprehensive permit is based on</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b204-6\">\u201cthe inadequacy of existing municipal services or infrastructure, the Board shall have the burden of proving that the installation of services adequate to meet local needs is not technically or financially feasible. Financial feasibility may be considered only where there is evidence of unusual topographical, environmental, or other physical circumstances which make the installation of the needed service prohibitively costly.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b204-7\">760 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 56.07(2)(b)(4) (2012). In short, the department has interpreted the specified statutory factors to include the financial unfeasibility of providing additional municipal services or infrastructure in the single, limited circumstance where the addition of such services would be prohibitively costly as a result of \u201cunusual . . . physical circumstances.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Where no such physical circumstances are present, the agency\u2019s interpretation bars the board and the HAC from considering the financial burden of additional municipal services or infrastructure. Giving proper deference to the department\u2019s interpretation of the statute it is charged with administering, we conclude that this regulation limiting the extent to which fiscal impact may be deemed a local concern is \u201cin harmony with the legislative mandate.\u201d <em>Berrios </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Welfare, </em>411 Mass. 587, 595 (1992) (where statute is ambiguous, agency\u2019s regulations \u201care not to be declared void unless their provisions cannot by any reasonable construction be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>interpreted in harmony with the legislative mandate\u201d). See <em>Goldberg </em>v. <em>Board of Health of Granby, </em>444 Mass. 627, 632633 (2005). When such unusual physical circumstances are not present, a town may address the alleged inadequacy of municipal services through conventional budget adjustments. But where installing additional municipal services or infrastructure is prohibitively costly due to unusual physical circumstances, the town may need to make extraordinary budget adjustments in order to provide the additional services, which may affect the \u201chealth or safety of the occupants of the proposed housing or of the residents of the city or town.\u201d G. L. c. 40B, \u00a7 20. Furthermore, by limiting the context in which fiscal burden may be considered, this regulation avoids the complex and difficult examination of whether affordable housing creates a net positive or negative impact on a town\u2019s economy and budget, and thus furthers the statutory purpose of \u201cprovid[ing] relief from exclusionary zoning practices which prevent[] the construction of badly needed low and moderate income housing.\u201d <em>Board of Appeals of Hanover </em>v. <em>Housing Appeals Comm., </em>363 Mass. 339, 354 (1973).<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AlN\">Here, the board made no showing that the need for additional municipal services in the form of more police, fire fighters, and educators, or from maintenance of nearby roads, sidewalks, and drainage areas, arose from any reason other than the number of additional residents anticipated to reside in the project. The only <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>municipal expense that would have arisen from the unusual physical circumstances of the project, specifically the height of its buildings, was the town\u2019s professed need for a ladder track and garage, but the HAC reasonably determined that the town need not incur this expense to ensure an appropriate level of lire safety. Where, as here, the adverse fiscal impact the town would allegedly suffer is based on the inadequacy of existing municipal services or infrastructure and does not derive from the unusual topographical, environmental, or other physical circumstances of the project, the HAC correctly determined that such impact may not be weighed in the \u201cconsistent with local needs\u201d balancing test. See 760 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 56.07(2)(b)(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b206-5\">4. <em>Wetlands protection. </em>Under \u00a7 122-2 of the town wetlands bylaw, apart from exceptions not applicable here, \u201cno person shall remove, fill, dredge, alter or build upon or within one hundred (100) feet\u201d of any wetland unless permitted by the town\u2019s conservation commission. The board, in denying the comprehensive permit, found that Sugarbush had failed to provide the proof that would be required by the town\u2019s conservation commission to conclude that the alterations proposed are consistent with the interests protected by the local wetlands bylaw.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> The HAC concluded that the board \u201cdoes not affirmatively even state that damage to wetlands will occur or describe that damage, much less prove that it will happen,\u201d and thus failed to show that local wetlands concerns outweigh the regional need for housing. We conclude that the HAC\u2019s decision was supported by substantial evidence.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b207-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>In the prehearing order, the board declared that it would \u201cshow that because of the property\u2019s propensity for flooding and the stormwater facilities\u2019 proximity to wetlands, the development will not adequately protect wetlands resource areas . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> Yet, at the hearing on the merits before the HAC, none of the town\u2019s experts testified that the project would adversely affect the wetlands or other protected areas on the property. Rather, Sugar-bush\u2019s expert, Michael J. Marcus, a senior scientist at a \u201cfull service environmental consulting company,\u201d testified that \u201c[t]he proposed work within the 100 foot wetland buffer zone complies with both local and state wetland regulations for work within a wetland buffer zone.\u201d Where, as here, the board accepted the burden to show that the development will not adequately protect wetlands and failed to meet that burden, the HAC was supported by substantial evidence in so finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-5\">5. <em>Application fee to pay board\u2019s legal counsel. </em>Under the town\u2019s comprehensive permit rules, as part of the application, the developer must pay a primary filing fee of $1,000 plus $50 per housing unit (in this case, $8,500); a $5,000 fee to retain a financial consultant; and, where the proposed project exceeds 75 units, an additional fee of $10,000 \u201cto pay for the services of [the board\u2019s] legal counsel for assistance.\u201d Comprehensive Permit Rules of the Board \u00a7 3.02 (2006). Sugarbush challenged only the $10,000 legal fee assessed as a filing fee.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-6\">Under the department\u2019s regulations, a board \u201cmay require the payment of a reasonable filing fee with the application ... to defray the direct costs of processing applications, and taking into consideration the statutory goal of [G.

Where a board determines that it needs technical advice to review a comprehensive permit application, it may also require the applicant to pay a reasonable fee to retain outside consultants. 760 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 56.05(5) (2012). The latter regulation, however, clearly states, \u201cLegal fees for general representation of the Board or other Local Boards shall not be imposed on the Applicant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The HAC found that the $10,000 legal fee assessed here was distinct from the general filing fee of $8,500 and was not a reasonable filing fee under \u00a7 56.05(2), but was instead \u201ca fee for general legal representation that is prohibited under our regulations and precedents.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b208-5\">The board contends that, because it retained counsel to assist the board with the many legal issues that arise in considering a \u00a7 40B application, and reasonably estimated the legal fee to be $10,000, the fee for legal services was not a consultant\u2019s fee under \u00a7 56.05(5) but a filing fee under \u00a7 56.05(2), reasonably assessed \u201cto defray the direct costs of processing applications.\u201d The board also contends that, even if the fee were a forbidden consultant fee, HAC did not have statutory jurisdiction to order a refund of this fee because, under G. L. c. 40B, \u00a7 23, the hearing \u201cshall be limited to the issue of whether, in the case of the denial of an application, the decision of the board of appeals was reasonable and consistent with local needs.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b208-6\">We conclude that the HAC had substantial evidence to determine that the $10,000 fee was a prohibited consultant fee for general legal representation. The HAC made clear that, in appropriate circumstances, where an attorney\u2019s specialized legal expertise is needed to review technical aspects of a proposal, such as title questions, a board may assess the legal fee as a consultant\u2019s fee under \u00a7 56.05(5). But it found that the legal fee here was for general legal representation by the board\u2019s special counsel who attended all the local hearings and represented the board in the appeal to the HAC. The board may not evade the regulatory prohibition against burdening the applicant with legal fees arising from the board\u2019s general representation simply by characterizing the legal fee as a filing fee, especially where it would be a second such fee above and beyond <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>the usual filing fee. We find that the HAC did not err in preventing its regulations from being so easily evaded.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AU\">Finally, we conclude that the HAC\u2019s jurisdiction includes the authority to ensure that developers seeking approval under the act to build low and moderate income housing are not assessed fees that are prohibited by its regulations. \u201cWhere the focus of the statutory enactment is one of reform, as is indisputably true of the act, . . . \u2018the administrative agency charged with its implementation should construe it broadly so as to further the goals of such reform.\u2019 \u201d <em>Zoning Bd. of Appeals of Amesbury </em>v. <em>Housing Appeals Comm., </em>457 Mass. 748, 761-762 (2010), quoting <em>Middleborough </em>v. <em>Housing Appeals Comm., </em>449 Mass. 514, 524 (2007). If the HAC lacked jurisdiction to remedy the imposition of an illegal fee, a board would be able to impose burdensome \u201capplication fees\u201d on G. L. c. 40B developers, and a developer whose application was denied would need to file two separate appeals: one with the HAC to challenge the denial of the application, and another in the Superior Court in the form of a declaratory action to determine whether the board had the authority to require the fee. We conclude that the \u201cconsequences of this dual system of review could be devastating in terms of costs and delays, and the creation of new affordable housing would be impeded or even prevented by such a tedious process.\u201d <em>Zoning Bd. of Appeals of Amesbury </em>v. <em>Housing Appeals Comm., supra </em>at 761. \u201cIn addition to streamlining the permitting process, the Legislature sought to \u2018promote affordable housing by minimizing lengthy and expensive delays occasioned by court battles commenced by those seeking to exclude affordable housing from their own neighborhoods.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id., </em>quoting <em>Standerwick </em>v. <em>Zoning Bd. of Appeals of Andover, </em>447 Mass. 20, 29 (2006). Given this purpose, we do not understand the Legislature in limiting the issues to be decided at an HAC hearing in G. L. c. 40B, \u00a7 23, to have intended that the HAC would be unable to enforce its own rules limiting the amount of filing fees and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>that an applicant would need to expend the time and money to bring a separate action to remedy the regulatory violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-4\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b186-7\">We acknowledge the amicus briefs of the Association to Preserve Cape Cod; the Citizens\u2019 Housing and Planning Association; and Walter R.
