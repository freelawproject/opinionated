L. c. 91 (chapter 91 license) to the Boston Redevelopment Authority (BRA) to redevelop a section of land owned by the BRA on the seaward end of Long Wharf (project site). The plaintiffs, ten residents of Boston\u2019s North End neighborhood, appealed the issuance of the chapter 91 license to the department\u2019s office of appeals and dispute resolution, and ultimately to a judge in the Superior Court, claiming the department acted unconstitutionally and beyond its statutory authority when it issued the chapter 91 license without obtaining a two-thirds vote of the Legislature as required by art. 97 of the Amendments to the Massachusetts Constitution.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> On cross motions for judgment on the pleadings, the motion judge ordered declaratory relief and issued a writ of mandamus ordering the department to enforce art. 97. We granted the BRA\u2019s application for direct appellate review. We are presented with two principal questions: Whether the project site, which the BRA took by eminent domain for urban renewal purposes, is subject to art. 97; and if art. 97 does apply, whether the department may issue the chapter 91 license to the BRA without triggering the requirement of a two-thirds vote of the Legislature. We conclude that the project site is not subject to art. 97.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b623-12\">1. <em>Background, </em>a. <em>The BRA and the 1964 urban renewal plan. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>The BRA is both a \u201credevelopment authority\u201d under G. L. c. 121B, \u00a7 4, and an \u201curban renewal agency\u201d under G. L. c. 121B, \u00a7 9.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Additionally, it serves as the planning board for the city of Boston and monitors private development under G. L. c. 121A. See St. 1960, c. 652, \u00a7\u00a7 12-14.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-5\">The BRA\u2019s urban renewal powers and duties are enumerated throughout G. L. c. 121B, particularly in \u00a7 11 and \u00a7\u00a7 45-57A. The legislative goals of G. L. c. 121B are to \u201celiminat[e] decadent, substandard, or blighted open\u201d areas and to promote sound community growth. G. L. c. 121B, \u00a7 45. See G. L. c. 121B, \u00a7 1 (defining decadent, substandard, and blighted open areas). The BRA is vested with the authority to effectuate the goals of urban renewal through land assembly, title confirmation, public financial assistance, and development and design controls, all of which enable the BRA to guide private sector development toward areas in need. See G. L. c. 121B, \u00a7\u00a7 46-57A. Perhaps the most significant power granted to the BRA is the power of eminent domain, which G. L. c. 121B confers on the BRA as is \u201cnecessary or reasonably required to carry out the purposes of [c. 121B],\u201d G. L. c. 121B, \u00a7 11 <em>(d), </em>such purposes being the elimination of \u201cdecadent, substandard or blighted open conditions.\u201d G. L. c. 121B, \u00a7 45.* ****<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b624-6\">Pursuant to the Downtown Waterfront-Faneuil Hall urban <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>renewal plan, dated April 15, 1964 (1964 urban renewal plan), and an order of taking, dated June 4, 1970, which incorporated that plan, the BRA acquired the project site in 1970 as part of a larger taking by eminent domain of the Long Wharf area (1970 taking). In accordance with the legislative goals of G. L. c. 121B, the 1964 urban renewal plan provides in Section 201:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b625-4\">\u201cThe basic goal of urban renewal action in the Downtown Waterfront-Faneuil Hall Area is to stimulate and to facilitate development efforts in the area, by eliminating those severe conditions of blight, deterioration, obsolescence, traffic congestion and incompatible land uses which hinder private investment in new development without the aid of governmental action, in order to (1) revitalize a key portion of downtown Boston; (2) upgrade the pattern of land uses close by the North End residential community; (3) establish a functional connection between the area and its surrounding districts: the North End, the Government Center and the Financial District; and (4) provide an environment suitable to the needs of contemporary real estate development.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b626-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>b. <em>The project site. </em>The project site is a section of land at the eastern end of Long Wharf on which sits an open-air brick structure known as Long Wharf Pavilion. The BRA continues to hold and maintain Long Wharf, including the project site, pursuant to the 1964 urban renewal plan.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Long Wharf is a designated national historic landmark, and is the site of water transportation, public transportation, hotels, retail establishments, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>restaurants. It is also part of the Boston Harborwalk, a pedestrian walkway that lines the waterfront.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-5\">In 1983, the department<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> permitted the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority to construct an emergency egress and ventilation shaft for the Blue Line subway tunnel, to be capped off by the structure now known as Long Wharf Pavilion. At the same time, the BRA undertook renovations to the plaza area surrounding the pavilion. The plaza measures approximately 33,000 square feet, is paved with granite flagstones, and features a large inlaid compass rose to the south of the pavilion. Other features include benches, public binoculars, and a flag pole. A segment of the Harborwalk lines the perimeter of the plaza. Although not discussed in much detail in the 1964 urban renewal plan, the plaza\u2019s current use is consistent with the plan\u2019s provision for an \u201cobservation platform\u201d on Long Wharf.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-6\">In addition to the 1964 urban renewal plan, the project site is also subject to Boston\u2019s Municipal Harbor Plan, which was approved in 1991 by the Secretary of the Executive Office of Environmental Affairs pursuant to 301 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7\u00a7 23.00 (2000) (municipal harbor plan). Among other objectives, the municipal harbor plan calls for the activation and revitalization of Boston\u2019s underutilized shoreline \u201cby promoting growth through private investment that is appropriately designed, and is a balanced mix of uses that bring vitality to the waterfront and public benefits and amenities that are shared by all Boston residents.\u201d The municipal harbor plan was designed to complement waterways regulations that accompanied G. L. c. 91, already applicable to much of the waterfront area.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-7\">Considering the project site to be underutilized, the BRA proposed a plan in 2008 to redevelop it by enclosing and expanding the pavilion to accommodate a restaurant with outdoor seating, \u201ctakeout service,\u201d and a bar. Specifically, the BRA planned to expand the 3,430 square foot pavilion by 1,225 square feet. In addition to the restaurant, the proposed redevelopment includes shaded seating, restrooms, and several sets of binoculars, all available to the public independent of patronage of the restaurant. The proposed redevelopment is intended to allow year-round <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>use of the pavilion and provide facilities and seating to the large number of pedestrians and water transit users who frequent the area.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-5\">The BRA obtained fourteen zoning variances from the Boston zoning board of appeals that allow for live entertainment, \u201ctakeout service,\u201d and food and alcohol service until 1 a.m. at the proposed restaurant. In addition, because the project site is located on filled tidelands, the BRA was required to obtain the chapter 91 license from the department. See G. L. c. 91, \u00a7 14; 310 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7\u00a7 9.00-9.55 (2012). See also <em>Moot </em>v. <em>Department of Envtl. Protection, </em>448 Mass. 340, 342 (2007), <em>S.C., </em>456 Mass. 309 (2010) (discussing applicability of G. L. c. 91, which governs development on tidelands).</p>\n<p id=\"b628-6\">The department granted the chapter 91 license to the BRA on September 17, 2008. The plaintiffs appealed. They argued that the proposed restaurant would create unnecessary noise and would damage public open space, parkland, and scenic quality.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> On January 29, 2010, the commissioner of the department issued a final decision affirming the issuance of the chapter 91 license.* <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The plaintiffs appealed from that final decision to the Superior Court, seeking a declaratory judgment under G. L. c. 231A and a writ of mandamus under G. L. c. 249, \u00a7 5, ordering the department to enforce the requirements of art. 97 by seeking a two-thirds vote of the Legislature prior to issuing the license. The motion judge concluded that because the 1964 urban renewal plan aimed to create parkland, open space, and a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>means of utilizing and enjoying the harbor, it served art. 97 purposes and was therefore subject to art. 97. The judge further concluded that the issuance of the chapter 91 license constituted a transfer of legal control from the department to the BRA sufficient to effect a disposition, as well as a change in use of the land, both of which triggered the two-thirds vote requirement. Accordingly, the judge granted the plaintiffs\u2019 requested relief.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b629-4\">On appeal, the plaintiffs contend that the project site is subject to art. 97, and that the department\u2019s issuance of the chapter 91 license constituted a use or disposition triggering the two-thirds vote requirement. The BRA counters that art. 97 does not apply because the project site was not taken for art. 97 purposes. The department argues that it lacks the authority to interpret and apply art. 97, and that even if art. 97 did apply, the department\u2019s issuance of the chapter 91 license did not constitute a use or disposition triggering the vote requirement. Both defendants argue that the motion judge improperly voided the chapter 91 license through declaratory and mandamus relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-5\">2. <em>Discussion, </em>a. <em>Applicability of art. 97. </em>Article 97 was approved and ratified on November 7, 1972, superseding art. 49 of the Amendments. See note 3, <em>supra. </em>It provides, in pertinent part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b629-6\">\u201cThe people shall have the right to clean air and water, freedom from excessive and unnecessary noise, and the natural, scenic, historic, and esthetic qualities of their environment; and <em>the protection of the people in their right to the conservation, development and utilization of the agricultural, mineral, forest, water, air and other natural resources is hereby declared to be a public purpose.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b629-7\">\u201cThe general court shall have the power to enact legislation necessary or expedient to protect such rights.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b630-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>66</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AqIA\">\u201cLands and easements <em>taken or acquired for such purposes </em>shall not be used for other purposes or otherwise disposed of except by laws enacted by a two-thirds vote, taken by yeas and nays, of each branch of the general court.\u201d (Emphases added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b630-6\">The principal issue in this case concerns whether the project site, which the BRA took by eminent domain in 1970, was \u201ctaken\u201d for art. 97 purposes. See <em>Selectmen of Hanson </em>v. <em>Lindsay, </em>444 Mass. 502, 504-506 (2005) (in order for art. 97 vote requirement to apply, land must have been taken or acquired for art. 97 purposes). Article 97 clearly states that its purposes are \u201cthe conservation, development and utilization of the agricultural, mineral, forest, water, air and other natural resources.\u201d In contrast, land taken for urban renewal purposes is generally understood to be taken \u201cfor the purpose of eliminating decadent, substandard or blighted open conditions.\u201d G. L. c. 121B, \u00a7 45. See <em>Aaron </em>v. <em>Boston Redev. Auth., </em>66 Mass. App. Ct. 804, 807, 808, 810 (2006) (in context of claim for prescriptive easement, land taken by BRA for urban renewal purposes held for \u201cother public purpose,\u201d not conservation). Although as a practical matter, certain aspects of an urban renewal plan may accomplish goals similar to those outlined in art. 97, the overarching purpose for which the land is taken is distinct from art. 97 purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-7\">With that distinction in mind, the issue is whether the project site can nonetheless be characterized as having been \u201ctaken or acquired for [art. 97] purposes.\u201d Reported cases interpreting art. 97 are scarce. In concluding that the project site was taken for art. 97 purposes, the motion judge relied heavily on the June 6, 1973, opinion of then Attorney General Robert Quinn. See Rep. A.G., Pub. Doc. No. 12, at 139 (1973) (Quinn Opinion). Using the Quinn Opinion for guidance, she identified certain aims or objectives referenced in the 1964 urban renewal plan, including the creation of public ways, parks, open space, and plazas, and a means of utilizing and enjoying the harbor. Because those aims were consistent with the purposes of art. 97, the judge concluded that the project site, which realizes them, was taken for art. 97 purposes and is therefore subject to the two-thirds <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>vote requirement. Not surprisingly, the plaintiffs rely extensively on the Quinn Opinion in their arguments before this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-5\">The Quinn Opinion was issued in response to a general inquiry from the Speaker of the House of Representatives regarding the applicability of art. 97, and was rendered without reference to any particular set of facts. Although the Quinn Opinion is entitled to careful judicial consideration on the question of the scope of art. 97 and the intent of its drafters, see <em>Opinions of the Justices, </em>383 Mass. 895, 918 (1981), citing Rep. A.G., Pub. Doc. No. 12, at 141 (concluding art. 97 applies retroactively), its interpretation of art. 97 is not binding in its particulars, and we are hesitant to afford it too much weight due to the generalized nature of the inquiry and the hypothetical nature of the response.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> See AJ. Celia, Administrative Law and Practice \u00a7 20, at 70-75 (1986) (discussing legal effect of opinions of the Attorney General).</p>\n<p id=\"b631-6\">The Quinn Opinion suggests a more expansive reading of art. 97 than we afford it today, and it may reasonably be read to support the plaintiffs\u2019 argument that the project site is subject to art. 97. We disagree with the Quinn Opinion to the extent it suggests that the vast majority of land taken for any public purpose may become subject to art. 97 if the taking or use even incidentally promotes the \u201cconservation, development and utilization of the . . . forest, water and air,\u201d Rep. A.G., Pub. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>Doc. No. 12, at 142, or that the land simply displays some attributes of art. 97 land generally.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 143. We also do not agree that the relatively imprecise language of art. 97 warrants <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>an interpretation as broad as the Quinn Opinion would afford it, particularly in light of the practical consequences that would result from such an expansive application, as well as the ability of a narrower interpretation to serve adequately the stated goals of art. 97.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-5\">The critical question to be answered is not whether the use of the land incidentally serves purposes consistent with art. 97, or whether the land displays some attributes of art. 97 land, but whether the land was <em>taken for those purposes, </em>or subsequent to the taking was designated for those purposes in a manner sufficient to invoke the protection of art. 97. See <em>Selectmen of Hanson </em>v. <em>Lindsay, </em>444 Mass. 502, 508-509 (2005) (art. 97 protections may arise where subsequent to taking for purposes other than art. 97, land is \u201cspecifically designated\u201d for art. 97 purpose by deed or other recorded restriction). See also <em>Toro </em>v. <em>Mayor of Revere, 9 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 871, 872 (1980) (applicability of art. 97 hinged on whether land had in fact been conveyed \u201cto the conservation commission ... to maintain and preserve it for the use of the public for conservation purposes\u201d). In this case, while it can be argued that the project site displays some of the attributes of a park<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> and serves the purpose of the utilization of natural resources \u2014 in that it promotes access to the waterfront and the sea \u2014 this specific use is incidental to the overarching purpose of urban renewal for which the land including the project site was originally taken. Cf. <em>Benevolent &amp; Protective Order of Elks, Lodge No. 65 </em>v. <em>Planning Bd. of Lawrence, </em>403 Mass. 531, 551-552 (1988), citing <em>Papadinis </em>v. <em>Somerville, </em>331 Mass. <em>621, </em>632 (1954) (any benefit from disposition to private redeveloper of land taken for urban renewal purposes is \u201cincidental to the main purpose of the plan, which is the elimination of a substandard, decadent, or blighted open area\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b633-6\">In <em>Selectmen of Hanson </em>v. <em>Lindsay, supra, </em>we held that a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>town meeting vote to designate for conservation purposes land that had originally been taken for tax purposes did not subject that land to art. 97 protections absent recordation of a restriction on the tide. Without the execution or recordation of a deed containing the conservation restriction, the land \u201cnever became specifically designated for conservation purposes in the first instance\u201d and accordingly \u201cwas not held for a specific purpose\u201d under art. 97, so \u201ccompliance with the provisions of art. 97 . . . was not required.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 508-509. This was true despite the clear intent of the town meeting members to hold the property for conservation purposes. <em>Id. </em>at 505. As the plain language of art. 97 indicates, for land to be subject to the two-thirds vote requirement on disposition or use for other purposes, it must be \u201c <em>taken or acquired for [the] </em>purpose\u201d of protecting interests covered by art. 97. In <em>Selectmen of Hanson </em>v. <em>Lindsay, supra </em>at 508-509, where the property had indisputably been acquired as a tax forfeiture and held as general corporate property, the town had to deed the land to itself for conservation purposes \u2014 or record an equivalent restriction on the deed \u2014 in order for art. 97 to apply to subsequent dispositions or use for other purposes. Here, where the land at issue is but a small part of a much larger taking effectuated for the purposes of urban renewal, it is difficult to identify a \u201cspecific purpose\u201d for which the project site was acquired or held that would clearly bring it within the protection of art. 97.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> See <em>id. </em>at 509.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-4\">Because the spirit of art. 97 is derived from the related doctrine of \u201cprior public use,\u201d cases applying that doctrine inform our analysis. See Rep. A.G., Pub. Doc. No. 12, at 146 (prior public use doctrine \u201cbackground against which [art. 97] was approved\u201d). See also Rep. A.G., Pub. Doc. No. 14, 131 (1980) (\u201clanguage of Article 97 must be read in conjunction with the judicially developed doctrine of \u2018prior public use\u2019 \u201d). The prior public use doctrine holds that \u201cpublic lands devoted to one public use cannot be diverted to another inconsistent public use without plain and explicit legislation authorizing the diversion.\u201d <em>Robbins </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Works, </em>355 Mass. 328, 330 (1969). See <em>Brookline </em>v. <em>Metropolitan Dist. Comm\u2019n, </em>357 Mass. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>435, 440 (1970), and cases cited. However, that doctrine is only applicable \u201cto those lands which are in fact <em>\u2018devoted to one public use\u2019 </em>\u201d (emphasis added). <em>Muir </em>v. <em>Leominster, </em>2 Mass. App. Ct. 587, 591 (1974), quoting <em>Robbins </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Works, supra. </em>In the <em>Muir </em>case, the Appeals Court held the prior public use doctrine inapplicable to the sale for commercial purposes of a parcel of land, where that parcel had been conveyed to a city as a gift with no limitation on its use but was in fact used for thirty years as a playground and for other recreational purposes. <em>Muir </em>v. <em>Leominster, supra </em>at 588-589, 591 (\u201c[I]n this case there had been neither prior legislative authorization of a taking for a particular purpose nor a prior public or private grant restricted to a particular purpose\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b635-5\">Here, as the motion judge highlighted, the 1964 urban renewal plan enumerates, among its listed planning and design objectives, certain objectives that are consistent with art. 97 purposes. The 1964 urban renewal plan also contains vague descriptions of the project site and Long Wharf generally that are consistent with its current use as an open space.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Most significantly, \u00a7 202 of the 1964 urban renewal plan, entitled \u201cPlanning Objectives,\u201d states as one of its fifteen objectives, the objective \u201c[t]o provide public ways, parks and plazas which encourage the pedestrian to enjoy the harbor and its activities.\u201d In addition, in \u00a7 203, entitled \u201cGeneral Design Principles,\u201d the plan lists several design principles, including:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-6\">\u201c3. To provide maximum opportunity for pedestrian access to the water\u2019s edge.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-7\">\u201c4. To establish an orderly sequence and hierarchy of open spaces and views for both the pedestrian and the motorist.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-8\">\u201c5. To establish a relationship between buildings, open <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>spaces and public ways which provides maximum protection to the pedestrian during unfavorable weather conditions.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b636-4\">By definition, G. L. c. 121B vests in the BRA the authority to take or acquire \u201cdecadent, substandard or blighted <em>open area[s]\u201d </em>for the purpose of eliminating those undesirable conditions (emphasis added). See G. L. c. 121B \u00a7\u00a7 11, 45, 47. However, it does not follow that, where a comprehensive urban renewal plan calls for some areas of a taking to be left open \u2014 without a more specific and particularized invocation of art. 97 purposes unique to those areas that effectively designates those areas as separate and apart from the rest of the taking \u2014 a two-thirds vote of the Legislature is required for any subsequent change in use or disposition of those open areas. Nor do we find sufficient to invoke art. 97 protection the fact that a comprehensive urban renewal plan may identify, among other objectives, some objectives that are consistent with art. 97 purposes, or where certain areas taken pursuant to that plan ultimately display some attributes of art. 97 land. A contrary rule would be particularly nonsensical where the proposed change in use or disposition that would purportedly trigger the two-thirds vote is made in furtherance of the goals of the particular urban renewal plan and is otherwise appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-5\">Given the overarching purpose of the 1964 urban renewal plan to eliminate urban blight through the comprehensive redevelopment of the waterfront area, including its revitalization through the development of mixed uses and amenities, it cannot be said that the retention of certain open spaces, like the project site, is sufficiently indicative of an art. 97 purpose as to trigger a two-thirds vote of the Legislature should the BRA wish to slightly revise the use of certain spaces in a manner consistent with the objectives of the original urban renewal plan.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> The fact that the 1964 Urban Renewal Plan (which covered a large <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>section of downtown Boston) provided in general terms for open spaces and pedestrian access to the water\u2019s edge is itself insufficient to invoke art. 97 protections for parts of the original taking that ultimately serve those general purposes. The single, fleeting reference in the 1964 urban renewal plan to an \u201cobservation platform\u201d on Long Wharf similarly fails to adequately invoke the specific purposes of art. 97.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-5\">Nevertheless, we disagree with the BRA\u2019s contention that it cannot possibly take land for art. 97 purposes pursuant to its urban renewal powers under G. L. c. 121B. The purposes served by urban renewal and by art. 97 are not mutually exclusive. Certainly, for the BRA to take land by eminent domain, it must exist in a \u201cdecadent, substandard, or blighted\u201d condition. However, where an urban renewal plan accompanying a taking clearly demonstrates a specific intent to reserve particular, well-defined areas of that taking for art. 97 purposes, the BRA conceivably may take land for such purposes while remaining within its statutory authority.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> The recording of a restriction on the use of land subsequent to a taking may also place land within the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>protections of art. 97. See <em>Selectmen of Hanson </em>v. <em>Lindsay, </em>444 Mass. 502, 504-506 (2005). Furthermore, we disagree with the BRA that the language of an order of taking is necessarily determinative of the applicability of art 97. Under certain circumstances not present here, the ultimate use to which the land is put may provide the best evidence of the purposes of the taking, notwithstanding the language of the original order of taking or accompanying urban renewal plan. See Quinn Opinion, <em>supra </em>at 142-143.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-5\">b. <em>Occurrence of triggering condition. </em>Even if art. 97 did apply to the project site, the issue would remain whether the department\u2019s issuance of the chapter 91 license constituted a disposition or change in use of the land triggering the two-thirds vote requirement. Although not necessary to our holding, we briefly address the issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-6\">The answer to this question depends on whether the chapter 91 license is in fact a mere license, or if it is more properly characterized as an easement. Although the granting of an easement over art. 97 land constitutes a disposition triggering the two-thirds vote requirement, a disposition of any lesser property interest does not. See <em>Opinions of the Justices, </em>383 Mass. 895, 919 (1981) (relinquishment by Commonwealth of any vestigial property interests in tidelands other than \u201clands and easements\u201d would not trigger art. 97 voting requirement); <em>Miller </em>v. <em>Commissioner of the Dep\u2019t of Envtl. Mgt., </em>23 Mass. App. Ct. 968, 969-970 (1987) (department\u2019s issuance of revocable one-year permit to operate ski area did not trigger two-thirds vote under art. 97).</p>\n<p id=\"b638-7\">General Laws c. 91, \u00a7 15, states that \u201cthe grant of a license\u201d under that chapter \u201cshall not convey a property right.\u201d<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>BRA owns the project site, and accordingly, the BRA\u2019s right to lease the Long Wharf Pavilion to a restaurant operator derives not from the chapter 91 license, but from the fact that the BRA owns the land. The chapter 91 license merely certifies that the planned use, including the lease, complies with G. L. c. 91 and accompanying department regulations. It does not, as the motion judge concluded, <em>transfer </em>from the department to the BRA \u201can extent of legal control over the land at issue.\u201d<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Any disposition triggering the art. 97 voting requirement would need to be granted <em>by </em>the BRA \u2014 as would be the case with the lease to the restaurant operator \u2014 not <em>to </em>the BRA.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-5\">The chapter 91 license itself is \u201cgranted upon the express condition that any and all other applicable authorizations . . . shall be secured by the Licensee <em>prior </em>to the commencement of any activity or use authorized pursuant to this License\u201d (emphasis in original). The license also states that it is \u201cgranted subject to all applicable Federal, State, County, and Municipal laws, ordinances and regulations.\u201d Even if, arguendo, the chapter 91 license created a property right, the right it created is a contingent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>future interest and would not trigger the voting requirement until the interest vests on obtaining all necessary approvals.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-5\">Nor does the issuance of the chapter 91 license constitute a \u201cuse[] for other purposes\u201d that would trigger the legislative vote. For lands to which art. 97 does apply, art. 97 legislative approval is likely just one of the many approvals a project proponent will need to acquire in order to proceed with the project. These approvals are issued by various State and local regulatory agencies and are largely independent of one another, yet all are necessary to proceed with the project. It would make little practical sense to condition the application for one such approval, in this case the chapter 91 license, on the successful application for another approval. The chapter 91 <em>license facilitates </em>the change in use in the same way the zoning variances and other necessary approvals do. A project proponent like the BRA could conceivably obtain the necessary approvals to change the use of land and, for myriad reasons, never follow through on the planned use. Article 97 requires a two-thirds vote of the Legislature prior to an actual change in use, not mere preparations for that change.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-6\">3. <em>Conclusion. </em>For the reasons discussed, we conclude that art. 97 does not apply to the project site and, therefore, a two-thirds vote of the Legislature is not required to approve the planned redevelopment. Because the motion judge did not review the issuance of the chapter 91 license pursuant to G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14, we remand the case to the Superior Court for proceedings consistent with this opinion.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b640-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b623-13\">Article 97 of the Amendments to the Massachusetts Constitution, approved and ratified on November 7, 1972, superseded art. 49 of the Amendments, but preserved the right of the people to enjoy the natural resources of the Commonwealth.

A.G., Pub. Doc. No. 12 (1973) (Quinn Opinion) paints a broad picture of the scope of art. 97. In response to the question, \u201cDoes the disposition or change of use of land held for park purposes require a two thirds vote ... as provided in [art. 97], or would a majority vote of each branch be sufficient for approval?\u201d the Quinn Opinion answered, \u201cYes,\u201d and then went on to suggest that the actual use, appearance, or attributes of a piece of land may be better evidence of the purpose for which it was taken or acquired than the language of the instrument effectuating the acquisition. <em>Id. </em>at 143. Its most expansive language reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-6\">\u201cTh[e] question as to [the applicability of art. 97 to] parks raises a further practical matter in regard to implementing Article 97 which warrants further discussion. The reasons the Legislature employs to explain its actions can be of countless levels of specificity or generality and land might conceivably be acquired for general recreation purposes or for very explicit uses such as the playing of baseball, the flying of kites, for evening strolls or for Sunday afternoon concerts. <em>Undoubtedly, to the average man, such land would serve as a park but at even a more legalistic level it clearly can also be observed that such land was acquired, in the language of Article 97, because it was a \u2018resource\u2019 which could best be \u2018utilized\u2019 and \u2018developed\u2019 by being \u2018conserved\u2019 within a park. But it is not surprising that most land taken or acquired for public use is acquired under the specific terms of statutes which may not match verbatim the more general terms found in Article 10 of the Declaration of Rights of the Constitution or in Articles 39, 43, 49, 51 and 97 of the Amendments. Land originally acquired for limited or specified public purposes is thus not to be excluded from the operation of the two-thirds roll-call vote requirement for lack of express invocation of the more general purposes of Article 97. Rather the scope of the Amendment is to be very broadly construed, </em>not only because of the greater broadness in \u2018public purpose,\u2019 changed from \u2018public uses\u2019 appearing in Article 49, but also because Article 97 establishes that the protection to be afforded by the Amendment is not only of public uses but of certain express rights of the people.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-7\">\u201cThus, all land, easements and interests therein are covered by Article 97 if taken or acquired for \u2018the protection of the people in their right to the conservation, development and utilization of the agricultural, mineral, forest, water, air and other natural resources\u2019 as these terms are broadly construed. <em>While small greens remaining as the result of constructing public highways may be excluded, it is suggested that parks, monuments, reservations, athletic fields, concert areas and playgrounds clearly qualify. Given the spirit of the Amendment and the duty of the General Court, it would seem prudent to classify lands and easements taken or acquired for specific purposes not found verbatim </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number><em>in Article 97 as nevertheless subject to Article 97 if reasonable doubt exists concerning their actual status.\u201d </em>(Emphases added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b633-9\"><em>Id. </em>at 142-143.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b633-10\">As the motion judge noted, a bronze plaque located on the plaza designates the area as \u201cLong Wharf Park,\u201d and the BRA\u2019s owned-land database identifies the area at the end of Long Wharf as a \u201cpark.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b634-5\">We do not conclude that land taken pursuant to an urban renewal plan is automatically immune from art. 97.

The Attorney General\u2019s letter relied primarily on the language of the Government Center urban renewal plan, which specifically stated that the site of City Hall Plaza \u201cshall be devoted to public open space,\u201d as well as the BRA\u2019s description of the Plaza at the unveiling of the plan in 1963:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b637-9\">\u201cThe strong focal point of the Government Center will be the new City Hall and the Government Center Plaza. Comparable as a <em>monumental public space </em>to the most famous squares in Europe . . .

In addition, any revocation of the chapter 91 license is considered a taking that requires just compensation for \u201cvaluable structures, fillings, enclosures, uses or other improvements built, made or continued in compliance with said authorization or license.\u201d G. L. c. 91, \u00a7 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-9\">Furthermore, G.

Mgt., </em>23 Mass. App. Ct. 968, 969-970 (1987). Second, and perhaps more important, in issuing the chapter 91 license, the department has not <em>transferred </em>legal control over the project site. As the agency charged with enforcing G. L. c. 91, the department has no affirmative legal control over the project site; it is merely vested with the authority to ensure that uses that implicate G. L. c. 91 conform with its requirements and the accompanying regulations.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b640-8\">We note, however, that with art. 97 inapplicable and relief in the form of mandamus therefore inappropriate, we have serious doubts whether the plaintiffs can demonstrate standing to otherwise challenge the chapter 91 license. The department\u2019s hearing officer concluded that the plaintiffs did not have standing because they failed to demonstrate that the issuance of the license may cause them to \u201csuffer an injury in fact, which is different either in kind or magnitude from that suffered by the general public which is within the scope of the public interest protected by [G. L. c. 91].\u201d See 310 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 9.02 (2008). In her final decision, the commissioner declined to adopt the hearing officer\u2019s finding of a lack of standing because of her conclusion that the plaintiffs\u2019 challenge failed on the merits.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
