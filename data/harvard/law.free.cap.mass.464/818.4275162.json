Represented by new counsel on appeal, the defendant asserts that a reduction in the verdict is required because there was insufficient evidence to support the jury\u2019s verdict of murder by extreme atrocity or cruelty. He also argues error in the admission of evidence, the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument, and the jury instructions, and seeks relief pursuant to G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E. Because we conclude that no error requires a new trial and discern no reason to exercise our power pursuant to G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-5\"><em>Background. </em>We recite the facts the jury could have found, reserving certain details for our discussion of the issues raised. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Belcher, </em>446 Mass. 693, 694 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b837-6\">The victim, who was nineteen years old when she disappeared in March, 1986, married the defendant in December, 1984. She and the defendant had a volatile relationship.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Sometime in the late fall of 1985, the victim separated from the defendant and moved into her mother\u2019s home in Acushnet. She would see the defendant periodically after their separation, and the defendant at one point stayed in the cellar at his mother-in-law\u2019s home, without his mother-in-law\u2019s knowledge. There were numerous times that neighbors saw the defendant cross their yards to get to the victim\u2019s mother\u2019s home. Once there, the defendant sat on the back steps or looked in the windows. This behavior continued until the victim disappeared. In February, 1986, the defendant took his sister\u2019s vehicle without her permission and followed the victim to New Bedford. He was involved in an accident on the way and abandoned the damaged vehicle at the scene.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-7\">During their separation, the defendant was jealous of other men he saw with the victim. He asked the victim\u2019s sister about the victim\u2019s whereabouts and her clothing. The defendant physically attacked one man who had dropped the victim off after her evening waitressing shift and told him that he and the victim <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"820\">*820</page-number>were trying to make their relationship work. The night before the victim\u2019s disappearance, the defendant vandalized the vehicle of another man whom the victim had been dating.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-5\">At approximately noon on March 4, 1986, the victim visited a neighbor, repaid some of the money she owed her, and told her she would pay the outstanding twenty dollars the next day because she was working that night. After returning home a few minutes later, the victim informed her mother that she was going out to meet the defendant, who had telephoned her that morning.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-6\">The victim and the defendant met in a nearby field. The victim did not return. Later that evening, the victim\u2019s sister saw the defendant at her mother\u2019s home, looking \u201cflushed . . . like he had been running.\u201d He retrieved his belongings from the cellar, telling the victim\u2019s sister, \u201cThe cops are after me.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b838-7\">Two days later, the victim\u2019s sister and mother found the victim\u2019s Nike brand sneakers and socks in a culvert near the field. They filed a missing person report that day.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Police conducted multiple search efforts to find the victim; the defendant did not participate. He also fled from the police on several occasions when police tried to speak with him. On March 10, 1986, police were able to contact and question the defendant, who admitted that, on the day the victim disappeared, he had telephoned and asked her to meet him in the field. He told police that they had met there and talked, and although the defendant wanted to continue their relationship, the victim told him she was going to go to Florida with someone named Kevin. During the course of the initial investigation, police tested the defendant\u2019s denim jacket, which had a reddish-brown stain, for blood.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Police also took possession of a white pullover sweatshirt, similar to the one the victim wore on the day of her disap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"821\">*821</page-number>pearance, that was found in the woods approximately one month after the victim disappeared.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-5\">On March 30, 1986, the defendant told his friend he was moving to Florida and requested help in \u201cmoving some stuff.\u201d They put a rolled up and tied rug into the bed of the friend\u2019s truck. The defendant instructed his friend to drive in a manner whereby other vehicles would not see the truck\u2019s contents. They stopped at a quarry in Dartmouth, a local swimming place, lifted the rug from the truck bed, and placed it in the water. The defendant made sure the rug was submerged in deeper water. As they drove away, the defendant said, \u201cSee ya, bitch.\u201d The defendant threatened to kill his friend\u2019s pregnant wife if he told anyone what they had done.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-6\">The defendant moved to Florida, where he lived for some time. While out of State, he maintained contact with the friend who had helped him move the rug, and whom he telephoned approximately one month after he moved to inquire whether anything was in the newspaper. The defendant also asked him to \u201cget rid of\u201d a cement cinder block that was in his friend\u2019s yard. At some point, the defendant returned to Massachusetts, where he admitted to two people to killing the victim and disposing of her body.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-7\">In April, 1990, divers found the victim\u2019s partially skeletonized remains in the quarry in Dartmouth. The victim\u2019s body was in a sitting position suspended in the water, and her legs were bound together by a rope attached to a cement block laying at the bottom of the quarry. The rope connecting the victim\u2019s body to the cinder block had been looped twice around the victim\u2019s knees, with the other end tied off to one of the outer holes of the cinder block.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-8\">Subsequent dives recovered some of the victim\u2019s bones, in-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"822\">*822</page-number>eluding her fractured jaw and skull,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> as well as remains of a chair and parts of the victim\u2019s clothing, including a white shirt collar.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The medical examiner, who had performed the autopsy on the victim, testified that the victim died as a result of blunt force trauma to the head.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b840-4\">No new evidence came to light until 2007, when police, who were interviewing former Acushnet residents living in Florida, learned of one of the defendant\u2019s confessions. On December 5, 2007, a Bristol County grand jury returned an indictment charging the defendant with murder. While detained and awaiting trial, the defendant discussed the victim with another inmate.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-5\">The defendant, who did not testify at trial, offered a theory of defense that someone else, such as a stranger or someone dating the victim, had killed, and perhaps sexually assaulted, the victim and dumped her body in the quarry. Based on the defendant\u2019s statement to police that the victim had told him she was going to Florida with someone named Kevin, and a witness who testified he saw the victim in Florida more than one year after her disappearance, defense counsel also argued in the alternative that the victim had run away. Further, counsel suggested that the police investigation had been inadequate, that the defendant had been targeted by police, and that the defendant\u2019s admissions did not amount to a confession. He also asserted that the evidence of a broken jaw and fractured skull did not warrant a conviction of murder in the first degree based on a theory of extreme atrocity or cruelty.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-6\"><em>Discussion. </em>1. <em>Admission of medical examiner\u2019s testimony. </em>The defendant argues that the medical examiner\u2019s testimony was speculative because there was no statement as to what caused the blunt force trauma to the victim\u2019s skull. A medical examiner\u2019s testimony is not speculative where the testimony is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"823\">*823</page-number>based on a reasonable degree of medical certainty and his or her experience and knowledge. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rodriguez, </em>437 Mass. 554, 563 (2002); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Nadworny, </em>396 Mass. 342, 358 (1985), cert, denied, <em>477 </em>U.S. 904 (1986). There was no error. Here, the medical examiner testified that there could have been several potential causes of the victim\u2019s injuries, but that the cause of death was blunt force trauma to the head.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-5\">The medical examiner testified as follows: the victim\u2019s skull had a four- to five-inch fracture on the outer plate and inner plate of her skull at the back of her head. He stated that \u201c[c]on-siderable\u201d force was required to fracture a skull in that manner, and the impact resulting in such a fracture would \u201ccause the brain to react,\u201d rendering a person unconscious and ultimately causing death in \u201cseconds, minutes, hours, [or] days.\u201d The skull fracture could have been caused by \u201csome force applied\u201d to the head by a flat solid object such as \u201ca floor,\u201d \u201ca board,\u201d \u201ca tree,\u201d \u201ca rock,\u201d or \u201cthe ground.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b841-6\">The victim\u2019s jaw was fractured in a manner consistent with a punch to the front or side of the face. The jaw and skull fractures were \u201cconsistent with two separate impacts,\u201d both of which would be caused by \u201cconsiderable force\u201d but were not consistent with an impact with water. The jaw and skull fractures were on the same side of the body, indicating that the head wound was not the result of a fall caused by being punched in the jaw. The victim\u2019s lower torso was in a seated position, with her knees at an angle, as though she were sitting.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b841-7\">Here, the medical examiner\u2019s testimony was based on a reasonable degree of medical certainty and his experience and knowledge. There was no error in the admission of the medical examiner\u2019s testimony. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rodriguez, </em>supra; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Snell, </em>428 Mass. 766, 779, cert, denied, 527 U.S. 1010 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b841-8\">2. <em>Sufficiency of the evidence. </em>The defendant asserts that the evidence does not support a conviction of murder in the first degree on the theory of extreme atrocity or cruelty. A jury can consider several factors to determine whether a murder was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"824\">*824</page-number>committed with extreme atrocity or cruelty: \u201c[1] indifference to or taking pleasure in the victim\u2019s suffering, [2] consciousness and degree of suffering of the victim, [3] extent of physical injuries, [4] number of blows, [5] manner and force with which delivered, [6] instrument employed, and [7] disproportion between the means needed to cause death and those employed.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cunneen, </em>389 Mass. 216, 227-228 (1983). If the jury find even one of these factors, they may establish that the murder was committed with extreme atrocity or cruelty, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Young, </em>461 Mass. 198, 204 (2012), citing Model Jury Instructions on Homicide 14 (1999), and \u201c[bjecause they are not elements of the offense, unanimity is not required.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Moses, </em>436 Mass. 598, 606 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b842-5\">The defendant first argues that the <em>Cunneen </em>factors are vague and arbitrarily applied and therefore have resulted in a violation of his constitutional due process rights. We addressed this issue in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Moses, supra, </em>where we concluded that the factors do not violate a defendant\u2019s constitutional rights. Here, at least three <em>Cunneen </em>factors (the victim\u2019s consciousness and degree of suffering, the manner and force causing the victim\u2019s physical injuries, and the defendant\u2019s indifference to or taking pleasure in the victim\u2019s suffering) were among the reasonable inferences a rational jury could make.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-6\">The defendant next asserts that the Commonwealth did not meet its burden to prove that he killed the victim with extreme atrocity or cruelty because it offered three separate reasons for the victim\u2019s death, and because evidence of a broken jaw and skull fracture does not warrant a conviction of murder committed with extreme atrocity or cruelty.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-7\">A conviction may be based on circumstantial evidence and the permissible inferences drawn therefrom. <em>Corson </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>428 Mass. 193, 197 (1998). A permissible inference is one that is \u201creasonable and possible\u201d; it need not be \u201cnecessary or inescapable.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Casale, </em>381 Mass. 167, 173 (1980). \u201cWhether an inference is warranted or is impermis-sibly remote must be determined, not by hard and fast rules of law, but by experience and common sense.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lao, </em>443 Mass. 770, 779 (2005), <em>S.C., </em>450 Mass. 215 (2007), and 460 Mass. 12 (2011), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Giang, </em>402 Mass. 604, 609 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b843-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"825\">*825</page-number>There was ample evidence from which the jury reasonably could infer that the defendant murdered the victim with extreme atrocity or cruelty.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The defendant\u2019s admissions alone provide sufficient evidence that the defendant killed the victim with extreme atrocity or cruelty. The defendant told one witness that he became angry after finding the victim at a party, took her outside, drove her away, then \u201cslammed her down . . . strapped her to [a] chair . . . taped her mouth shut [and] threw her in the . . . bottomless pit . . . where she won\u2019t be lying and playing games.\u201d While telling the witness what had occurred, the defendant mimicked the victim\u2019s pleading to return home and used his hands to indicate his actions of punching and shaking her. When the witness told the defendant that \u201cbodies float,\u201d the defendant replied, \u201c[N]ot this one. It\u2019s weighed down with a block.\u201d When speaking to an inmate while awaiting trial, he stated that the victim was \u201ca lying cheating whore, and he couldn\u2019t take it anymore, so he choked her out [and] took her body for a swim.\u201d From these statements, the jury reasonably could infer that the defendant was indifferent to the victim\u2019s suffering. Moreover, his single admission that he \u201cchoked out,\u201d or strangled, the victim, supports a reasonable inference that the defendant was indifferent to or took pleasure in the victim\u2019s conscious suffering. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mejia, </em>461 Mass. 384, 393 (2012) (verdict of murder committed with extreme atrocity or cruelty supported by evidence of death occurring after three minutes of strangulation).</p>\n<p id=\"b843-5\">Even without the defendant\u2019s admissions, there was sufficient physical evidence to support the conviction. The medical examiner\u2019s findings that the victim was hit in the back of the head with a hard, flat object, the blow causing death in \u201cseconds, minutes, hours, [or] days,\u201d is not only evidence of the defend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"826\">*826</page-number>ant\u2019s indifference to the victim\u2019s conscious suffering, but also evidence of the excessive manner and force by which the physical injuries were inflicted. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Podkowka, </em>445 Mass. 692, 698 (2006) (reasonable inference of extreme atrocity or cruelty where jury could infer victim experienced severe pain when no single blow to victim\u2019s head caused unconsciousness); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Anderson, </em>445 Mass. 195, 201-202 (2005). The jury also reasonably could have inferred that the 240-pound defendant tied the victim, who was \u201cpetite,\u201d to a chair, and then beat her such that she sustained injury to her jaw and skull and threw her into the quarry. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Raymond, </em>424 Mass. 382, 383, 390 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b844-5\">The defendant argues that the Commonwealth presented inconsistent \u201ccompeting hypotheses\u201d of the victim\u2019s death and needed to prove that each potential manner of death occurred with malice. This argument is unavailing because the Commonwealth presented evidence that the victim was assaulted in a single attack that led to her death, not three separate incidents, and the medical examiner testified, based on physical evidence, that the cause of death was blunt force trauma to the skull.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-6\">3. <em>Admission of defendant\u2019s jailhouse telephone call recordings. </em>At trial, the Commonwealth introduced evidence that the defendant\u2019s jacket had a blood stain that matched the victim\u2019s deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA). Over the defendant\u2019s objection, the judge admitted a portion of an April 14, 2008, telephone call between the defendant and a woman, made while the defendant was incarcerated and awaiting trial. In the recording, the defendant discussed the stain on his jacket and made statements concerning its nature and origin.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The defendant argues that the admission of this evidence amounted to prejudicial error because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"827\">*827</page-number>its relevance was outweighed by its prejudicial effect. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Flebotte, </em>417 Mass. 348, 353 (1994); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dunn, </em>407 Mass. 798, 807 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b845-4\">The defendant\u2019s conversation addressed the issue whether the stain on the jacket was relevant because it implicated the defendant in the victim\u2019s murder. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Valentin, </em>420 Mass. 263, 270 (1995), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dunn, supra </em>(\u201cEvidence is relevant if it has a rational tendency to prove a material issue\u201d). The defendant was hypothesizing about how blood came to be on his jacket and was speculating about how <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"828\">*828</page-number>the results of the DNA testing might be explained away. His statements indicate consciousness of guilt. Moreover, the recording was not cumulative of other evidence. The recording presents the defendant\u2019s admissions concerning the stain on his jacket, which he categorizes as blood. This information is not repetitive of the State police criminologist\u2019s testimony about testing the stain. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Brown, 449 Mass. 747, 770 (2007), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Carroll, </em>439 Mass. 547, 553 (2003) (\u201cjudge may exclude evidence that is \u2018cumulative, repetitive, or confusing\u2019 \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b846-5\">Admission of the recording did not unduly prejudice the defendant. \u201c[Wjhether the probative value of relevant evidence is outweighed by its prejudicial effect [is a] question[] within the sound discretion of the judge.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Martinez, </em>431 Mass. 168, 174 (2000). It is clear that the judge \u201cconsidered the duty of the Court to engage in a weighing calculation.\u201d He reflected on potential prejudice to the defendant when he discussed with counsel, outside the presence of the jury, the \u201cmost direct way, the least prejudicial way to introduce the calls.\u201d The judge relied on his \u201cknowledge of the case as a whole,\u201d viewed the conversation \u201cin the context of other calls,\u201d and admitted only a small portion of the recording to ensure evidence not relevant to a material issue was excluded and to minimize any prejudicial impact. Further, the jury could have credited the defendant\u2019s admission, \u201cI believe the blood that\u2019s on my jacket is from before, a long time before she disappeared,\u201d as a truthful statement, in which case the admission of the recording could have bolstered the jury\u2019s belief in the defendant\u2019s innocence. There was no error. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Simpson, </em>434 Mass. 570, 578-579 (2001) (evidentiary rulings are \u201centrusted to the trial judge\u2019s broad discretion and are not disturbed absent palpable error\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b846-6\">Moreover, to the extent that the recording reminded the jury that the defendant had been incarcerated, any potential prejudice would have been adequately cured by the judge\u2019s instruction. The judge stated, \u201c[T]he fact that the defendant may have been held awaiting trial means nothing. Nothing. Absolutely nothing. Because that\u2019s the law. The law is that it\u2019s presumed that he will be held. And so you can\u2019t of course hold that against him. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"829\">*829</page-number>That has nothing to do with his presumption of innocence. It has nothing to do with his right to a fair trial. It is irrelevant, and you cast it from your minds.\u201d \u201cJurors are presumed to follow a judge\u2019s instructions,\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>450 Mass. 645,651 (2008), and we presume they followed the instructions here.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-5\">4. <em>Prosecutor\u2019s closing argument. </em>The defendant next asserts that the prosecutor \u201cmisuse[d]\u201d the evidence in his closing argument, creating impermissible inferences that appealed to jurors\u2019 emotions. We view the prosecutor\u2019s remarks \u201cin light of the \u2018entire argument, as well as in light of the judge\u2019s instruction to the jury and the evidence at trial.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ortiz, </em>463 Mass. 402, 415 (2012), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Raposa, </em>440 Mass. 684, 694 (2004). The defendant\u2019s argument that these errors warrant a reversal of his conviction is unavailing. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Vuthy Seng, </em>436 Mass. 537, 556, cert, denied, 537 U.S. 942 (2002), <em>S.C., </em>456 Mass. 490 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b847-6\">a. We review the following statements to which the defendant objected to determine whether there was prejudicial error. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Flebotte, supra </em>at 353, quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Peruzzi, </em>15 Mass. App. Ct. 437, 445 (1983), (error nonprejudicial if \u201cthe conviction is sure that the error did not influence the jury, or had but very slight effect\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b847-7\">First, the defendant challenges the prosecutor\u2019s remark that the victim was \u201cbegging for her life.\u201d The prosecutor stated, \u201cHow would [the witness] know that [the defendant] was using those words to describe how he killed her and the method he killed her when she\u2019s essentially begging for her life? And how [the witness] then talked about the number of blows.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b847-8\">In closing argument, \u201c[prosecutors are entitled to marshal the evidence and suggest inferences that the jury may draw from it.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Drayton, </em>386 Mass. 39, 52 (1982). Those inferences need only be reasonable and possible. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Casale, </em>381 Mass. 167, 173 (1980). Here, the prosecutor\u2019s closing remarks were based on a witness\u2019s testimony that the defendant mimicked the victim\u2019s repeated request to go home while he was shaking her and beating her. There was no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-9\">We also find no merit in the defendant\u2019s assertion that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"830\">*830</page-number>prosecutor\u2019s remarks concerning the rug were error because no rug was found and there was no testimony as to the buoyancy or the decomposition of the rug. The prosecutor stated, \u201c[W]hy would a rug if you rolled it up, throw it in the water, why would that sink to the bottom? Why? . . . Everything is buoyancy. Clothing or something of that type of material, maybe eventually over time it will sink down.\u201d With this statement, the prosecutor refers to the testimony concerning the braided rug made from natural fibers that the defendant threw into the quarry. It is not an unreasonable inference that this type of rug, thrown into water, would decompose over time.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-5\">The defendant also challenges the prosecutor\u2019s use of one witness\u2019s testimony about the rug, specifically that the defendant and the witness moved the rug out of the truck, and that the defendant moved the rug further into the water. The prosecutor\u2019s statement is firmly based on the witness\u2019s testimony. If there were conflicting inferences that could be made from that witness\u2019s testimony, \u201cit is for the jury to determine where the truth lies.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lao, </em>443 Mass. 770, 779 (2005). The prosecutor\u2019s statement was not error.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-6\">Citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Coren, </em>437 Mass. 723, 732 (2002), the defendant asserts that it was prejudicial error for the prosecutor to employ hypothetical dialogue that showed the defendant\u2019s hostility toward the victim. He challenges the prosecutor\u2019s statement, \u201c[The victim\u2019s] out there working. And of course what does she get when she comes home? Hostility. \u2018Who you seeing? Who you talking to? Who you doing this with?\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b848-7\">Hypothetical dialogue is prejudicial where it goes to the heart of the case and is not based on evidence offered at trial. <em>Id. </em>at 732-733. Here, the prosecutor relayed testimony that, after the victim moved back to her mother\u2019s home, the defendant asked the victim\u2019s sister questions about the victim\u2019s whereabouts, whom the victim was with, and what the victim was wearing. The prosecutor\u2019s dialogue is nearly identical to the testimony of the victim\u2019s sister. Further, the prosecutor\u2019s references to the defendant\u2019s hostility can be reasonably inferred from evidence of the violence that the defendant exhibited toward the victim and the defendant\u2019s admission that he was jealous of other men <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"831\">*831</page-number>whom the victim dated.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The prosecutor\u2019s statements remained properly grounded in the evidence. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cor-riveau, </em>396 Mass. 319, 337 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b849-5\">The defendant objected at trial to the prosecutor\u2019s statement that the defendant was one of two people who knew \u201cprecisely how it happened that day in the field.\u201d The defendant\u2019s argument that the statement shifted the burden of proof to the defendant is unpersuasive because the defendant told police that he had met the victim in the field the day of her disappearance. Moreover, the judge issued multiple instructions on the presumption of innocence and the Commonwealth\u2019s burden to prove the elements of the crime, which would have cured any potential prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-6\">b. Concerning the remaining challenges to the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument to which the defendant did not object, we review for a substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ortiz, supra. </em>The defendant argues, in essence, that the statements that follow are \u201cuntrue\u201d or mis-characterizations of evidence in contravention of <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kozec, </em>399 Mass. 514, 516 (1987) (in closing argument, prosecutor should not misstate evidence).</p>\n<p id=\"b849-7\">\u201cCounsel may . . . attempt to assist the jury in their task of analyzing, evaluating, and applying evidence. Such assistance includes suggestions by counsel as to what conclusions the jury should draw from the evidence.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ferreira, </em>381 Mass. 306, 316 (1980). We review the prosecutor\u2019s argument in the context of the whole argument and the jury instructions.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Phillips, </em>452 Mass. 617, 630 (2008). We note that most of the defendant\u2019s arguments concerning the prosecutor\u2019s statements are premised on our accepting an inference more favorable to the defendant, not on what constitutes permissible argument. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kozec, supra. </em>All of the challenged statements are firmly based in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"832\">*832</page-number>evidence. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pope, </em>406 Mass. 581, 587 (1990) (prosecutors must tailor remarks to ensure they remain properly grounded in evidence).</p>\n<p id=\"b850-5\">The prosecutor stated that the victim was \u201cscared\u201d and \u201cbarefoot\u201d when, at some point, she left the apartment that she shared with the defendant. This remark is based on testimony that a witness saw her not wearing shoes and that her demeanor was \u201cagitated, nervous, upset,\u201d as well as other testimony that the victim was afraid when the defendant beat her. Moreover, even if this had been error, the prosecutor\u2019s comment would not have produced undue sympathy or bias that rises to a substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice given all the evidence of the couple\u2019s volatile relationship. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mar-quetty, </em>416 Mass. 445, 451 (1993) (\u201cwe assume that the jury have a reasonable measure of sophistication and are capable of sorting out hyperbole\u201d). There was no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-6\">The prosecutor\u2019s statement that the defendant, but not the victim, was interested in continuing their relationship is based on evidence of the defendant\u2019s own admissions. In particular, the defendant told police that he believed the couple was \u201cworking] things out,\u201d but the victim \u201cwasn\u2019t interested in getting back together.\u201d The jury also could have inferred that the victim did not wish to continue the relationship based on the victim\u2019s move from the apartment she shared with the defendant to her mother\u2019s home, and the defendant\u2019s violence toward her. The prosecutor\u2019s remarks were based in evidence, and the prosecutor was merely \u201carguing what conclusion the jury should draw from the evidence.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ruiz, </em>442 Mass. 826, 837 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b850-7\">We likewise find no error in the prosecutor\u2019s characterization of the violence in the relationship as \u201cbrutality.\u201d The defendant would like to characterize his pushing the victim against the wall and hitting her as a \u201cscuffle,\u201d a word used by a witness to describe another incident. It is the jury\u2019s duty to determine which parts of a witness\u2019s testimony are credible. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Deane, </em>458 Mass. 43, 52 (2010). Given the defendant\u2019s own statement that he \u201cused to beat [the victim] before, when he was drunk,\u201d evidence the defendant cut up the victim\u2019s clothes, and the testimony about the couple\u2019s violent arguments, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"833\">*833</page-number>the prosecutor\u2019s statements are fairly inferable and fall within the permissible scope of a prosecutor\u2019s closing remarks. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Raymond, </em>424 Mass. 382, 389-390 (1997) (suffering of victim relevant to whether defendant\u2019s actions constituted extreme atrocity or cruelty).</p>\n<p id=\"b851-5\">There is also no merit in the defendant\u2019s claims that the prosecutor\u2019s characterizations of the defendant \u201clur[ing]\u201d the victim to the field, lying in wait for her because he \u201cknew what was going to come,\u201d misrepresent the evidence. The defendant told the police that he had telephoned the victim, asking her to meet him in the field, and that while he was waiting, he was lying down with his head propped up on his elbows. There was no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-6\">The defendant challenges the prosecutor\u2019s statement that \u201c[the defendant] gets arrested for [an altercation with the police]. It\u2019s important. It\u2019s important because later on when he\u2019s telling everybody about why he\u2019s running, he\u2019s suggesting that somehow it has to do with the police. . . . Well, you heard from the clerk of the court. There was no warrant on him .... There was no process issued for him after February 25th of 1986.\u201d The defendant argues there is another interpretation of the evidence, namely, that the police were \u201cout to get him.\u201d Because of this alternate interpretation, he argues, the prosecutor\u2019s closing remarks were in error. We disagree. Here, the prosecutor recounted the testimony of the victim\u2019s sister that the defendant arrived at her house and stated that \u201cthe cops [were] after [him],\u201d even before the victim\u2019s sister knew her sister had disappeared, indicating consciousness of guilt. It is the jury\u2019s duty to determine \u201cwhere the truth lies,\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lao, </em>443 Mass. 770, 779 (2005), and the prosecutor\u2019s statement was not error.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-7\">The defendant also challenges the prosecutor\u2019s statement that the defendant dragged the victim\u2019s body to the culvert while it was still daylight. A prosecutor may argue forcefully \u201cfor a conviction based on the evidence and on inferences that may reasonably be drawn from the evidence.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kozec, </em>399 Mass. 514, 516 (1987). Based on the evidence of the victim\u2019s sneakers and socks discovered in the culvert, the jury could have reasonably inferred that the defendant moved the victim to the culvert to hide her, particularly because the victim had met the defendant around noon.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"834\">*834</page-number>Next, the defendant claims that the prosecutor disparaged the defense\u2019s argument and appealed to the jury\u2019s emotions when he stated, \u201cSexual assault? What\u2019s the evidence of that? . . . Some weird crazy guy pops in that day, kills her, and then, okay, presumably leaves the body. Why take it ten miles? . . . Who says later on he made her disappear? Who says that? This unknown crazy rapist that\u2019s running around?\u201d We presume the jury recognize the prosecutor\u2019s role as an advocate, not a witness. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mitchell, </em>428 Mass. 852, 857 (1999). The prosecutor\u2019s statement responds to defense counsel\u2019s suggestion that the victim had been sexually assaulted and killed by someone other than the defendant. He referenced the defendant\u2019s admission that he threw the victim in a \u201cbottomless pit,\u201d reasonably inferred as the quarry in Dartmouth where the victim\u2019s body was found. Even if the remarks were embellishment, they were merely \u201cexcusable hyperbole\u201d in light of the entire argument and do not provide grounds for reversal. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sanna, </em>424 Mass. 92, 107 (1997).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b852-5\">The defendant objects to the prosecutor\u2019s statement, \u201cYou need to consider all of the evidence, the evidence, not the supposition. Did you hear any evidence about needing a permit to run a truck up and down [Route] 195 on Easter Sunday? So why are we hearing that? That\u2019s not evidence.\u201d The defendant argues that the prosecutor\u2019s remarks were not based on evidence. Here, the prosecutor references the testimony of the witness who drove the defendant to the quarry on March 30,1986 (Easter Sunday), with the braided rug in the back of the truck. The witness testified that while he and the defendant were driving to the quarry, they saw a commercial vehicle on the highway. During cross-examination, defense counsel elicited testimony from a police officer that one would need a permit to operate a commercial vehicle before 6 p.m. on a holiday such as Easter. The defendant suggests that the witness\u2019s credibility was at issue because the witness testified that he saw a commercial truck on the highway on a day when that truck would need a permit to operate. \u201cEvaluations of credibility are. . . within the exclusive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"835\">*835</page-number>province of the trier of fact.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bohannon, </em>376 Mass. 90, 94 (1978), <em>S.C., </em>385 Mass. 733 (1982). When the prosecutor told the jury, \u201cThat\u2019s not evidence,\u201d he may have referred to evidence proving or disproving the defendant\u2019s guilt. The prosecutor\u2019s remarks are based in evidence, and there was no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-5\">Finally, the defendant objects to the prosecutor\u2019s remarks concerning the white pullover sweatshirt recovered in a wooded area similar to the one the victim wore on the day of her disappearance: \u201cThat coat. Consider this. That got stuffed, buried somewhere. There\u2019s dirt on it. Somebody knew the significance to this case, the same way [a witness] when she saw it knew it, and somebody didn\u2019t want to be involved, meaning call up the police and say . . . T just found a coat here,\u2019 but they wanted it to be found.\u201d The defendant argues that this statement intimates that the defendant \u201cstuffed\u201d the sweatshirt somewhere. However, regarding the phrase \u201cgot stuffed, buried somewhere,\u201d the prosecutor referred to one witness\u2019s testimony that the sweatshirt was found in an open area where it could be seen easily. The evidence indicates that the witness would have found it earlier had the sweatshirt been visible, so an inference that the sweatshirt was hidden, or \u201cstuffed\u201d somewhere, is reasonable. Second, the prosecutor\u2019s remarks concerning the dirt on the sweatshirt is a reasonable inference based on the sweatshirt itself, which was in evidence. These statements do not constitute error.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-6\">5. <em>Instruction on \u201cdangerous </em>weapon.\u201d During his instruction to the jury on the Commonwealth\u2019s burden to prove the elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt, the judge stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b853-7\">\u201cIn relation to malice, follow this instruction as to the use of a dangerous weapon. As a general rule, you the jury are permitted, but not required, to infer that a person who intentionally uses a dangerous weapon on another human being is acting with malice. A dangerous weapon is an item which is capable of causing serious injury or death. Excluded from the definition of a dangerous weapon is any part of the human body, such as a hand, a foot, or any other part of the body.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b854-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"836\">*836</page-number>The defendant contends that the judge\u2019s charge was error because, in essence, it allowed the jury to conclude that the defendant used a weapon. He argues that the prejudice was magnified because of the circumstances of the victim\u2019s death, the medical examiner\u2019s improper testimony, and the jury\u2019s sympathies, all of which led them to conclude that the defendant murdered the victim with malice.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-4\">Because the defendant did not object at trial, we review to determine whether there was a substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dostie, </em>425 Mass. 372, 374 (1997). We determine whether there was error in a charge by \u201creading the charge as a whole, and not by scrutinizing bits and pieces removed from their context.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cundriff, </em>382 Mass. 137, 153 (1980), cert, denied, 451 U.S. 973 (1981). Here, the judge\u2019s instructions clearly told the jury that making inferences was permissible but not required. Given the evidence of the victim\u2019s fractured skull, the medical examiner\u2019s testimony that \u201cconsiderable force\u201d was needed to inflict that fracture, and that the fractures to the victim\u2019s skull and jaw were on the same side of the body, this instruction was proper. Additionally, the jury could have inferred from the defendant\u2019s request that his friend dispose of one specific cinder block approximately one month after the victim disappeared that the cinder block may have been the \u201cconsiderable force\u201d applied to the victim\u2019s head. There was no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-5\">6. <em>Cumulative effect of errors. </em>The defendant argues that his conviction requires reversal because of the cumulative effect of the errors at trial. Given our conclusions, there was no risk that any error requires reversal. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Guy, </em>441 Mass. 96, 109 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b854-6\">7. <em>Relief pursuant to G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E. </em>We have reviewed the entire record as required by G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E, and we see no reason to reduce the murder conviction or order a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-7\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b837-8\">lThe Commonwealth also had proceeded under a theory of deliberate premeditation, but the jury did not find the defendant guilty under that theory.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b837-9\">The defendant and the victim frequently argued and had physical altercations.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b838-8\">While walking to the culvert, the victim\u2019s sister noticed footprints. One set of footprints had the imprint of a Nike brand sneaker, and the other set had a clover imprint similar to that of the defendant\u2019s boots. The prints were side by side until one set ended. When the area was secured, however, the prints were not distinguishable.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b838-9\">When police tested the stain for human blood in 1986, the result was positive, but when the stain was retested in 2007, the test for human blood was inconclusive. A State police criminologist testified that the negative results were unsurprising because blood decomposes over time. In 2007, a partial deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) profile from saliva was taken from a stamp <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"821\">*821</page-number>recovered from a letter the victim had sent to a friend, and compared with the sample from the jacket. This test showed that the DNA from the stain on the jacket matched the DNA on the stamp. One in 16,480 unrelated people in the Caucasian population would be expected to have the same partial profile as that on the stamp and the jacket. The statistical analysis of the DNA testing was presented to the jury. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lanigan, </em>419 Mass. 15, 20 (1994) (evidence of DNA match \u201cmeaningless without evidence indicating the significance of the match\u201d). The defendant does not contest the DNA evidence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b840-7\">Based on the victim\u2019s dental records, a forensic odontologist identified the jaw and skull as those of the victim.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b840-8\">The day of her disappearance, the victim was wearing a navy blue rugby shirt with a white collar and jogging pants.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b840-9\">The medical examiner\u2019s duties were made more difficult because of the decomposition of the victim\u2019s body.

Prior to the presentation of evidence, the judge instructed the jury on circumstantial evidence and the need to make reasonable inferences based on the evidence. During the trial, the judge stated, \u201cThis case is going to go through a number of days, and you\u2019re going to hear testimony from a lot of people. You\u2019re going to see a lot of exhibits. And it\u2019s at the end of the case that you look at any linkages, if there are linkages, and then I will instruct you on what I refer to as drawing reasonable inferences.\u201d He also instructed the jury that an inference must be based in evidence that the jury believes, and that the inference must be \u201creasonable, and as such, not a guess.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b844-7\">The portion of the telephone call in the recording admitted at trial is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b844-8\">The caller: \u201cAll right.
