The defendant sought to vacate his plea because he did not knowingly and voluntarily admit to sufficient facts where no interpreter was present during his plea colloquy and where he was denied effective assistance of counsel. The Appeals Court, in a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>memorandum and order issued pursuant to its rule 1:28, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Yardley Y., </em>79 Mass. App. Ct. 1123 (2011), affirmed the denial of the defendant\u2019s motion. Because the defendant did not provide sufficient evidence to rebut the presumption of regularity of his plea proceedings and did not demonstrate he was denied the effective assistance of counsel, we affirm the denial of the defendant\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-5\"><em>Facts and procedure. </em>We present the facts as found by the judge, supplemented by uncontested facts in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-6\">The defendant and his mother, Cambodian refugees and native Khmai speakers, came to the United States when the defendant was four years old.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In 1995, when the defendant was fourteen years old, he was living at a Buddhist monastery with Cambodian monks in Amherst, where Khmai, rather than English, was generally spoken. On August 2, 1995, a complaint issued from the Hampshire County Division of the Juvenile Court Department charging the defendant with assault and battery by means of a dangerous weapon and indecent assault and battery on a child under the age of fourteen.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b242-7\">It appears that, related to these charges, the defendant\u2019s need for an interpreter was recognized. The docket shows that interpreters were ordered for certain court dates, although no entry on the docket indicates that interpreters were actually present when scheduled. Thus when the defendant\u2019s case was continued from September 12 to September 19, 1995, the docket shows that the judge rescheduled an interpreter for the new date.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b242-8\">Ultimately, the defendant admitted to sufficient facts on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>October 17, 1995, and was placed on probation. The court\u2019s record of the defendant\u2019s plea colloquy is a stamp that states \u201cColloquy Given_Tender of Plea or Admission Form Filed and Waiver Signed\u201d with the blank line left blank. The docket indicates an interpreter was ordered for the defendant\u2019s October 17, 1995, court date, as well as for the November 21, 1995, court date set for disposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-7\">In 1996, the defendant was committed to the Department of Youth Services (DYS) after he violated the terms of his probation. In 2009, the defendant, as an adult, sought to vacate his pleas, asserting that no interpreter had been present at his plea hearing, and therefore he was denied the assistance of his parent, and that his counsel did not provide effective assistance. In the affidavit that he submitted in support of his motion, the defendant stated that he did not understand that he was admitting to a sexual offense, did not know what a trial was, had spoken to his mother in court in Khmai, did not remember speaking to an attorney until the day of his plea, and did not remember an interpreter ever being in court with him and his mother.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-8\">The defendant\u2019s mother submitted an affidavit stating that, at the time of the defendant\u2019s plea colloquy, she did not read or write English. She also stated that no interpreter was present to help her during court proceedings, although \u201c[t]here was someone translating for the other family . . . but he would not help [her].\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The victim also submitted an affidavit.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The defense attorney representing the defendant in 1995 did not provide an affidavit or other information about the specifics of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-9\">As evidence he did not understand his guilty plea, the defendant included a 1996 report by DYS, as well as a 1996 educational report discussing his educational skills. The educational report <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>states that his school attendance had been infrequent while he had lived in the United States, and that the defendant was \u201csignificantly below grade level\" with \u201cserious gaps in all subject matters.\u201d The report also stated that the defendant\u2019s reading was weakest \u201cin the areas of decoding and vocabulary . . . when reading subject material\u201d and that the defendant sometimes needed assistance with tasks that were at the fourth or fifth grade level.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-8\">After conducting a hearing, the judge, who had also been the plea judge, denied the defendant\u2019s motion. She found that the practice for recording the presence of interpreters was that an interpreter would be ordered, and proceedings would be continued if the interpreter was not there. She stated that the court has never documented and is not bound to document the presence of an interpreter. The judge also stated that, as a matter of practice, she adapts the colloquy given to juveniles to \u201cabout a sixth-grade</p>\n<p id=\"b244-16\">The judge noted disparities in the affidavits concerning the presence of an interpreter, including the statement of the defendant\u2019s mother that someone in the court room was interpreting, but not for her. The judge had \u201ca very hard time with the affidavits and relying on them to support [the defendant\u2019s] position.\u201d The judge found that, based on the record and the affidavits, the defendant failed to prove he was not provided an interpreter, and therefore did not prove he lacked understanding or knowledge when he admitted to sufficient facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-25\">The defendant moved for reconsideration. At the hearing on that motion, the defendant introduced an affidavit from the chief financial officer of the Committee for Public Counsel Services (CPCS) stating that the organization\u2019s financial records indicate that counsel was appointed for the defendant in 1995. The records do not show, however, any payment for the defendant\u2019s representation. The affidavit also states there is no indication that CPCS paid for interpreter services for this case. The judge found that the missing financial accounting did not change the balance. The judge stated that the law presumes pleas are voluntary, and noted, as she had previously, that the affidavits demonstrated that there was someone in the court room interpreting during the plea proceedings. The Appeals Court affirmed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>the denial of the motion; however, the court acknowledged that one member of the panel raised concerns that the defendant did not receive the adult or parental guidance that our cases have indicated should be available when a child waives fundamental rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-5\"><em>Discussion. </em>A defendant may withdraw a guilty plea where the plea was not made freely and voluntarily. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Sherman, 451 Mass. 332, 335 (2008), citing <em>Boykin </em>v. <em>Alabama, </em>395 U.S. 238, 242-243 (1969). The appropriate method to challenge a plea is a motion for a new trial, which the judge has the discretion to allow or deny. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sherman, supra </em>at 334. We review under an abuse of discretion standard. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Burgos, </em>462 Mass. 53, 60 (2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b245-6\">When accepting a plea, a judge must be \u201csatisfied that the plea [was] voluntary and that the defendant [understood] the nature of the charges.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Quinones, </em>414 Mass. 423, 431 (1993). This court has recognized that, in the context of rights under the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution, \u201cjuveniles frequently lack the capacity to appreciate the consequences of their actions and [the law] seeks to protect them from the possible consequences of their immaturity.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. A <em>Juvenile, </em>389 Mass. 128, 135 (1983) (juvenile did not voluntarily waive Miranda rights). Where a juvenile is fourteen or older, \u201cthere should ordinarily be a meaningful consultation with the parent, interested adult, or attorney\u201d to ensure the juvenile has knowingly and intelligently waived a right. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>MacNeill, </em>399 Mass. 71, 77-78 (1987), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. A <em>Juvenile, supra </em>at 134 (juvenile had opportunity to consult with \u201csufficiently interested\u201d adult, his grandparent, about waiving Fifth Amendment rights).</p>\n<p id=\"b245-7\">Generally, the prosecution bears the burden to show that a defendant understandingly and voluntarily pleaded guilty, but where there is a delay \u201cfor a lengthy period of time, so that the contemporaneous record of the plea is lost,\u201d the burden shifts to the defendant, who must rebut the presumption that he had a fair trial. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lopez, </em>426 Mass. 657, 660-661 (1998). In challenging his plea, the defendant must \u201cprovide sufficient credible and reliable factual evidence\u201d to overcome the presumption that the judge properly conducted his plea proceeding. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number><em>Id. </em>at 663. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Gautreaux, 458 Mass. 741, 754 (2011) (where motion for new trial filed more than five years after plea and tape recording of proceedings destroyed, burden on defendant to rebut presumption of regularity).</p>\n<p id=\"b246-8\">The defendant claims that the judge did not adhere to G. L. c. 221C, which mandates the court provide an interpreter to a non-English speaker.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> He claims that the affidavits, the lack of financial documentation showing payment to the defense at-tomey or an interpreter, the Juvenile Court docket, and documents from DYS and a tutor constitute sufficient evidence to rebut the presumption that an interpreter was present.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> We disagree. The record demonstrates that, at the time of the defendant\u2019s 1995 adjudication, the judge recognized that the defendant may have had difficulty speaking or understanding the English language; accordingly, she ordered an interpreter for the defendant on multiple court dates. We conclude that the judge did not abuse her discretion in finding that the practice in her court room was to continue a case in the absence of an interpreter to ensure a defendant understands court proceedings.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The fact that interpreters were ordered for the defendant\u2019s other court dates supports the judge\u2019s finding that an interpreter was ordered the day of the defendant\u2019s plea hearing. The judge used her discretion properly when she relied on her own general practice and the court\u2019s general practice of docketing.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> See <em>Commonwealth </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>v. <em>Quinones, supra </em>at 432 (\u201cWe see no impropriety ... in relying on a judge\u2019s customary practice in taking guilty pleas to reconstruct the record\u201d). Moreover, the judge appropriately considered the affidavits and found them inadequate to support the defendant\u2019s assertion that he had no interpreter. There was no abuse of discretion. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lopez, supra </em>(judge may rule on motion based on affidavits or may discredit untrustworthy affidavits).</p>\n<p id=\"b247-5\">The defendant\u2019s argument that, absent an interpreter, he did not have the opportunity to speak with an informed adult also does not hold sway. When a juvenile is fourteen or older and waiving a constitutional right, he should have a consultation with \u201cthe parent, interested adult, <em>or </em>attorney\u201d (emphasis supplied). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>MacNeill, supra </em>at 78. Even if the judge had fully accepted the defendant\u2019s and his mother\u2019s affidavit, the defendant stated that he spoke to an attorney on the day he pleaded to sufficient facts. He also stated that he spoke to his mother in Khmai in court, when she asked what was happening. Thus, the record indicates that he had an opportunity to speak with at least one interested adult, his attorney,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and also communicated with his mother, another interested adult. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Tevenal, </em>401 Mass. 225, 227 (1987) (although juvenile\u2019s mother did not speak English and no court interpreter was present, juvenile had opportunity to consult with his mother and other family members).</p>\n<p id=\"AfI\">The defendant also asserts that, even if an interpreter had been present, he could not have knowingly and voluntarily pleaded to sufficient facts because of his lack of competency, as evidenced in his 1996 educational report. Even if we did not presume the regularity of the proceedings, the record does not indicate the defendant\u2019s competency was in question. The educational report, written almost eight months after the defendant\u2019s plea, states that the defendant lacked subject matter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>knowledge, needed assistance with small tasks, and had difficulty comprehending some of the course reading, particularly in subjects where the defendant lacked the vocabulary and decoding skills to understand. Although the defendant argues that the educational report \u201craises doubts that he possessed the necessary cognitive abilities\u201d knowingly and voluntarily to waive his rights, the report neither indicates that the defendant possessed delayed or diminished cognitive abilities nor suggests that he was legally incompetent at the time of the plea.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Further, we give due deference to the judge, who properly used her discretion to determine whether the defendant pleaded knowingly and voluntarily at the time of his plea. See <em>Commonwealth v. Quino-nes, supra </em>at 431.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-5\">The defendant\u2019s second claim is that he should be granted a new trial because he was denied effective assistance of counsel. He argues that counsel took \u201cno discernible action to protect [the defendant\u2019s] rights,\u201d including not conducting a competency hearing, not requesting funds for an investigator, not assessing the defendant\u2019s language ability, and failing to file appropriate motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-6\">The defendant bears the burden to show that he is entitled to a new trial based on a claim that he was denied effective assistance of counsel. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Comita, </em>441 Mass. 86, 90 (2004). Where counsel\u2019s conduct falls \u201cbelow that which might be expected from an ordinary fallible lawyer\u201d and if that conduct prejudiced the defendant by depriving him \u201cof an otherwise available, substantial ground of defence,\u201d counsel has not provided effective assistance. <em>Commonwealth v. Saferian, </em>366 Mass. 89, 96 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b248-7\">Here, the defendant brings this claim more than ten years after he pleaded to sufficient facts, and the existing record is</p>\n<p id=\"b249-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>limited at best. There is no information about the defense attorney\u2019s actions except for docket entries and the affidavits of the defendant, his mother, and the victim in the case.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The defendant offered no other evidence to support this assertion, such as an affidavit from the defense attorney documenting the attorney\u2019s efforts for this case. We conclude that the defendant has not met his burden to show that defense counsel did not act with the advocacy of an ordinary fallible lawyer. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fenton F., </em>442 Mass. 31, 40-41 (2004) (no ineffective assistance of counsel where defense attorney recommended that defendant accept plea offer).</p>\n<p id=\"b249-5\">\n<em>Order denying motion for a new trial affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b242-9\">We reference the \u201cKhmai,\u201d not \u201cKhmer,\u201d language because, in his affidavit, the defendant states his native language is Khmai.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b242-10\">The charge of indecent assault and battery on a child under the age of fourteen that the defendant admitted to, and for which he subsequently had to register with the sex offender registry board, was for \u201cgrabbing] [the victim\u2019s] front parts.\u201d The victim, another Cambodian young man, later filed an affidavit in support of the defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial in which he recanted his allegation. See <em>infra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b242-11\">The docket comprises nearly the entire record in this case because the actual case file could not be located in the Judicial Court archives and tape recordings of the proceedings are inaccessible. We have accepted in the past that unavailable court material presumably has been destroyed in accordance with court rules. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Grant, </em>426 Mass. 667, 670 (1998) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>(tape recordings of plea proceedings erased \u201cpresumably pursuant to Rule 211 [A] [4] of the Special Rules of the District Courts [1997]\u201d); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pingaro, </em>44 Mass. App. Ct. 41, 43 (1997), citing S.J.C. Rule 1:12, as appearing in 382 Mass. 717 [1981]).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b243-11\">In her affidavit, the defendant\u2019s mother also stated that her son\u2019s attorney did not speak Khmai, that she did not understand the judge while in court, and that she believed her son was in court because of tattooing, not because of a sexual offense.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b243-12\">An affidavit submitted by the victim states that the defendant had not sexually assaulted him, did not force him to join a gang, and did not force him to get a tattoo.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b246-28\">General Laws c. 221C, \u00a7 2, provides that a \u201cnon-English speaker, throughout a legal proceeding, shall have a right to the assistance of a qualified interpreter.\u201d The statute defines a \u201cnon-English speaker\u201d as \u201ca person who cannot speak or understand, or has difficulty in speaking or understanding, the English language because he uses only or primarily a spoken language other than English.\u201d G. L. c. 221C, \u00a7 1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b246-29\">In his brief, the defendant cites articles from law journals and other sources concerning juveniles involved in the court system. The defendant also referenees reports concerning interpreters in courts. According to one report, as of October, 2000, there were only three certified Khmer interpreters and one uncertified Khmer interpreter employed in Massachusetts courts. National Center for State Courts, Operational Review of the Provision of Court Interpreter Services in the Courts of Massachusetts: Technical Assistance Report at 21 (2001). Because this report speaks generally to the court system, not to the specifics of this case, it does not assist the defendant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b246-30\">As discussed <em>supra, </em>the docket shows that, when the defendant\u2019s court date was changed, the judge issued a new order for an interpreter.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b246-31\">We agree with judge\u2019s statement that there was no requirement to docket the presence of an interpreter.

We reiterate our support for such a modification.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b247-7\">The defendant claims the attorney was not competent, but we do not agree. See <em>infra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b248-8\">In his brief, the defendant cited to law review articles and other journal articles to support his view that juveniles may not necessarily know or understand proceedings in court because of their age. We appreciate and understand the \u201cunique and protected status\u201d of juveniles, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>A Juvenile, </em>389 Mass. 128, 132 (1983). However, we defer to the judge who bears the responsibility to ensure the defendant has made a knowing and voluntary waiver. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Quinones, </em>414 Mass. 423, 431 (1993). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cain, </em>361 Mass. 224, 228 (1972) (court must use \u201cspecial caution\u201d when reviewing juvenile\u2019s decision to waive a right).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b249-6\">In her affidavit, appellate counsel averred that the defense attorney did not recall the case.
