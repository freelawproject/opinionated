Historically, two families \u2014 the Nortons (plaintiffs) and the Flynns (defendants)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> \u2014 have owned the property upland from the beach. For much of the past century, the two families enjoyed a friendly relationship and both families <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>used the beach. That relationship deteriorated in the early 1980s, and a dispute arose as to title rights to the beach. In 2004, the Nortons commenced an action in the Land Court to quiet title, ultimately claiming that they owned a fractional interest in the beach or, in the alternative, enjoyed a prescriptive easement to use it and certain land leading to it.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-5\">The Nortons\u2019 claimed title interest in the beach dates to an 1841 deed, which created the beach parcel. There is no dispute that, due to the erosion of Martha\u2019s Vineyard\u2019s southern shoreline, the beach as it existed in 1841, and even as late as 1938, is now submerged beneath the Atlantic Ocean. The Flynns claim that the Nortons have no interest in the beach as it is presently located because their title is only to the beach as it existed in 1841. The Nortons, however, contend that the deeds from which they derive their fractional interest in the beach conveyed rights in a moveable beach parcel that shifts upland with the northerly migration of the beach.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> A Land Court judge rejected this argument and granted summary judgment for the Flynns on the title claim. At a jury-waived trial on the Nortons\u2019 alternative claim that they held a prescriptive easement to use the beach and certain land by which to access it, the judge determined that the Nortons had not met their burden of establishing a prescriptive easement. Judgment entered from which the Nortons timely appealed, and we granted the plaintiffs\u2019 application for direct appellate review.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b420-6\">We affirm that portion of the judgment declaring that the Nortons do not have a title interest in the beach as it exists <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>today, since their title interest is to a beach now submerged under the Atlantic Ocean. Because we conclude that the judge\u2019s findings of fact are insufficient to permit appellate review of so much of the judgment as concerns the prescriptive easement claim, we vacate that portion of the judgment and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-5\">1. <em>Background, </em>a. <em>The Flynns and the Nortons. </em>For much of the twentieth century, the Flynns and the Nortons were the sole owners of the property in the southwestern comer of Edgartown where the beach is located. George D. Flynn, Jr. (Uncle George) and Winthrop B. Norton (Sonny) were the respective heads of these families from roughly 1950 through the early 1980s. Uncle George and Sonny were friends and generally permitted each other use of their respective properties. After Sonny\u2019s death in 1981, the Norton family undertook to sell certain parcels of their property; those parcels included purported fractional ownership interests in the beach and prescriptive rights to access the beach over certain portions of the Flynns\u2019 property. While expressing doubt that the Nortons in fact held any conveyable ownership interests in the beach, the Flynns took no action to stop the sales. In 1983, Richard Friedman purchased one such parcel.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Thereafter, he frequently rode on horseback over large portions of the Flynn property, apparently maintaining that he had the right to do so notwithstanding requests by members of both the Flynn and Norton families that he desist. A decade of negotiations and this litigation followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-6\">b. <em>Title history. </em>The first record title to the beach dates to 1693, when Wonnottaqunnamon, Squaw Sachim, and Jacob Washaman conveyed to Captain John Butler \u201ccertain lands, beach and meadow lands, on said Martha\u2019s Vineyard; bounded from the place commonly opened at Crackatuxett, on the east, the opening to the westward of Pokhoganett on the west; the sea on the south; and the pond, or ponds, on the north.\u201d In 1712, Butler conveyed to Captain Samuel Smith \u201ca certain parcell of Beach,\u201d defined as a part of the property which was conveyed in the 1693 conveyance that mns \u201cfrom Watsha open<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>ing and from thence As Sd. Beach Runs Eastward Till It Comes To A Opening between Against Job\u2019s Neck and Poghonet.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b422-5\">In 1752, Captain Smith conveyed this parcel to his son Samuel \u201cTarsha\u201d Smith (Tarsha), along with his title interests to the adjacent upland properties Paqua and Pohogonot.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Upon his death in 1796, Tarsha conveyed his interests by will equally to his sons Wilmot Smith (Wilmot) and Samuel Smith (Samuel), as tenants in common. In 1841, Wilmot and Samuel\u2019s eight heirs, Samuel having died, undertook to separate their ownership interests. In a series of sequentially recorded conveyances, the Smith property was divided into three distinct parcels (the beach, Paqua, and Pohogonot), and then ownership was reallocated among members of the Smith family. Wilmot conveyed all of his interest in the beach and Paqua to his four nephews; all eight of Samuel\u2019s heirs conveyed their interests in Pohogonot to Wilmot. As a result of these conveyances, Wilmot owned all of Pohogonot, but none of the beach or Paqua, while Samuel\u2019s heirs owned all of Paqua and the beach, but none of Pohogonot.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-6\">The Nortons derive their claimed interest in the beach from Josiah H. Smith, one of Samuel\u2019s heirs. In 1888, Allen Norton, great-grandfather of the plaintiff Allen W. Norton, conveyed all of his interest in Paqua to Edmund G. Beetle, but retained his fractional interest in the beach. This fractional interest in the beach has passed down through the Norton family and been divided and conveyed to the plaintiffs.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The Flynns derive their fractional interest in the beach from the other seven heirs of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>Samuel Smith. This interest has passed down through the Flynn family and been divided and conveyed to the defendants.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b423-5\">c. <em>Eroding shoreline. </em>The southern shoreline of Martha\u2019s Vineyard is, and has been, eroding, resulting in a northerly migration of the beach. Geological surveys indicate that, in 1846, five years after the beach parcel was created by the 1841 conveyances among Samuel\u2019s heirs and Wilmot, the beach was abutted to the north by Oyster Pond, Paqua Pond, and Job\u2019s Neck Pond, and the uplands of Paqua and Pohogonot.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> From 1846 to 2005, the shoreline eroded at a rate of roughly five feet per year near the western boundary of the beach, and at a rate of approximately seven feet per year near its eastern boundary. As a result of this erosion, the area on which the beach was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>located as recently as 1938 has been entirely covered by the Atlantic Ocean. The beach is located currently on property that was formerly portions of uplands \u2014 Paqua, Pohogonot, Isaac\u2019s Neck, and Short Point \u2014 and the seaward ends of coastal ponds \u2014 Oyster Pond, Paqua Pond, and Job\u2019s Neck Pond.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b424-5\">2. <em>Title claim. </em>The Nortons maintain that the judge erred in concluding that they do not hold title to any fraction of the beach because the property to which they hold a title interest is now located beneath the Atlantic Ocean. The Nortons do not dispute any material fact, but do contest the judge\u2019s interpretation of the deed from which they derive their interests as creating a beach parcel with a fixed landward boundary. They maintain that their predecessors in title created a beach parcel with a moveable northern boundary that shifts with the landward migration of the beach. The Nortons in essence concede that, if the beach to which they hold title interest was not a moveable parcel, they have no title interest in the beach as presently situated.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-6\">The allowance of a motion for summary judgment is reviewed de novo. <em>Bank of N.Y. </em>v. <em>Bailey, </em>460 Mass. 327, 331 (2011). \u201cThe standard of review of a grant of summary judgment is whether, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party, all material facts have been established and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d <em>Augat, Inc. </em>v. <em>Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., </em>410 Mass. 117, 120 (1991). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>We consider first the common-law principles applicable to littoral properties and then examine the 1841 deed that created the beach parcel.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-5\">a. <em>Common-law principles of littoral property. </em>\u201cThere is well-settled authority for the proposition that littoral (shoreline) boundaries are not fixed, because natural processes of accretion or erosion change them.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> <em>Bergh </em>v. <em>Hines, </em>44 Mass. App. Ct. 590, 592 (1998), citing <em>Phillips </em>v. <em>Rhodes, </em>7 Met. 322, 325 (1843). \u201c[T]he line of ownership [of littoral property] follows the changing water line.\u201d <em>East Boston Co. </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>203 Mass. 68, 75 (1909). \u201cAccretions to land bounding on a river or the sea belong to the owners of the adjoining land.\u201d <em>Allen </em>v. <em>Wood, </em>256 Mass. 343, 349 (1926), citing <em>Deerfield </em>v. <em>Arms, </em>17 Pick. 41, 43 (1835). Conversely, if a body of water moves landward through erosion, littoral property \u201cwill decrease in size in order to keep the water as its boundary, even to the point of ceasing to exist.\u201d Glasscock, Effects of Accretion and Erosion on Coastal Property in the United States, 8 Int\u2019l J. Marine &amp; Coastal L. 135, 136 (1993) (Glasscock). See <em>Lorusso </em>v. <em>Acapesket Improvement Ass\u2019n, </em>408 Mass. 772, 781-782 (1990) (\u201cwhen a parcel of land erodes on one side and forms accretions on another, and the process continues until the original parcel ceases to exist... the lot owner\u2019s proprietary interest in the accreted land mass dissolves\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b425-6\">The considerations underlying this doctrine include: (1) the interest in preserving the water-abutting nature of littoral property; (2) the promotion of stability in title and ownership of property as it concerns newly accreted property; and (3) the equitable principle that a property owner who enjoys the benefit of an increase in property when waterlines shift seaward ought also to bear the burden of a decrease in property when water-ines shift landward. See <em>St. Clair County </em>v. <em>Lovington, </em>90 U.S. (23 Wall.), 46, 68-69 (1874); Glasscock, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b425-7\"><em>A </em>littoral property thus contains a moveable shoreline bound<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>ary, but its other boundaries ordinarily are fixed. See <em>Lorusso </em>v. <em>Acapesket Improvement Ass\u2019n, supra </em>at 780-782. See also JJ. Whittlesey, Law of the Seashore, Tidewaters and Great Ponds in Massachusetts and Maine 53 (1932). Under this doctrine, the Nortons have no interest in the beach as it is presently located, because the beach has eroded beyond the landward boundary set forth in the deed that created their predecessors\u2019 title interest in the beach. See <em>Lorusso </em>v. <em>Acapesket Improvement Ass\u2019n, supra </em>at 782.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-5\">b. <em>Deed analysis. </em>The Nortons assert, however, that their title interest in the beach shifts with its northward trajectory because the deeds in their chain of title contain either no landward (northern) boundary or reference as a landward boundary only moveable natural monuments, thereby creating a moveable parcel. We are not persuaded that the Nortons\u2019 predecessors in title created such an estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-6\">We have not previously addressed whether a littoral property may contain a moveable landward boundary, thus shielding the parcel from the legal effects of erosion.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> A similar moveable beach claim was presented in <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Lakeman, </em>15 Pick. 151, 153 (1833), regarding conveyance of a beach described as a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>\u201chalf a mile of the lower end of the beach, to be measured at highwater mark.\u201d In that case:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b427-4\">\u201c[The defendant] contended that this was a moveable boundary, and that it shifted as the beach was washed away by the sea. But the judge instructed the jury, that the half mile of beach was to be measured as it was when the devisor died, and that it was a fixed and stable freehold. And we all think that instruction was correct. A different rule would be productive of great uncertainty and litigation, and there is nothing in the will from which we can infer that the testator intended that the measurements should not be made as the beach then existed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b427-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 153-154. In an analogous case in New York, the Court of Appeals of New York rejected a claim that a \u201ccliff\u201d serving as the landward boundary of a littoral property, which had since eroded, was intended to be a moveable boundary. See <em>East Hampton </em>v. <em>Kirk, </em>84 N.Y. 215, 218-219 (1881). The court reasoned: \u201cIt would... be an unwarrantable interpretation of the transaction to hold that the cliff mentioned in the [title instrument] was a shifting boundary, so as to entitle the plaintiffs to make reprisal for the land lost by the advance of the sea out of the [upland] lands. The owners of the [upland] lands could gain nothing by accretion. They might lose by the advance of the shore line beyond the point where the cliff was originally located.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 219. More recently, the Court of Chancery of Delaware similarly concluded that landward boundaries of littoral property remain fixed. The court held that, because the upland property owners \u201ccould not enjoy any benefit of accretion, there is no equitable rationale for requiring them to bear the burden of any erosion of the [lake] shore.\u201d <em>Scureman </em>v. <em>Judge, </em>747 A.2d 62, 68 (Del. Ch. 1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b427-6\">As these cases make clear, at least two of the rationales for shifting seaward boundaries, a desire to promote stability in title and ownership of property, and equitable treatment of the risks and rewards borne by littoral property owners, are not applicable to landward boundaries. Indeed, those factors counsel against recognition of moveable landward boundaries. Doing so would result both in instability and confusion as to ownership of property <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>that erodes beyond landward boundaries and in inequitable loss of property for upland property owners. See <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Lakeman, supra; Scureman </em>v. <em>Judge, supra. </em>Thus, absent clear intent to the contrary, we presume that littoral properties contain fixed landward boundaries. See <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Lakeman, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b428-5\">We turn now to the Nortons\u2019 claim of a deeded interest in the beach. The controlling deed for this analysis is the 1841 deed by which Wilmot conveyed his interest in the beach to his nephews. That deed created a beach parcel separate and distinct from the upland properties of Paqua and Pohogonot, bounding the beach as it had not been previously bounded, and without reference to any prior deed or conveyance.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> All subsequent conveyances of the beach parcel derive from this separation of the beach from the upland properties. The 1841 deed describes the beach as \u201cbounded on the [n]orth by the arable land of Paqua and Pohogonot and by the several ponds in the vicinity; on the [s]outh by the Ocean; and extending to Jobs Neck Point on the [e]ast, and to the Oyster [P]ond opening on the [w]est.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The Nortons contend that the northern boundaries of \u201cthe arable land of Paqua and Pohogonot\u201d and \u201cthe ponds\u201d are natural, moveable features, not fixed boundaries, and therefore the grantor created a moveable parcel that would shift northward with the northerly migration of the arable land and ponds.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b428-6\">\u201cThe basic principle governing the interpretation of deeds is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>that their meaning, derived from the presumed intent of the grantor, is to be ascertained from the words used in the written instrument, construed when necessary in the light of the attendant circumstances.\u201d <em>Patterson </em>v. <em>Paul, </em>448 Mass. 658, 665 (2007), quoting <em>Sheftel </em>v. <em>Lebel, </em>44 Mass. App. Ct. 175, 179 (1998). \u201cWhenever, in the description of land conveyed by deed, known monuments are referred to as boundaries, they must govern.\u201d <em>Burke </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>283 Mass. 63, 67 (1933). \u201c[N]atural or permanent objects, such as streams or rivers and the shore of the sea, or highways or other lands, or artificial land marks or signs such as fences, walls, a line, a building, or a stake and stones, are to be treated as monuments or boundaries.\u201d <em>Temple </em>v. <em>Benson, </em>213 Mass. 128, 132 (1912), and cases cited. That a natural monument may be ambulatory or impermanent does not negate its use as a boundary. See, e.g., <em>Marvel </em>v. <em>Regie-nus, </em>329 Mass. 414, 418 (1952) (use of \u201ccleared land\u201d as natural monument established property boundary despite movement of line marking \u201ccleared land\u201d). When such a monument is used as a boundary, the boundary \u201cmust be taken to refer to the condition of the land at the time the deed was given.\u201d <em>Id., </em>citing <em>Coogan </em>v. <em>Burling Mills, </em>124 Mass. 390, 394 (1878).</p>\n<p id=\"b429-5\">The northern boundary of the beach contained in the 1841 deed is described as \u201cthe arable land of Paqua and Pohogonot and... the several ponds in the vicinity.\u201d No language in the deed states expressly that the interest is moveable. That the deed uses transitory natural monuments, i.e. \u201carable land\u201d and \u201cponds,\u201d to describe the landward boundary does not itself create a transitory landward boundary. See <em>Marvel </em>v. <em>Regienus, supra. </em>The Nortons offer little beyond speculation as to the intent of the grantor, Wilmot, suggesting only that he could have used more \u201cappropriate language\u201d if he had intended to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>create a fixed landward boundary. Speculation as to the grantor\u2019s intent does not suffice to overcome the presumption that the littoral property contained a fixed landward boundary. See <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Lakeman, </em>15 Pick. 151, 153 (1833). Cf. <em>Marvel </em>v. <em>Regienus, supra. </em>Such speculation is in any event undermined by Wil-mot\u2019s roughly contemporaneous use of comparable natural monuments as fixed boundaries. By way of example, in a deed from Wilmot to Samuel dated July 12, 1836, Wilmot describes a lot of land as bounded \u201con all other parts by the cleared land.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b430-5\">This conclusion is buttressed by certain \u201cattendant circumstances,\u201d <em>Patterson </em>v. <em>Paul, supra, </em>i.e., the contemporaneous creation of the Paqua and Pohogonot parcels, which appear to establish a fixed northern boundary for the beach. In addition to creating the beach parcel, the 1841 deed created a separate parcel for the upland Paqua property, describing it as bounded on the north by a fence, to the east and west by ponds, \u201con the [sjouth by the [bjeach,\u201d and as \u201ccontaining about forty[-]five acres.\u201d Given the other fixed boundaries, and that Paqua is said to total forty-five acres, its fixed southern boundary, where the landward boundary of the beach was located at the time of the conveyance, can be determined.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-6\">Additionally, the sequentially recorded and separate deed by which Samuel\u2019s eight heirs conveyed the Pohogonot parcel to Wilmot described Pohogonot as bounded on the south by the \u201cfence or [bjeach.\u201d This description indicates that, at the time of the 1841 deed, a fence ran along the boundary of the arable land between the beach and the ponds named in the deed. Because the location of this boundary can be ascertained by virtue of an 1846 coastal survey, which located a fence separating Pohogonot from the beach as described in the 1841 deed, the beach\u2019s northern boundary, as it then existed, can also be derived by means of the fence. See <em>Marvel </em>v. <em>Regienus, supra. </em>See also <em>McGeechan </em>v. <em>Sherwood, </em>760 A.2d 1068, 1075 (Me. 2000), quoting <em>Theri-ault </em>v. <em>Murray, </em>588 A.2d 720, 722 (Me. 1991) (\u201cThe physical disappearance of a monument does not end its use in defining a boundary if its former location can be ascertained\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b430-7\">Moreover, there is nothing in the deed conveying Pohogonot to Wilmot to suggest that Pohogonot was to be subject to continuing diminution by a migrating beach parcel which would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>retain its original size, notwithstanding its northward migration, as Pohogonot was gradually subsumed by the beach. It seems unlikely that Wilmot would have conveyed to Samuel\u2019s heirs all of his interest in Paqua and the beach in exchange for an ever-shrinking Pohogonot parcel. Cf. <em>Ryan </em>v. <em>Stavros, </em>348 Mass. 251, 259 (1964) (\u201cIt is proper to consider the improbability that a grantor who conveyed all her adjoining land would seek to retain such a relatively useless strip\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b431-4\">Because there is no language in the 1841 deed expressly stating that the beach parcel created was moveable, nor is there evidence to indicate the grantor intended to convey a moveable interest, the Nortons hold title to a \u201cfixed and stable\u201d beach parcel. See <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Lakeman, supra </em>at 154. Because the boundaries of the parcel as it existed in 1841 are ascertainable, see <em>Marvel </em>v. <em>Regienus, supra, </em>and are in an area that is now completely covered by the Atlantic Ocean, the Nortons have no title interest in any portion of the beach as it is presently located. Therefore, the judge correctly granted summary judgment in favor of the Flynns on the Nortons\u2019 title claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-5\">3. <em>Prescriptive easement claim. </em>The Nortons maintain that, even if they do not have a deeded fractional interest in the beach, they have established a prescriptive easement to use the entire beach, from Oyster Pond on the west to Little Job\u2019s Neck Pond on the east. An easement by prescription is acquired by the (1) continuous and uninterrupted, (2) open and notorious, and (3) adverse use of another\u2019s land (4) for a period of not less than twenty years.

P. 52(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b433-5\">a. <em>Judge\u2019s findings of fact. </em>The judge found the following.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> In the early 1950s, Sonny and Uncle George, \u201cthe patriarchs of their respective families,. . . shared the properties and allowed each other to make use of the other\u2019s.\u201d As the families increased in size, the number of people using the beach increased accordingly. Even given the greater number of people using the beach in the 1960s and 1970s, the beach was so large that one family could \u201cmake use of a portion thereof without disturbing, or even being seen by, members of the other family.\u201d The Nortons tended to use the beach near Little Job\u2019s Neck Pond and Job\u2019s Neck Pond, \u201ckeeping their distance from the Flynn houses and the barrier beach at Oyster Pond.\u201d \u201cIf members of the Norton Family wanted to use the portion of the [bjeach near Oyster Pond, as they did on several occasions, they would contact Uncle George and request permission. It was seldom if ever denied.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b433-6\">While attempting to resolve the conflict involving Friedman\u2019s horseback riding on Flynn property, in 1987 the parties reached an agreement allowing \u201cFriedman and members of the Norton family [to] continue to use the ways in question while the negotiations continued.\u201d Negotiations continued for a number of years. In 1999, however, the Flynns posted a notice to prevent easement pursuant to G. L. c. 187, \u00a7 4. Any use of the beach by the Nortons, Friedman, or their guests and tenants that began in the early 1980s was \u201ccut off\u201d by the posting, resulting in a period of use shorter than the twenty-year period required to establish a prescriptive easement. The judge stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b433-7\">\u201cAccordingly, I need not delve into it much further <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>except to point out that the historical relationship between the Norton and Flynn Families, going back for many years, requires me to conclude that any use of the parcel was <em>permissive, </em>rather than adverse. In addition, there were certain unusual circumstances that precluded the clock from running on any possible claim of prescription. For example,. . . any use by the Nortons of the Road to Short Point was <em>not adverse </em>because the Nortons and Flynns had <em>agreed. </em>. . that the Nortons would still be able to use the property.\u201d (Emphasis in original.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b434-4\">Although the Nortons historically stayed away from the Oyster Pond beach \u201cbecause the Flynns tended to congregate there,\u201d the Nortons had begun going to that area in later years, especially after Friedman purchased his property. There were \u201cseveral occasions\u201d during that period when the Flynns \u201cquestioned the Nortons\u2019 and Friedman\u2019s right to be there and asked them to leave.\u201d The judge concluded that \u201cthe Flynns allowed and permitted the Nortons and their friends to use the Beach and ways at issue in this case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b434-5\">b. <em>Elements of a prescriptive easement found unsupported. </em>We examine in turn each of the three elements of a prescriptive easement which the judge found unsupported.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-6\">i. <em>Open and notorious. </em>\u201cTo be \u2018open,\u2019 the use must be without attempted concealment\u201d; to be notorious, the use must put the landowner on constructive notice of the adverse use. See <em>Booth-royd </em>v. <em>Bogartz, </em>68 Mass. App. Ct. 40, 44 (2007). The judge made two subsidiary findings of fact pertaining to this element. He found that the length of the beach is such that individuals standing on opposite ends of it could not see each other; and the Nortons, at least prior to the 1980\u2019s, avoided the Oyster Pond beach area where the Flynns historically congregated.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b434-7\">The Nortons maintain that the Flynns had actual knowledge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>of their use of the beach during the relevant periods and thus that their use was by definition open and notorious. Testimony of members of the Flynn family is replete with acknowledgments of the Nortons\u2019 use of the beach. The Flynns\u2019 theory at trial was largely that the Nortons used the beach only with their permission, necessarily implying that the Flynns had actual knowledge of the Nortons\u2019 use. Because the requirement of open and notorious use \u201cis intended only to secure to the owner a fair chance of protecting himself,\u201d <em>Foot </em>v. <em>Bauman, </em>333 Mass. 214, 218 (1955), a property owner\u2019s actual knowledge of a claimant\u2019s adverse use of the property satisfies this element.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-5\">The judge made no findings as to the Flynns\u2019 numerous acknowledgments of the Nortons\u2019 use of the beach. Without such subsidiary findings, we cannot review adequately the basis for the judge\u2019s determination that the Nortons\u2019 use was neither open nor notorious during the relevant periods. See <em>Trenz </em>v. <em>Norwell, </em>68 Mass. App. Ct. 271, 277-278 (2007) (judge\u2019s bare ultimate conclusions insufficient where judge did not mention contrary evidence that \u201cwas extensive and for the most part uncontradicted\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b435-6\">ii. <em>Twenty-year period. </em>To establish a prescriptive easement, the adverse use must be continuous and uninterrupted for a twenty-year period. <em>Ryan </em>v. <em>Stavros, </em>348 Mass. 252, 253 (1964), citing <em>Nocera </em>v. <em>DeFeo, </em>340 Mass. 783, 783 (1959). The judge found that any twenty-year period of use must have concluded prior to 1999, when the Flynns effectively cut off any adverse use of the beach by posting the notice concerning G. L. c. 187, \u00a7 <em>4.</em><footnotemark><em>22</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Although this finding addresses any prescriptive easement claim that is premised on use beginning after 1979, it does not address the Nortons\u2019 claim that they had been using the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>beach under a claim of right since 1938, sixty-one years prior to the effective cutoff date. Therefore, we cannot adequately review the judge\u2019s finding that no twenty-year period during this sixty-one-year span was sufficient to establish a prescriptive easement.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-5\">iii. <em>Adverse use. </em>To be adverse, the use must be made under a claim of right. See <em>Gower </em>v. <em>Saugus, </em>315 Mass. 677, 681-682 (1944), citing <em>Sprow </em>v. <em>Boston Albany R.R., </em>163 Mass. 330, 339 (1895). The judge determined that the Nortons\u2019 use of the beach was permissive. The Nortons maintain that the judge\u2019s finding ignored clear evidence in the record showing that the Nortons used the beach under the belief that they owned it and that the Flynns similarly believed the Nortons used the beach pursuant to a fractional ownership interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-6\">The evidence on the issue of permission was both considerable and contradictory. The judge found that the Nortons asked permission to use the beach at Oyster Pond, but provided no subsidiary findings in support of this determination despite unvarying testimony of members of the Norton family that they would not seek permission to use the beach because they believed they had an ownership interest in it.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> The judge also found that the Flynns granted the Nortons permission to use the beach but again provided no subsidiary findings in support of this determination despite testimony and evidence that at least some Flynn family members believed that the Nortons used the beach pursuant to a fractional ownership interest.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> While there is evidence that supports the judge\u2019s finding as to permissive use, there is also clear and voluminous evidence to the contrary.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> In such circumstances, a bare conclusion without subsidiary find<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>ings does not allow for adequate appellate review. See <em>Rapp </em>v. <em>Berry, </em>398 Mass. 1004, 1005 (1986), quoting <em>Equal Employment Opportunity Comm\u2019n </em>v. <em>United Virginia Bank/Seaboard Nat\u2019l, </em>555 F.2d 403, 406 (4th Cir. 1977) (\u201cWhere evidence is conflicting, ultimate conclusions are insufficient because they lack \u2018detail and exactness\u2019 \u201d); <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>Burke, </em>69 Mass. App. Ct. 77, 79 (2007) (where \u201cfacts were disputed and the testimony was conflicting,\u201d judge\u2019s \u201csparse findings [were] insufficient\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b437-5\">The judge\u2019s findings also do not address the full extent of the Nortons\u2019 prescriptive easement claim. The judge found that the Nortons asked permission to use the beach at Oyster Pond and that the Flynns began to question the Nortons\u2019 right to be on the beach after Friedman\u2019s arrival in the early 1980s. The Nortons\u2019 claim, however, encompasses the entire beach, not just Oyster Pond, and is based on adverse use starting in 1938, decades before Friedman purchased any property.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> The trial decision lacks any subsidiary findings as to whether the Nortons\u2019 use of other portions of the beach prior to Friedman\u2019s arrival was permissive or adverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-6\">c. <em>Sufficiency of the findings of fact. </em>Rule 52 (a) of the Massachusetts Rules of Civil Procedure requires that \u201cin all actions tried upon the facts without a jury, the court shall find the facts specially and state separately its conclusions of law thereon.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>The rule \u201cserves to (1) insure the quality of a judge\u2019s decision making process by requiring simultaneous articulation of the judge\u2019s underlying reasoning; (2) assure the parties that their claims have been fully and fairly considered; and (3) inform an appellate court of the basis on which a decision has been reached.\u201d <em>Cormier </em>v. <em>Carty, </em>381 Mass. 234, 236 (1980). The rule \u201cimpose[s] on the judge an independent duty to articulate the essential grounds of his decision.\u201d <em>Schrottman </em>v. <em>Barnicle, </em>386 Mass. 627, 638 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b438-4\">For the reasons discussed, the record does not contain such subsidiary findings of fact as are necessary to permit adequate review of the judge\u2019s conclusion that the Nortons\u2019 use of the beach was not open and notorious, adverse, or for a period of twenty years. It may well be the case that the judge credited some witnesses\u2019 testimony, in whole or part, and did not credit that of others, in whole or part, particularly where issues involved extensive contradictory testimony. See <em>Matsushita Elec. Corp. of Am. </em>v. <em>Sonus Corp., </em>362 Mass. 246, 254 (1972). However, because the decision is generally silent as to such matters, the meager findings do not permit us to infer the credibility determinations the judge may have made.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-5\">We take no view on whether the evidence produced at trial is sufficient to support the conclusion that the Nortons did not establish a prescriptive easement; we simply require additional findings of fact, based on this evidence, so as to permit an adequate review. See Mass. R. Civ. R 52 (a). Because the findings do not provide us with a \u201cclear understanding of the judge\u2019s reasoning and the basis of his decision,\u201d <em>Rapp </em>v. <em>Berry, supra </em>at 1005, we remand for further findings of fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-6\">4. <em>Statute of limitations. </em>The trustees of the Pohogonot Trust (Pohogonot trustees), who were the holders of the remainder interests in the Flynn property under the will of Elizabeth D. Flynn and were, at the time of trial, title holders to the majority of the beach, see note 10, <em>supra, </em>moved for partial summary judgment based on a defense specific to their former status as remaindermen. Their motion rests on the claim that any twenty-year period of adverse use by the Nortons could not have begun to run against them, as remaindermen, until July of 1979. Any such use, they argue, was effectively cut off in June of 1999 by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>their posting of the notice to prevent easement, one month shy of the required twenty-year period. They assert that the denial of their motion for partial summary judgment was error.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-5\">General Laws c. 260, \u00a7 21, which governs actions to prevent the establishment of prescriptive rights, provides that \u201c[a]n action for the recovery of land shall be commenced, or an entry made thereon, only within twenty years after the right of action or of entry <em>first accrued, </em>or within twenty years after the deman-dant or the person making the entry, or those under whom they claim, have been seized or possessed of the premises. . . .\u201d (Emphasis supplied.) Until 1979, the right of entry or of an action to recover land, challenging the adverse use of property, did not accrue as to remaindermen until the intermediate estate expired. G. L. c. 260, \u00a7 23, repealed by St. 1979, c. 402, \u00a7 3.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> In other words, remaindermen, such as the Pohogonot trustees, could not challenge any adverse use of the property in which they held a future interest during the term of the intermediate estate. By the same token, neither could any adverse user establish prescriptive rights against the remaindermen.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-6\">However, this statute was repealed in July, 1979, thereby permitting holders of remainder interests to bring actions challenging adverse use during the term of the intermediate estate, as well as permitting adverse users to establish prescriptive rights against remaindermen. Thus, July of 1979 was the first time that the Pohogonot trustees could have taken any action against the Nortons\u2019 purported adverse use of the beach. They did not do so, however, until June, 1999. They maintained that they need not have acted sooner because the statutory twenty-year period necessary to establish prescriptive rights could only have begun in July of 1979.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>The question is thus whether the repeal of G. L. c. 260, \u00a7 23, applies retroactively, i.e., whether the Nortons\u2019 twenty-year period of adverse use of the beach could have begun prior to July, 1979, such that the Pohogonot trustees would have had to have taken action prior to July, 1999, in order to terminate that adverse use. Generally, the presumption is that \u201call statutes are prospective in their operation, unless an intention that they shall be retrospective appears by necessary implication from their words, context or objects when considered in the light of the subject matter, the pre-existing state of the law and the effect upon existent rights, remedies and obligations.\u201d <em>Hanscom </em>v. <em>Malden &amp; Melrose Gas Light Co., </em>220 Mass. 1, 3 (1914). \u201cIt is only statutes regulating practice, procedure and evidence, in short, those relating to remedies and not affecting substantive rights, that commonly are treated as operating retrospectively, and as applying to pending actions or causes of action.\u201d <em>Id., </em>and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-5\">General Laws c. 260, \u00a7 23, by its plain language, modified the statute of limitations, G. L. c. 260, \u00a7 21, by virtue of demarcating when the statutory twenty-year period accrues for holders of future interests.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> Its repeal thus likewise modified the statute of limitations. Because we treat statutes of limitations as procedural, <em>Cosme </em>v. <em>Whitlin Mach. Works, Inc., </em>417 Mass. 643, 645-646 (1994), \u201c[t]he general rule is that if a statute of limitations does not contain language clearly limiting its application to causes of action arising in the future, then it controls future procedure in reference to previously existing causes of action.\u201d <em>Anderson </em>v. <em>Phoenix, </em>387 Mass. 444, 453-454 (1982), citing <em>Mulvey </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>197 Mass. 178, 181 (1908). In light of this principle, the repeal of G. L. c. 260, \u00a7 23, applies retroactively, and the Nortons\u2019 prescriptive easement claim is not limited to adverse use beginning after July, 1979.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>Accordingly, the Pohogonot trustees\u2019 motion for partial summary judgment was properly denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-5\">5. <em>Conclusion. </em>So much of the judgment as declares that the plaintiffs do not hold title to the beach is affirmed. So much of the judgment as declares that the plaintiffs have not established a prescriptive easement to use the beach is vacated. The matter is remanded to the Land Court for further proceedings, as necessary, and for findings of fact, consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b442-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>[[Image here]]</p>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b419-14\">The parties are not all members of these two families, but all title interests in the property are derived from title historically held by the respective families.

A Land Court judge allowed the plaintiffs\u2019 motion for a preliminary injunction enjoining certain defendants from interfering with the plaintiffs\u2019 use of asserted rights of way over the Flynn property to access the beach. In April, 2005, the judge allowed the trustees of the Pohogonot Trust, a trustee of the Job\u2019s Neck Trust, and a trustee of the High Road Trust to intervene as defendants.

The Nortons, however, acknowledge that, at the time of the 1712 conveyance, Captain Smith \u201calso owned the farmland known as Paqua and Pohogonot, which lies north of the Beach on the west and east side of Paqua Pond respectively.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b422-8\">In 1875, the heirs of Josiah H. Smith, who was one of Samuel\u2019s eight heirs, conveyed their fractional interest in the beach and Paqua to Nathaniel Luce. Allen Norton, great-grandfather of the plaintiff Allen W. Norton, then obtained one-half of this interest in a conveyance from Nathaniel Luce, one-quarter of the interest in inheritance from Susan Luce, and the remaining one-quarter in a conveyance from William H. Vincent and Elisa I. Vincent. In 1951, Eliza B. Norton, then the holder of the Norton deeded beach interest, died and conveyed the residue of her real estate interests to her son Winthrop B. Norton (Sonny). In 1981, Sonny died and devised one-half of the deeded <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>beach interest to his daughter, Wilda J.

Flynn acquired a fractional interest in the beach, as well as interests in Paqua and Pohogonot, through conveyances from Love P. Smith and Ellen Mayhew, granddaughters of Samuel Smith. George D. Flynn died on November 19, 1926, and his entire estate, including the property at issue, passed to his widow, Elizabeth D. Flynn. Elizabeth D. Flynn died on October 19, 1951, and by her will left all of her real estate on Martha\u2019s Vineyard to her children for life, with a remainder to her grandchildren. On September 13, 1974, the grandchildren of Elizabeth D. Flynn (Dorothy F. Keeler, Judith F. Fuller, Harry F. Flynn, Thomas L. Flynn, Jr., Patricia L. Coward, Florence L. Peters, John W.

By deed dated March 8, 2000, the trustees of the Pohogonot Tmst conveyed to Pamela Kohl-berg, trastee of the Job\u2019s Neck Trust, a parcel of land south of Little Job\u2019s Neck Pond, bounded southerly by the Atlantic Ocean.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b423-8\">A decision sketch of the property created by the Land Court is reproduced in the Appendix.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b424-7\">The beach currently appears to be located on the former uplands of Paqua, Pohogonot, Isaac\u2019s Neck, and Short Point. Paqua and Pohogonot belong to the Flynns. Their title interest in Paqua derives from conveyances from Samuel\u2019s heirs Love P. Smith and Ellen B. Mayhew. Their interest in Pohogonot derives from Tarsha\u2019s son Wilmot, by way of conveyances to Gilbert W. Smith and Chauncey Crane. Their interest in Isaac\u2019s Neck derives from Samuel Smith, who acquired such title from his sisters.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-8\">The Nortons previously held title to the upland property on the eastern end of the beach known as Short Point. In 1958, Sonny conveyed this property to George D. Flynn (Uncle George). Thus, at the time of trial, the Nortons had no title interest in the formerly upland property on which the beach is presently located. We offer no view as to any interest the Commonwealth may arguably have in the portions of the beach that have migrated into the beds of the upland coastal ponds. See <em>Attorney General </em>v. <em>Jamaica Pond Aqueduct Corp., </em>133 Mass. 361, 364 (1882) (\u201cThe great ponds of the Commonwealth belong to the public, and, like the tide waters and navigable streams, are under the control and care of the Commonwealth\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b425-8\">\u201cAccretion\u201d is defined as \u201c[t]he gradual accumulation of land by natural forces, esp. as alluvium is added to land situated on the bank of a river or on the seashore.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 23 (9th ed. 2009). \u201cErosion\u201d is defined as \u201c[t]he wearing away of something by actions of the elements; esp., the gradual eating away of soil by the operation of currents or tides.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 621.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b426-7\">The Nortons rely on <em>Anderson </em>v. <em>Devries, </em>326 Mass. 127, 130, 133-134 (1950), overruled on other grounds by <em>M.P.M. Builders, LLC </em>v. <em>Dwyer, </em>442 Mass. 87 (2004), and <em>Phillips </em>v. <em>Rhodes, 7 </em>Met. 322, 325 (1843), cases involving easements appurtenant to beaches which were held to move as the beach shifted. The easements in those cases, however, were granted explicitly to enable particular uses of the shoreline, such as swimming, bathing, and harvesting seaweed, and thus of necessity shifted with the movement of the shore. By contrast, here we are concerned with a claimed fee interest, implicating quite different considerations. Moreover, the Nortons do not suggest that there was any comparable shoreline-specific purpose in the 1841 deed to the beach.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-8\">The Nortons also place considerable reliance on <em>Scratton </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>107 Eng. Rep. 1140 (K.B. 1825), where the court held that a conveyance of \u201csea-grounds, oyster layings, shores, and fisheries, extended from the south at low-water mark, to the north at high-water mark,\u201d shifted with changes in such marks. <em>Id. </em>at 1140. That case is distinguishable due to the unique legal significance of the Crown\u2019s inherent ownership of the land between the high and low water marks, which was considered to exist wherever such marks might be located over time, i.e., a moveable parcel. <em>Id. </em>at 1145-1146. Thus, where the Crown conveyed such property, it conveyed a moveable parcel. <em>Id. </em>Although we have cited in dicta to <em>Scratton </em>v. <em>Brown, supra, </em>in a case not involving littoral property, <em>Percival </em>v. <em>Chase, </em>182 Mass. 371, 378 (1903), we have not expressly adopted its reasoning.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b428-7\">The Nortons emphasize the 1712 deed from Captain Butler to Captain Smith, which conveys the beach as a separate parcel without describing a northern boundary. See part l.b, <em>supra. </em>That deed, however, refers explicitly to the 1693 conveyance to Captain Butler, where the beach was described as bounded on the north by \u201cthe pond, or ponds.\u201d While the 1841 deed was not the first to describe separately a \u201cbeach,\u201d it was the first to describe the beach as a parcel distinct from other parcels, without reference to prior deeds or descriptions. The 1841 deed thereby created a unique beach parcel superseding any prior descriptions of the beach.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b428-8\">The Nortons claim a title interest only in the portions of the beach presently located on upland properties that were formerly owned in common with the beach, namely Paqua and Pohogonot.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b428-9\">As the Nortons point out, conveyances subsequent to the 1841 deed describe the beach without mention of a northern or southern boundary. These conveyances, however, derive from the 1841 deed and use the term \u201cbeach\u201d in reference to the beach described therein. Because the 1841 deed divided the beach parcel from the uplands, which were also then divided among the Smith family, subsequent conveyances could not convey a beach that shifted onto those uplands unless the grantor or grantors held title to the uplands and thus <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>had the right to diminish the upland property. Such was not the case in any post-1841 conveyances in the Nortons\u2019 chain of tide.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-7\">For this reason, we are not persuaded by the Nortons\u2019 argument, based on an 1875 deed, in which the heirs of Josiah H. Smith conveyed to Nathaniel Luce \u201call our right and interest in the beach extending from Job\u2019s Neck Point to Matcha Line, so called, however the above may be located.\u201d Even if we construed this language as creating a moveable beach parcel, the grantors did not hold title to the uplands on which the beach would move, and therefore could not have conveyed a parcel that would encroach on such property.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b431-7\">Although the Nortons claim to have used the beach well before 1938, they note this date as the starting point for their claimed period of adverse use. They do so because the trial judge determined that the Nortons\u2019 deeded beach interest became completely submerged by the Atlantic Ocean no later than 1938. Thus, their use of the beach thereafter would have been adverse.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b432-7\">The Nortons contend also that the judge erred by not shifting the burden of proof to the Flynns to establish that the use was permissive, as required upon a plaintiff\u2019s showing of uninterrupted, continuous, open, and notorious use of the land for a period of twenty years. See <em>Daley </em>v. <em>Swampscott, </em>11 Mass. App. Ct. 822, 827 (1981), citing <em>Truc </em>v. <em>Field, </em>269 Mass. 524, 528-529 (1930). Insofar as the judge determined that the Nortons\u2019 use of the land was \u201cneither adverse nor open and notorious nor\u201d for a period of twenty years, this burden shifting was not warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-8\">The Nortons maintain that the judge erred by importing an \u201cunwarranted requirement of personal hostility into the prescription doctrine.\u201d Although the Nortons are correct that personal hostility is not necessary to establish a prescriptive easement, the nature of the relationship between the claimant and the property owner may be considered in determining whether the use of the property was adverse. See <em>Totman </em>v. <em>Malloy, </em>431 Mass. 143, 145 (2000) (\u201cWhether a use is nonpermissive depends on many circumstances, including... the nature of the individual relationship between the parties claiming ownership\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b433-8\">The judge\u2019s decision contains a section entitled \u201cFindings of Fact,\u201d which includes twenty findings, none directly addressing the Nortons\u2019 claim of a prescriptive easement. The twenty findings are essentially identical to the undisputed facts which the judge recited in his decision on the cross motions for summary judgment on the Nortons\u2019 claim of title. Although the findings are pertinent to the issues of title and beach erosion, they do not specifically address the elements of prescriptive easement. Other portions of the decision set forth certain additional findings.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b434-8\">Relying on <em>Gadreault </em>v. <em>Hillman, </em>317 Mass. 656, 663 (1945), the judge ruled, \u201cWhere, as here, the land over which the easement is claimed is large, unenclosed, and in its natural state, the party claiming the easement faces an increased burden to show that the use was sufficiently notorious to permit an inference of knowledge and implied acquiescence on the part of the owner.\u201d However, where \u201cthe only type of use for which the land in question is suited is for \u2018the usual beach and bathing purposes\u2019 ... the plaintiffs\u2019 claim cannot <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>be defeated on the ground that the land is \u2018undeveloped [and] wild.\u2019 \u201d <em>La-bounty </em>v. <em>Vickers, </em>352 Mass. 337,348-349 (1967). Application of this heightened burden to beaches on the basis that the land is \u201cundeveloped and wild\u201d must accordingly be premised on a factual finding that the property was suited for uses other than the \u201cusual beach and bathing purposes.\u201d Because the judge made no such finding, we cannot ascertain whether the imposition of a heightened burden was error.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b435-8\">The judge found also that \u201cunusual circumstances . . . precluded the clock from running on any possible claim of prescription,\u201d but these circumstances appear to refer to agreements between the Nortons and the Flynns as to use of beach access paths, not use of the beach itself.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"23\">\n<p id=\"b436-7\">Allen Norton testified that he would ask permission to go on the Flynns\u2019 property but not the beach because he \u201calready ownfed] an interest in the beach.\u201d The Nortons\u2019 testimony concerning permission showed that, at least prior to the commencement of the negotiations over the beach rights, they would seek permission to use specific parcels of Flynn upland property, or more generally to use Flynn \u201cproperty,\u201d but not specifically to use the beach.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"24\">\n<p id=\"b436-8\">John Flynn testified that his father and Uncle George told him that the Nortons used the beach because they owned a \u201cfractional interest in the beach,\u201d which he believed to be the case until the early 1980s. A letter written by Uncle George to John Flynn in 1982 stated, \u201cSonny always said \u2018I own a 5th of the beach.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"25\">\n<p id=\"b436-9\">There was evidence that, in 1950, Sonny and Uncle George hired attorney Harry Perlstein to prepare an opinion (Perlstein opinion) as to record owner<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>ship of the beach. Perlstein concluded that the Flynns owned three-fifths of the beach and that the Nortons owned one-fifth. Following Sonny\u2019s death in 1981, when some members of the Flynn family raised questions about the Nortons\u2019 sale of fractional interests in the beach and rights of way to the beach, the Nortons referenced the Perlstein opinion, and the questions ceased.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-9\">The judge made no findings concerning the Perlstein opinion, other than to note that the opinion relates to the beach as it existed in 1841, now submerged beneath the ocean. The opinion remains relevant, however, to the prescriptive easement claim, if it demonstrates that the Flynns knew the Nortons used the beach under a claim of right. Indeed, Uncle George\u2019s letter to John Flynn in 1982, see note 24, <em>supra, </em>appears to say as much. Additionally, in his decision granting summary judgment on the title claim, the judge noted that \u201cthe fact that the Flynn[s] acted consistent with [the Perlstein opinion] after its delivery demonstrates that the Flynn[s] believed [it] was accurate.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"26\">\n<p id=\"b437-11\">Notably, the judge found that \u201cthe Norton family, for a long time, generally stayed away from Oyster Pond Beach.\u201d The judge\u2019s findings do not address areas of the beach other than Oyster Pond, where the Nortons\u2019 claim arguably would be stronger.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"27\">\n<p id=\"b439-7\">The repealed statute provided, in relevant part,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b439-8\">\u201cIn the construction of sections twenty-one to thirty-one, inclusive [of c. 260], the right of entry or of action to recover land shall be held to have <em>first accrued </em>at the times, respectively, hereinafter mentioned: . . .
