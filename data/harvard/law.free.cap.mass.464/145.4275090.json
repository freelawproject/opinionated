Marino, such that his estate may now be sued by the plaintiff, Kraft Power Corporation (Kraft).</p>\n<p id=\"b164-7\">Because the doctrine of corporate disregard is not a cause of action but an equitable doctrine by which an act or obligation of a corporation giving rise to a cause of action may be charged to a principal of the corporation, we look to the underlying claims to decide whether a cause of action survives.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We conclude that Kraft\u2019s claims for breach of contract; for remedies under the Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act, G. L. c. 109A (UFTA); and for violations of G. L. c. 93A should not have been dismissed, because all three claims are contractual in nature. Since fraud is a tort not enumerated in G. L. c. 228, \u00a7 1, Kraft\u2019s fraud claim does not survive Marino\u2019s death, and properly was dismissed. Because Kraft\u2019s unjust enrichment claim is premised on the allegation that Sharon F. Merrill, as executrix of Marino\u2019s estate (estate), is currently retaining funds that belong to Kraft, neither the doctrine of corporate disregard nor the doctrine of survival have any application; this claim should not have been dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-8\"><em>Background and prior proceedings. </em>Marino was the sole shareholder, sole director, president, and treasurer of Power Wiring &amp; Emergency Response Inc. (Power Wiring). Kraft sold equipment to Power Wiring, which failed to pay Kraft. Kraft eventually obtained a default judgment against Power Wiring for breach of contract, in the amount of $259,417.47, but was unable to enforce the judgment because Power Wiring had no assets. Marino died before entry of the default judgment, and Kraft brought an action in the Superior Court against Merrill, as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>executrix of the estate; Merrill in her individual capacity; and Integrated Systems &amp; Service, LLC (Integrated).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Kraft\u2019s complaint in essence alleges that Marino was responsible for the contractual obligations of Power Wiring because he abused the corporate form in that he caused Power Wiring, a corporation over which he exercised pervasive control, to become insolvent by transferring all of its assets to Integrated, another corporation owned and controlled by Marino; used Power Wiring and Integrated as sham corporations for his personal benefit; and used Integrated to deny Kraft the means to enforce its judgment against Power Wiring. Kraft\u2019s complaint asserts claims against the estate based on breach of contract, the UFTA, violations of G. L. c. 93A, unjust enrichment, and fraud.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-5\">The defendants filed a joint motion for judgment on the pleadings, raising only the narrow issue whether the claims against the estate must be dismissed because they do not survive Mari-no\u2019s death. The defendants argued that none of the claims survived, as each claim arises from fraudulent acts or misrepresentations made by Marino. Concluding that the doctrine of corporate disregard did not transform the underlying actions into contract actions, and that the doctrine could not be extended \u201cto establish survivability of a claim that would otherwise be extinguished upon the death of a party,\u201d a Superior Court judge dismissed all claims against the estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-6\">A separate and final judgment, pursuant to Mass. R. Civ. P. 54 (b), 365 Mass. 820 (1974), issued as to Kraft\u2019s claims against the estate, thus permitting Kraft\u2019s appeal to go forward. After Kraft\u2019s appeal was entered in the Appeals Court, we transferred the case on our own motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-7\"><em>Discussion. </em>We review the allowance of a motion for judgment on the pleadings de novo, based on our review of the allegations in the complaint. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fremont Inv. &amp; Loan, </em>459 Mass. 209, 212 (2011); <em>Wheatley </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Insurers Insolvency Fund, </em>456 Mass. 594, 600-601 (2010). We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>begin by examining the nature of the doctrine of corporate disregard and its relationship to an underlying cause of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-5\">1. <em>Piercing the corporate veil. </em>It is a general principle of corporate law \u201cdeeply \u2018ingrained in our economic and legal systems\u2019 that a parent corporation ... is not liable for the acts of its subsidiaries.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Bestfoods, </em>524 U.S. 51, 61 (1998), quoting Douglas &amp; Shanks, Insulation from Liability Through Subsidiary Corporations, 39 Yale LJ. 193, 193 (1929). See <em>My Bread Baking Co. </em>v. <em>Cumberland Farms, Inc., </em>353 Mass. 614, 618 (1968), quoting Douglas &amp; Shanks, <em>supra. </em>This general rule, which also applies to defeat claims against corporate principals for a corporation\u2019s acts, gives way when circumstances arise that provide an \u201coccasion \u2018to look beyond the corporate form for the purpose of defeating fraud or wrong, or for the remedying of injuries.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id., </em>quoting <em>M. McDonough Corp. </em>v. <em>Connolly, </em>313 Mass. 62, 65-66 (1943). See <em>Scott </em>v. <em>NG US 1, Inc., </em>450 Mass. 760, 766-767 (2008), citing <em>Hanson </em>v. <em>Bradley, </em>298 Mass. 371, 381 (1937) (equitable doctrine of corporate disregard exercised \u201conly for the defeat of fraud or wrong, or the remedying of injustice\u201d). In such circumstances, the corporate veil can be pierced, as a tool of equity, to disregard the corporation\u2019s existence and impose liability on individual principals. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Bestfoods, supra </em>at 64.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-26\">Here, we consider whether a cause of action survives the death of the alleged wrongdoer, a corporate principal, when the plaintiff attempts to bring a cause of action against the corporate principal by piercing the corporate veil. Once the corporate veil is pierced, the individual defendant and the corporation become \u201cone for all purposes.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Lehigh Valley R.R., </em>220 U.S. 257, 272 (1911). We therefore conclude that the analysis is no different when a cause of action is premised on piercing the corporate veil than when it has been brought directly against an alleged wrongdoer. This is because the doctrine is not itself a cause of action but \u201can equitable tool that authorizes courts, in rare situations, to ignore corporate formalities, where such disregard is necessary to provide a meaningful remedy for injuries and to avoid injustice.\u201d <em>Attorney Gen. </em>v. <em>M.C.K., Inc., </em>432 Mass. 546, 555 (2000), citing <em>My Bread Baking Co. </em>v. <em>Cumberland Farms, Inc., supra </em>at 620.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>Litigants attempt to pierce a corporate veil as a \u201cmeans of imposing liability on an underlying cause of action such as a tort or breach of contract.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> 61 W.M. Fletcher, Fletcher Cyclopedia of the Law of Corporations \u00a7 41.10 (rev. ed. 2006). See <em>Peacock </em>v. <em>Thomas, </em>516 U.S. 349, 354 (1996), quoting 1 C. Keating &amp; G. O\u2019Gradney, Fletcher Cyclopedia of the Law of Private Corporations \u00a7 41, at 603 (perm. ed. 1990) (piercing corporate veil is not itself independent ERISA cause of action \u201cbut rather is a means of imposing liability on an underlying cause of action\u201d). Therefore, to determine whether a cause of action survives the death of a party, courts must look beneath the corporate veil to the underlying substantive claim for which a plaintiff seeks to impose a corporation\u2019s liability on an individual shareholder.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b167-5\">2. <em>Survival of actions. </em>We turn next to a discussion of the Massachusetts survival statute, G. L. c. 228, \u00a7 l,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> which provides <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>for the survival of enumerated tort actions, \u201c[i]n addition to the actions which survive by the common law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b168-5\">At common law, actions based on contract survived the death of a party. See <em>Gasior </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Gen. Hosp., </em>446 Mass. 645, 649 (2006); <em>Rendek </em>v. <em>Sheriff of Bristol County, </em>440 Mass. 1017, 1017 (2003); <em>McStowe </em>v. <em>Bornstein, </em>377 Mass. 804, 806-807 (1979). By contrast, tort actions did not survive. See <em>Pine </em>v. <em>Rust, </em>404 Mass. 411, 417 (1989), citing <em>Putnam </em>v. <em>Savage, </em>244 Mass. 83, 85 (1923).* ******<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The Legislature enacted the survival statute \u201cto abrogate the common law rule established in Massachusetts that tort actions were personal and, thus, did not survive the death of either the injured party or the wrongdoer.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <em>Sheldone </em>v. <em>Marino, </em>398 Mass. 817, 818 (1986). Subsequently, a cause of action survives if it falls within the list of torts enumerated in G. L. c. 228, \u00a7 1, or if it is \u201cdeemed an action that survives \u2018by the common law.\u2019 \u201d <em>Gasior </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Gen. Hosp., supra </em>at 649, citing G. L. c. 228, \u00a7 1. See <em>Rendek </em>v. <em>Sheriff of Bristol County, supra </em>at 1017 (to survive death of party, claim not enumerated in G. L. c. 228, \u00a7 1, \u201cmust be deemed a cause of action that survives by common law\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b168-6\">When assessing whether a claim is contractual or tortious in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>nature to determine if it survives under common law, \u201c[w]e have looked with disfavor on rigid procedural distinctions between contract and tort and are more concerned today with substance than with form.\u201d <em>McStowe </em>v. <em>Bornstein, supra </em>at 808. For example, we held in <em>Gasior </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Gen. Hosp., supra </em>at 650-651, that an employee\u2019s claim for wrongful termination under G. L. c. 15IB, \u00a7 4 (16), survived his death because his claim was, in substance, a claim that his employer committed a breach of an implied contractual term of the at-will employment relationship.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b169-5\">3. <em>Whether the plaintiff\u2019s claims survive. </em>We recite in some detail the allegations of the complaint, accepting all well-pleaded facts as true. See <em>Wheatley </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Insurers Insolvency Fund, supra </em>at 596.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-6\">In 2005, Kraft agreed to sell commercial generator equipment to Power Wiring. Marino exercised pervasive control over Power Wiring when it contracted to buy Kraft\u2019s equipment. At the time Power Wiring entered into the contract with Kraft for the purchase of the equipment, Marino had caused Power Wiring to become insolvent, and it could not pay for the equipment. Power Wiring resold the equipment to a third party, which paid Power Wiring in full for the equipment and its installation. Rather than paying the proceeds of the resale to Kraft, Marino used these funds to pay personal obligations.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-7\">Marino caused Power Wiring to remain insolvent and to file for receivership in order to defraud its creditors, including Kraft. By causing Power Wiring to file for receivership under Massachusetts law, any judgment against Power Wiring was rendered essentially meaningless.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-8\">Marino purchased another entity, Integrated, which operated the same type of business as Power Wiring and serviced Power Wiring\u2019s former customers; Marino transferred substantially all of Power Wiring\u2019s assets to Integrated. The transfer of the as<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>sets of Power Wiring to Integrated was for no or nominal consideration. Substantially all of Power Wiring\u2019s employees were retained by Marino as employees of Integrated, and at Marino\u2019s instruction, Power Wiring\u2019s inventory, trucks, and tools were transferred to Integrated. Marino also instructed a client of Power Wiring to pay to Integrated monies it owed to Power Wiring.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-5\">In May, 2006, after Power Wiring failed to pay for the equipment it had purchased from Kraft, Kraft filed an action in the Superior Court, alleging breach of contract. Marino appeared at a preliminary hearing in connection with this action and represented that he personally would make arrangements to ensure payment of the debt. Marino died in June, 2007. In January, 2008, a default judgment entered against Power Wiring in the amount of $259,417.47.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-6\">Based on the specific allegations set forth in Kraft\u2019s complaint, and the arguments Kraft has made before us, we discern four claims that rely on the doctrine of corporate disregard, by which Kraft seeks to hold Marino and, hence, Marino\u2019s estate liable for Power Wiring\u2019s actions. Those claims allege breach of contract, fraudulent transfers under the UFTA, violations of G. L. c. 93A, and fraud. Another claim alleges that the transfer of Power Wiring\u2019s assets \u201cwas an unjust enrichment to the estate of John J. Marino\u201d and thus asserts a claim directly against the estate that it is unjustly retaining funds belonging to Kraft.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-7\">The corporate veil \u201cmay be pierced where\u201d the corporate principal exercises (1) \u201csome form of pervasive control\u201d over the activities of the corporation, and (2) \u201cthere is some fraudulent or injurious consequence\u201d as a result. <em>Scott </em>v. <em>NG US 1, Inc., </em>450 Mass. 760, 767 (2008), quoting <em>My Bread Baking Co. </em>v. <em>Cumberland Farms, Inc., </em>353 Mass. 614, 619 (1968).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> If Kraft can successfully pierce the corporate veil, then Kraft can pursue <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>these four underlying claims against the estate. In this appeal, we decide only whether each claim survives Marino\u2019s death, assuming for this purpose that Kraft can pierce the corporate veil. We do not decide whether Kraft\u2019s complaint has adequately stated claims upon which relief can be granted, because that issue is not before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-5\">i. <em>Breach of contract. </em>Although Kraft titles its first claim \u201cPiercing the Corporate Veil,\u201d the facts alleged state a cause of action that is, in substance, for breach of contract. Kraft alleges that Power Wiring committed a breach of its contract with Kraft by failing to pay for Kraft\u2019s generators. Because contract actions survive the death of a party at common law, <em>Gasior </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Gen. Hosp., supra </em>at 649, this claim should not have been dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-6\">ii. <em>Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act. </em>Kraft\u2019s second claim seeks relief under the UFTA, which is, as described in the statute, a \u201ccause of action with respect to a fraudulent transfer or obligation.\u201d G. L. c. 109A, \u00a7 10. The UFTA states that a \u201ctransfer made... by a debtor is fraudulent as to a creditor... if the debtor made the transfer . . . with actual intent to hinder, delay, or defraud any creditor of the debtor.\u201d G. L. c. 109A, \u00a7 5 <em>(a) </em>(1). A \u201ccreditor\u201d is \u201ca person who has a claim,\u201d a \u201cdebtor\u201d is \u201ca person who is liable on a claim,\u201d and a \u201cclaim\u201d is \u201ca right to payment.\u201d G. L. c. 109A, \u00a7 2. In the case of a fraudulent transfer, the UFTA provides for several possible remedies, including, inter alia, avoidance of the transfer, an attachment, an injunction, and \u201cany other relief the circumstances may require.\u201d G. L. c. 109A, \u00a7 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-7\">As the language of the UFTA makes clear, an action for relief under G. L. c. 109A, \u00a7 8, depends on the existence of an independently valid claim. In other words, the remedies available under the UFTA \u201cfurnish a convenient and expeditious <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>method by which creditors may satisfy their claims but they do not create claims.\u201d <em>Blumenthal </em>v. <em>Blumenthal, </em>303 Mass. 275, 279 (1939). Consequently, \u201c[i]f the claim is not established, then the whole proceedings fail and the bill must be dismissed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 278. See <em>Jorden </em>v. <em>Ball, </em>357 Mass. 468, 470 (1970). By way of example, we held in <em>Blumenthal </em>v. <em>Blumenthal, supra </em>at 280, that the plaintiff could not use the fraudulent conveyance law (the UFTA\u2019s predecessor) to set aside an allegedly fraudulent conveyance made by her husband, since she had no independently viable claim against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-5\">Because an action brought under the UFTA provides only a remedy for an independently valid claim, in order to assess whether the action to remedy a fraudulent transfer survives, we must analyze the initial conduct or transaction that gave the creditor a right to payment from the debtor. Where relief from a fraudulent transfer is premised on a contractual right to payment, the claim survives because contract actions survive at common law. See <em>Gasior </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Gen. Hosp., supra </em>at 649-651 (implied contractual terms in employment at will relationship). See also <em>Rendek </em>v. <em>Sheriff of Bristol County, supra </em>at 1017; <em>McStowe </em>v. <em>Bornstein, supra </em>at 806-807. Our decision in <em>Splaine </em>v. <em>Morrissey, </em>282 Mass. 217 (1933), upon which both sides rely, is not inconsistent with these principles. That case involved an allegedly fraudulent conveyance made by someone who died after making the conveyance. <em>Id. </em>at 219-220. We held that the conveyance was not fraudulent, without discussing whether the suit survived. <em>Id. </em>at 220-223. Because the plaintiff had a clear contractual right to payment from the decedent, survival was not an issue. See <em>id. </em>at 220. Compare <em>Portland Gas Light Co. </em>v. <em>Ruud, </em>242 Mass. 272, 274-275 (1922) (describing conveyance of defendant\u2019s home to his daughter to avoid paying damages in anticipated tort suit).</p>\n<p id=\"b172-6\">Here, the relief Kraft seeks is premised on a contractual right to payment from Power Wiring. Kraft asserts that Marino caused Power Wiring to commit a breach of its contract with Kraft by failing to pay Kraft for the generators, and that Marino caused Power Wiring to transfer its assets to Integrated \u201cwith the actual intent... to hinder, delay and defraud\u201d Kraft. Based on these specific allegations, Marino, as the alleged alter ego of Power <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>Wiring, is the \u201cdebtor,\u201d a \u201cperson who is liable on a claim,\u201d G. L. c. 109A, \u00a7 2, and Integrated is the \u201ctransferee.\u201d The underlying claim for which Marino is alleged to be the debtor is Power Wiring\u2019s contractual liability to Kraft.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Because the underlying claim for which Kraft seeks relief under the UFTA is contractual, not tortious, the UFTA claim survives Marino\u2019s death, and the claim should not have been dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-5\">iii. <em>Chapter 93A. </em>Kraft\u2019s third cause of action alleges violations of G. L. c. 93A. Kraft seeks relief under G. L. c. 93, \u00a7 11, which governs commercial transactions between two parties \u201cacting in a \u2018business context.\u2019 \u201d <em>Milliken &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>Duro Textiles, LLC, </em>451 Mass. 547, 563 (2008). <em>Linkage Corp. </em>v. <em>Trustees of Boston Univ., </em>425 Mass. 1, 22-23, cert, denied, 522 U.S. 1015 (1997).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Although the Legislature \u201coriginally enacted [G. L.] c. 93A to improve the commercial relationship between consumers and businessmen ...[,] the addition of \u00a7 11 by St. 1972, c. 614, \u00a7 2, [extended] these protections ... to persons engaged in trade or commerce in business transactions with other persons also engaged in trade or commerce\u201d (citation omitted). <em>Manning </em>v. <em>Zuckerman, </em>388 Mass. 8, 12 (1983). \u201cThe development of the statute, therefore, suggests that the unfair or deceptive acts or practices prohibited are those that may arise in dealings between discrete, independent business entities . . . <em>T Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b173-6\">We have not previously had occasion to decide whether a claim pursuant to G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 11, survives the death of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>party.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The question poses unique challenges, in that G. L. c. 93A \u201ccreated new substantive rights by making conduct unlawful which was not unlawful under the common law or any prior statute.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>DeCotis, </em>366 Mass. 234, 244 n.8 (1974). As we noted in that case, G. L. c. 93A defines unfair acts or practices by reference to interpretations of those terms in the Federal Trade Commission Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 45(a)(1) (2006), in which G. L. c. 93A has its roots. <em>Id. </em>at 241-242. The Federal Trade Commission Act, like G. L. c. 93A, was enacted to expand consumer protection beyond the \u201cnarrow approach of what the common law regarded as unfair competition, and in effect to permit, by the gradual process of judicial inclusion and exclusion, a new definition of what is unfair.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 242.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-16\">We have thus classified some G. L. c. 93A claims as contract-based, see <em>Anthony\u2019s Pier Four, Inc. </em>v. <em>HBC Assocs., </em>411 Mass. 451, 474 (1991),<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> others as tort-based, see <em>Datacomm Interface, Inc. </em>v. <em>Computerworld, Inc., </em>396 Mass. 760, 778 (1986),<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> and still others as \u201cneither wholly tortious nor wholly contractual in nature.\u201d <em>Kattar </em>v. <em>Demoulas, </em>433 Mass. 1, 12 (2000), quoting <em>Slaney </em>v. <em>Westwood Auto, Inc., </em>366 Mass. 688, 704 (1975). As such, a claim under G. L. c. 93A may not lend itself readily to categorization as contractual or tortious for purposes of determining whether it survives the death of a defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-26\">We have, however, previously considered whether a statutory cause of action that did not exist at common law survives or abates on the death of a party. In <em>Gasior </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Gen. Hosp., supra </em>at 650-651, we considered whether an employment discrimination claim brought under G. L. c. 15 IB survived the death of the plaintiff. We determined that the claim survived, because the employment relationship could be viewed as a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>contract, and the invidious discrimination prohibited by G. L. c. 15 IB was an implied term of that contractual relationship. Similarly, we conclude that a cause of action brought under G. L. c. 93A will survive if it is, in essence, contractual. We leave for another day whether claims brought under G. L. c. 93A that are not contractual nonetheless survive a party\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-5\">In order to assess whether Kraft\u2019s G. L. c. 93A claim should be classified as contractual, such that it survives Marino\u2019s death, we look to the specific allegations of the complaint. Kraft alleges that Marino caused Power Wiring to transfer assets to himself and Integrated, so that Power Wiring would be unable to fulfil its contractual obligations to Kraft. The gravamen of Kraft\u2019s G. L. c. 93A claim, therefore, is that Marino undermined Kraft\u2019s right to payment under the contract by intentionally \u201crender[ing] Power Wiring insolvent and unable to pay its obligations\u201d to Kraft. Based on these allegations, we conclude that Kraft\u2019s G. L. c. 93A claim is contractual in nature and therefore survives Marino\u2019s death; dismissal of this claim was error.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-6\">In its claim under G. L. c. 93A, however, Kraft seeks not only compensatory damages but also multiple damages of two to three times compensatory damages. Chapter 93A authorizes multiple damages of two to three times a plaintiff\u2019s \u201cactual damages\u201d only if a defendant\u2019s conduct was \u201cwillful or knowing.\u201d G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7\u00a7 9, 11. The imposition of multiple damages is \u201cdesigned to impose a penalty . . . that varies with the culpability of the defendant.\u201d <em>International Fid. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Wilson, </em>387 Mass. 841, 856 (1983). \u201cLike other statutes containing multiple damage provisions, [G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7\u00a7 9 and 11,] reflect \u2018the Legislature\u2019s displeasure with the proscribed conduct and its desire to deter such conduct and encourage vindictive lawsuits.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 857, quoting <em>McGrath </em>v. <em>Mishara, </em>386 Mass. 74, 85 (1982). See <em>Haddad </em>v. <em>Gonzalez, </em>410 Mass. 855, 869 (1991) (\u201cIt is established that deterrence is an important goal of the multiple damages provisions of c. 93A\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b175-7\">Because the assessment of multiple damages is premised on a defendant\u2019s wrongful conduct, and not the amount of harm suffered by a plaintiff, the multiple damages authorized by G. L. c. 93A \u201care essentially punitive in nature.\u201d <em>Darviris </em>v. <em>Petros, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>442 Mass. 274, 283-284 (2004), quoting <em>McEvoy Travel Bur., Inc. </em>v. <em>Norton Co., </em>408 Mass. 704, 717 (1990). Like punitive damages in tort law, multiple damages under G. L. c. 93A serve the twin \u201cgoals of punishment and deterrence.\u201d <em>International Fid. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Wilson, supra </em>at 858. Compare Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 908(1) (1979) (\u201cPunitive damages are damages, other than compensatory or nominal damages, awarded against a person to punish him for his outrageous conduct and to deter him and others like him from similar conduct in the future\u201d). Such goals can no longer be achieved when the defendant in a given case has died. Upon an individual\u2019s death, the law can no longer punish him or deter him from future misconduct; at most, the law can make an example of a deceased defendant by punishing his estate. See Reynolds, Punitive Damages After Death \u2014 Can Tort Law Create Heaven and Hell?, 26 Okla. L. Rev. 63, 71 (1973) (\u201cPresumably he is now beyond earthly punishment; and to assess such damages against his estate is to visit the sins of the father on the sons\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b176-5\">The Legislature has addressed the survival of punitive damages in tort actions in the Commonwealth. General Laws c. 230, \u00a7 2, provides: \u201cIf an action of tort is commenced or prosecuted against the executor or administrator of the person originally liable, the plaintiff shall recover only the value of the goods taken, or the damage actually sustained, without vindictive or exemplary damages, or damages for any alleged outrage to the feelings of the injured party.\u201d We construe G. L. c. 230, \u00a7 2, as indicative of a legislative policy determination that the goals of punitive damages are no longer served when the wrongdoer has died. This view is expressed in the majority of jurisdictions that have decided this issue,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> and is reflected in statutes similar to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>our own in other jurisdictions.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> See generally Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 926(b) (1979) (\u201cthe death of the tortfeasor terminates liability for punitive damages\u201d).<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b177-5\">For these reasons, we conclude that multiple damages may not be sought under G. L. c. 93A when the defendant has died.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> The focus of multiple damages is the defendant\u2019s culpability, since multiple damages are triggered only when the defendant\u2019s conduct was \u201cwillful or knowing.\u201d G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7\u00a7 9, 11. See <em>International Fid. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Wilson, supra </em>at 858. Like punitive damages in tort actions, multiple damages under G. L. c. 93A can no longer achieve the goals of punishing a defendant or deterring him from future misconduct when the wrongdoer has died, and, therefore, they can no longer be imposed.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b178-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>iv. <em>Fraud. </em>Kraft alleges that Marino misrepresented to Kraft that Power Wiring was not insolvent, knowing that Power Wiring was actually insolvent, for the purpose of inducing Kraft to contract with Power Wiring.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-7\">Under the common law, a claim of fraud abates upon the death of either party. See <em>Metropolitan Life Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>De Nicola, </em>317 Mass. 416, 419 (1944) (\u201ca suit in equity brought merely to recover damages for fraud abates upon the death of either party, just as an action at law for deceit does\u201d). Moreover, the survival statute does not include fraud among the torts that survive death, unless the fraud results in \u201cdamage to real or personal property.\u201d G. L. c. 228, \u00a7 1 (2) <em>(d). </em>See <em>Read </em>v. <em>Hatch, </em>19 Pick. 47, 47-48 (1837) (claim of fraudulently inducing sale of goods did not survive defendant\u2019s death under survival statute, because \u201c[a] mere fraud or cheat, by which one sustains a pecuniary loss, cannot be regarded as a damage done to personal estate\u201d). See also <em>Piper </em>v. <em>Childs, </em>290 Mass. 560, 565-566 (1935); <em>Givens </em>v. <em>Powell, </em>239 Mass. 110, 113 (1921); <em>Rockwell </em>v. <em>Furness, </em>215 Mass. 557, 558 (1913); <em>Jenks </em>v. <em>Hoag, </em>179 Mass. 583, 586 (1901); <em>Houghton </em>v. <em>Butler, 166 </em>Mass. 547, 548 (1896); <em>Leggate </em>v. <em>Moulton, </em>115 Mass. 552, 553 (1874).</p>\n<p id=\"b178-24\">Kraft\u2019s reliance on <em>Metropolitan Life Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>De Nicola, supra </em>at 419-420, is misplaced. In that case, we held that a suit to annul a contract for fraud or mistake survives, even though a claim for fraud does not survive. <em>Id. </em>Kraft interprets the case to mean that a claim of fraud will survive whenever the underlying dispute arises out of a contract. This reading is overbroad. Indeed, the very purpose of Kraft\u2019s lawsuit here is to enforce its contract with Power Wiring, rather than to void the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-32\">Kraft is correct that tort claims arising out of an existing contractual relationship may survive death. See, e.g., <em>McStowe </em>v. <em>Bornstein, </em>377 Mass. 804, 807 (1979). That case, however, involved alleged legal malpractice that occurred during an existing contractual relationship between the plaintiff and his attorney. See <em>id. </em>at 808 (\u201cthe existence of a contractual relationship <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>between the plaintiff and the deceased attorney permits the plaintiff\u2019s claim against the attorney to survive the attorney\u2019s death\u201d). Here, Kraft does not assert a preexisting contractual relationship with Marino at the time that Marino committed the alleged fraud. Rather, the alleged fraudulent conduct was that Marino induced the contractual relationship. A claim of fraudulently inducing a party to enter into a contract does not survive under either the survival statute or at common law. See <em>Read </em>v. <em>Hatch, supra </em>at 47-48.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b179-5\"><em>Conclusion. </em>So much of the judgment dismissing Kraft\u2019s claims for breach of contract, relief under the UFTA, violations of G. L. c. 93A, and unjust enrichment, is reversed. The dismissal of Kraft\u2019s remaining claims is affirmed. The case is remanded to the Superior Court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b164-9\">Because of the bases on which Kraft Power Corporation (Kraft) relied in its pleadings, and the manner in which it has argued the issue before us, whether certain of Kraft\u2019s claims survive depends on whether Kraft can pierce the corporate veil of Power Wiring &amp; Emergency Response Inc. (Power Wiring). We do not suggest that, had the pleadings been drafted differently, these causes of action would necessarily require that a plaintiff be able to pierce the corporate veil.

Corporate veils are rarely pierced. See <em>id. </em>That there are allegations of fraudulent conduct in the complaint that support piercing a corporate veil does not mean, as the defendants argue, that \u201cthe gist of Kraft[\u2019s] claim to pierce the corporate veil is tortious in nature\u201d and therefore does not survive the death of a party. That argument assumes, incorrectly, that the doctrine is an independent cause of action. The equitable doctrine may be employed to hold Marino liable for certain breaches or wrongs, even after his death, only so long as the underlying claims survive under applicable law.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b167-8\">General Laws c. 228, \u00a7 1, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b167-9\">\u201cIn addition to the actions which survive by the common law, the following shall survive: \u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b167-10\">\u201c(1) Actions under chapter two hundred and forty-seven;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b167-11\">\u201c(2) Actions of tort (a) for assault, battery, imprisonment or other damage to the person; <em>(b) </em>for consequential damages arising out of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>injury to the person and consisting of expenses incurred by a husband, wife, parent or guardian for medical, nursing, hospital or surgical services in connection with or on account of such injury; (c) for goods taken or carried away or converted; or <em>(d) </em>for damage to real or personal property; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-12\">\u201c(3) Actions against sheriffs for the misconduct or negligence of themselves or their deputies.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b168-14\">\u201cThe original reasons for the nonsurvival of torts at common law have been largely obscured in antiquity.\u201d <em>Harrison </em>v. <em>Loyal Protective Life Ins.

See, e.g., Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 926(b) (1979) (\u201cthe death of the tortfeasor terminates liability for punitive damages\u201d). It does so, suggesting that the multiple damages remedy set forth in G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 11, serves the same goals as punitive damages in tort law. <em>Ante </em>at 159.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The court\u2019s reasoning and the result it reaches on this point are puzzling at best.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-5\">General Laws c. 93A, \u00a7 11, entitles a plaintiff <em>to </em>recover both actual and multiple damages as a matter of statutory right on account of an injury caused by the defendant\u2019s knowing or wilful violation of G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 2. To the extent that Kraft\u2019s right to pursue actual damages under G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 11, survives only because its substantive claim is contractual rather than tor-tious in nature, it follows logically that Kraft\u2019s right to seek multiple damages should also survive. Both forms of damages recovery derive wholly from the same statutory source.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-6\">Moreover, I am not persuaded that the comparison of tortfea-sors with those who purposefully violate G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 11, is especially useful when considering whether multiple damages under the latter should survive. There is ample reason to conclude that multiple damages should be available against the estates of those who, by their wilful or knowing misconduct in a business context, violate G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 11, a statute with broad remedial purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-7\">We have previously considered whether punitive damages provided for by a statute with broad remedial purposes survive the death of a litigant.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In <em>Gasior </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Gen. Hosp., </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>446 Mass. 645 (2006) <em>(Gasior), </em>we determined that the punitive damages available under G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7 9, survived the death of the plaintiff, whose substantive claim was contractual in nature. In so doing, we reasoned that the damages were \u201cpart of a scheme to vindicate a \u2018broader public interest in eradicating systemic discrimination [at work].\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 654, quoting <em>Stonehill College </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Comm\u2019n Against Discrimination, </em>441 Mass. 549, 563, cert, denied sub nom. <em>Wilfert Bros. Realty Co. </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Comm\u2019n Against Discrimination, </em>543 U.S. 979 (2004). Allowing the punitive damages remedy to survive death was thus \u201cconsistent with the broad remedial purposes\u201d of the statute. <em>Id. </em>at 655. For similar reasons, I believe that the multiple damages remedy available under G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 11, should survive death.* **<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b181-5\">Like the punitive damages that were found to survive death in <em>Gasior, </em>the multiple damages available under G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 11, are part of a legislative scheme to vindicate broader public interests. In G. L. c. 151B, it is to \u201ceradicate] systemic discrimination\u201d in the context of employment. <em>Gasior, supra </em>at 654. In G. L. c. 93A, it is to eradicate unfair methods of competition or deceptive acts or practices in trade and commerce. See <em>International Fid. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Wilson, </em>387 Mass. 841, 857 (1983), quoting <em>McGrath </em>v. <em>Mishara, </em>386 Mass. 74, 85 (1982) (multiple damages provisions of G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 11, \u201creflect \u2018the Legislature\u2019s displeasure with the proscribed conduct and its desire to deter such conduct and encourage vindicative lawsuits\u2019 \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b181-6\">The court takes the view, however, that since multiple damages are unable to deter a particular deceased wrongdoer from further misconduct, multiple damages awarded against his estate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>serve no deterrent function at all and thus should not survive. <em>Ante </em>at 158. This is an unduly restrictive view of deterrence. We have previously explained that multiple damages are meant to deter both \u201cactual and potential wrongdoers.\u201d <em>Drywall Sys., Inc. </em>v. <em>ZVI Constr. Co., </em>435 Mass. 664, 670 (2002). While allowing multiple damages to survive against Marino\u2019s estate would of course have no deterrent effect upon Marino, it might well deter potential wrongdoers from similarly engaging in knowing or wilful conduct that violates G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7\u00a7 2 and 11. The realization that heirs stand to lose more than they might otherwise gain from the fruits of the wrongdoer\u2019s purposeful misconduct may well serve to deter the potential wrongdoer from engaging in unfair methods of competition and unfair or deceptive business practices.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-5\">Allowing the multiple damages remedy available under G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 11, to survive death is also consistent with the statute\u2019s alternative purpose of \u201cencourag[ing] vindicative lawsuits.\u201d See <em>McGrath </em>v. <em>Mishara, supra </em>at 85. \u201cMultiple damages are \u2018the appropriate punishment\u2019 for forcing plaintiffs to litigate clearly valid claims.\u201d <em>International Fid. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Wilson, supra </em>at 857, quoting <em>Heller </em>v. <em>Silverbranch Constr. Corp., </em>376 Mass. 621, 628 (1978). Mindful that we have permitted punitive damages under G. L. c. 15 IB to survive death because doing so is \u201c[c]onsistent with the broad remedial purposes\u201d of the statute, <em>Gasior, supra </em>at 654, G. L. c. 93A, too, has been described as a statute of \u201cbroad impact\u201d with \u201cfar-reaching effects.\u201d <em>Slaney </em>v. <em>Westwood Auto, Inc., </em>366 Mass. 688, 693 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b182-6\">Nor should it be ignored that a \u201cprime goal\u201d of the multiple damages provision of G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 11, is \u201c[t]he promotion of reasonable settlement offers.\u201d <em>International Fid. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Wilson, supra </em>at 857. See G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 11 (if wrongdoer tenders \u201coffer of settlement for single damages\u201d that is rejected, and court finds that tendered offer \u201cwas reasonable in relation to the injury suffered, then the court shall not award more than single damages\u201d). The multiple damages provision of G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 11, was \u201cdesigned\u201d by the Legislature \u201cto make it \u2018unprofitable\u2019 for a defendant to ignore meritorious claims.\u201d <em>International Fid. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Wilson, supra </em>at 857, quoting <em>Heller </em>v. <em>Silverbranch Constr. Corp., supra </em>at 627. By limiting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>a plaintiff\u2019s remedy to single damages following the death of one who is alleged to have been in knowing or wilful violation of G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7\u00a7 2 and 11, the court \u201cdilut[es]\u201d the estate\u2019s incentive to settle and thereby thwarts a \u201cprime goal\u201d of the Legislature in providing for multiple damages. <em>International Fid. Ins. Co. </em>v. Wilson, <em>supra </em>at 858.</p>\n<p id=\"AgY\">Lastly, any suggestion that allowing multiple damages to be imposed on an estate somehow unfairly penalizes innocent heirs is something of a red herring. Had Marino died the day after an adverse judgment under G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 11, entered against him, inclusive of an award of multiple damages, his estate would have been responsible for paying it. His heirs\u2019 noninvolvement in the wrongdoing would not have saved them from paying the price for it. See G. L. c. 190B, \u00a7\u00a7 3-801 to 3-816. Multiple damages under G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 11, are only available for \u201cwillful or knowing violation[s]\u201d of G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7\u00a7 2 and 11, and should not be precluded because of the untimely death of the wrongdoer.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b179-9\"> Kraft clarifies in its brief that the claims asserted in its complaint against the estate under the Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act, G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 11, and for fraud, all depend on its ability to pierce the corporate veil of Power Wiring &amp; Emergency Response Inc. Because Kraft does not bring such claims directly against Marino\u2019s estate, I understand the court to be expressing no view as to whether, in the absence of corporate disregard, such direct claims would be capable of surviving death.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b180-8\">The court also cites G. L. c. 230, \u00a7 2, which states, \u201cIf an action of tort is commenced or prosecuted against the executor or administrator of the person originally liable, the plaintiff shall recover only the value of the goods taken, or the damage actually sustained, without vindictive or exemplary damages. . . Rather than supporting its conclusion that multiple damages under G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 11, are not intended to survive death, it suggests the contrary, since the Legislature explicitly limited its prohibition against punitive damages after death to \u201caction[s] of tort.\u201d It does not employ, as it could have, a more encompassing alternative such as, \u201cIf any action is commenced. . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b180-9\">General Laws c. 151B prohibits discrimination <em>in </em>employment. In the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>event of violation, G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7 9, generally provides, inter alia, for punitive damages but, in the context of age discrimination in employment, provides for multiple damages upon a finding \u201cthat the act or practice complained of was committed with knowledge, or reason to know, that [it] violated the provisions of . . . section four.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b181-10\">The court distinguishes <em>Gasior </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Gen. Hosp., </em>446 Mass. 645 (2006), on the grounds that the decedent in that case was the plaintiff, and that allowing punitive damages to survive his death furthered the deterrent purposes of the statute by punishing the specific defendant who acted wrongfully. <em>Ante </em>at note 21. This distinction rests upon a narrow view of deterrence which I reject.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
