L. c. 265, \u00a7 47, to order a juvenile to wear a global positioning system device that will monitor his whereabouts (GPS monitoring) as a condition of probation where a juvenile is adjudicated delinquent and placed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"808\">*808</page-number>on probation for committing a \u201csex offense,\u201d a \u201csex offense involving a child,\u201d or a \u201csexually violent offense,\u201d as defined in G. L. c. 6, \u00a7 178C. We conclude that, when \u00a7 47 is read in its entirety, it is not apparent that the Legislature intended to apply mandatory GPS monitoring to juveniles placed on probation as a result of having been adjudicated delinquent and thereby eliminate the discretion granted to Juvenile Court judges to render individualized dispositions consistent with the best interests of the child. We also conclude that, where the Legislature has established the statutory principle that, \u201cas far as practicable, [juveniles] shall be treated, not as criminals, but as children in need of aid, encouragement and guidance,\u201d G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 53, we will not interpret a statute affecting the delinquency adjudications of juveniles to conflict with this principle in the absence of clear legislative intent. Here, where such clear legislative intent is absent, we conclude that a Juvenile Court judge retains the discretion, based on the totality of the circumstances, to determine whether GPS monitoring should be imposed as a condition of probation for a juvenile who is adjudicated delinquent after committing a sex offense.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b826-5\"><em>Background. </em>The juvenile, a fifteen year old boy, was accused of rubbing his fingers over the clothing covering a female classmate\u2019s genital area in physical education class. He was arraigned in the Juvenile Court on a complaint alleging indecent assault and battery on a person under the age of fourteen, in violation of G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 13B. On July 19, 2011, he pleaded delinquent and was placed on supervised probation for a period of six months, with the conditions that he stay away from and have no contact with the victim and that he participate in coun-selling.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On the same day as the plea, the judge granted the juvenile\u2019s assented-to motion to be relieved of his duty to register <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"809\">*809</page-number>as a sex offender, implicitly finding that the juvenile did not \u201cpose a risk of reoffense or danger to the public.\u201d See G. L. c. 6, \u00a7 178E (/). Although the juvenile was not advised during the plea colloquy that GPS monitoring would be required as a condition of probation, the judge entered an order on August 3, 2011, requiring the juvenile to wear a GPS monitoring device during the term of his probation. On August 30,2011, the juvenile filed a motion for relief from GPS monitoring. The judge denied the motion, recognizing that GPS monitoring \u201ccertainly places a juvenile in a situation where [he] may be excluded from healthy, normal activities and rehabilitative activities,\u201d but concluding that under \u00a7 47, the judge had \u201cno discretion to relieve the [juvenile] from the obligation of wearing a GPS.\u201d We granted the juvenile\u2019s application for direct appellate review.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-4\"><em>Discussion. </em>General Laws c. 265, \u00a7 47, provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b827-5\">\u201cAny person who is placed on probation for any offense listed within the definition of \u2018sex offense\u2019, a \u2018sex offense involving a child\u2019 or a \u2018sexually violent offense\u2019, as defined in section 178C of chapter 6, shall, as a requirement of any term of probation, wear a global positioning system device, or any comparable device, administered by the commissioner of probation, at all times for the length of his probation for any such offense. The commissioner of probation, in addition to any other conditions, shall establish defined geographic exclusion zones including, but not limited to, the areas in and around the victim\u2019s residence, place of employment and school and other areas defined to minimize the probationer\u2019s contact with children, if applicable. If the probationer enters an excluded zone, as defined by the terms of his probation, the probationer\u2019s location data shall be immediately transmitted to the police department in the municipality wherein the violation occurred and the commissioner of probation, by telephone, electronic beeper, paging device or other appropriate means. If the commissioner or the probationer\u2019s probation officer has probable cause to believe that the probationer has violated this term of his probation, the commissioner or the probationer\u2019s probation officer shall arrest the probationer pursuant to section 3 of chapter 279. . . .\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b828-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"810\">*810</page-number>The Commonwealth argues that it is plain from the first sentence of \u00a7 47 that mandatory GPS monitoring applies to juveniles, because \u201c[a]ny person\u201d includes any juvenile, and \u201cshall\u201d is \u201cunderstood to be a mandatory term.\u201d We agree that, in interpreting a statute, \u201c[w]e begin with the language of the statute,\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Raposo, </em>453 Mass. 739, 743 (2009) <em>(Raposo), </em>and \u201c[wjhen a statute is plain and unambiguous, we interpret it according to its ordinary meaning.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 745, quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Russ R., </em>433 Mass. 515, 520 (2001). But we look to the language of the entire statute, not just a single sentence, and attempt to interpret all of its terms \u201charmoniously to effectuate the intent of the Legislature.\u201d <em>Id. </em>See <em>DiFiore </em>v. <em>American Airlines, Inc., </em>454 Mass. 486, 491 (2009) (\u201cWhere possible, we construe the various provisions of a statute in harmony with one another, recognizing that the Legislature did not intend internal contradiction\u201d). Our goal is \u201cto determine the intent of the Legislature in enacting the statute, \u2018ascertained from all its words construed by the ordinary and approved usage of the language, considered in connection with the cause of its enactment, the mischief or imperfection to be remedied and the main object to be accomplished, to the end that the purpose of its framers may be effectuated.\u2019 \u201d <em>Halebian </em>v. <em>Berv, </em>457 Mass. 620, 628-629 (2010), quoting <em>Harvard Crimson, Inc. </em>v. <em>President &amp; Fellows of Harvard College, </em>445 Mass. 745, 749 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b828-5\">Although the language of the first sentence of \u00a7 47 suggests that the Legislature intended to include juveniles within its mandate, the language of the second and fourth sentences of the statute suggests that the Legislature understood that the probationers subject to mandatory GPS monitoring would be adults. The second sentence requires the Commissioner of Probation to establish \u201cgeographic exclusion zones\u201d that the probationer may not enter, including \u201cthe areas in and around the victim\u2019s . . . school and other areas defined to minimize the probationer\u2019s contact with children, if applicable.\u201d It is unlikely that the Legislature intended to minimize a probationer\u2019s contact with children where the probationer himself is a child.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> And although it may be appropriate in many instances to bar a juvenile who <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"811\">*811</page-number>has committed a sexual offense from the school the victim attends even if the juvenile and the victim had been attending the same school, it is unlikely that the Legislature intended to mandate such an exclusion for all juvenile probationers adjudicated delinquent for a qualifying sex offense, especially where a juvenile may be placed on probation for engaging in an indecent touching of a child under fourteen years of age or sexual intercourse with a child under sixteen years of age that would be consensual if a child of that age were legally capable of consent. See G. L. c. 6, \u00a7 178C (including indecent assault and battery on child under fourteen years of age, in violation of G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 13B, and statutory rape of child, in violation of G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 23, within definition of \u201csex offense involving a child\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b829-5\">The fourth sentence of \u00a7 47 provides that, where a probation officer has probable cause to believe that the probationer has violated his probation by entering an excluded zone, the probation officer \u201cshall arrest the probationer <em>pursuant to [G. L. c. 279, \u00a7 3]\u2019\u2019\u2019 </em>(emphasis added). General Laws c. 279, \u00a7 3, which provides that a probation officer may arrest a person under probation supervision without a warrant and take him before the court, applies only to adults, not to juveniles.* **<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> General Laws c. 119, \u00a7 59, governs a probation officer\u2019s arrest of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"812\">*812</page-number>child on probation.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> If the Legislature intended that mandatory GPS monitoring apply both to adult and juvenile probationers, one would expect that, in \u00a7 47, the Legislature would have referenced both G. L. c. 279, \u00a7 3, and G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 59, in providing for the arrest of probationers who violated the terms of their probation by entering the excluded zone.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-4\">In view of this ambiguity, we look to the legislative history of \u00a7 47 to see if it sheds light on whether the Legislature intended \u00a7 47 to apply to juvenile probationers. It does not. In early 2005, the Commonwealth initiated a program to utilize a global positioning system and electronic bracelets to monitor the movements of level three sex offenders placed on parole and probation. See St. 2004, c. 352, \u00a7 70 (providing \u201cthat $1,000,000 shall be expended for the Commissioner of Probation to implement a global positioning system in collaboration with the Massachusetts parole board utilizing tamper free ankle bracelets to track level 3 sex offenders actively on parole and sex offenders currently being supervised by the office of the commissioner of probation and deemed appropriate for said tracking by said commissioner\u201d). See also Global Positioning to Track Sex Offenders, Boston Globe, Sept. 21, 2004, at Al; House News Service, Sept. 20, 2004. In 2006, the Legislature enacted \u201cAn Act increasing the statute of limitations for sexual crimes against children,\u201d which inserted G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 47. St. 2006, c. 303, \u00a7 8. The original version of the bill adopted by the House required GPS tracking of \u201c[a]ny individual convicted of a sex offense . . . and classified as a level 2 or level 3 sex offender ... at all times for the length of any post-release supervision.\u201d 2006 House Doc. No. 5234, \u00a7 7. The Senate\u2019s amendments to the bill created separate sections dealing with parolees and probationers, and expanded the act\u2019s coverage to include \u201c[a]ny person who is placed on probation\u201d for a sex offense. See <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"813\">*813</page-number><em>Raposo, supra </em>at 747; 2006 Senate J. 2678. The House concurred in the Senate\u2019s amendments. 2006 House J. 2204. We have found nothing in the legislative history that suggests that the Legislature considered whether the broader scope of the Senate\u2019s language would place juvenile probationers within its rubric.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-5\">We confronted a comparable ambiguity in \u00a7 47 in <em>Raposo, </em>where we were asked to decide whether the requirement of GPS monitoring applied to all probationers, including those placed on pretrial probation under G. L. c. 276, \u00a7 87, or only to probationers who were placed on probation after a conviction of one of the designated sex crimes. <em>Raposo, supra </em>at 740, 744-748. There, the Commonwealth argued that the first sentence of \u00a7 47 imposed the statutory mandate on \u201c[a]ny person who is placed on probation\u201d for a sex offense, and that the plain meaning of this unambiguous language includes those on \u201cprobation of any kind \u2014 a temporary placement pending trial, a pretrial disposition of the case, or probation ordered by a judge as part of the disposition of a case after conviction.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 744-745. We noted that the statute spoke of \u201c[a]ny person who is placed on probation <em>for any [sex] offense\u201d </em>(emphasis added) and occasionally referred to the \u201cprobationer\u201d as an \u201coffender,\u201d and concluded that the Legislature intended the statute to be internally consistent, \u201cand therefore intended the term \u2018probationer\u2019 to cover only those defendants who had been convicted and sentenced to a term of probation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 746.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-6\">In this case, as in <em>Raposo, </em>a literal reading of the phrase \u201c[a]ny person who is placed on probation\u201d would be inconsistent with other provisions of \u00a7 47 that suggest that the Legislature intended that the GPS monitoring mandate be limited to adults who were placed on probation after being convicted of a sex offense. As a general rule, where \u201ca statute can plausibly be found to be ambiguous,\u201d the rule of lenity requires that the juvenile be given the benefit of the ambiguity. <em>Charles C. </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>415 Mass. 58, 70 (1993), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Roucoulet, </em>413 Mass. 647, 652 (1992). But we need not rely solely on the rule of lenity to conclude that the ambiguity in \u00a7 47 must be interpreted to exclude juvenile probationers from the requirement of mandatory GPS monitoring. The more compelling reason to reach this conclusion is that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"814\">*814</page-number>interpreting the ambiguity to mandate GPS monitoring for juvenile probationers would fundamentally conflict with the long-standing statutory principle set forth in G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 53, that \u00a7\u00a7 52-63, \u201cshall be liberally construed so that the care, custody and discipline of the children brought before the court shall approximate as nearly as possible that which they should receive from their parents, and that, as far as practicable, they shall be treated, not as criminals, but as children in need of aid, encouragement and guidance.\u201d See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Matranga, </em>455 Mass. 45, 51 (2009), quoting <em>Charland </em>v. <em>Muzi Motors, Inc., </em>417 Mass. 580, 582-583 (1994) (\u201ca statute is to be interpreted in harmony with prior enactments to give rise to a consistent body of law\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b832-5\">We have recognized that, in accordance with these statutory principles, our juvenile justice system \u201cis primarily rehabilitative, cognizant of the inherent differences between juvenile and adult offenders, and geared toward \u2018the correction and redemption to society of delinquent children.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Magnus M., </em>461 Mass. 459, 461 (2012), quoting <em>Metcalf </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>338 Mass. 648, 651 (1959). See R.L. Ireland, Juvenile Law \u00a7 1.3, at 18 (2d ed. 2006) (\u201cThe rationale of [the dual system for adult and juvenile offenders] is diminished culpability: deviant behavior of children may be regarded as generally less culpable than similar adult behavior for the reason that a child\u2019s capacity to be culpable ... is not as fixed or as absolute as that of an adult\u201d). General Laws c. 119, \u00a7 58, provides a Juvenile Court judge with the discretion necessary to carry out these redemptive principles, authorizing a judge, where a child is adjudicated delinquent, to place the case on file or \u201cplace the child in the care of a probation officer for such time and on such conditions as [the judge] deems appropriate.\u201d See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Magnus M., supra, </em>quoting <em>Police Comm\u2019r of Boston </em>v. <em>Municipal Court of the Dorchester Dist., </em>374 Mass. 640, 667 (1978) (we have \u201cempowered Juvenile Court judges with \u2018very broad discretion . . . with regard to disposition\u2019 \u201d); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Balboni, </em>419 Mass. 42, 46 (1994) (\u201cjudge has very broad discretion in the Commonwealth\u2019s effort to rehabilitate the child and to further the child\u2019s best interest\u201d). If \u00a7 47 applied to juvenile probationers adjudicated delinquent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"815\">*815</page-number>because of the commission of a sex offense, a Juvenile Court judge would no longer have the discretion to determine what conditions of probation would be appropriate for the juvenile, as otherwise permitted under \u00a7 58, because the condition of GPS monitoring would be mandatory, regardless of whether such monitoring was necessary to protect the victim of the sex offense or prospective victims, and regardless of the potential adverse impact the wearing of such a device may have on the juvenile\u2019s prospects for rehabilitation. As a result, the delinquent child would be treated as a criminal, not as a child in need of aid, encouragement, and guidance, as required under \u00a7 53.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-5\">The facts of this case demonstrate how the application of \u00a7 47 to juveniles could interfere with a child\u2019s rehabilitation and stigmatize the child as a criminal. \u201cA GPS device, as implemented by the Commissioner of Probation, . . . consists of two pieces of electronic equipment: an ankle bracelet, which is permanently attached to the probationer, and a GPS-enabled cellular telephone, which communicates with the ankle bracelet and transmits the probationer\u2019s current location to the probation department.\u201d <em>Raposo, supra </em>at 740. The juvenile\u2019s mother attested, and the Commonwealth did not dispute, that, as a result of having what she described as \u201ca large, black box\u201d attached to the juvenile\u2019s ankle, the juvenile has become \u201cwithdrawn, anxious and depressed.\u201d He is embarrassed to see his extended family because of his shame about wearing the device, his younger sister teases him about it, and his friends ridiculed him when the unit began to \u201cbeep\u201d in their presence. He used to participate in an after-school program where he would swim three or four times per week, but he was unable to do that because the unit cannot be submerged in water. He enjoyed playing basketball, but stopped playing because he could not hide the unit while playing and he was \u201cextremely anxious that other kids will see it.\u201d He was \u201capprehensive and anxious\u201d about starting high school because he learned that \u201chis new school has been made aware of his situation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b833-6\">We have recognized that, as currently implemented, GPS monitoring is inherently stigmatizing, a modern-day \u201cscarlet letter.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cory, </em>454 Mass. 559, 570 n.18 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"816\">*816</page-number>(2009). \u201cTo the extent that the ankle bracelet portion of the GPS device is potentially visible to the public, it may have the additional punitive effect of exposing the offender to persecution or ostracism, or at least placing the offender in fear of such consequences.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We have also recognized that, in exercising the discretion bestowed on a Juvenile Court judge by \u00a7 58, the \u201cavoidance of attaching the stigma of a criminal to the child is of great importance.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Balboni, supra. </em>See <em>Metcalf </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b834-4\">We are not persuaded that in enacting \u00a7 47 the Legislature intended to impose \u201cthe stigma of a criminal\u201d on a child adjudicated delinquent because of a sex offense in the absence of an individualized determination by a Juvenile Court judge that the need for GPS monitoring to protect the safety of the victim and prospective victims overrode the damage that wearing such a device may have on the child\u2019s rehabilitation. Nor are we persuaded that the Legislature intended in \u00a7 47 to depart from the statutory principle in G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 53, that, \u201cas far as practicable,\u201d children in the juvenile justice system \u201cshall be treated, not as criminals, but as children in need of aid, encouragement, and guidance,\u201d or to deny Juvenile Court judges the discretion needed to implement this principle. Where the Legislature intends to depart from this statutory principle and mandate a condition of probation for a juvenile, we trust it will do so with more clarity than we find in \u00a7 47. Cf. <em>Riley </em>v. <em>Davis Constr. Co., </em>381 Mass. 432, 438 (1980) (statute not to be interpreted as effecting material change in common law unless intent to do so is clearly expressed).</p>\n<p id=\"b834-5\">Accordingly, we hold that mandatory GPS monitoring pursuant to \u00a7 47 does not apply to juveniles who have been adjudicated delinquent.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Of course, wholly apart from \u00a7 47, Juvenile Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"817\">*817</page-number>judges retain the discretion, in appropriate cases, to order GPS monitoring as a condition of probation. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Vallejo, 455 Mass. 72, 89-90 (2009); <em>Emelio E. </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>453 Mass. 1024, 1025 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b835-4\"><em>Conclusion. </em>The judge\u2019s finding that, under \u00a7 47, she had no discretion to relieve the juvenile from the obligation of wearing a GPS monitor was error. Were the case not moot, see note 2, <em>supra, </em>we would remand the matter to the judge for a determination whether, in her discretion, GPS monitoring should be a condition of the juvenile\u2019s probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-5\">\n<em>Appeal dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b826-6\">Our holding is limited to juveniles placed on probation as a result of being adjudicated delinquent on a complaint.

L. c. 119, \u00a7 54.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b826-7\">The juvenile has now successfully completed his probation. Although his case is moot, we exercise our discretion to hear the merits of this case because the issue is of significant public interest, fully briefed by the parties, and very likely to arise again in similar circumstances, yet evade review. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cory, </em>454 Mass. 559, 560 n.3 (2009), and cases cited; <em>Lockhart </em>v. <em>Attorney Gen., </em>390 Mass. 780, 783 (1984), and cases cited.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b828-6\">The Commonwealth contended during oral argument that the phrase \u201cif <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"811\">*811</page-number>applicable\u201d was intended to exclude juveniles from this condition. The legislative history is silent on this subject, but we believe it far more likely that the Legislature recognized that the global positioning system (GPS) monitoring required by G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 47, was not limited to those who committed a sex offense against a child, and that exclusion zones intended to minimize a probationer\u2019s contact with children may be unnecessary where the victim was not a child and the adult sex offender posed no risk to children.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b829-9\">General Laws c. 279, \u00a7 1, allows a judge to suspend the execution of a sentence of imprisonment of a \u201cperson convicted before a court,\u201d and direct that he be \u201cplaced on probation.\u201d General Laws c. 279, \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 3, were part of the same statutory enactment in 1900, see St. 1900, c. 449, \u00a7\u00a7 1-2, so we can infer that G. L. c. 279, \u00a7 3, addresses the consequence of a probation violation by a person placed on probation after being \u201cconvicted before a court.\u201d See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Connor C., </em>432 Mass. 635, 645 (2000) (\u201cAbsent some contrary indication in the statute, the same words used in different parts of a statute enacted at the same time should receive the same meaning\u201d). Accordingly, G.
