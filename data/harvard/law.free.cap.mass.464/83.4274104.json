The Appeals Court concluded that the defendant\u2019s right to a public trial was violated, reversed the denial of the defendant\u2019s motion, and vacated the judgment. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lavoie, </em>80 Mass. App. Ct. 546, 547 (2011). Because we conclude that counsel may waive a defendant\u2019s right to a public trial during jury selection without express consent and, in the circumstances here, that counsel\u2019s decision was a reasonable tactical decision, we affirm the denial of the defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-5\"><em>Facts and procedure. </em>In 2003, the defendant was convicted of murder in the second degree, and the Appeals Court affirmed the conviction in an unpublished memorandum and order issued pursuant to its rule 1:28. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lavoie, </em>67 Mass. App. Ct. 1114 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b102-6\">In 2007, in light of a decision by a Federal court, the defendant moved for a new trial, arguing that his right to a public trial under the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution was violated when court officers excluded his family from the court room during jury selection and his counsel failed to object.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The trial judge conducted an evidentiary hearing on the defendant\u2019s motion on August 28 and September 11, 2008. In his written findings of fact, rulings of law, and order, the judge found the following facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-7\">Jury selection for the 2003 trial was conducted in court room 12B in the Cambridge court house of the Middlesex division of the Superior Court Department. On the first day of jury selection, the defendant, who had requested an individual voir dire of prospective jurors, waived his right to be present at sidebar where voir dire was conducted. Before the venire were brought <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>in, court officers instructed the defendant\u2019s father, mother, and sister to leave the court room. The judge was not aware that this had happened. It appears that court officers in the Cambridge court house cleared the public from court rooms during jury selection in situations where the size of the venire would leave insufficient room for family members to sit separately from the potential jurors. The defendant knew that his relatives were leaving the court room; he was a \u201clittle upset\u201d but did not discuss the issue with his attorney. The family had a \u201cvery good\u201d relationship with the court officers, who \u201cupdated them about how the process was proceeding.\u201d Jury selection lasted two days.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b103-5\">At the motion hearing, defense counsel testified to his reasons for not objecting, which the judge implicitly credited. Defense counsel stated that it was not his usual practice to object when court officers cleared the court for jury selection because he was aware that space was often insufficient, and he did not want to interfere with \u201ccourt officers who he perceived engaged in a difficult job\u201d or to have family members sitting near potential jurors. Defense counsel also expressed his belief that family members could present a distraction and, specific to this case, stated his concern that the defendant\u2019s mother \u201cwas an emotional individual [who would] be a distraction.\u201d Although defense counsel had no specific recollection of court officers excluding the defendant\u2019s family during jury selection and did not discuss this issue with the defendant, \u201che had consciously decided prior to this trial not to object to the removal of family members or supporters during the jury selection process in courtroom 12B.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b103-6\">The judge determined that the court officers\u2019 exclusion of the defendant\u2019s family, where the jury venire was so large as to \u201coccup[y] the entirety of the public seating area of the courtroom,\u201d constituted structural error. The judge stated that even though he conducted the \u201cvast majority of the [jury selection] process outside the public\u2019s hearing\u201d (i.e., through individual voir dire), the two-day closure of the court room violated the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>defendant\u2019s Sixth Amendment rights, which were not waived.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The judge also noted that, in accordance with <em>Owens </em>v. <em>United States, </em>483 F.3d 48 (1st Cir. 2007), he would have allowed family members in the court room \u201conce prospective jurors began to leave\u201d and the need for the exclusion \u201cdissipated.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b104-8\">However, the judge also reasoned that because the defendant had not raised any issue concerning the denial of his right to a public trial until this new trial motion, the issue to be decided was whether justice had been done. See Mass. R. Crim. R 30 (b), as appearing in 435 Mass. 1501 (2001). The judge concluded that there was no miscarriage of justice because closing court room 12B during jury selection did not materially impact the case or verdict and that defense counsel\u2019s failure to object to the closure was a reasonable tactical decision.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> He denied the defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial. The defendant appealed. A divided Appeals Court concluded that the defendant\u2019s right to a public trial had been violated. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lavoie, supra </em>at 547.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-20\"><em>Discussion. A </em>defendant has a constitutional right to a public trial, which includes the jury selection process. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cohen (No. 1), </em>456 Mass. 94, 106 (2010), citing <em>Presley </em>v. <em>Georgia, </em>558 U.S. 209, 211-212 (2010) (right to public trial granted by First and Sixth Amendments to United States Constitution). The right to an open court in criminal proceedings is \u201can effective restraint on possible abuse of judicial power,\u201d <em>In re Oliver, </em>333 U.S. 257, 270 (1948), which fu\u00f1e-tions for \u201cthe benefit of the accused; that the public may see he is fairly dealt with and not unjustly condemned.\u201d <em>Waller </em>v. <em>Georgia, </em>467 U.S. 39, 46 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b104-31\">Conducting jury selection in open court permits members of the public to observe trial proceedings and promotes fairness in the judicial system. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cohen (No. 1), supra </em>at 106, citing <em>Press-Enterprise Co. </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>464 U.S. 501, 508 (1984). However, the right to a public trial is not absolute; a judge may permit closure of a court room if the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>closure satisfies the necessary requirements. <em>Waller </em>v. <em>Georgia, supra </em>at 44-45, citing <em>Globe Newspaper Co. </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>457 U.S. 596 (1982).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b105-5\">The parties do not dispute the judge\u2019s findings that court room 12B of the Superior Court was closed for two days during jury selection,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> or his determination that defense counsel\u2019s lack of objection during jury selection was a tactical decision.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Instead, they argue whether counsel effectively waived the defendant\u2019s right to a public trial.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b105-6\">As the United States Supreme Court has noted, \u201c[f]or certain fundamental rights, the defendant must personally make an informed waiver. For other rights, however, waiver may be effected by action of counsel.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>Gonzalez </em>v. <em>United States, </em>553 U.S. 242, 248 (2008), quoting <em>New York </em>v. <em>Hill, </em>528 U.S. 110, 113-114 (2000). A requirement of the defendant\u2019s express personal and knowing waiver preserves the basic rights of the accused and raises considerations of the trial process, such as counsel\u2019s \u201cfull authority to manage the conduct of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>trial.\u201d <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>Illinois, </em>484 U.S. 400, 418 (1988). See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Gonzalez-Lopez, </em>548 U.S. 140, 152 (2006) (trial court has latitude to balance Sixth Amendment right to counsel with needs of fairness and efficiency of trial process). Counsel is best equipped to make \u201c[n]umerous choices affecting conduct of the trial, including the objections to make, the witnesses to call, and the arguments to advance.\u201d <em>Gonzalez </em>v. <em>United States, supra </em>at 249. These choices, which depend \u201cupon tactical considerations of the moment and the larger strategic plan for the trial,\u201d promote a fair trial process. <em>Id. </em>(where counsel gives express consent, magistrate judge may preside over jury selection process in felony criminal trial).</p>\n<p id=\"b106-5\">The defendant argues that the judge was correct to conclude that the defendant had not waived his right to a public trial because \u201cthere was no explicit waiver by the defendant or his attorney, and . . . defense counsel could not waive his client\u2019s rights without ever discussing the issue of his right to a public trial with him.\u201d The defendant further states that a waiver of this right could not have occurred where he did not know he had such a right or understand that his counsel made a decision concerning that right. The Commonwealth argues that counsel may waive the defendant\u2019s right to a public trial without the defendant\u2019s personal consent, and asserts that where a defendant has waived a right, no constitutional violation has occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-6\">Although the Appeals Court has stated that the right to a public trial can be waived only with a defendant\u2019s consent, this is a question of first impression in this court.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Previously, we have concluded that the right to a public trial may be waived \u201cthrough [the defendant\u2019s] actions or the actions of his counsel.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Williams, 379 </em>Mass. 874, 876 (1980) (case remanded to determine whether defendant waived right to public trial). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dyer, </em>460 Mass. 728, 736 (2011), cert, denied, 132 S. Ct. 2693 (2012) (right may be waived without formal colloquy); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Horton, </em>434 Mass. 823, 831 (2001). We now conclude that counsel may waive, with or without the defendant\u2019s express consent, the right to a public <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>trial during jury selection where the waiver is a tactical decision as part of counsel\u2019s trial strategy.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b107-5\">Here, the defendant, through his counsel, waived his right to a public trial during jury selection. This tactical decision is in defense counsel\u2019s purview to manage the conduct of the trial. See <em>Gonzalez </em>v. <em>United States, supra </em>at 249-250; <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>Illinois, supra </em>at 418 (\u201cThe adversary process could not function effectively if every tactical decision required client approval\u201d). The issue is whether that waiver constituted ineffective assistance.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-6\">The standard of review for unpreserved errors in noncapital murder cases is whether there was a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Freeman, </em>352 Mass. 556, 564 (1967).* <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> \u201c[Wjhen the claim of ineffectiveness is predicated . . . on counsel\u2019s failure to object to something that occurred at trial,\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Azar, </em>435 Mass. 675, 686 (2002), we use the ineffectiveness of counsel standard set forth in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Saferian, </em>366 Mass. 89, 96 (1974), because, \u201cwhether we view the unpreserved claim of error . . . [by] utilizing the substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice standard, or ... by focusing on counsel\u2019s ineffectiveness in failing to object to the error, our approach is essentially the same, and . . . the result would be the same.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Azar, supra </em>at 686-687.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-7\">Counsel is ineffective where his conduct falls \u201cbelow that which might be expected from an ordinary fallible lawyer\u201d and prejudices the defendant by depriving him \u201cof an otherwise available, substantial ground of defence.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Saferian, supra. </em>We look to the reasonableness of the decision <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>at the time it was made. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Burgos, </em>462 Mass. 53, 70, cert, denied, 133 S. Ct. 796 (2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b108-5\">The defendant agrees that the standard for ineffective counsel set forth in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Saferian, supra, </em>applies. However, he asserts, in essence, that he is entitled to a new trial because the denial of his right to a public trial was structural error, and he claims that the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit held that \u201ca defendant who is seeking to excuse a procedurally defaulted claim of structural error need not establish actual prejudice.\u201d See <em>Owens </em>v. <em>United States, </em>483 F.3d 48, 64 (1st Cir. 2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b108-6\">The defendant confuses the nature of the prejudice discussed in the <em>Owens </em>case. In that case, the issue of court room closure also was not objected to at trial or raised in the defendant\u2019s direct appeal, but raised in a motion for postconviction relief. However, the procedural similarity between that case and the one here ends at this point.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-7\">In the <em>Owens </em>case, the trial judge would not conduct an evi-dentiary hearing on Owens\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel claim because Owens did not satisfy the test for procedural default, where a defendant must show cause and actual prejudice. <em>Id. </em>at 61. See <em>Owens </em>v. <em>United States, 236 </em>F. Supp. 2d 122, 132 (D. Mass. 2002). On appeal, the court held that, because court room closure was a structural error, it would presume prejudice within the test for procedural default and remand for an eviden-tiary hearing on ineffective assistance of counsel. <em>Owens </em>v. <em>United States, </em>483 F.3d at 64. The procedural posture in this case is that while the defendant did not waive his right to a public trial, he already has had an evidentiary hearing, the result of which he now appeals. Here, the record supports the judge\u2019s finding that defense counsel provided a clear explanation of his practice of not objecting to the exclusion of family members or supporters of his clients in the court room during jury selection, including his concerns regarding family members sitting near potential jurors, the court officers\u2019 responsibilities, and the risk that family members could be a distraction. Moreover, he made a specific decision not to object at the defendant\u2019s trial.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AS1\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>Given these facts, we agree with the judge that defense counsel\u2019s tactical decision not to object to the courtroom closure in the Superior Court was not manifestly unreasonable when made and, thus, the defendant was not deprived of effective assistance of counsel.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"A7e\">\n<em>Order denying motion for a new trial affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b102-8\">The record is not clear, but the case was either <em>Owens </em>v. <em>United States, </em>483 F.3d 48, 66 (1st Cir. 2007) (trial judge abused discretion in not holding evidentiary hearing concerning possible court room closure), or <em>Owens </em>v. <em>United States, </em>517 F.

See, e.g., <em>Owens </em>v. <em>United States, </em>517 F.

A waiver of a right \u201cinvolves the intentional relinquishment of a known right, or such conduct as warrants an inference of the relinquishment of such right.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 1580 (6th ed. 1990). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Alphas, </em>430 Mass. 8, 22 n.l (1999) (Greaney, J., concurring). The parties\u2019 first argument concerns waiver of a right.
