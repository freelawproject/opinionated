In an unpublished memorandum and order issued pursuant to its rule 1:28, the Appeals Court affirmed. <em>J.E.S. </em>v. <em>L.J.S., </em>79 Mass. App. Ct. 1117 (2011). Because we conclude that, if presented with evidence of potential tax consequences, a judge should consider those consequences when creating or modifying alimony <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>provisions in a divorce instrument, we vacate the order on the husband\u2019s motion to alter or amend the divorce judgment to the extent that the judge did not consider the uncertainty of potentially unfair tax consequences, and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-5\"><em>Statutory scheme. </em>Under I.R.C. \u00a7 71(c)(2) of the Internal Revenue Code, alimony payments may be recharacterized as child support for Federal tax purposes:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b365-6\">\u201c[I]f any amount specified in the [divorce] instrument will be reduced \u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b365-7\">\u201c(A) on the happening of a contingency specified in the instrument relating to a child (such as attaining a specified age, marrying, dying, leaving school, or a similar contingency), or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b365-8\">\u201c(B) at a time which can clearly be associated with a contingency of a kind specified in subparagraph (A),</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b365-9\">an amount equal to the amount of such reduction will be treated as an amount fixed as payable for the support of children of the payor spouse.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b365-10\">Regulations promulgated pursuant to I.R.C. \u00a7 71(c)(2) state that support payments, even if otherwise determined to be alimony, will be characterized as child support (1) if they are reduced within six months before or after a child attains the age of eighteen, twenty-one, or the local age of majority; or (2) if payments are reduced twice or more within one year before or after a child reaches any age between eighteen and twenty-four. Treas. Reg. \u00a7 1.71-lT(c), Q &amp; A (18) (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b365-11\">In addition to the examples of child-related events constituting a specific contingency set out in the statute, the regulations offer examples of contingencies, such as a child attaining a specified income level or gaining employment. Treas. Reg. \u00a7 1.71-lT(c), Q &amp; A (17) (1984). The regulations also state that \u201ca contingency relates to a child of the payor if it depends on any event relating to that child, regardless of whether such event is certain or likely to occur.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b365-12\">Tax consequences arise under these provisions because a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>payor may deduct alimony, but not child support.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> I.R.C. \u00a7 71(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b366-4\"><em>Facts and procedure. </em>The husband and the wife sought a divorce on the ground of irretrievable breakdown of marriage in 2007. The judge issued a judgment of divorce nisi on November 17, 2009. The relevant sections of the divorce judgment, as stated in the judgment and a corrected order of clarification, are the following.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-5\">The husband will pay $1,000 each week as child support and $1,325 each week as alimony. The wife will occupy the home, and pay the mortgage on it, as well as certain related expenses, \u201cuntil the youngest child of the parents graduates from High School, anticipated to be in June 2013. At such time the parties shall place the marital home ... on the market for sale.\u201d After the house is sold, the husband\u2019s alimony obligation will be reduced to $500 each week and will continue until the death of either party or until the remarriage of the wife.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-6\">Based on the language of I.R.C. \u00a7 71(c)(2), the husband moved to alter or amend the divorce judgment on November 24, 2009, requesting, among other things, that the judgment reflect that a future reduction in alimony would not depend on a child-related event. He requested that the wife continue to have the use and occupancy of the marital house until August 1, 2013, rather than \u201cuntil the youngest child of the parents graduates from High School, anticipated to be June 2013.\u201d He also proposed May 1, 2013, as the date the house be put up for sale with the provision that no sale should take place before August 1, 2013. Additionally, he proposed that alimony be reduced to $500 each week as of September 1, 2013, after the house was on the market for sale for four months. With these alterations to the judgment, the husband asserted that he would avoid the pos<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>sibility of having to pay taxes on the alimony as if it were child support under I.R.C. \u00a7 71(c)(2). At the hearing on the motion, the judge addressed the alimony provisions in the divorce judgment. He stated that the provisions concerning alimony were based on the ability of the husband, the \u201cmajor income producer,\u201d to pay, and the need of the wife. He also stated that the wife\u2019s financial needs will change after the house is sold at some uncertain future date, and that he intentionally did not include a date for reduction of alimony because \u201cwe don\u2019t know when the marital house is going to be sold.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b367-5\">The judge stated that he wanted to be \u201cfair and equitable\u201d and ordered the house to be put on the market, with \u201csomething triggering] it off.\u201d He acknowledged that the house might not sell immediately, explaining that he \u201canticipated there will be equity in the home when it\u2019s up for sale, and this will be some of the equity that [the wife] will then have to work with, which triggers off to a great degree why alimony is then reduced.\u201d He further stated his intent to reduce alimony after the sale of the marital home: \u201cSo that it\u2019s the graduation from high school and then it\u2019s the sale of the house, and it\u2019s left in that particular fashion for that purpose.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b367-6\">Regarding the issue of alimony and tax consequences, the judge told the parties that I.R.C. \u00a7 71(c)(2) did not apply: \u201c[Y]ou talk about the Internal Revenue Code and the interpretation of the Internal Revenue Code, and I don\u2019t necessarily interpret it that way. I think it\u2019s factually driven.\u201d The judge also explained his considerations of the tax consequences of alimony, stating, \u201c[Tjhat\u2019s why the alimony is higher, giving [the husband] the tax advantage now ... so that\u2019s geared intentionally in that fashion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b367-7\">The judge issued an order on the motion to alter and amend the judgment of divorce on December 4, 2009, which did not include the husband\u2019s proposals concerning reduction in alimony. The husband appealed. The Appeals Court concluded that I.R.C. \u00a7 71(c)(2) does not apply to this alimony provision and affirmed the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-8\"><em>Discussion. A </em>judge has broad discretion in creating an equitable division of the parties\u2019 marital property. <em>Kittredge </em>v. <em>Kit-tredge, </em>441 Mass. 28, 43-44 (2004). Alimony may be granted to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>either spouse based on a weighing of all relevant circumstances. <em>Schuler </em>v. <em>Schuler, </em>382 Mass. 366, 370 (1981). We rarely disturb a judge\u2019s conclusions where they are based on consideration of the factors listed in G. L. c. 208, \u00a7 34. <em>Kittredge </em>v. <em>Kittredge, supra </em>at 43-45 (judge\u2019s determination affirmed where findings demonstrated consideration of all required factors, and conclusions flowed rationally from findings and rulings). See <em>Bianco </em>v. <em>Bianco, </em>371 Mass. 420, 423 (1976) (in case of first impression, we interpreted G. L. c. 208, \u00a7 34, to define scope of judge\u2019s discretion).</p>\n<p id=\"b368-5\">The wife asserts that the judge\u2019s ruling was proper because it reflected the husband\u2019s ability to pay and her need for support. See <em>Gottsegen </em>v. <em>Gottsegen, </em>397 Mass. 617, 624 (1986). She does not directly address I.R.C. \u00a7 71(c)(2), but instead argues that the judge considered the factors listed in G. L. c. 208, \u00a7 34, and properly assigned alimony obligations.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Because the reduction in alimony will occur only after the sale of the marital home, she argues, the change in alimony reflects \u201ca reduction in her expenses rather than the child graduating [from] high school.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b368-8\">The husband bases his argument on the premise that a judge must consider tax consequences when adjudicating divorce judgments. We agree that, in the context of fashioning divorce judgments or modifications of such judgments, where the issue of tax consequences has been raised and the judge has been provided with \u201cappropriate evidence in the record,\u201d <em>Wolfe </em>v. <em>Wolfe, </em>21 Mass. App. Ct. 254, 258 n.7 (1985), the judge should consider the tax consequences arising from a judgment.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> See <em>Fechtor </em>v. <em>Fechtor, </em>26 Mass. App. Ct. 859, 866 (1989). In some <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>circumstances, tax consequence issues may be raised during trial; in others, the issues may be more appropriately raised in a postjudgment motion to amend the judgment under Mass. R. Dom. Rel. R 59 (e), or for relief under Mass. R. Dom. Rel. P. 60 (b). See <em>Fechtor </em>v. <em>Fechtor, supra </em>at 867 &amp; n.7 (\u201cWhen tax consequences seem likely to present significant problems, the judge can perhaps deal with them by issuing a tentative order submitted to counsel in advance of judgment for criticism and suggestions\u201d). Here, the husband filed a postjudgment motion specifically requesting that the judge consider the potential adverse tax consequences of the alimony and support order, providing citations to the tax code and other relevant authorities.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-5\">As the Appeals Court stated in <em>Wolfe </em>v. <em>Wolfe, supra, </em>\u201cthe importance of consideration of the tax consequences of divorce and of the division of property and payments incident thereto\u201d has long been recognized by our appellate courts. The Massachusetts Child Support Guidelines (effective Jan. 1, 2009) (2009 guidelines) similarly recognize the importance of taking tax consequences into account when devising support orders. For example, the 2009 guidelines provide that the \u201cguidelines do not preclude the Court from deciding that any order be designated in whole or in part as alimony without it being deemed a deviation provided the tax consequences are considered in determining the order and the after-tax support received by the recipient. It is the responsibility of the parties to present the tax consequences of proposed orders to the Court.\u201d 2009 guidelines, II.A. See <em>Rice </em>v. <em>Rice, </em>372 Mass. 398, 402 n.4 (1977); <em>Fechtor </em>v. <em>Fechtor, supra </em>at 866.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-6\">Our conclusion that a judge should consider the tax consequences of a judgment when creating or modifying divorce instruments comports with the statutory mandate to consider the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>parties\u2019 income and liabilities. General Laws c. 208, \u00a7 34, mandates that when determining the amount of alimony to be paid, a judge must consider the income and liabilities of each party, and G. L. c. 208, \u00a7 53 <em>(b), </em>which limits alimony to the recipient\u2019s need or to thirty to thirty-five per cent of the difference between the parties\u2019 gross incomes at the time of the judgment, states that gross income shall be defined as set forth in the child support guidelines: \u201cgross income from whatever source regardless of whether that income is recognized by the Internal Revenue Code or reported to the Internal Revenue Service or state Department of Revenue or other taxing authority.\u201d 2009 guidelines, I.A. Our conclusion should not be taken to mean the judge must minimize tax consequences as a result of those considerations. The judge has \u201cconsiderable discretion\u201d to make those determinations. <em>Pierce </em>v. Pierce, 455 Mass. 286, 293 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b370-5\">The judgment in this case delineated a two-step process in the reduction of alimony: that the husband\u2019s reduction of alimony be reduced on the sale of the marital home; and that the marital home be put on the market for sale when the youngest child graduates from high school. The husband argues that the divorce judgment was written such that the reduction in alimony payments to the wife, which are excludable from his taxable income, will be construed under I.R.C. \u00a7 71(c)(2) as nondeductible child support because the marital home will be put up for sale on a date based on a contingency of his child. The statute applies, he claims, because the payment of alimony is reduced on the \u201chappening\u201d of a contingency related to a child, or at a time that can clearly be associated with such a contingency.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b370-6\">However, it is uncertain whether the Internal Revenue Service or the United States Tax Court would determine from this judgment that alimony payments should be recharacterized as child support payments pursuant to I.R.C. \u00a7 71(c)(2). No party has cited, and we have not found, any case from the Tax Court that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>addresses the specific facts presented in this case, and those cases that have addressed comparable circumstances leave us uncertain whether the Tax Court would conclude that these circumstances would cause such a recharacterization.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Where, as here, the tax consequences are uncertain, the judge must take that uncertainty into account and consider whether there are alternatives that will accomplish the judge\u2019s purposes but avoid the potential that his decision will trigger adverse and unwanted tax consequences.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-5\">Here, the judge made findings that supported his reasons for alimony payments based on his consideration of the relevant factors of G. L. c. 208, \u00a7 34, including the husband\u2019s ability to pay alimony and the wife\u2019s capacity to pay the mortgage and related expenses. It appears from the record that the judge intended that alimony be paid to the wife in accordance with her needs, which will change after the sale of the marital home, and that, once the marital home is sold, the wife will no longer need the same amount of alimony. Given our conclusion, a judge, in his or her discretion, should consider the possible application of I.R.C. \u00a7 71(c)(2), and explore whether the objectives of the judgment can be met in a manner that does not create an uncertainty of potentially unfair tax consequences.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-6\"><em>Conclusion. </em>The order on the husband\u2019s motion to alter or amend the divorce judgment is vacated to the extent that the judge did not consider the uncertainty of potentially unfair tax <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>consequences. An order is to enter remanding the case to the Probate and Family Court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-4\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b366-7\">Alimony payments are intended for the support of a spouse and are deductible from the payor\u2019s taxable income. I.R.C. \u00a7\u00a7 71(b)(1), 215 (2006). Child support payments are fixed by the divorce instrument as payable for the support of the children of the payor spouse and are not deductible from the pay- or\u2019s income. I.R.C. \u00a7 71(c)(1). However, \u201c[i]t is well settled that the [Tax Court\u2019s] determination of whether payments are in the nature of support or part of a property settlement does not turn on the labels assigned to the payments by the court in the divorce decree or by the parties in their agreement.\u201d <em>Beard </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 77 </em>T.C. 1275, 1283-1284 (1981).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b368-10\">General Laws c. 208, \u00a7 34, states, in pertinent part, that when determining alimony or assignment of estate, the judge shall consider the following factors: \u201cthe length of the marriage, the conduct of the parties during the marriage, the age, health, station, occupation, amount and sources of income, vocational skills, employability, estate, liabilities and needs of each of the parties, the opportunity of each for future acquisition of capital assets and income, ... the amount and duration of alimony, [and] the present and future needs of the dependent children of the marriage.\u201d The judge \u201cmay also consider the contribution of each of the parties in the acquisition, preservation or appreciation in value of their respective estates and the contribution of each of the parties as a homemaker to the family unit.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b368-12\">We have previously discussed tax consequences in divorce or separation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>agreements where judges are valuing assets or obligations. See, e.g., <em>Adams </em>v. <em>Adams, </em>459 Mass. 361, 389 (2011) (valuation of partnership); <em>Bernier </em>v. <em>Bernier, </em>449 Mass. 774, 781-790 (2007) (tax affecting valuations of C corporations and S corporations); <em>Kittredge </em>v. <em>Kittredge, </em>441 Mass. 28, 31 (2004) (valuations of business entities); <em>Silverman </em>v. <em>Spiro, </em>438 Mass. 725, 731 (2003) (liquidation of retirement assets); <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Massa, </em>431 Mass. 619, 629-630 (2000) (valuation of real estate interests); <em>deCastro </em>v. <em>deCastro, </em>415 Mass. 787, 796 n.8 (1993) (transfer of stock); <em>Abrams </em>v. <em>Burg, </em>367 Mass. 617, 622 (1975) (payments not intended to be taxable to payee).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b370-7\">The husband also argues that the child may be considered emancipated, pursuant to the language of G. L. c. 208, \u00a7 28, at the time of the sale of the home, and that emancipation is a child-related contingency. Given our conclusion, we decline to decide whether the youngest child of the husband and wife would be emancipated within the context of the divorce judgment and I.R.C. \u00a7 71(c)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b371-7\">Some cases from the United States Tax Court demonstrate that, if a reduction or elimination of alimony occurs \u201cdue to the happening of a contingency relating to a child,\u201d such as a child reaching a certain age, that \u201chappening\u201d will trigger a recharacterization of support payments from alimony to child support. See, e.g., <em>Hammond </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Internal Revenue, </em>75 T.C.M. (CCH) 1745, 1747 (1998) (reduction of alimony tied to child\u2019s eighteenth birthday); <em>Fosberg </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Internal Revenue, </em>64 T.C.M. (CCH) 1527, 1529 (1992). Other cases, however, hold that, unless the child-related contingency is clearly associated with the reduction in alimony, there will be no recharacterization. See, e.g., <em>Schilling </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Internal Revenue, </em>104 T.C.M. (CCH) 272 (2012) (cessation of payments after six years did not qualify as contingency relating to child); <em>Shepherd </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Internal Revenue, </em>79 T.C.M. (CCH) 2078, 2080-2081 (2000) (coincidence that alimony ceased within six months of child\u2019s eighteenth birthday). See also <em>Lawton </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Internal Revenue, </em>78 T.C.M. (CCH) 153, 156 (1992) (where no child-related contingency exists in support orders, support payments are characterized as alimony).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
