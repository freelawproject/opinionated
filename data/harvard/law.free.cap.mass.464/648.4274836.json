L. c. 269, \u00a7 10 <em>{a), </em>based on a theory of constructive possession. On appeal, he asserts that the Commonwealth failed to present evidence sufficient to establish as a matter of law that he had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>(1) knowledge of the firearm\u2019s presence in his vehicle, (2) the ability to exercise control over the weapon, and (3) the intent to do so. He also argues that the evidence on these points is susceptible to \u201cequal and inconsistent\u201d inferences and choosing between them amounts to impermissible conjecture. Additionally, the defendant contends that it was error to permit the investigating police officer to testify about the defendant\u2019s extrajudicial statements made at the time of his arrest, because they were not relevant to any element of the charged offense and introduced collateral issues that confused the jury. Finally, the defendant avers that the Commonwealth\u2019s reliance on a ballistics certificate, in order to prove the weapon was a \u201cfirearm\u201d as defined by G. L. c. 140, \u00a7 121, without making the ballisti-cian available for cross-examination was testimonial hearsay and violated the defendant\u2019s right to confrontation under the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution. On appeal, a divided panel of the Appeals Court affirmed. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Romero, </em>80 Mass. App. Ct. 791 (2011) <em>(Romero). </em>We granted the defendant\u2019s application for further appellate review.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b667-5\">We conclude at the outset that the trial judge did not err in admitting the defendant\u2019s extrajudicial statements. We further conclude that although the evidence proffered by the Commonwealth was adequate to establish that the defendant knew the firearm was present in the motor vehicle he was operating and that he had the ability to exercise control over the weapon, the evidence was insufficient to prove he had the requisite intention to control the firearm. Consequently, the defendant is entitled to a directed verdict of not guilty.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b667-6\">1. <em>Background. </em>The jury could have found the following facts. On April 23, 2008, just after 4:30 p.m., the defendant drove to his girl friend\u2019s house on Chestnut Street in Waltham to pick her up for a night out. While he waited outside, her brother, Eduardo Alvarez, approached the defendant\u2019s vehicle and showed him his firearm. The defendant looked at the firearm, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number>touched it, and gave it back to Alvarez. When his girl friend came out of the house, the two of them left in the defendant\u2019s motor vehicle. When they returned, later that evening, Alvarez and his brothers were outside, and they asked if they could go for a ride in the defendant\u2019s new vehicle. The defendant agreed and proceeded to drive them around for a short period of time but soon returned to the house, at which point they remained in the now parked vehicle listening to music.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-5\">Meanwhile, Officer Dennis M. Deveney, Jr., of the Waltham police department was patrolling in the area. At approximately 1:30 a.m., his attention was drawn to the defendant\u2019s motor vehicle, a two-door sports coupe, parked on a dimly lit section of Chestnut Street. As Deveney drove past the vehicle, he observed several individuals sitting inside, but due to the way the occupants were sitting, he could only see the \u201ctops of their torso[s] and their heads.\u201d Deveney also noticed that the interior dome light turned off as he passed. This observation prompted Deveney to return to Chestnut Street, where he parked his cruiser thirty feet behind the defendant\u2019s vehicle so that he could make further observations.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-6\">Deveney began to walk down Chestnut Street, stopping three to five feet behind the vehicle. He waited for about one minute, trying to determine what the occupants were doing. The front passenger\u2019s side window was open and Deveney heard music playing. He watched as the occupant sitting behind the driver reached toward the front seat. He also observed the defendant, who was sitting in the driver\u2019s seat, look from side to side, while Alvarez, who was sitting in the front passenger seat, examined an object in his hand. Based on these observations, Deveney shone his flashlight into the vehicle and asked the occupants, \u201cWhat\u2019s going on guys?\u201d Looking panicked, Alvarez turned toward Deveney and immediately dropped the object he was holding into his lap. Deveney directed his flashlight to the object and saw that it was a black handgun, at which point he called for backup and awaited its arrival before removing the occupants from the vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-7\">Soon thereafter, Deveney read the defendant the Miranda warnings, and the defendant agreed to speak with him. During their conversation, the defendant acknowledged that he knew <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>Alvarez owned a firearm, but that he was unaware that Alvarez had it with him in the vehicle or that it was being passed around. The defendant also told Deveney that Alvarez had shown him a firearm earlier that day and that he had handled the weapon. Following this conversation, Deveney placed the defendant under arrest. The unloaded firearm was then sent to the State police crime laboratory to determine whether it was operable. After testing, the firearm was returned to the Waltham police department along with one spent bullet casing and a ballistics report confirming that the firearm was functional.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-4\">2. <em>Discussion, </em>a. <em>Admissibility of the defendant\u2019s out-of-court statement. </em>Because it is relevant to our later analysis, we first consider whether the judge correctly admitted in evidence the defendant\u2019s statement to Deveney that Alvarez showed him a gun earlier in the day. The defendant argues that this statement is inadmissible because it is (1) hearsay, (2) irrelevant to any material issue, and (3) overly prejudicial. The Commonwealth responds that the statement is admissible as circumstantial evidence that the defendant knew the firearm was in his vehicle as well as for its truth as an admission of a party opponent. We agree with the Commonwealth.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-5\">Hearsay is an out-of-court statement offered by a witness at trial or hearing to prove the truth of the matter asserted. Mass. G. Evid. \u00a7 801(c) (2012). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Marshall, </em>434 Mass. 358, 365-366 (2001). Here, however, the out-of-court statements at issue were uttered by the defendant and qualify as admissions of a party opponent<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> pertinent to his knowledge of Alvarez\u2019s possession of a firearm earlier in the day and, as a possible result, his awareness of its presence in the vehicle at the time of his arrest.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Consequently, the defendant\u2019s statement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>is not hearsay and is admissible for its truth. Mass. G. Evid. \u00a7 801(d)(2)(A) (2012).* ***<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> There was no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-5\">b. <em>Sufficiency of the evidence. </em>In reviewing the sufficiency of the evidence, we determine \u201cwhether, after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, <em>any </em>rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt\u201d (emphasis in original). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Latimore, </em>378 Mass. 671, 677 (1979), quoting <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Virginia, </em>443 U.S. 307, 318-329 (1979). General Laws c. 269, \u00a7 10 (a), provides: \u201cWhoever . . . knowingly has in his possession; or knowingly has under his control in a vehicle; a firearm, loaded or unloaded . . . without ... (2) having in effect a license to carry firearms issued under [G. L. c. 140, \u00a7 131] . . . shall be punished by imprisonment in the state prison . . . .\u201d In order to sustain a conviction, the Commonwealth must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant \u201cactually or constructively possessed the firearm,\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hubbard, </em>69 Mass. App. Ct. 232, 237 (2007), and that he did so knowingly. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gouse, </em>461 Mass. 787, 795 (2012).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>\u2019<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b671-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>Because the firearm was not found on the defendant\u2019s person, we must determine whether there was sufficient evidence to support the Commonwealth\u2019s theory of constructive possession. Proof of constructive possession requires the Commonwealth to show \u201cknowledge coupled with the ability and intention to exercise dominion and control.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Brzezinski, </em>405 Mass. 401, 409 (1989) (Brzezinski), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rosa, </em>17 Mass. App. Ct. 495, 498 (1984). \u201cProof of possession of [contraband] may be established by circumstantial evidence, and the inferences that can be drawn therefrom.\u201d <em>Brzezinski, supra, </em>quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>LaPerle, </em>19 Mass. App. Ct. 424, 426 (1985). However, \u201c[presence alone cannot show the requisite knowledge, power, or intention to exercise control over [contraband], but presence, supplemented by other incriminating evidence, \u2018will serve to tip the scale in favor of sufficiency.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Albano, </em>373 Mass. 132, 134 (1977) <em>(Albano), </em>quoting <em>United States </em>v. <em>Birmley, </em>529 F.2d 103, 108 (6th Cir. 1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b671-5\">We begin by considering whether the defendant knew that the firearm was in his vehicle. In making its case, the Commonwealth principally relies on the facts that the defendant held title to the vehicle and that the weapon was in plain view. By contrast, the defendant argues that, due to its small size, the firearm was not in plain view and that the defendant\u2019s statement to Deveney did not support an inference that he was aware of the weapon\u2019s presence.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-6\">We agree with the Appeals Court that the evidence was sufficient to support the inference that the defendant knew of the firearm. Although the defendant\u2019s knowledge of the firearm could not be proved based solely on the fact that he and the firearm were in the same vehicle, see <em>Albano, supra, </em>the fact that Alvarez was openly handling the firearm in the front passenger seat, a position immediately adjacent to the defendant, see <em>id. </em>at 135, makes it is reasonable to infer that the defendant knew of the firearm\u2019s presence. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gonzalez, </em>452 Mass. 142, 147 (2008) (presence of three small packets of cocaine as well as larger quantities of heroin and cocaine in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>loosely covered bucket supported inference that defendant knew of drugs because they were plainly visible prior to police entering apartment). This inference was strengthened by the defendant\u2019s admission to Deveney that Alvarez had shown him (and let him handle) a firearm earlier in the day.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-5\">We turn next to the defendant\u2019s ability to control the weapon. The Commonwealth argues that the defendant\u2019s proximity to the firearm inside his own vehicle, coupled with the defendant\u2019s behavior, suggests an ability to control the weapon. The defendant counters by urging that the distance of twelve to eighteen inches between the defendant and Alvarez was enough to preclude an ability to control the firearm. On this point, the Appeals Court concluded that an \u201cowner or operator of a motor vehicle, who has knowledge of the presence of a firearm, <em>unquestionably </em>has the ability to exercise dominion and control over that firearm\u201d (emphasis added). <em>Romero, supra </em>at 796.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-6\">Although we agree that the evidence was sufficient to support the inference that the defendant had the ability to exercise control over the firearm, we do not adopt the Appeals Court\u2019s overly expansive rule. There are certainly instances where one\u2019s ability to control a firearm does not follow \u201cunquestionably\u201d from one\u2019s ownership or operation of a vehicle. We need not speculate on what those situations might be, however, because in this case the defendant\u2019s proximity to the firearm, coupled with Alvarez\u2019s willingness to let him handle the weapon earlier in the day, are sufficient to support the inference that the defendant had the ability to exercise control over the firearm. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Frongillo (No. 1), </em>66 Mass. App. Ct. 677, 683-684 (2006); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Delarosa, </em>50 Mass. App. Ct. 623, 625-626, 628 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b672-7\">This brings us to the determinative issue whether the evidence was sufficient to establish that the defendant intended to exercise \u201cdominion and control\u201d over the firearm. See <em>Brzezinski, supra, </em>quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rosa, supra. </em>We reiterate that, without more, presence alone is insufficient to establish an intention to exercise control. <em>Albano, supra. </em>Rather, the defendant\u2019s presence in the vehicle must be augmented by additional inculpa-tory evidence. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b672-8\">The Appeals Court isolated several \u201cplus factors\u201d that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>\u201c[tipped] the scale in favor of sufficiency.\u201d <em>Id., </em>quoting <em>United States </em>v. <em>Birmley, supra. </em>It principally relied on the fact that the defendant was the owner and operator of the vehicle in which the firearm was found. <em>Romero, supra. </em>The court reasoned that, where an \u201cowner and operator of the car chooses not to exclude a passenger who he knows has a weapon, it is a reasonable inference that the owner and operator also has the intent to exercise dominion and control over the firearm as he does over the car itself.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Appeals Court further cited the proximity of the firearm to the defendant in conjunction with the firearm\u2019s conspicuity as supporting an inference that the weapon was being passed around the vehicle. <em>Id. </em>at 796-797. Finally, the Appeals Court focused on the circumstances of the encounter: It was 1:30 a.m., the vehicle was parked on a dimly lit street, all four occupants were \u201cslouched\u201d down in their seats, the dome light was extinguished when the police cruiser went past, and Deveney observed the firearm being passed from the rear passenger to Alvarez in the front passenger seat. <em>Id. </em>at 797. From these facts the Appeals Court concluded that the occupants were attempting to conceal \u201csurreptitious criminal activity.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 798.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-5\">We begin with the weight given to the defendant\u2019s ownership of the vehicle. We have never squarely addressed how one\u2019s proprietary interest relates to that individual\u2019s intent to exercise control over contraband. However, a review of our leading cases reveals an unstated requirement that for one\u2019s ownership interest to have significance in this regard there must be additional incriminatory evidence that links that interest to the particular contraband at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-6\">In <em>Brzezinski, supra </em>at 410, we noted: \u201cNot only was the defendant present in the apartment at the time the contraband was found, but the apartment was <em>rented </em>to him and his girl friend\u201d (emphasis added). However, our analysis did not stop there. We went on to cite additional evidence that connected his proprietary interest to the drugs, such as \u201c$450 inside the defendant\u2019s underwear . . . $100 in his pants pocket ... a triple beam scale . . . test tubes used for testing the quality of cocaine, tubes used for snorting cocaine, devices used to sift cocaine, and books on cocaine.\u201d <em>Id. </em>These additional indicia of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>criminal activity provided a link between the defendant\u2019s rental of the apartment and the drags. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Escalera, </em>462 Mass. 636, 649-650 (2012) (defendant\u2019s proprietary interest in apartment supplemented by additional evidence connecting him to drags found in basement); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pratt, </em>407 Mass. 647, 652 (1990) (sufficient evidence to support inference that defendant intended to exercise dominion over narcotics found in home where defendant was only person occupying residence at time of arrest, and variety of incriminatory drags and related paraphernalia were found amidst her personal belongings).</p>\n<p id=\"b674-5\">By contrast, in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sespedes, </em>442 Mass. 95, 100-102 (2004), we reversed the denial of the defendant\u2019s motion for required findings of not guilty because the only evidence linking the defendant to an apartment where police discovered drags was his presence at the scene and the fact that he possessed a set of keys that unlocked the apartment. We concluded that \u201c[t]he ability to exercise control over the premises and the defendant\u2019s brief presence in them is insufficient ... to imply constructive possession of the hidden contraband.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 101. Unlike our decision in the <em>Brzezinski </em>case, there was no additional evidence linking the defendant\u2019s access to the apartment to the drags located inside. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Boria, </em>440 Mass. 416, 418-420 (2003) (fact that defendant living in place where two others also present and drugs in plain view and being sold not sufficient to support inference of intent to control where there was no additional incriminatory evidence).</p>\n<p id=\"b674-6\">Here, in order to \u201cestablish the defendant\u2019s \u2018relationship\u2019 to contraband located in a common area sufficient to permit an inference of control over the contraband, there must be a more particular link to the defendant\u201d other than his presence and ownership. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Boria, supra </em>at 420-421, citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pratt, supra. </em>Although the defendant was the owner of the vehicle and was present in the vehicle, there was nothing specifically connecting him to the firearm. The defendant was not wearing a holster sized to fit the firearm, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Escalera, supra </em>at 649 (holster found in defendant\u2019s bedroom sized to fit two handguns recovered from basement where drugs located), nor was he carrying ammunition that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>matched the weapon. Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gonzalez, </em>452 Mass. 142, 147 (2008) (sufficient evidence of intent to control where defendants were found in presence of cocaine and heroin, apartment was barricaded and sparsely furnished, and defendants possessed unusually large amounts of cash). Moreover, he made no attempt to conceal the firearm from Deveney. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McIntosh, </em>78 Mass. App. Ct. 37, 41-42 (2010) (sufficient evidence of intent to control firearm where presence was supplemented by evidence that defendant ran to bedroom and proceeded directly to location under mattress where firearm was found); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cotto, </em>69 Mass. App. Ct. 589, 593 (2007) (following vehicle stop, defendant\u2019s actions of shoving feet under driver\u2019s seat where firearm ultimately discovered and staring at police officer during search support inference of intent constructively to possess firearm). Without additional inculpatory evidence linking the defendant\u2019s proprietary interest in his vehicle to the firearm in Alvarez\u2019s physical possession, the defendant\u2019s ownership of the vehicle had little bearing on his intent to control the firearm.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-5\">We have similar reservations regarding the defendant\u2019s operation of the vehicle. In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jefferson, </em>461 Mass. 821, 827-828 (2012), we held that the evidence adduced at trial was sufficient to support convictions of unlawful possession of a firearm based on a theory of joint constructive possession.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In that case, the driver sped away from police after being pulled over for a routine traffic violation. At the conclusion of the ensuing high-speed pursuit, police retraced the route of chase and discovered a firearm, which the passenger apparently had thrown from the vehicle. We concluded that the driver\u2019s decision to stop initially, only to speed away for the purpose of disposing of the firearm, evinced an intent to control the firearm. <em>Id. </em>Significantly, our decision did not rest solely on the defendant\u2019s status as the operator of the vehicle; rather, it was based on the defendant\u2019s decision to engage in a high-speed chase and the insight that this course of action provided into his probable intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-6\">Here, by contrast, the nature of the defendant\u2019s operation did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>not manifest any outward signs that the firearm belonged to him or that he intended to control the firearm. His vehicle was legally parked on the side of the road directly outside his girl friend\u2019s residence. The defendant made no attempt to evade Deveney or manipulate the vehicle in any way to dispose of the weapon. At best, the fact that the defendant was the operator of the vehicle served only to put him in the proximity of the firearm and did not provide evidentiary support for the proposition that he intended to control the firearm.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-4\">Our extended discussion of the defendant\u2019s ownership and operation of the vehicle stems from a concern that naked reliance on these factors comes \u201cperilously close to endorsing guilt by presence at the scene of contraband, a concept we have disavowed.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sespedes, supra </em>at 102. We do not intimate that ownership and operation are never relevant in assessing one\u2019s intent to exercise control over specific contraband. However, they are insufficient in the absence of additional evidence connecting the individual\u2019s ownership or operation to the contraband. To conclude otherwise would risk imposing a \u201cnew rule of strict liability for owner/operators of automobiles and premises regardless of what their actual intent to possess a weapon or contraband might be.\u201d <em>Romero, supra </em>at 807 (Trainor, J., dissenting). Such a standard of liability would potentially subject owners of property or vehicles to criminal prosecution by \u201csimply tolerating the presence of a weapon or contraband within the limits of their proprietary interest.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b676-5\">Our assessment regarding the defendant\u2019s intent to control the firearm is not altered after taking into consideration the defendant\u2019s proximity to the weapon, evidence more relevant in the circumstances of this case to whether the defendant had the <em>ability </em>to control the firearm, than his intention to exercise that control.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-6\">Because neither the defendant\u2019s ownership or operation nor his proximity to the firearm, alone or in combination, is sufficient to support his conviction, the sufficiency of the evidence rests on the location, time of the encounter, and behavior of the passengers. However, these considerations are inapposite. As the dissent in the Appeals Court decision correctly points out, <em>Romero, supra </em>at 810 (Trainor, J., dissenting), our decision in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Albano, </em>373 Mass. 132, 134-136 (1977), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>which relies heavily on circumstantial evidence relating to the time of night and location, was aimed at establishing the defendant\u2019s knowledge of the firearm, not his intent to exercise control and dominion over it. Thus, at least in the context of this case, the factual considerations cited by the Commonwealth shed little light on the defendant\u2019s intent. Accordingly, we conclude that the evidence was insufficient to support the defendant\u2019s conviction of unlawful possession of a firearm based on a theory of constructive possession.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b677-4\">3. <em>Conclusion. </em>Because we conclude that the evidence was insufficient as a matter of law to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant unlawfully possessed a firearm in violation of G. L. c. 269, \u00a7 10 (a), we reverse his conviction and direct that a verdict of not guilty be entered.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-5\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b667-7\">We acknowledge the amicus brief of the Committee for Public Counsel Services.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b667-8\">Because we dispose of the case on this ground, we do not address whether the judge\u2019s admission of the ballistician\u2019s report without his in-court testimony or the application of the \u201cequal and inconsistent\u201d doctrine independently entitles the defendant to relief.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b669-6\"> \u201cAn admission in a criminal case is a statement by the accused, direct or implied, of facts pertinent to the issue, which although insufficient in itself to warrant a conviction tends in connection with proof of other facts to establish his guilt.\u201d Mass. G. Evid. \u00a7 801(d)(2)(A) (2012), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bonomi, </em>335 Mass. 327, 347 (1957).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b669-7\">The defendant\u2019s argument that his out-of-court statement to Officer Dennis M.
