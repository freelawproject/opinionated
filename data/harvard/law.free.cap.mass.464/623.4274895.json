Cotter, for several years, the plaintiff, Metropolitan Life Insurance Company (MetLife), determined that Cotter had failed to satisfy a clause in his \u201cown occupation\u201d disability <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>insurance policy that required him to receive care by a physician that \u201cis appropriate for the condition causing the disability.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Interpreting this clause as requiring Cotter to pursue treatment aimed at returning him to his prior occupation, MetLife advised Cotter that the care he was receiving was not appropriate because it expressly disavowed a return to his prior occupation, and, indeed, was focused on a \u201creturn to work in [an] alternate occupation.\u201d MetLife informed Cotter that it would continue to pay him benefits under a reservation of rights during the pendency of the litigation, and filed an action in the Superior Court seeking a judgment declaring that it had no continuing obligation to pay benefits to Cotter and reimbursement of benefits it had paid under the unilaterally asserted reservation of rights. Cotter filed counterclaims for violations of G. L. c. 93A and G. L. c. 176D.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-5\">Following a jury-waived trial, a Superior Court judge directed the entry of a judgment declaring that, because Cotter was not receiving care \u201cappropriate for the condition causing the disability,\u201d MetLife was not required to continue paying him benefits, but declaring also that MetLife was not entitled to restitution of any benefits paid. The judge denied Cotter\u2019s counterclaims and his motion for reconsideration. The judge also denied MetLife\u2019s motion to amend the judgment. Both parties filed timely notices of appeal, and we granted Cotter\u2019s motion for direct appellate review.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-6\">We are asked to determine the standard of care required where a disability insurance contract conditions payment of benefits upon receipt of care \u201cappropriate for the condition causing the disability.\u201d We must determine also whether, absent a policy provision authorizing such reimbursement, an insurer may obtain reimbursement of benefits paid to an insured who was not receiving the required care.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-7\">We conclude that Cotter is not entitled to benefits under the policy, since he is not receiving care designed to enable him to return to his prior occupation, and affirm so much of the judgment as declares that MetLife has no continuing obligation to pay Cotter disability benefits. We conclude also that MetLife is not entitled to reimbursement for benefits it has paid Cotter, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>affirm so much of the judgment as declares that Cotter has no obligation to reimburse MetLife for such benefits, but on grounds other than those relied on by the trial judge. See <em>Kelly </em>v. <em>Avon Tape, Inc., </em>417 Mass. 587, 590 (1994) (appellate court may uphold correct ruling by trial court on ground different from that relied on by trial court).</p>\n<p id=\"b643-5\">1. <em>Background. </em>We recite the facts found by the trial judge, augmented by facts in the record that the parties do not dispute. In 1995, Cotter purchased an \u201cown occupation\u201d disability insurance policy<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> from an affiliate of MetLife.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In September, 2004, Cotter was diagnosed with cancer of the prostate; he underwent a radical prostatectomy in November. Following the surgery, Cotter took a leave of absence from his job as a sales manager for a global broker of electronic components, a position involving long hours in a high-stress, fast-paced environment, which Cotter described as akin to working on the trading floor of a stock exchange.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> He also filed a claim for disability benefits. Although Cotter returned to work on January 31, 2005, he was unable to perform satisfactorily, in part due to postsurgical <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>incontinence, and his employment was terminated two weeks later. He resubmitted his disability claim, this time for disability occasioned by incontinence. In February, 2005,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Cotter began receiving disability payments of $5,750 per month, and began treatment for incontinence with two urologists.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-5\">As part of his treatment for incontinence, Cotter had been referred to a social worker at the Dana Farber Cancer Institute. Staff there determined that Cotter was not recovering well from the psychological and emotional effects of the surgery and his postsurgery limitations, and recommended that Cotter receive psychological counselling. In September, 2005, Cotter began seeing Dr. Jonathan Weiss, a licensed psychiatrist who was one of the practitioners on a list provided by Cotter\u2019s medical insurer.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-6\">Cotter\u2019s difficulties with incontinence were largely resolved by October, 2005, and one of his urologists notified MetLife that Cotter should be able to return to work by November 5. MetLife advised Cotter by letter that his benefits would be discontinued as of November 30, and suggested that, if he still felt unable to return to work, he submit any additional medical information relative to his claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-7\">Following receipt of MetLife\u2019s letter, Cotter requested that his claim be reopened on the basis of a psychiatric disability. On November 30, Weiss submitted a letter to MetLife stating that Cotter was in \u201ctreatment with\u201d him and that Cotter was \u201cnot able to return to work at this time for medical reasons.\u201d On December 22, 2005, Weiss submitted an \u201cattending physician\u2019s statement\u201d requested by Metlife. Weiss reported that Cotter was suffering from \u201cmajor depression, single episode, severe,\u201d with \u201cgradual stabilization anticipated.\u201d In February, 2006, Weiss changed his diagnosis to \u201cmajor depression, recurrent,\u201d a diagnosis which has remained unchanged since then. Weiss prescribed a treatment regimen of antidepressant and anti-anxiety medications and \u201csupportive\u201d therapy. While Weiss monitored the impact of the medications, and the dosages of certain medications have changed, his general recommendations <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>of antidepressant and antianxiety medications and supportive therapy have not changed since that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-4\">Cotter reported to Weiss that he felt he was unable to think or function as he had before, and that he would be unable to perform under the high-stress conditions of his job in the electronics industry. He had difficulty concentrating or handling multiple tasks at one time, a necessity in the electronics broker trading floor environment where he had managed numerous people calling out purchase and sale orders for his approval while the customer, frequently in another country, waited on the telephone. Cotter also discussed these concerns with his then MetLife claims representative. In May, 2006, Cotter obtained a teaching certificate and subsequently began working as a substitute special education teacher in a public high school.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In October, 2006, he began serving as an aide to one of the school\u2019s students with autism, a position which paid $14,273 per year. MetLife continued to pay the full $5,750 monthly disability benefit during this period.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b645-5\">In the spring of 2007, MetLife assigned Cotter\u2019s file to a new <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>claims representative who arranged for him to be evaluated by two independent medical examiners (IMEs), Dr. Lawrence S. Fieman, a neuropsychologist, and Dr. Ronald Schouten, a psychiatrist. Fieman reviewed Cotter\u2019s medical records, conducted a clinical interview, and administered the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory-2 (MMPI-2) test. Fieman concluded that Cotter\u2019s clinical profile did not support a diagnosis of major depression, but noted that fatigue and lack of focus \u201care not addressed\u201d by the MMPI-2. Fiemen opined that Cotter\u2019s medications<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> could be contributing to his reported fatigue and anxiety, and that there were \u201cno significant psychological barriers to full time employment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b646-5\">After interviewing Cotter and reviewing his medical records, Schouten determined that Cotter did \u201cnot appear to be suffering from Major Depression or another significant Axis I disorder . . . [but did] evidence symptoms consistent with chronic Adjustment Disorder with mixed depression and anxiety.\u201d Schouten credited Cotter\u2019s statements that he had difficulty concentrating and focusing on tasks; that stress, pressure, and decisionmaking overwhelm him; and that the multitasking required in his former employment with the brokerage firm would be impossible for him. Schouten\u2019s clinical examination supported Cotter\u2019s reported difficulties in concentration and inattention, consistent with anxiety and depression. Schouten noted Cotter\u2019s concerns about his medical conditions and the financial pressures on his family, but noted also that Cotter found teaching to be lower stress and more rewarding than his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>previous occupation. Schouten determined that \u201cCotter\u2019s current symptoms [did] appear to be interfering with his ability to return to work,\u201d and that \u201c[a]t present, [his] attentional difficulties would interfere with his ability to handle multiple high-pressure business transactions.\u201d Schouten observed also that \u201cthe role of his multiple medications,\u201d at least five of which could have effects on the central nervous system, \u201ccannot be ruled out.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b647-5\">Schouten concluded,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b647-6\">\u201cMost importantly, it is clear from examination of Mr. Cotter that he has suffered what can only be described as an existential crisis as a result of his medical problems. This has led him to question the meaning of life, his career choices, and how he has provided for his family. He is now drawn to a vocation that is less stressful and provides him with emotional fulfillment. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b647-7\">\u201cMr. Cotter is exhausted and frightened by his medical condition, and fearful of the prospect of trying to return to his old job and not performing adequately. He has little motivation to return to his old position and clearly prefers his current lifestyle. While his current financial situation is much worse than when he was working, it is better than it would be if he were to return to work and [be] fired. . . . At this point, Mr. Cotter does not see [his former] job as being a good fit for him. Mr. Cotter does appear to have accepted the role of being chronically ill.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b647-8\">Schouten recommended an alternate treatment plan, including reassessment of Cotter\u2019s medications and weekly psychotherapy with an \u201cemphasis on anxiety management and cognitive behavioral therapy [CBT] and occupational rehabilitation services.\u201d Schouten opined, \u201cAssuming the [recommended] suggestions are successful and Mr. Cotter is motivated to return to his old position, [he] could likely return to work within [six] months.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b647-9\">On April 24, 2007, MetLife obtained an updated attending physician\u2019s statement from Weiss. In response to the question, posed by MetLife for the first time, \u201cIs return to work a focus of the treatment plan?\u201d Weiss answered \u201cNo,\u201d and explained, \u201cpursuing alternate employment.\u201d Weiss responded similarly in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>all subsequent physician statements that he submitted to MetLife. In reply to MetLife\u2019s request that Weiss review Pieman\u2019s and Schouten\u2019s reports, and Schouten\u2019s recommendations, Weiss stated in a telephone message, \u201cMr. Cotter is not motivated to return to his former job. He is pursuing another vocation. That is the focus of our treatment, and the fact that [Schouten wants] him to be motivated does [not] change things.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b648-4\">In his May 21, 2007, attending physician\u2019s statement, Weiss replied affirmatively to the question, \u201cAre there secondary conditions impairing your patient\u2019s work capacity?\u201d and stated, \u201cPatient [is] not motivated to return to former employment.\u201d In response to the question whether return to work was a focus of his treatment, Weiss wrote, <em>\u201cnot </em>to former employment, yes to different vocation\u201d (emphasis in original). Under \u201cadditional remarks,\u201d Weiss noted, \u201cTreatment goal focused on <em>change </em>in occupation\u201d (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b648-5\">MetLife sent a letter to Cotter on June 4, 2007, asserting that Weiss did not appear to be willing to pursue Schouten\u2019s recommendations, which it believed to be appropriate for Cotter\u2019s condition, and that it would be \u201cclosely evaluating] \u201d whether Weiss\u2019s treatment represented appropriate care under the terms of the policy. On June 20, MetLife also sent a letter to Weiss, stating that it had concluded that Cotter was not interested in returning to his former occupation and that Weiss would not be pursuing Schouten\u2019s recommendations. On June 25, Weiss replied:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b648-6\">\u201cI have reviewed Dr. Schouten\u2019s report and discussed it with Mr. Cotter. Mr. Cotter is not motivated or interested in returning to his former occupation. I should note that I also do not recommend he pursue his former employment, as to do so would certainly severely exacerbate his psychiatric and physical conditions, and likely incapacitate him. He is pursuing other, less stressful, employment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b648-7\">\u201cDr. Schouten\u2019s report describes Mr. Cotter as not motivated to return to his former occupation and I agree with this.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b648-8\">\u201cDr. Schouten\u2019s recommendations apply to a hypotheti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>cal situation, and I do not disagree with his recommendation in that context. However, they do not address the reality of Mr. Cotter\u2019s current psychiatric and physical condition, and his change of career goals. These matters are being addressed in Mr. Cotter\u2019s current treatment with me.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b649-4\">The judge interpreted this letter \u201cas saying that Cotter would be harmed if he were to return to his old employment <em>in his then current state,\u2019\u2019'\u2019 </em>not that Cotter would be harmed if he were to return to his old employment after receiving appropriate treatment (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b649-5\">MetLife also had its in-house medical consultant, Dr. John J. Szlyk, review Cotter\u2019s file. Szlyk noted that Weiss had not followed any of Schouten\u2019s recommendations, and opined that Cotter\u2019s \u201creported lack of motivation to return to his former position may be a matter of choice in this particular situation, as there has been no clinical evidence that [Cotter\u2019s] focusing on RTW [return to work] with the support of a comprehensive treatment plan would be detrimental.\u201d Szlyk suggested a \u201cphysician-to-physician\u201d call to discuss these concerns with Weiss. After MetLife approved this recommendation, Szlyk asked an administrative assistant to schedule the conference call. Weiss answered the telephone call and requested that the assistant relay a message to Szlyk: \u201cI\u2019m really tired of talking about Mr. Cotter, and I have nothing new to say.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b649-6\">MetLife\u2019s claims representative noted that Weiss had not disputed the reasonableness or appropriateness of Schouten\u2019s recommendations, and had not asserted that they would be harmful to Cotter. On October 1, 2007, MetLife informed Cotter by letter that it had concluded that he was no longer eligible to receive disability benefits:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b649-7\">\u201cIt is our understanding that with the appropriate care, the evidence suggests you would be able to return to your regular occupation. Based upon our discussions with Dr. Weiss, it is apparent that you have chosen not to pursue an avenue of treatment which would allow you to return to your regular occupation. ... It is your right to [choose] not to pursue the care that would return you to your <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>occupation. However, in order to continue to receive benefits, it is your obligation under the terms of your policy to obtain curative treatment that is available and which is reasonably expected to allow you to return to work. Therefore, we have concluded that you are no longer eligible for benefits under the terms of your policy.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b650-5\">MetLife stated that it had commenced litigation to determine the parties\u2019 rights and obligations under the policy, and that it would continue to pay benefits to Cotter during the course of the litigation, but only \u201cunder a reservation of rights,\u201d including the right to seek reimbursement of benefit payments.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b650-6\">In February, 2010, MetLife required Cotter to undergo a two-day evaluation by Dr. Thomas J. Deters, a neuropsychologist whom it had retained for that purpose. Deters reviewed all of the previously administered evaluations and reports undertaken at MetLife\u2019s request, and administered a number of psychological tests.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Deters concluded that Cotter\u2019s cognition was in the \u201caverage to high average\u201d range and had not been impaired by depression. Disagreeing with Weiss\u2019s diagnosis of major depression and with his treatment plan, Deters reported that Cotter suffered from an adjustment disorder which should be treated with CBT and not with psychotropic medications.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-7\">While noting that Weiss, who had \u201ca more thorough and longstanding familiarity with [Cotter] than any of the other three\u201d doctors who reported on Cotter\u2019s condition to MetLife, had diagnosed Cotter with \u201cmajor depressive disorder,\u201d a diagnosis with which the other three disagreed, the trial judge determined that it was unnecessary to resolve the question. He emphasized that Weiss had not stated that the course of treatment recommended by Schouten would be ineffective or harm<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number>ful to Cotter or to someone suffering from major depression. The judge concluded that Cotter was not receiving appropriate care under the terms of the policy, and therefore that he was ineligible for benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-5\">2. <em>Discussion. </em>Disability insurance policies often require the insured to receive some level of medical care in order to be eligible for benefits. See <em>Heller </em>v. <em>Equitable Life Assur. Soc\u2019y, </em>833 F.2d 1253, 1257 (7th Cir. 1987) (requiring physician\u2019s care serves purpose of showing that insured is in fact disabled, is not malingering, and is not making fraudulent claim). Care provisions also \u201cserve the additional purpose of minimizing the insurer\u2019s loss under the policy in cases in which the insured\u2019s disability can benefit from a physician\u2019s care\u201d by encouraging \u201cinsureds to seek prompt medical treatment for their disabling conditions,\u201d potentially avoiding \u201cfurther deterioration of a disabling condition or speed[ing] the insured\u2019s recovery,\u201d and thereby \u201cprotecting the insurer from unnecessary harm.\u201d <em>Stin-nett </em>v. <em>Northwestern Mut. Life Ins. Co., </em>101 F. Supp. 2d 720, 725-726 (S.D. Ind. 2000). See 1 G. Couch, Insurance, \u00a7 146:23 (3d ed. 1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b651-6\">Care provisions generally fall into two types,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> either requiring care that is \u201cregular\u201d or care that is \u201cappropriate.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> See, e.g., <em>Provident Life &amp; Acc. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Van Gemert, </em>262 F. Supp. 2d 1047, 1049-1050 (C.D. Cal. 2000), and cases cited. Regular care is care that is provided on an ongoing basis by a licensed practitioner. See <em>Heller </em>v. <em>Equitable Life Assur. Soc\u2019y, supra </em>(declining to interpret \u201cregular care and attendance\u201d by physi-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"634\">*634</page-number>clan as meaning care appropriate for insured\u2019s condition, and concluding that \u201cregular care\u201d means no more than regular monitoring of insured by physician). See also <em>Bakal </em>v. <em>Paul Revere Life Ins. Co., </em>576 F. Supp. 2d 889, 900 (N.D. Ill. 2008), quoting <em>Heller </em>v. <em>Equitable Life Assur. Soc\u2019y, supra </em>(\u201cregular care\u201d of physician has \u201cgenerally been construed to mean \u2018the insured is obligated to periodically consult and be examined by his or her treating physician at intervals to be determined by the physician\u2019 \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b652-4\">Appropriate care is care that is \u201cappropriate for\u201d the disabling condition. See <em>Provident Life &amp; Acc. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Henry, </em>106 F. Supp. 2d 1002, 1004 (C.D. Cal. 2000) (\u201cappropriate\u201d care \u201cwould be determined objectively as the treatment a patient would make a reasonable decision to accept after duly considering the opinions of medical professionals\u201d). See also <em>Provident Life &amp; Acc. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Van Gemert, supra </em>at 1049-1057 (disability policy requiring insured to be receiving \u201ccare by a physician which is appropriate for the condition causing the disability. . . cannot reflect an intent of the parties that the insurer will be obligated to pay benefits even if the insured stubbornly refuses the only appropriate \u2018care\u2019 recommended\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b652-5\">a. <em>Appropriate care clause in Cotter\u2019s policy. </em>Cotter\u2019s policy states that, in order to be entitled to the payment of benefits, \u201cYou (i.e., \u2018the insured\u2019)\u201d must be \u201cunable to perform the material and substantial duties of Your Occupation\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> and must be \u201creceiving Physician\u2019s Care.\u201d \u201cPhysician\u2019s Care\u201d is defined as \u201cthe regular and personal care of a Physician which, under prevailing medical standards, is appropriate for the condition causing the disability.\u201d See note 11, <em>supra. </em>MetLife maintains that Cotter is ineligible for benefits because he failed to obtain, as required under the terms of his policy, care \u201cappropriate for the condition causing the disability.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b652-6\">The interpretation of an insurance contract is a question of law, <em>Boston Gas Co. </em>v. <em>Century Indent. Co., </em>454 Mass. 337, 355 (2009), which we review de novo. <em>Rhodes </em>v. <em>AIG Domestic Claims, Inc., </em>461 Mass. 486, 495 (2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b652-7\">\u201c [Interpretation of language in an insurance contract \u2018is no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number>different from the interpretation of any other contract, and we must construe the words of the policy in their usual and ordinary sense.\u2019 \u201d <em>Metropolitan Prop. &amp; Cas. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Morrison, </em>460 Mass. 352, 362 (2011), quoting <em>Boston Gas Co. </em>v. <em>Century Indem. Co., supra. </em>\u201cEvery word in an insurance contract \u2018must be presumed to have been employed with a purpose and must be given meaning and effect whenever practicable.\u2019 \u201d <em>Allmerica Fin. Corp. </em>v. <em>Certain Underwriters at Lloyd\u2019s, London, </em>449 Mass. 621, 628 (2007), quoting <em>Jacobs </em>v. <em>United States Fid. &amp; Guar. Co., </em>417 Mass. 75, 77 (1994). If the meaning of the contract language is unclear, we \u201cconsider what an objectively reasonable insured, reading the relevant policy language, would expect to be covered.\u201d <em>Hazen Paper Co. </em>v. <em>United States Fid. &amp; Guar. Co., </em>407 Mass. 689, 700 (1990). \u201cAny ambiguities in the language of the contract are interpreted against the insurer who used them and in favor of the insured.\u201d <em>Allmerica Fin. Corp. </em>v. <em>Certain Underwriters at Lloyd\u2019s, London, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b653-4\">Since we have not previously had occasion to construe the requirement that care be \u201cappropriate for the condition causing the disability,\u201d we turn for guidance to how such clauses have been interpreted in other jurisdictions. As discussed below, in construing language virtually identical to the language in Cotter\u2019s disability insurance policy, courts in other jurisdictions have reached significantly differing conclusions. Decisions generally fall under two lines of reasoning, treating the phrase as requiring care that either meets prevailing medical standards or is designed specifically to enable a return to the insured\u2019s prior occupation, even when other medically appropriate treatments are available. A few courts have applied a requirement that is substantially similar to the standard for \u201cregular care.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b653-5\">Courts following the first line of reasoning interpret care \u201cappropriate for the condition causing the disability\u201d to mean care appropriate under prevailing medical standards. In <em>Postma </em>v. <em>Paul Revere Life Ins. Co., </em>223 F.3d 533, 541-542 (7th Cir. 2000), the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit considered a disability insurance policy where \u201cdoctor\u2019s care\u201d was defined as \u201cthe regular and personal care of a [djoctor which under prevailing medical standards, is appropriate for the condition causing the disability.\u201d It concluded that the insured, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"636\">*636</page-number>who had begun working at another job after a back injury, was entitled to residual disability benefits. The insured\u2019s physician stated that he provided \u201cappropriate doctor\u2019s care\u201d for the back injury. Because the insurer did not provide evidence to show that the physician\u2019s care did not meet prevailing medical standards, the court held that the insured was under a \u201cdoctor\u2019s care\u201d according to the terms of the policy. See, e.g., <em>Eichacker </em>v. <em>Paul Revere Life Ins.

An objectively reasonable insured, see <em>Hazen Paper Co. </em>v. <em>United States Fid. &amp; Guar. Co., supra, </em>would accordingly understand \u201cthe condition causing the disability\u201d to mean the condition preventing the insured from returning to his prior occupation. It follows that care is \u201cappropriate for the condition causing the disability\u201d where, to the extent medically <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number>and otherwise reasonable, it seeks to ameliorate the condition preventing the insured from returning to his or her prior occupation.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-5\">Such a reading comports with the purpose of the appropriate care clause \u201cto insure proper treatment so as to shorten the period of disability.\u201d <em>Kottle </em>v. <em>Provident Life &amp; Acc.

Cotter contends that the care he received from Weiss, a psychiatrist, was generally appropriate for treating his psychiatric disability, and thus satisfied the appropriate care clause. Although Cotter\u2019s reading is of some appeal when considering the clause in isolation, such a reading does not comport with the reasonable expectations of the parties in the \u201cown occupation\u201d policy as whole, see <em>Finn </em>v. <em>National Union Fire Ins. Co., </em>452 Mass. 690, 695 (2008), nor with the liability-limiting purpose of the appropriate care clause. See <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number><em>Provident Life &amp; Acc. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Henry, supra </em>at 1004. Cotter\u2019s reading would permit an insured to collect disability benefits even where he rejected undisputedly safe, noninvasive, and effective care that would permit him to return to his prior occupation, so long as the care he chose was generally medically appropriate for his underlying condition. We reject such a construction.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-4\">To be sure, care that is generally medically appropriate for a particular condition will often necessarily also be care that seeks to ameliorate the impediments preventing an insured from returning to his or her prior occupation. In some cases, however, a physician may prescribe a course of treatment that, while medically appropriate, will not enable a recovery that allows the insured to return to his or her former occupation. See, e.g., Paul Revere Life Ins. Co. vs. DiBari, <em>supra. </em>Where an insured can show that such a course of treatment is reasonable, the care may be considered appropriate. Absent an explicit showing why such a course of treatment is reasonable, however, care expressly disavowing the insured\u2019s return to his or her prior occupation will not satisfy the requirement of \u201ccare appropriate to the condition causing the disability\u201d in a disability insurance policy defining \u201ctotal disability\u201d as being \u201cunable to perform the material and substantial duties\u201d of \u201cthe occupation... in which [the insured was] regularly engaged at the time [the disability began].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b657-5\">Here, Weiss consistently and unambiguously informed MetLife that it was not the goal of Cotter\u2019s treatment to address and alleviate the psychiatric disability to the extent necessary to allow Cotter to return to his prior occupation. Rather, citing Cotter\u2019s \u201cchange of career goals\u201d and lack of \u201cmotivation,\u201d Weiss directed Cotter\u2019s treatment toward adopting a less stressful, alternate occupation. Nowhere in the evidence presented did Weiss dispute the conclusions of MetLife\u2019s experts that, given a different course of treatment and motivation to do so, Cotter likely could return to his former occupation, or that such treatment posed any risk to Cotter\u2019s mental or physical well-being.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-6\">It was Cotter\u2019s burden as the insured to prove that his claim was covered by the policy. See <em>Lustenberger </em>v. <em>Boston Cas. Co., </em>300 Mass. 130, 135 (1938). As the judge observed, nothing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>in Weiss\u2019s statements indicated that Cotter would be harmed by the cognitive behavioral therapy recommended by Schouten. However, Weiss refused to participate in the conference call designed to clarify his treatment and recommendations, or to elaborate on his recommendations in any of his reports. Weiss did not testify at trial, and his deposition testimony was not available.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The judge construed Weiss\u2019s letter stating, \u201cI also do not recommend [Cotter] pursue his former employment, as to do so would certainly severely exacerbate his psychiatric and physical conditions, and likely incapacitate him,\u201d as meaning \u201cthat Cotter would be harmed if he were to return to his old employment <em>in his then current </em>state\u201d rather than returning after having received CBT (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b658-5\">Had Weiss testified, it could readily have been ascertained whether he intended this inferred limitation as to Cotter\u2019s \u201cthen current state.\u201d Cf. <em>Pralutsky </em>v. <em>Metropolitan Life Ins. Co., </em>435 F.3d 833, 840 (8th Cir.), cert, denied, 549 U.S. 887 (2006). The failure to introduce Weiss\u2019s or other pertinent testimony in this regard, however, resulted in Cotter\u2019s inability to refute MetLife\u2019s contention that its recommendations would not have been harmful to Cotter, and therefore that Weiss\u2019s treatment of Cotter was not appropriate. Contrast <em>Postma </em>v. <em>Paul Revere Life Ins. Co., </em>223 F.3d 533, 541-542 (7th Cir. 2000) (where physician testified that he provided appropriate care, and insurer, who disputed care was appropriate for condition causing disability, did not provide evidence to show care did not meet prevailing medical standards, insured established that care was appropriate).</p>\n<p id=\"b658-6\">Because Cotter failed to establish that he was receiving appropriate care as required by the terms of the policy,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> the trial judge declared correctly that MetLife has no continuing obligation to pay Cotter disability benefits.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b658-7\">b. <em>Reimbursement under reservation of rights. </em>By the time of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"641\">*641</page-number>trial in December, 2010, MetLife had paid Cotter a total of $224,250 in monthly benefits over the approximately three-year period following its unilateral assertion of an extracontractual reservation of its rights.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> MetLife maintains that it is entitled to restitution of all benefits it paid Cotter \u201cwhich would not have been due had he received appropriate care.\u201d Relying on <em>Medical Malpractice Joint Underwriting Ass\u2019n </em>v. <em>Goldberg, </em>425 Mass. 46 (1997) <em>(Goldberg), </em>the judge concluded that MetLife was not entitled to reimbursement, since the policy did not contain any provision authorizing a reservation of rights, and since Cotter neither expressed agreement with MetLife\u2019s position that he was not entitled to benefits nor agreed to reimburse MetLife should its position prevail.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-5\">Ordinarily, a claim of unjust enrichment will not lie \u201cwhere there is a valid contract that defines the obligations of the parties.\u201d <em>Boston Med. Ctr. Corp. </em>v. <em>Sec\u2019y of the Executive Office of Health &amp; Human Servs., </em>463 Mass. 447, 467 (2012), citing Restatement (Third) of Restitution and Unjust Enrichment \u00a7 2 (2011). However, in circumstances where one party to a contract demands performance from the other that is not due under the terms of the contract, the other party may \u201crender such performance under protest or with reservation of rights, preserving a claim in restitution to recover the value of the benefit conferred in excess of the recipient\u2019s contractual entitlement.\u201d Restatement (Third) of Restitution and Unjust Enrichment \u00a7 35(1) (2011). We have not previously had occasion to determine if an insurer may seek <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number>reimbursement of disability insurance benefits paid to an insured under a unilateral and extracontractual reservation of rights.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b660-5\">In the context of liability insurance policies, an insurer may undertake the defense of an insured pursuant to a unilateral reservation of rights and such a defense will \u201cnot estop the insurer from subsequently disclaiming liability because the insured had been put on notice of such possible disclaimer and could . . . take necessary steps to protect its rights.\u201d <em>Herbert A. Sullivan, Inc. </em>v. <em>Utica Mut. Ins. Co., </em>439 Mass. 387, 406 (2003). In <em>Goldberg, supra </em>at 58-59, we concluded that an insurer may seek reimbursement for an amount paid to settle a tort action, but \u201conly if the insured has agreed that the insurer may commit the [insurer\u2019s]<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> own funds to a reasonable settlement with the right later to seek reimbursement from the insured, or if the insurer secures specific authority to reach a particular settlement which the insured agrees to pay.\u201d<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> However, we noted that reimbursement would be inappropriate where, as in the circumstances in that case, an insurer entered into a settlement \u201cto <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number>protect its interests [by limiting its potential exposure to a G. L. c. 93A claim], and not the interests of [the insured].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 60-61.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-5\">The rationale underlying our decision in the liability insurance context, however, reflects a recognition that the liability insurer\u2019s \u201cduty to defend is independent from, and broader than, its duty to indemnify.\u201d <em>Metropolitan Prop. &amp; Cas. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Morrison, </em>460 Mass. 352, 357 (2011), quoting A. <em>W. Chesterton Co. </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Insurers Insolvency Fund, </em>445 Mass. 502, 527 (2005). Much of our concern in <em>Goldberg, supra, </em>then, centered on the insured\u2019s lack of involvement with or consent to the settlement. This situation is unlikely to arise in the disability insurance context, where an insured who is the recipient of disability benefits ordinarily cannot claim to be removed from the payment process.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-6\">Our decision in <em>Goldberg, supra, </em>does not itself foreclose MetLife\u2019s claim for reimbursement under a reservation of rights. We therefore consider whether MetLife has established an entitlement to reimbursement under the equitable principles of unjust enrichment. Cf. <em>Massachustts Cas. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Rosen, </em>953 F. Supp. 311, 315 (C.D. Cal. 1996) (acknowledging insurer\u2019s right to seek reimbursement of disability benefit payments made pursuant to a unilateral reservation of rights).</p>\n<p id=\"b661-7\">\u201cA quasi contract or a contract implied in law is an obligation created by law \u2018for reasons of justice, without any expression of assent and sometimes even against a clear expression of dissent.\u2019 \u201d <em>Salomon </em>v. <em>Terra, </em>394 Mass. 857, 859 (1985), quoting 1 A.

See <em>Keller </em>v. <em>O\u2019Brien, supra </em>at 778-779. In order to prevail on its claim for reimbursement of disability insurance benefits it paid to Cotter under a reservation of rights, MetLife must establish not only that Cotter received a benefit, which is not disputed, but also that such a benefit was unjust. MetLife asserted in its complaint that it was \u201centitled to a return of any benefits paid to Mr. Cotter which would not have been due had he received appropriate care.\u201d It sought a judgment awarding it \u201crestitution of all disability benefits paid to Mr. Cotter under the Policy from the point in time that Mr. Cotter would have been able to return to perform the substantial duties of his occupation if he had received appropriate medical care for his allegedly disabling condition.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b662-6\">MetLife, however, did little more than establish that it made timely benefit payments under an extracontractual and unilateral reservation of rights. It did not establish that Cotter\u2019s receipt of income replacement benefits was unjust. Indeed, it did not even establish the factual predicate for its claim that it was entitled to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number>a return of any benefits paid \u201cwhich would not have been due had he received appropriate care.\u201d MetLife\u2019s experts, for example, did not opine to a reasonable degree of medical certainty that, if their recommendations had been undertaken, Cotter would ever be able to return to his former occupation. Nor did MetLife otherwise establish by a preponderance of the evidence that there was a point in time at which Cotter would have been able to return to his prior occupation had he received the \u201cappropriate care\u201d the insurer recommended.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b663-5\">The purpose of disability insurance benefits is for an insured to receive income replacement payments upon satisfying the policy conditions. It is likely often to be the case that such payments will be the insured\u2019s only source of income. Even in instances where an insurer \u201cin good faith denies a claim of coverage on the basis of a plausible interpretation of the insurance policy,\u201d <em>Lumbermen\u2019s Mut. Cas. Co. </em>v. <em>Offices Unlimited, Inc., </em>419 Mass. 462, 468 (1995),<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> the insured is put to something of a Hobson\u2019s choice where benefits are paid pursuant to the insurer\u2019s unilateral reservation of rights. He can either accept the benefits at the risk of incurring substantial, if not crip<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number>pling, liability should reimbursement be awarded the insurer, see <em>Sprague </em>v. <em>Equifax, Inc., </em>166 Cal. App. 3d 1012, 1031 (Cal. Ct. App. 1985) (\u201cA debt is as much an economic loss as the removal of payments, particularly where the debtor is disabled and without income to make repayment\u201d), or decline the benefits which may be his only source of income while engaging in costly coverage litigation with the insurer. Given this, absent some indication of fraud on the part of the insured, a deliberate failure by the insured to comply with a treating physician\u2019s recommendation, or conduct of comparable gravity, an insurer bears a heavy burden when it seeks to show that the insured\u2019s retention of disability benefits was unjust. MetLife has not met that burden here.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-4\">MetLife\u2019s own experts testified that Weiss\u2019s treatment of Cotter met the standard of care for a patient in his condition,<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> and there is no suggestion that Cotter did not comply fully with Weiss\u2019s treatment plan. By the time that MetLife made its determination that Cotter was not receiving appropriate care, and began paying benefits under its unilateral reservation of rights, Cotter had been under Weiss\u2019s care for approximately two years, and had undertaken substantial steps towards the treatment goal of a less stressful occupation, including obtaining a teaching certificate. While the judge made no findings on this point, the record suggests that MetLife was aware of, and apparently did not at the time contest, Cotter\u2019s efforts to obtain the teaching certificate and to seek teaching positions, approximately one and one-half years before it determined that the care was not appropriate. At no point did Weiss express agreement with MetLife\u2019s determination that his recommended treatment was not appropriate under the policy, nor did Cotter express agreement with MetLife\u2019s assessment that Weiss\u2019s treatment protocol was not appropriate care. As earlier noted, MetLife does not establish that, had Cotter followed its recommended <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>treatment plan, he would more likely than not be able to return to his prior occupation.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-4\">In sum, MetLife has failed to meet its burden of establishing that it was unjust for Cotter to retain the income replacement benefits he received following the insurer\u2019s unilateral reservation of rights. The judge concluded correctly that MetLife was not entitled to reimbursement.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b642-8\">We acknowledge the amicus brief of America\u2019s Health Insurance Plans in support of the plaintiff, Metropolitan Life Insurance Company (MetLife).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b643-6\">An \u201cown occupation\u201d disability policy is distinct from an \u201cany occupation\u201d policy.

The formula used to calculate the \u201cresidual disability\u201d amount encompassed the five years of earnings prior to the onset of the disability, and required payment of the \u201ctotal disability\u201d amount if the difference between current earnings and predisability earnings was greater than seventy-five per cent of predisability earnings.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-9\">Because of Cotter\u2019s high salary for several years before his disability \u2014 in one year he earned over $1 million \u2014 Cotter was entitled to the full disability <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>amount under the policy regardless whether MetLife paid him \u201ctotal disability\u201d or \u201cresidual disability\u201d benefits. As the judge noted, MetLife never made an explicit determination regarding which section of the policy was applicable, but all of its letters to Cotter referenced the term \u201ctotal disability.\u201d One of MetLife\u2019s claims representatives testified at trial that she never considered a \u201cresidual disability\u201d claim because she believed that Cotter initially had filed his claim under the \u201ctotal disability\u201d section of the policy. The claim forms did not have a section to indicate under which portion of the policy the claim was being made. In any event, the \u201cPhysician\u2019s Care\u201d language applicable to a \u201ctotal disability\u201d is identical to that applicable to a \u201cresidual disability\u201d (i.e., care by a physician that is \u201cappropriate for the condition causing the disability\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b646-7\">In addition to the medications prescribed by Weiss, Cotter was taking a number of other prescription medications for various physical conditions, including his prostate condition and high blood pressure.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b650-8\">Shortly thereafter, Cotter obtained a position paying $60,000 per year as \u201cdirector of day supports\u201d in a nonprofit facility providing day care for mentally disabled adults. In this role, Cotter was responsible for supervising three to five managers and approximately forty employees. He was terminated from that position after two years of employment for failure to maintain adequate records, and he was unemployed at the time of trial. Cotter asserted at trial that his difficulties in concentrating contributed significantly to his inability to maintain proper records.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b650-9\">Deters declined to disclose details of any of the tests he administered, citing confidentiality requirements.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b651-7\">The care provision at issue here requires both types of care.

To the extent that we are able to construe the claim, we conclude that there was no error in the judge\u2019s decision denying Cotter\u2019s claim that MetLife acted deceptively in providing him with Schouten\u2019s report, but not providing the questions posed by MetLife that served as the basis for some of Schouten\u2019s responses.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b659-7\">In its October 1, 2007, letter informing Cotter that it had determined he was no longer entitled to benefits, MetLife stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b659-8\">\u201cRather than terminate your benefits, while the lawsuit is pending, we will continue to pay you under a reservation of all rights and defenses until further order or decision by the [cjourt. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b659-9\">\u201cPursuant to our reservation of rights, we will seek reimbursement of all benefits paid to you while the lawsuit is pending, in the event that it is determined that we do not have liability on your claim.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b660-6\">In <em>French King Realty Inc. </em>v. <em>Interstate Fire &amp; Cas.

Further, MetLife\u2019s experts agreed neither on whether Cotter should be taking antidepressant medications nor on whether those medications were contributing to his difficulties in functioning. Nor did MetLife\u2019s experts agree on the type of psychotherapy that Cotter should be receiving to enable him to return to his prior occupation, or its likelihood of success; they all opined, however, that Weiss\u2019s \u201csupportive\u201d therapy was not the correct approach. As to the likelihood of success of his recommended treatment, Schouten opined only that, \u201c[i]f motivated to return to his former occupation, and if the cause of his attentional problems can be identified and addressed, Mr. Cotter should be able to return to work.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"23\">\n<p id=\"b663-7\">While MetLife\u2019s interpretation of what constitutes \u201cappropriate care\u201d under the policy was certainly a plausible interpretation, it was not the only plausible interpretation, and the state of the law was not well established on the point when MetLife made its coverage determination.
