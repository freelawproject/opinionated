When the family patriarch, James E. Clair, Sr., died in 2004, his four sons \u2014 James E. Clair, Jr.; Mark J. Clair; Joseph P. Clair; and Michael S. Clair (collectively, Clair brothers) \u2014 held approximately equal ownership interests in the companies. In November, 2007, the Clair brothers sold most of the companies\u2019 dealerships, real estate, and other assets to Prime Motor Group (Prime Motors). A few years thereafter, following the deaths of two of the Clair brothers, family relationships began to deteriorate.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-7\">On April 9, 2010, Claire M. Clair, the executrix of the estate of her husband, James E. Clair, Jr., and Jane M. Clair, the executrix of the estate of her husband, Mark J. Clair (together, the plaintiffs), brought an action in the Superior Court against Joseph P. Clair, Michael S. Clair, and the companies (collectively, the defendants),<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> challenging the disposition of business assets that remained after the 2007 sale to Prime Motors. In connection with their civil action, Claire unsuccessfully sought, through service of subpoenas duces tecum, testimony and documents from James C. Jones, the companies\u2019 general counsel, and from Robert E. Richards, Jr., the companies\u2019 outside counsel (together, corporate counsel). The basis for the lawyers\u2019 noncompliance with the subpoenas was attorney-client privilege.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> On March 11, 2011, Claire filed a motion to compel testimony and the production of documents from corporate counsel. Following a hearing, a judge allowed Claire\u2019s motion on May 17, 2011.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The com-panics then filed a petition for interlocutory relief pursuant to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 118, first par., with a single justice of the Appeals Court. The single justice allowed the petition and reported his decision to a panel of that court.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> We transferred the case to this court on our own motion. For reasons slightly different from those articulated by the judge below, we affirm the order of the Superior Court, subject to specified limitations.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"Axh\">1. <em>Background. </em>For purposes of the present appeal, the facts are drawn from the allegations in the plaintiffs\u2019 verified second amended complaint, the motion judge\u2019s memorandum of decision and order on Claire\u2019s motion to compel, and relevant documents in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"AFe\">During a span of fifty years, James E. Clair, Sr., built the Clair Auto Group from a single Buick dealership in the West Roxbury section of Boston into one of New England\u2019s largest automobile dealership chains. The companies are comprised of closely held corporations, limited partnerships, trusts, and limited liability companies.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Over time, the Clair brothers entered the family business and became directors, officers, shareholders, partners, and members of the companies. As of 2004, the year their father died, each brother\u2019s ownership share of the companies was approximately twenty-five per cent. A majority of the companies\u2019 valuable assets were held by Clair International, Inc. (Clair International), and Clair, L.R (Clair LP).</p>\n<p id=\"Amm\">Pursuant to a 1998 stockholders\u2019 agreement for Clair International (stockholders\u2019 agreement),<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> James, Joseph, and Mark each were required to \u201capply for, own, and be the beneficiary of life insurance policies on the life of each of the other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>Stockholders (other than James E. Clair, Sr.)\u201d in designated amounts.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The stockholders\u2019 agreement subsequently was amended on January 1, 2003,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> and January 1, 2004. As significant here, the final amendment to the stockholders\u2019 agreement, dated October 1, 2006, wholly revised the section on life insurance to provide that Clair International would \u201capply for, own and maintain life insurance policies on the life of each of the Stockholders\u201d; that Clair International or its affiliates \u201cshall be the beneficiary of such policies\u201d; and that Clair International would pay all premiums in connection with the life insurance policies.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Ownership of the policies thus was transferred from the individual Clair brothers to Clair International and Clair LP. The life of each brother was insured by two policies. The 2006 amendment to the stockholders\u2019 agreement further provided that Clair International was purchasing and maintaining such insurance \u201cas a means to make payment to the estate of a deceased Stockholder for the purchase of all or a portion of the Stock owned by the deceased Stockholder.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b226-5\">After the Clair brothers sold most of the companies\u2019 assets to Prime Motors in November, 2007, a majority of the proceeds, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>totaling approximately $80 million, were distributed to the shareholders. The companies\u2019 remaining assets consisted of, among other things, money held in a reserve account,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> funds to service warranty claims, and several parcels of real estate. In addition, Clair International and Clair LP continued to own the life insurance policies. However, once Prime Motors purchased substantially all of the assets of the companies, it no longer was necessary for Clair International and Clair LP to maintain the life insurance policies on the Clair brothers in order to be able to fund a buyout of a deceased shareholder\u2019s stock. After receiving advice from corporate counsel, Clair International and Clair LP offered each shareholder the opportunity to purchase the policies individually.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The purchase price would be established in accordance with each policy\u2019s interpolated terminal reserve (ITR) value.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> The purchase and transfer of the life insurance policies to the Clair brothers was arranged by, among others, the companies\u2019 outside counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-5\">Mark died suddenly on December 1, 2007, shortly after the closing on the sale of the companies\u2019 assets to Prime Motors, but before the completion of the necessary paperwork to effectuate the transfer of his insurance policies from Clair International and Clair LP. Mark\u2019s ownership interests in the companies passed to his estate. According to the plaintiffs, at a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>special shareholders\u2019 meeting held on December 10, 2007, the three surviving Clair brothers and corporate counsel acknowledged and confirmed that Clair International and Clair LP had entered into binding agreements to transfer ownership of the life insurance policies to the individual Clair brothers, each of whom would pay the ITR values of his respective policies.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Thus, when the life insurance proceeds for Mark were paid by the insurers, Joseph, on behalf of Clair International and Clair LP, indorsed the checks (totaling $12 million) to Mark\u2019s estate in exchange for payment of the policies\u2019 ITR values. The companies made no claim at that time that Mark\u2019s estate must surrender his shares of the companies.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-5\">Joseph and Michael, on behalf of Clair International and Clair LP, also executed documents transferring ownership of James\u2019s life insurance policies to irrevocable trusts that he had created.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Outside counsel directed James to remit one-half of the policies\u2019 ITR values to Clair International and the other half of the policies\u2019 ITR values to Clair LP, and those payments were made immediately. The irrevocable trusts created by James thereafter paid the individual premiums on his life insurance policies. James then died on March 4, 2008. His ownership interests in the companies passed to his estate. The insurers paid approximately $12 million in life insurance proceeds to the irrevocable trusts that James had created. The companies made no claim at that time that James\u2019s estate must surrender his shares of the companies.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-6\">Following their brothers\u2019 deaths, Joseph and Michael remained in control of the companies, managing the assets that remained after the 2007 sale to Prime Motors. Over the next two years, they routinely treated the plaintiffs as shareholders who held the same ownership interests as their late husbands, provided them with financial information about the companies, involved them in various aspects of corporate decision-making, and distributed profits to them on a periodic basis. This apparently cordial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>relationship began to deteriorate in early 2009, when Joseph and Michael sought to gain ownership of the plaintiffs\u2019 interests in the companies, for little or no consideration, under a variety of legal theories. Pursuant to one theory, the shares that had been held by Mark and James were deemed to have been tendered back to the companies on their deaths under the buyout provision of the stockholders\u2019 agreement, and the life insurance proceeds paid to each estate constituted payment for the repurchase of those shares.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Therefore, in the view of Joseph and Michael, the plaintiffs had not been shareholders of the companies since the deaths of their husbands.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-5\">Around the same time that Joseph and Michael were attempting to gain ownership of the shares that had been held by Mark and James, Claire was requesting financial information about the companies\u2019 income and expenses. The information that was provided by outside counsel suggested to Claire that substantial disbursements had been made for what appeared to be personal, rather than business-related, expenses. This ongoing family dispute reached its culmination when the plaintiffs filed their action against the defendants in the Superior Court, seeking, among other things, a declaratory judgment pursuant to G. L. c. 231A as to their ownership rights in the companies.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b229-6\">In the defendants\u2019 answer to the plaintiffs\u2019 complaint, Clair International and Clair LP asserted separate counterclaims against Claire<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> and Jane,<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> both individually and in each one\u2019s capacity <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>as executrix of her husband\u2019s estate.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> They sought to compel the tender of certain stock and ownership interests in the companies, and the return of monies improperly paid in excess of that to which each estate was entitled under the stockholders\u2019 agreement. Michael filed a separate answer to the plaintiffs\u2019 complaint and asserted a counterclaim against Claire,<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> in her capacity as executrix of her husband\u2019s estate, alleging that James had breached his fiduciary duty to Michael and others.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b230-5\">In light of these counterclaims, Claire pursued discovery on a broad range of matters pertaining to the management of the companies. On June 25, 2010, she served subpoenas duces tecum on corporate counsel, seeking both testimony and documents concerning, among other things, the valuation, purchase, and sale of the life insurance policies by the companies to the Clair brothers; the ownership interests in the companies from 2005 to the present; the 2007 sale of the companies\u2019 assets to Prime Motors; the appraisals of the companies\u2019 former and current assets; the companies\u2019 financial statements; and the various documents pertaining to the governance of the companies. Attorney Richards objected to his subpoena on the grounds that it sought testimony and documents that were \u201cprotected by the attorney-client privilege and/or the work product doctrine.\u201d Claire\u2019s counsel was able to take the deposition testimony of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>Attorney Jones on September 23, 2010. However, according to Claire, nothing of substance was elicited because Jones\u2019s lawyer objected to nearly every question on the basis of attorney-client privilege.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-5\">On March 11, 2011, Claire filed a motion to compel testimony and the production of documents from corporate counsel pursuant to Mass. R. Civ. R 37, as amended, 423 Mass. 1406 (1996). Claire first asserted that, once she stepped into James\u2019s shoes as executrix of his estate, she was within the companies\u2019 attorney-client privilege. As such, she was entitled to the same privileged information to which James, as a director, officer, shareholder, partner, and member of the companies, would have had access. Second, Claire asserted that she was entitled to all privileged communications regarding the valuation, purchase, and sale of the life insurance policies from Clair International and Clair LP to the Clair brothers, including legal advice from corporate counsel, because the defendants had placed such information at issue in their counterclaims, thereby waiving attorney-client privilege.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-6\">In allowing Claire\u2019s motion to compel, the judge first agreed with Claire\u2019s argument that, as executrix of James\u2019s estate, she held his privilege with respect to all communications with corporate counsel prior to his death. In the judge\u2019s view, there was no dispute that Claire stood in James\u2019s shoes, that the attorney-client privilege belonged to the companies, and that corporate counsel therefore had information that all shareholders were entitled to obtain. As such, the defendants could not assert attorney-client privilege with respect to communications between corporate counsel and any member of this group in connection with the business of the companies. The judge next stated that the matter was \u201cmore nuanced\u201d with respect to communications that occurred between the defendants and corporate counsel following James\u2019s death. In the judge\u2019s view, Claire\u2019s argument that she was entitled to this information was premised on her contention that she was a shareholder. However, any determination of Claire\u2019s status as a shareholder rested on the information that she sought to compel from corporate counsel. According to the judge, given that the issues in this case centered around disputes among the shareholders and their successors, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>the information and documents in the possession of corporate counsel had to be equally available to all parties. The judge therefore concluded that corporate counsel could not avoid testifying at a deposition by asserting a blanket attorney-client privilege. At a minimum, the plaintiffs were entitled to explore the circumstances and claimed bases for the invocation of the privilege, and to be given a privilege log with respect to each and every document that corporate counsel sought to withhold on the basis of attorney-client privilege.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b232-5\">2. <em>Standard of review. </em>\u201cThe focus of appellate review of an interlocutory matter is \u2018whether the trial court abused its discretion \u2014 that is, whether the court applied proper legal standards and whether the record discloses reasonable support for its evaluation of factual questions.\u2019 \u201d <em>Caffyn </em>v. <em>Caffyn, </em>441 Mass. 487, 490 (2004), quoting <em>Edwin R. Sage Co. </em>v. <em>Foley, </em>12 Mass. App. Ct. 20, 25 (1981). \u201cOn appeal from any decision on [an attorney-client] privilege claim, we review the trial judge\u2019s rulings on questions of law de novo.\u201d <em>Commissioner of Revenue </em>v. <em>Comcast Corp., </em>453 Mass. 293, 302 (2009). An appellate court may affirm a correct result based on reasons that are different from those articulated by the judge below. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Va Meng Joe, </em>425 Mass. 99, 102 (1997); <em>Aetna Cas. &amp; Sur. Co. </em>v. <em>Continental Cas. Co., </em>413 Mass. 730, 734-735 (1992). \u201cIt is well established that, on appeal, we may consider any ground apparent on the record that supports the result reached in the lower court.\u201d <em>Gabbidon </em>v. <em>King, </em>414 Mass. 685, 686 (1993), and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-6\">3. <em>Circle of attorney-client privilege. </em>The companies contend that the judge erred in concluding that Claire, either in her capacity as executrix of James\u2019s estate or as a putative shareholder, is entitled to discovery of the companies\u2019 confidential and privileged communications with corporate counsel. They assert that the attorney-client privilege belongs to the companies, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>not to James, and that Claire did not become part of the circle of privilege simply because she became the executrix of James\u2019s estate on his death. In the companies\u2019 view, Claire did not step into James\u2019s corporate shoes such that she now can access privileged communications between the companies and corporate counsel. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-5\">It is well established that \u201cthe attorney-client privilege shields from the view of third parties all confidential communications between a client and its attorney undertaken for the purpose of obtaining legal advice.\u201d <em>Suffolk Constr. Co. </em>v. <em>Division of Capital Asset Mgt., </em>449 Mass. 444, 448 (2007). See <em>Upjohn Co. </em>v. <em>United States, </em>449 U.S. 383, 390 (1981) (attorney-client privilege exists \u201cto protect not only the giving of professional advice to those who can act on it but also the giving of information to the lawyer to enable him to give sound and informed advice\u201d). We consistently have held that the privilege is to be construed narrowly. See <em>Commissioner of Revenue </em>v. <em>Comcast Corp., supra </em>at 304; <em>Matter of the Reorganization of Elec. Mut. Liab. Ins. Co. Ltd. (Bermuda), </em>425 Mass. 419, 421 (1997); <em>Judge Rotenberg Educ. Ctr., Inc. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of the Dep\u2019t of Mental Retardation (No. 1), </em>424 Mass. 430, 457 n.26 (1997). The party asserting attorney-client privilege has the burden of establishing that the privilege applies to the communications at issue.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> See <em>Commissioner of Revenue </em>v. <em>Comcast Corp., </em>supra; <em>Suffolk Constr. Co. </em>v. <em>Division of Capital Asset Mgt., supra </em>at 450 n.9.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-6\">As a general proposition, \u201c[a] lawyer employed or retained <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>by an organization represents the organization acting through its duly authorized constituents.\u201d Mass. R. Prof. C. 1.13 (a), as appearing in 450 Mass. 1301 (2008). We have recognized that \u201c[a]n attorney for a corporation does not simply by virtue of that capacity become the attorney for . . . its officers, directors or shareholders.\u201d <em>Robertson </em>v. <em>Gaston Snow &amp; Ely Bartlett, </em>404 Mass. 515, 522, cert, denied, 493 U.S. 894 (1989), quoting 1 R.E. Mallen &amp; J.M. Smith, Legal Malpractice \u00a7 7.6 (3d ed. 1989). To the contrary, \u201cattorneys serving as counsel to a corporation owe a duty to act according to the interests of the corporation and not in the interests of a nonclient stockholder, director, officer, employee, or other representative of the corporation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 524 n.5. See <em>Evans </em>v. <em>Artek Sys.

Fletcher, Cyclopedia of Corporations \u00a7 25, at 54 (rev. ed. 2006) (\u201ca duly organized corporation enjoys a legal identity separate and apart from its shareholders, directors and officers\u201d). Accordingly, the attorney-client privilege belongs to the organization, not to each director, officer, or shareholder. See generally <em>Schaeffer </em>v. <em>Cohen, Rosenthal, Price, Mirkin, Jennings &amp; Berg, P.C., </em>405 Mass. 506, 513 (1989) (\u201ccounsel for closely held corporation does not by virtue of that relationship alone have an attorney-client relationship with individual shareholders\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b234-5\">It follows that the power to assert or waive \u201cthe corporate attorney-client privilege rests with the corporation\u2019s management and is normally exercised by its officers and directors.\u201d <em>Commodity Futures Trading Comm\u2019n </em>v. <em>Weintraub, </em>471 U.S. 343, 348 (1985). The Massachusetts Business Corporation Act (Act) provides that \u201c[a]ll corporate power shall be exercised by or under the authority of, and the business and affairs of the corporation shall be managed under the direction of, its board of directors, subject to any limitation set forth in the articles of organization or in [a shareholder] agreement.\u201d<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> G. L. c. 156D, \u00a7 8.01 <em>(b). </em>See <em>Kelly </em>v. <em>Citizens Fin.

See also <em>Symmons </em>v. <em>O\u2019Keeffe, </em>419 Mass. 288, 298 n.10 (1995) (individual directors not entitled to waive company\u2019s attorney-client privilege as to communications with corporate counsel). The corporate managers \u201cmust exercise the [attorney-client] privilege in a manner consistent with their fiduciary duty to act in the best interests of the corporation and not of themselves as individuals.\u201d <em>Commodity Futures Trading Comm\u2019n </em>v. <em>Weintraub, supra </em>at 349. See <em>Robertson </em>v. <em>Gaston Snow &amp; Ely Bartlett, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b235-5\">Contrary to Claire\u2019s contention, she did not simply assume James\u2019s role as a director of the companies when, on his death, she became the executrix of his estate. Pursuant to the plain language of the Act, the directors of a corporation \u201cshall be elected at the first annual shareholders\u2019 meeting and at each annual meeting thereafter unless their terms are staggered.\u201d G. L. c. 156D, \u00a7 8.03 <em>(d). </em>Claire has not alleged that she has been elected to serve as a director of the companies, which is a necessary precondition to obtaining access to privileged communications given that the attorney-client privilege belongs to the companies, not to each individual director. The fact that Claire steps into James\u2019s shoes for purposes of administering his estate,<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> see generally <em>District Attorney for the Norfolk Dist. </em>v. <em>Magraw, </em>417 Mass. 169, 172 (1994) (executor of deceased client\u2019s estate vested with power to exercise or waive attorney-client privilege on decedent\u2019s behalf); <em>Matter of a John Doe Grand Jury Investigation, </em>408 Mass. 480, 483 (1990) (same), does not mean that she automatically assumes his role as a director of the companies with access to privileged communications.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-6\">We add that, in his role as a director of the companies, James had an obligation to preserve or waive the companies\u2019 attorney-client privilege in a manner that was consistent with his fiduciary duty to act in the companies\u2019 best interests. See <em>Commodity Futures Trading Comm\u2019n </em>v. <em>Weintraub, supra </em>at 348-349. See <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>also G. L. c. 156D, \u00a7 8.30 (a) (3) (director obligated to discharge duties \u201cin a manner the director reasonably believes to be in the best interests of the corporation\u201d). If Claire automatically had assumed the position of a director of the companies on James\u2019s death, then she would be bound by this same fiduciary duty. The nature of these proceedings is such that Claire seeks access to privileged communications in order to support her lawsuit to protect the interests of James\u2019s estate, not the interests of the companies.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> Thus, not only has Claire not been elected to serve as a director of the companies, but her position is fundamentally inconsistent with being a director.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-14\">We conclude that the judge erred in determining that Claire, as executrix of James\u2019s estate, stepped into his shoes as a director of the companies and, therefore, was entitled to have access to the companies\u2019 privileged communications with corporate counsel. This conclusion, however, is not the end of our inquiry regarding Claire\u2019s ability to discover such privileged communications. We now consider whether the companies have waived their attorney-client privilege in a manner that would afford Claire access to at least some of the information that she seeks.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-15\">4. <em>\u201cAt issue\u201d waiver. </em>The companies contend that, contrary to Claire\u2019s assertion, they have not placed at issue their privileged communications with corporate counsel regarding the transfer of ownership of the life insurance policies from Clair International and Clair LP to the individual Clair brothers. To the extent that Claire needs certain information to support her claims or defenses, the companies assert that there is nothing in the record to suggest that their privileged communications with corporate counsel are the only sources of information available to Claire. Therefore, they continue, the attorney-client privilege remains firmly intact. Even if that were not the case, the companies argue that the judge failed to limit the scope of discovery to those privileged communications that truly are \u201cat issue.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b236-20\">In <em>Darius </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>433 Mass. 274 (2001) <em>(Darius), </em>we articulated a general framework for considering the \u201cat issue\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>waiver doctrine under Massachusetts law. See <em>McCarthy </em>v. <em>Slade Assocs., Inc., </em>463 Mass. 181, 191-192 (2012); <em>Global Investors Agent Corp. </em>v. <em>National Fire Ins. Co., </em>76 Mass. App. Ct. 812, 816-819 (2010). We recognized that there are \u201ccertain exceptions to the attorney-client privilege and some circumstances in which the privilege may be deemed waived other than by express waiver.\u201d <em>Darius, supra </em>at 277. In particular, \u201ca litigant may implicitly waive the attorney-client privilege, at least partly, by injecting certain claims or defenses into a case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>See Mass. G. Evid. \u00a7 523(b)(2) (2012) (privilege waived where person or entity holding privilege \u201cintroduces privileged communications as an element of a claim or defense\u201d). See also <em>Zabin </em>v. <em>Picciotto, </em>73 Mass. App. Ct. 141, 158 (2008) (\u201cThe nature of the defendants\u2019 allegations placed the work [the attorney] performed in the underlying litigation directly at issue, and [the attorney] was the only source available to testify regarding the work she performed\u201d). This is the heart of the \u201cat issue\u201d waiver doctrine. See <em>Darius, supra </em>at 277-278. Cf. <em>Greater Newburyport Clamshell Alliance </em>v. <em>Public Serv. Co. of N.H., </em>838 F.2d 13, 20 (1st Cir. 1988). \u201c[A] party may resist discovery on the basis of privilege, but may not at the same time rely on the privileged communications or information as evidence at trial.\u201d <em>G.S. Enters., Inc. </em>v. <em>Falmouth Marine, Inc., </em>410 Mass. 262, 270-271 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b237-5\">We opined in <em>Darius </em>that the scope of an \u201cat issue\u201d waiver is not to be viewed too broadly. See <em>Darius, supra </em>at 283. When it is recognized in particular circumstances, an \u201cat issue\u201d waiver \u201cshould not be tantamount to a blanket waiver of the entire attorney-client privilege in the case. By definition, it is a limited waiver of the privilege with respect to what has been put \u2018at issue.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>See generally <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Brito, </em>390 Mass. 112, 119 (1983) (\u201cOnce such a charge [of ineffective assistance of counsel] is made, the attorney-client privilege may be treated as waived at least in part, but trial counsel\u2019s obligation may continue to preserve confidences whose disclosure is not relevant to the defense of the charge of his ineffectiveness as counsel\u201d). In addition, \u201cthere can be no \u2018at issue\u2019 waiver unless it is shown that the privileged information sought to be discovered is not available from any other source.\u201d <em>Darius, supra </em>at 284. See <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number><em>McCarthy </em>v. <em>Slade Assocs., Inc., supra </em>at 192. See also <em>Greater Newburyport Clamshell Alliance </em>v. <em>Public Serv. Co. of N.H., supra </em>at 22 (parties seeking to discover privileged communications \u201cdo not have to prove that it is absolutely unavailable from other sources\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b238-8\">With this framework in mind, we conclude that the companies effected an \u201cat issue\u201d waiver of their attorney-client privilege regarding communications with corporate counsel about the transfer of the life insurance policies from Clair International and Clair LP to the individual Clair brothers. In Count I of their counterclaims, Clair International and Clair LP allege that \u201cJames breached his fiduciary duties to his fellow shareholders by failing to fairly value his insurance policies as of the date of sale, or alternatively, failing to fully and fairly disclose the potential tax liability and consequences of the sale of his insur-anee policies to his fellow shareholders.\u201d As a consequence of James\u2019s actions, the Clair brothers \u201csuffered damages and harm.\u201d Based on these allegations, the disclosures that James may or may not have made to the Clair brothers and to corporate counsel regarding the life insurance policies, and their related communications about whether to proceed with the transfer of ownership of the policies, are at the heart of proving or disproving the counterclaim.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> The substance of these communications is essential to determining whether the Clair brothers were fully and accurately informed about the material facts and legal effects of the transfers.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-28\">Claire\u2019s ability to present a defense to this counterclaim hinges on what exactly the Clair brothers knew about the life insurance policies. The only available sources of this information are corporate counsel, Joseph, and Michael, all of whom are within the circle of privilege held by the companies. Arguably, the companies\u2019 meeting minutes, particularly those from the special shareholders\u2019 meeting held on December 10, 2007, might shed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>some light on what the Clair brothers knew about the life insurance policies, but those minutes cannot be located. Contrary to the companies\u2019 assertion, simply reading \u201cthe contracts\u201d will not enable Claire to ascertain whether the Clair brothers, in fact, had been apprised of the pertinent details concerning the policies. The companies have resisted discovery on the basis of attorney-client privilege, but Clair International and Clair LP have relied on privileged communications about the life insurance policies to support their counterclaim that James breached his fiduciary duties to his fellow shareholders. They cannot have it both ways. Because this counterclaim depends on an assessment of James\u2019s disclosures regarding the life insurance policies, and on an assessment of the Clair brothers\u2019 actual knowledge about the details surrounding the transfer of those policies, the companies have placed their otherwise privileged communications \u201cat issue.\u201d See <em>Global Investors Agent Corp. </em>v. <em>National Fire Ins. Co., </em>76 Mass. App. Ct. 812, 818-819 (2010). Therefore, the attorney-client privilege as to these matters has been waived.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-5\">We are mindful that an \u201cat issue\u201d waiver is not \u201ctantamount to a blanket waiver of the entire attorney-client privilege\u201d between the companies and corporate counsel. <em>Darius, supra </em>at 283. In her subpoenas duces tecum, Claire sought testimony and documents from corporate counsel on a wide range of matters pertaining to the operation of the companies. Such a discovery request is too broad. We conclude that Claire is entitled to discovery of all privileged communications between the companies and corporate counsel, both testimonial and documentary, that specifically relate to the life insurance policies.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> It is only as to such information that the attorney-client privilege has been waived.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-6\">5. <em>Conclusion. </em>The order of the Superior Court judge entered May 17, 2011, allowing Claire\u2019s motion to compel testimony and the production of documents from corporate counsel, is af<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>firmed insofar as the communications relate specifically to the life insurance policies.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-5\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b224-23\">Because they share a surname, we refer to the Clair brothers by their first names.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b224-24\">The applicability of the work product doctrine is not at issue in this appeal.

Nonetheless, she said that the judge\u2019s order also should apply to Jane, as executrix of Mark\u2019s estate, because Jane was in the same position as Claire in attempting to obtain information from corporate counsel. In his memorandum <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>of decision and order, the motion judge noted that the issues raised by Claire had equal relevance to Jane, and he seemed to give Jane the same access to privileged communications as he afforded to Claire.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"acd-dedup-0\">All proceedings in the Superior Court have been stayed pending resolution of the present appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"APL\">On March 10, 2011, the plaintiffs filed a motion to disqualify Murphy &amp; King, P.C., as counsel for Joseph P.

The companies\u2019 obligation to maintain and fund the reserve account terminated on November 21, 2009. As of that date, there were no pending claims, so the approximately $2.5 million in the reserve account was available for distribution to the shareholders.
