(HSBC), claiming to be the holder of a mortgage given by the defendant, Jodi B. Matt, filed a complaint in equity in the Land Court, under the Massachusetts Soldiers\u2019 and Sailors\u2019 Civil Relief Act (Massachusetts act or act), to determine if Matt was entitled to foreclosure protections under the Federal Servicemembers Civil Relief Act (Federal SCRA or SCRA), 50 U.S.C. app. \u00a7\u00a7 501 et seq. (2006). The Massachusetts act, which provides a procedural framework for ascertaining whether mortgagors are entitled to protections under the SCRA, expressly permits only those defendants who assert entitlement to such rights to appear in equitable proceedings brought pursuant to the SCRA (servicemember proceedings). See St. 1943, c. 57 (1943), as amended through St. 1998, c. 142.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-4\">While conceding that she is not entitled to protection under the SCRA, Matt nonetheless moved to dismiss the complaint on the ground that HSBC lacked standing to bring a servicemem-ber proceeding because it was not the clear holder of either her note or her mortgage. After ordering discovery, a Land Court judge denied Matt\u2019s motion, concluding that HSBC had standing by virtue of its right to purchase Matt\u2019s mortgage.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-11\">Because Matt was not entitled to appear or be heard at the servicemember proceeding, the court should not have accepted or entertained Matt\u2019s filings. Nonetheless, the judge having undertaken to examine HSBC\u2019s standing, the question before us is whether he properly applied the correct standard in concluding that HSBC had established standing. Because standing to bring a servicemember proceeding is limited to plaintiffs who satisfactorily establish that they are mortgagees or agents thereof, we conclude that the judge\u2019s determination of HSBC\u2019s standing on the basis of a different standard is incorrect.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-21\">1. <em>Statutory framework. </em>The Federal SCRA, passed in 1940, is modeled after the Soldiers\u2019 and Sailors\u2019 Civil Relief Act of 1918, which in turn was based on State civil relief acts passed during the American Civil War. See Folk, Tolling of Statutes of Limitations Under Section 205 of the Soldiers\u2019 and Sailors\u2019 Civil Relief Act, 102 Mil. L. Rev. 157, 159 (1983). In its current form, and consistent with its history, the SCRA \u201cprovide[s] for the temporary suspension of judicial and administrative <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>proceedings and transactions that may adversely affect the civil rights of servicemembers during their military service.\u201d 50 U.S.C. app. \u00a7 502. Among the protections granted to service-members, the SCRA provides that a \u201csale, foreclosure, or seizure of property for a breach of an obligation\u201d conducted while a party is in the military<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> \u201cshall not be valid. . . except . . . (1) upon a court order granted before such sale, foreclosure, or seizure; or (2) if made pursuant to an agreement [between the parties].\u201d 50 U.S.C. app. \u00a7 533(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b213-5\">In Massachusetts, a mortgagee<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> seeking to assure compliance with the SCRA prior to commencing foreclosure proceedings could bring an action in equity to obtain an appropriate court order.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> See <em>Lynn Inst. for Sav. </em>v. <em>Taff, </em>314 Mass. 380, 386 (1943); <em>Great Barrington Sav. Bank </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>239 Mass. 546, 547 (1921). In 1941, the Legislature, concerned that servicemembers were not receiving adequate notice of servicemember proceedings, passed the Massachusetts act, which set forth certain procedural requirements for such equitable actions.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> St. 1941, c. 25, preamble. The act was thereafter amended on multiple <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>occasions to provide additional procedural and substantive limitations. See St. 1943, c. 57.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-5\">Prominent among these are the jurisdictional limitations, which provide:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b214-6\">\u201cIn proceedings under this section, <em>no person </em>who is not a record owner of the equity of redemption in the mortgaged property and <em>who is not entitled to the benefit of the [SCRA] . . . shall be entitled to appear or be heard in such proceeding, </em>except on behalf of a person so entitled, or unless an affidavit by the claimant,. . . stating that he is entitled to the benefits of [the SCRA], is filed with the appearances. <em>Such proceedings shall be limited to the issues of the existence of such persons and their rights if any.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b214-7\">St. 1943, c. 57, \u00a7 1, as amended through St. 1990, c. 496, \u00a7 1. In concert with the limited subject matter of the proceeding, the act now limits the relief granted at proceedings where a defendant is not entitled to the benefits of the SCRA to a \u201cdecree by the court that no person is then subject to or is entitled to the benefits of the [SCRA], [which] shall forever bar the persons named in the bill or complaint from complaining that such foreclosure or seizure is invalid under said act.\u201d* *<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b214-8\">Servicemember proceedings \u201coccur independently of the actual foreclosure itself and of any judicial proceedings determinative of the general validity of the foreclosure.\u201d <em>Beaton </em>v. <em>Land Court, </em>367 Mass. 385, 390, appeal dismissed, 423 U.S. 806 (1975) <em>(Beaton). </em>See <em>Akar </em>v. <em>Federal Nat\u2019l Mtge. Ass\u2019n, </em>845 F. Supp. 2d 381, 396-397 (D. Mass. 2012) (\u201cthe Land Court [servicemember] action [does] not mark the commencement of foreclosure proceedings\u201d). \u201cIf a foreclosure were otherwise properly made, failure to comply with the [SCRA] would not render the foreclosure invalid as to anyone not entitled to the protection of that act.\u201d <em>Beaton, supra </em>at 390. Failure to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>bring a servicemember proceeding, however, will leave the title vulnerable to a challenge that the foreclosure sale was defective due to the possibility that it violated a mortgagor\u2019s rights under the SCRA. See <em>id. </em>Thus, a servicemember proceeding is neither a part of nor necessary to the foreclosure process; it simply ensures that a foreclosure will not be rendered invalid for failure to provide the protections of the SCRA to anyone so entitled, an assurance that also could be obtained at a postforeclosure action to quiet title under G. L. c. 240, \u00a7 6. See <em>Silva </em>v. <em>Massachusetts, </em>351 Fed. Appx. 450, 452 n.2 (1st Cir. 2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b215-5\">2. <em>Background and prior proceedings. </em>HSBC, the trustee for ACE Securities Corp. Home Equity Loan Trust Series 2005-HE4 Asset Backed Pass-Through Certificates (trust), asserted in its servicemember complaint that it was \u201cthe assignee and holder of a mortgage\u201d given by Matt. HSBC additionally submitted a mortgagee\u2019s affidavit,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> signed by Countrywide Home Loans Servicing, LP (Countrywide), a servicer of loans contained in the trust, in which Countrywide averred that it was \u201cauthorized to act by and on behalf of either of the Mortgagee or one holding under the Mortgagee\u201d and that it had provided notice to Matt of her right to cure a default in payment on her mortgage, as required by G. L. c. 244, \u00a7 35A. Matt conceded that she was not entitled to the protections of the SCRA, yet nevertheless she moved to dismiss, claiming that HSBC did not have standing to bring the servicemember complaint because it had not shown it was the holder of either her mortgage or her note.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-6\">On the basis of supplemental discovery submissions ordered following a hearing on Matt\u2019s motion, the judge denied the motion, concluding that, even though \u201cit is not clear from the record that HSBC is the current holder of either the note or the mortgage,\u201d HSBC nonetheless had standing under the act because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>it had \u201ca contractual right to <em>become </em>[the] holder\u201d of Matt\u2019s mortgage. The judge determined that a plaintiff in a service-member proceeding \u201cneed not be the current holder of the note or the mortgage to have standing .... [I]t is sufficient if the plaintiff satisfies the general requirements of standing.\u201d The judge reasoned that a party with a contractual right to purchase the mortgage has a sufficient interest in the servicemember proceeding because the proceeding \u201caffects the present collect-ability of that loan . . . and thus the present value of the loan.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b216-5\">Matt\u2019s motion for reconsideration was denied, as was her petition for interlocutory review pursuant to G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 118, and her ensuing appeal of that denial. Thereafter, a judgment entered \u201cthat the plaintiff be authorized and empowered] to make an entry and to sell the property covered by the mortgage as set forth in this complaint in accordance with the powers contained in said mortgage.\u201d Matt appealed from this judgment,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and we transferred the case to this court on our own motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-6\">3. <em>Discussion. </em>We review de novo the judge\u2019s determination of the appropriate standard for standing in servicemember proceedings, and his conclusion that HSBC has met this standard. See <em>Indeck Me. Energy, LLC </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Energy Resources, </em>454 Mass. 511, 516 (2009) (\u201cBecause the Superior Court judge decided the standing issue as a matter of law, we review that legal conclusion de novo\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b216-7\">As an initial matter, we consider whether Matt was correctly permitted to appear in this action and to lodge a challenge to HSBC\u2019s standing. The Massachusetts act, as stated, provides that only those defendants who are entitled to the benefits of the SCRA, or those acting on their behalf, \u201cshall be entitled to appear or be heard in [a servicemember] proceeding.\u201d St. 1943, c. 57, \u00a7 1, as amended through St. 1990, c. 496, \u00a7 1. In <em>Beaton, supra </em>at 388, we held that \u201cthe Judges [of the Land Court] acted properly in denying [a] motion to compel the recorder to accept [an] answer\u201d filed by the defendants where \u201cthe answer. . . [did] not assert that the petitioners or any other concerned parties [were] entitled to the protection of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>[SCRA].\u201d See <em>Boston Five Cents Sav. Bank </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>3 Mass. Ct. 790, 790 (1975) (defendants\u2019 appearance and answer properly struck where record did not indicate they were entitled to benefits under SCRA). Because Matt did not assert in her responsive pleading that she was entitled to the protections of the SCRA, the court erred in accepting her filings and allowing her to appear and be heard.</p>\n<p id=\"ali-dedup-0\">The rationale for this limitation lies in the extremely narrow subject matter of the proceeding itself. Simply put, because a servicemember proceeding cannot affect the rights or interests of nonservicemembers, nonservicemembers have no interest in the proceeding. See <em>Beaton, supra </em>at 390-391. \u201c[Cjourts are not established to enable parties to litigate matters in which they have no interest affecting their liberty, rights or property.\u201d See <em>Razin </em>v. Razin, 332 Mass. 754, 754 (1955), quoting <em>Hogarth-Swann </em>v. <em>Weed, </em>274 Mass. 125, 132 (1931). To allow challenges by nonservicemembers, even to threshold issues such as standing, would contravene the clear statutory language and the legislative intent to create a uniquely narrow procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-6\">Notwithstanding a nonservicemember\u2019 s inability under the act to raise the issue, however, a plaintiff must establish standing in order for a court to decide the merits of a dispute or claim. See <em>Beard Motors, Inc. </em>v. <em>Toyota Motor Distribs., Inc., </em>395 Mass. 428, 432 (1985). Because standing is a question of subject matter jurisdiction, <em>Indeck Me. Energy, LLC </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Energy Resources, supra </em>at 516, it must be established irrespective of whether it is challenged by an opposing party. See <em>Nature Church </em>v. <em>Assessors of Belchertown, </em>384 Mass. 811, 812 (1981) (\u201cCourts . . . have both the power and the obligation to resolve problems of subject matter jurisdiction whenever they become apparent, regardless whether the issue is raised by the parties\u201d). See also Mass. R. Civ. R 12 (h) (3), 365 Mass. 754 (1974) (\u201cWhenever it appears by suggestion of a party or otherwise that the court lacks jurisdiction of the subject matter, the court shall dismiss the action\u201d).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AYr\">Therefore, a plaintiff must establish standing in servicemem-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>ber proceedings even if a defendant is statutorily prohibited from appearing. See <em>Bevilacqua </em>v. <em>Rodriquez, </em>460 Mass. 762, 763-764 (2011). If an issue of standing becomes apparent in such cases, it falls to the judge to inquire into the plaintiff\u2019s standing sua sponte. See <em>Nature Church </em>v. <em>Assessors of Belcher-town, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b218-5\">We turn next to whether a plaintiff must be a mortgagee<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> to establish standing in a servicemember proceeding, or whether, as the judge determined, standing may be established upon a showing that a plaintiff holds a right to purchase a mortgage. \u201cTo have standing in any capacity, a litigant must show that the challenged action has caused the litigant injury.\u201d <em>Sullivan </em>v. <em>Chief Justice for Admin. &amp; Mgt. of the Trial Court, </em>448 Mass. 15, 21 (2006), quoting <em>Slama </em>v. <em>Attorney Gen., </em>384 Mass. 620, 624 (1981) \u201c[T]he injury alleged must fall \u2018within the area of concern of the statute or regulatory scheme under which the injurious action has occurred.\u2019 \u201d <em>Sullivan </em>v. <em>Chief Justice for Admin. &amp; Mgt. of the Trial Court, supra </em>at 21-22, quoting <em>Gunther </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Ins., </em>427 Mass. 319, 323 (1998). A plaintiff must have \u201ca definite interest in the matters in contention in the sense that his rights will be significantly affected by a resolution of the contested point.\u201d <em>Bonan </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>398 Mass. 315, 320 (1986). \u201cWe decide whether standing exists by examining several considerations, including the language of the statute [and] the Legislature\u2019s intent and purpose in enacting [it] . . . .\u201d <em>Massachusetts State Police Commissioned Officers Ass\u2019n </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>462 Mass. 219, 223 (2012), quoting <em>Indeck Me. Energy, LLC </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Energy Resources, supra </em>at 517-518.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>A servicemember proceeding is a proceeding in equity brought because of the Federal SCRA and subject to the procedural and subject matter limitations contained in the Massachusetts act. See <em>Lynn Inst. for Sav. </em>v. <em>Taff, </em>314 Mass. 380, 385 (1943). We thus first consider the \u201carea of concern\u201d of the Federal SCRA and the Massachusetts act. The stated purpose of the SCRA is \u201cto provide for, strengthen, and expedite the national defense [through the] temporary suspension of judicial and administrative proceedings and transactions that may adversely affect the civil rights of servicemembers during their military service.\u201d 50 U.S.C. app. \u00a7 502. The SCRA invalidates a foreclosure conducted during a servicemember\u2019s period of military service unless done pursuant to a court order or agreement between the parties. 50 U.S.C. app. \u00a7 533. Because nonmortgagees cannot, by law, take actions to foreclose that would trigger the protections accorded servicemembers by the SCRA, extending standing in servicemember proceedings to nonmortgagees would not further the stated purpose of the SCRA. See <em>Eaton </em>v. <em>Federal Nat\u2019l Mtge. Ass\u2019n, </em>462 Mass. 569, 571 (2012) (party other than mortgagee or agent of mortgagee cannot validly foreclose on mortgage).</p>\n<p id=\"b219-5\">The purpose of this portion of the SCRA, however, is \u201cnot only to protect [servicemember mortgagors], but also to afford relief to mortgagees, who might suffer great loss if compelled to await the termination of the period of military service of any person interested who might be so engaged, before exercising the power of sale.\u201d <em>Lynn Inst. for Sav. </em>v. <em>Taff, supra </em>at 386. Because nonmortgagees are not, by law, in a position to foreclose on a mortgage, see <em>Eaton </em>v. <em>Federal Nat\u2019l Mtge. Ass\u2019n, supra, </em>they could not suffer the loss that the servicemember proceeding redresses. As to foreclosures involving nonservicemember mortgagors, the act contemplates a benefit to mortgagees through the issuance of a judicial decree that such a mortgagor is not entitled to the protections of the SCRA. See <em>Beaton, supra. </em>The decree protects the mortgagee by ensuring that a foreclosure will not subsequently be rendered invalid for failure to provide the protections of the SCRA to anyone so entitled. <em>Id. </em>at 390. Insofar as nonmortgagees are unable to foreclose on a mortgage, the decree affords them no protections.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>Those who, like HSBC, are said to have an option to become the holder of a mortgage do not have the present authority to foreclose. See <em>Eaton </em>v. <em>Federal Nat\u2019l Mtge. Ass\u2019n, supra. </em>Their interest in ascertaining whether the mortgagor is protected under the SCRA is limited to any impact the mortgagor\u2019s service-member status may have upon the present value of the investment they have under consideration. Such an interest does not give rise to a definite injury \u201cwithin the area of concern\u201d of the SCRA, see <em>Sullivan </em>v. <em>Chief Justice for Admin. &amp; Mgt. of the Trial Court, supra </em>at 21-22, nor will a judicial resolution under the act \u201csignificantly affectQ\u201d their rights. See <em>Bonan </em>v. <em>Boston, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b220-5\">Turning to the Massachusetts act, it is clear from its language and history that nonmortgagees likewise do not fall within the act\u2019s \u201carea of concern.\u201d The act sets forth a procedural and substantive framework for servicemember proceedings in order to implement the SCRA. St. 1943, c. 57, \u00a7 1. Section 1 of the act, which imposes a notice requirement, limits the act to proceedings brought \u201cin equity for authority to foreclose a mortgage . . . because of an Act of Congress known as the [SCRA].\u201d <em>Id. </em>The statutory notice form provided thereafter begins:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b220-6\">\u201c[Plaintiff,] <em>claiming to be the holder of a mortgage </em>[or] trust deed [or] security in the nature of a mortgage . . . , has filed with said court a bill in equity for authority <em>to foreclose said mortgage </em>[or] trust deed [or] security in the nature of a mortgage ...\u201d (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b220-7\"><em>Id.</em><footnotemark><em>11</em></footnotemark><em> </em>While largely identical to the notice set forth in the repealed 1941 version of the act, the current notice form contains additional language identifying the plaintiff as one \u201cclaiming to be the holder of a mortgage,\u201d therefore reflecting the legislative <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>intent, see <em>Charles C. </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>415 Mass. 58, 67 n.5 (1993) (amendment to statute properly may be considered as indicative of legislative intent), that only mortgagees bring such complaints. Compare St. 1943, c. 57, with St. 1941, c. 25.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-5\">Finally, the preamble to the initial version of the Massachusetts act states that the servicemember procedure \u201cshould immediately be available for such mortgagees, mortgagors and others1<footnotemark>12</footnotemark>1 so that all future foreclosures in which they are interested may be conducted in accordance with the [SCRA].\u201d St. 1943, c. 57, preamble. From its inception, then, the act contemplated that only mortgagees would have the requisite standing to bring a servicemember complaint. See <em>Brennan </em>v. <em>The Governor, </em>405 Mass. 390, 395 (1989) (\u201cStatements regarding the scope or purpose of an act that appear in its preamble may aid the construction of doubtful clauses . . .\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b221-6\">In light of the foregoing, we conclude that only mortgagees or those acting on behalf of mortgagees<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> have standing to bring servicemember proceedings.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> In the present case, the judge determined that HSBC had standing on the sole basis of its purported right to purchase Matt\u2019s mortgage.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Given the incorrect standard employed in making this determination, neither it nor the ensuing judgment may stand.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b221-7\">Going forward, to establish standing in servicemember <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>proceedings, plaintiffs must present such evidence as may be necessary and appropriate in the circumstances reasonably to satisfy the judge as to their status as mortgagees or agents thereof.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> We emphasize, however, that servicemember proceedings, where nonservicemember defendants may not appear and be heard, are not determinative of any issue beyond the extent of such defendants\u2019 rights under the SCRA, if any. See St. 1943, c. 57. See also Beaton, <em>supra </em>at 390-391. The servicemember proceeding is not part of the foreclosure process. Accordingly, <em>in </em>any separate action challenging a foreclosure or a mortgagee\u2019s right to foreclose,<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> the fact that the purported mortgagee was determined to have standing to maintain a servicemember proceeding does not itself in any way establish the purported mortgagee\u2019s status as such in that separate action.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-10\">4. <em>Conclusion. </em>The judgment for entry and sale is vacated, and the matter is remanded to the Land Court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-13\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b213-6\">The protections of the Federal Servicemembers Civil Relief Act (Federal SCRA or SCRA), 50 U.S.C. app. \u00a7\u00a7 501 et seq.
