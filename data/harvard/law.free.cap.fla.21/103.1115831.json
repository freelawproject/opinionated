Ho plea, answer or demurrer having been filed, the clerk in vacation on the proper rule day, on no other proof than said promissory note, entered judgment that plaintiff \u201c <em>home and recover to, of and from the defendant as administrator of J. 8.

S. A., to be levied of the goods, &amp;c., of the latter, and the court ought not to amend a judgment entered by the clerk when it appears from the record that the clerk ought not to have entered any judgment. The execution commanded the sheriff \u201cthat of the goods, &amp;c., of <em>J. 8. JD., as administrator of the estate of J. 8. A., deceased, </em>you cause to be made \u201d the amount of said judgment and costs. The Circuit Judge, on motion, suspended this execution : <em>Held, </em>That this ruling was right because every execution against an administrator ought to be suspended unless it clearly shows on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>its face whether it is to he satisfied out of the individual property of defendant, or out of the property Of his intestate in his hands' to he. administered.</syllabus>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"history\" id=\"b118-5\">Appeal from the Circuit Court for Duval county.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b118-6\">The facts of the case are stated in the opinion.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b118-7\"><em>G. P. $ J. G. Goober </em>for Appellants.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b118-8\">Th\u00e9 judgment in this case reads against \u201c John S. Driggs, <em>as administrator of the estate of </em>John S. Adams, deceased,\u201d but does not add the words \u201c to be levied of the goods and chattels of decedent.\u201d We contend that this is a valid j udgment against Driggs in his representative capacity as administrator, and that it may be levied on lands, goods, or chattels of said estate of Adams as the property out of which judgment should be made, follows as a matter of law without being recited in the judgment. When judgment reads against a party as administrator of the estate of another, we admit a judgment .against \u201c defendant\u201d simply in such a case would be a personal judgment and could not be made out of the estate, but this is not that sort of case. The only case in which the question of the validity of these judgments has been passed on by this court was in Cooper, Executor, vs. C. O. Livingston, in 19 Fla., page 684, where the court held the judgment erroneous, but upon an inspection of that judgment, page 54'original record in that cause, the court will find that the judgment was simply against \u201c defendant,\u201d not like this judgment, against \u201c Driggs, <em>as administrator </em>of the estate of John S. Adams, deceased.\u201d And such is the distinction to be drawn between all of the cases which decide the form of judgment against administrators ; in all the cases they were not deciding the question presented here, but simply the proper technical form of judgment, without saying that the form here used <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>is absolutely so erroneous as to destroy the face of this judgment as a judgment against the administrators as such, which could be made out of the estate of decedent.</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b119-5\">The eases giving proper form of judgment against administrators, but not deciding on whether a judgment similar to this is sufficient, are the following\u2014all of them are where judgment was rendered simply against defendant, and that are held erroneous: 2 Ind., 123-; 7 Sm. &amp; Mar. (Miss.), 49; 6 Howard, (Miss.,) 93; 3 Hayward, (Tenn.,) 37; 1 How., (Miss.,) 2,74 ; 6 Iowa, 274; 15 Iowa, 23 ; 46 Ala., 66,7.</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b119-6\">But the following'cases decide positively that a judgment against a party <em>as </em>administrator of another is a valid judgment against defendant in his representative capacity, which may be levied of the property of the decedent. Gince, Admr., vs. Sellers <em>et al., </em>43 Miss., 52; 4 Sm. and Mar., (Miss.,) 117 ; 25 Ark., 190 ; 6 How., (Miss.,)93, 351.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b119-7\">There is no sound reason why a judgment in the words of the judgment in this case should not be regarded as a judgment against Briggs in his representative capacity, and not a personal judgment. \u2022</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b119-8\">The purpose of the judgment is but to establish the conclusion of the court as matter of record as to whom the amount is due to, from whom, and the amount; now these are all made perfectly clear by this judgment, no man examining the records would be misled by this judgment; it is plain the amount is - to be made out of Adams\u2019 estate, not out of Briggs personally. This is the form of similar judgments all through the State under which innocent purchasers hold titles, and no such strict technical ruling should be made as was made by the court below. Freeman on Judgments, \u00a7\u00a747, 50, 51, 52.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b119-9\">The next proposition of defendant was that the proceedings anterior to judgment did not sustain a judgment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>against Driggs, as administrator. Our answer to that is, on this sort of application, that the court cannot look back of the judgment; the court cannot try the case over again in this way; all that matter should have been set up as defence.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b120-5\">The Supreme Court of Georgia has construed a similar statutory provision to that of act of 1844, under which defendant here proceeded, and has repeatedly held, you cannot examine the record back of the judgment on this sort of application. \u2022 The case of Emory vs. Smith, 51 Ga., 823, is an identical case in principle and in facts with this, and there the court refused to examine the question, as to whether defendant was\u2019liable individually, in her representative capacity or at all, on motion to stay execution. See 53 Ga., 323 ; 11 Ga., 137 ; 7 Ga., 204; 22 Ga., 570.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b120-6\">But in this case there was nothing for the court to examine to ascertain any facts back of the judgment, because the purported copy of the record exhibited to the court was not certified by any officer, had no mark of authenticity about it, and appears from endorsements thereon to have been some office copy of the transcript of record in this case which went to Supreme Court some two years ago. The court ought not to have entertained it for a moment, but in arriving at his final judgment it influenced him, and he stayed this execution and all proceedings thereunder. See copy record, pages 14 to 25.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b120-7\">We insist that in the common counts of account stated, and money paid by plaintiff for use of defendant as executor, and the allegation in this declaration in this case that Ellen Adams, <em>as </em>executrix, promised to pay, she was only made liable as executrix, and the estate of J. S. Adams was still bound. 3 Williams on Executors, Sec. 1870-71; 23 Maine, 257 ; 7 Taunt., 581; 6 Sm. &amp; Mar., 199 ; 6 Ala., 415.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b121-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>So that an examination of the proceedings back of the judgment would show- enough to support judgment and execution against Driggs as administrator of Adams to he levied of estate of Adams.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b121-5\">We contend lastly that the court erred in overruling appellant\u2019s motion to amend the judgment so as to add the words \u201c to be levied' of the' goods and chattels of J. S.! Adams,\u201d see page 35 of' record. This judgment was clearly intended to be against Driggs, as administrator of Adams, and not personally ; it was a clerical error, if any error at all, to have left out those words in the judgment, and the court should have allowed the amendment. All of the cases in which judgments which should have been <em>de bonis testatoris </em>are entered <em>de bonis </em>propriis, even on appeal, have been ordered amended. 2 Ind., 123 ; 7 Sm. &amp;, Mar., 49 ; 3 Hay w., (Tenn.,) 37 ; 15 Iowa, 23 ; 46 Ala., 667.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b121-6\">Where a judgment is vague in its terms the court will presume it to have been intended in effect as it apparently shows on its face it was meant to be. 4 Ark., 203; 4 Wendell, 623.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b121-7\">In appellee\u2019s brief we notice a disposition to open up for review in this court the question of whether appellant had any action against appellee in first instance. We insist that that question should have been raised on demurrer to declaration, and on motion to vacate stay of execution or to amend judgment this question does not arise, certainly not in the matter staying an execution, and it is from that judgment mainly that this appeal is taken.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b121-8\">We merely made motion to amend as matter of precaution; we really think that the words of judgment are sufficient, now, but omission of words \u201c to be levied of goods, &amp;c., of estate of deceased, &amp;c.,\u201d was but clerical misprison that should be corrected at once by clerk under order of court.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b121-9\"><em>A.

Buckman, Clerk.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b123-9\">On December 15th, 1882, plaintiff moved the court to amend the judgment \u201c so as to have it read and appear of record as against the goods and chattels, lands and tenements of John S. Adams, deceased.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b123-10\">This motion was refused by the court and the plaintiff-excepted.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-11\">On 18th December, 1882, the defendant filed a petition to suspend the execution.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-12\">On January 5th, 1884, the court ordered a final suspenr sion of the execution. To this ruling the plaintiff excepted.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-13\">The case was then brought by writ of error to the Supreme Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-14\">The questions for this court now to decide are\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b124-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>1st. Whether-the Circuit. Court erred in refusing to amend the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-5\">2d. Whether the Circuit Court erred in suspending the execution.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-6\">In considering the question whether the Judge below ought or ought not to have amended the judgment, let us consider what sort of judgment, if any, the clerk ought to have entered on the praecipe, summons, declaration and <em>proof </em>before him.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-7\">The praecipe, summons and declaration were all against \u201c Driggs, administrator of the estate of John S. Adams,\u201d and it would follow that <em>upon proper </em>proof\u25a0 the judgment should have been entered against John.S. Driggs as administrator of the estate of John S. Adams \u201c <em>to be levied of the goods and chattels, lands and tenements of said-John S. Adams in the hands of said Driggs as administrator, to be adminis</em>tered.\u201d 19 Florida, 695, Cooper, Executor of Roberts vs. Livingston.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-8\">But did the <em>proof, </em>filed in this cause, authorize the clerk to enter up a judgment to be binding on the estate of Adams ?</p>\n<p id=\"b124-9\">If the proof authorized the clerk to enter such a judgment, then he ought to have done so, and if there was an informality in the judgment which the clerk <em>ought </em>to have entered, the court ought, on motion, to have amended it, (15 Fla., 198,) but if on the <em>proof </em>the clerk ought <em>not </em>to have entered a judgment binding on the estate of Adams, then the court below ought not to have done that which the clerk ought not to have done. A court should never lend its aid in perfecting an error which the clerk started to commit. The court will only lend its aid when the clerk has started to enter a <em>correct, </em>judgment and has committed an informality in the entry.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-10\">The question recurs, would the clerk have done right, on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>the proof before him, in entering a judgment against the estate of John S. Adams.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-5\">The only proof before the clerk was a note signed \u201c Ellen F. Adams, executrix of the estate of John S. Adams.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b125-6\">Our rule of court, number 4, requires every promissory note sued on to be filed with the declaration. The original of the note filed with the declaration in this case was the only proof or paper which was produced and filed when the judgment was rendered.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-7\">Our statute, chapter 1938, sec. 7, declares that upon the entry of a default, in any suit for the recovery of money, <em>founded upon </em>contract, and the action is on a <em>written instrument for the payment of </em>money, the plaintiff, at any time after such default, may, on the production and filing of such instrument, cause final judgment to be entered for the amount thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-8\"><em>We </em>take it that this language relates only to cases in which the suit is founded on a contract between the parties to the suit or the persons they represent, and where the action is on a written instrument for the payment of money by the defendant, or the person he represents, to the plaintiff or the person he represents. If this be not the meaning of said section 7, then A. may sue B. on the note of 0., and on default cause the clerk to enter judgment against B.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-9\">The note sued on this case was not signed by J. S. Adams, nor by Driggs, the defendant. This is a note signed by \u201c Ellen F. Adams, executrix of the estate of J. S. Adams,\u201d by which she, for value received, promised to pay Higgins or order on demand $1,097, at the rate of ten per \u25a0 cent, per annum.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-10\">Did this note bind the estate of J. 8. Adams ? or was it .the note only of Ellen F. Adams individually? It does not appear, except from the note itself, whether the consideration of it was an indebtedness of J. 8. Adams to Hig<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>gins, or an indebtedness of' Ellen E. Adams individually. She says in the note \u201c for value received, I promise to pay,\u201d &amp;c. She may have borrowed money from Higgins for her individual uses and have given this note for it. The inference from the face of the note is that <em>she </em>received the value, and for the value so received gave the note.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-5\">\"We are of opinion that this note does not bind the estate of J. S. Adams.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-6\">Mr. Daniel, in his work on negotiable instruments, section 292, declares the law to be as follows: \u201c An administrator or executor <em>cannot </em>bind the decedent\u2019s estate by any negotiable instrument. If he make, accept or endorse any negotiable instrument, he will bind himself personally, even if he adds to his own name the designation of his office as personal representative. Thus, if he signs himself \u201cA. B., executor, (or administrator) of 0., or A. B. <em>as </em>executor of C., the representative terms will be rejected as surplus-age.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b126-7\">Mr. Daniel cites a great number of authorities to sustain the law as thus laid down, and we hold that he has laid the law down correctly.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-8\">Therefore, since Ellen P. Adams, executrix of J. S. Adams, by signing the aforesaid note, even though she added after her name the words \u201c executrix of the estate of J. S. Adams,\u201d did not bind the estate of John S. Adams, and since Driggs did not sign the note, it was wrong for the clerk, on such proof, to enter a judgment binding either Driggs personally or the estate of J. S. Adams.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-9\">And if the clerk should not have entered any judgment at all on such proof, either against Driggs personally or against the estate of J. S. Adams, surely the Circuit Judge did not err in.refusing to amend the judgment so as to make it binding on the estate of J. S. Adams, as asked for by the plaintiff. Eor, as we have before said, the court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>should never lend its aid to perfect an error which the clerk started to commit but did not complete. It will only lend its aid when the clerk has started to enter a correct judgmant but has committed an informality in the entry.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-5\">We are of opinion that the Circuit Court did not err in refusing to amend the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-6\">The remaining question is whether the Circuit Court erred in staying the execution.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-7\">Every writ purporting to be an execution ought to be suspended on application to the court, unless it shows clearly on its face out of whose property it is to be satisfied, for it is not proper to leave the sheriff in doubt on that subject, as it is unlawful for him to levy on the property of any one except by the express command of the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-8\">This execution commands the sheriff to satisfy it, not out of the property of <em>Adams </em>in the hands of Driggs to be administered, but out of the property of <em>Driggs as administrator of Adams.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b127-9\">If it was the intention of the clerk who issued this execution that it should be satisfied out of the property of Adams, why did he not issue it in the common form which has been in use for ages, \u201cto be levied of the goods and chattels, lands and tenements of Adams in the hands of Driggs to be administered ?\u201d On the contrary, if theclerk intended that this execution should be satisfied out of the property of Driggs, why did he not follow the usual form in such cases? We are left in doubt as,to the meaning of this execution. We have found in the books several <em>judgments </em>rendered against <em>UC. D.'as administrator of A. B.f </em>and then stopping without saying out of whose property they should be paid, but from these judgments, as far as we can learn, executions were issued in the usual form to be levied of the prop<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>erty of deceased. But the only <em>execution </em>we have found that does not order out of whose property it is to be satisfied is found in 51 Georgia, 483, Tinsley vs. Lee. That execution is substantially the same as the one under consideration, as appears from the following copy of- it, to wit:</p>\n<p id=\"b128-5\">\u201cWe command you of the goods and chattels, lands and tenements of Thomas W. Howell, <em>executor of William Tins</em>ley, deceased, that you cause to be made the sum of $238.85, principal, and the further sum of $48.23, interest and costs, which the plaintiff' lately recovered against said Thomas Howell, <em>executor of William </em>Tinsley, <em>deceased.\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b128-6\">The Supreme Court of Georgia decided that this was an execution against the individual property of Thomas Howell, saying: \u201c The addition of executor to his name without more, did not prevent the decree from binding his personal goods and chattels.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b128-7\">It is contended that the judgment rendered by the clerk, in the case under consideration, because it is against the defendant in his representative capacity, is equivalent to a judgment against the goods and estate of the intestate, and that this execution following the judgment is therefore good.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-8\">We answer that if this were so, the court below ought to have amended the judgment so as to put the matter beyond doubt. But we deny that such is the legal effect of the judgment. In the case of Hardy vs. Call, 16 Mass., 530, the court said : \u201c The judgment having been exhibited to us for inspection, we find that it was rendered against the defendant <em>in his capacity as administrator. </em>It has been argued that this is equivalent to a judgment against the goods and chattels of the intestate. But we think otherwise ; * * * it is very clear that no judgment has been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>\u25a0rendered against the goods and estate of Palmer, the intestate,\u201d &amp;e.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-5\">We have found several cases, however, in which judgments rendered like the one under consideration have been held sufficient, to sustain executions against the property of the intestate, but on examination of all such judgments, it will be found that the judgments, as shown by the record, were based on <em>some liability of the decedent. </em>In such cases the courts either amended the judgments, or else considered that as done which ought to have been done, and so sustained the executions. We have a striking illustration of this in 25 Ark.., 190, in case of Stone, Adm\u2019x vs. Kaufman, where the jugdment was \u201cthat plaintiff have and recover of and from the <em>defendant </em>\u201d '(without adding the word \u201c administrator.\u201d) Yet the court held that this was a valid judgment against defendant \u201c as administratrix of Jefferson Stone in her representative capacity.\u201d And why did the court make so strange a ruling ? Because in looking back of the judgment they found that the suit was instituted against her as administratrix of Jefferson Stone <em>on a written instrument made by him in his life time.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b129-6\">When we look behind the judgment in the case under consideration, we find that the judgment is <em>not </em>based on any evidence of the indebtedness of the decedent, John S. Adams, but only on evidence of the indebtedness of Ellen E. Adams.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-7\">We cannot, therefore, reach the conclusion that there ought to have been a judgment against Driggs either out of his own estate, or out of the estate of John S. Adams.</p>\n<p id=\"AZ0\">We have a second illustration in the case of Grice, Administrator, vs. Sellers and wife, 43 Miss., 52, in which the court said: \u201c Grice was sued as administrator, and the recovery was .against him in that capacity. Execution <em>de bonis propriis </em>could not emanate on this judgment. It <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>would have followed the line of safe precedents, and we would by no means encourage a departui\u2019e from it, to have added \u2018 to be levied of the goods and chattels of his intestate, ET. Kennison, in his hands to be administered,\u2019 but the judgment being against him <em>as </em>administrator, necessarily on such judgment the execution must go out against him as administrator, and be satisfied of the goods of the intestate.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b130-5\">The Mississippi Supreme Court, going behind the judgment in this case, found that Grice was sued as administrator, <em>on a note given by Ms intestate </em>and <em>therefore </em>concluded the judgment ought to be satisfied out of the estate of the intestate.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-6\">We think if that court had found that the judgment was <em>not </em>based on any indebtedness of the intestate, it would never have concluded that it should be paid out of the estate of the intestate. If the Supreme Court of Mississippi meant to say that every judgment against the defendant as administrator must, <em>under all circumstances, </em>be satisfied out of the estate of the decedent, we must respectfully differ from it.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-7\">We know that judgments are often rendered against defendants as administrators to be satisfied, sometimes <em>de bonis testatoris, </em>at other times <em>de bonis testatoris </em>as to the debt and <em>de bonis propriis </em>as to the costs, and sometimes <em>de bonis testatoris </em>when assets of deceased shall come to the hands of the administrator, &amp;c.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-8\">And if the suit on this note had been against Ellen E. Adams, as administratrix, the judgment might have been entered against her to be satisfied <em>de bonis propriis, </em>the words \u201c as administrator being rejected as surplusage \u201d in the judgment as in the note sued on.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-9\">\u25a0 We have a third illustration in the case of Neely <em>et ux., </em>Administrator and Administratrix, vs. The Planter\u2019s Bank. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>In this case of Neely vs. The Bank, the judgment was that plaintiff\u2019s recover from <em>defendants, administrator and administratrix of deceased. </em>It was held by the court, (4 S. &amp; M.,) that the judgment was not against the defendants <em>individually, </em>but in their representative capacity. But why did the court thus hold ? Because by going back of the judgment they found that the suit was brought against defendants in their representative capacity, and the cause of action was\u2019a promissory <em>note endorsed by the decedent.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b131-5\">But in the ease of Higgins vs. Driggs, under consideration, the cause of action was <em>not </em>a note endorsed either by decedent or by Driggs, but was a note of Ellen E. Adams, for the. payment of which neither the estate of Adams, nor Driggs, was bound, so far at least as is disclosed by the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-6\">In conclusion, we are of opinion that whenever an execution, like the one under'consideration, or any execution against an administrator which does not show out of whose property it is to be satisfied, is presented to the court, on application to stay it the court should suspend it until the judgment on which it issued can be inspected.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-7\">If, on inspection of the judgment, the court finds that the execution can be amended from it, then the amendment should made.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-8\">But \u25a0 if, on inspection of the judgment, the court finds that the execution cannot be amended from it, then the court should continue the suspension of the execution until opportunity be given to amend the judgment by inspection of the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-9\">If, on inspection of the record, the judgment cannot be amended by it, then the court should grant a final judgment staying the execution.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>Such was the course pursued by the Circuit Court in the case under consideration. We find no error in its judgment. It is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
