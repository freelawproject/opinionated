Grimes and Daniel Grimes, her husband, tendered to the said A. R. Shirk a deed, sufficient and correct in form, for the above described premises and demanded the purchase money, fifteen hundred dollars ($1,500), according to the agreement, which the said A. R. Shirk declined and refused to pay, admitting that the deed was sufficient in form, but averring that under the will of Francis Bright, the estate of the said Hester A. Grimes in said property was a life estate, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>and not a fee simple, and that she and her husband could not make a legal conveyance in fee simple, of the said premises.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b96-5\"><em>\u201c4. </em>If the court shall be of the opinion that under said item of the said will of the said Francis Bright, the estate devised to Hester A.

Grimes takes and has under this will but a life estate. Certain rules have been stated, which may aid us in arriving at a correct conclusion.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b96-9\">\u201c The first to which we shall refer is the rule in Shelley\u2019s Case : 1 Rep. 104, A. (Coke).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b96-10\">\u201c \u20181. When the ancestor by any gift or conveyance takes an estate of freehold, and in the same gift or conveyance an estate is limited, either mediately or immediately, to his heirs in fee, or in tail, \u201cthe heirs \u201d are words in limitation of the estate, and not words of purchase.\u2019</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b96-11\">\u201c This rule in Shelley\u2019s case is a rule of law, and not simply of construction, and where the language used in the instrument brings the case within the rule, the fact that it was the intention of the grantor, or devisor, that the rule should not operate, is of no importance: Fearne on Contingent Rem., 188; 2 Jar. on Wills (5 Am. ed.), 332; Hileman v. Bouslaugh, 13 Pa. 344; Kleppner v. Laverty, 70 Pa. 70; List v. Rodney, 83 Pa. 483; Rummell v. Dilworth, 111 Pa. 344.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b96-12\">\u201c And so imperative is the rule that, although there be an express declaration that the ancestor shall only take and have a life estate, yet this expressed intention will not defeat its operation : 2 Washb. Real Prop. 5th ed. 652; Harvey v. Schuyler, 11 Am. State Rep. 92.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b97-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>\u201c \u2018 2. The word \u201c issue \u201d standing alone in a will, that is, without some unequivocal contrary intent apparent is to be taken as a word of limitation, similiar in import with \u201c heirs of the body,\u201d and if an estate be limited to a man and his issue, he will take an estate tail, which, if the will goes into effect, since the date of the act of April 27, 1855, will be turned into a fee simple.\u2019</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b97-5\">\u201c It would, therefore, seem on principle at least, that as \u2018 issue \u2019 prima facie is a word of limitation, synonymous with \u2018 heirs of the body,\u2019 that, until this prima facie meaning is rebutted, it should be subject to the rules of law in precisely the same manner.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b97-6\">\u201c 3. Where an estate is limited to the ancestor for life, remainder to his issue, and the word issue is construed to be a word of limitation, the estate limited to the issue will vest in the ancestor, and he will take an estate tail by force of the rule in Shelley\u2019s case, or by analogy to it. A condition necessarily implied will have no effect in restraining the meaning of the word, or the force of the rule. But, although presumptively issue is a word of limitation, that presumption may be rebutted by words showing a contrary lawful intent; but such words must be unequivocal, and there are many such which at first sight would seem to be sufficiently unequivocal, but which have been adjudged not to be so; for instance, words of distributive-modification have not been held to be conclusive, though they clearly indicate an intention on the part of the testator that the issue should take in a manner entirely inconsistent with the course of devolution in an estate tail, as we shall see when we come to refer to decisions in which this rule, or point, has been raised.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b97-7\">\u201c4. Where the gift to the issue is accompanied by words of distributive modification. While this is a strong indication of an intent to give an estate to the issue by purchase, it is not sufficiently strong to overcome the prima facie meaning of the word; and this is true, where the gift to the issue is in fee or in tail.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b97-8\">\u201c 5. Where superadded words of limitation and of distributive modification both annexed to the devise to the issue, will be sufficient to show that the intent of the testator was that the issue should not take through the ancestor, but that a new line <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>of descent should commence with them. They will therefore take as purchasers in fee or in tail.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b98-5\">\u201c 6. Where the devise over is limited on a dying without leaving issue \u2014 these words import an indefinite failure of issue \u2014though if the estate of the ulterior devisee is for life, or before the act of 1833, indefinite, the failure will necessarily be restricted to the lifetime.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b98-6\">\u201c There are other rules to which we might refer, as where the word issue, and children, are used interchangeably. Where there is a devise over on failure of issue living, etc., etc., but as they do not appear to apply to the case before us, we omit them.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b98-7\">\u201c The words in this will which we are to consider and construe, are: \u2018 I give and devise unto my adopted daughter, Hester A. Grimes, . . . .; to have and to hold the said several messuages, lots and pieces of ground, with the appurtenances, for and during the term of her natural life. And, after the death of my said adopted daughter, Hester Ann Grimes, I give and devise the reversion or remainder of the real estate herein devised to her, to her lawful issue, to have and to hold the same in common to them, their heirs and assigns forever. And in case the said Hester should die without leaving lawful issue, then the aforesaid real estate shall revert to my estate, and I give and devise the same to my heirs under the intestate laws of the commonwealth of Pennsylvania.\u2019</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b98-8\">\u201c \u2018 To her lawful issue, their heirs and assigns forever.\u2019</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b98-9\">\u201c The word \u2018issue,\u2019 besides being in common parlance a word of more than one meaning, has also been the subject o&amp; much doubt and discussion as regards its legal signification; some of the judges being of the opinion that it was an apt word of limitation, Avhile others were of opinion that it was presumptively a word of purchase; but the Aveight of authority being greatly against this last position, it has generally been abandoned.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b98-10\">\u201c This is shown by the language of Judge Strong, in Angle v. Brosius, 43 Pa. 187, where he says: \u2018The Avord \u201cissue\u201d is well adapted for a word of limitation, having much more aptitude for such a use, than it has to designate the objects of a gift. In signification it very nearly resembles the technical phrase, \u201c heirs of the body,\u201d and indeed, the two were used as synonyms in the Statute De Donis. Hence, it has long been settled that where real estate is devised by one or more limitations, in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>same will to a person and his issue, the word \u201c issue \u201d will be construed as a word of limitation, so as to give the ancestor an estate tail, unless there are expressions in the will unequivocally indicative of a contrary intention.\u2019</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b99-5\">\u201c The case of Paxson v. Lefferts, 3 Rawle, 59, is a fair example of the application of the rule. The devise in that case was \u2018 to A for life, and if he leave issue, to them in fee,\u2019 and a devise over on failure of such issue. The devise over had no effect whatever, as it, being on failure \u2018of such\u2019 issue, was equally applicable to the contingency of the lack of issue, or their extinction. The ancestor was held to take an estate tail, and it was expressly decided that the devise was not without the rule in Shelley\u2019s case.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b99-6\">\u201c Kleppner v. Laverty, 70 Pa. 70, was almost identical with the last case cited. The devise was : \u2018To A, during her natural life, upon the happening of her death, to her lawful issue, should she leave any.\u2019 In default of such \u2018 lawful issue, over/ the rule in Shelley\u2019s case was held to apply.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b99-7\">\u201c In Hoff\u2019s Est., 147 Pa. 636, the testator provided \u2018 in case either of my daughters shall die without issue, either before, or after the decease of my wife, then the amount of their share or shares in the residue of the estate shall revert back to the remainder of my children, share and share alike; my said sons .... and my daughter .... are to hold in trust, the share or shares that such of my daughters as may be without issue, before or after the death of my wife, may be entitled to and invest their legacies in bonds, and pay to them the interest thereon semi-annually.\u2019</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b99-8\">\u201c It was held on the authority of Eichelberger v. Barnitz, and the line of cases following that decision, that the words \u2018 shall die without issue,\u2019 must be construed to mean an indefinite failure of issue, and hence, that the legatee took an absolute estate in the fee. See also, Vaughan v. Dickens, 20 Pa. 509,-Eichelberger v. Barnitz, 9 Watts, <em>447; </em>Amelia Smith\u2019s App., 23 Pa. 9.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b99-9\">\u201cIn Lawrence v. Lawrence, 105 Pa. 339, Mr. Justice TuttnKEY held that the established interpretation of words of limitation on failure of issue, where the terms were, \u2018if he die without issue,\u2019 in the absence of all words making a different intent apparent, is that these import a generally indefinite fail<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>ure of issue, and not a failure at the first taker\u2019s death. See 2 Jann. on Wills, 497.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b100-5\">\u201c In Hackney v. Tracy, 137 Pa. 53, Green, J., says: \u2018 In one of our most recent cases, Reinoehl v. Shirk, 119 Pa. 108, our brother Sterrett, in delivering the opinion of the court, said, \u201cStanding alone, therefore, the words \u2018die without leaving issue,\u2019 and other expressions of the same import, mean an indefinite failure of issue : Taylor v. Taylor, 63 Pa. 481; Middleswarth v. Blackmore, 74 Pa. 414; At common law, in the absence of words making a different intent apparent, the established interpretation of such expressions in a will is that they import a general indefinite failure of issue, and not a failure at the death of the first taker; and such has undoubtedly been the rule in this state, since Eichelberger v. Barnitz, 9 Watts, 447.\u201d \u2019 See also, Reinoehl v. Shirk, 119 Pa. 108; Taylor v. Taylor, 63 Pa. 481; Middleswarth v. Blackmore, 74 Pa. 414; Lapsley v. Lapsley, 9 Pa. 130; Matlack v. Roberts, 54 Pa. 148.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b100-6\">\u201cThe defendant contends, that as the testator, after giving a life estate to Hester Ann Grimes, and giving the remainder to her lawful issue, provides how they shall hold it, (in common) and adds words of limitation to the issue, showing that he intended the issue to take a title in fee simple, and to hold the same in common, this gives a title to the lawful issue by purchase, and not by descent, and makes the estate of, Hester Ann Grimes, a life estate and not an estate in fee tail, which under the act of 1855, would be an estate in fee simple, and ref\u00e9rs to Hawkins on Wills, 191, where it is said, the rule is \u2018 when there is a devise to one for life, with remainder to his issue, as tenants in common, with a limitation to the heirs general of the issue, the issue take as purchaser in fee,\u2019 citing: Findlay v. Riddle, 3 Binn. 139, \u2018 where the devise was to A. during his natural life, and after his decease, if he shall die leaving issue, to his heirs as tenants in common, and their respective heirs and assigns forever.\u2019 By the devise over, \u2014 \u2018 But, in case he shall die without leaving lawful issue,\u2019 etc. \u2014 it was held that A took a life estate.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b100-7\">\u201c In Powell v. Board of Missions, 49 Pa. 46, the devise was, \u2018 to A for his natural life, and after his 'decease, if he shall die leaving lawful issue, to such issue, if one in fee, if more than one, to be equally divided in fee. The devise over, \u2014 But, if <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>A should die without lawful issue, then over, \u2014 held that A took a life estate.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b101-5\">\u201c In Robbins v. Quinliven, 79 Pa. 333, the devise was to \u2018 A for her natural life, and after her death, to her issue and their heirs forever; in the proportions to which they would be entitled, under the intestate laws of- Pennsylvania.\u2019 There was no devise over \u2014 it was held that A took a life estate.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b101-6\">\u201c In O\u2019Rouke v. Sherwin, 156 Pa. 285, it is said, the word \u2018 issue \u2019 in a will, prima facie means \u2018 heirs of the body,\u2019 and in the absence of explanatory words, showing that it was used in a restricted sense, is to be construed as a word of limitation, but, if there be on the face of the will sufficient to show that the word was intended to have a less extended meaning, and to be applied only to children, or to decedents of a particular class, or at a particular time, it is to be construed as a word of purchase, and not of limitation, in order to effectuate the intention of the testator.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b101-7\">\u201c There are some other cases of this same class which might be referred to, but, as we have seen, cases of this class are generally decided upon some clause of the will containing the devise, which indicates the intention of the testator to have been, that the heirs should not take by descent, but as a purchaser.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b101-8\">\u201c The rule in Shelley\u2019s case is a rule of law, and not of construction. Where the language used in the instrument brings the case within the rule, the fact that it was the intention of the grantor or devisor, that the rule should not operate is of no importance: Fearne on Contingent Rem. 188; Hayes\u2019 Real Est., 95; Hileman v. Bouslaugh, 13 Pa. 344; List v. Rodney, 83 Pa. 483; Kleppner v. Laverty, 70 Pa. 70.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b101-9\">\u201c So imperative is the rule that, though there be an express declaration that the ancestor shall only have a life estate, yet this expressed intention will not defeat its operation. This principle has unfortunately been more than once overlooked, some cases regarding the rule as merely one of construction, yielding to the manifest intention of the testator. Among these are Findlay v. Riddle, and the cases above referred to as following it: 2 Washb. Real Prop. 5th ed. 652; Doebler\u2019s App., . 64 Pa. 9; Marburg v. Cole, 49 Md. 406.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b101-10\">\u201cIn Findlay v. Riddle, supra, cited in 22 Am. &amp; Eng. Ency. of Law, 501, the court seemed to lean strongly against apply<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>ing the rule when the intention that the first taker should have only a life estate was perfectly plain. But the Pennsylvania courts have since unhesitatingly applied the rule regardless of the intention, when the subsequent limitation was to heirs, qua heirs.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b102-5\">\u201c The proper rule or method of applying the rule in Shelley\u2019s case is said to be this : \u2018 Interpret the deed or will, by the ordinary rules of construction, precisely as if this rule had no existence.\u2019 Then having ascertained the testator\u2019s intention, look at this rule and see whether such intention conflicts with it, if it does, the rule must be applied, for it is absolute and has no exception.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b102-6\">\u201c In Crockett v. Robinson, 46 N. H. 454, the devise was, to J. and C. to be equally divided between them, and their heirs, if they have any lawful heirs at the time of their decease ; and if they have no lawful heirs at the time of their decease, to be equally divided between the children of a sister of J. and C. .... Having interpreted the will, the court then applied the rule in Sliellej-\u2019s case and held that J. and C. took estates tail, which by the statute of New Hampshire abolishing estates tail, were turned into fee simple.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b102-7\">\u201cWords of distributive modification, or the words tenants in common, have not been held conclusive, though they clearly indicate an intention, on the part of the testator, that the issue should take in a manner wholly inconsistent with the course of devolution in an estate tail. The cases in which this point has arisen are numerous, but as the decisions have been but one way, we shall refer to but a few of them :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b102-8\">\u201c In Curtis v. Longstreth, 44 Pa. 297, the devise in chief was to A for his natural life, without power of sale, and at his death to his heirs as tenants in common. The devise over was, \u2018 should he die without issue,\u2019 then over. The judgment was, that A took an estate tail.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b102-9\">\u201cIn Haldeman v. Haldeman, 40 Pa. 30, the devise in chief was, \u2018 To A,B and C, (in trust) during their natural lives, and after the death of either of them, to descend and go to the child, and if children, share and share alike.\u2019 The devise over, \u2018 should, however, either of them die and leave no lawful issue, then such share to fall to the residue of the estate.\u2019 The judgment was, that A, B and C took estates tail.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b103-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>\u201cIn Ogden\u2019s App., 70 Pa. 501, the doctrine in Pennsylvania is very clearly stated by Justice Agnew, in his opinion he says in speaking of the phrase : \u2018 To her lawful issue.\u2019 (The words used in the devise in the present case.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b103-5\">\u201c It requires more than mere words of distribution to limit this prima facie effect of the phrase.

The presumption that words of limitation in a will are used in their ordinary legal sense, is not to he overcome by other words, merely incongruous with such intention, and if an estate to heirs be given as an immediate remainder after the freehold, it vests as an executed estate of inheritance in the ancestor, and the testator cannot prevent this legal consequence by any declaration of a prior intention, however plain. The opinion in-this case was delivered by Mr. Justice Sharswood. The devise was to the son, with the reservation \u2018 but he shall in nowise sell or alienate any of the property, as it is intended he shall have a life interest only in the same, with remainder over to his heirs in fee, and he shall in no wise come into possession until his tweuty-second year.\u2019 The learned justice said, that, where the testator devised his mansion house and the adjoining lot to his son, the plaintiff, for life, with remainder over to his heirs in fee, \u2018 it would require a very clear indication of an intention on his part to use the word \u201c heirs \u201d in some other than its well-ascertained legal sense to justify a court in departing from it.\u2019</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"91\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b109-6\">\u201c From a review of the law, as stated in the foregoing decisions, and adhering to the ordinary rules of construction, we see no reason to doubt that the testator, Francis Bright, by the words \u2018lawful issue \u2019 meant the lineal descendants of his adopted daughter, Hester A. Grimes, and not her collateral heirs. The very terms of the wall by which he provides, that in the event of failure of issue on her part, the remainder shall revert to his estate, indicates clearly, that by \u2018lawful issue,\u2019 he intended and meant, to preserve the estate in the first taker and her lawful <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>heirs. The words \u2018in common \u2019 are not such superadded words of limitation, or distributive modification, as will make the words \u2018 lawful issue \u2019 words of purchase.
