Price, while both were living, and Mr. Price was acting as the attorne}1- in fact of said William Meredith, duly appointed by letter of attorney dated the 6th day of August, 1841, which was produced, there are entries showing the dividends declared and those paid by Mr. Price and by Mr. Meredith.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b277-9\">\u201c Upon the death of Mr. William Meredith, which occurred about Sept. 26,1844, the executors named in his will having <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>all renounced, letters of administration d. b. n. c. t. a. on the estate of said William Meredith were granted to the said Eli K.

Price, of Philadelphia, and John Ferguson, of New York, were, on the 28th day of December, 1844, duly appointed trustees under said deed of assignment, in the place and stead of William Meredith, deceased, and John Day, discharged.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b278-7\">\u201cAfter the appointment of Eli K. Price and John Ferguson, they struck five several dividends from the funds arising from said assigned estate upon all the claims thereon, and paid all of said dividends excepting those included in the schedule of unclaimed dividends hereinafter referred to and included in such payments, the dividends on the claims stated to have been purchased by William Meredith, and also those stated to have been purchased by Maurice Wurts and William Wurts, the receipts for which dividends were produced before your auditor, so that the fund contained in the present account was derived wholly from unclaimed dividends on claims of creditors who never appeared or made any claim upon any of the trustees under this deed of assignment.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b278-8\">\u201c The said John Ferguson appears to have died after the declaration of these dividends by Mr. Price and Mr. Ferguson, and the present account hereto annexed is filed by the executors of Mr. Price, who is stated therein as the surviving trustee, though no account appears to have been filed of record by Day and Meredith or either of them.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b278-9\">\u201c In the year 1867 Eli K. Price, as administrator d. b. n. c. t. a. of William Meredith, deceased, filed his sixth account, and the same was referred by the orphans\u2019 court of this county to John Clayton, Esq., to audit, settle and adjust and to report distribution. Mr. Clayton\u2019s report shows that in this account <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>there was included $3,000 of Philadelphia City Six Per Cent Loan and Interest received thereon from time to time, amounting to $2,697 (together $5,997), and that this fund arose from unclaimed dividends in the hands of William Meredith at the time of his decease belonging to certain -creditors of M. and W. Wurts, who could not be found, and that Mr. Peter McCall, representing the heirs of said William Meredith, contended that this money in the hands of Mr. Meredith at his death liad no earmark and was not to be distinguished from the residue of his assets, and that his estate was merely indebted to the creditors in question of M. and W. Wurts, and that upon their failure to establish their claims, this fund with its accumulations should be distributed to and among Mr. Meredith\u2019s heirs and next of kin. The auditor ruled and so reported that the said investment and the accrued interest thereon had no place among the assets of the testator, and should be struck out of said account and said sum of $5,697 be held by Mr. Price in his capacity of trustee for the creditors of M. and W. Wurts for the unpaid creditors, or, in the event of their not being reached, then for the benefit of the original assignors or their representatives. This report of Mr. Clayton as auditor, there appearing no exception thereto, was confirmed absolutely by the orphans\u2019 court on Sept. 20, 1867.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b279-5\">\u201c There appears upon the book above referred to, kept by Mr. Meredith and turned over by him to Mr. Price, sundry accounts of the trust estate wherein dividends were struck in favor of the respective creditors by name, the greater part of which appears to have been paid, but certain of them have never been paid to or claimed by the creditors to whom they were awarded. . . .</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b279-6\">\u201cNo formal proof of the fact was produced before your auditor, but it appears to have been conceded that the said William Meredith in his lifetime purchased the claims of some of these creditors, and paid to himself or retained for his own use the dividends awarded on the claims, and to his appropriation of such dividends no objection seems to have ever been made.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b279-7\">\u201c It also appeared that the assignors had purchased the claims of certain creditors and, through their attorney, Charles S.

Mr. S. Davis Page, who is the administrator, d. b. n. c. t. a., of William Wurts, deceased, who was the surviving partner of the said firm of Maurice Wurts &amp; Company, the assignors, who appeared in his own behalf and by his said counsel, and claimed the whole balance of said fund under and by virtue of the express terms of the deed of assignment. Robert Ralston and Francis W. Ralston, Jr., who are the administrators, d. b. n. c. t. a., of William Meredith, deceased', who were represented by Lewis Lawrence Smith, Esq., and Caldwell K. Biddle, Esq., and who also claim the whole of said balance of said fund, on the ground that they represent the only parties holding claims under said assignment, who appeared before the auditor. Both the said administrator of William Wurts and the administrators of William Meredith produced to the auditor their respective letters of administration.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b280-6\">\u201c The counsel for the respective claimants presented to the auditor both oral and written arguments, and with the consent and approval of said counsel your auditor has concluded to attach their briefs to this report for the information of your honorable court. ...</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b280-7\">\u201c The case of Est. of Potter &amp; Page, 54 Pa.

It was awarded by the learned court below to the administrator of William Wurts who was the surviving assignor. The award or decree so made is contested on this appeal by the administrators of William Meredith on whom the active duties of the trust devolved. From 1819 to 1844 Meredith had the exclusive management of the estate. He died in September, 1844, and Eli K. Price became his administrator and also a trustee under the deed of assignment. No account of his administration of the trust was filed by Meredith but he made and preserved memoranda showing what he did in execution of it. From these it appears that he \u201c paid to himself or retained for his own use \u201d the dividends on certain claims standing in the names of parties who were creditors of the assignors. It also appears from memoranda made by and from books and papers in the possession of Price, that he, as trustee of the assigned estate, paid to himself as Meredith\u2019s administrator all the dividends subsequently appropriated to these claims. There is no direct evidence of a sale of the claims to Meredith but his legal representatives contend that his action and the action of his administrator in reference to the payment of dividends upon them authorize and support an inference or presumption that he purchased them while he was trustee. That Price retained the dividends in the belief that the claims on which they were awarded belonged to Meredith\u2019s estate is manifest from the recitals in his receipts for the same, but upon what information his belief wa's based does not appear. If Meredith bought the claims and they were assigned to him it is reasonable to suppose that he would have preserved the evidences of his title to them. Price was the administrator of his estate and entitled to the possession of the books and papers pertaining to the ownership of the assets he was called to administer, and such of them as were applicable to the issues in this distribution were accessible to the appellants. Their failure to produce any evidence of an assignment of the claims to Meredith other than the appropriation of the dividends by him and his estate compels them to rest their pres-en! contention on the presumption arising from such appropri* <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>ation. A presumption that he purchased the claims for his personal benefit would contain an imputation of dishonesty in the administration of the trust. The law condemns speculation by the assignee in the debts of his assignors, and will not allow him to appropriate the profits of it. If Meredith bought the claims in question and the parties from whom he purchased were satisfied with their sale of them, whatever he made by the transaction inured to the benefit of the trust estate. He certainly could not recover from the estate in the form of dividends on the claims more than he paid for them, and this was presumably less than the dividends applicable to them. All of these dividends having been received by him or his estate it would seem that something more than the mere appropriation of them was necessary to give his representatives a legal or equitable standing in this contest. But we do not rest our affirmance of the decree on this ground alone. It appears to be in harmony with and sustained by the provisions of the assignment in reference to distribution. \u2022</p>\n<p id=\"b288-5\">The trust deed shows that it was the intention of the assignors that each of their creditors should accept in full satisfaction of his claim his proportionate share of whatever sum might be realized from the assigned effects, and that the share of any creditor refusing to so accept it within the time prescribed should revert to them. The. share of each creditor was ascertainable on the basis of the whole indebtedness and therefore the share of a releasing creditor was not affected by the refusal of another creditor to comply with the conditions on which the right to a share depended. A releasing creditor who has received his proportionate share of the sum realized from the assets has no further interest in that sum. His receipt of the share which his compliance with the provisions of the deed gave him extinguished his interest in it and satisfied his claim. It appears to be conceded that the shares of the creditors were correctly ascertained and that the dividends awarded to them have exhausted the assigned estate. As each creditor was the exclusive owiter of the dividends appropriated to his share under the deed he was without any interest in or lawful claim upon the dividends awarded to the shares of the other creditors. Neither Meredith nor Price as his administrator ever claimed any part of the dividends which constitute the fund in dispute. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>In 1867 Meredith\u2019s heirs endeavored to have them adjudged to be assets of his estate, but the decision of the orphans\u2019 court was adverse to their contention and they acquiesced in it. The renewal of their contention in another form and forum after the lapse of a quarter of a century, is to say the least of it, somewhat remarkable, and evincive of a change of view respecting their relation to the dividends they then sought to appropriate. These dividends were in the hands of their ancestor who they allege was the owner of the claims on which they base their present contention. His books showed that the parties to whom they were awarded could not be found. If his legal representatives are entitled to them now his estate was entitled to them in 1867. But we need not discuss this subject further. For the reasons alreacty stated we think the appellants have no standing to contest the claim of the appellee. We think, too, that as no one having the right to contest the claim appears, or can be found, the proper decree was entered on the authority of the decision in the Estate of Potter &amp; Page, 54 Pa. 465.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-5\">Decree affirmed and appeal dismissed at the cost of the appellants.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
