Did you put up additional producers so as to produce additional gas supply? A. Yes, sir; we put up one more. Q. That makes six? A. Yes, sir. Q. And connected them with what? A. With this flue that Mr. S my the built. Q. That is the tank flue? A. The tank flue. Q. Now, what men did you have in charge \u2014 experienced or otherwise ? A. I had Arthur Mattern, the most experienced man that I know of in the United States, in charge of that tank. Q. Did you have experienced men in charge of the producers? A. Yes, sir; the very best I knew of. Q. Did you encounter any difficulty in getting the gas from the producers to that tank? A. With the new flues? Q. Yes. A. No, sir. Q. Now, under those <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>conditions, has the tank, as built and designed by the plaintiff, ever shown the capacity to employ thirty-six men working three shifts a day, working under the rules and regulations of the American Glass Workers\u2019 Association?\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b192-4\">By Mr. Ferguson : \u201cWe object, first, for the reason that there is no guaranty that the tank will furnish the glass sufficient for thirty-six window glass blowers; that the question is whether or not the tank is of the kind that is desired to work that number of blowers \u2014 whether it is of the size and design generally used for that number of workmen.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b192-5\">By the Court: \u25a0\u201c To exclude evidence here would be for the court to undertake to pass upon the question of this design.

No, sir, it has not shown any such capacity as that. Q. What capacity has it shown under those conditions ? A. Twenty-seven to thirty blowers. [2] Q.

Tell us, Mr. Phillips, the amount of your fixed charges, taxes, insurance and salaries, but not profits or losses, between Sept. 19, 1891, and April 15, 1892, the date when you said you resumed operations with the new flue.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b193-3\">Objected to as incompetent and irrelevant, and not the proper measure of damages.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b193-4\">By Mr. McCook: \u201cWe are, of course, not claiming for profits or loss. We are claiming for those dead, continuing expenses that go on at all times for such works as this, and which I \u25a0have always understood is a proper measure of damages in such a case.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b193-5\">By the Court: \u201cIf they were fixed charges of this part of the plant, I understand they had a glass works, and that they were running probably the balance of the'glass works. We don\u2019t know how much was running, and probably these fixed charges belong to it. With proper limitations the item may possibly go in. The whole matter indicates to me very stronglj\u2019\u2019 that it will turn out to be largely incompetent, if we let it go in now.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b193-6\">By Mr. McCook: \u201c We will start with the quantity of fixed charges per month.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b193-7\">By the Court: \u201c We will overrule the objection and seal bill for plaintiff.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b193-8\">\u201cA.

L. Dixon, a witness on the stand, and other witnesses, \u201c that the premises of the Phillips Glass Company, upon which the tank furnace and other structures mentioned in the agreement sued on in this case were to be constructed, were in a narrow and contracted space, and that at the time of making the contract a question of affording room for the materials to be used by the plaintiff came up between the parties, and that the defendant company agreed that they would give storage for such materials as the plaintiffs required in order to enable them expeditiously to perform their work, and that upon the faith of this agreement of the defendant, the plaintiffs agreed as to the date at which the work was to be completed, and that without such agreement upon the part of the defendant they would not have engaged to complete the furnace at the date specified in the agreement in evidence.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"67\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b195-6\">This was objected to as irrelevant, incompetent and not rebuttal.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"68\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b195-7\">\u2022 The objection was sustained and bill sealed for plaintiff. [1]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"69\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b195-8\">\u201cWe propose to prove by the witness on the stand that the only available place for the construction of the flue leading from the producer to the tank on the premises of the defendant was under the buildings, and that the plaintiff located and originally intended to construct the flue under said building; that the defendant objected to such construction, and directed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>the plaintiff to construct the said flue in a public alley running alongside of his premises; that this direction was given after the execution of the contract between the parties; that in constructing the flue in said alley the plaintiffs were delayed in their work because they were exposed to the rains of the season, which were unusually heavy at the time; because the flue had to be erected in shorter sections than it would have been in the place where it was originally intended to construct it; because the progress of the work was interfered with by the use of a track owned by the defendants crossing said alley; because they were compelled to do their work much more slowly in order to not incommode parties abutting upon the alley, other than the defendant, from traveling thereon, and using the same.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"70\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b196-4\">This was objected' to as irrelevant under the terms of the contract, and also incompetent.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"71\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b196-5\">The objection was sustained and bill sealed for plaintiff. [3]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"72\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b196-6\">Plaintiff\u2019s point and answer which is assigned as error was as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"73\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b196-7\">\u201c First. That in the performance of the written contract sued on in this case, the plaintiff was only bound to bring to its performance such skill and knowledge as men ordinarily skilled in the erection and construction of such work possessed at the time said contract was entered into. And that subject to this degree of skill and knowledge, plaintiff had the right to determine the size and construction of the tank melting furnace, and of the Wellman producers, and the size, mode of construction and inode of connection of the flues or conduits to convey the gas from the producers to the melting tank, blowing furnace, flattening ovens and floater kilns, and all other matters relating to the plan or design of the plant to be constructed under said contract, except where specific provisions in relation thereto were set out in the contract. And said plaintiff, further, was only bound to use in the work, material of the best quality for the work required, and do the work in a thoroughly workmanlike manner. That plaintiff was not bound to furnish more than five Wellman producers under the contract, even if it should be found that more than five were required to furnish the necessary amount of gas. And if the jury find that the plaintiff did construct the plant according to its own plans and specifications, and that in the doing of said work and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>designing thereof it had exercised the care and skill which men engaged in that business ordinarily possessed and exercised, then plaintiff is not responsible for the result of the work done, unless the jury find that the flues and producers built or like parts of the work built and furnished by the plaintiff could have been so changed and rearranged as to produce a successful operation of the furnace. <em>Answer: </em>That point, as put, is refused. In the first place plaintiff was not only to erect and construct the plant, but was to prepare its plans and specifications ; that is, it was to be the architect as well as the building contractor, and its skill and care must extend to its conduct in both capacities. You will recollect that is a criticism upon the portion of the point which refers to its exercising proper care in the erection and construction of its work. That should refer also to the planning of it, or, rather, the preparing of the plans and specifications for it. In the second place, whilst the plaintiff was to build only five Wellman producers, and whilst if those producers are of a fixed size and capacity the point would, in this.respect, correctly express the law, defendant maintains that these producers are constructed of all sizes and capacities, and in such cases a contract to supply five producers as part of a plant sufficient to work thirty-six blowers, is a contract to build those furnaces of sufficient size and capacity to do their part of the work of such plant. As I have before said to you, if you find that those producers are of a fixed size and capacity, then the number of them was fixed by the contract, and the plaintiff was only bound to build that number. But if the capacity depended upon the size \u2014 that is, if they are built of different sizes and capacities \u2014 then the company in contracting to build a certain number for a certain work contracted to build them of sufficient capacity to perform their work. With the qualifications that I have suggested, the point correctly expresses the law. As I have already said, the plaintiff company was not bound to produce perfection in this work, was not bound to bring the highest degree of skill and knowledge to the performance of it, but was bound, ordinarily, to bring to its performance only such skill and knowledge as men ordinarily skilled in such work have and exercise.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"74\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b198-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>Defendant\u2019s point and answer, which was assigned as error, was as follows :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"75\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b198-4\">\u201c Third.

First party to erect three of said producers, and connect same with gas valve of said furnace by flues or conduits of suitable size to convey the gas from producers to valve in sufficient quantity to operate said furnace. First party further agrees to erect twm additional producers, and connect same by flues or conduits of suitable size with two blowing furnaces, and three flattening ovens erected or to be erected by second party, also with floater kiln hereinafter named to be erected by first party.\u201d The contract was to be completed not later than 15th of September in the next year; with the proviso, however, that should the work be delayed by failure of defendant to comply with the agreement, or by remodeling its buildings, or by any cause beyond plaintiff\u2019s control, the time was to be extended. In addition to the work stipulated for in the written contract, by a verbal agreement between them the plaintiff agreed to erect, on the same premises, a \u201cflattening oven \u201d for $2,125. The written agreement embodied general specifications of the character of the work to be done, and the results to be accomplished.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-3\">The plaintiff, claiming it had fully performed its contract, on or about the 1st of December, 1891, filed a mechanic\u2019s lien against the premises, on the 18th of March, 1892, claiming a balance due and unpaid on the contract of $11,941.65, with interest from date of completion of work, and issued sci. fa. thereon for judgment; to this, defendant filed affidavit of defense, denying any indebtedness on the contract, and averring that, on the contrary, plaintiff was indebted to it in the sum of $10,366.74, because of damages sustained by reason of plaintiff\u2019s nonfulfillment of its contract, both as to design and quality of work done, and failure to finish it within the stipulated time. At the trial, the court below treated the questions in dispute as ones of fact mainly, and submitted the evidence bearing on them to the jury. The verdict was for plaintiff in the sum of $3,055.88, instead of the $11,941.65 claimed, and it now appeals, assigning twelve errors to rulings on admission or rejection of evidence, and charge of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>The dispute between the parties arises, principally, because of opposite construction of this paragraph in the contract:</p>\n<p id=\"b200-4\">\u201c First party (plaintiff) guarantees that the work will be done in a thoroughly workmanlike manner, and that all material used will be of the best quality for the purpose required, and further, that the gas flues or conduits, will have capacity sufficient to supply the various furnaces and ovens named, and while not guaranteeing absolutely the successful operation of the furnaces, first party to use every endeavor in their power to make them operate successfully.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b200-5\">It will be noticed, the contract was to erect a tank melting furnace designed to work thirty-six blowers in three equal shifts per day; the furnace to be operated with fuel gas manufactured from coal, by what is known as the \u201c Wellman\u201d producer. As necessary to a proper understanding of the contract, a fact clearly established by the decided weight of the evidence should be stated: viz, that this method of melting\u2019 glass in a tank for blowing, instead of in pots, and operating the furnace with fuel gas, instead of with natural gas, or coal, had hardly passed beyond the stage of experiment; therefore, as both parties had full knowledge and experience in glass manufacture, it may be assumed that the plaintiff did not intend to guarantee, absolutely, a successful result, nor did defendant intend to exact such guaranty. The surroundings of parties at the time of making a contract, and the subject-matter thereof, are always admissible to ascertain their intention, if their expressions be ambiguous or disputable. Having in view this situation of the parties, as an aid to the interpretation of the guaranty clause of the contract, already quoted, we are of opinion, the plaintiff was bound to show: \u2014 1. That the work was done in a thoroughly workmanlike manner, and that the material used was of the best quality for the purpose. 2. That the gas flues had a capacity sufficient to supply the furnaces and ovens. 3. That they had used every endeavor in their power to make them operate successfully.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-6\">But this was, as to this particular, the full extent of their undertaking; they, by the use of the words, \u201c while not guaranteeing absolutely the successful operation of the furnaces,\u201d clearly relieve themselves of any undertaking as to a successful result, even after the three stipulations noticed be fully per<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>formed; all the hazard of what was an experiment was to be assumed by the party for whom the work was done, and not by the party who contracted to do it. On this interpretation of the contract, plaintiff offered evidence tending to establish that the work was well done, the material of the best quality, the producers and gas flues were of sufficient capacity, and that they did their best to make the furnaces operate successfully. And if this had been all that appeared in the case, they would have been entitled to a verdict for the balance unpaid on the contract, for they did not undertake that either tank melting or fuel gas should prove a success in glass manufacturing.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-3\">But it will be noticed, that plaintiff undertook to furnish three \u201cWellman\u201d producers for the manufacture of natural gas, and to connect them by flues of suitable size to convey the gas from the producer's in sufficient quantity to operate the furnaces. Defendant averred, the producers were not of a size to furnish gas in sufficient quantitjq even if the flues were sufficient; and it adduced evidence tending to show that Wellman producers were of different sizes; that the term itself imported no particular size, and they could be, and often were, made larger than those supplied by plaintiff. In reply to this, plaintiff offered evidence, tending to show that the term \u201cWellman producer \u201d meant just such a one as they had constructed, and certainly did not mean a larger one; probably, as it appears to us, the weight of the evidence was with plaintiff as to this fact; nevertheless, it was a disputed fact for the jury. Plaintiff did not undertake that fuel gas should successfully operate the furnace, but it did undertake, if there were producers and flues of sufficient and insufficient size, then it would use \u201c every endeavor to make the furnaces operate successfully; \u201d and further, that it would make \u201c any re-arrangement or changes to the flues and producers, or anything of that kind, found necessary for the successful operation of the furnaces.\u201d If plaintiff did not put in producers of sufficient size according.to plans prepared, which were to be prepared by itself, when it could have done so, it is answerable in damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-4\">The plaintiff, in undertaking that the work should be done according to plans and specifications prepared by itself, was more than a builder; it was also the architect, and, to a certain extent, the designer of its own work; this fact made it some<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>what difficult to define the exact measure of its responsibility; but we think the learned judge of the court below, under this contract, correctly stated the law applicable to the evidence when he said to the jury: \u201cIf it is true that a Wellman producer means a producer of a certain size, then defendants could not complain, if three producers were erected, even if they did not produce sufficient gas; or if the producers erected are the largest size of Wellman producers, then they have all they contracted for. But if the Wellman producer is, as the defendant claims, a producer which can be erected of any size, then an agreement to erect producers, as part of a plant to work thirty-six blowers, is an agreement to build those producers of sufficient size and capacity to do their part of the work of said plant, and plaintiff should have so built them.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b202-4\">This interpretation of the contract, was also- applicable to the damages claimed, because of improper application of heat to the tank, and a defective construction of the flue; plaintiff was answerable for defective and unworkmanlike construction, but was not answerable for incapacity of a new method or process, or for the unauthorized acts of third persons; the conflicting evidence on these questions was fairly submitted to the jury. This disposes of the tenth and eleventh, appellant\u2019s most important assignments of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-5\">As to the first assignment, appellant offered evidence to prove that defendant, at the time of making the contract, promised plaintiff to provide for it, on the premises, room for storage of certain materials to facilitate performance of the work, and without such promise plaintiff would not have contracted to complete the work by the dajr mentioned in the agreement. This was objected to by defendant, and excluded by the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-6\">The agreement expressly provided, that defendant would make ready the buildings, and give plaintiff possession on June 1,1891, \u201c for the purpose of performing the work covered by this contract.\u201d As plaintiff had offered in evidence the written agreement, and relied on it as a ground of recovery, we do not think it was competent to set up a contemporaneous parol agreement in rebuttal of defendant\u2019s claim for damages. It was not a failure on part of defendant to perform any part of the written contract, or any act of defendant subsequent to it, not intended by it, but the offer was to prove a failure to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>perform another and a parol agreement, made at the same time as the written one; no fraud or mistake was alleged which would authorize a modification of the writing. The introduction in rebuttal of such new matter was not warranted by any rule of evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-3\">Second assignment. Defendant offered evidence to show,, the tank as built and designed by plaintiff had not sufficient capacity for thirty-six men working three shifts per day. It was objected to, for the reason that plaintiff did not guarantee it would have such capacity. In the construction put upon the contract, in discussing the tenth and eleventh assignments of error, this was admissible. It was not competent for defendant to prove that melting glass in a tank was not a success, but it was competent to prove that this tank was not large enough for three shifts every twenty-four hours, even if the new method would otherwise have been successful.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-4\">As to the third assignment, on reading the evidence it plainly appears the offer by plaintiff was admitted ; noting \u201c objection sustained,\u201d was an error of the reporter, which is shown by the fact that the witness did testify to all the facts proposed to be proved; besides, the course of cross-examination by defendant\u2019s counsel indicates that he had testified in support of the offer. The court below ought to have had this error corrected before certifying the record ; if the records of a court import verity, then it is incumbent on him who certifies to them to see to it, under the full authority given by the constitution to all courts, that manifest errors are corrected.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-5\">The twelfth assignment complains of the admission of testi-' mony as to the cost of rearranging and changing flues, which defendant alleged were badlj\u2019- located and defectively constructed.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-6\">As we have already noticed, by the contract, plaintiff stipulated that: \u201c It would make any re-arrangement or changes to the flues and producers, or anything of that kind found necessary for the successful operation of the furnaces, without further cost\u201d to defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-7\">Notice to plaintiff, and opportunity to make the change, are implied, before it could be charged with the cost of such change. There was ample evidence of precedent notice to plaintiff to remedy the alleged defects in the construction of this, and other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>parts of the work; it did not believe the contract imposed upon it such obligation, and refused to do so. Whether the change was such as warranted defendant in charging the plaintiff with the cost of it, depended on the finding of the jury as to the fact of defective construction. It was material, theiefore, to defendant to prove when the contract to remedy the defect had been made, if for no other reason than to show the expenditure was subsequent to the notice. There was no error in the admission of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-4\">All the other assignments relate to the instruction of the court as to the measure of damages, and the admission of evidence relating thereto. The peculiarity of the contract made it difficult to distinguish whether success in operation failed because of defective performance by plaintiff of its contract, as designer and builder, or because of the adoption of new methods; the same peculiarity, also, made the rules determining the measure of damages somewhat difficult of application to the conflicting evidence. The learned court instructed the jury, if they found plaintiff had not performed its contract, then defendant was entitled to damages in: 1. The amount reasonably and necessarily expended in completing the contract. 2. The expense incurred and material lost, in attempting to operate the plant, so long as it was reasonable to operate it, in order to ascertain whether it would operate successfully. 3. The expense incurred, necessary to preserve the tank and material in it, while making necessary changes in flues and- producers. 4. Fair compensation, on the testimony, for the use of the plant while deprived of its use by failure of plaintiff to fulfil its contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-5\">This was followed, again, by the caution, that if plaintiff had used due skill in its work, but experience demonstrated that the method was at fault, then defendant must bear the <em>loss; </em>that distinction must be made between care and skill and experiment. As is said in McKnight v. Ratcliff, 44 Pa. 156 : \u201c It is often much easier to discover when an assumed rule for damages will lead to erroneous results, than to point out in all cases, in advance, what the true rule should be.\u201d Logically, the rule laid down by the learned judge would possibly lead to an estimate of what profits might have been made while defendant was deprived of the use of its plant. But it did not lead to that result, for he properly controlled the admission and effect <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>of the evidence so as to exclude any estimate based on what speculative profits defendant might have made, and confined the estimate to the actual loss. The court very plainly said to the jury, they were to ascertain \u201cHow much it was worth as a plant to a man desiring to use it; how much rent would he pay for it ? .... As I have explained to you, these other items that were admitted in evidence, will not be taken into account as a measure of damages. They are only for the purpose of aiding you to get at the value of the plant; that is, the rental value during the time of the delay.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b205-3\">While fair compensation for the use of the plant when idle would, theoretically, be reimbursement for loss of profits, yet the impossibility of determining the amount of profits in this case, as in nearly every case of like character, was recognized by the court; such estimate would have been purely speculative as to what, under the most favorable circumstances, might have been made; therefore, the consideration of the jury was limited strictly to what would have been a fair rental value: Sedgwick on Damages, sec. 170. And on this question, all the evidence complained of had a bearing, and there was no error in not excluding it.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-4\">A careful examination of the more than 400 pages of testimony, with the many rulings on objections thereto, as well as a consideration of the very full and clear charge of the court, leads us to the conclusion no error warranting a reversal of the judgment was committed.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-5\">The judgment is therefore affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
