The testator disposed of his whole estate as follows: \u2018 Item I give and bequeath to my son George and son Silas Weiler all my real estate for the sum of $2,500, and after her decease, that is to say, my wife, Mary Weiler, then after all funeral expense is paid, then all my personal property to be sold and all debts paid, then all what is left to be divided equally amongst my ten children or to their heirs or assigns.\u2019</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b87-10\">\u201c The auditor to whom the matter was referred by the court to take testimony and find the facts, has found as a fact that George and Silas Weiler accepted the real estate devised to them under this clause of the will, but that the valuation moneys mentioned therein were not paid by them or by any one else for them. The land has since passed into possession of other parties, and the several interests of the devisees are now held by Isaac Styer, who is in possession of the same.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b87-11\">\u201c The auditor further finds, among other facts, that Mary Weiler, the widow, died on Oct. 18, 1875; that Silas Weiler was adjudged a bankrupt in 1868; on December 17th of that year David G. Esbleman, the assignee in bankruptcy of Silas Weiler, conveyed all the right and title of said Silas Weiler at the time he was adjudged a bankrupt, of the thirty-acre tract of land in question, which interest was subsequently purchased by Isaac Styer, the present owner; that after the death of the widow, George Weiler on Nov. 6,1875, conveyed his undivided interest in said land to Rebecca Weiler, widow of Silas Weiler; that the sheriff of Lancaster county on \u00e1 writ of venditioni ex-ponas issued out of the court of common pleas, on Oct. 6,1880, sold the interest of George Weiler in said land to John B. Good, who, in turn, sold and conveyed the same to Isaac Styer, the present owner.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b87-12\">\u201c It is contended on the part of the rule that the land devised <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>to the sons by the testator was subject to the charge of the valuation moneys or legacies, and that it is still subject to the payment of them. There is no doubt, in our opinion, that the acceptance of the real estate was, in law, a purchase by the devisees, to take effect after the decease of the widow, upon condition of the <em>payment </em>of these moneys, <em>that </em>this was the evident intent of the testator in making the devise to his sons can be readily seen from the disposition he makes of the moneys, which formed part of the estate for the purposes of distribution, as it is to be equally divided among his ten children, which includes the devisees. The interest that these devisees, therefore, had in the property was merely an equitable one, the legal title to the land being conditioned upon the payment of the valuation moneys.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b88-5\">\u201cIt was said in Gilbert\u2019s App., 85 Pa. 347, that \u2018While, in order to make legacies a charge on land it must be found such was the testator\u2019s intention, still it is not necessary that its ascertainment should rest on direct expression. It is enough if the intention appears by natural and obvious implication from the provisions of the will.\u2019 \u2018 In that case the testator gave certain land to one of his sons at $33.00 per acre, the proceeds thereof to be divided into eight equal shares, and distributed equally among his sons and daughters. Held, that it was the intent of the testator that the land should be charged with the payment of these legacies.\u2019 See also Hart v. Homiller\u2019s Exr., 23 Pa. 39; Wertz\u2019 App., 69 Pa. 173; Kneeht\u2019s App., 71 Pa. 333 ; Pierce, Adm\u2019x, v. Livingston, Adm\u2019r, 80 Pa. 99; Hoover v. Hoover, 5 Pa. 351.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b88-6\">\u201c If the construction we have given to the will is the correct one, and the land was accepted subject to the charge, we do not see that either the sale by the assignee in bankruptcy of Silas\u2019 interest, or the sale by the sheriff of George\u2019s interest can effect the charge on the land. Either of these sales must necessarily be subject to the payment of the valuation moneys. Indeed, the conveyance by the assignee in bankruptcy was expressly so made.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b88-7\">\u201cWe are of opinion that, as the valuation moneys in the devise under this will to George and Silas Weiler have not been paid, the rule in this case should be made absolute.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b88-8\">\u201c We direct a decree to be drawn up by counsel for the rule, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>ordering and directing the said Isaac Styer, the present owner of the land, to pay the said moneys with interest from the date of the death of the widow, to wit: un Oct. 18, 1875, on the first day of April next, or, in default thereof, a writ of levari facias is to be issued to sell the same.

It is unnecessary to add anything to what he has said on the subject. For reasons given in his opinion, the decree, with slight modification, should be affirmed. Under the clause of the. will, quoted in said opinion, testator\u2019s sons George and Silas, devisees of the land, are each entitled to one tenth of the twenty-five hundred dollars charged thereon, and hence the decree should be for only four fifths of that sum, viz: two thousand dollars, with interest from the death of testator\u2019s widow. And, inasmuch as the period, within which the money was required to be paid, had elapsed, there should be an extension of the time until July 1, 1895. With these modifications, as to amount and time of payment, the decree should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-7\">Decree, as above modified, affirmed; and appeal dismissed, with costs to be paid by the appellant.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
