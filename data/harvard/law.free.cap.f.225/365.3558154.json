In its charge to the jury the trial court used the following language:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b380-5\">\u201cI think, however, you' will have little trouble in concluding from the evidence in this case that these officers did discover out there a spring wagon, loaded with a large quantity of whisky. I think you will have little trouble in arriving at the conclusion that the liquor was marked Hill &amp; Hill, and that it was also marked with the name of some man Gilley of Ft. Smith. I think you will have little trouble in arriving at the conclusion that the people in possession of that liquor, or somebody, had introduced it from a point outside the state, and probably from Ft. Smith, into this the Eastern District of Oklahoma, into Muskogee county, which was formerly part of the Indian Territory, and that therefore somebody was in the act of violating the law. If you arrive at those conclusions, after a consideration -of the evidence, then there remains but the one question: Was this defendant in possession of that liquor? Was he one of the men that was out there, and, if he was, does the evidence, that being true, establish his connection with it in such way as that he aided, abetted, assisted, or procured in its introduction?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b380-6\">This portion of the charge was excepted to by counsel for defendant, and the giving of said instruction is assigned as error. We have carefully examined the evidence in the record, and we do not think the court was justified in telling the jury that they would have little trouble in finding that the liquor had been introduced from a point outside the state and probably from Ft. Smith into the Eastern District of Oklahoma. The evidence was not clear upon this point. We also think the remaining portion of the language excepted to was in effect a charge that if the jury found the defendant was in possession of the liquor then a conviction should follow. Under the decisions of this court, mere possession of the intoxicating liquor would not be sufficient to authorize a conviction of the crime charged. Chambliss v. United States, 132 C. C.
