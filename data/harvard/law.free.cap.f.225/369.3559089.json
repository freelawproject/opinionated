At the close of all the evidence offered at the trial, counsel for Parks moved the court to instruct the jury to return a verdict of not guilty, for the reason that the testimony was not sufficient to warrant the conviction of the defendant. This motion was overruled, and an exception taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>We are of the opinion that the motion should have been granted. In accordance with the previous decisions of this court, there was not sufficient evidence that the defendant introduced the liquor as charged. Chambliss v. United States, 218 Fed. 154, 132 C. C.
