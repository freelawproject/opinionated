The demurrers were overruled and an exception taken. \u2022</p>\n<p id=\"b381-16\">We have carefully read the testimony, and are of the opinion that the demurrers should have been sustained. There was a failure of evidence to show that the defendants introduced the liquor as charged. Chambliss v. United States, 218 Eed. 154, 132 C. C. A. 112; Lewellen v.
