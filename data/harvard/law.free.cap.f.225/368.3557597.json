At tlie close of all the evidence offered at the trial, counsel for the defendant demurred to the evidence introduced, for the reason that it failed to show the defendant guilty as charged. The demurrer was overruled, and an exception taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-4\">We are of the opinion that the demurrer ought to have been sustained, as there was not sufficient evidence that the defendant introduced intoxicating liquor into Muskogee county from without the district or state of Oklahoma.
