National Signalling Co. (D. C.) 213 Fed. 815. Judge Hough\u2019s opinion in the case at bar is reported in 225 Fed. 65. We do not think it necessary to add anything to the discussion at this stage of the case; with the facts before him j udge Hough quite properly granted the preliminary injunction.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-12\">(Irders affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
