Code, \u00a7 646.9, subd. (b) [count 1]; unless otherwise stated, all statutory references that follow are to the Penal Code), and three counts of disobeying a court order (\u00a7 166, subds. (a) (4), (c)(1) [counts 2-4]). The trial court found true an allegation as to count 1 that defendant had a prior conviction for assault with a deadly weapon (\u00a7 245, subd. (a)(1)) within the meaning of sections 667, subdivisions (b) through (i), and 1170.12, subdivisions (a) through (d). The court sentenced defendant to the midterm of three years in state prison for count 1, doubled to six years because of defendant\u2019s prior strike. For counts 2 through 4, the court sentenced defendant concurrently to six months each in state prison. The court awarded defendant 175 days of actual credit and 87 days of conduct credit, for a total of 262 days\u2019 credit.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-8\">Defendant contends on appeal that the trial court erred in instructing the jury, that the six-month sentences on the misdemeanor charges should have been stayed pursuant to section 654, and that he is entitled to two-for-two conduct credits under the current section 4019 rather than four-for-two conduct credits under former section 4019, which was in effect when defendant was arrested. We agree the misdemeanor sentences on counts 2 through 4 should have been stayed under section 654. In all other respects, we affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-9\">Facts and Proceedings</p>\n<p id=\"b101-10\">Defendant and the victim, Kathryn C., met in 2003. Although never married, they were in a relationship for approximately five and a half years. They had three children together, one of whom passed away shortly after birth. The couple broke up in 2009 while Kathryn C. was pregnant with their third child.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-11\">Defendant has a long and violent criminal history, and in particular a history of committing domestic violence against Kathryn C. Defendant verbally and emotionally abused Kathryn C. on countless occasions and physically abused her three times. In April 2004, defendant and Kathryn C. were watching a fight on television and were rooting for opposing fighters. Kathryn C. playfully teased defendant when her contestant won. Defendant began screaming at Kathryn C. and threw a phone across the room, hitting her in the leg. Defendant was convicted of a misdemeanor domestic violence charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>In September 2004, Kathryn C. was sitting on a bicycle she and defendant had purchased. After getting into an argument, defendant grabbed Kathryn C.\u2019s wrist and yanked her off the bike. Kathryn C. sustained bruises and scratches to her wrist and ankle. Kathryn C. then went into the house she shared with her mother. Defendant followed, charging towards the screen door and throwing his body against the door to try to force his way into the house.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-5\">Defendant began yelling at Kathryn C. for his medication, which was located in her room upstairs. After retrieving defendant\u2019s pills, Kathryn C. handed the medicine to her mother. Kathryn C.\u2019s mother placed the pills in a dining room window. Defendant tried to grab Kathryn C.\u2019s mother and pull her through the window. Sometime during the melee, defendant made his way into the house and Kathryn C.\u2019s mother attempted to call 911. After she hung up, the emergency operator called back and Kathryn C. answered the phone. While Kathryn C. was on the phone, defendant pulled the phone plug out of the wall stating he did not want Kathryn C. speaking to the police and that he was not going back to jail. Defendant grabbed a knife and ran upstairs threatening to kill himself. Among other things, defendant was convicted in Placer County of misdemeanor domestic battery.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-6\">In June 2005 when defendant and Kathryn C. were living in the State of Washington, defendant became enraged when he could not locate a shaving razor. After screaming at Kathryn C. that she had lost the razor, defendant charged her and threw her on the bed. Defendant shoved his forearm across Kathryn C.\u2019s throat and began choking her for approximately a minute; Kathryn C. could barely breathe. While choking her defendant stated, \u201cI don\u2019t want you to breathe.\u201d Defendant\u2019s mother ran into the bedroom, jumped on defendant\u2019s back, and pulled his hair to get him to stop choking Kathryn C. Defendant was convicted of a felony domestic-violence-related assault.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-7\">No-contact orders were issued in Washington and California protecting Kathryn C. from defendant. Following the choking incident, a Washington court issued a no-contact order in September 2005. In February 2010, the Placer County Superior Court issued a criminal protective order prohibiting defendant from having any contact with Kathryn C. That order was modified in March 2010 to further prohibit defendant from coming within 100 yards of Kathryn C. In August 2010, the Placer County court again modified the protective order requiring defendant to stay at least 60 yards away from Kathryn C., but permitting peaceful contact for the sole purpose of safely exchanging their children during court-ordered supervised visits between defendant and the children at a designated facility known as \u201cParenting Time.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b103-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>Defendant\u2019s violent past terrified Kathryn C., and she was very afraid for herself and her children because defendant continually violated the no-contact orders. She called the police six to 10 times to report defendant\u2019s violations. Although he had been arrested and jailed on at least one violation, upon his release defendant immediately contacted Kathryn C. Kathryn C. did not seek any new restraining orders because she believed defendant did not abide by the existing protective orders and she felt the orders did little to keep him away from her.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-5\">Between 2005 and 2010, Kathryn C. invited defendant over to her house approximately 15 times despite the no-contact orders so that he could see his son and help her while she was pregnant with their third child. After the birth in April 2010, Kathryn C. stopped inviting defendant over.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-6\">Yet defendant continued contacting Kathryn C. On June 19, 2010, defendant showed up unannounced at Kathryn C.\u2019s home accusing her of stealing money from his father. When police later spoke t\u00f3 defendant on the phone about the incident, reminding him of the no-contact restraining order, defendant said he did not care whether the protective order was no-contact or peaceful contact because he intended to continue contacting Kathryn C. and his children regardless of the nature of the order.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-7\">On August 10, 2010, defendant had a friend living near Kathryn C. call her to convince Kathryn C. to bring the children over to the friend\u2019s house to see defendant. Kathryn C. called police to report a violation of the no-contact order. Defendant was convicted of a misdemeanor for violating the restraining order.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-8\">During this time period Kathryn C. started dating another man, David F. They began dating at the end of June 2010 and by August 2010 David F. was living full time with Kathryn C. at her house. The three had been mutual friends when Kathryn C. and defendant were together. After Kathryn C. and David F. began dating, defendant was verbally combative and repeatedly tried to pick fights with David F. in front of Kathryn C. or otherwise make him uncomfortable. She believed defendant was jealous of David F. because he perceived him as taking over defendant\u2019s family. Around this time, defendant told Kathryn C., \u201cIf you don\u2019t be careful, something is going to happen to you.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b103-9\">Toward the end of April or beginning of May 2011, defendant moved into a friend\u2019s apartment located next door to Kathryn C.\u2019s apartment. After <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>moving in, defendant\u2019s contacts with Kathryn C. became more frequent and aggressive. Defendant could see Kathryn C. walking from her residence to the sidewalk through a window in his apartment. He began contacting her two to three times a day\u2014nearly every time Kathryn C. left her apartment. In approximately one month, defendant contacted Kathryn C. between 40 and 50 times.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-4\">During this time defendant repeatedly asked Kathryn C. to let him see or take the children. When Kathryn C. told him no and asked him to leave her alone, defendant swore at her and angrily stated, \u201cSomebody needs to beat you up . . . .\u201d On multiple occasions after Kathryn C. pleaded with defendant to stop bothering her, defendant told Kathryn C. that \u201cSomebody is going to kick your butt just like I did this to [certain individuals defendant had hurt in other fights].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b104-5\">On May 20, 2011, defendant approached Kathryn C. and David E near the garage of Kathryn C.\u2019s apartment requesting to see the children. David E told defendant they did not want to speak to him right then and asked him to go away. Defendant replied either, \u201cOh, talk to me that way, someone is going to end up breaking your jaw for talking to somebody that way,\u201d or \u201cYou better get the fuck out of here or you\u2019re going to get knocked out.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> After Kathryn C. told David E she did not feel safe with defendant living next door because he constantly intimidated her, David E flagged down a passing police officer, Officer Fox, and reported the incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-6\">Officer Fox located and arrested defendant a short distance away. After being placed under arrest, defendant became irate, cursing at Officer Fox and calling him a \u201cpiece of shit.\u201d Defendant repeated that the officer was a \u201cpiece of shit\u201d and that he was \u201cjust as fucked up as the justice system.\u201d While in the patrol car, defendant told the officer that the restraining order against him \u201cdidn\u2019t mean shit, and he was going to be out [of jail] in 20 minutes . . . and he was going to go back to [Kathryn C.\u2019s] house immediately.\u201d When the officer responded that he could not contact Kathryn C. due to the restraining order defendant replied, \u201cYou can\u2019t keep me away. I have proof. There\u2019s two warrants for the same thing and the dollar amounts are so low for the warrants that I\u2019ll just . . . [get released on my own recognizance] from the jail.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b104-7\">Based on defendant\u2019s statements about immediately returning to Kathryn C.\u2019s house upon his release, Officer Fox contacted the on-call judge to raise defendant\u2019s bail. When defendant learned of the higher bail, defendant said <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>he did not care and would not show up when his case was called. Defendant also said, \u201cWhen I get out of here, if I shoot her, there\u2019s nothing you can do about it.\u201d Defendant repeated the statement when asked by the officer what he had said.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-5\">Officer Fox called Kathryn C. and told her what defendant said about shooting her. He asked whether Kathryn C. knew if defendant had a gun. She said she did not know, but that she was very scared. She also informed the officer defendant had told her there was nothing the police could do to keep him away from her.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-6\">Defendant was charged with stalking Kathryn C. from June 1, 2010, to May 20, 2011. He was also charged with violating the no-contact orders on June 19 and August 10, 2010, and May 20, 2011. A jury convicted defendant of all charges. Defendant timely appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-7\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b105-8\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b105-9\">\n<em>CALCRIM No. 1301</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b105-10\">Defendant contends the trial court erred in instructing the jury on the stalking charge. Defendant\u2019s challenge to the given instruction is threefold.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-11\">First, defendant alleges the trial court erred by failing to instruct the jury defendant had to know David F. was a member of Kathryn C.\u2019s immediate family when he threatened David F. in Kathryn C.\u2019s presence.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-12\">Second, defendant argues the court failed to instruct the jury that threats made about the victim to a third party could only constitute a credible threat under the statute if defendant intended that those threats be conveyed to the victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-13\">Third, defendant claims the instruction, as given, failed to require the jury to determine whether some of defendant\u2019s statements were constitutionally protected free speech under the First Amendment. As a corollary, defendant argues his statements to Officer Fox about shooting Kathryn C. qualified as free speech and therefore could not form the basis of a stalking violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-14\">A. <em>Forfeiture</em></p>\n<p id=\"b105-15\">Before considering defendant\u2019s alleged errors, we first address the People\u2019s argument defendant forfeited his instructional challenge by failing to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>object to the stalking instruction below. \u201cGenerally, a party forfeits any challenge to a jury instruction that was correct in law and responsive to the evidence if the party fails to object in the trial court.\u201d <em>(People v. Franco </em>(2009) 180 Cal.App.4th 713, 719 [103 Cal.Rptr.3d 310] <em>(Franco).) </em>Defendant\u2019s claim, however, is that the instruction is <em>not </em>correct in law, and that it violated his federal constitutional rights because it omitted required elements from the statute. This type of claim need not be preserved by objection before an appellate court can address the issue. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Smithey </em>(1999) 20 Cal.4th 936, 976, fn. 7 [86 Cal.Rptr.2d 243, 978 P.2d 1171].) We therefore consider defendant\u2019s instructional error challenge.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-4\">B. <em>Standard of Review</em></p>\n<p id=\"b106-5\">We determine independently whether a jury instruction correctly states the law. <em>(People v. Ramos </em>(2008) 163 Cal.App.4th 1082, 1088 [78 Cal.Rptr.3d 186] [court \u201cdetermine^] whether a jury instruction correctly states the law under the independent or de novo standard of review\u201d].) Our task is to determine whether the trial court \u201c \u2018fully and fairly instructed on the applicable law.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>We consider the instructions as a whole as well as the entire record of trial, including the arguments of counsel. <em>(Franco, supra, </em>180 Cal.App ,4th at p. 720.) If reasonably possible, instructions are interpreted to support the judgment rather than defeat it. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b106-6\">C. <em>Knowledge Threatened Person Is Victim\u2019s Immediate Family Member</em></p>\n<p id=\"b106-7\">Based on CALCRIM No. 1301, the trial court instructed the jury on the stalking charge as follows: \u201cThe defendant is charged in Count One with stalking in violation of Penal Code Section 646.9. To prove that the defendant is guilty of this crime, the People must prove that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b106-8\">\u201c1. The defendant willfully and maliciously harassed or willfully, maliciously, and repeatedly followed another person,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b106-9\">\u201c2. The defendant made a credible threat with the intent to place the other person in reasonable fear for her safety or for the safety of her immediate family, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b106-10\">\u201c3. A criminal protective order in Placer County Superior Court Case No. 62-96081 and/or a domestic violence no-contact order from Chelan County Superior Court of Washington, Case No. 5103244 prohibiting the defendant from engaging in this conduct against the threatened person was in effect at the time of the conduct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b106-11\">\u201cA credible threat is one that causes the target of the threat to reasonably fear for his or her safety or for the safety of his or her immediate family, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>one that the maker of the threat appears to be able to carry out. A credible threat may be made orally, in writing, or electronically or may be impliedly <em>[sic] </em>or may be implied by a pattern of conduct or a combination of statements and conduct, [f] . . . [f]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ap\">\u201cImmediate family means: (A) Any spouse, parent, children; [f] (B) Any grandchildren, grandparents, brother, sisters, related by blood or by marriage or [f] (C) Any person who regularly lives in the other person\u2019s household. . . .\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b107-6\">The court\u2019s instruction was based on section 646.9, which reads in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b107-7\">\u201c(a) Any person who willfully, maliciously, and repeatedly follows or willfully and maliciously harasses another person and who makes a credible threat with the intent to place that person in reasonable fear for his or her safety, or the safety of his or her immediate family is guilty of the crime of stalking . ... HI] ... HD</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b107-8\">\u201c(e) For the purposes of this section, \u2018harasses\u2019 means engages in a knowing and willful course of conduct directed at a specific person that seriously alarms, annoys, torments, or terrorizes the person, and that serves no legitimate purpose.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b107-9\">\u201c(f) For the purposes of this section, \u2018course of conduct\u2019 means two or more acts occurring over a period of time, however short, evidencing a continuity of purpose. Constitutionally protected activity is not included within the meaning of \u2018course of conduct.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b107-10\">\u201c(g) For the purposes of this section, \u2018credible threat\u2019 means a verbal or written threat, including that performed through the use of an electronic communication device, or a threat implied by a pattern of conduct or a combination of verbal, written, or electronically communicated statements and conduct, made with the intent to place the person that is the target of the threat in reasonable fear for his or her safety or the safety of his or her family, and made with the apparent ability to carry out the threat so as to cause the person who is the target of the threat to reasonably fear for his or her safety or the safety of his or her family. It is not necessary to prove that the defendant had the intent to actually carry out the threat. The present incarceration of a person making the threat shall not be a bar to prosecution under this section. Constitutionally protected activity is not included within the meaning of \u2018credible threat.\u2019 [f] . . . [f]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b107-11\">\u201c(Z) For purposes of this section, \u2018immediate family\u2019 means any spouse, parent, child, any person related by consanguinity or affinity within the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>second degree, or any other person who regularly resides in the household, or who, within the prior six months, regularly resided in the household.\u201d (\u00a7 646.9.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b108-4\">Defendant\u2019s position is that the challenged instruction was not correct in law because the statute must be interpreted to require knowledge that a person is the victim\u2019s immediate family member within the meaning of section 646.9, subdivision (/), before any statements or conduct towards that person can qualify as a credible threat to the victim. According to defendant, statements made to a person other than the victim constitute a credible threat within the meaning of section 646.9, subdivision (g), only if the defendant knows that the person is an immediate family member of the victim. Absent such knowledge, defendant argues, an accused could not harbor the specific intent to place the <em>victim </em>in reasonable fear for the safety of that family member. Defendant contends this violates section 20, which requires that \u201c[i]n every crime or public offense there must exist a union, or joint operation of act and intent, or criminal negligence.\u201d (\u00a7 20.)</p>\n<p id=\"b108-5\">Given the prosecution\u2019s theory of the credible threat, however, we need not decide whether knowledge of one\u2019s status as an immediate family member of the victim is an implicit element of the stalking statute even though it may lack any explicit statutory requirement. This is because the prosecutor argued that defendant\u2019s entire course of conduct\u2014not just his statement to David F. in Kathryn C.\u2019s presence\u2014constituted the credible threat. The statement to David F. was but a minute aspect of this pattern of threatening conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-6\">Prior to trial, the judge specifically asked the prosecutor to explain his theory of the threat supporting the stalking charge. After listening to the prosecutor the judge replied, \u201cSo your theory is that his course of conduct was intended by him to be a threat to her?\u201d The prosecutor responded, \u201cYes, your Honor.\u201d As the prosecutor preliminarily explained to the judge, this course of conduct included defendant\u2019s long history of domestic violence against Kathryn C., his repeated violations of the no-contact orders, his statements directly to her that he would'not abide by the restraining orders, his threats to David F. in Kathryn C.\u2019s presence outside her home, and his conduct of watching her and contacting her almost on a daily basis every time she left her apartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-7\">During closing argument, the prosecutor reiterated his theory that defendant\u2019s entire course of conduct, and not merely his threat to David R, satisfied the credible threat element under the statute. The prosecutor first asked, \u201cDid his conduct create a credible threat? Did his conduct cause her to fear for her safety?\u201d Later the prosecutor told the jury that \u201cIt is not just the repeated contacts. It is the repeated contacts along with the statements along with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>prior history all of that plays into this. ...[][] It is not just the fact that he violated the restraining order that is element number 3 of stalking, but his overall course of conduct.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b109-5\">While the prosecutor did refer to the threat to David E as one aspect of this course of conduct, it was not the only incident forming the basis of the credible threat. When viewing the record in light of the prosecution\u2019s actual theory, it is apparent that the real issue below was whether defendant\u2019s pattern of conduct implied a credible threat to Kathryn C. and not whether the statement to David E alone constituted a threat to her. Even defense counsel characterized the threat to David F. and the immediate family issue as a \u201cred herring\u201d or \u201cnonissue.\u201d That defendant\u2019s appellate counsel, in hindsight, might have argued the matter differently cannot alter the record of what actually occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-6\">But even if we assume, without deciding, that the trial court erred by failing to instruct the jury that defendant had to know David F. qualified as Kathryn C.\u2019s immediate family member before the statements to David F. in Kathryn C.\u2019s presence could qualify as a credible threat to her, the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>(People v. Sengpadychith </em>(2001) 26 Cal.4th 316, 324 [109 Cal.Rptr.2d 851, 27 P.3d 739] [\u201ca trial court\u2019s failure to instruct on an element of a <em>crime </em>is federal constitutional error [citation] that requires reversal of the conviction unless it can be shown \u2018beyond a reasonable doubt\u2019 that the error did not contribute to the jury\u2019s verdict\u201d]; see <em>Chapman v. California </em>(1967) 386 U.S. 18, 24 [17 L.Ed.2d 705, 87 S.Ct. 824].) The evidence overwhelmingly showed that even without the threat to David F. defendant\u2019s entire course of conduct implied a credible threat to Kathryn C.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-7\">As the prosecutor reminded the jury, defendant directly threatened Kathryn C. He had an extensive history of domestic violence against Kathryn C.; he physically, mentally, and emotionally abused her. Even defense counsel conceded that defendant \u201cdid some horrible things to this woman in the past. . . Probably the most horrendous thing he did to her was when he put his arm\u2014she described it as how he was choking her.\u201d Based on their extensive domestic violence history, Kathryn C. was justifiably scared of defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-8\">Defendant repeatedly disregarded the no-contact orders, even moving in next door to Kathryn C. and seemingly watching her from his apartment. Over the course of a month, defendant contacted Kathryn C. 40 to 50 times\u2014nearly every time she left her home. He bragged about beating people up, told her someone should similarly beat her up after she asked him to leave her alone, told her she should be careful or else something was going to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>happen to her, and told her there was nothing the police could do to keep him away from her. Similar behavior has been found to constitute a credible threat within the meaning of section 646.9. (See, e.g., <em>People v. Uecker </em>(2009) 172 Cal.App.4th 583, 594-596 [91 Cal.Rptr.3d 355] <em>(Uecker) </em>[credible threat implied by defendant\u2019s conduct of following victim over seven months, placing hostile notes on her car, and positioning himself so he could see her come and go at work, and calling over 30 times in three weeks and leaving cryptic and irate messages on victim\u2019s answering machine constituted credible threat]; <em>People v. Halgren </em>(1996) 52 Cal.App.4th 1223, 1233 [61 CaI.Rptr.2d 176] [defendant\u2019s appearance at victim\u2019s work, his positioning himself where he could watch people leave the office, his repeated telephone calls insisting victim speak with defendant, and his statements that victim would pay for her rudeness and he would \u201cfix her\u201d or \u201cfix this\u201d constituted a credible threat with clear intent to place victim in fear for safety]; see also <em>People </em>v. <em>Norman </em>(1999) 75 Cal.App.4th 1234, 1241, fn. 4 [89 Cal.Rptr.2d 806] <em>(Norman) </em>[defendant\u2019s attempt to climb over wall at victim\u2019s residence, his lies about his employment and relationship with victim, and statements that he wanted to rape victim was sufficient to constitute credible threat].) On this record, we are convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that any alleged instructional error did not contribute to the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-4\">D. <em>Threats Communicated to Third Person</em></p>\n<p id=\"b110-5\">Defendant next challenges the stalking instruction because it did not inform the jury that before determining defendant\u2019s statements to Officer Fox about shooting Kathryn C. constituted a credible threat, the jury had to find defendant intended Officer Fox to convey the statements to Kathryn C. In other words, defendant again asks us to construe section 646.9 as including an additional element not expressly stated in the statute\u2014that of specifically intending that comments to third parties be conveyed to the victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-6\">While defendant concedes no published decisions have held such an imbedded intent element exists in section 646.9, other courts construing an analogous threat statute have concluded a defendant is guilty of issuing a criminal threat, based on his or her threatening statements made to a third person, only if there is at least some evidence the defendant intended the third person to relay the threatening words to the victim to accomplish the defendant\u2019s goal of instilling fear in the victim. <em>(In re David L. </em>(1991) 234 Cal.App.3d 1655, 1659 [286 Cal.Rptr. 398]; see, e.g., <em>In re Ryan D. </em>(2002) 100 Cal.App.4th 854, 861 [123 Cal.Rptr.2d 193]; <em>People v. Felix </em>(2001) 92 Cal.App.4th 905, 913-914 [112 Cal.Rptr.2d 311] <em>(Felix).) </em>To a certain extent, these cases support defendant\u2019s argument about an implicit intent to convey requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>For example, in <em>In re David L., </em>the court noted, \u201cThe kind of threat contemplated by section 422 may as readily be conveyed by the threatener through a third party as personally to the intended victim. Where the threat is conveyed through a third party intermediary, the specific intent element of the statute is implicated. Thus, if the threatener intended the threat to be taken seriously by the victim, he must necessarily have intended it to be conveyed.\u201d <em>(In re David L, supra, </em>234 Cal.App.3d at p. 1659.) The court inferred the intent that the threat be conveyed to the victim because the defendant made the statement to the victim\u2019s friend. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b111-5\">In <em>Felix, </em>the defendant made threatening statements about shooting his ex-girlfriend to a psychotherapist while in jail. Given the confidential setting in which the statements were made while discussing highly personal thoughts about homicide, suicide, and his emotions about his ex-girlfriend, the court found the requisite intent to convey lacking. <em>(Felix, supra, </em>92 Cal.App.4th at pp. 913-914.)</p>\n<p id=\"b111-6\">On the other hand, our colleagues in the Second Appellate District, albeit in a somewhat different context, determined that for purposes of a credible threat, it is irrelevant that a victim learns of a stalker\u2019s threats through a third person rather than directly from the stalker. <em>(Norman, supra, </em>75 Cal.App.4th at p. 1241, fn. 4.) There, the court considered whether a victim\u2019s fear must be contemporaneous with the stalker\u2019s threats and harassment in order to violate section 646.9. <em>(Norman, </em>at pp. 1235-1236.) Norman, the defendant, was convicted of stalking Steven Spielberg. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1235.) Spielberg was out of the country when Norman, among other things, tried to scale the wall of Spielberg\u2019s residence and admitted he wanted to rape Spielberg. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 1236-1238.) Spielberg\u2019s lawyer ultimately told Spielberg of Norman\u2019s bizarre antics and threatening conduct, which caused Spielberg to fear for the safety of himself and his family. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1237.)</p>\n<p id=\"b111-7\">In rejecting Norman\u2019s claim that insufficient evidence of a credible threat supported his conviction the court stated, \u201cThe fact that Spielberg learned about Norman\u2019s threatening conduct from Ramer [(his attorney)] is irrelevant\u2014it was Norman whose course of conduct. . . was threatening and which created a foreseeable need to inform Spielberg of the danger.\u201d <em>(Norman, supra, </em>75 Cal.App.4th at p. 1241, fn. 4.) Thus, whether a defendant intends that words uttered to third parties be relayed to the victim arguably appears irrelevant for purposes of establishing a credible threat under section 646.9. As <em>Norman </em>intimates, it is a defendant\u2019s entire course of conduct, including conduct and statements to third parties that foreseeably a victim may be told, that is relevant for establishing a credible threat and not necessarily any particular intent that the comments be conveyed to the victim. <em>(Norman, </em>at p. 1241, fn. 4.)</p>\n<p id=\"b112-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number><em>Norman's </em>conclusion is supported by other opinions that provide, \u201c \u2018in determining whether a threat occurred [under section 646.9], the entire factual context, including the surrounding events and the reaction of the listeners, must be considered.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Uecker, supra, </em>172 Cal.App.4th at p. 598, fn. 10.) As <em>Uecker </em>points out, a court \u201ccannot ignore what a victim knows about a defendant, <em>regardless of how it is learned, </em>in assessing whether a defendant\u2019s behavior rises to the level of a credible threat.\u201d <em>(Ibid., </em>italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b112-4\">In this case, Officer Fox told Kathryn C. what defendant had said. Kathryn C.\u2019s knowledge of these statements, once gained, cannot be ignored when assessing whether defendant\u2019s course of conduct rose to the level of a credible threat. <em>(Uecker, supra, </em>172 Cal.App.4th at p. 598, fn. 10.) The fact that Officer Fox conveyed the statements, whether or not defendant intended him to relay the threatening messages, appears irrelevant. <em>(Norman, supra, </em>75 Cal.App.4th at p. 1241, fn. 4.)</p>\n<p id=\"b112-5\">But even if we assume, without deciding, that defendant is correct that the trial court erred by failing to instruct the jury he had to intend for Officer Fox to convey his threatening statements to Kathryn C., we are satisfied the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>(People v. Sengpadychith, supra, </em>26 Cal.4th at p. 324.)</p>\n<p id=\"b112-6\">The record shows defendant told Officer Fox he intended to immediately return to Kathryn C.\u2019s house as soon as he was released, the restraining order \u201cdidn\u2019t mean shit,\u201d and that nothing could be done if he shot her upon his release. These comments were made to the peace officer who had just arrested defendant for violating a no-contact order after he threatened Kathryn C.\u2019s boyfriend in her presence and outside her home. This evidence is uncontradicted.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-7\">Defendant did not make the threatening statements in a confidential setting or during a therapy session. Thus, unlike in <em>Felix, </em>defendant had no expectation the statements would remain confidential. Instead, like in <em>Norman, </em>it was reasonably foreseeable under these circumstances that defendant\u2019s conduct and comments would prompt the arresting officer to inform Kathryn C. about the threatening statements. Assuming the jury had been instructed that defendant had to intend for Officer Fox to relay his threats to Kathryn C., we are confident beyond a reasonable doubt the jury would have inferred such an intent based on the uncontradicted evidence in the record. <em>(In re David L., supra, </em>234 Cal.App.3d at p. 1659 [intent that third party act as intermediary to convey threat to victim was implied]; <em>People v. Lopez </em>(1986) 188 Cal.App.3d 592, 602 [233 Cal.Rptr. 207] [uncontradicted evidence defendant knew, or exercising reasonable care should have known, police officers were attempting to arrest him].)</p>\n<p id=\"b113-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>And even had the jury found defendant did not intend for Officer Fox to convey his shooting comments to Kathryn C., defendant still fails to carry his burden to show prejudice in light of the prosecution\u2019s credible threat theory, which as discussed above, was that a credible threat against Kathryn C. could be implied from defendant\u2019s entire course of conduct rather than merely his statements to Officer Fox. <em>(Uecker, supra, </em>172 Cal.App.4th at p. 597.) The court is satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt the jury would have implied such a credible threat based on defendant\u2019s violent history and his pattern of conduct. The alleged instructional error, assuming it occurred, did not contribute to the guilty verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-5\">E. <em>Constitutionally Protected Speech</em></p>\n<p id=\"b113-6\">Defendant next contends the stalking instruction was erroneous because it did not require the jury to determine whether his statements to Officer Fox constituted free speech under the First Amendment, and that because the statements so qualified, they could not form the basis of a credible threat under section 646.9.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-7\">Our resolution of the latter issue necessarily resolves the former. We therefore consider first whether defendant\u2019s statements to Officer Fox constituted constitutionally protected free speech. We find they do not.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-8\">Section 646.9 provides that \u201c[constitutionally protected activity\u201d is not included in the statutory definitions of either \u201c \u2018course of conduct\u2019 \u201d or \u201c \u2018credible threat.\u2019 \u201d (See \u00a7 646.9, subds. (f) &amp; (g).) Thus, if defendant\u2019s statements to Officer Fox qualify as \u201cconstitutionally protected activity,\u201d they cannot form the basis of the stalking charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-9\">The First Amendment protects \u201cexpression that engages in some fashion in public dialogue, that is, \u2018 \u201ccommunication in which the participants seek to persuade, or are persuaded; communication which is about changing or maintaining beliefs, or taking or refusing to take action on the basis of one\u2019s beliefs____\u201d \u2019\u201d <em>(In re M.S. </em>(1995) 10 Cal.4th 698, 710 [42 Cal.Rptr.2d 355, 896 P.2d 1365].) \u201cAs speech strays further from the values of persuasion, dialogue and free exchange of ideas, and moves toward willful threats to perform illegal acts, the state has greater latitude to regulate expression.\u201d <em>{Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b113-12\">A threat constitutes an \u201c \u2018 \u201cexpression of an intent to inflict evil, injury, or damage on another.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>(In re M.S., supra, </em>10 Cal.4th at p. 710.) \u201cWhen a reasonable person would foresee that the context and import of the words will cause the listener to believe he or she will be subjected to physical violence, the threat falls outside First Amendment protection.\u201d <em>{Ibid.) </em>Such comments <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>are \u201cpunishable because of the state\u2019s interest in protecting individuals from the fear of violence, the disruption fear engenders and the possibility the threatened violence will occur.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 714.)</p>\n<p id=\"b114-4\">In this case, defendant told Officer Fox the restraining orders \u201cdidn\u2019t mean shit, and he was going to be out [of jail] in 20 minutes . . . and he was going to go back to [Kathryn C.\u2019s] house immediately.\u201d He also told the officer that he could not keep him away from Kathryn C. and that when he got out of jail, if he shot Kathryn C., there was nothing Officer Fox could do about it. Defendant angrily made these statements after having just been arrested for contacting Kathryn C. at her home in violation of the no-contact order and threatening her boyfriend in her presence. Given this context and based on the nature of the comments, it was reasonably foreseeable the officer would believe the victim might be subjected to physical violence at defendant\u2019s hand.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-5\">That is precisely what occurred when Officer Fox heard defendant\u2019s statements. When asked whether he was concerned or worried about the statements, Officer Fox testified, \u201cI took it very seriously that if he\u2019s going to make\u2014based on his actions up to this point and based on if he\u2019s going to make that claim to a police officer, not only once but twice, I felt it was my job to do the best I can to protect her.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b114-6\">Defendant\u2019s reliance on <em>Watts </em>v. <em>United States </em>(1969) 394 U.S. 705, 708 [22 L.Ed.2d 664, 89 S.Ct. 1399] <em>(Watts) </em>for the proposition that defendant had a First Amendment right to make \u201c 1 \u201cvehement, caustic, and sometimes unpleasantly sharp attacks on government and public officials\u201d \u2019 \u201d is misplaced. <em>Watts </em>involved a political rally at the Washington Monument in Washington, D.C., during the time of the Vietnam War. Watts, a young man attending the rally, informed a group of attendees that he had just received his draft notice and declared he would not report for duty. He then stated, \u201c \u2018If they ever make me carry a rifle the first man I want to get in my sights is L. B. J.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Watts, </em>at p. 706.) Both Watts and those that heard the statement laughed. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 707.)</p>\n<p id=\"b114-7\">In reversing Watts\u2019s conviction for threatening the president\u2019s life, the United States Supreme Court considered the context and expressly conditional nature of the statement, as well as the listener\u2019s reaction. <em>(Watts, supra, </em>394 U.S. at p. 708.) The high court concluded the statement, rather than a threat, was merely a \u201c \u2018very crude offensive method of stating a political opposition to the President.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 708.)</p>\n<p id=\"b114-8\">We find <em>Watts </em>inapt to the facts of the present case. At the time defendant made the comments about shooting Kathryn C., he was not taking part in a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>political rally against an unpopular war or the President of the United States. Instead, he had just been arrested for violating a no-contact order and had told the arresting officer that he intended immediately to return to Kathryn C.\u2019s house as soon as he was released from jail. Neither he nor Officer Fox was laughing after defendant twice said that nothing could be done if he shot Kathryn C. upon his release. Although the \u201c \u2018political hyperbole\u2019 \u201d of the sort at issue in <em>Watts </em>remains within the \u201c \u2018marketplace of ideas\u2019 \u201d protected by the First Amendment, threats to an arresting officer about physically harming a former girlfriend by shooting her do not constitute such political hyperbole. <em>(In re M.S., supra, </em>10 Cal.4th at p. 711.) Defendant\u2019s offhanded comment that the justice system was \u201cfucked up\u201d does not cloak the threat to shoot Kathryn C. in First Amendment protection. As Officer Fox\u2019s testimony reveals, the context in which the threatening statement was made conveyed a gravity of purpose so as to constitute speech beyond the pale of the First Amendment. (10 Cal.4th at p. 714 [\u201cViolence and threats of violence, by contrast, fall outside the protection of the First Amendment because they coerce by unlawful <em>conduct, </em>rather than persuade by expression, and thus play no part in the \u2018marketplace of ideas.\u2019 \u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b115-5\">Having concluded defendant was not engaged in constitutionally protected First Amendment speech when making the statements to Officer Fox, we next consider whether the trial court erred by not instructing the jury that defendant was not guilty of stalking if his conduct was a constitutionally protected activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-6\">Defendant concedes a specific instruction regarding constitutionally protected speech under CALCRIM No. 1301 is optional. Because we determined defendant was not engaged in such activity, we reject defendant\u2019s argument that the court erred in omitting any reference to constitutionally protected activity when instructing the jury on the stalking charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-7\">II-IV<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b115-8\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b115-9\">The sentences on the misdemeanor charges are stayed pursuant to section 654.
