Sklar represented plaintiffs in a class action against Toshiba America Information Systems, Inc. (Toshiba). Sklar appeals from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"856\">*856</page-number>trial court\u2019s orders awarding monetary sanctions against her and the court\u2019s order awarding her no attorney fees. Toshiba cross-appeals the order awarding staff fees to Sklar Law Offices. We affirm the order awarding monetary sanctions against Sklar, and affirm in part and reverse in part the order regarding attorney fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-4\">SUMMARY</p>\n<p id=\"b758-5\">In February 2005, Caddell &amp; Chapman, a Texas law firm with experience litigating class actions, and Sklar, a sole practitioner and a member of the California Bar doing business as Sklar Law Offices (SLO) out of her home office in Minnesota,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> filed a class action against Toshiba,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> on behalf of a class of purchasers of a Toshiba laptop computer which had an electrostatic discharge problem with the top cover. After a two-day mediation, in November 2005 Sklar and all other counsel signed a settlement term sheet, giving each class member a 12-month repair warranty extension (or, if the class member already had the extended warranty, a $35 credit voucher), and either $25 in cash or a $50 voucher for the repair to replace the defective top cover. Conflicts ensued between counsel regarding the drafting of a settlement agreement. Sklar later objected to the settlement, including an objection to the inclusion of the amount of her fees in the class notice, and the proposed settlement initially was submitted to the court without her signature in May 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-6\">After further negotiations, Sklar filed a motion for preliminary approval of the settlement in August 2006. In an attached declaration, Sklar stated that she would seek legal fees of more than $24.7 million (represented as 25 percent of a settlement value placed at $98,975,862),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> to be apportioned between Sklar and Caddell &amp; Chapman, plus expenses of $99,750. Toshiba filed a declaration by counsel stating that it had agreed not to oppose the application by Caddell &amp; Chapman for $1,125,000 in fees, but Toshiba intended to take discovery into the basis of Sklar\u2019s \u201cexorbitant\u201d fee request, and would seek the production of documents and the depositions of Sklar and others, including Sklar\u2019s expert.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-7\">The trial court granted preliminary approval of the settlement in October 2006. The class notice, disseminated in October and November 2006, stated: \u201cSklar Law Offices will ask the Court for attorneys\u2019 fees in the amount of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"857\">*857</page-number>$24,743,965.50, less whatever the Court awards Caddell &amp; Chapman for its attorneys\u2019 fees. Sklar Law Offices will ask for litigation expenses in the amount of $114,900. Toshiba will oppose these requests.\u201d In May 2007, the court granted final approval and entered judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-4\">In January 2008 the trial court awarded Caddell &amp; Chapman $1.05 million in attorney fees and $75,000 in costs, for a total of $1,125,000. Sklar\u2019s initial fee petition, filed later in January 2008, requested fees of either $7,847,362.50 under a lodestar/multipher approach, or $24,743,965.50 as a percentage of the settlement value, and $410,383.53 in expenses (this time for Sklar alone). Sklar\u2019s subsequent fee application in October 2009 requested fees of $12,079,534.69, plus expenses for SLO of $905,752.72.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-5\">As promised, Toshiba opposed Sklar\u2019s fee request, and protracted litigation and many discovery disputes followed Sklar\u2019s initial fee estimate in 2006. On August 31, 2009, the trial court granted Toshiba\u2019s motion for monetary sanctions against Sklar in the amount of $165,000 for fees and costs Toshiba incurred related to Sklar\u2019s failure to comply with court discovery orders and her failure to meet and confer in good faith. Sklar appealed, and the sanctions order is the subject of appeal No. B220286.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-6\">On June 30, 2010, the trial court issued a 27-page ruling awarding SLO $176,900 in fees (for work during the merits phase of the class action by the staff of SLO), and awarding nothing for Sklar\u2019s work; subtracting the $165,000 sanctions award, the net award to SLO was $11,900. Sklar appealed the order denying attorney fees, Toshiba cross-appealed from the award of fees for work by SLO staff, and the fee award is the subject of appeal No. B227078.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-7\">We consolidated the two appeals. For the reasons detailed below, we affirm the order awarding monetary sanctions against Sklar, and affirm in part and reverse in part the order regarding attorney fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-8\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b759-9\">I. <em>Sklar disobeyed the court order to allow forensic computer inspections, and the trial court imposed monetary sanctions.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b759-10\">We describe in some detail the arduous procedural history of Toshiba\u2019s attempt to obtain discovery of electronically stored information regarding Sklar\u2019s request for attorney fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"858\">*858</page-number>A. <em>Toshiba sought Sklar\u2019s electronic billing records.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b760-4\">After the preliminary approval of the settlement in October 2006, Toshiba began to seek discovery, including document production and Sklar\u2019s deposition, related to Sklar\u2019s August 2006 statement that she would make a fee request of over $24 million. Among other items, Toshiba sought an electronic, searchable copy of time records Sklar had produced in hard copy. Toshiba characterized those records as showing that Sklar worked on the class action \u201cnearly all day (sometimes as much as 16.75 hours), every day, seven days a week, including holidays, for some 22 months.\u201d Toshiba served subpoenas in October 2006 and January 2007, each of which sought computer data and files related to time billed by Sklar or SLO in the class action. In response, Sklar produced a compact disc (CD) containing Portable Document Format (PDF) copies of the time records, which on appeal she characterizes as \u201credacted to protect attorney-client and work product privileges.\u201d Toshiba continued to request a searchable electronic copy of Sklar\u2019s time records.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-5\">The trial court held a hearing on January 26, 2007, on Sklar\u2019s objections to Toshiba\u2019s discovery requests, asking Sklar\u2019s counsel and Sklar: \u201c[D]o you really think that I\u2019m going to allow this to proceed and give Ms. Sklar the benefit of $24 million in fees without having her be deposed, without having her produce any documents?\u201d Given that Sklar\u2019s fee request included time records showing she worked \u201cup to 16-hour days seven days a week for a number of weeks,\u201d the court stated that Sklar would have to produce time records which were not redacted. Sklar\u2019s counsel argued that the records were complete; counsel for Toshiba rejoined that Sklar had represented that the time records were redacted, and Toshiba was unable to tell what had been excised. The court responded: \u201cI\u2019m not going to take your [(Sklar\u2019s)] word for it, I must tell you. . . . [N]ot with this kind of a request. The amount of money you want is staggering, and I think it has to be . . . scrutinized . . . before I approve this kind of an award.\u201d Allowing that \u201c[a]t the end of the day I may award [Sklar] every penny,\u201d the court emphasized that Toshiba had the right to verify both that the time records showed what Sklar actually did, and that the claimed attorney time did not represent something that could have been done by a secretary or paralegal.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-6\">Counsel for Toshiba requested that the electronic version of the time records be produced \u201cin its native format in the program it was used or at least something . . . searchable.\u201d The trial court ordered Sklar to appear for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"859\">*859</page-number>deposition and to produce the electronic time records in \u201cnative format,\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>and told Sklar\u2019s counsel to hire an \u201cI.T. expert\u201d or consultant to redact any privileged information.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-5\">Toshiba\u2019s counsel subsequently wrote to Sklar\u2019s counsel to clarify that \u201c[njative format is the format[s] in which the documents were originally created and maintained, including all metadata1^ associated with those files.\u201d Sklar then produced a CD-ROM containing a set of Microsoft Word files of Sklar\u2019s time records, which were searchable versions of the time records produced in hard copy, with none of the metadata associated with the original files. Sklar\u2019s counsel explained that at the time of the October subpoena the time records only existed in Adobe Acrobat form and had no associated metadata, and the Microsoft Word files were the time records as they existed at the time of the subpoena.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-6\">At Sklar\u2019s deposition in March 2007, she testified that before she produced the time records (including around the end of 2006), she had converted the records into Adobe format, deleting the original Word files using a program called \u201cWipe and Delete.\u201d Sklar had used this program daily to eliminate metadata. As a result, it was not possible to tell when or how often Sklar created time records, among other things.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-7\">After Sklar\u2019s deposition, Toshiba requested that Sklar allow Toshiba\u2019s expert to inspect Sklar\u2019s computers (at Sklar\u2019s expense) to determine whether it was possible to recover any of the deleted files and metadata. Sklar refused.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"860\">*860</page-number>B. <em>Toshiba filed a motion for sanctions regarding Sklar\u2019s destruction of her original electronic billing records.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b762-4\">Toshiba then filed a motion for sanctions in June 2007. The motion argued that Sklar had destroyed (deleted) files and records that were responsive to the trial court\u2019s January 26, 2007 order requiring that Sklar produce her time records in their native format. Toshiba requested that its forensic computer expert be allowed to inspect Sklar\u2019s computers to determine whether the original time record files could be recovered. If Toshiba could not recover the original time record files, Sklar would have \u201cpurposely destroyed the evidence of how and when her time records were created and edited,\u201d warranting terminating sanctions or, alternatively, an order prohibiting Sklar from introducing her time records to support her fee request. Toshiba argued that at a minimum the trial court should impose issue sanctions and should determine conclusively that Sklar did not prepare her time records contemporaneously with her work on the case, that Sklar\u2019s time records did not accurately reflect the time she claimed to have billed, and that Sklar had not been precluded from taking on other work during the pendency of the class action. Toshiba also requested monetary sanctions of $25,000, less than half the attorney fees Toshiba had incurred in its efforts to obtain Sklar\u2019s electronic files.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-5\">In a declaration attached to her opposition, Sklar stated that she had no obligation to produce metadata and that backups of the original Word time record files on this case were maintained. She also claimed that her testimony at the deposition (that she had deleted the original files altogether) was limited to a computer she had to return and replace. Sklar understood \u201cnative format\u201d to mean \u201cthe software program and version used to create the document,\u201d which \u201cusually does not include metadata.\u201d After the court\u2019s January 26, 2007 order Sklar converted her time records (which by then existed in hardcopies and PDF format) <em>back </em>into Word format, with redactions for privileged information and \u201clittle or no metadata.\u201d Sklar believed that producing those redacted Word files (not the originals) complied with the court\u2019s order. Because Toshiba\u2019s requests did not specifically ask for meta-data, Sklar argued in her opposition brief that it was sufficient to produce a searchable version of her time records, and added: \u201cIn any event, SLO could not have produced what did not exist, and thus, could not have produced metadata that had been removed pursuant to ordinary business practice long before [Toshiba] sought electronic records of any sort.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b762-6\">In reply, Toshiba argued that Sklar\u2019s claim that she possessed backup files of her time records contradicted her deposition testimony, and that she had an obligation to preserve the original files (including the metadata showing when and how often Sklar entered her time).</p>\n<p id=\"b763-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"861\">*861</page-number>C. <em>The court ordered Sklar to allow forensic inspection of her computers.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b763-4\">At the August 15, 2007 hearing on Toshiba\u2019s motion for sanctions, the trial court stated: \u201cWhen I said produce native format, I wasn\u2019t thinking about metadata one way or the other,\u201d and noted that Toshiba\u2019s subpoena said nothing about metadata. Counsel for Toshiba pointed out that the metadata no longer existed at the time of the order in January 2007, because Sklar had already removed the metadata from the time files. The court agreed: \u201cSo it\u2019s not a question of her violating my order with respect to metadata. . . . What I\u2019m concerned about is this is a person who wants $22 million and some change in legal fees, knows when she starts preparing . . . timesheets, . . . knows that this will be the heart and soul of her claim for attorney fees and does not preserve the early drafts.\u201d The court declined to say that \u201cmetadata is included in native format.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b763-5\">Nevertheless, the court stated that in the context of a request for class action attorney fees, \u201cit is extremely poor judgment to wipe and delete an original file of your timesheets.\u201d When Sklar\u2019s counsel protested that Sklar had not deleted any time records, the court stated: \u201cWell, we\u2019re going to find out because I\u2019m going to appoint an expert to search her hard drives.\u201d The expert would be of Toshiba\u2019s choosing and at Toshiba\u2019s expense, although if the expert determined that the time records were not contemporaneous with the work claimed, the cost would be shifted to Sklar which \u201cwill only be my first step.\u201d Sklar\u2019s counsel claimed that the backup of the original Word file was in Minnesota, but contained privileged information. The trial court responded that Sklar had testified that she had wiped and deleted the original Word file, and \u201cI think she\u2019s really misleading me. I\u2019m beginning to get very upset with this.\u201d The court believed \u201cthe backup has metadata on it. I\u2019ll bet you anything.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b763-6\">The trial court ordered that the parties select a neutral expert to search the backup file and produce anything that was not privileged, reserving a ruling whether any relevant privileges were waived. The court also reserved the issue of monetary sanctions: \u201cI tend to think that you [(Toshiba)] are going to be entitled to something, but I want to see what happens with the metadata, with the backup file. But I will tell you that the testimony in the deposition coupled with the briefs coupled with the behavior here is such that I probably could conclude by a preponderance of the evidence that this has constituted a discovery abuse under [section] 2023[.010]<footnotemark>[6]</footnotemark> of the Code of Civil Procedure, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"862\">*862</page-number>and I think that Toshiba is going to be entitled to a monetary sanction. . . . [][] . . . [][] There just seems to be kind of a shifting series of explanations which concerns me deeply.\u201d \u201c[R]ight now I want to get on to the table what Ms. Sklar has that comes as close as possible to being an original file of these timesheets .... Everything else I\u2019m reserving.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b764-4\">The notice of ruling and the August 15, 2007 minute order required Sklar to agree on a neutral expert with Toshiba, splitting the cost. Within 30 days of the expert\u2019s selection, the neutral expert was to search the backup files. During the same time period, Sklar was to permit an expert selected and paid by Toshiba to search Sklar\u2019s hard drives to recover time record files, including metadata, related to the class action. Sklar objected to the notice of ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-5\">Sklar brought a motion for reconsideration of the August 15, 2007 order, which Toshiba opposed. At a hearing on October 2, 2007, Sklar\u2019s counsel argued that \u201cmetadata for time records in a Word document that is supplemented over time ... by a lawyer in a class counsel case is not reliable and is never going to be relevant. And because it\u2019s not reliable, its discovery couldn\u2019t possibly lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.\u201d Counsel for Toshiba countered that if any metadata were recovered, its relevance would then be determined: \u201cthis is the kind of thing we don\u2019t know until we get there.\u201d The court agreed. The court denied the motion on the ground that it did not meet the standard for reconsideration; in addition, the court reaffirmed its August 15, 2007 ruling on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-6\">Sklar also brought an ex parte application to stay the order, which the court denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"863\">*863</page-number>D. <em>The parties could not agree on a neutral expert or establish a protocol for inspection by Toshiba\u2019s expert.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b765-4\">In an e-mail to Sklar\u2019s counsel late in September 2007, Toshiba\u2019s counsel mentioned Kroll OnTrack, Inc. (Kroll), as a possible neutral expert to examine the backup files. Sklar\u2019s counsel sent Toshiba a suggested protocol for Toshiba\u2019s inspection in October 2007, after Sklar\u2019s motions for reconsideration and for stay were denied, but Toshiba declined in part because the protocol limited the inspection to one hard drive and restricted communications between Toshiba and its own expert.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Further exchanges followed. Before any specifics were established, on January 31, 2008, Sklar filed a voluminous fee petition, seeking a fee hearing on February 29, 2008, without completion of the court-ordered inspections. Sklar\u2019s petition requested $24,743,965.50 plus expenses if fees were calculated as 25 percent of the settlement value, or $7,847,362.50 plus $410,383.53 in expenses under the lodestar approach. The trial court continued the hearing and eventually took it off calendar.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-5\">On March 12, 2008, Toshiba sent a letter to Sklar stating that in spite of numerous followup inquiries, Sklar had yet to accept or reject Kroll or propose another neutral expert. Toshiba planned to submit Kroll\u2019s name to the court on March 14 as a proposed neutral expert, unless it heard back from Sklar. Sklar then told Toshiba\u2019s counsel (also in Mar. 2008) that she would not agree to Kroll because Kroll had done work for Toshiba\u2019s former counsel. Toshiba attempted to schedule an inspection, but Sklar conditioned the inspection on the entering of a protective order. Subsequently, in a status conference statement filed on March 28, 2008, Sklar stated that she had retained Kroll as her consultant.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-6\">The court entered a formal stipulated protective order on April 24, 2008, providing that the party to whom any electronic information was produced could not argue that the production waived any claims of privacy, confidentiality, or privilege by the producing party.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-7\">At a status conference on May 8, 2008, Toshiba explained that after it suggested Kroll as the neutral expert to examine the backup files, Sklar had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"864\">*864</page-number>retained Kroll. Sklar admitted that she retained Kroll as a consultant, but denied that she consulted Kroll after Toshiba proposed Kroll as an expert. Sklar\u2019s counsel represented that Kroll was retained before the September 2007 letter from Toshiba, and the court stated: \u201cI\u2019m afraid you\u2019re going to have to give me some records to establish that.\u201d As for Toshiba\u2019s expert inspecting Sklar\u2019s hard drive for the deleted files, Sklar\u2019s counsel suggested that the court did not have jurisdiction over Sklar as a Minnesota resident to make its August 15, 2007 order, and the court reacted angrily: \u201cYou\u2019re telling me you\u2019re not going to obey. You\u2019re telling me I don\u2019t have jurisdiction. You\u2019re telling me the order is wrong. You\u2019re telling me all sorts of things, everything other than you intend to comply.\u201d Sklar\u2019s counsel expressed concern about protecting privileged information. The court stated that Toshiba\u2019s expert was to pull only Sklar\u2019s time record files associated with the class action. The court warned Sklar that if the electronic time records were not disclosed, the court would consider the time records that Sklar had produced earlier as weaker evidence produced when stronger evidence was available. The court urged the parties to agree on a protocol for Toshiba\u2019s inspection, follow the court\u2019s suggestion, or contact the court for assistance.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-4\">E. <em>The court ordered the inspections by Toshiba\u2019s expert to occur on July 22 and 23, 2008.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b766-5\">At a status conference on June 24, 2008, the trial court expressed exasperation with the \u201cmorass of charge and countercharge\u201d regarding the fee request and the lack of progress with discovery. The inspections had not been done and Sklar\u2019s deposition had not been completed. The court warned that if it decided that Sklar had violated its order regarding her deposition, \u201cI\u2019m just going to deny her all her fees, and that will be the end of this.\u201d The court ordered the completion of Sklar\u2019s deposition in Minnesota on July 24 and 25, and again stated, \u201cI will award you zero for this class action\u201d if Sklar interposed \u201ca string of objections and speech-making during the deposition.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b766-6\">Turning to the inspections, the court ordered Toshiba\u2019s inspection to take place on July 22 and 23, also in Minnesota. As to the selection of a neutral expert, Sklar\u2019s counsel admitted that he could not pinpoint when Sklar contacted Kroll. Toshiba\u2019s counsel disputed Sklar\u2019s assertion that she had contacted Kroll and provided Kroll with privileged information, before Toshiba suggested in September 2007 that Kroll serve as the neutral. The court declined to \u201cassignQ blame on either side\u201d and concluded \u201cwe just need another neutral,\u201d directing the parties each to submit a few neutrals for the court to select one. \u201cI\u2019ll find a neutral, but I do want at least Toshiba\u2019s expert to be able to run this inspection during the week you\u2019re all back in Minneapolis. So that inspection I want to happen.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b767-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"865\">*865</page-number>The June 24, 2008 minute order stated that Toshiba\u2019s expert\u2019s inspection of Sklar\u2019s computers would take place on July 22 and 23.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-4\">F. <em>Sklar refused to allow the ordered inspection to proceed.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b767-5\">Sklar sought writ relief from the court-ordered inspection and from her deposition. The Court of Appeal summarily denied the writ on July 17, 2008. The next day, July 18, Toshiba sent an e-mail regarding the procedure for the inspection by Toshiba\u2019s expert on July 22 and 23, proposing: \u201cAs we have discussed in the past, the first step is to make an image of the hard drive(s)\u201d for offsite inspection by the expert at his offices with Sklar present, if she desired. Sklar responded three days later on July 21, the day before the ordered inspection, stating: \u201c[K]nowing that it is now your expert\u2019s intention to image my hard drives, the inspection will not proceed. Contrary to your false assertion, we have never discussed or contemplated that my hard drives would be imaged, let alone removed off site by any expert,\u201d and the court had not ruled that an image of the hard drive could be taken. (As explained above, Sklar\u2019s own initial protocol for the inspection sent to Toshiba\u2019s counsel on Oct. 19, 2007, had included imaging by SLO of the Hewlett Packard hard drive used by SLO to create the time records produced by Sklar in Feb. 2007, although inspection of the image was to be at SLO\u2019s offices.) Toshiba replied that it would address the last-minute cancellation with the court and intended to proceed with Sklar\u2019s deposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-6\">At a hearing on July 28, 2008, Toshiba\u2019s counsel stated that Sklar cancelled the inspection hours before one counsel was on a plane and when Toshiba\u2019s experts were about to head to the airport. Counsel explained that the imaging of Sklar\u2019s hard drive would make the inspection less disruptive, allowing inspection of the image without having to view the hard drive itself. The parties disputed whether the parties had agreed Toshiba could image Sklar\u2019s hard drive. Sklar\u2019s counsel stated that imaging \u201cwas totally contrary to any protocol that has been discussed,\u201d and the previous order gave Toshiba\u2019s expert two days to go through the hard drive and look for metadata. The court then stated that Toshiba\u2019s expert could go to Minnesota and work on the hard drive itself with \u201cfree and unfettered access to the hard drive,\u201d and added that as far as an order for inspection goes \u201cI\u2019m beginning to conclude [the problem] lies with [Sklar], [f] . . . [f] I\u2019m going to issue an order to show cause as to why I should not draw a negative inference from the failure of your office to permit any inspection whatsoever of your computer drives by any expert, be it a neutral or Toshiba\u2019s expert, [f] And the negative inference I would draw is that the hard copy time records ... are not accurate and that conflicting information and perhaps contradictory information is available on the hard drive of your computer. And I will consider that negative inference in connection with your fee petition.\u201d The court set the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"866\">*866</page-number>order to show cause (OSC) hearing for September 10, and stated that Sklar could discharge the OSC by providing a \u201creal opportunity\u201d for inspection by the experts. In the court\u2019s view, \u201cit appears that the plaintiffs have really done everything they can to frustrate the purpose. And even after the writ was denied, it seems at the last minute they came in with more subterfuges.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b768-4\">In opposition to the OSC, Sklar stated: \u201c[T]here is substantial justification and good cause for Sklar\u2019s refusal to permit the inspection to proceed,\u201d based on Toshiba\u2019s rejection of Sklar\u2019s \u201cattempt to propose a reasonable protocol\u201d and insistence on imaging her hard drive for inspection elsewhere. \u201cIf this is to be the Court\u2019s order, then Sklar again requests a written order so that she may seek appellate review of the Court\u2019s decision.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b768-5\">At the OSC hearing on September 10, 2008, the court stated that \u201cdespite all of the statements I made regarding the metadata, and having an expert image Ms. Sklar\u2019s hard drive, it just hasn\u2019t happened. I made orders to that effect and it hasn\u2019t happened.\u201d Acknowledging Sklar\u2019s privacy and privilege concerns, the court noted that given the \u201cextraordinarily high amount of money\u201d requested, \u201cMs. Sklar, it\u2019s understood that any supporting evidence should have been preserved and it wasn\u2019t.\u201d Rather than draw any conclusions, the court informed the parties that because Sklar failed to produce better evidence, the court as the finder of fact would draw a negative inference as to the reliability of the time records produced by Sklar, applying CACI No. 203 and CACI No. 204 when reviewing Sklar\u2019s fee application.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Toshiba reiterated that it planned to file a motion for monetary sanctions. The court ruled that the OSC had not been discharged.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-6\">G. <em>Toshiba filed a motion for monetary sanctions against Sklar, and the court awarded Toshiba $165,000.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b768-7\">Toshiba filed its motion for monetary sanctions in March 2009, arguing that Sklar\u2019s destruction of the electronic time files and her subsequent conduct had resulted in a year of motions, discovery, briefings, argument, and attempts to agree to a neutral inspector and proceed with the court-ordered inspection, \u201call of which Sklar resisted.\u201d Toshiba requested monetary sanctions of \u201cat least $217,317.\u201d In opposition, Sklar argued that her opposition to the inspection was reasonable and that the inspection would have violated privileges and privacy. Sklar also argued that Toshiba had never requested metadata, so that its absence could not be a basis for the imposition of sanctions.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"867\">*867</page-number>At the hearing on the sanctions motion on April 24, 2009, the court asked whether there had been an inspection of Sklar\u2019s hard drive by Toshiba\u2019s expert and whether there had been an inspection by a neutral expert to produce the alleged backup files, as required by its two prior orders. Sklar\u2019s counsel responded that neither inspection had occurred, and the court rejoined, \u201cIt sounds to me at this point as though my orders have been violated.\u201d The court reiterated that it would take into account CACI No. 203 and CACI No. 204, and that \u201cit looks as though by a preponderance of the evidence that evidence has been withheld or suppressed.\u201d Turning to the question of how much Toshiba should be reimbursed \u201cbecause the orders just weren\u2019t complied with,\u201d the court indicated that it would not consider time Toshiba spent dealing with the metadata. \u201cTo the extent you are making motions because Ms. Sklar violated my orders for inspection by the [Toshiba] expert and by a neutral expert, you are entitled to your costs and attorney\u2019s fees. [][] To the extent money fees were expended regarding her failure to preserve meta data, I [am] not going to sanction her. . . . [][] But if I order an expert to go look at the file, even if all that person is going to find is meta data, that order should be complied with. It should have been observed. I made the order and ... it was violated. . . .\u201d The court clarified that the sanction would be imposed under section 2023.010.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-4\">Counsel for Sklar objected that there had been no order imposing a protocol for the inspections, so that Sklar was substantially justified in disobeying the court\u2019s orders. The court rejoined: \u201cLet me tell you something, the record in this case is one of obfuscation and delay by the plaintiff, [f] And it constitutes a violation of at least two of my orders.\u201d The court advised Toshiba that the revised sanctions request could be submitted by way of a revised declaration.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-5\">At the final hearing on Toshiba\u2019s sanctions request on July 9, 2009, the court repeated, \u201cI\u2019m not going to sanction Ms. Sklar for anything involving the meta data, but the rest of it is on the table.\u201d Sklar\u2019s counsel admitted that Sklar knew about the August 15, 2007 minute order, but argued that the minute order was not sufficiently clear. The court rejoined, \u201cThe minute order suffices.\u201d Sklar\u2019s counsel then challenged the revised declaration from Toshiba\u2019s counsel regarding time spent, because Toshiba did not attach the attorneys\u2019 time records; the court responded that he would order Toshiba to produce the time records, redacted for privilege, if Sklar would pay Toshiba\u2019s costs for the redaction.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-6\">The court granted the motion for monetary sanctions, citing in support section 2023.010, subdivisions (d), (e), (f), and (g). The court indicated that it would impose sanctions of $165,000, deductible from any amount that Sklar received when the court determined her application for attorney fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"868\">*868</page-number>In an order filed August 31, 2009, the court imposed monetary sanctions of $165,000 against Sklar and in favor of Toshiba for \u201cmisuse of the discovery process, including under . . . section[] 2023.010[, subdivision] (d), 2023.010\u00cd, subdivision] (e), 2023.010[, subdivision] (f), and 2023.010[, subdivision] (g),\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> including, among other things: \u201c[flailing, without substantial justification, to comply with this Court\u2019s August 15, 2007 and June 24, 2008 Orders on the forensic inspection of Sklar\u2019s computers\u201d; and \u201c[flailing to meet-and-confer in good faith regarding both of the Court-ordered inspections.\u201d Sklar\u2019s appeal in No. B220286 followed. The sanctions order is directly appealable, as it exceeds $5,000. (\u00a7904.1, subd. (a)(12).) The interim order awarding sanctions is also appealable because a final judgment has been rendered in the fee litigation, in which the sanctioned behavior occurred. (See <em>In re Marriage of Niklas </em>(1989) 211 Cal.App.3d 28, 36, fn. 4 [258 Cal.Rptr. 921].)</p>\n<p id=\"b770-4\">II. <em>After continued litigation, the trial court awarded fees to Sklar\u2019s staff only.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b770-5\">\n<em>A. Depositions, hearings, and motions to enforce the settlement agreement followed while the fee petition was pending.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b770-6\">At the April 24, 2009 hearing, counsel for Toshiba requested that the court allow two more days of Sklar\u2019s deposition to address \u201cspecific time entries\u201d regarding Sklar\u2019s fee requests. The court granted Toshiba two more days, with the deposition to be completed by June 30, 2009.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-7\">Sklar\u2019s deposition continued in Minnesota on June 23 and 24, 2009. On each of the two days, Sklar produced a box of documents for the first time, containing what she represented were handwritten time records and other documents in support of her fee petition. Toshiba returned to court to argue that it had sought those documents by subpoena since 2006. On July 9, 2009, the trial court set an OSC hearing, ordering Sklar to show cause why she should not be barred from using the documents to support her fee petition. After a hearing on August 24, 2009, the court ordered that Sklar\u2019s deposition would resume in September 2009, with the first day at Sklar\u2019s expense. Sklar was ordered to bring the originals of the documents to the deposition for inspection by Toshiba\u2019s expert, and if Sklar did not go forward with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"869\">*869</page-number>deposition and document inspection, Sklar would be barred from using the documents in support of her fee petition. Sklar did not appear for the deposition or produce the original documents.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-4\">Toshiba also sought to depose Susan Goldstein, Sklar\u2019s sister and a member of SLO\u2019s staff, who had purportedly billed more than 6,000 hours. These efforts, including subpoenas, eventually resulted in Goldstein\u2019s deposition in May 2009. Toshiba was able to take the deposition of Barry Voss, a Minnesota lawyer who submitted a declaration stating that Sklar\u2019s involvement in the class action prevented her from working on other cases, only after moving to compel Voss\u2019s deposition after Sklar and Voss filed written objections the day before the deposition was originally scheduled, stating that Voss would not appear.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-5\">Sklar\u2019s August 2006 fee request included a declaration from Attorney Harvey Rosen regarding the value of the settlement (Rosen estimated the value to be $98,975,862) and an affidavit from Professor Arthur Miller supporting the amount of fees requested (and using Rosen\u2019s estimate of the settlement value). Toshiba encountered difficulties in scheduling the depositions of Sklar\u2019s experts. A month before Rosen\u2019s deposition in August 2009, Sklar withdrew him as an expert in the fee matter, and her counsel represented in an e-mail that Sklar did not intend to cite his declaration in support of the fee petition.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> At Professor Miller\u2019s deposition in August 2009, he produced what Sklar herself described as \u201c7000+ Pages of Documents,\u201d most of which were responsive to a request Toshiba had made in April 2008 for material related to communications between Sklar and Professor Miller.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-6\">While the litigation and discovery disputes related to Sklar\u2019s attorney fees request continued, Sklar also filed multiple motions to enforce the settlement agreement, all of which alleged that Toshiba had breached the agreement and all of which were denied. Sklar wanted to communicate with the class without proceeding through the claims administrator and at Toshiba\u2019s expense; on June 24, 2008, the court deferred a ruling (\u201cMs. Sklar, unless and until you show a breach of the agreement, I\u2019m not ordering them to pay for communication between you and the class.\u201d). As the court said to Sklar in a hearing on July 28, 2008, before denying the motion without prejudice, \u201cYou want me to enforce a settlement agreement involving hundreds of thousands of people, and you don\u2019t give me the evidence. It may be that [Toshiba\u2019s counsel] know about [issues that class members had with the settlement]. But <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"870\">*870</page-number>I don\u2019t know that they know. You have given me no evidence to that regard.\u201d On December 18, 2008, the court commented \u201c[y]ou\u2019ve essentially put the same evidence in front of me and I see no difference this time around. I still don\u2019t see evidence of a breach,\u201d and ruled that Sklar would have to pay the cost and proceed through the class administrator. When Sklar once again filed a motion for a second class notice in November 2009, this time to notify the class that Sklar sought almost a million dollars more in costs than the maximum amount represented in the first class notice, the court stated at the hearing in April 2010 that the agreement was very clear that no extra costs were allowed, and denied Sklar\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-4\">B. <em>The court held a hearing on Sklar\u2019s fee petition.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b772-5\">Sklar\u2019s motion for attorney fees, filed October 28, 2009, requested \u201cfees of up to $12,079,534.69 and expenses in an amount of $905,752.72,\u201d and reserved the right to make a future application for additional fees and expenses. Sklar based the requested fee award on her lodestar with a multiplier of 2 before the effective date of the settlement agreement (May 5, 2008) plus \u201creasonable incurred costs\u201d and a 1.75 enhancement on fees thereafter.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-6\">The court heard the fee motion on April 5, 2010. Sklar began by stating \u201cthere\u2019s never been a claim for 20 some-million dollars\u201d in fees, and \u201cI have never asked for more than what is set forth in my fee petition[:] [f] . . . [1] roughly $12 million.\u201d Asked by the court why the class notice gave the higher amount of $24 million, Sklar answered that she had calculated that number using Rosen\u2019s valuation (since withdrawn) and an \u201calternative methodology\u201d: \u201cI don\u2019t think there was any intent at the time other than being able to provide ... the maximum value that could be sought as a methodology for the court\u2019s determination as set forth in the settlement agreement.\u201d Her current request was lodestar-based rather than based on a valuation of the class settlement. The court responded: \u201c[Toshiba] is saying that . . . your original requests] were so grossly inflated as to justify an award of nothing now. And I must tell you, Ms. Sklar, that argument is finding a responsive chord with me. I\u2019m not even sure $12 million is appropriate in this case. That too may be very excessive.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b772-7\">The court denied Sklar\u2019s request for an updated notice to the class specifying additional costs beyond the maximum of $114,900 in the original class notice. Turning to Sklar\u2019s fee request, the court stated: \u201cI think there\u2019s a basis to deny all fees altogether.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Sklar\u2019s time records seemed \u201cgrossly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"871\">*871</page-number>exaggerated,\u201d much of what she did appeared to be work more suited for paralegals, and \u201cthe case law justifies a complete denial of fees if a fee request is overinflated.\u201d The case had not been complicated when it settled and the parties quickly reached an agreement, at which time Sklar initially sought more than $24 million (as a percentage of the value of the settlement); then Sklar settled on a lodestar approach, generating timesheets that had her working around the clock, which the court \u201cha[d] trouble believing.\u201d Toshiba\u2019s counsel stated that Caddell &amp; Chapman had taken the lead on the litigation, not Sklar. The court noted that Sklar had billed 900 hours for investigation by the time the case was filed, and pointed out discrepancies between her written timeslips and her summary table submitted with the fee request. Toshiba\u2019s counsel then represented to the court that Sklar had lodged those handwritten records contrary to a court order excluding them unless Toshiba could have them forensically examined.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-4\">The court read from Sklar\u2019s exhibits to the petition for fees and cited her claims that Sklar worked on the case from December 21 to 27, 2004, New Year\u2019s Eve 2004, and New Year\u2019s Day 2005, every day, for eight, nine, or 10 hours a day, stating \u201cat some point it goes over the top,\u201d and suggesting that the claimed hours were not reasonable. The court found the declaration of Toshiba\u2019s expert, Professor William Rubenstein, much more convincing than that of Sklar\u2019s expert, Professor Arthur Miller, \u201cwho apparently only looked at one side of the story.\u201d The court gave Sklar 10 days to submit Professor Miller\u2019s deposition transcript and other briefing, after which the fee matter would be submitted. Two days later, Sklar elected not to file further evidence and requested that the matter be submitted for decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-5\">C. <em>The court denied Sklar\u2019s petition for attorney fees and awarded $176,900 for the work of SLO staff.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b773-6\">The court issued its meticulous 27-page opinion on June 30, 2010, and we summarize its detailed reasoning.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-7\">1. <em>The merits phase</em></p>\n<p id=\"b773-8\">First, the court cited Sklar\u2019s original fee request of over $24.74 million, made at the conclusion of the merits phase of the class action (preceding the motion for preliminary approval of the settlement) and again in her first fee petition in January 2008 (including a multiplied lodestar of $1,269,012 for work related to the fee request). Noting that Sklar\u2019s January 2008 petition therefore requested a fee amount of approximately $23.47 million for the merits phase of the case, the court compared that amount to the fee request before the court at the April 2010 hearing, in which petition Sklar requested $12,079,534.69 for all phases of the case. Sklar had repeatedly denied having <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"872\">*872</page-number>asked for $24 million in fees, and her \u201cdissembling and outright distortions\u201d \u201cha[ve] seriously damaged her credibility with this Court.\u201d The court therefore doubted her word on her purported lodestar, and her \u201creduction by over half of the fees SLO originally requested calls into serious question the legitimacy of her numbers. One raises an eyebrow upon learning that work she once said was worth over $23 million now deserves a lodestar of only $3.3 million.<footnotemark>[12]</footnotemark> Indeed a court would be justified in denying outright SLO\u2019s fee request for this reason alone,\u201d citing <em>Serrano </em>v. <em>Unruh </em>(1982) 32 Cal.3d 621, 635 [186 Cal.Rptr. 754, 652 P.2d 985],</p>\n<p id=\"b774-4\">The court also described Sklar\u2019s behavior during the pendency of her fee applications, concluding that she improperly resisted Toshiba\u2019s efforts to inspect and verify her time record and violated two discovery orders (the subject of the sanctions). Applying the negative inferences in CACI No. 203, the court concluded that SLO\u2019s \u201cconfusing, suspect summaries and disorganized, incomplete handwritten notes\u201d were weaker evidence of her time records where stronger evidence was available. CACI No. 204 allowed the court to consider whether a party intentionally concealed or destroyed evidence, and \u201cSklar concealed and destroyed evidence. . . . The Court concludes that the records Ms. Sklar never produced would have shown that she devoted less time to this matter than she claims to have spent.\u201d Sklar\u2019s numerous accusations of unethical behavior against other participants (including the trial court) were inappropriate and unprofessional behavior, which also justified a denial of fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-5\">The court addressed Sklar\u2019s claimed time and fees during the merits phase (3,600 hours, or 27 percent of the total), from Sklar\u2019s discovery of the laptop defect when she purchased one for personal use in October 2004, through her investigation of the defect, her association with Caddell &amp; Chapman, the filing of the class action in February 2005, and up until the agreement to settle with Toshiba, reached in April 2006. Noting that \u201c[t]he facts of this class action are not difficult,\u201d the court acknowledged that Sklar helped to identify the defect and collected evidence and associated cocounsel, \u201cactivities [which] undoubtedly created value for the class and may have constituted the <em>sine qua non </em>for this class action.\u201d Nevertheless, the court found that \u201cSklar\u2019s billing records are, for purposes of calculating the lodestar, unusable. They contain troubling inconsistencies and omissions. There are numerous instances of what appear to be inaccurate and even contradictory billing entries. Moreover, the total number of hours claimed is excessive. The only conclusion that this court can reach is that the attorney\u2019s records of the time actually spent cannot be fairly relied upon.\u201d Sklar\u2019s time estimate for the time she spent over five years (from Oct. 2005 to Oct. 2009) showed her working <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"873\">*873</page-number>almost 11 hours a day, including weekends and holidays; even shared with her staff, \u201cthe numbers are hard to accept.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Although the court did not believe Sklar\u2019s proffered hours, they also included activities as a member of the class rather than as counsel and activities that should have been handled by an expert witness, a fact investigator, or a paralegal; the litigation was almost exclusively aimed at settlement, with modest monetary relief; and Caddell &amp; Chapman\u2019s slightly more than $1 million fee request was persuasive evidence that Sklar\u2019s claim was excessive. The court inferred that Sklar destroyed some or all of her original time records.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-4\">The court noted that awarding a percentage of the recovery (as Sklar initially requested) is \u201conly a cross check against the lodestar method,\u201d and as Sklar now relied on the lodestar, the court would use that measure. Sklar\u2019s time records were \u201cdisorganized, contradictory, and ultimately untrustworthy,\u201d and were not usable to calculate a lodestar.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Even without the negative inferences in CACI Nos. 203 and 204, \u201cthe Court is forced to engage in speculation and guesswork in trying to figure out her lodestar for the merits phase,\u201d and contradictory, multiple billing \u201cdestroys Ms. Sklar\u2019s credibility.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b775-5\">Although it was difficult to separate the time Sklar claimed to have spent on the merits of the class action from the time she spent litigating her fee request, \u201cit appears that she spent twice the amount of time litigating for fees as she did handling the merits.\u201d Her \u201cjumble\u201d of time records and supporting materials \u201cdeserve no weight,\u201d and she had not met her evidentiary burden to establish the hours she spent litigating the class action.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b776-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"874\">*874</page-number>Nevertheless, \u201cThe Court does accept the hours performed by Ms. Sklar\u2019s staff. They have submitted records that appear to be in order.\u201d The staff billed a total of 1,769 hours at $100 an hour. The court declined to apply a multiplier. The total fee award for SLO staff was $176,900.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-4\">2. <em>The preliminary approval/objector phase</em></p>\n<p id=\"b776-5\">The court described how after the mediation in November 2005, as the parties sought to draft a settlement agreement based on the term sheet, Sklar and Caddell &amp; Chapman disagreed regarding attorney fees. Caddell &amp; Chapman filed a motion for preliminary approval of the settlement. Sklar attempted to remove Caddell &amp; Chapman as cocounsel and objected to the settlement on grounds including one that \u201cwould have hidden the amount of her requested attorney\u2019s fees from the class by omitting it from the class notice. . . . The Court refused to approve such chicanery.\u201d The notice included the exact dollar amount of Sklar\u2019s fee request.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-6\">A detailed discussion of Sklar\u2019s objections to the preliminary settlement followed, including her arguments that she should be paid for representing class members during the settlement\u2019s dispute resolution process (the final settlement allowed her to petition for such fees); that her exact fee amount did not need to be included in the notice (as explained above, this was an unsuccessful objection); that the proposed settlement did not include a provision awarding her fees (Sklar was not a signatory to the proposed settlement, and the final settlement acknowledged that she had a right to request fees); and that Caddell &amp; Chapman should not be appointed as class counsel, including opposition to the firm\u2019s fee request (the court overruled this \u201cfrivolous\u201d objection). \u201cThe objections demonstrate that the vast majority of Ms. Sklar\u2019s efforts were not calculated to benefit the class, but to protect or inflate her fee claim,\u201d and Sklar had achieved only \u201cde minimis\u201d success. The court did not believe Sklar\u2019s claim of 1,060 hours during this part of the litigation. Further, Sklar \u201caccomplished next to nothing\u201d and put her interests before those of her client, delaying the preliminary approval of the settlement, and therefore \u201cdeserves no portion of her lodestar. The Court in its discretion declines to award SLO anything for its efforts in objecting to the settlement terms.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b776-7\">3. <em>The attorney fees application phase</em></p>\n<p id=\"b776-8\">The litigation over Sklar\u2019s fees began with her declaration filed in August 2006, seeking $24,743,965.50 in fees, and Sklar reported spending more hours on this phase of the litigation than on the other two combined. Sklar then resisted the taking of her deposition and the inspection of her time records, resulting in hearings and orders regarding discovery motions. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"875\">*875</page-number>trial court explained that Sklar\u2019s deletion of her electronic records and periodic \u201cscrubbing\u201d of the underlying metadata justified an inspection of her computers, but Sklar\u2019s \u201cfurious effort to resist this procedure\u201d led to her violation of two court orders. Sklar\u2019s final fee petition in October 2009 (the petition before the court) requested a lodestar amount of $12,079,543.69, and she also filed a motion for an order directing service of a second class notice to allow her additional costs related to the fee litigation, which the court denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-4\">The court then compared Sklar\u2019s request with Caddell &amp; Chapman\u2019s fee amount of $1,125,000 (including expenses). Although the firm did not have to engage in the discovery battle that Sklar experienced, \u201cMs Sklar brought the firestorm on herself by (1) demanding an initial sum that can be charitably described as unrealistic, (2) refusing to produce information that Toshiba was entitled to have, and (3) failing to preserve\u2014and perhaps willfully destroying\u2014underlying time records.\u201d (Fn. omitted.) The court had \u201cgreat difficulty\u201d accepting Sklar\u2019s reported hours as accurate, and declined to award a multiplier for \u201c \u2018fees on fees.\u2019 \u201d \u201c[T]he class realized no benefit at all from the fee litigation of this case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b777-5\">Sklar had also \u201crelinquished her entitlement to a fee\u201d by her unprofessional misconduct, including refusal to provide straight answers to the court\u2019s questions; refusal to cooperate in discovery; fighting legitimate efforts by Toshiba to confirm her time; making unfounded accusations against Toshiba and its counsel; and providing a \u201cmoving target that constitutes Ms. Sklar\u2019s fee request,\u201d eventually asking Toshiba to pay her $5.4 million for the fee litigation, during which period she <em>reduced </em>her initial request for her work on the merits of the class action by almost three-fourths, from $23.5 million to $6.6 million. \u201cBased on the foregoing, as well as the authority in <em>Serrano </em>v. <em>Unruh, supra, </em>32 Cal.3d 621, the Court declines to award any fees to SLO for this third phase of the litigation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b777-6\">The court awarded SLO $176,900 as \u201cthe total fees to which it is entitled in this action.\u201d Sklar\u2019s appeal in No. B227078 followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b777-8\">I. <em>We grant in part Toshiba\u2019s motion to strike and award monetary sanctions against Sklar in the amount of Toshiba\u2019s attorney fees related to the motion.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b777-10\">Sklar\u2019s challenges to the court\u2019s detailed order are many and varied. Before we address her arguments, we turn to Toshiba\u2019s motion to strike portions of Sklar\u2019s appellant\u2019s appendix and for sanctions against SLO.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"876\">*876</page-number>Toshiba\u2019s motion contends that Sklar has altered the record on appeal in an attempt to \u201c \u2018unjumble\u2019 \u201d the time records that the trial court described as unusable, inconsistent and contradictory, incomplete, and unreliable. According to Toshiba, Sklar has reorganized items, omitted items filed in the trial court, and added items not filed in the trial court, all in violation of California Rules of Court, rule 8.124(g). Toshiba discovered these discrepancies while preparing its respondent\u2019s brief.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b778-4\">A declaration by Toshiba\u2019s counsel attached to the motion explains that the discrepancies appear in exhibit No. 121 to Sklar\u2019s October 2009 fee petition. The petition states that exhibit No. 121 consists of true and correct copies of the time records for all attorneys and staff at SLO. Exhibit No. 121, as it appears in Sklar\u2019s appellant\u2019s appendix, spans more than 2,000 pages.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Toshiba found discrepancies between the exhibit No. 121 Toshiba received with service of the fee petition and the version contained in the appendix. To ensure that these discrepancies also appeared in the version of exhibit No. 121 in the trial court\u2019s file, Toshiba\u2019s counsel traveled to the trial court and reviewed the record on file. Toshiba\u2019s counsel verified that as exhibit No. 121 appeared in the court file, Sklar\u2019s time records and those of her staff were not organized by person or chronology; in Sklar\u2019s appendix, the exhibit is organized chronologically and by timekeeper. The exhibit No. 121 in the appendix deleted some overlapping time records, and added nearly 100 pages of handwritten time records which did not appear in the court file, all apparently for Sklar\u2019s assistant, Richard Goldstein. Toshiba requests that we strike the inconsistent portions of exhibit No. 121 from Sklar\u2019s appendix, and that we impose monetary or other sanctions, up to dismissal of Sklar\u2019s appeal. Counsel\u2019s declaration includes the amount of attorney fees incurred in reviewing the record in the trial court and preparing the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-5\">Sklar responds, \u201cthere is no issue with Exhibit 121,\u201d and argues that the time records were not jumbled or disorganized as presented to the trial court. She claims that her paralegal, Susan Goldstein, prepared a copied exhibit No. 121 without changing, altering or deleting anything, but \u201cinadvertently\u201d included 96 pages of handwritten time records for Richard Goldstein (Sklar states she will not cite to those records). She points out that some of the records Toshiba states were not included in exhibit No. 121 as it appears in the appendix appear elsewhere, with different captions, and two others \u201care not pertinent to the issues raised by [Sklar] on appeal.\u201d She argues that Toshiba should have submitted a certified copy of the multiple volumes of exhibit No. 121 as contained in the court file, and should have provided a listing by Bates <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"877\">*877</page-number>numbers as they appear in the court file. Toshiba\u2019s response includes, attached to a declaration by counsel, a table comparing exhibit No. 121 as it appears in the court file and as it appears in Sklar\u2019s appendix. Many parts of the exhibit do not have Bates numbers.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-4\">California Rules of Court, rule 8.124(g) is entitled \u201cInaccurate or noncomplying appendix,\u201d and states: \u201cFiling an appendix constitutes a representation that the appendix consists of accurate copies of documents in the superior court file. The reviewing court may impose monetary or other sanctions for filing an appendix that contains inaccurate copies or otherwise violates this rule.\u201d (Boldface omitted.) For all its bluster \u00e1nd obfuscation, Sklar\u2019s response acknowledges that there are differences between exhibit No. 121 as it appears in the court file and the version before us. It is Sklar\u2019s responsibility to provide an accurate appellant\u2019s appendix, and she has failed to do so <em>at least </em>to the extent identified in Toshiba\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-5\">We therefore strike the 96 pages of Richard Goldstein\u2019s handwritten records, as they were not included in the court file. <em>(The Termo Co. v. Luther </em>(2008) 169 Cad.App.4th 394, 404 [86 Cal.Rptr.3d 687].) The other inconsistencies in the appearance of exhibit No. 121 (reorganization and deletion of overlapping records), while extremely troubling, do not require that we strike the over 2,000 pages of the appellant\u2019s appendix. In resolving this appeal, as explained below, we conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying Sklar\u2019s fee request. We reach that conclusion after reviewing exhibit No. 121 and agreeing with the trial court that it is a disorganized jumble, even as it appears in the record on appeal, so that any reorganization attempted by Sklar was fruitless. We conclude that Toshiba is entitled to monetary sanctions on appeal in the amount of its attorney fees related to the motion to strike and Toshiba\u2019s reply in support of the motion, as determined by the trial court on remand. (See <em>Keitel v. Heubel </em>(2002) 103 Cal.App.4th 324, 342 [126 Cal.Rptr.2d 763] [courts may consider the amount of attorney fees on appeal in determining monetary sanctions].)</p>\n<p id=\"b779-6\">II. <em>The trial court acted within its discretion in awarding sanctions.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b779-7\">\u201cThe court may impose a monetary sanction ordering that one engaging in the misuse of the discovery process, or any attorney advising that conduct, or both pay the reasonable expenses, including attorney\u2019s fees, incurred by anyone as a result of that conduct. ...

(a).) Misuse of the discovery process includes disobeying a court order to provide discovery and failing to meet and confer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"878\">*878</page-number>in good faith to resolve a discovery dispute when required by statute to do so. <em>(In re Marriage of Michaely </em>(2007) 150 Cal.App.4th 802, 809 [59 Cal.Rptr.3d 56]; \u00a7 2023.010, subds.

Pacific Healthcare Consultants </em>(2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 401 [55 Cal.Rptr.3d 751].) Sklar has the burden to demonstrate that the trial court erred, and where the evidence is in conflict we will not disturb the trial court\u2019s factual findings. <em>(Ibid.) </em>Sklar\u2019s intent is not relevant to the propriety of the monetary sanctions. \u201c \u2018There is no requirement that misuse of the discovery process must be willful for a monetary sanction to be imposed.\u2019 [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Clement </em>v. <em>Alegre </em>(2009) 177 Cal.App.4th 1277, 1286 [99 Cal.Rptr.3d 791].) \u201c \u2018Whenever one party\u2019s improper actions\u2014even if not \u201cwillful\u201d\u2014in seeking or resisting discovery necessitate the court\u2019s intervention in a dispute, the losing party presumptively should pay a sanction to the prevailing party\u2019 . . . .\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 1286-1287.)</p>\n<p id=\"b780-5\">Sklar\u2019s conduct, as detailed above, amply supports the sanctions award. There is no question that she disobeyed the court\u2019s August 15, 2007 order that she allow Toshiba\u2019s expert to search her hard drive, and its further order on June 24, 2008, setting the inspection for July 22 and 23, 2008. On the day before the court-ordered inspection was to begin, Sklar indicated she would not allow it to proceed. While the record is rife with evidence supporting a conclusion that Sklar\u2019s disobedience and her misuse of the discovery process were willful, her intent is irrelevant to our conclusion that she defied the court\u2019s order and \u201c \u2018presumptively should pay a sanction to the prevailing party.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Clement v. Alegre, supra, 177 </em>Cal.App.4th at pp. 1286-1287.)</p>\n<p id=\"b780-6\">Sklar admits that she refused to allow the ordered inspection to occur, but argues that her refusal was substantially justified as her hard drive contained privileged material. The trial court, however, entered a stipulated protective order providing that the production of any electronic information did not waive any of the producing party\u2019s claims of privacy, confidentiality, or privilege, and the court made it clear that no privileges were waived. Sklar also argues that the court had no authority under section 2023.030 to order a forensic inspection. The court did not order the inspection as a sanction under section 2023.030. Sklar next argues that she learned only two days before the inspection in July 2008 that Toshiba\u2019s expert would image her hard drive. This ignores that Sklar\u2019s initial protocol, attached to an e-mail from her counsel on October 19, 2007, began with the creation of a forensic image of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"879\">*879</page-number>Sklar\u2019s hard drive (albeit performed by SLO and subject to examination at Sklar\u2019s home office).<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> The protocol also provided for the presence of Toshiba\u2019s counsel at the inspection of the imaged hard drive by Toshiba\u2019s expert, as well as Sklar, SLO\u2019s counsel, and an SLO expert.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Sklar\u2019s protocol provided that the imaged hard drive would be an exact duplicate of her hard drive, so the image would be the same regardless of which party took the image. None of Sklar\u2019s arguments constitutes substantial justification for her disobedience of the court order that Sklar allow Toshiba\u2019s expert to inspect her hard drive.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-4\">As the trial court said with some exasperation at the April 24, 2009 hearing on Toshiba\u2019s motion for sanctions, after Sklar argued that the lack of an ordered protocol substantially justified her disobedience of the court order requiring inspection, \u201cthe record in this case is one of obfuscation and delay by [Sklar].\u201d We agree. The record as we have described it above shows that Sklar did not cooperate in creating a protocol, and \u201cstrongly indicates that the purpose [of Sklar\u2019s behavior] was ... to generally obstruct the self-executing process of discovery.\u201d <em>(Clement </em>v. <em>Alegre, supra, </em>177 Cal.App.4th at p. 1292.) That she disputed details of the protocol (while failing to negotiate with Toshiba) does not provide substantial justification for her open defiance of a court order requiring inspection. \u201cThe trial court could look at the whole picture of the discovery dispute and was well within its discretion in rejecting [Sklar\u2019s] claim of substantial justification.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>We conclude the court acted within its considerable discretion in imposing sanctions based on Sklar\u2019s \u201c[m]isuse[] of the discovery process.\u201d (\u00a7 2023.010.)</p>\n<p id=\"b781-5\">This brings us to the second basis for the sanctions. While Sklar\u2019s refusal to obey the court\u2019s order to allow inspection by Toshiba\u2019s expert is sufficient to support the sanctions award, we also conclude that the court did not abuse its discretion when it based its sanctions order in part on Sklar\u2019s failure to meet and confer with Toshiba regarding both of the court-ordered inspections. Section 2023.020 requires the court to \u201cimpose a monetary sanction ordering that any party or attorney who fails to confer as required pay the reasonable expenses, including attorney\u2019s fees, incurred by anyone as a result of that conduct.\u201d Although the discovery statutes expressly require that a party \u201cmeet and confer\u201d before filing certain discovery motions (\u00a7\u00a7 2030.300, subd. (b), 2031.310, subd. (b)(2)), there is no statutory requirement at issue in this case. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"880\">*880</page-number>Instead, the trial court repeatedly directed the parties to cooperate in creating an acceptable protocol for the inspection of Sklar\u2019s electronic records. The record shows that while Toshiba repeatedly attempted to discuss a protocol for the inspections, Sklar did not reciprocate in a constructive fashion. This failure to engage in cooperative discussion regarding a protocol resulted in the lack of any agreed-upon procedure for the July 2008 inspection by Toshiba\u2019s expert. \u201c \u2018[A] reasonable and good faith attempt at informal resolution entails something more than bickering with [opposing] counsel .... Rather, the law requires that counsel attempt to talk the matter over, compare their views, consult, and deliberate\u2019 [citation].\u201d <em>(Clement v. Alegre, supra, </em>177 Cal.App.4th at p. 1294.) Sklar cannot rely on the absence of a detailed protocol\u2014an absence to which she contributed by failing to meet and confer with Toshiba\u2014as substantial justification for disobeying the court order to allow the inspection.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-4\">\u201cA court\u2019s decision to impose a particular sanction is \u2018subject to reversal only for manifest abuse exceeding the bounds of reason.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Electronic Funds Solutions, LLC v. Murphy, supra, </em>134 Cal.App.4th at p. 1183.) The trial court\u2019s decision to sanction Sklar in the amount of $165,000 was not outside the bounds of reason.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b782-5\">III. <em>The trial court did not act in excess of its jurisdiction in making the inspection orders.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b782-6\">Sklar also argues that the trial court abused its discretion in entering the inspection orders of August 15, 2007, and June 24, 2008, so that the award of sanctions for disobedience was also an abuse of discretion. Even if the court\u2019s orders were an abuse of discretion that does not excuse Sklar\u2019s disobedience of the orders. \u201cIn contrast to orders entered \u2018 \u201cin excess of the jurisdiction of the issuing court\u201d \u2019 [citation], which may be challenged collaterally, a party may not defend against enforcement of a court order by contending merely that the order is legally erroneous [citations].\u201d <em>(Wanke, Industrial, Commercial, Residential, Inc. v. Keck </em>(2012) 209 Cal.App.4th 1151, 1172-1173 [147 Cal.Rptr.3d 651] <em>(Wanke); </em>see <em>In re Marriage of Niklas, supra, </em>211 Cal.App.3d at p. 35.) Sklar was bound to obey the order to allow the inspection of her hard drive \u201c \u2018 \u201chowever erroneous the action of the court may be,\u201d \u2019 \u201d as \u201c \u2018[a]n erroneous order ... is not necessarily an order in excess of the issuing court\u2019s jurisdiction, as an order that is unconstitutional on its face would be.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Wanke, </em>at pp. 1172-1173, italics omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b782-7\">Sklar also argues that the court had no statutory authority to make the order as she was a \u201cnon-party attorney\u201d (despite her express acknowledgment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"881\">*881</page-number>in 2008 that Judge Mohr had already issued some discovery orders and had jurisdiction over all disputes),<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> and that the court similarly lacked authority as the order would have forced her to disclose privileged information (despite the stipulated protective order). These arguments do not challenge the court\u2019s jurisdiction but restate Sklar\u2019s contention that the court erred, and even if her arguments had some validity, \u201cdemonstrating that the trial court <em>erred </em>in issuing the [order] would not be sufficient to demonstrate that the court acted in \u2018excess of its jurisdiction\u2019 in doing so. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Wanke, supra, </em>209 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1178-1179.)</p>\n<p id=\"b783-4\">Further, the sizeable nature of Sklar\u2019s fee request and her resistance to the court\u2019s inquiries regarding her seemingly excessive rates made the court\u2019s inspection orders reasonable and necessary. Sklar requested over $24 million in attorney fees. In support, she provided hardcopies of her billing records purporting to show that she worked at a superhuman rate, followed by a CD with PDF copies of those time records (which she acknowledges had been redacted). Sklar later represented that she had deleted all the original electronic billing records that arguably might have cast doubt on the accuracy of her billing. We therefore reject Sklar\u2019s complaint that the court exceeded its jurisdiction when it authorized Toshiba\u2019s inspection of her hard drive to determine whether any of that electronically stored information survived her destruction of the files.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-5\">IV. <em>The trial court acted within its discretion in denying Sklar attorney fees.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b783-6\">\u201cExcept as provided for by statute, compensation for attorney fees is left to the agreement of the parties. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1021.) Civil Code section 1717 .. . provides that reasonable attorney fees authorized by contract shall be awarded to the prevailing party as \u2018fixed by the court.\u2019 The trial court has broad discretion to determine the amount of a reasonable fee, and the award of such fees is governed by equitable principles. [Citation.] The first step involves the lodestar figure\u2014a calculation based on the number of hours reasonably expended multiplied by the lawyer\u2019s hourly rate. \u2018The lodestar figure may then be adjusted, based on consideration of factors specific to the case, in order to fix the fee at the fair market value for the legal services provided.\u2019 [Citation.] In short, after determining the lodestar amount, the court shall then \u2018 \u201cconsider whether the total award so calculated under all of the circumstances of the case is more than a reasonable amount and, if so, shall reduce the [Civil Code] section 1717 award so that it is a reasonable figure.\u201d \u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(EnPalm, LLC v.

Although Sklar variously characterizes her fee request as under the Consumers Legal Remedies Act, Civil Code section 1780, and the private attorney general statute, Code of Civil Procedure section 1021.5, as well as a contingency fee, her entitlement to fees is contractual, grounded in the settlement agreement\u2019s provision that Toshiba will pay reasonable attorney fees and costs to class counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-4\">\u201c \u2018 \u201cThe standard of review on issues of attorney\u2019s fees and costs is abuse of discretion.

The number of hours claimed were excessive (over five years, about 11 hours a day every day for Sklar and SLO), and Sklar\u2019s hours included activities that should have been handled by an expert witness, fact investigator, or paralegal.

Toshiba objected to Sklar\u2019s fee request, putting her records in issue. The trial court resolved the conflict in the evidence in favor of Toshiba, concluding that Sklar had not met her burden to produce accurate time records. Rather than ignoring the lodestar method, the court found that it had insufficient credible evidence of Sklar\u2019s time <em>even to apply </em>the lodestar method, which begins with the number of hours counsel reasonably expended on the litigation. <em>(EnPalm, supra, </em>162 Cal.App.4th at p. 774.)<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> While Sklar vigorously disputes the trial court\u2019s conclusion, \u201cwe do not reweigh the evidence\u201d in considering whether the trial court abused its discretion. <em>(Weber v. Langholz </em>(1995) 39 Cal.App.4th 1578, 1587 [46 Cal.Rptr.2d 677].)</p>\n<p id=\"b785-5\">We also emphasize that the court found that the contradictory and multiple billing \u201cdestroys Ms. Sklar\u2019s credibility\u201d as to the hours she claimed to have spent during the entire litigation: the merits phase preceding the settlement, the phase during which the parties sought preliminary approval, and. the fees phase. The court concluded that it could not trust Sklar\u2019s time records during any of those periods. Further, Sklar had \u201cconcealed and destroyed evidence\u201d of the time she actually spent on the case, leading the court to believe that the \u25a0missing records would show a lesser amount of time. The trial court stated that Sklar had not been truthful about the amount of fees (approximately $24 million) she initially requested; engaged in \u201cdissembling and outright distortions\u201d; and concealed and destroyed evidence, so that the court was left with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"884\">*884</page-number>\u201clingering skepticism over the veracity of her testimony and her evidence.\u201d This constitutes a clear adverse credibility determination. The trial court decided against Sklar because it did not believe her evidence of time spent in the class action litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-4\">Such a credibility determination is uniquely the province of the trial court. Just as we may not reweigh the evidence, we do not reassess credibility determinations, as \u201c \u2018[t]he Court of Appeal is not a second trier of fact. . . .\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(In re Marriage of Balcof </em>(2006) 141 Cal.App.4th 1509, 1531 [47 Cal.Rptr.3d 183]; see <em>Estate of Young </em>(2008) 160 Cal.App.4th 62, 76 [72 Cal.Rptr.3d 520].)</p>\n<p id=\"b786-5\">B. <em>The trial court cited other reasons for denying the fee award.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b786-6\">The trial court also compared Sklar\u2019s initial request of over $24.74 million to the less than half that amount ($12,079,534.69) she requested in the April 2010 fee petition, and stated; \u201c[A] court would be justified in denying outright SLO\u2019s fee request for this reason alone.\u201d In <em>Serrano v. Unruh, supra, </em>32 Cal.3d at page 635, the California Supreme Court stated; \u201cA fee request that appears unreasonably inflated is a special circumstance permitting the trial court to reduce the award or deny one altogether. \u2018If . . . the Court were required to award a reasonable fee when an outrageously unreasonable one has been asked for, claimants would be encouraged to make unreasonable demands, knowing that the only unfavorable consequence of such misconduct would be reduction of their fee to what they should have asked in the first place. To discourage such greed, a severer reaction is needful. . . .\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d (Fn. omitted.) (See <em>Chavez </em>v. <em>City of Los Angeles </em>(2010) 47 Cal.4th 970, 990 [104 Cal.Rptr.3d 710, 224 P.3d 41].)</p>\n<p id=\"b786-7\">Sklar\u2019s initial fee request for more than $24.74 million was calculated based on a percentage of an expert\u2019s declaration estimating the value of the settlement. By the time she made her final fee request, Sklar had withdrawn the declaration, and her final request was based on the lodestar method. As the trial court recognized, a percentage of the recovery analysis may be used to \u201ccross check\u201d a lodestar amount, but it does not substitute for determining a lodestar. \u201c \u2018 \u201cUnder certain circumstances, a lodestar calculation may be enhanced on the basis of a percentage-of-the-benefit analysis. [Citation.]\u201d [Citation.]\u2019 [Citation.] This approach \u2018anchors the trial court\u2019s analysis to an objective determination of the value of the attorney\u2019s services, ensuring that the amount awarded is not arbitrary.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Consumer Privacy Cases </em>(2009) 175 Cal.App.4th 545, 556-557 [96 Cal.Rptr.3d 127].) When she withdrew her expert\u2019s declaration, the basis for Sklar\u2019s outsize initial request disappeared. As that initial request was based on a percentage of the recovery, we decline to compare it directly to the lodestar amount that Sklar eventually claimed.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"885\">*885</page-number>While we agree with the trial court that Sklar\u2019s requested fee amount was a moving target, casting doubt on her entitlement to fees, the trial court cited Sklar\u2019s inflated fee request as only one of several reasons for denying a fee award. We therefore need not consider whether this alternate ground for denying fees to Sklar would alone support the trial court\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-4\">The trial court also found that Sklar made numerous unfounded accusations of unethical behavior against other participants in the litigation, including Caddell &amp; Chapman and Toshiba\u2019s counsel, among others, and cited to the record in support. We need not rely on this ground, but we note that Sklar continues this conduct on this appeal.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b787-5\">C. <em>Sklar\u2019s other contentions are without merit.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b787-6\">Sklar protests the court\u2019s refusal to apply a multiplier to her fee request for the litigation over attorney fees (\u201cfees on fees\u201d), but the court concluded that the litigation over her fee request provided no benefit to the class and that no multiplier was required. This was not an abuse of discretion <em>(Pellegrino </em>v. <em>Robert Half Intemat., Inc., supra, </em>182 Cal.App.4th at p. 295), and, at any rate, as the court concluded that there was not credible evidence supporting a lodestar amount, it is irrelevant whether a multiplier was appropriate. The same applies to Sklar\u2019s argument that the court improperly reduced her hourly billing rate; because no fees were awarded, the rate reduction is not in issue. Sklar contends that the trial court abused its discretion in considering the declaration of Toshiba\u2019s expert, Professor William Rubenstein, citing to materials regarding his participation in other cases. We denied Sklar\u2019s motion to take judicial notice of those materials and therefore do not address this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-7\">Sklar also argues that the trial court abused its discretion in applying CACI Nos. 203 and 204 because there was no evidence that she willfully suppressed evidence. To the contrary, as described above, the record shows that Sklar repeatedly resisted discovery of her original time records, and we will not disturb the trial court\u2019s compliance with Evidence Code section 412, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"886\">*886</page-number>which states: \u201cIf weaker and less satisfactory evidence is offered when it was within the power of the party to produce stronger and more satisfactory evidence, the evidence offered should be viewed with distrust.\u201d \u201cIf stronger evidence is clearly available, the trial court may draw the inference offered by . . . section 412, and view the proffered evidence with distrust.\u201d <em>(Houghtaling </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1993) 17 Cal.App.4th 1128, 1137 [21 Cal.Rptr.2d 855].)</p>\n<p id=\"b788-4\">Sklar contends that the court abused its discretion in excluding the two boxes of handwritten time records that she produced during the two days of her deposition in June 2009. As we explained above, Toshiba argued that it had sought those records since 2006, and after a hearing the court ordered Sklar to bring the originals to her resumed deposition in September 2009, warning that if she did not proceed with the deposition she would be barred from using those documents in support of her fee petition. Sklar did not appear for her deposition and did not produce the original documents. The court did not abuse its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-5\">Sklar argues that the trial court\u2019s denial of fees is a constructive sanction, motivated by \u201csubjective reasons\u201d including antipathy toward Sklar and a desire to punish, and the fee order is not based on the evidence. To the contrary, the fee order as described above shows the trial court\u2019s careful consideration of the evidence; it was not required to conclude that Sklar\u2019s evidence was reliable.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-6\">Sklar also challenges the trial court\u2019s order that Sklar\u2019s communication with the class go through the claims administrator. She does not support that claim with any reasoned argument, and we therefore do not address it. \u201cWe are not bound to develop appellants\u2019 arguments for them. [Citation.] The absence of cogent legal argument or citation to authority allows this court to treat the contentions as waived. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(In re Marriage of Falcone &amp; Fyke </em>(2008) 164 Cal.App.4th 814, 830 [79 Cal.Rptr.3d 588].)</p>\n<p id=\"b788-7\">Sklar argues that the trial court abused its discretion in failing to rule on her evidentiary objections. At the hearing on the fee petition, the trial court commented that Sklar\u2019s objections were \u201cso prolix that I can\u2019t promise you I\u2019m going to be able to get through them,\u201d and directed Sklar to identify the most important objections and schedule a hearing. The trial court was within its discretion to order Sklar to focus on those objections that were important to her case. <em>(Reid v. Google, Inc. </em>(2010) 50 Cal.4th 512, 532-533 [113 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"887\">*887</page-number>Cal.Rptr.3d 327, 235 P.3d 988].) Sklar never pruned her objections or requested a hearing, instead electing not to file any more evidence and requesting that the matter be submitted. She therefore waived her evidentiary objections.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-4\">V. <em>The court did not rule on Sklar\u2019s request for costs.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b789-5\">The settlement agreement provided: \u201cThe maximum amount of fees and expenses to be sought by Sklar Law Offices shall be set forth in the Class Notice.\u201d<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> The class notice stated, \u201cSklar Law Offices will ask for litigation expenses in the amount of $114,900.\u201d Sklar\u2019s January 2008 fee petition requested costs of $410,383.53, and her October 2009 fee petition sought costs of $905,572. The trial court ruled against Sklar\u2019s November 2009 motion for a second class notice to set forth the increased expense request.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-6\">At the February 10, 2010 hearing, the court stated: \u201cI am very hard put to figure out how you could be awarded any more costs based on the agreement that limits you.\u201d At the hearing on April 5, 2012, the court referred to the settlement and the class notice as limiting Sklar\u2019s expense amount. The court\u2019s order denying fees states: \u201cMs. Sklar also filed a motion for an order directing service of a second class notice by email. She did so in order to recover additional costs that she claims to have incurred because of the intensity of the litigation surrounding her attorney\u2019s fee application. The Court denied the motion because Ms. Sklar\u2019s costs were limited by the settlement agreement, a contract she expressly agreed to.\u201d The trial court did not, however, address whether Sklar was entitled to recover all or any part of the $114,900 as set forth in the class notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-7\">Toshiba argues on appeal that the \u201cdisarray\u201d of Sklar\u2019s documentation in support of her costs justified denying her request for costs, and the majority of Sklar\u2019s claimed costs were not recoverable. While the court denied her request to send a new class notice with the increased cost amount (therefore limiting her costs to the $114,900 appearing in the initial class notice), it did not rule on her cost request. The state of the supporting record, and whether that record supports an award of costs in any amount, is for the trial court to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"888\">*888</page-number>determine in the first instance. We therefore remand to the trial court to rule on Sklar\u2019s request for costs, in light of the settlement agreement, the class notice, and her subsequent fee petitions.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-4\">VI. <em>The trial court acted within its discretion in awarding $176,900 in fees for work by SLO staff.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b790-5\">The trial court\u2019s June 20, 2010 order states: \u201cThe court can calculate a lodestar for SLO\u2019s staff because their time records appear to be in order. Susan Goldstein devoted 1,385 hours to the merits phase at a stated hourly rate of $100. Richard Goldstein devoted 354 hours to the merits phase at a stated hourly rate of $100.[<footnotemark>25</footnotemark>] Missy Mouser devoted 30 hours to the merits phase at a stated hourly rate of $100. The SLO staff claims to have billed 1,769 hours at $100 per hour for a total lodestar of $176,900. Declining to apply a multiplier to the services of SLO\u2019s staff produces a total fee for SLO\u2019s work during the merits phase [in] the sum of $176,900.\u201d Toshiba cross-appeals, arguing that no fees should have been awarded for the work of the SLO staff.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-6\">\u2022 First, Toshiba points out that 24 hours of Missy Mouser\u2019s time was incurred in May 2006, so that she devoted only six hours to the merits phase (Oct. 2004 to Apr. 2006) rather than 30, as the order states. This is a simple calculation error which the court can correct on remand by subtracting $2,400 from the fee award.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-7\">Second, Toshiba argues that SLO\u2019s staff are not qualified paralegals under California law, and therefore the trial court erred in awarding fees for their work. As in the trial court, Toshiba opposes the award of fees on the ground that Sklar\u2019s staff were not paralegals pursuant to Business and Professions Code section 6450. Sklar replies (as she did in the trial court) that her staff were paralegals under Minnesota requirements, complied with California\u2019s continuing education requirements, and their billing rate of $100 was less than one-half of the rate at which Toshiba\u2019s counsel billed its paralegal time.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-8\">Business and Professions Code section 6450, subdivision (c), sets forth the required qualifications for paralegals under California law.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> Toshiba points <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"889\">*889</page-number>out that none of Sklar\u2019s staff possessed a certificate of completion from a paralegal program; neither Susan nor Richard Goldstein had a baccalaureate degree; none obtained three years of law-related supervised work before December 31, 2003; and Sklar did not provide a written declaration that any was qualified to perform paralegal tasks. As authority for the proposition that no fees may be awarded for paralegal work unless the paralegal meets the requirements of the California statute, Toshiba cites two unpublished decisions from federal district courts in California.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> These cases do not bind us, and in any event they do not hold, and we have found no California state cases holding, that compliance with the educational requirements of Business and Professions Code section 6540 is in every case a prerequisite to the recovery of paralegal fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-4\">In the face of Toshiba\u2019s argument that Sklar\u2019s Minnesota staff deserved no compensation on the basis of noncompliance with California\u2019s educational requirements for \u201cparalegals,\u201d the court nevertheless awarded fees for the work of Sklar\u2019s \u201cstaff.\u201d Nowhere in the trial court\u2019s order awarding fees does the court state that Sklar\u2019s staff were paralegals, or that the $176,900 awarded was for the work of paralegals. \u201cThe trial court is in the best position to determine the reasonable value of professional services rendered in a case before it and has broad discretion to determine the reasonable amount of an attorney fee award.\u201d <em>(Collins </em>v. <em>City of Los Angeles </em>(2012) 205 Cal.App.4th 140, 159 [139 Cal.Rptr.3d 880].) Further, on appeal we presume the trial court\u2019s order is correct, indulge all presumptions in favor of that correctness, and resolve all ambiguities in favor of affirmance. <em>(Hirshfield v. Schwartz, supra, </em>91 Cal.App.4th at pp. 765-766.) In this case, the trial court concluded <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"890\">*890</page-number>that reimbursement at a rate of $100 an hour was appropriate for Sklar\u2019s staff <em>without </em>either stating that they were paralegals or stating that $100 an hour was a paralegal rate. We presume (in favor of the order\u2019s correctness) that the trial court did not consider the staff to be \u201cparalegals\u201d and did not consider $100 an hour to be a paralegal rate. We cannot say it was an abuse of discretion to award fees for the work of SLO\u2019s staff.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-4\">Third, Toshiba argues that the records for SLO staff time suffered from the same defects as Sklar\u2019s time records. The trial court, however, while it concluded that it could not calculate a lodestar from Sklar\u2019s time records, found that the staff\u2019s records were \u201cin order.\u201d<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> Just as it was not an abuse of discretion for the trial court to conclude that Sklar\u2019s time records were so hopelessly duplicative, contradictory, and unreliable that it could not calculate' a lodestar, it was not an abuse of discretion for the court to conclude that the records of staff time were sufficiently coherent to serve as a basis for calculating a fee award for staff time.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-5\">Sklar\u2019s reply brief argues that the court should have awarded fees for \u201cparalegal services\u201d for the entire litigation and erred in calculating Susan Goldstein\u2019s hourly rate. Those arguments are meritless in light of our conclusion above that the award was not for \u201cparalegal services.\u201d Further, the court concluded that no fees were appropriate for the latter stages of the litigation, because the class received no benefit from Sklar\u2019s objections to the settlement or from the attorney fees litigation. The appellate record amply demonstrates that the court\u2019s conclusion was within its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-6\">DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b792-7\">The order awarding monetary sanctions is affirmed. The portion of the attorney fee order awarding $176,900 in fees for work by Sklar Law Offices staff is reversed, and is remanded to the trial court for correction of the amount of fees due for the work of Missy Mouser, and for a determination by the trial court of the amount, if any, of costs to be awarded to Sklar Law Offices, with a maximum cost award of $114,900. The trial court is also directed to award monetary sanctions to Toshiba America Information Systems in the amount of its attorney fees and costs related to Toshiba America <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"891\">*891</page-number>Information Systems\u2019s motion to strike. In all other respects, the attorney fee award is affirmed. Costs on appeal are to be awarded to Toshiba America Information Systems. Pursuant to Business and Professions Code section 6086.7, subdivision (a)(3), the clerk of this court is directed to send a certified copy of this opinion to the State Bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-4\">Rothschild, Acting P.
