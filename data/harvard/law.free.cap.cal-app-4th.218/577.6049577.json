Code, \u00a7 6250 et seq.) provides for the inspection of public records maintained by state and local agencies. The Pacific Merchant Shipping Association (PMSA), real party in interest in this case, petitioned the trial court for a writ of mandate compelling production under the CPRA of certain records held by Captain Bruce Horton, the then designated port agent of the Board of Pilot Commissioners for the Bays of San Francisco, San Pablo and Suisun (hereafter Port Agent and Board, respectively). The trial court granted the petition. Horton, who also served as president of petitioner San Francisco Bar Pilots (Bar Pilots), seeks a writ of mandate and/or prohibition in this court directing the trial court to set aside its order. The Board separately challenges the trial court order. The Board, Horton,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and Bar Pilots all argue that the Port Agent is not a state officer subject to the CPRA and that the records sought are private, not public.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-8\">We stayed the trial court\u2019s order and requested briefing. After consideration of the petitions, the opposition of PMSA, and the petitioners\u2019 replies, we ordered consolidation of the petitions and issued an order to the trial court to show cause why the relief requested should not be granted.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We now grant that relief, finding that, while the Port Agent is, for at least certain purposes, a public officer, PMSA has not established that the requested records are subject to the CPRA.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>I. Background and Procedural History</p>\n<p id=\"b484-4\">One of the first acts of the California Legislature in 1850 was to establish the Board. (Harb. &amp; Nav. Code, \u00a7 1101, subd. (g).) The Board licenses and regulates pilots<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> on San Francisco Bay and its tributaries. (Harb. &amp; Nav. Code, \u00a7 1100 et. seq.)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The Board presently consists of seven members, appointed by the Governor with the consent of the Senate, with two members required to be licensed pilots, two members representing the shipping industry, and three public members.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> (Harb. &amp; Nav. Code, \u00a7 1150.)</p>\n<p id=\"b484-5\">Bar Pilots is a private unincorporated association of pilots licensed by the Board. Piloting services are compulsory and monopolistic.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Subject to limited exceptions, pilots licensed by the Board have \u201cexclusive authority ... to pilot vessels from the high seas to Monterey Bay and the Bays of San Francisco, San Pablo, and Suisun and the ports thereof, and from those bays and ports to the high seas,\u201d as well as \u201cexclusive authority to pilot vessels within and along the waters of those bays . . . .\u201d (Harb. &amp; Nav. Code, \u00a7 1125, subd. (a); see \u00a7\u00a7 1132-1133.) Fees for most, but not all, pilotage services are set by statute. (See Harb. &amp; Nav. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 1190-1191.) Pilots are required to provide pilotage to vessels requiring a pilot (such as large container, cargo, military, and passenger cmise ships) and are subject to a fine and suspension or revocation of their license if they fail to do so. (Harb. &amp; Nav. Code, \u00a7 1138.)</p>\n<p id=\"b484-6\">PMSA is a private maritime trade association composed of companies that own or operate ocean-going vessels in California waters. Its members pay fees for private pilot services rendered by members of the Bar Pilots. PMSA nominates the shipping industry representatives to the Board. (Harb. &amp; Nav. Code, \u00a7 1150, subd. (a)(2).)</p>\n<p id=\"b485-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>The Port Agent is a licensed pilot appointed by a majority of all licensed pilots, subject to confirmation by the Board. (Harb. &amp; Nav. Code, \u00a7 1130; Cal. Code Regs., tit. 7, \u00a7 218, subd. (a).)<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The Port Agent\u2019s duties are \u201cto carry out the orders of the Board, under applicable laws, and to otherwise administer the affairs of the pilots\u201d (Regs., \u00a7 218, subd. (a)), including general responsibility for the \u201csupervision and management of all matters related to the business and official duties of pilots\u201d (Harb. &amp; Nav. Code, \u00a7 1130, subd. (b); Regs., \u00a7 218, subd. (b)) and the specific responsibility of assigning pilots to vessels (Regs., \u00a7 218, subd. (d)(1)). The Port Agent does not serve as a member or officer of the Board and receives no compensation from the Board (see Regs., \u00a7\u00a7 206, 207); he does, however, have certain reporting obligations to the Board, including:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-4\">\u2014Immediate notification of the Board\u2019s executive director of a suspected violation, navigational incident, misconduct, or other rules violation to which the Port Agent is a witness or receives a report. (Harb. &amp; Nav. Code, \u00a7 1130, subd. (c).)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-5\">\u2014Collection of data, preparation of accounts and making of payments to the Board required of pilots by statute and regulation, including the name, class, high gross tonnage and deep draft of each vessel subject to pilotage. (Regs., \u00a7 218, subd. (d)(4).)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-6\">\u2014Reports of all accidents, groundings, collisions or similar navigational incidents involving a vessel to which a pilot has been assigned, as well as suspected pilot misconduct, including all pertinent details of the incident as set forth in the regulation. (Regs., \u00a7 218, subd. (d)(6).)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-7\">\u2014Reports of any matter that in the Port Agent\u2019s opinion affects the ability of a pilot to carry out his or her lawful duties. (Regs., \u00a7 218, subd. (d)(8).)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-8\">\u2014Reports whenever any pilot is absent from duty because of illness lasting longer than seven days, including the nature of the illness, the probable duration of absence and the anticipated date of return to duty. (Regs., \u00a7 218, subd. (f).)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b485-9\">Beginning in July 2011, PMSA requested records regarding the Port Agent\u2019s assignment of pilots to ships transiting the San Francisco Bay. PMSA made document production requests to the Port Agent and to the Board in 2011 (July 15; Aug. 30) and 2012 (Jan. 4; Mar. 26). At issue here are the latter two requests, which sought disclosure of what PMSA identifies as \u201cPilot Logs.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b486-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>The January 4, 2012 request, from PMSA\u2019s counsel and directed to \u201cCapt. Bruce Horton, Port Agent,\u201d made a CPRA request for \u201cany and all documents written, utilized or kept current by the Port Agent, including those in electronic format, related to the following: [][] The annual Pilot Log, which is a document created under the direction of the Port Agent as a memorialization of all pilot assignments to vessels made pursuant to the Port Agent\u2019s duties under [Regulations section] 218[, subdivision] (c)(1) [(current subd. (d)(1))] and reflects the administration of pilot vacation schedules pursuant to the Port Agent\u2019s duties under [Regulations section] 218[, subdivision] (c)(2) [(current subd. (d)(2))].\u201d PMSA alleged that \u201c[t]he annual Pilot Log is completed annually for each pilot in the normal course of affairs to effectuate the Board\u2019s requirement that all time be presented to the public pursuant to [Regulations section 237 [, subdivision] (d) and, under certain circumstances, [Regulations section] 237[, subdivision] (f)(1).\u201d Specifically requested were Pilot Logs for the years 2002 through 2011 for each pilot licensed during the years in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-4\">On February 22, 2012, Horton replied that \u201c[t]here is no document maintained by the Port Agent named the \u2018Pilot Log.\u2019 There is a data set that bears headings that are similar to those set forth in your e-mail to [Board counsel] of January 30, 2012. This data, however, is not used by the Port Agent in assigning pilots to vessels or in preparing or administering the pilots\u2019 vacation schedule, nor are they supplied to [the Board] in discharge of any obligation to the Board under the provisions of [Regulations] section 237[.] [][] The documents containing this data are documents that are maintained by [Bar Pilots] in its capacity as a private organization and not in connection with any duties imposed upon the Port Agent by statute or by the regulations of [the Board]. For that reason, they are not disclosable under the [CPRA].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b486-5\">The March 26, 2012 request was directed to the Board and again sought production of the 2002 through 2011 Pilot Logs. Demand was made for \u201call responsive documents in the [Board\u2019s] possession, custody and control, including but not limited to those which are in the possession of your Port Agent.\u201d The request further defined a Pilot Log as \u201ca multi-page document created at the direction of the Port Agent in the normal course of his business under [Harbors and Navigation Code section] 1130 and to keep track of a Pilot\u2019s time. This document is described in proceedings before the United States Tax Court<footnotemark>[8]</footnotemark> as an annual \u2018Pilot Log,\u2019 which is a document created for each year as a memorialization of all pilot assignments to vessels made pursuant to the Port Agent\u2019s duties as further described at [Regulations section] 218[, subdivision] (c)(1) [(current subd. (d)(1))] and reflects the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>administration of pilot vacation schedules pursuant to the Port Agent\u2019s duties under [Regulations section] 218[, subdivision] (c)(2) [(current subd. (d)(2))]. The Pilot Log is completed annually for each pilot in the normal course of affairs to effectuate the Board\u2019s requirement that all time be presented to the public pursuant to [Regulations section] 237 [, subdivision] (d) and, under certain circumstances, [Regulations section] 237[, subdivision] (f)(1).\u201d PMSA further asserted that a Pilot Log \u201cis created in part to comply with the [Board\u2019s] requests to provide the amount of Minimum Rest Period (\u2018MRP\u2019) exemptions taken by each [Bar Pilots\u2019] pilot. An MRP exemption occurs when there is less than twelve hours between the time a Pilot\u2019s turn ends (work shift ends) (represented on the pilot log under the heading \u2018BoB\u2019) and the time the Pilot\u2019s next turn begins (work shift begins) (represented on the pilot log under the heading \u2018Ride\u2019).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b487-4\">On April 5, 2012, the Attorney General, as counsel for the Board, responded that \u201cThe document you describe is not in the possession of [the Board], If the \u2018Pilot Log\u2019 exists, it is not a document prepared, owned, used or retained by [the Board]. The letter to you dated February 22, 2012, from Capt. Bruce Horton, the Port Agent, which you attached to your request, states that he does not maintain a document called the \u2018Pilot Log[.]\u2019 In any case, the Board\u2019s files do not contain such a document. [][] You state in your letter that the Board is required to produce documents that it does not possess because such documents are maintained by Captain Horton, who serves as Port Agent and also as President of [Bar Pilots], a private organization. To the extent that Captain Horton possesses documents that are producible under the [CPRA], he is subject to a direct request under the [CPRA].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b487-5\">On July 3, 2012, PMSA filed a \u201cVerified Petition for Writ of Mandate Directed to the Board of Pilot Commissioners and its Port Agent Ordering Compliance with the [CPRA].\u201d PMSA sought a peremptory writ directing the Board and Horton, in his capacity as Port Agent, to disclose the Pilot Logs. The trial court permitted Bar Pilots and Horton, in his capacity as the president of Bar Pilots, to intervene in the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-6\">The answer to the trial court mandate petition again denied that the Port Agent or Bar Pilots had or maintained a Pilot Log. On August 15, 2012, Horton submitted a declaration under penalty of perjury averring that \u201c[t]he Bar Pilots do not maintain any record or records entitled \u2018Pilot Log\u2019 and have not done so at any time during my membership. The Bar Pilots maintain a dataset that includes some of the types of information PMSA apparently seeks through its requests for \u2018Pilot Logs.\u2019 I do not use this dataset in performing my duties as Port Agent. The dataset is not provided to the Board or to members of the public.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b488-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>On September 18, 2012, after hearing argument, the trial court granted the writ in part, finding that \u201cThe Port Agent is a public official; among other things, the position was created by the Legislature.\u201d The court observed that \u201c[t]he problem here is that the person who acts as Port Agent has <em>both </em>a private and public incarnation . . . and is at least confirmed by the Board which in turn operates under state law to (i) regulate the actions of pilots and (ii) a wide variety of other things in the public interest. [Citations.] [][] The \u2018Pilot Logs\u2019 are documents used by the Port Agent in the execution of his public duties including, but not limited to, assigning pilots to vessels and preparing and administering pilot vacation time. These are necessary and convenient to the Port Agent\u2019s public duties and are public documents. [Citation.]\u201d The court ordered the Port Agent to, within 30 days, \u201cproduce, if extant, the requested \u2018Pilot Logs\u2019 from 2002 [through] 2011.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The court otherwise denied the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-4\">On September 24, 2012, the executive director of the Board and its custodian of records, Allen Garfinkle, filed a declaration with the court, averring that the Board did not have the requested Pilot Logs, that the Board does not prepare, own, use, or retain such documents, and that the Board \u201cdoes not now, and never has, possessed the [Pilot Logs].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b488-5\">On October 16, 2012, Horton submitted a declaration in response to the court\u2019s order, averring in pertinent part that: \u201c3. A small amount of information from the records of the Bar Pilots is submitted to [the Board] in compliance with the Port Agent\u2019s reporting duties under the Board\u2019s regulations. As Port Agent, I maintain and control this information. The vast majority of the information in the Bar Pilots\u2019 records, however, is not submitted to the Board. I maintain and control this latter category of records solely in my private capacity as President of the Bar Pilots. [][]... [][] 5. Some but not all of the information that [PMSA] asserts is contained in the \u2018Pilot Logs\u2019 is used by the Bar Pilots in preparing the report that the Bar Pilots, not the Port Agent, is required to submit to the Board under [Regulations] section 237[,.subdivision ](d).... I do not use this information in performing my duties as Port Agent. Specifically, I do not use the information to assign pilots to vessels, and I do not use it to prepare or administer pilot vacation time. I am informed and believe that the information used by the Bar Pilots for preparing the report under [Regulations] section 237[, subdivision ](d) could be retrieved by submitting a query to the electronic database created and maintained by the Bar Pilots. Prior to receiving PMSA\u2019s document demands, I was unaware of the existence of the database. I do not use, and have never used, the database in my capacity as Port Agent. I am unaware of any previous Port Agent ever using the database <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>for any purpose. I have never submitted a query to the database (or asked anyone to do so on my behalf) for any purpose, either in my capacity as Port Agent or in my private capacity as President of the Bar Pilots; to my knowledge, no previous Port Agent has ever done so.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b489-4\">The instant petitions for writ of mandate, seeking to vacate the order requiring production, were filed on October 15, 2012, by Bar Pilots, the Board, and Horton in his private and public capacities.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> On October 17, 2012, we issued a temporary stay of the trial court\u2019s order and set a schedule for briefing. On December 27, 2012, we ordered the petitions consolidated and issued an order to show cause why the requested relief should not be granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-5\">II. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b489-6\">A. <em>The CPRA</em></p>\n<p id=\"b489-7\">The CPRA \u201cprovides for the inspection of public records maintained by state and local agencies.\u201d <em>(California State University, Fresno Assn., Inc. v. Superior Court </em>(2001) 90 Cal.App.4th 810, 822 [108 Cal.Rptr.2d 870] (CSU).) \u201cThe Legislature enacted the CPRA in 1968 to give the public access to information in possession of public agencies in furtherance of the notion that government should be accountable for its actions and, in order to verify accountability, individuals must have access to government files. [Citation.]\u201d* <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> <em>(Gilbert v. City of San Jose </em>(2003) 114 Cal.App.4th 606, 610 [7 Cal.Rptr.3d 692].) \u201cDisclosure statutes such as the [CPRA] and the federal Freedom of Information Act were passed to ensure public access to vital information about the government\u2019s conduct of its business.\u201d <em>(CBS, Inc. v. Block </em>(1986) 42 Cal.3d 646, 656 [230 Cal.Rptr. 362, 725 P.2d 470].) \u201cThe CPRA embodies a strong policy in favor of disclosing public records. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Dixon </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(2009) 170 Cal.App.4th 1271, 1275 [88 Cal.Rptr.3d 847].)</p>\n<p id=\"b490-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>\u201c[T]he extent of the CPRA\u2019s coverage is a matter to be developed by the courts on a case-by-case basis. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(CSU, supra, </em>90 Cal.App.4th at p. 828.) \u201cThis decision-making process is an unavoidable consequence resulting from \u2018the \u201cmyriad organizational arrangements\u201d adopted \u201cfor getting the business of the government done.\u201d \u2019 [Citation.] Therefore, each arrangement must be examined in its own context. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Irwin Memorial, etc. v. American National Red Cross </em>(9th Cir. 1981) 640 F.2d 1051, 1054.)<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b490-4\">B. <em>Standard of Review</em></p>\n<p id=\"b490-5\">Interpretation of the CPRA and its application to undisputed facts is a question of law subject to de novo review. Factual findings made by the trial court will be upheld if based on substantial evidence. <em>(Versaci v. Superior Court </em>(2005) 127 Cal.App.4th 805, 812 [26 Cal.Rptr.3d 92].)</p>\n<p id=\"b490-6\">C. <em>Is the Port Agent a Public Officer</em></p>\n<p id=\"b490-7\">\u201c \u2018State agency\u2019 means every state office, <em>officer, </em>department, division, bureau, board, and commission or other state body or agency, except those agencies provided for in Article IV (except Section 20 thereof) or Article VI of the California Constitution.\u201d (\u00a7 6252, subd. (f), italics added.)<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> \u201cIn attempting to divine how broadly the term \u2018state agency\u2019 can be interpreted, we are limited by rules of statutory construction . . . . [f] \u2018 \u201cThe court\u2019s role in construing a statute is to \u2018ascertain the intent of the Legislature so as to effectuate the purpose of the law.\u2019 [Citations.]\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>(CSU, supra, </em>90 Cal.App.4th at pp. 828-829.)</p>\n<p id=\"b490-8\">The Board and Bar Pilots do not deny that the Board itself is a state agency but argue that the Port Agent does not meet any established criteria for being considered a state officer. The Port Agent is not among the Board\u2019s designated officers (see Regs., \u00a7\u00a7 206, 207) and is employed and compensated by Bar Pilots, not by the public. The Port Agent is not among the civil executive officers enumerated in section 1001<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> and is selected for the position by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>Bar Pilots\u2019s membership (apparently coextensive with his term as president) and is only \u201cconfirmed\u201d by the Board without any provision for his removal. (Harb. &amp; Nav. Code, \u00a7 1130; Regs., \u00a7 218, subd. (a).) The Board suggests that the position of Port Agent is \u201cbest viewed as a liaison between the licensed pilots and the Board.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b491-4\">The trial court concluded that the Port Agent is a public official because, \u201camong other things, the position was created by the Legislature.\u201d But the difficulty, as the trial court observed, is that the person acting as Port Agent \u201chas <em>both </em>a private and public incarnation . . . .\u201d Horton himself acknowledged, in his August 17, 2011 response to the CPRA request, that having one person in the \u201cdual capacity\u201d of both Port Agent and Bar Pilots president made it \u201csometimes difficult to distinguish between the \u2018private\u2019 and \u2018public\u2019 duties of the person who holds both positions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b491-5\">While the Port Agent, in his capacity as president of Bar Pilots, may have many entirely private duties and serve as \u201cliaison\u201d with the Board, he also has responsibilities imposed by statute and by administrative regulation. The Port Agent is charged with responsibility \u201cfor the general supervision and management of all matters related to the business and <em>official duties </em>of pilots.\u201d (Harb. &amp; Nav. Code, \u00a7 1130, subd. (b), italics added; Regs., \u00a7 218, subd. (b), italics added.) The Port Agent\u2019s enumerated duties include assigning pilots to vessels. (Regs., \u00a7 218, subd. (d)(1).)</p>\n<p id=\"b491-6\">No California appellate court has yet addressed the question we confront here. However, at least one federal court has found the Port Agent to be acting as an officer or agent of the Board when assigning pilots to vessels and consequently entitled to Eleventh Amendment governmental immunity from suit when performing this task. <em>(Regal Stone Ltd. v. Cota </em>(N.D.Cal., Sept. 7, 2010, No. 08-5098 SC) 2010 WL 3504846 <em>{Regal Stone).) </em>The <em>Regal Stone </em>litigation arose from the allision<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> of the M/V Cosco Busan with the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge on November 7, 2007, spilling approximately 53,000 gallons of bunker fuel into the San Francisco Bay. The plaintiffs sued the pilot at the time of the accident, John Cota, Mclsaac and his predecessor as Port Agent, Russell Nyborg, and Bar Pilots. Nyborg, Mclsaac and Bar Pilots were alleged to have permitted Cota to continue to serve as a pilot when he was \u201cmedically unfit\u201d and further alleged that Mclsaac negligently failed to close the bar to vessel traffic in the face of unsafe weather conditions. Nyborg and Mclsaac moved to dismiss the complaint on the ground that they were state officials immune from suit. Under the Eleventh Amendment to the United States Constitution, \u201ca state official is immune <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>from suit in federal court for actions taken in an official capacity . . . .\u201d <em>(California v. Deep Sea Research, Inc. </em>(1998) 523 U.S. 491, 502 [140 L.Ed.2d 626, 118 S.Ct. 1464].) The motion to dismiss specifically alleged that \u201cCaptains Mclsaac and [codefendant] Nyborg, Port Agents of the [Board] <em>are such </em>officials.\u201d (Italics added.) Accepting this argument, and noting, as did the trial court here, that the Port Agent \u201csometimes acts on behalf of the Bar Pilots, and sometimes on behalf of the Board,\u201d the court found that the plaintiffs\u2019 allegations against Nyborg and Mclsaac \u201cfocus on conduct performed on behalf of the Board, not on behalf of the Bar Pilots.\u201d The court found that Mclsaac and Nyborg were acting as officers or agents of the Board \u201cas a matter of law\u201d in supervision of Cota and therefore immune from suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-4\">The Board and the Port Agent correctly note that a federal trial court decision has no precedential value. <em>(United Firefighters of Los Angeles City v. City of Los Angeles </em>(1989) 210 Cal.App.3d 1095, 1115 [259 Cal.Rptr. 65].) PMSA cited the unpublished federal trial court decision in <em>Regal Stone </em>below, and cites it here as persuasive authority. (See <em>Pacific Shore Funding v. Lozo </em>(2006) 138 Cal.App.4th 1342, 1352, fn. 6 [42 Cal.Rptr.3d 283] [unpublished federal cases are citable as persuasive, although not precedential, authority].) The Board and the Port Agent also contend that \u201centirely different legal standards\u201d apply to the analysis of Eleventh Amendment sovereign immunity and application of the CPRA, but neither the Board nor the Port Agent attempts to articulate the purported analytical differences, and neither cites any authority for the argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-5\">We find the court\u2019s reasoning in <em>Regal Stone </em>to be persuasive in many respects. But we find it even more significant that it was the Port Agent (in that case Mclsaac) who argued for immunity from suit based on his status as a government official when assigning or supervising pilots, insisting in his pleadings that \u201cit is the Port Agent\u2019s official duty to assign pilots to vessels in accordance with the Board\u2019s guidelines\u201d and specifically citing to Regulations section 218, former subdivision (c)(1) (current subd. (d)(1)).<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The doctrine of judicial estoppel, sometimes referred to as the doctrine of preclusion of inconsistent positions, \u201c \u2018prevents a party from asserting a position in a legal proceeding that is contrary to a position previously taken in the same or some earlier proceeding.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Jackson v.

All are true here.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-5\">At oral argument, both the Port Agent and the Board sought to distinguish the factual context of <em>Regal Stone, </em>and they contended that it would be inequitable to apply the doctrine in this setting.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> (See <em>MW Erectors, Inc. v. Niederhauser Ornamental &amp; Metal Works Co., Inc. </em>(2005) 36 Cal.4th 412, 422-423 [30 Cal.Rptr.3d 755, 115 P.3d 41] [\u201cjudicial estoppel is an equitable doctrine, and its application, even where all necessary elements are present, is discretionary\u201d (italics omitted)]; <em>M.

But in <em>Regal Stone, </em>as in this matter, the Port Agent\u2019s role in the assignment of pilots, and whether he acts in an official capacity when doing so, was pivotal. And Mclsaac took the unequivocal position before the United States District Court that he was a state official, acting within the course and scope of that capacity, when assigning pilots. We fail to appreciate the inequity in refusing to allow the Port Agent to take an inconsistent position here. The Port Agent fails to explain why one should be permitted to assume the cloak of a state official when it provides protection but to then cast it off in the event it becomes burdensome. We find that the Port Agent must be considered a state officer, at least when performing the official duties provided by statute or Board regulation.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b494-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>D. <em>Are the Pilot Logs Public Records</em></p>\n<p id=\"b494-4\">For purposes of the CPRA, a public record is defined as \u201cany writing containing information relating to the conduct of the public\u2019s business prepared, owned, used, or retained by any state or local agency regardless of physical form or characteristics.\u201d (\u00a7 6252, subd.

As we have discussed, the Port Agent has both private and public incarnations. Bar Pilots is an independent association, with its own facilities and its own records of its operations, and the Port Agent concurrently serves as president of that association. There is no contention that Bar Pilots is a public agency or that its internal private records are subject to the CPRA, even though Bar Pilots makes required annual statistical reports to the Board, which are public records.

But we can find no competent evidence in the record before the trial court which would support such a finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-5\">1. <em>The Evidentiary Record</em></p>\n<p id=\"b496-6\">The so-called Pilot Logs apparently first came to light in connection with a federal income tax dispute litigated between the Internal Revenue Service and an individual member of Bar Pilots <em>(Miller, supra, </em>102 T.C.M. (CCH) 250). In that proceeding pilot Tom Miller, through counsel, joined in a written stipulation <em>(Miller </em>Stipulation), reciting that he was a \u201cpartner\u201d in Bar Pilots.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> The stipulation, dated October 18, 2010, included two exhibits (referred to in this litigations as the Pilot Logs) identified as \u201cthe [Bar Pilots] piloting record\u201d for Miller for 2005 and 2006 and further described the documents as having been \u201ccreated by [Bar Pilots] in the normal course of business to keep track of a Pilot\u2019s time pursuant to [Regulations section] 237[, subdivisions ](d), (f)(1)\u201d and \u201cto comply with [the Board\u2019s] requests to provide the amount of [MRP] exemptions taken by each . . . Pilot.\u201d The <em>Miller </em>Stipulation also provided detailed explanations for the data columns presented in the Pilot Logs.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-7\">The <em>Miller </em>Stipulation and the attached Pilot Logs for Miller were included as exhibits to PMSA\u2019s petition for writ of mandate in the trial court. The Attorney General made written objection to all PMSA exhibits as lacking foundation and authentication and as hearsay. The Attorney General specifically objected to the \u201cunauthenticated records from a tax court matter\u201d as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>\u201cirrelevant to any issue presented in this case.\u201d The trial court did not conduct an evidentiary hearing, nor did it expressly rule on any of the evidentiary objections by either side. At oral argument before the trial court, the Attorney General again objected to the court\u2019s consideration of the <em>Miller </em>documents and argued that the only competent evidence before the court concerning the Pilot Logs was the Port Agent\u2019s declaration that he used no such records in the performance of his duties.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-4\">In responding to the January 4, 2012 CPRA request, Horton denied that there was any document maintained by the Port Agent named the Pilot Log, but said that \u201c[t]here is a data set that bears headings that are similar to those set forth in your e-mail to [Board counsel] of January 30, 2012.\u201d Horton said that the data, however, was not used by the Port Agent in assigning pilots to vessels or in preparing or administering the pilots\u2019 vacation schedule and was not supplied to the Board. He insisted that \u201c[t]he documents containing this data are documents that are maintained by [Bar Pilots] in its capacity as a private organization and not in connection with any duties imposed upon the Port Agent by statute or by the regulations of [the Board].\u201d Similarly, in responding to the May 26, 2012 request, the Board replied that it had no Pilot Log in its possession, and there \u201cis not a document prepared, owned, used or retained by [the Board].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b497-5\">In response to the trial court\u2019s disclosure order, on August 15, 2012, Horton submitted another declaration under penalty of perjury reiterating his earlier declaration that, while \u201c \u2018the Bar Pilots maintain a dataset that includes some of the types of information PMSA apparently seeks through its requests for \u201cPilot Logs[,]\u201d I do not use this dataset in performing my duties as Port Agent. The dataset is not provided to the Board or to members of the public.\u2019 \u201d On October 16, 2012, Horton submitted another declaration, stating, \u201c. . . Some but not all of the information that [PMSA] asserts is contained in the \u2018Pilot Logs\u2019 is used by the Bar Pilots in preparing the report that the Bar Pilots, not the Port Agent, is required to submit to the Board under [Regulations] section 237[, subdivision ](d) .... I do not use this information in performing my duties as Port Agent. Specifically, I do not use the information to assign pilots to vessels, and I do not use it to prepare or administer pilot vacation time. . . . Prior to receiving PMSA\u2019s document demands, I was unaware of the existence of the database. I do not use, and have never used, the database in my capacity as Port Agent. I am unaware of any previous Port Agent ever using the database for any purpose. I have never submitted a query to the database (or asked anyone to do so on my behalf) for any purpose, either in my capacity as Port Agent or in my private capacity as President of the Bar Pilots; to my knowledge, no previous Port Agent has ever done so.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b498-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>2. <em>Discussion</em></p>\n<p id=\"b498-4\">The issue is not whether a database containing some or all of the information requested by PMSA exists. The Port Agent admits that it does, and that it is owned and used by Bar Pilots. Nor is the issue an undeniable public interest in the safe navigation of vessels in our waterways and avoidance of serious environmental, political, and business consequences that may result from pilot errors.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Rather, the question is whether any evidence exists that the information is possessed and used by the Port Agent in the performance of his official duties and is consequently a public record. We find that there does not.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-5\">PMSA relied in the trial court, and relies here, on the <em>Miller </em>Stipulation and attached Pilot Logs as evidence \u201cof the existence, source and nature of the documents sought under the CPRA and the extent of the Port Agent\u2019s role and duties as a public official.\u201d But how? PMSA contends that the trial court properly took judicial notice of the <em>Miller </em>documents because they are records of a court of the United States and not subject to reasonable dispute. Despite PMSA\u2019s assertion to the contrary, the <em>Miller </em>Stipulation and the Pilot Logs are unquestionably hearsay, their content was disputed, and both the Board and Bar Pilots repeatedly objected to their consideration. PMSA insists that the <em>Miller </em>Stipulation and Pilot Logs are not hearsay because they were \u201cnot offered for the truth of the matter of the content therein, but to show that, for purposes of CPRA disclosure only, the Pilot Logs exist and reflect the daily activities of the Port Agent to execute his public duties to assign pilots to vessels and to collect data.\u201d Even if the Pilot Logs from the <em>Miller </em>case could be considered to establish the existence of an information database, statements contained in the <em>Miller </em>Stipulation are the only authentication or explanation for any of the information contained within <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>the Pilot Logs and the only basis for the claim that the Pilot Logs \u201creflect the daily activities of the Port Agent to execute his public duties to assign pilots to vessels and to collect data.\u201d While judicial notice may be taken of court records (Evid. Code, \u00a7 452, subd. (d)), the truth of matters asserted in such documents is not subject to judicial notice. <em>(Arce, supra, </em>181 Cal.App.4th at p. 482.)<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b499-4\">In response to evidentiary objections in the trial court, PMSA asserted that the <em>Miller </em>Stipulation \u201cdirectly admit[s] that the Port Agent\u2019s recordation of the assignment of pilots is undertaken in the regular course of business in order to fully and accurately comply with a reporting requirement of the state of California\u201d and that \u201cthese statements are directly relevant as admissions against interest, since Miller was and is a member of [Bar Pilots].\u201d But there was no evidence presented that Miller is, or ever has been, an officer of Bar Pilots, that he had personal knowledge of any of the business records of Bar ' Pilots, or that he was authorized in any way to speak on its behalf. And the stipulation is not even a sworn declaration by Miller. It is the product of yet another layer of hearsay\u2014an unverified document submitted and signed by Miller\u2019s counsel, who does not purport to have personal knowledge of any of the content.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-5\">In contrast, the Port Agent avers that he does not, and has not, prepared or used the Pilot Logs in assigning pilots, and both the Port Agent and the Board confirm that the database is not provided to the Board. In sum, there is no evidence, let alone substantial evidence, to support a finding that the Pilot Logs are \u201cused by the Port Agent in the execution of his public duties including, but not limited to, assigning pilots to vessels and preparing and administering pilot vacation time\u201d or that they are \u201cnecessary and convenient to the Port Agent\u2019s public duties.\u201d In the absence of such evidence, the database of the Pilot Logs cannot be considered public records under the CPRA.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-6\">E. <em>Constructive Possession of the Pilot Logs by the Board</em></p>\n<p id=\"b499-7\">Both PMSA and Amici Curiae argue that records relating to execution of the Port Agent\u2019s public duties are also public records because they are in the constructive possession of the Port Agent and the Board. The CPRA pertains to \u201cdisclosable public records in the <em>possession </em>of the agency.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>(\u00a7 6253, subd. (c), italics added.) Relying upon the Board\u2019s general administrative control of the Port Agent and its authority over all licensed pilots and pilot reporting requirements (Regs., \u00a7\u00a7 218, 219), PMSA insists that both the Board and the Port Agent have the right to control the Pilot Log database maintained by Bar Pilots and are therefore in \u201cpossession\u201d of those records.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-4\">As to the Port Agent, the argument reaches too far. Under PMSA\u2019s theory, any and all records held or maintained by a private organization would become public record simply because one of its officers concurrently held a position performing public functions. Whether the record is in the actual or constructive possession of a public official, the requirement is still that the record be required by law to be kept by that official, or that it be \u201c \u2018 \u201cnecessary or convenient to the discharge of his official duty.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>(San Gabriel Tribune, supra, </em>143 Cal.App.3d at p. 774; see <em>CSU, supra, </em>90 Cal.App.4th at p. 824.)</p>\n<p id=\"b500-5\">As to the Board, to prevail PMSA must establish that the files (1) qualify as public records and (2) were in the possession of the Board. <em>(Consolidated Irrigation Dist. v. Superior Court </em>(2012) 205 Cal.App.4th 697, 709 [140 Cal.Rptr.3d 622] <em>(Consolidated Irrigation).) </em>\u201cPossession\u201d in this context has been interpreted to mean both actual and constructive possession. \u201c[A]n agency has constructive possession of records if it has the right to control the records, either directly or through another person. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 710.) PMSA relies primarily on <em>Bernardi v. County of Monterey </em>(2008) 167 Cal.App.4th 1379 [84 Cal.Rptr.3d 754] <em>(Bernardi) </em>in support of its argument. Neither <em>Consolidated Irrigation </em>nor <em>Bernardi </em>is factually analogous.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-6\">In <em>Consolidated Irrigation, </em>the petitioner challenged the approval of an environmental impact report (EIR) by the City of Selma (City) and sought a writ of mandate to compel production under the CPRA of, inter alia, records of subconsultants hired by a primary consultant to prepare reports, studies, or certain sections of the EIR. <em>(Consolidated Irrigation, supra, 205 </em>Cal.App.4th at pp. 702, 709-710.) The trial court denied the petition. The petitioner contended that the City had the right to control the subconsultants\u2019 files based on a provision in the contract between City and the primary consultant that expressly gave the City ownership of all documents and data prepared by the contractor. The petitioner was given access to the contractor\u2019s files, and constructive possession of the documents in the contractor\u2019s file was not at issue. The court concluded that the contract provision did not give the City ownership rights in the materials in the subconsultant\u2019s files and affirmed denial of the petition. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 709-711.) Nothing in the Harbors and Navigation Code or in the Board\u2019s regulations gives the Board any rights of ownership of Bar Pilots\u2019s records, and Bar Pilots is not a contractual agent of the Board. As PMSA acknowledges, there is no reference to Bar Pilots in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>the Harbors and Navigation Code. <em>Bemardi </em>dealt only with the reasonableness of an award of attorney fees to a successful CPRA petitioner. The trial court\u2019s order requiring production of the environmental consultant\u2019s file was not appealed. <em>(Bemardi, supra, </em>167 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1383, 1392.) \u201cAn appellate decision is not authority for everything said in the court\u2019s opinion but only \u2018for the points actually involved and actually decided.\u2019 [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Santisas </em>v. <em>Goodin </em>(1998) 17 Cal.4th 599, 620 [71 Cal.Rptr.2d 830, 951 P.2d 399].)</p>\n<p id=\"b501-4\">Amici Curiae contend that the Board has the right to obtain the Pilot Log records and therefore \u201cowns\u201d those records. They cite <em>San Gabriel Tribune </em>for the proposition that if an agency delegates a duty to a third party, but retains the power and duty to monitor performance of the delegated duty, the third party records relating to the performance of that duty are public. <em>San Gabriel Tribune </em>also involved a contractual agreement, in that instance between a municipality and trash collection service. The trash collection company had a contractual obligation to submit annual financial statements to the city, and the records in dispute consisted of financial data that the company submitted to the city to justify a rate increase the city authorized. <em>(San Gabriel Tribune, supra, </em>143 Cal.App.3d at pp. 767-769.) The court held that those statements were public records subject to disclosure because the contractor had \u201cinjected the data into the decision-making process of government\u201d <em>(id. </em>at p. 778) and \u201cthe City [had] relied on [the statements] in granting the rate increase . . .\u201d <em>(id. </em>at p. 775). Here the Board has \u201cdelegated\u201d nothing, by contract or otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-5\">PMSA suggests that Board is \u201coutsourc[ing] the \u2018performance of administrative functions\u2019 \u201d and that Bar Pilots \u201cis, in many respects, a functional subordinate of the public agency and subject to the execution of its public duties.\u201d Bar pilotage is a recognized but regulated monopoly, and the Board has statutory licensing and oversight authority. But the individually licensed members of Bar Pilots render piloting services directly to their maritime clients, not on behalf of the Board. The pilot work rules are generally established by Bar Pilots and not by the Board. And the Legislature has never given the Board the authority to make pilot assignments or to direct them. The Port Agent has always been allocated that responsibility, and we have already held that he serves as a state officer in doing so.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-6\">Nor does the record support Amici Curiae\u2019s argument that the Board is attempting to \u201cdefeat disclosure by ceding possession and control of [the records] to a third party.\u201d So far as the evidence discloses, the database at issue has always been solely prepared and maintained by Bar Pilots and never <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>provided to the Board, although apparently used in part in preparation of the summary statistical reports from Bar Pilots to the Board required under Regulations section 237, subdivision (d). But the fact that Bar Pilots may use the Pilot Log database to prepare its public summary does not mean that all data used to prepare the report is thereby public. (See <em>Forsham v. Harris, supra, </em>445 U.S. at pp. 171-179 [written data generated, owned and possessed by a privately controlled organization funded solely by federal grants are not records of the federal agency providing the grants if they are not provided to the agency, even if there is a federal right of access to the data].)</p>\n<p id=\"b502-4\">F. <em>Conclusion</em></p>\n<p id=\"b502-5\">The evidentiary record before us does not support a finding that the Pilot Log data is, or ever has been, used by the Port Agent in the performance of his official duty in assignment of bar pilots and is consequently a public record. If the data itself is not a public record, the fact that the Board could theoretically request it from Bar Pilots does not make it so.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-6\">We do not dismiss the public\u2019s interest, articulated by PMSA and Amici Curiae, in safe pilotage of large vessels in the environmentally sensitive confines of the San Francisco Bay. We do not doubt that historic records reflecting individual exemptions from what are now only recommended MRP\u2019s in piloting assignments may \u201cshed light on the . . . process of assigning pilots to vessels\u201d as PMSA contends. But records otherwise private do not become public simply by virtue of public interest in their content.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-7\">As a consequence of well-publicized maritime accidents, the NTSB has recommended that state licensing boards promulgate \u201chours of service\u201d rules to prevent pilot fatigue. A legislative committee recently recommended that the Board conduct a manpower utilization study based on actual pilot logs. Our Legislature has now acted on both recommendations, requiring the Board to study the effects of work and rest periods on psychological ability and safety for pilots, and to promulgate pilot regulations establishing requirements for adequate rest periods. (Harb. &amp; Nav. Code, \u00a7 1196.5.) Presumably the information that PMSA seeks will come to light in that process.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-8\">III. Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b502-9\">The petitions filed in this court are granted. Let a peremptory writ of mandate issue directing the superior court to set aside and vacate its September 18, 2012 order granting PMSA\u2019s petition for writ of mandate and to enter a new and different order denying that petition.

(Harb. &amp; Nav. Code, \u00a7 1150, subd. (a).) The controversy here seems to be focused on the issue of requiring MRP\u2019s (minimum rest periods) for pilots to avoid fatigue. A January 23, 2010 vessel incident in Port Arthur, Texas, resulted in an investigation by the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) and recommendation that state licensing boards promulgate \u201chours of service\u201d rules to prevent pilot fatigue. A legislative Joint Sunset Review Committee (\u00a7 9147.7, subd. (c)), on February 5, 2012, recommended that the Board promulgate hours of service regulations for pilots in accordance with the NTSB report. The Board, on July 26, 2012, adopted additional reporting requirements for MRP\u2019s for pilots. Our Legislature recently amended the Harbors and Navigation Code to require the Board to \u201cconduct a study of the effects of work and rest periods on psychological ability and safety for pilots\u201d and make \u201crecommendations on how to prevent pilot fatigue and ensure the safe operation of vessels.\u201d (Harb. &amp; Nav. Code, \u00a7 1196.5, subd. (a).) Based on the results of the study, the Board will be required to \u201cpromulgate regulations for pilots establishing requirements for adequate rest periods intended to prevent pilot fatigue.\u201d (Harb. &amp; Nav. Code, \u00a7 1196.5, subd. (b).) There are no current regulations on the subject. The Bar Pilots\u2019s work rules, calling for 12-hour MRP\u2019s, are only volunt\u00e1ry guidelines.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b495-7\"> To assist the Board in determining the number of pilot\u2019s licenses to be issued, the Bar Pilots are required to provide a report that includes such information as numbers of vessel moves, bar crossings, bay and river moves; average draft and gross registered tonnage of piloted vessels; numbers of pilots reported sick or injured and the number of days each was unable to perform piloting duties; number of times a pilot resumed duties with less than 12 hours off duty, the contributing circumstances, and actual hours off duty between assignments; and number of days pilots were engaged in Board-mandated training or administrative duties authorized by the Port Agent.

PMSA contends that the documents (which were not provided to the trial court) demonstrate that the pilot assignment data is utilized by both the Board and the Port Agent, and that they \u201cdemonstrate the profound public interest in the information PMSA seeks.\u201d We deny the request because we do not find them relevant. <em>(Arce v.

The Bar Pilots annual report is itself a public record (Regs., \u00a7 237, subd. (d)), but that does not thereby make public the records from which the report is produced. <em>(Forsham v.
