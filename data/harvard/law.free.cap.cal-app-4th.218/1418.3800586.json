In 1996, when she was 12 years old, she made a partial disclosure to her mother, stating only that defendant had touched her breast once. As a result, her mother made defendant move out of the house. In 1999, when his daughter was 15 years old, defendant moved back in and started groping her again. In 2002, when she was 18 years old, defendant left the family to live with another woman. At that point, his daughter finally disclosed the full scope of the molestation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1199-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1421\">*1421</page-number>In 2003, defendant was charged with nine counts of a nonforcible lewd act on a child under 14 (Pen. Code, \u00a7 288, subd. (a)) and 13 counts of a lewd act on a child under 16 (Pen. Code, \u00a7 288, subd. (c)(1)). He fled the country. In 2010, he was located and extradited. In 2011, his trial on these charges resulted in a hung jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b1199-5\">The prosecution then filed an amended information charging defendant with six counts of a nonforcible lewd act on a child under 14 and six counts of a lewd act on a child under 16. In defendant\u2019s second trial, the jury found him guilty as charged. He was sentenced to a total of 16 years in prison, plus the usual fines and fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b1199-6\">Defendant now contends (among other things) that, with respect to the six counts of a lewd act on a child under 14, the statute of limitations had run. In the published portion of this opinion, we will hold that, as a matter of law, the statute of limitations had not run, because the evidence showed that the molestations continued to occur at least once a week throughout 1995, and because the limitations period, initially six years, was extended to 10 years before the six-year period had expired. In the nonpublished portion, we find no other prejudicial error. Hence, we will affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1199-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b1199-8\">FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"A90\">A. <em>Sexual Touchings: 1993 through 1996.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1199-9\">Defendant and his wife had two children\u2014Jane Doe<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and Jane\u2019s younger brother. Jane was bom in January 1984.</p>\n<p id=\"b1199-10\">Starting when Jane was eight or nine and in fourth or fifth grade,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> defendant began touching her sexually. Typically, when Jane was lying down, in bed or on a couch, defendant would approach her and start massaging her back. He would touch her breasts or her buttocks. Then he would rub her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1422\">*1422</page-number>vaginal area, under her clothing. This happened at least once a week. Jane wanted to tell her mother, but she was too embarrassed, and she thought she would get in trouble.</p>\n<p id=\"b1200-5\">In January 1996, when Jane was 12 and in sixth grade, she was upset about something (by the time of trial, she no longer remembered what), so she told her mother that defendant had touched her breast; she did not disclose any of the other sexual touching. Her mother immediately confronted defendant and \u201ckicked him out.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1200-6\">The family started going to counseling. The counselor reported the breast touching to the police. As a result, in August 1996, defendant pleaded guilty to one count of child molestation in violation of Penal Code section 647.6, a misdemeanor, allegedly committed in December 1995.</p>\n<p id=\"b1200-7\">B. <em>Renewed Sexual Touchings, Mirrors, and Holes in the Wall: 1999 through 2002.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1200-8\">In early 1999, Jane\u2019s mother let defendant move back in. About six months later, defendant started touching Jane sexually again. Typically, when Jane was in bed, asleep, defendant would rub her back, then touch her breasts and buttocks and rub her vagina on the outside of her clothes. At first, Jane felt frozen and could not move. Then she would pretend she was just waking up, and he would stop. This happened about once or twice a week, though some weeks, it did not happen at all. Jane did not tell anybody about it because she was afraid of breaking up the family again.</p>\n<p id=\"b1200-9\">When Jane was about 16, she had a lock put on her bedroom door. After that, the touchings \u201cpretty much stopped.\u201d \u201c[A] couple [of] times,\u201d however, when Jane was getting dressed for school, she saw a small mirror slide under the door. It was a mechanic\u2019s mirror on a pole, such as defendant used in his work. This stopped after she stuffed a towel under the door.</p>\n<p id=\"b1200-10\">One time, Jane looked into \u00e1n uncovered cable outlet between her room and her brother\u2019s room and saw defendant looking back at her. She moved her nightstand to cover the outlet.</p>\n<p id=\"b1200-11\">Jane started finding holes in the walls of her room. She blocked them with toilet paper or plaster. Jane told her mother that she thought defendant was watching her through holes in the wall, but her mother did not believe her.</p>\n<p id=\"b1201-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1423\">*1423</page-number>C. <em>Disclosure: 2002.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1201-5\">In January or February 2002, defendant moved out. The family soon realized that he was having an affair with his wife\u2019s 23-year-old niece, Patricia.</p>\n<p id=\"b1201-6\">Patricia promptly became pregnant. Patricia would telephone Jane and other family members and mock them; she said that Jane and her family would have to leave their house because it belonged to her now. In response, Jane told Patricia that she was going to beat her up. Meanwhile, defendant told Jane that he did not want her or her brother to visit him at work or telephone him.</p>\n<p id=\"b1201-7\">Jane felt betrayed because \u201c[she] had kept quiet to keep [her] family together\u201d and now it was \u201cpointless.\u201d Hence, on February 11, 2002, Jane called the police. At this point, she was 18.</p>\n<p id=\"b1201-8\">Deputy Timothy Cleary conducted a preliminary interview of Jane. She told him that in 1996, she had reported that defendant had touched her breast, but actually, there had been additional incidents of sexual abuse; when she was between nine and 12, defendant had touched her breast and vaginal area on a regular basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b1201-9\">Jane also said that defendant was no longer touching her sexually; however, he would caress her hair and rub her back, supposedly to wake her up. She said she had put a lock on her door because she was afraid he would start touching her again. She did not say that defendant had in fact resumed touching her sexually. She mentioned the mirror under her door but did not mention the holes in the wall.</p>\n<p id=\"b1201-10\">In April 2002, Deputy Matthew Aveling, a trained child-sex-crime investigator, conducted a followup interview. Jane\u2019s statement to him was essentially consistent with her testimony at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1201-11\">D. <em>Pretext Meeting.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1201-12\">In May 2002, at Deputy Aveling\u2019s suggestion, Jane engaged in a pretext meeting with defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b1202-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1424\">*1424</page-number>During the meeting, Jane never explicitly accused defendant of a sexual offense. For example, she started by saying she wanted to talk \u201c[a]bout everything that\u2019s happened.\u201d However, she did say, \u201cI\u2019m not talking about the divorce.\u201d She asked him to say he was sorry.</p>\n<p id=\"b1202-5\">Defendant said: \u201cYou know I\u2019m sorry what I did. I\u2014I\u2019m not really sorry for what I did, I\u2019m really sorry that I hurt you. I didn\u2019t think you were gonna take it like that.\u201d Similarly, he said: \u201cI am sorry. Not for what happened, I\u2019m sorry . . . that you got hurt.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1202-6\">Jane did say: \u201cAnd you think I never fuckin\u2019 saw you? With a mirror under my door?\u201d Defendant replied: \u201cHey. I\u2019m not talking about that.\u201d She accused him of making holes in the walls, but he denied this.</p>\n<p id=\"b1202-7\">Jane also said: \u201cI was like, asleep in my room, and you would come in and try to wake me up. And you thought I was asleep. I wasn\u2019t asleep.\u201d Defendant responded: \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you ever answer?\u201d \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you answer when I asked you?\u201d \u201cWhen I tried to wake you up?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1202-8\">Defendant also asked: \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you go to your mom? . . . [W]hy didn\u2019t you tell your mom back then?\u201d Jane answered that she was \u201cscared.\u201d Defendant said: \u201cScared? . . . [Y]ou didn\u2019t never look like you were scared.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1202-9\">E. <em>Defendant\u2019s Partial Confession.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1202-10\">On May 30, 2002, Deputy Aveling interviewed defendant. Defendant said that Jane was threatening to accuse him falsely of rape because she was angry about his relationship with Patricia.</p>\n<p id=\"b1202-11\">On June 12, 2002, Michelle Gamboa, a police interviewer, interviewed defendant. This time, he admitted touching Jane inappropriately on two occasions\u2014one involving a pool and one involving VapoRub.</p>\n<p id=\"b1202-12\">That same day, Deputy Aveling <em>Mirandized</em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark><em> </em>defendant and interviewed him again. Defendant once again admitted the pool incident and the VapoRub incident.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1202-13\">In the pool incident, according to defendant, Jane was 15; they were on vacation in San Felipe, Mexico. While she and defendant were \u201cplaying <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1425\">*1425</page-number>around\u201d in a pool, defendant \u201cfelt [her] vagina.\u201d \u201cI took my hand off[,] I went back for breast[,] and then ... I went back and touched her again.\u201d \u201c[E]very once in a while I would slide my hand and I touched it.\u201d When asked if he became aroused, defendant said: \u201cNot an erection aroused[,] but I did . . . feel warmth.\u201d That night, he and his wife had \u201cgood, good sex.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1203-5\">In the VapoRub incident, defendant said, Jane was sick, so he rubbed Vicks VapoRub on her back, buttocks, and thighs; he became aroused, so he left the room. He then took a shower and masturbated while \u201c[t]hinking about this.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1203-6\">Deputy Aveling told defendant that, according to Jane, defendant had touched her breast and vagina while playing. Defendant admitted that this had happened; at first, he said it happened \u201cthree or four\u201d times, but later, he said it happened \u201cten, twenty times.\u201d He agreed that it made him \u201cexcited,\u201d but he pretended it was \u201can accident.\u201d He also agreed that he had committed a crime, that he knew it was wrong, and that he was remorseful.</p>\n<p id=\"b1203-7\">When told that he was accused of touching Jane\u2019s breasts and crotch while she was asleep in bed or on a couch, defendant said: \u201cThat\u2019s a lie.\u201d However, he admitted that once, when she was lying on her stomach in his room, he massaged her back, buttocks, and legs; he touched her inner thighs, but not her crotch. He also touched her breast. He got an erection but did not masturbate. He volunteered that Jane had \u201cpretty good breast[s]\u201d; \u201cthey pop out.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1203-8\">Defendant admitted that he once tried to see Jane naked by sliding a mirror under her door, but he claimed it did not work. He also admitted making a hole once and trying to look at her through it, but that did not work either. He admitted that Jane \u201ccan probably think of more incidents] than I can . . . .\u201d At the end of the interview, he was arrested.</p>\n<p id=\"b1203-9\">In 2003, sometime after his preliminary hearing, defendant fled to Mexico.</p>\n<p id=\"b1203-10\">By 2008 or so, Jane was ready to forgive defendant, and they started talking again. Defendant asked her to help make \u201cthe charges go away.\u201d She responded that she \u201cwasn\u2019t going to lie.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1203-11\">In 2010, defendant was located in Canada, arrested, and extradited.</p>\n<p id=\"b1204-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1426\">*1426</page-number>F. <em>Child Sexual Abuse Accommodation Syndrome.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1204-5\">An expert psychologist testified about child sexual abuse accommodation syndrome. In particular, she testified that most children who are sexually abused by a family member will delay disclosing the abuse for months or years until some kind of crisis. When they do disclose, they may do so only partially, \u201ctesting the water.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1204-6\">G. <em>Defense Evidence.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1204-7\">Defendant took the stand. He admitted touching Jane\u2019s breast, resulting in his 1996 guilty plea. However, he claimed that the touching was not sexual. Jane would not give him the remote control for the television, so he \u201cpinched her boob.\u201d Otherwise, he denied ever touching Jane inappropriately. He denied trying to look at her with a mirror or through holes.</p>\n<p id=\"b1204-8\">Defendant claimed that, during the pretext meeting, he thought Jane was asking him to apologize for his relationship with Patricia. When he asked why she did not tell her mom, he meant about the mirrors and holes.</p>\n<p id=\"b1204-9\">Defendant also claimed that he lied to Deputy Aveling because Deputy Aveling told him if he \u201cg[a]ve him something that he can work with,\u201d he could go home.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Also, when Deputy Aveling said something and defendant responded, \u201cRight,\u201d defendant was not necessarily agreeing; he was just acknowledging the statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b1204-10\">Defendant went to Mexico because he felt he \u201cwasn\u2019t getting a fair trial . . . .\u201d He claimed that, at the request of his bail bondsman, he turned himself in to the Mexican police, but he was released because the Riverside authorities declined to extradite him.</p>\n<p id=\"b1204-11\">Jane\u2019s mother did not remember Jane getting a lock for her bedroom door. Jane\u2019s brother testified that the door already had a lock before defendant moved back in.</p>\n<p id=\"b1205-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1427\">*1427</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b1205-5\">THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS</p>\n<p id=\"ATh\">A. <em>Additional Factual and Procedural Background.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1205-6\">1. <em>The initial complaint.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1205-7\">The initial complaint was filed in August 2002. It alleged that defendant committed four violations of Penal Code section 288, subdivision (a)(2). The first two allegedly occurred between January 12, 1993, and November 30, 1995; the last two allegedly occurred between February 1, 1996, and January 11, 1997.</p>\n<p id=\"b1205-8\">2. <em>The initial information.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1205-9\">The initial information was filed in March 2003. It alleged that defendant committed nine violations of Penal Code section 288, subdivision (a)(2). The first three allegedly occurred between January and December 1994; the next three allegedly occurred between January and December 1995; and the last three allegedly occurred between January and April 1996.</p>\n<p id=\"b1205-10\">3. <em>The amended information.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1205-11\">The amended information was filed in June 2011. It alleged that defendant committed six violations of Penal Code section 288, subdivision (a)(2), all between January 1994 and November 1995. It further alleged that Jane reported these offenses to a law enforcement agency on February 11, 2002.</p>\n<p id=\"b1205-12\">B. <em>Analysis.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1205-13\">Defendant did not raise the statute of limitations in the trial court. However, \u201cwhen the charging document indicates on its face that the action is time-barred, a person convicted of a charged offense may raise the statute of limitations at any time,\u201d including on appeal. <em>(People v. Williams </em>(1999) 21 Cal.4th 335, 341 [87 Cal.Rptr.2d 412, 981 P.2d 42].) Thereafter, if the record establishes that the action is not time-barred, the conviction may stand; if, however, the appellate court cannot determine from the record whether the action is time-barred, it should remand for a further hearing. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 341, 345-346.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1205-14\">If, on the other hand, the charging document does allege that the action is timely, any objection to the sufficiency of the evidence to prove timeliness must be raised in the trial court in the first instance\u2014typically, by requesting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1428\">*1428</page-number>a jury instruction on the subject. \u201c[A] defendant may forfeit factual issues relating to the statute of limitations when ... the information alleges facts indicating that the prosecution was timely.\u201d <em>(People v. Simmons </em>(2012) 210 Cal.App.4th 778, 793 [148 Cal.Rptr.3d 554]; accord, <em>People </em>v. <em>Thomas </em>(2007) 146 Cal.App.4th 1278, 1288 [53 Cal.Rptr.3d 473].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1206-5\">Here, we need not decide whether the relevant charging document (regardless of whether that is the original information or the amended information) adequately alleged that the action was timely. If it did, then defendant forfeited his present contention by failing to raise it below. If, on the other hand, it did not, then defendant did not have to raise his present contention below; however, as long as the evidence at trial established that the action was, in fact, timely, we may affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1206-6\">According to Jane\u2019s testimony, the sexual touching occurred at least once a week \u201cfrom when it started, [when she was] around eight or nine, up until when it stopped, when [she] w[as] around 12.\u201d In January 1996, when Jane was 12, she told her mother that defendant had touched her breast, and her mother kicked defendant out of the house. Defendant indirectly confirmed that the lewd acts continued into late 1995, by pleading guilty to the alleged breast touching. This evidence established that defendant committed at least six violations of Penal Code section 288, subdivision (a) in 1995.</p>\n<p id=\"b1206-7\">This conclusion\u2014that the crimes may be deemed to have been committed in 1995\u2014is the key point at which our analysis diverges from defendant\u2019s. We will discuss defendant\u2019s contrary arguments below. First, however, we explain how this conclusion necessarily means that the prosecution was timely.</p>\n<p id=\"b1206-8\">The maximum penalty for a violation of Penal Code section 288, subdivision (a) is eight years. (Pen. Code, \u00a7 288, subd. (a), in effect since at least 1982, as amended by Stats. 1981, ch. 1064, \u00a7 1, p. 4093.) As of 1995, the basic statute of limitations for a crime punishable by imprisonment for a maximum of eight years or more required that the \u201cprosecution ... be commenced within six years after commission of the offense.\u201d (Pen. Code, \u00a7 800, in effect since at least 1985, added by Stats. 1984, ch. \u00cd270, \u00a7 2, p. 4335; see Pen. Code, \u00a7 805, subd. (a), in effect since at least 1985, added by Stats. 1984, ch. 1270, \u00a7 2, pp. 4335^1336.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1206-9\">A prosecution is commenced, as relevant here, when an information is filed. (Pen. Code, \u00a7 804, in effect since at least 1985, added by Stats. 1984, ch. 1270, \u00a7 2, pp. 4335-4336.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1206-10\">Effective January 1, 2001, the Legislature enacted an alternative limitations period for specified sex crimes, including a lewd act on a child <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1429\">*1429</page-number>(see Pen. Code, \u00a7 290, former subd. (a)(2)(A), in effect since at least Jan. 1, 2001, as amended by Stats. 2000, ch. 649, \u00a7 2.5, pp. 4282-4284, renumbered as Pen. Code, \u00a7 290, subd. (c), eff. Oct. 13, 2007, added by Stats. 2007, ch. 579, \u00a7 8, pp. 4811-4812); prosecution could be \u201ccommenc[ed] ... 10 years from the commission of the offense,\u201d but only if the basic six-year period had not yet expired as of January 1, 2001 (Pen. Code, \u00a7 803, former subd. (h)(2), as amended by Stats. 2000, ch. 235, \u00a7 1, pp. 2338-2342, renumbered as Pen. Code, \u00a7 803, former subd. (i)(2), as amended by Stats. 2001, ch. 235, \u00a7 1, pp. 2121-2126, renumbered as Pen. Code, former \u00a7 801.1, added by Stats. 2004, ch. 368, \u00a7 1, p. 3470).</p>\n<p id=\"b1207-5\">Here, with respect to violations of Penal Code section 288, subdivision (a), committed from January 1 through December 31, 1995, the basic six-year limitations period did not expire until January 1 through December 31, 2001, respectively. Accordingly, when the new 10-year limitations period came into effect, the basic six-year period had not yet expired. Moreover, as of March 2003, when the original information was filed, the 15-year limitations period had not expired. Thus, the original information was timely.</p>\n<p id=\"b1207-6\">Finally, the amended information did not charge any new or additional violations of Penal Code section 288, subdivision (a). The original information had charged a total of nine: three occurring in 1994, three occurring in 1995 and three occurring in 1996; the amended information alleged only six, all occurring between 1994 and 1995. Accordingly, the amended information related back to the original information and must be deemed timely. <em>(Harris v. Superior Court </em>(1988) 201 Cal.App.3d 624, 627-628 [247 Cal.Rptr. 620]; see Pen. Code, \u00a7 803, subd. (b) [\u201cNo time during which prosecution of the same person for the same conduct is pending in a court of this state is a part of a limitation of time prescribed in this chapter.\u201d], in effect since at least 1985, added by Stats. 1984, ch. 1270, \u00a7 2, p. 4335.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1207-7\">Ortega accuses us of trying to have it both ways. If, as we conclude, all six counts charged in the amended information actually occurred in 1995, then he might accept arguendo that three counts can relate back to the three 1995 counts alleged in the original information, but he argues that the <em>other </em>three counts <em>cannot </em>relate back to the three <em>1994 </em>counts alleged in the original information because they are not the \u201csame conduct.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1207-8\">The original information and the amended information, however, both alleged all dates of commission using the words \u201con or about.\u201d Lewd acts that allegedly occurred \u201con or about\u201d 1994 (according to the original information) can be the same conduct as lewd acts that allegedly occurred \u201con or about\u201d 1994 to 1995 (according to the amended information). In any event, it has been held that, if the prosecution amends to correct a date, that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1430\">*1430</page-number>will not prevent the amended pleading from relating back to the original: \u201cThe amendment of an information in a criminal case by merely changing the alleged date of the offense charged, as was done in this case, like any other amended pleading, relates back to the date of the original filing of the information, and has the effect of tolling the running of the statute of limitations from the date of the filing of the original information. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(In re Davis </em>(1936) 13 Cal.App.2d 109, 113-114 [56 P.2d 302].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1208-5\">In arguing that three counts of the amended information do not relate back, defendant relies on <em>People v. Terry </em>(2005) 127 Cal.App.4th 750 [26 Cal.Rptr.3d 71]. <em>Terry, </em>however, involved an original pleading that alleged (as relevant here) one lewd act count and amended pleadings that replaced it with six lewd act counts in the same timeframe. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 757.) The court held that the amended pleadings did not allege the \u201c \u2018same conduct\u2019 \u201d as the original pleading and therefore did not relate back. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 767-768.) Here, the number of counts did not change; all that changed were their alleged dates. As already discussed, a mere date change does not prevent an amended pleading from relating back.</p>\n<p id=\"b1208-6\">[[Image here]]</p>\n<p id=\"b1208-7\">So far, our analysis is based on the premise that the offenses were committed in 1995. Defendant understandably attacks this premise. He points out that Jane\u2019s testimony was \u201cgeneric\u201d in the sense that she could not specify the date (or any other distinguishing characteristics) of any particular violation. Although the jury was given a unanimity instruction (CALCRIM No. 3501), defendant claims it is impossible to tell whether the jurors agreed unanimously that all six counts were committed in 1995; they may have found that some or all of them were committed in 1994.</p>\n<p id=\"b1209-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1431\">*1431</page-number>This is precisely the type of factual issue that defendant forfeited by not requesting that the jury be instructed on the statute of limitations. If it had been so instructed, it could and would have made the assertedly omitted finding. Under <em>Williams, </em>in light of defendant\u2019s forfeiture, our task is to determine whether the record shows, as a matter of law, that a prosecution of defendant for six violations of Penal Code section 288, subdivision (a) allegedly committed between January 1994 and November 1995 is timely. Because the record shows that defendant violated Penal Code section 288, subdivision (a) at least 48 times between January 1994 and November 1995, we may conclude that the prosecution was timely as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b1209-5\">In so holding, we are merely following <em>People </em>v. <em>Smith </em>(2002) 98 Cal.App.4th 1182 [120 Cal.Rptr.2d 185]. There, the victim testified that three types of molestations\u2014\u201cbuttock fondlings,\u201d \u201cplayful spankings,\u201d and \u201cviolent spankings\u201d\u2014occurred \u201cregularly,\u201d \u201chundreds of [times] over a seven-year period.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1189.) The defendant was charged with 17 violations of Penal Code section 288 or 288.5\u2014count 1, allegedly committed in 1989 or 1990; count 2, allegedly committed in 1990 or 1991; and counts 3 through 17, each allegedly committed between 1991 and 1996. <em>(Smith, supra, </em>at pp. 1185-1186.) To be timely under the basic six-year limitations period, each count had to have been committed on or after October 26, 1992. However, under an alternative statute of limitations, they would be timely as long as the defendant had committed at least one additional violation of Penal Code section 288 or 288.5 against the same victim within the basic six-year limitation period. <em>(Smith, supra, </em>at pp. 1186, 1188, 1191.) The jury was not required to make any findings regarding the statute of limitations. (See <em>id. </em>at p. 1187.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1209-6\">The appellate court \u201cconcluded] that we can evaluate whether the record demonstrates that defendant committed at least one violation of section 288 within the [basic six-year] limitation period without determining which acts the jury relied upon to convict defendant of violating . . . section 288 <em>(People v. Smith, supra, </em>98 Cal.App.4th at p. 1188.) It explained: \u201cHere, the trial evidence allowed for only two possible conclusions, namely, that all the section 288 molestations identified by [the v]ictim had occurred or none had occurred. ... At trial, defendant presented the same defense to each described act, namely, that he may have committed it but that he lacked the requisite sexual intent when he did so. Defendant did not seriously dispute that the acts occurred over the period identified by [the v]ictim. After reviewing the available record, we conclude that it contains overwhelming evidence that defendant <em>committed </em>all of the hundreds of acts described by [the v]ictim with the requisite intent, including the multitude of described acts which occurred regularly between October ... 26, 1992, and April 20, 1996.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 1189-1190.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1210-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1432\">*1432</page-number>Here, identically, the evidence presented the jury with an all-or-nothing proposition\u2014between 1992 or 1993 and January 1996, defendant committed lewd acts at least weekly, or not at all. It afforded no basis for a finding that he committed lewd acts in 1994, but not in 1995. If the jury had been instructed to determine, for purposes of the statute of limitations, whether defendant committed lewd acts at least six times in 1995, it would have found that he did.\"</p>\n<p id=\"b1210-5\">Defendant relies on <em>People </em>v. <em>Angel </em>(1999) 70 Cal.App.4th 1141 [83 Cal.Rptr.2d 222]. There, the victim testified that, when she was between seven and 16 (i.e., roughly between 1982 and 1991), the defendant molested her \u201con numerous occasions\u201d and at least once a month. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 1143-1144.) The defendant was charged with multiple sex offenses against a child, including two counts allegedly committed in July 1989. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 1143, 1145.) These counts were timely if, and only if, the underlying acts were committed on or after July 20, 1989. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1146.) The jury was not instructed on the statute of limitations. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1145.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1210-6\">The appellate court reversed the conviction on these two counts. It stated: \u201cThe People must plead and prove, by a preponderance of the evidence, that prosecution commenced within the statutorily prescribed time period. [Citations.] Here, given [the victim]\u2019s testimony that appellant committed numerous acts within the time alleged in counts 17 and 18, the offenses charged therein could have occurred before or after the limitations period expired. The prosecution never proved the offenses could only have occurred within the applicable period; moreover, although jurors were instructed that they had to agree on the act(s) constituting the offense, they were never instructed on the statute of limitations. Absent such an instruction, the equivocal proof failed to overcome the prosecution\u2019s burden. [Citation.] Since we cannot tell whether the jury convicted appellant of offenses not shown to have been committed within the period of limitations, the convictions are fatally defective unless the statute of limitations was tolled. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Angel, supra, </em>70 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1146-1147, fn. omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1210-7\"><em>Angel </em>is distinguishable because it appears that there the victim\u2019s testimony would not have supported a finding that any molestation occurred specifically between July 20 and 31, 1989. Somewhat to the contrary, she testified that the defendant was molesting her at least once a month; thus, it was possible that he molested her only once in July 1989, sometime earlier than July 20. Here, by contrast, Jane testified that defendant was molesting her at least weekly; this necessarily means that he did molest her at least six times in 1995.</p>\n<p id=\"b1210-8\">In <em>Smith, </em>the court noted that its holding was in tension with <em>Angel, </em>but it added: \u201cTo the extent the <em>Angel </em>decision contradicts our analysis or conclusions, we respectfully disagree with it.\u201d <em>(People v. Smith, supra, </em>98 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1433\">*1433</page-number>Cal.App.4th at p. 1192.) <em>Smith </em>also noted that <em>Angel </em>was decided several months before Williams; thus, \u201cthe <em>Angel </em>court did not have the benefit of the analysis and holding of the pertinent Supreme Court case . . . .\u201d <em>(Smith, supra, </em>at p. 1192.) For all these reasons, we conclude that <em>Smith, </em>rather than <em>Angel, </em>is controlling here.</p>\n<p id=\"b1211-5\">Incidentally, the People appear to be somewhat confused about when the offenses should be deemed to have been committed. They state: \u201cThe acts at issue . . . started in January 1994 and continued until November 1995. The statute of limitations thus commenced to run on the earliest of those dates.\u201d Actually, the amended information alleged, and the jury found, that the acts took place between January 1994 and November 1995; however, the evidence showed they took place at least weekly between 1992 or 1993 and January 1996. The issue before us is not whether the accusatory pleading adequately alleged that the prosecution was timely. If it was, we would agree that a crime allegedly committed just once, sometime between January 1994 and November 1995, must be deemed to have been committed on the earliest of these dates. However, we are assuming that the information was defective. Hence, the issue is whether the record as a whole establishes that the prosecution was timely. Thus, we may look beyond the allegations of the information.</p>\n<p id=\"b1211-6\">Given this confusion, the People do not rely on the alternative 10-year limitations period. Rather, they rely on yet another limitations period\u2014Penal Code section 803, former subdivision (f) (in effect since at least Jan. 1, 1994, as Pen. Code, \u00a7 803, former subd. (g), as amended by Stats. 1993, ch. 390, \u00a7 1, pp. 2224-2226, renumbered as Pen. Code, \u00a7 803, subd. (f) by Stats. 2005, ch. 479, \u00a7 3, p. 3791), which provides that, under certain circumstances, \u201ca criminal complaint may be filed within one year of the date of a report to a California law enforcement agency by a person of any age alleging that he or she, while under the age of 18 years, was the victim of a crime described in Section . . . 288 . . . .\u201d In light of our conclusions, we need not consider the applicability of this limitations period.</p>\n<p id=\"b1211-7\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b1211-8\">FAILURE TO INSTRUCT THE RECONSTITUTED JURY TO START ITS DELIBERATIONS ANEW<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1212-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1434\">*1434</page-number>IV</p>\n<p id=\"b1212-5\">DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b1212-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1212-7\">Hollenhorst, Acting P.
