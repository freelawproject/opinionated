The court granted the motion and a tax accountant was employed. After completing the work, the accountant made application for the payment of his fees. By that time, the bankruptcy judge had decided that a liquidating trustee under a Chapter 7 bankruptcy was not required to pay income taxes. He, therefore, denied the request. On appeal, the district court affirmed the bankruptcy judge\u2019s order. The district court relied on <em>In re Holywell Corp., </em>911 F.2d 1539 (11th Cir.1990), for its decision that a liquidating trustee under a Chapter 7 proceeding was not required to pay income taxes.</p>\n<p id=\"b1301-12\">In <em>Holywell, </em>we held that such a liquidating trustee was not required to pay income taxes. In making that determination, we construed Section 6012 of the Internal Revenue Code, which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1301-13\">Persons required to make returns of income</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1301-14\">(b)(3) In a case where a receiver, trustee in a case under title 11 of the United States Code, or assignee, by order of a court of competent jurisdiction, by operation of law or otherwise, has possession of or holds title to all or substantially all of the property or business of a corporation, whether or not such property or business is being operated, such receiver, trustee, or assignee shall make the return of income for such corporation in the same manner and form as corporations are required to make such returns.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1301-15\">26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6012(b)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b1301-16\">Appellant now points out that <em>Holywell </em>has been reversed by the Supreme Court. <em>See Holywell v. Stanton Smith, </em>- U.S. -, 112 S.Ct. 1021, 117 L.Ed.2d 196 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b1301-19\">It is therefore clear now that the bankruptcy judge\u2019s original determination that he had authority to appoint the accountant was correct. Although the appellee has filed no brief in this appeal, we do not need such a brief to point out to us that we must now reverse the trial court\u2019s decision and remand the case for further proceedings in the bankruptcy court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1301-20\">REMANDED for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
