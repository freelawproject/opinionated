BROWN, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b1465-23\">Horace Albert Knight filed a complaint in district court against Houston police officers, Michael Walker and Allen Tharling, alleging violations of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1983 and 1985. Knight claimed that while he was in police custody, officers Walker and Thar-ling assaulted him and threatened to kill him. Following a jury verdict in favor of the officers, the trial court entered judgment on their behalf. Knight now appeals this judgment pro se, complaining solely of defects in the court\u2019s jury charge. Because we find no error in the court\u2019s charge, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1465-24\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1465-25\">(a) <em>Failure to Order Transcript</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1465-26\">Initially, the record before us consisted only of four volumes of the clerk\u2019s documentary record and the trial exhibits, and lacked the verbatim transcription of the court reporter\u2019s notes of the trial proceedings. Because Knight\u2019s arguments on appeal are directed at the court\u2019s charge, a transcript of the trial proceedings was necessary in order to determine whether Knight properly objected to the charge.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Because of the serious nature of Knight\u2019s claims, we ordered that the transcript of the parties\u2019 jury charge conference be produced at the Government\u2019s expense pursu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1432\">*1432</page-number>ant to our authority under 28 U.S.C. 753(f), in order to determine whether Knight made the proper objections to the court\u2019s charge.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1466-4\">The record reveals that at the charge conference, Knight failed to make any objections of this nature to the court\u2019s proposed charge. Thus, we review the court\u2019s charge for plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b1466-5\">(b) <em>No Plain Error</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1466-6\">When reviewing for plain error, this court asks whether the trial court committed an error which resulted in a \u201cmanifest miscarriage of justice.\u201d <em>Coughlin v. Capitol Cement Co., </em>571 F.2d 290, 297 (5th Cir.1978). We hold that the court\u2019s charge adequately reflected the applicable law and did , not result in injustice.</p>\n<p id=\"b1466-7\">The first interrogatory of the court\u2019s charge inquired, \u201cWas Knight injured in October of 1978 during the arrest or while in custody?\u201d The jury answered \u201cno\u201d and therefore was instructed to go no further with the charge. Knight argues that the interrogatory concerning \u201cinjury\u201d should not have been asked until the \u201cdamages section\u201d of the charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b1466-8\">Until very recently, the law in this circuit required a person to prove that he or she incurred a significant injury in order to. prevail on a section 1983 excessive force claim. <em>See Johnson v. Morel, </em>876 F.2d 477 (5th Cir.1989).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> However, in <em>Hudson v. McMillian, </em>503 U.S. -, 112 S.Ct. 995, 117 L.Ed.2d 156 (1992), the Supreme Court overturned the Fifth Circuit\u2019s \u201csignificant injury\u201d requirement.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1466-17\">Citing the Whitley<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> approach, the Supreme Court in <em>Hudson </em>held that \u201cthe extent of injury suffered by an inmate is one factor that may suggest \u2018whether the use of force could plausibly have been thought necessary\u2019 in a particular situation.\u201d <em>Hudson, </em>503 U.S. at -, 112 S.Ct. at 999, 117 L.Ed.2d at 166 (quoting <em>Whitley, </em>475 U.S. at 321, 106 S.Ct. at 1085). Moreover, the Court reasoned that contemporary standards of decency are always violated when prison officials maliciously and sadistically use force to cause harm, regardless of whether significant injury is present. <em>Id. </em>503 U.S. at -, 112 S.Ct. at 1000, 117 L.Ed.2d at 167. In the end, the court reversed our holding, stating that \u201c[t]he extent of Hudson\u2019s injuries provides no basis for dismissal of his \u00a7 1983 claim.\u201d <em>Id. </em>503 U.S. at -, 112 S.Ct. at 1000, 117 L.Ed.2d at 168.</p>\n<p id=\"b1466-23\">The Supreme Court\u2019s decision makes clear that we can no longer require persons to prove \u201csignificant injury,\u201d as we had used that term for years, under section 1983. The Court\u2019s holding, however, does not affect the rule that requires proof of injury, albeit significant or insignificant. In fact, the Supreme Court specifically denied constitutional protection for <em>\u201cde min-imis </em>uses of physical force, provided that the use of force is not of a sort repugnant to the conscience of mankind.\u201d <em>Hudson, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1433\">*1433</page-number>503 U.S. at -, 112 S.Ct. at 1000, 117 L.Ed.2d at 167-68 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1467-5\">In Knight\u2019s case, the trial court\u2019s charge asked the jury, \u201cWas Knight <em>injured </em>in October of 1978 during the arrest or while in custody?\u201d The charge subsequently defined injury as \u201cdamage or harm to the physical structure of the body, including diseases that naturally result from the harm.\u201d The trial court did not in any way suggest to the jury that the law required Knight to be significantly or seriously injured. Thus, we hold that the court\u2019s interrogatory and definition is consistent with the analysis set forth in Hudson.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1467-6\">With respect to Knight\u2019s complaint that the court improperly set forth its interrogatories in the wrong order, we hold that the court reasonably constructed its charge. We find no fault with the court requiring the jury to first clear the \u201cinjury\u201d hurdle before it reached questions on damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b1467-7\">Lastly, Knight complains that the court failed to give certain instructions and to define in its charge certain concepts, including \u201ccolor of law,\u201d \u201cunreasonable force,\u201d \u201cdenial of medical attention,\u201d \u201cconspiracy,\u201d \u201cjoint tortfeasors\u201d and \u201cmunicipal liability.\u201d Even Knight's proposed jury instructions as contained in the Joint Pretrial Order failed to request these definitions and instructions. The record does not indicate that Knight later requested these instructions. This fact alone bars Knight from arguing this issue now on appeal. <em>See </em>F.R.Civ.P. 51, <em>infra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1467-8\">Moreover, once the jury answered \u201cno\u201d to the \u201cinjury\u201d question, it could go no further with the other questions in the charge. Because the jury never reached the later interrogatories involving these terms and instructions, they could not have affected the outcome, even if properly requested.</p>\n<p id=\"b1467-14\">Lastly, we find that the charge sufficiently explained all of the above terms to the jury with the exception of \u201cmunicipal liability\u201d and \u201cdenial of medical attention.\u201d The trial court correctly omitted these definitions since 1) the City of Houston earlier was dismissed from the case; and 2) Knight failed to allege in his complaint a denial of medical attention.</p>\n<p id=\"b1467-15\">Accordingly, we uphold the trial court\u2019s judgment entered on behalf of police officers Walker and Tharling.</p>\n<p id=\"b1467-16\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1465-15\">. F.R.Civ.P. 51 provides in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1465-16\">At the close of all the evidence or at such earlier time during the trial as the court reasonably directs, any party may file written requests that the court instruct the jury on the law as set forth in the requests.... No party may assign as error the giving or the failure to give an instruction unless that party objects thereto before the jury retires to consider its verdict, stating distinctly the matter objected to and the grounds of the objection.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1466-11\">. Ordinarily, this court will not entertain an appeal when an appellant does not appeal from the order refusing a transcript at government expense. Although we have strayed from the beaten path in this respect, we do not mean to say that a court should or be required to mimic the course of action taken by this court today.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1466-12\">. <em>Johnson v. Morel </em>is representative of the Fifth Circuit\u2019s long-established mandate that a plaintiff may prevail on a constitutional excessive force claim only by proving each of the following three elements:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1466-13\">(1) a significant injury, which</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1466-14\">(2) resulted directly and only from the use of force that was clearly excessive to the need; and the excessiveness of which was</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1466-15\">(3) objectively reasonable.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1466-24\">. Hudson, a Louisiana prison inmate, filed suit under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, claiming that prison guards beat him causing him to suffer minor bruises, facial swelling, loosened teeth and a cracked dental plate. We reversed the Magistrate\u2019s award in favor of Hudson, stating that Hudson could not prevail because his injuries were \u201cminor.\u2019\u2019</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1466-25\">. <em>Whitley v. Albers, </em>475 U.S. 312, 106 S.Ct. 1078, 89 L.Ed.2d 251 (1986). In <em>Whitley, </em>an inmate brought an Eighth Amendment claim after he was shot by a guard during a prison riot. The Court held that the correct legal standard is \"\u2019whether force was applied in a good faith effort to maintain or restore discipline, or maliciously and sadistically for the very purpose of causing harm.' \u2019\u2019 <em>Id. </em>at 320-21, 106 S.Ct. at 1085 (citations omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1467-9\">. Our decision might be different if the jury would have responded \"yes\u201d to the first question about whether Knight had been injured, and if it would have continued with the charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b1467-10\">Later in the court\u2019s charge, unreasonable seizure is defined as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1467-11\">An arrest otherwise valid is an unreasonable seizure if the arresting officer uses unnecessary force in the arrest or later custody, needlessly injuring or endangering the person he is arresting. Walker and Tharling\u2019s seizure of Knight was unreasonable if:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1467-12\">(a) Knight suffered a <em>significant injury, </em>which</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1467-28\">(b) Resulted directly from Walker or Thar-ling\u2019s clearly excessive use of force.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AHn\">(Emphasis added.) The court also states in explaining excessive.force, \"No officer may inflict, or recklessly risk inflicting, <em>serious injury </em>on a person to arrest him unless the person is an immediate danger to the officer of others.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1467-29\">Because the jury never reached this portion of the special interrogatories, however, we need not decide today whether these instructions violate the Supreme Court\u2019s mandate in <em>Hudson.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
