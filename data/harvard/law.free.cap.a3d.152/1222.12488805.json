The plaintiff contends that the trial court improperly interpreted \u00a7 2-47A to mandate disbarment only if an attorney appropriates client funds knowingly and with the wrongful intent to steal them. Regardless of the defendant's intent, the plaintiff claims, the defendant's knowledge that the funds he appropriated were disputed is sufficient to disbar him. We conclude that \u00a7 2-47A mandates disbarment only when an attorney misappropriates a client's funds both knowingly and intentionally-that is, when an attorney steals from his or her client. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the Appellate Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   This disciplinary action originates from a twelve year old fee dispute that resulted in several actions and various appeals.

Further, the defendant testified that he believed he was entitled to the funds because Yuille did not pursue a counterclaim or intervening complaint sufficient to entitle her to affirmative relief in the breach of contract action, and her special defense similarly did not entitle her to affirmative relief. Accordingly, the defendant claimed that because he believed Yuille had no interest in the funds other than to pay Mooney, he was entitled to the funds and he was therefore justified in having them moved to his personal account. Notwithstanding the defendant's testimony regarding his subjective belief as to his entitlement to the funds, the plaintiff argued that the defendant violated rule 1.15 (f) of the Rules of Professional Conduct and also was subject to mandatory disbarment because he knowingly misappropriated client funds in violation of Practice Book \u00a7 2-47A.

Specifically, the trial court found that the defendant's \"failure to escrow the funds ... was not a reflection of any lack of integrity on his part and that he did not act wilfully or with intent to deceive Yuille.\" Essentially, while the defendant appropriated the funds knowingly, he had \"engaged in this conduct negligently,\" without deceptive intent. The trial court \"set forth the protracted, lengthy, very confusing, and tortured history of the fee dispute,\" and found that the defendant's mistaken belief that Yuille had no personal interest in the funds other than to pay Mooney, meant \"the defendant acted unreasonably but not dishonestly, and without an intent to deceive.\"\n   <em>\n    Disciplinary Counsel\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Parnoff\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=158%20Conn.%20App.%20454\">\n    158 Conn.App. at 466\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=119%20A.3d%20621\">\n    119 A.3d 621\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Practice Book \u00a7 2-47A provides: \"In any disciplinary proceeding where there has been a finding by a judge of the superior court that a lawyer has\n   <em>\n    knowingly misappropriated\n   </em>\n   a client's funds or other property held in trust, the discipline for such conduct shall be disbarment for a minimum of twelve years.\" (Emphasis added.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The phrase \"knowingly misappropriated\" is not defined in Practice Book \u00a7 2-47A or elsewhere in the rules of practice. Because the rules of practice do not provide guidance, we look to related provisions. Rule 1.0 (g) of the Rules of Professional Conduct define \" '[k]nowingly' \" as \"denot [ing] actual knowledge of the fact in question.\" We observe that General Statutes \u00a7 53a-3 of the Penal Code also offers guidance. Section 53a-3 (12) provides: \"A person acts 'knowingly' with\n   respect to conduct or to a circumstance described by a statute defining an offense when he is aware that his conduct is of such nature or that such circumstance exists ....\" A person, therefore, acts knowingly when he or she has actual knowledge or awareness of the nature of the act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The term \"misappropriated\" is not defined in the rules of practice or in any related provisions, thus, in accordance with General Statutes \u00a7 1-1 (a), we look to its common usage.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   \"To ascertain that usage, we look to the dictionary definition of the term.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Potvin\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Lincoln Service &amp; Equipment Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4344113\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/298/620/#p633\">\n    298 Conn. 620\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 633,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=6%20A.3d%2060\">\n    6 A.3d 60\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2010). Misappropriate is defined as \"[t]o appropriate\n   <em>\n    wrongly\n   </em>\n   .... To appropriate\n   <em>\n    dishonestly\n   </em>\n   for one's own use; embezzle.... To use illegally.\" (Emphasis added.) American Heritage College Dictionary (4th Ed. 2007) p. 887. It is clear that, because the definition of misappropriate incorporates the concepts of wrongfulness, dishonesty, and embezzlement-all of which generally require intent-the term misappropriate inherently includes an element of intent. Specifically, the term \"misappropriate\" incorporates an intent to wrongfully take the property of another-to steal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The definition of misappropriate is uncannily similar to the definition of larceny in General Statutes \u00a7 53a-119, which provides in relevant part that \"[a] person\n   commits larceny when,\n   <em>\n    with intent\n   </em>\n   to deprive another of property or to appropriate the same to himself or a third person, he\n   <em>\n    wrongfully takes\n   </em>\n   , obtains or withholds such property from an owner. Larceny includes, but is not limited to ...\n   <em>\n    Embezzlement\n   </em>\n   .... Obtaining\n   property by\n   <em>\n    false pretenses\n   </em>\n   ....\n   <em>\n    Theft\n   </em>\n   of services.... Receiving\n   <em>\n    stolen property\n   </em>\n   ....

The commission's comment to \u00a7 53a-119 provides in relevant part that \"[t]his definition ... is meant to encompass the myriad ways in which property may be stolen.\" Commission to Revise the Criminal Statutes, Penal Code Comments, Conn. Gen. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 53a-119 (West 2012), commission comment, p. 108. With respect to the intent element of larceny, the Appellate Court has observed that \"[a] specific intent to deprive or to misappropriate is an essential element of larceny.\"\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Pulley\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"286165\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/46/414/#p418\">\n    46 Conn.App. 414\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 418,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=699%20A.2d%201042\">\n    699 A.2d 1042\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1997).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   By contrast, the term \"appropriate\" is defined as \"[t]o take possession of or make use of exclusively for oneself, often without permission.\" American Heritage College Dictionary, supra, at p. 70. The definition of the term \"appropriate,\" unlike that of \"misappropriate,\" does not include an inherently wrongful or dishonest intent, and certainly is not consistent with the concept of theft. If the drafters of the rules of practice intended to require merely a \"knowing\" mental state, without an element of intent as the plaintiff contends, they would have used the word \"appropriate\" instead of the word \"misappropriate.\" Their decision not to do so is telling. An attorney, therefore, can be said to knowingly misappropriate funds when the attorney: (1) appropriates funds; (2) does so knowing that a client claims to have an interest in them;\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   (3) does so with the intent to steal the funds or otherwise take them wrongfully, dishonestly, or illegally.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   On the basis of the trial court's factual findings, as set forth in this opinion, the defendant's transfer of funds constituted an appropriation that he undertook knowingly. The trial court found, however, that the\n   long and tortuous procedural history of the parties' fee dispute contributed to the defendant's unreasonable but subjective belief that he was entitled to the disputed funds and no longer was required to maintain them in escrow.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Put another way, the defendant appropriated client funds, did so knowingly, but did not do so with any intent to steal the escrowed funds or otherwise take them wrongfully, dishonestly, or illegally. The transfer did not constitute theft or larceny. Accordingly, because the defendant did not intend to steal from his client he did not act with the intent necessary to constitute a misappropriation and, therefore, is not subject to mandatory disbarment pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 2-47A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The plaintiff contends that New Jersey case law should inform our decision in the present case because the 2007 commentary to Practice Book \u00a7 2-47A states that \u00a7 2-47A is \"a codification of the '\n   <em>\n    Wilson\n   </em>\n   rule',\" as set out in\n   <em>\n    In re Wilson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"334908\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj/81/451/\">\n    81 N.J. 451\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=409%20A.2d%201153\">\n    409 A.2d 1153\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1979).\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   In\n   <em>\n    Wilson\n   </em>\n   , the Supreme\n   Court of New Jersey defined \" 'misappropriation' \" as \"any unauthorized use by the lawyer of clients' funds entrusted to him, including not only stealing, but also unauthorized temporary use for the lawyer's own purpose, whether or not he derives any personal gain or benefit therefrom.\" Id., 455,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=409%20A.2d%201153\">\n    409 A.2d 1153\n   </extracted-citation>\n   n.1. Specifically, the plaintiff argues that this definition, and the case law that interpreted it, essentially stand for the \"hard line\" proposition that any time an attorney\n   appropriates client funds, the attorney's subjective belief as to his entitlement to those funds is irrelevant in determining whether the attorney committed a knowing misappropriation. The Appellate Court agreed with the plaintiff's assertion that\n   <em>\n    Wilson\n   </em>\n   and its progeny are instructive in interpreting \u00a7 2-47A, but distinguished them from the present case because those cases concerned the related but distinct question of whether an attorney's subjective intent to merely borrow client funds is a mitigating factor in determining when mandatory disbarment is proper.\n   <em>\n    Disciplinary Counsel\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Parnoff\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=158%20Conn.%20App.%20454\">\n    158 Conn.App. at 470-73\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=119%20A.3d%20621\">\n    119 A.3d 621\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   In holding that in order to be subject to mandatory disbarment pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 2-47A, an attorney must knowingly and intentionally steal client funds, we reject the definition of \"knowing misappropriation\" from\n   <em>\n    Wilson\n   </em>\n   , which resembles strict liability, and the New Jersey case law that flows from it.\n   <em>\n    In re Wilson\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"334908\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj/81/451/\">\n    81 N.J. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   455 n.1,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=409%20A.2d%201153\">\n    409 A.2d 1153\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In addition to being inharmonious with our statutory construction of \"knowingly misappropriated,\" such a standard would impose a severe punishment-that of mandatory disbarment for a minimum of twelve years-on attorneys for conduct that had been undertaken less than intentionally and, further, would create a rigid rule, robbing the trial court of its discretion to fashion sanctions properly suited to the offending attorney's background, intent, and mitigating or aggravating circumstances.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The judgment of the Appellate Court is affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   In this opinion the other justices concurred.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-38\">\n    Practice Book \u00a7 2-47A provides: \"In any disciplinary proceeding where there has been a finding by a judge of the superior court that a lawyer has knowingly misappropriated a client's funds or other property held in trust, the discipline for such conduct shall be disbarment for a minimum of twelve years.\"\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-39\">\n    Although Practice Book \u00a7 2-47A has been amended since the events underlying this appeal by the addition of the phrase \"for a minimum of twelve years\" after the word \"disbarment,\" that amendment has no bearing on the merits of this appeal.
