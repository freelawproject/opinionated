Petitioner Richmond Phillips argues that the DNA evidence is not admissible because the analysis was not performed in accordance with standards established by one of the two entities named in CJP \u00a7 10-915 (\"DNA Admissibility Statute\"), and because the methods of analysis that were used are not generally accepted as reliable in the relevant scientific community under\n   <em>\n    Frye\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    -\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Reed\n   </em>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The trial court and the Court of Special Appeals\n   agreed with Mr. Phillips that the DNA evidence did not qualify for\n   automatic admissibility under \u00a7 10-915, but held that the evidence was nonetheless admissible under\n   <em>\n    Frye\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    -\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Reed\n   </em>\n   . Mr. Phillips now challenges the latter conclusion, while the State challenges the former.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   For the reasons that follow, we hold that the DNA evidence was automatically admissible under CJP \u00a7 10-915. Accordingly, the trial court should not have conducted a\n   <em>\n    Frye\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    -\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Reed\n   </em>\n   hearing to determine its admissibility, and we will not address Mr. Phillips' contention that the trial court's ruling at that hearing was erroneous.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The State charged Mr. Phillips with the first-degree murders of his ex-girlfriend, Wynetta Wright, and their eleven-month-old daughter, Jaylin Wright, which took place on May 31, 2011. Wynetta died of a gunshot wound to the head. Her body was found in a park near the Hillcrest Heights Community Center in Prince George's County. Jaylin died of hyperthermia as a result of being left in a hot vehicle for an extended period of time. Her body was found in Wynetta's car in a parking lot near the park. Mr. Phillips admitted to meeting with Wynetta in the park in the early morning hours of May 31, but denied any involvement in her death or Jaylin's death.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The police obtained DNA samples from the crime scenes, the victims, and Mr. Phillips, which were tested in June 2011 by forensic chemist Jessica Charak of the Prince George's County Police Department Crime Laboratory (\"Prince George's County Laboratory\" or \"Laboratory\"). Two samples are relevant to this appeal: a buccal swab\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   from Mr. Phillips,\n   and a sample obtained from the steering wheel of Wynetta's car. Based on Ms. Charak's analysis, she concluded that the steering wheel sample was consistent with Mr. Phillips' DNA profile and, therefore, he could not be excluded as a contributor to the sample. Ms. Charak found that the steering wheel sample also contained genetic material from Wynetta, Jaylin, and at least two additional unknown contributors. Ms. Charak calculated that \"[t]he chances of selecting an unrelated individual from the random population who would be included as a possible contributor to the mixed DNA profile obtained from the evidence sample ... are approximately ... 1 in 2.93 million individuals in the African American population.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Prior to trial, Mr. Phillips filed a motion\n   <em>\n    in limine\n   </em>\n   to exclude the State's DNA evidence and related expert testimony. Mr. Phillips argued that the Prince George's County Laboratory's methods of analyzing complex, low-template DNA\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   samples were not generally accepted as reliable in the relevant scientific community, and thus the evidence was inadmissible under\n   <em>\n    Frye\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    -\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Reed\n   </em>\n   . The State responded that the DNA evidence and related expert testimony were automatically admissible under CJP \u00a7 10-915, and thus a\n   <em>\n    Frye\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    -\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Reed\n   </em>\n   hearing was not necessary to determine admissibility.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The DNA Admissibility Statute in effect throughout Mr. Phillips' proceedings provided that DNA evidence \"is admissible to prove or disprove the identity of any person,\" so long as certain conditions are fulfilled:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   (a)\n   <em>\n    Definitions.\n   </em>\n   -\n   (1) In this section the following words have the meanings indicated.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   (2) \"Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA)\" means the molecules in all cellular forms that contain genetic information in a chemical structure of each individual.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   (3) \"DNA profile\" means an analysis of genetic loci that have [sic] been validated according to standards established by:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   (i) The Technical Working Group on DNA Analysis Methods (TWGDAM); or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   (ii) The DNA Advisory Board of the Federal Bureau of Investigation.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   (b)\n   <em>\n    In general.\n   </em>\n   -\n   <strong>\n    A statement from the testing laboratory setting forth that the analysis of genetic loci has been validated by standards established by TWGDAM or the DNA Advisory Board\n   </strong>\n   is sufficient to admit a DNA profile under this section.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   (c)\n   <em>\n    Purposes.\n   </em>\n   -In any criminal proceeding, the evidence of a DNA profile is admissible to prove or disprove the identity of any person, if the party seeking to introduce the evidence of a DNA profile [complies with specified notice requirements].\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   CJP \u00a7 10-915 (1998) (emphasis added) (amended 2016). Ms. Charak's report contained the following statement of validation: \"The DNA profiles reported below were determined by procedures which have been\n   <strong>\n    validated according to the Federal Bureau of Investigation's Quality Assurance Standards\n   </strong>\n   for Forensic DNA Testing Laboratories.\" (Emphasis added.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The trial court conducted two hearings to determine the admissibility of the DNA evidence. First, the trial court held a hearing to determine whether the Prince George's County Laboratory was in compliance with the DNA Admissibility Statute, which would render the evidence automatically admissible without the need for a\n   <em>\n    Frye\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    -\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Reed\n   </em>\n   hearing. At this initial hearing, the trial court determined that the Laboratory was not in compliance with the Statute, and therefore the DNA\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   evidence was not automatically admissible. Next, the trial court conducted a\n   <em>\n    Frye\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    -\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Reed\n   </em>\n   hearing to determine whether the Laboratory's methods of analysis were generally accepted as reliable within the relevant scientific community. The trial court concluded that the Laboratory's methods satisfied this standard, and therefore the DNA evidence would be admissible at trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Mr. Phillips was tried before a jury beginning on January 14, 2013. The trial court admitted into evidence the analysis of the buccal swab and steering wheel sample, and Ms. Charak testified regarding her conclusions. On January 17, 2013, the jury convicted Mr. Phillips of the first-degree murders of Wynetta and Jaylin, and related charges. On March 22, 2013, the trial court sentenced Mr. Phillips to two consecutive terms of life imprisonment without the possibility of parole. Mr. Phillips appealed, and the Court of Special Appeals affirmed the convictions.\n   <em>\n    Phillips v.

Here, a relevant statute exists-the DNA Admissibility Statute, CJP \u00a7 10-915. The DNA Admissibility Statute provides that DNA evidence is admissible so long as certain notice requirements are met and the analysis is accompanied by \"[a] statement from the testing laboratory setting forth that the analysis\n   of genetic loci has been validated by standards established by TWGDAM or the DNA Advisory Board.\" CJP \u00a7 10-915 (1998) (amended 2016). \"When the General Assembly has enacted legislation rendering evidence admissible, 'the only way to contest the validity of the underlying principles involved would be to argue that the statutes violate one's right to due process of law.' \"\n   <em>\n    Armstead\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1999239\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/342/38/#p54\">\n    342 Md. at 57\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1999239\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/342/38/#p54\">\n    673 A.2d 221\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting L.

Mr. Phillips has not argued before this Court that the DNA Admissibility Statute violates his right to due process.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thus, if the DNA evidence offered by the State at Mr. Phillips' trial satisfied the requirements of \u00a7 10-915, then Mr. Phillips was not entitled to a\n   <em>\n    Frye\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    -\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Reed\n   </em>\n   hearing to determine its admissibility.

The Parties' Contentions and Lower Courts' Rulings\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Mr. Phillips argues that the DNA evidence was not automatically admissible under CJP \u00a7 10-915 because Ms. Charak's report was not accompanied by a statement that the\n   analysis had \"been validated by standards established by TWGDAM or the DNA Advisory Board,\" as required by the Statute. Instead, the report was accompanied by a statement that the Prince George's County Laboratory's procedures had \"been validated according to the Federal Bureau of Investigation's Quality Assurance Standards for Forensic DNA Testing Laboratories.\" Mr. Phillips asserts that this statement of validation is not sufficient for automatic admissibility under the Statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The State responds that the DNA evidence was automatically admissible under CJP \u00a7 10-915 because Maryland law requires state forensics laboratories to adhere to the QAS for DNA testing.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Md. Code, Pub. Safety \u00a7 2-503(b) (requiring state laboratories to comply with federal standards for inclusion in the Combined DNA Index System). The two entities named in the Statute no longer exist, and the QAS are now the relevant standards. Therefore, the State asserts, a statement of validation that the Prince George's County Laboratory's procedures had been validated according to the QAS should be sufficient for automatic admissibility under CJP \u00a7 10-915.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The trial court agreed with Mr. Phillips that the Prince George's County Laboratory's statement of validation was not sufficient for automatic admissibility under the Statute. Because TWGDAM and the DNA Advisory Board were no longer in existence at the time the Laboratory performed its analysis, the court found that TWGDAM's successor, \"SWGDAM[,] is now the entity that sets forth the standards for DNA testing.\" The trial court then interpreted the Statute by \"substituting\" SWGDAM for TWGDAM, and held that compliance with SWGDAM guidelines was required for automatic admissibility under CJP \u00a7 10-915. The court found that SWGDAM had guidelines for interpreting\n   complex DNA mixtures, which the Laboratory did not follow when it performed its analysis. Thus, the trial court held that the Laboratory's compliance with the QAS was not sufficient for automatic admissibility under CJP \u00a7 10-915, and proceeded to conduct a\n   <em>\n    Frye\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    -\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Reed\n   </em>\n   hearing to determine whether the DNA evidence\n   could be admitted at trial. The trial court ultimately determined that the DNA evidence was admissible under\n   <em>\n    Frye\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    -\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Reed\n   </em>\n   , and the State introduced Ms. Charak's report and testimony at trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Before the Court of Special Appeals, Mr. Phillips asserted that the trial court's ruling on the State's noncompliance with \u00a7 10-915 was correct, but challenged the trial court's ruling on admissibility under\n   <em>\n    Frye\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    -\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Reed\n   </em>\n   . In response, the State erroneously asserted that the trial court had found that the Prince George's County Laboratory's statement of validation was sufficient under the Statute, and therefore the court was precluded from even holding a\n   <em>\n    Frye\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    -\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Reed\n   </em>\n   hearing to determine the admissibility of the DNA evidence. Neither party explicitly addressed how the appellate court should interpret \u00a7 10-915 in light of the fact that the two entities named in the Statute no longer exist.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The Court of Special Appeals framed the issue as \"decid[ing] what to do with a statute that appears to be obsolete.\"\n   <em>\n    Phillips\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4031052\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md-app/226/1/#p4\">\n    226 Md.App. at 3\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4031052\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md-app/226/1/#p4\">\n    126 A.3d 739\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Mr. Phillips argues that this Court need not decide whether the Court of Special Appeals' interpretation of \u00a7 10-915 is correct, because the version of the Statute that that court interpreted is no longer in effect. During the 2016 Legislative Session, the General Assembly passed an amendment to CJP \u00a7 10-915 so that the Statute now references the QAS, in addition to TWGDAM and the DNA Advisory Board, as providing the DNA testing standards that must be followed for automatic admissibility.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   2016 Md.

The State maintains that its cross-petition is not moot because there is still an existing controversy between the parties-namely, whether the State's DNA evidence was\n   automatically admissible at Mr. Phillips' trial under the previous version of \u00a7 10-915.

The controversy is whether the DNA evidence qualified for automatic admissibility at Mr. Phillips' trial pursuant to the previous version of \u00a7 10-915. Because \u00a7 10-915 was recently amended to make explicit that compliance with the QAS is sufficient for automatic admissibility, the parties' dispute over whether the Prince George's County Laboratory's compliance with the QAS was sufficient in this case would already be resolved if the offense had been committed on or after October 1, 2016. However, because the 2016 amendments to the Statute apply only prospectively, we still must determine whether the Laboratory complied with the previous version of the Statute, which was in effect at all times relevant to this proceeding: when the charged offenses occurred, when the Laboratory performed its analysis, during the pre-\n   <em>\n    Frye\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    -\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Reed\n   </em>\n   hearing, and during Mr. Phillips' trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Additionally, this Court can fashion an effective remedy by deciding the proper interpretation of the previous version of the Statute, and either affirming Mr. Phillips' convictions or reversing them and remanding the case for a new trial (if we were to also decide that the DNA evidence was not otherwise admissible, and that any error in admitting it was not harmless).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Because there is still an existing controversy between the parties, and the Court can fashion an effective remedy, we hold that the State's cross-petition, regarding the proper interpretation of \u00a7 10-915 before it was amended in 2016, is not moot. Accordingly, Mr. Phillips' motion to dismiss the State's cross-petition as moot is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     C.

In fact, Mr. Phillips asserts, the Laboratory's analysis could not possibly include such a statement because neither TWGDAM nor the DNA Advisory Board were in existence when the Laboratory performed its analysis in June 2011. The State counters that since TWGDAM and the DNA Advisory Board went defunct, state and federal law have required forensics laboratories to adhere to the QAS. Therefore, the State concludes, although the DNA Admissibility Statute does not explicitly mention the QAS, the Laboratory's compliance with those standards should be deemed sufficient for automatic admissibility of the DNA evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   The trial court found as a matter of fact, and the Court of Special Appeals agreed, that TWGDAM and the DNA Advisory Board were no longer in existence when the Prince George's County Laboratory performed its analysis in June 2011.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Phillips\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4031052\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md-app/226/1/#p4\">\n    226 Md.App. at 8, 15\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4031052\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md-app/226/1/#p4\">\n    126 A.3d 739\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

In 1999, TWGDAM was renamed the Scientific Working Group on DNA Analysis Methods, or \"SWGDAM.\" SWGDAM,\n   <em>\n    History &amp; Evo\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    lution of DNA QA Standards\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   at 3. In December 2000, the DNA Advisory Board expired at the end of its statutory term and transferred its responsibility for recommending revisions to the QAS to SWGDAM.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 22;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 14131(b)(4) (\"The board shall cease to exist on the date 5 years after the initial appointments are made to the board ....\"). Thus, by December 2000, both of the standards-setting bodies named in the DNA Admissibility Statute had ceased to exist, at least under the names specified in the Statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Recognizing this discrepancy in the statutory language, the General Assembly twice attempted to amend CJP \u00a7 10-915 between 2000 and 2015. In 2001, House Bill 857 proposed to amend the Statute by simply replacing all references to \"TWGDAM\" with \"SWGDAM.\" House Bill 857, 2001 Leg., 415th Sess. (Md. 2001). DNA evidence would remain automatically admissible under the Statute if the analysis had \"been validated by standards established by [TWGDAM] SWGDAM or the DNA Advisory Board.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (brackets in original to show deletion from existing law).

House Bill 274, 2006 Leg., 421st Sess.

OPD,\n   <em>\n    Position on Proposed Legislation-House Bill 274\n   </em>\n   (Feb. 15, 2006). OPD explained that \"[t]he SWGDAM entity is expected to exist for the foreseeable future, reflects the views of the national forensic science community as opposed to only those of the Director of the FBI and is the only logical set of guidelines on which to base this legislation.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The Maryland State Bar Association (\"MSBA\") also opposed the Bill, and similarly stated that \"while SWGDAM communicates among its members and updates its scientific findings regularly, the FBI does not do so. To subject DNA evidence to standards approved in 1998 and 1999 by the FBI ignores scientific developments which have been discovered since that time.\" MSBA,\n   <em>\n    Position on House Bill 274\n   </em>\n   (Feb. 22, 2006). The Bill passed the House and received a hearing in the Senate Judicial Proceedings Committee, but no further action was taken.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   General Assembly of Maryland,\n   <em>\n    Bill Info-House Bill 274\n   </em>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Meanwhile, the QAS issued by the DNA Advisory Board in 1998 and 1999 remained in force as the minimum requirements for DNA testing in forensics laboratories throughout the country. The DNA Identification Act requires all DNA laboratories that are federally funded or operated, or participate in the National DNA Index System, to demonstrate compliance with the QAS. FBI,\n   <em>\n    Combined DNA Index System (CODIS)\n   </em>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   The FBI monitors laboratories' compliance with the QAS through its annual audit process. Every other year, forensics laboratories must undergo an external audit to ensure that their procedures comply with the QAS. During in-between years, the laboratories are permitted to undertake an internal audit, where the laboratories' own scientists evaluate their procedures for compliance with the QAS. At the pre-\n   <em>\n    Frye\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    -\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Reed\n   </em>\n   hearing in this case, Ms. Charak testified that the National Forensic Science Technology Center performed an external audit on the Prince George's County Laboratory in July 2010, and determined that the Laboratory was in compliance with the QAS.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Also during this time, SWGDAM continued its duty of periodically recommending revisions to the QAS to reflect scientific and technological advancements in DNA testing. SWGDAM,\n   <em>\n    About Us\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   . In 2007, SWGDAM submitted to the FBI Director its recommendation for substantial revisions to the QAS. The FBI Director adopted these recommendations and issued the first revised QAS in October 2008, with an effective date of July 1, 2009.\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   SWGDAM,\n   <em>\n    History &amp; Evolution of DNA QA Standards\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   at 31. In 2011, SWGDAM submitted its recommendation for additional, minor revisions to the QAS, which were approved by the FBI Director with an effective date of September 1, 2011.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 38-39. Thus, the\n   2007 version of the QAS were the relevant standards when the Prince George's County Laboratory performed its analysis in this case (in June 2011), and when it was audited by the National Forensic Science Technology Center (in July 2010).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   This history makes pellucid that the lower courts were correct in finding that TWGDAM and the DNA Advisory Board did not exist under those names at the time the Prince George's County Laboratory received its statement of validation, or at the time the analysis in this case was performed. However, that finding is not dispositive of whether the Laboratory's analysis satisfied the requirement of CJP \u00a7 10-915(b). All that is required for automatic admissibility under that provision is \"[a] statement from the testing laboratory setting forth that the analysis of genetic loci has been validated by standards established by TWGDAM or the DNA Advisory Board.\" \u00a7 10-915(b). The Statute does not require that either of these entities remain in existence at the time the procedures are validated, or when the analysis is performed. As long as the laboratory's procedures have been validated by standards previously established by one of these entities, and the analysis is performed in accordance with those validated procedures,\n   then the analysis qualifies for automatic admissibility under the Statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Although the QAS are not explicitly mentioned in the DNA Admissibility Statute (before the 2016 amendments), they are literally \"standards established by ... the DNA Advisory Board.\" As described above, the QAS are two sets of standards for DNA testing and databasing promulgated by the DNA Advisory Board in 1998 and 1999, respectively. And while the FBI Director revised the QAS in 2007 at the recommendation of SWGDAM, we do not believe that these subsequent revisions, by an entity not explicitly named in the statute, transform the 2007 QAS into something other than \"standards established by ... the DNA Advisory Board.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Furthermore, we view the General Assembly's decision not to amend the Statute between 2000 and 2015, despite multiple proposals, as an indication that legislators did not view the\n   Statute as \"obsolete\" or ineffective. To the contrary, this inaction illustrates that the previous version of the Statute continued to serve its purpose of allowing for the automatic admissibility of DNA evidence without the need for\n   <em>\n    Frye\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    -\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Reed\n   </em>\n   hearings. It was not until the Court of Special Appeals interpreted the Statute as \"obsolete\" that the General Assembly decided to amend the Statute for clarification. The 2016 amendments made clear that, although the standards-setting bodies named in the Statute no longer exist under those names, the standards they promulgated remain in effect.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Therefore, we hold that the Prince George's County Laboratory's statement of validation, that the DNA analysis in this case was \"determined by procedures which have been validated according to the Federal Bureau of Investigation's Quality Assurance Standards for Forensic DNA Testing Laboratories,\" satisfies the requirement of CJP \u00a7 10-915(b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     D. Adequacy of the QAS\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Alternatively, Mr. Phillips argues that even if compliance with the QAS is sufficient for automatic admissibility under CJP \u00a7 10-915, it should not be sufficient to admit the particular DNA analysis performed in this case because the QAS do not have standards pertaining to complex, low-template DNA. The State responds that while the QAS do not specifically address complex, low-template DNA, they also do not preclude analyses of this category of DNA evidence. Therefore, the State asserts, because the Prince George's County Laboratory followed all applicable QAS when performing its analysis, the DNA evidence qualifies for automatic admissibility under CJP \u00a7 10-915.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   At the pre-\n   <em>\n    Frye\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    -\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Reed\n   </em>\n   hearing, Ms. Charak-testifying for the State-and Dr. Charlotte Word-testifying for Mr. Phillips-generally agreed that the QAS do not specifically address complex, low-template DNA. Dr. Word testified that the QAS do not distinguish between \"two-person mixture[s], three-person mixtures, four-person mixtures, good quality DNA, [or] low quality DNA.\" Ms. Charak, when asked if she\n   was \"aware of a standard that has been generally accepted within the scientific community for reliably interpreting complex mixtures of low template DNA,\" responded, \"A standard? There is no such standard.\" Additionally, the trial court found that there were SWGDAM guidelines \"in place as of 2009\" that dealt with complex DNA mixtures, but these guidelines had not yet been adopted by the FBI Director and incorporated into the QAS. The trial court also found that the Prince George's County Laboratory was not following the SWGDAM guidelines, and that it did \"not have specific protocols as it relates to the complex mixtures that are addressed in this case.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   The trial court's findings that the QAS did not address complex, low-template\n   DNA and that the Prince George's County Laboratory did not have any protocols for analyzing this category of DNA, are not clearly erroneous; however, those findings are not relevant to the admissibility of DNA evidence under CJP \u00a7 10-915. All that is required for admissibility under the Statute is \"[a] statement from the testing laboratory setting forth that the analysis of genetic loci has been validated by standards established by TWGDAM or the DNA Advisory Board,\" and compliance with the notice requirements. As we stated above, the Laboratory satisfied these requirements with respect to the DNA evidence admitted against Mr. Phillips. Therefore, the DNA evidence was automatically admissible under the Statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   In essence, Mr. Phillips argues that mere compliance with the DNA Admissibility Statute is not good enough for automatic admissibility when the DNA analysis at issue is not covered by any applicable standards. However, the legislative history detailed above and the recent amendments to the Statute make clear that CJP \u00a7 10-915 was not intended to be a \"best practices\" statute. In 2006, both OPD and the MSBA opposed amending the Statute to state that compliance with the QAS is sufficient for automatic admissibility. Both organizations asserted that SWGDAM was the proper standards-setting body because their guidelines reflect ongoing scientific development, whereas the QAS do not.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   OPD,\n   <em>\n    Position on\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Proposed Legislation-House Bill 274\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   ; MSBA,\n   <em>\n    Position on House Bill 274\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   . Similarly, at the Senate Judicial Proceedings Committee hearing on the 2016 proposed amendments to the Statute, Stephen Mercer, Chief Attorney of the Forensics Division of OPD,\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n   testified that the Statute should be amended such that compliance with SWGDAM guidelines is required for automatic admissibility.\n   <em>\n    Evidence-Admissibility of DNA Profile-Definition and Validation of DNA Profile: Hearing on Senate Bill 637 Before Senate Committee on Judicial Proceedings\n   </em>\n   , 2016 Leg., 436th Sess. (Md. 2016) (statement of Stephen Mercer, Chief Attorney, Forensics Division, OPD).\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n   Mr. Mercer noted that the SWGDAM guidelines apply to \"cutting-edge\" DNA technology, while the QAS do not.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Despite these objections, the General Assembly passed and Governor Hogan signed Senate Bill 637, which made explicit that compliance with the QAS is sufficient for the automatic admissibility of DNA evidence.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   2016 Md. Laws, ch. 570. The current Statute does not mention SWGDAM. We view this as an indication that CJP \u00a7 10-915 was not intended to be a \"best practices\" statute, such that only DNA evidence that has been analyzed in accordance \"with the standards promulgated by the most rigorous standards-setting body available\" would qualify for automatic admissibility.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Phillips\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4031052\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md-app/226/1/#p4\">\n    226 Md.App. at 14\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4031052\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md-app/226/1/#p4\">\n    126 A.3d 739\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Instead, the DNA Admissibility Statute allows for the admission of any DNA evidence, both cutting-edge and traditional, without the need to establish its general acceptance and reliability under\n   <em>\n    Frye\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    -\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Reed\n   </em>\n   , so long as the analysis was performed in accordance with the minimum requirements promulgated by the FBI. The Prince George's County Laboratory's analysis complied with these minimum requirements; that the federal standards do not specifically\n   address analyses of complex, low-template DNA samples is immaterial to admissibility under the Statute.\n   That the DNA evidence was automatically admissible under the Statute does not mean that Mr. Phillips was entirely unable to challenge such evidence. Mr. Phillips could have attacked the weight to be given the DNA evidence based on the lack of an accepted standard for analyzing complex, low-template DNA samples by either cross-examining Ms. Charak at trial or calling a rebuttal expert as he did at the pretrial hearings. In fact, defense counsel did cross-examine Ms. Charak regarding her qualifications to perform this type of analysis and questioned the legitimacy of some of the methodologies she employed. However, Mr. Phillips did not present his rebuttal expert, Dr. Word, to fully explain the alleged issues with the analysis that Ms. Charak performed. As the Court of Special Appeals noted, \"[w]e find it telling that [Mr.] Phillips chose not to do so.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4031052\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md-app/226/1/#p4\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4031052\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md-app/226/1/#p4\">\n    at 23\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4031052\" index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md-app/226/1/#p4\">\n    126 A.3d 739\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   We hold that the statement of validation that accompanied the Prince George's County Laboratory's analysis of the DNA evidence introduced against Mr. Phillips satisfied the requirement of CJP \u00a7 10-915(b), and therefore the DNA evidence was automatically admissible.
