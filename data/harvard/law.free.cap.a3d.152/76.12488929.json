Ward, Jr., and Rose Mary Ward, after a trial to the court, quieting title to a claimed easement in the form of a right-of-way (right-of-way) over the defendants' real property (property).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The court determined that the Marketable Title Act (act), General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 47-33b et seq., extinguished the right-of-way because it was not preserved in the roots of title of the parties as required by the act and did not meet the apparent easement exceptions in General Statutes \u00a7 47-33h. On appeal, the plaintiff claims that the court erred in finding that the act extinguished its right-of-way (1) because it predated and was not properly set forth in either root of title; and (2) although there were visible, physical indicators of the existence of the right-of-way. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   In the first count of its complaint against the defendants, the church, and Citizens Bank, dated July 9, 2012, and returned to the court on August 1, 2012, the plaintiff sought to quiet title to the alleged deeded right-of-way over the defendants' property and the church's property.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The defendants alleged as a special defense, inter alia, that the act extinguished any rights that the plaintiff had to the claimed right-of-way. Following a trial\n   to the\n   court,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   the court,\n   <em>\n    Moukawsher\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    J.\n   </em>\n   , rendered judgment in favor of the defendants and Citizens Bank on June 9, 2015, and in favor of the plaintiff, as stipulated between it and the church. This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The following factual findings of the court are relevant to this appeal. In 1877, an easement in the form of a right-of-way was created over property now owned separately by the defendants and the church in favor of property now owned by the plaintiff. Pursuant to the act, the plaintiff's root of title\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   is a 1968 deed that conveyed the property \"[t]ogether with and subject to such rights of way, pipe line and other easements and privileges as will of record appear.\" The defendants' roots of title are one or two 1944 deeds\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   that referred\n   to a \"Frank Calvert\" \"right of way.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   The 1944 deeds did not set forth that the property is subject to the Frank Calvert right-of-way, did not describe the right-of-way's metes and bounds, and did not incorporate by volume and page the title transaction that created that right-of-way.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The court found that as of the dates of the trial, the alleged right-of-way area showed no evidence of ruts or marks that might suggest that it had been used as a cart path or track as claimed by the plaintiff. Photographs in evidence showed that the only open area within the alleged right-of-way revealed nothing to suggest its use as a cart path or track. The photographs showed that much of the disputed area was strewn with boulders, was covered with mature trees, and was incapable of accommodating any kind of path. From this and other evidence, the court concluded that there were no signs of a cart path or track on the property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In its memorandum of decision, the court concluded that the defendants' muniments of title\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   did not describe the right-\n   of-way sufficiently to enforce it and that the muniments of title did not specifically identify the recorded title transaction that created the right-of-way. In its analysis, the court rejected the plaintiff's argument that references to the right-of-way in the 1944 deeds were necessary to determine the location of the five tracts conveyed therein. Consequently, the court concluded that the act extinguished the right-of-way unless\n   an exception applied. The plaintiff argued that merestones\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   marking the right-of-way, a wire fence running along it, and signs of a cart path were physical evidence sufficient to satisfy one of the \u00a7 47-33h exceptions. The court concluded that fences and merestones were not included in the list of exceptions contained in \u00a7 47-33h and, although roads and tracks were included in the list, there were no signs of a cart path or tracks on the property. Accordingly, the court found that \u00a7 47-33h did not apply. In light of these determinations, the court declared that the defendants' property was not subject, under General Statutes \u00a7 47-31, to the purported right-of-way described in volume 21, page 99, and volume 21, page 100 of the Montville land records.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The plaintiff claims that the trial court erred in determining that the act extinguished the right-of-way because the right-of-way predated the roots of title. Specifically, it contends that the reference to the Frank Calvert right-of-way in the 1944 deeds that constitute the defendants' roots of title is a specific reference satisfying \u00a7 47-33h. Additionally, the plaintiff argues that reference to the right-of-way in the deeds puts a reasonable title searcher on notice of the existence of\n   an easement and that determination of the location of the right-of-way was necessary to ascertain the location of the three parcels constituting the defendants' property. The defendants argue that their roots of title do not specifically identify a recorded title transaction creating the right-of-way and that the description of the right-of-way was too vague to convey it. We agree with the defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   We begin by setting forth the applicable standard of review. \"The interpretation of a statute, as well as its applicability to a given set of facts and circumstances, presents a question of law over which our review is plenary....

Essentially, the plaintiff argues that the statute allows for any physical evidence of an easement. The defendants counter that the statute does not include merestones, fence posts, or car tracks, but is limited to \"large industrial equipment typically used by public service companies....\" Although we disagree with both interpretations advanced by the parties, we conclude that the statutory exception contained in \u00a7 47-33h does not apply to preserve the right-of-way claimed by the plaintiff.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   We begin by setting forth the applicable standards of review. \"The interpretation of a statute, as well as its applicability to a given set of facts and circumstances, presents a question of law over which our review is plenary.\"\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Sourignamath\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3751083\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/90/388/#p393\">\n    90 Conn.App. at 393-94\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=877%20A.2d%20891\">\n    877 A.2d 891\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Additionally, \u00a7 47-33d clarifies that this portion of \u00a7 47-33h applies to apparent easements and interests in the nature of easements. Section 47-33h protects the interest of \"the United States, of this state or any political subdivision thereof, of any public service company as defined in section 16-1 or of any natural gas company\" apart from the enumeration herein described. Accordingly, the class enumerated in the statute cannot be limited to public utility uses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Defining the class as \"those physical objects that evidence an easement that themselves effectuate the easement itself\" includes all of the items enumerated in \u00a7 47-33h, but not dissimilar items. For example, the location of a sewer beneath a property would evidence a sewer easement, whereas the location of poles and wires traversing the property would evidence an easement to a telephone company or electrical company for such use. Stated this way, the class does not include items that may be found on a property that are not set forth in \u00a7 47-33h or otherwise within the class of those items, which are only, at best, mere indirect, possible indicators of an easement.\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   After setting forth the proper class, it is clear that merestones and fences are not a part of the class of other physical facilities creating an exemption from the application of the act. Merestones are defined as markers of a boundary, but not necessarily of an easement in the form of a right-of-way within or across a parcel of land. A fence also is not necessarily a marker of an easement in the form of a right-of-way. It is common knowledge that a fence can have many uses aside from marking a boundary of a parcel of land; for example, it can separate one interior parcel of land from another, it can restrict pets or livestock to a certain area within a parcel of land, it can surround and protect against access to a hazardous condition, or it can be purely decorative. A fence or a\n   merestone, even if visible on part on the defendants' property, is not necessary or integral to the definition, use, existence, or identification of the plaintiff's claimed right-of-way in this case in the way that a road, sewer, or pipe would identify and carry out the purposes of an easement excepted by \u00a7 47-33h.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Moreover, although this court and the plaintiff might be able to imagine other physical evidence that could suggest the possibility, or even probability, of an easement, our legislature made its choice in creating a list of indicators of an apparent easement to achieve its goal of \"simplify[ing] land title transactions through making it possible to determine marketability by limited title searches over some reasonable period of the immediate past and thus avoid the necessity of examining the record back into distant time for each new transaction.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Il Giardino, LLC\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Belle Haven Land Co.\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1116853\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/254/502/#p537\">\n    254 Conn. at 537\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=757%20A.2d%201103\">\n    757 A.2d 1103\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . To expand the excepted list of items contained in \u00a7 47-33h to include dissimilar items, such as fences and merestones, could expose landowners to stale claims\n   against their properties and, thus, counteract the broad remedial purposes of the act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Accordingly, fences and merestones are not included as a matter of law within the definition of \"other physical facility,\" and, therefore, the court did not err in concluding that the presence of a fence and merestones on the defendants' property did not except the plaintiff's claims to a right-of-way from application of the act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The judgment is affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   In this opinion the other judges concurred.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-40\">\n    St. John's Roman Catholic Church of Montville (church) and Citizens Bank, also known as RBS Citizens, N.A.

In describing the property, the deeds are identical. Whether the defendants' root of title was one deed, or two deeds that were identical except for the parties thereto, it does not affect our analysis or conclusions. For convenience, we will refer to the defendants' root of title as the two 1944 deeds. The 1944 deeds conveyed five tracts.
