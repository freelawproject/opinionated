Proc.\") of the Maryland Code, provides relief to a Petitioner who alleges \"newly discovered evidence\" that he was erroneously deemed criminally responsible during his 1985 reverse waiver hearing, when he should have been deemed not criminally responsible (\"NCR\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   On October 22, 1984, then fifteen-year-old Dameron Smallwood (\"Petitioner\") fatally stabbed Madge K. Gibson (\"Ms. Gibson\") in her Baltimore County apartment. Petitioner was charged as an adult, but sought to be tried as a juvenile. At a reverse waiver hearing,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   held February 6-\n   7, and March 8,\n   1985, several psychiatric experts testified regarding Petitioner's amenability to treatment and opined that he was not \"legally insane\" at the time of the crime. The circuit court denied Petitioner's request to transfer the case back to juvenile court. Petitioner was subsequently convicted of first-degree murder and other related charges following a not guilty, agreed statement of facts proceeding, and sentenced to life in prison.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Twenty-six years later, the psychiatrist who originally examined Petitioner concluded her original diagnosis was incorrect. The psychiatrist now opined that Petitioner should have been deemed NCR at the time of his 1985 proceedings. Petitioner subsequently filed a petition for \"writ of actual innocence\" under Crim. Proc. \u00a7 8-301, alleging that this revised expert opinion constituted \"newly discovered evidence\" that generated a \"substantial or significant possibility that the result [of Petitioner's 1985 proceeding] may have been different.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   For the reasons that follow, we shall affirm the Circuit Court for Baltimore County's denial of Petitioner's petition for a writ of actual innocence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   For purposes of our discussion, the events giving rise to our inquiry revolve around three events: (1) the reverse waiver\n   hearing held on February 6, 7 and March 8, 1985; (2) the plea agreement proceeding where Petitioner pled not guilty on an agreed statement of facts held on March 13, 1985; and (3) the motions hearing relative to the petition for writ of actual innocence held on November 2, 2012.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   According to Dr. Ellen McDaniel's (\"Dr. McDaniel's\") original January 24, 1985 psychiatric report, her testimony from Petitioner's 1985 reverse waiver hearing, and her deposition testimony from November 17, 2011, Petitioner grew up in a highly abusive, toxic domestic environment that greatly impacted his mental development. Petitioner's father was an alcoholic, and his mother was \"an extremely bizarre, at times explosive woman\" who suffered from severe mental illness. As a child, Petitioner was verbally and physically abused by his mother. She once beat Petitioner and his siblings so badly that they required hospitalization. She also threatened \"to beat [Petitioner] on the head and watch his brains flow out.\" By the age of ten, Petitioner had lived in three foster homes, which were also abusive settings, and attended several different schools. Petitioner also spent two years in a residential psychiatric facility for children, before returning to live with his mother. During this time, Petitioner and his brother slept on the floor, and did not have sufficient clothing to wear to school.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In the week prior to Ms. Gibson's death, Petitioner was suspended from school for talking back to a teacher. Petitioner's mother became angry and refused to let him leave the house for several days. She also screamed, nagged, and yelled at him repeatedly throughout the weekend. At one point, she told him \"she was going to cut [him] up and put [him] in a bag and throw [him] in the dumpster.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On the morning of October 22, 1984, Petitioner's mother finally let Petitioner leave the house to purchase cat food. While Petitioner was out, he continued to hear her voice, screaming, like a \"buzzing in his ear,\" and began fantasizing.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   After purchasing\n   the cat food, Petitioner went to his old neighborhood and the apartment building where he had previously lived with his mother. Petitioner knocked on the door of one of the apartments and a woman answered. Petitioner asked if the \"man of the house was home,\" but when the woman's husband came to the door, Petitioner mumbled about being at the wrong house and left.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Petitioner then knocked on Ms. Gibson's door, and announced he had a package to deliver that required Ms. Gibson's signature. When Ms. Gibson opened the door, while on the phone with her daughter, Petitioner stabbed her ten times.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thereafter, Petitioner fled, and was observed disposing of a bloody, brown paper bag, and several articles of clothing disappeared from his person. Ms. Gibson later died from her injuries.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Reverse Waiver Hearing\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   After Petitioner was indicted for first-degree murder and related offenses, his attorneys petitioned for a reverse waiver hearing to transfer Petitioner's case from adult to juvenile court. During the reverse waiver hearing, held on February 6, 7 and March 8, 1985, Petitioner's attorneys first called Dr. Lawrence Donner (\"Dr. Donner\"), a psychologist, to testify about his diagnoses of Petitioner. Dr. Donner testified that he diagnosed Petitioner with: (1) major depression, recurrent, and (2) an identity disorder. Dr. Donner defined \"identity disorder\" as:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   a condition which if not treated develops into a borderline personality, which indicates that an individual who is rather extremely unpredictable, may have explosive rage attacks, has problems about their own identity because they have never had a role model to identify with, have marked changes in their mood have [a] poor notion of who they are.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Dr. Donner also explained that a diagnosis of borderline personality disorder was excluded as to Petitioner because\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   [t]here is a problem with diagnostic impressions, and that is his age. He fits very well a diagnosis of borderline personality, but because of his age one cannot make that diagnosis in view of that diagnosis involves the fact that he suffers from, what I see as major depression, recurrent, that he has been depressed much of his life and that he suffers from an identity disorder.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   You cannot make the diagnosis of borderline personality until an individual is 18 years of age because they are still malleable, still plastic. But if [Petitioner] had the same features that he has now at 18 years of age there is no question in my mind a diagnosis-I would diagnose him as a borderline personality just by virtue of age.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Dr. Donner also opined that Petitioner did not suffer from a mental disorder that caused him to be \"legally insane,\" specifically stating that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   [ ] I am airing conservatively[.] [I]t's conceivable he was having a psychotic\n   episode, but I am not testifying to that effect. I cannot say that that didn't happen, but I am not testifying that it did. [Petitioner] has difficulty distinguishing at times between reality and fantasy. I am not here to testify that he was psychotic at the time, but I cannot say that he wasn't psychotic.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Dr. Donner concluded that, without treatment, Petitioner had \"a good chance of becoming a borderline personality.\" Dr. Donner recommended that Petitioner be waived to juvenile court so he could be admitted into a secure treatment facility.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Petitioner's attorneys then called Dr. McDaniel to testify regarding her diagnoses of Petitioner and the January 24, 1985 psychiatric report she authored regarding his mental status. Dr. McDaniel concluded that Petitioner was \"definitely suffering from a mental disorder[,]\" and \"his problems were intimately tied up [with] the crime.\" Dr. McDaniel also found that Petitioner had been \"absorbed\" in his \"Jack the Ripper fantasy\" when he attacked Ms. Gibson,\n   <em>\n    see supra\n   </em>\n   n. 2, but noted that Petitioner told her Ms. Gibson's \"screams 'made me snap out of it. I realized that what I was doing was wrong.' \" Dr. McDaniel also noted several times in her report that Petitioner appeared \"depressed\" during her interviews with him. Ultimately, Dr. McDaniel concluded in her report that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   [Petitioner] is an emotionally disturbed fifteen year old boy who lives a great portion of his life in fantasies. He has suffered through significant trauma during his childhood; including physical and emotional abuse, constant separations and abandonments by family members, and institutionalization in foster homes and a psychiatric facility. The content of his fantasies partially reflects his rage and feelings of helplessness that have developed over years of repeated severe stress. These fantasies also protect him from feeling despair by endowing him with superpowers which enable him to avoid oppression by adults and win admiration. I do not find him psychotic because he does not demonstrate the thought process disturbance, the paranoid ideation, or the extreme mood swings that are symptoms of psychotic illness. However, [Petitioner's] contact with reality is tenuous and when under stress, he withdraws into his daydreams for comfort and escape.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   During the reverse waiver hearing, Dr. McDaniel acknowledged she had difficulty diagnosing Petitioner due to his age because he was \"emotionally still in the process of changing,\" and she \"could not pigeonhole him into a diagnosis[.]\" On that basis, Dr. McDaniel chose diagnostic categories that were flexible, but not necessarily the most \"accurate reflections of what[ ] [was] going on.\" Ultimately, Dr. McDaniel diagnosed\n   Petitioner with: (1) atypical conduct disorder of adolescence,\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   and (2) mixed personality disorder with depressive and schizoid features. Dr. McDaniel indicated that she diagnosed Petitioner with a conduct disorder due to his age. She also noted that when she discussed mixed personality disorder with depressive and schizoid features, she was emphasizing her two main findings: (1) that Petitioner was severely depressed, and (2) that Petitioner deals with his conflicts and depression by withdrawing into a fantasy world-the schizoid aspect. Dr. McDaniel further explained that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   When I talk about a personality disorder I am-what is referred to is a sort of a life-style of difficulty, usually in the area of interpersonal relationships. When I say mixed personality disorder, again, I don't think that [Petitioner] has solidified in that diagnostic category. So it's one of those diagnoses that says he really doesn't belong in any other diagnosis [sic], that it's an open door yet. But basically what I am referring to is a lifelong history of difficulty in relationships with others. In large part this has been because he has not had any stable, consistent, supportive figures with whom to relate. And it has been reflected in other areas, such as his peer group relationships, his difficulty relating to authority figures and his retreat from relationships into his fantasy world. That's what I meant by the personality disorder.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Despite these diagnoses, Dr. McDaniel concluded that Petitioner was not \"legally insane\" at the time he stabbed Ms. Gibson. Dr. McDaniel also recommended that Petitioner be adjudicated by the juvenile court because he would benefit from treatment in a secure facility rather than in prison.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Dr. James E. Smith, II, a court psychiatrist, also testified, but was not asked about Petitioner's criminal responsibility. Dr. Smith stated that on the one occasion he met with\n   Petitioner, Petitioner was oriented, coherent, and displayed no signs of psychosis. Dr. Smith diagnosed Petitioner with a personality disorder.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The circuit court denied Petitioner's request for a reverse waiver. At no point during the proceeding was the extent of Petitioner's criminal responsibility contested or discussed at length by either party or any of the psychiatric experts who testified.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Thereafter, on March 13, 1985, Petitioner followed the advice of his attorney and entered a plea of not guilty on an agreed statement of facts. On the same day, Petitioner was convicted of first-degree murder and other related offenses, and sentenced to life in prison.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Dr. McDaniel's Revised Psychiatric Diagnoses\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   In 2009, Petitioner was represented by a new attorney who requested Dr. McDaniel reconsider her prior opinion that Petitioner was not \"legally insane\" at the time of the 1985 reverse waiver hearing. Dr. McDaniel reassessed her 1985 opinion, and in 2011 reached the contrary conclusion that Petitioner was NCR when he stabbed Ms. Gibson in 1984. Dr. McDaniel determined that at the time of the offense, Petitioner was actually suffering from: (1) major depressive disorder, severe, with episodes of dissociation, and (2) post-traumatic stress disorder (\"PTSD\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Dr. McDaniel attributed her revised opinion to several findings that she argued were not available when she originally evaluated Petitioner. Notably, Dr. McDaniel cited scientists' better understanding of dissociation,\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   particularly in connection\n   to PTSD. Dr. McDaniel also noted that scientists had learned more about PTSD and how \"stress actually changes the anatomical features of the brain[.]\" She also found\n   that trauma \"changes the brain circuitry[ ]\" and can increase the chance of developing certain disorders, including PTSD. These changes can also cause someone to \"misperceive[ ] current day situations[.]\" Dr. McDaniel stated that research on the biological basis for this phenomenon appeared only in the last several years, even though the PTSD diagnosis has existed since before the 1980s.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Dr. McDaniel also contended that the \"diagnostic nomenclature\" in the DSM had changed. For example, in the 1980s the DSM-III said that \"diagnosis of a Personality Disorder should be made only when the characteristic features are typical of the individual's long-term functioning[,]\" but the manual observed that \"manifestations are generally recognizable by adolescence or earlier and continue throughout most of adult life....\" DSM-III at 305. In contrast, the DSM-IV-TR, published in 2000, states that \"Personality Disorder categories may be applied to children or adolescents\" only in \"relatively unusual instances,\" because \"traits of a Personality Disorder that appear in childhood will often not persist unchanged into adult life.\" Am. Psychiatric Ass'n, DIAGNOSTIC AND STATISTICAL MANUAL OF MENTAL DISORDERS 687 (4th ed., text rev., 2000). Considering those scientific advances, revisions in the DSM, and her post-hoc professional experience since the 1980s, Dr. McDaniel concluded that her initial diagnosis of an atypical conduct disorder or mixed personality disorder was na\u00efve and incorrect.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Based on her revised diagnoses, Dr. McDaniel further concluded that Petitioner was NCR at the time of the offense because his \"major depression with dissociative episodes and PTSD\" rendered him unable to conform his behavior to the requirements of law. Dr. McDaniel concluded that during the stabbing of Ms. Gibson, Petitioner had \"brok[en] with reality during [his] periods of dissociation,\" including the day of the offense. Dr. McDaniel acknowledged that Petitioner made decisions and acted deliberately before\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   and after the crime,\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   but that Petitioner slipped into\n   an \"altered state of consciousness[ ]\" at the time he stabbed Ms. Gibson.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   Dr. McDaniel also\n   indicated that Petitioner's deliberate actions before and after the offense may \"look[ ] like conscious behavior, but we don't know what he [was] doing in his mind;\" and his actions could have been a \"reflection of this fantasy[,]\"\n   <em>\n    see supra\n   </em>\n   fn. 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   <strong>\n    III. Petition for Writ of Actual Innocence\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   On August 29, 2011, Petitioner filed a Petition for Writ of Actual Innocence pursuant to Crim. Proc. \u00a7 8-301. Petitioner requested the court vacate his conviction and order a new trial because \"the discovery of the lack of criminal responsibility...is newly discovered evidence which creates a substantial or significant possibility that the result of [his] prosecution... in 1984-85 may have been different.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   On November 2, 2012, the Circuit Court for Baltimore County conducted an evidentiary hearing on the petition. The circuit court received Dr. McDaniel's 2011 deposition testimony discussing the bases for her revised diagnoses.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Court also heard live testimony from the State's expert, clinical psychiatrist Dr. Christiane Tellefsen (\"Dr. Tellefsen\"), who disputed the psychiatric basis for Dr. McDaniel's revised opinion. Dr. Tellefsen first noted that PTSD was an available diagnosis in 1984 and was included in the DSM III,\n   <em>\n    see supra\n   </em>\n   fn. 6, and that it was actually a more common diagnosis in the 1980s then it is now.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   Dr. Tellefsen testified that Petitioner's\n   history was consistent with a diagnosis of PTSD, and that a key symptom for individuals suffering from PTSD is \"avoidance[,]\" meaning the individual tends \"to withdraw from society or withdraw from situations that are stressful to them.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Dr. Tellefsen also noted that dissociation is a symptom rather than a diagnosis, and that when a person dissociates \"they're often engaged in automatic behavior so they're not engaged in novel behavior[,]\" and one of the first things a diagnostician looks at if someone says they dissociated is \"what [ ] the thing [was] that they were\n   doing, was this a novel physical activity for them or a novel activity in general for them. Did it involve automatic behavior, sort of reflexive behavior or not, did it involve intentional behavior or not[?]\" Dr. Tellefsen further testified that,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   [i]n rare cases, someone might diagnosis [sic] a teenager with a personality disorder, but you really-you have to be very careful about that because you don't know what development is going to do to them as they get older. They don't know if they're going to grow out of it essentially. And that has always been understood through the, you know, the DSM III, DSM IV, [DSM] IV-TR... that you have to be very careful about doing that. And there are-I think it's written as a caveat in both editions of the manual.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Dr. Tellefsen concluded the facts in the instant case did not support Dr. McDaniel's revised diagnoses for several reasons. First, Dr. McDaniel's diagnosis of dissociation did not make sense because people who dissociate tend to engage in repetitive, rather than novel behavior, and Petitioner did not have a history of violence. Second, there were no indications that Petitioner was dissociating at any other point before or after the offense.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   Third, Petitioner was not previously diagnosed with dissociation. Dr. Tellefsen also noted that Petitioner was not diagnosed with psychotic behavior, and that individuals who typically satisfy the NCR test have severe mental disorders\n   that cause the individual to lose touch with reality or become psychotic.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   Finally, Dr. Tellefsen testified that Dr. McDaniel could not \"weave\" the PTSD and dissociation diagnoses into Petitioner's activities because the evidence indicated that Petitioner acted deliberately and was able to \"curb[ ] his behavior\" at various points before and after the stabbing.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   During closing arguments, the circuit court observed that Dr. McDaniel's deposition testimony was \"rife with inconsistencies,\" specifically noting that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   I didn't understand anything about-Dr. McDaniel's testimony in the deposition, and I read it carefully and [heard] about this notion that there was no such thing as post-traumatic stress disorder back in 1984 and that she didn't have the ability to diagnose that then, which is what I understood her testimony to have been. That is preposterous. Post-traumatic stress disorder plainly existed as a DSM diagnosis back in 1984. I do not know why she couldn't have diagnosed it back in 1984. She can diagnose it in 2011.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   This episodic dissociation business, you know, I just-I-that's not a DSM III or IV diagnosis. And I recognize that there's some legitimate debate between the parties as to whether or not the evidence supports a logical conclusion that this could have been some sort of a dissociation episode under the circumstances. But again, I imagine, although I didn't hear this, that there was no reason why that couldn't have been a part of the analysis back in 1984.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   And there's this odd business in [Dr. McDaniel's] testimony about the fact that she now believes that you cannot diagnosis [sic] someone under the age of 18 with a personality disorder, but that she was incapable of reaching that conclusion back in 1984. I don't understand that at all.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   On February 12, 2013, the circuit court denied the petition. In its memorandum, the circuit court concluded that Petitioner \"is ineligible to seek relief under an 'actual innocence' statute[ ]' \" because \"he is maintaining that he is actually guilty, but is not criminally responsible.\" After reviewing the legislative history of Crim. Proc. \u00a7 8-301, the circuit court found that,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n   the plain language of the statute and its legislative history suggest that its application was meant to be limited to those who are innocent of the crime. Nothing about the legislative history of the provision suggests that it was intended to include a claim made decades after a conviction that a defendant was guilty of a crime, but not criminally responsible for its commission.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   The circuit court also observed that,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-56\">\n   [w]hile expert opinion testimony is certainly 'evidence' in the broad sense of the word, the courts must be especially vigilant in assessing the reliability and the credibility of an opinion which comes about more than a quarter century after a final verdict under these circumstances. Generally, it is safe to conclude that an expert's opinion, which changes 26 years after the original opinion is rendered, because the expert \"lacked experience\" when the original opinion was rendered will never be considered \"newly discovered evidence\" under any rational standard.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   The circuit court concluded that Dr. McDaniel's revised opinion was not \"newly discovered evidence,\" because \"[t]here was no change between 1984 and the present in the\n   <em>\n    facts\n   </em>\n   of this case. No new or different fact was unearthed or otherwise discovered suggesting that the Petitioner's [proceeding] was unfair in 198[5].\" (Emphasis in original).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   The circuit court also found that, even if a revised expert's opinion qualified as newly discovered evidence, Dr. McDaniel's revised testimony should be accorded \"[virtually no weight].\" The circuit court noted that Dr. McDaniel's testimony was \"generally replete with psychological double-speak and rationalizations designed to obfuscate.\" The circuit court also found\n   that \"throughout [Dr. McDaniel's] testimony she refused to commit to a concrete timeframe within which the Petitioner was allegedly dissociating, or an explanation as to why this dissociation would have formed an adequate basis for a plea of not criminally responsible.\" The circuit court concluded,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-59\">\n   Dr. McDaniel failed utterly to convince the undersigned that she could not have made the same diagnosis in 1984 as she made in 2011; or that she could not have reached the same conclusion concerning the lack of criminal responsibility in 1984 as she purported to reach in 2011. She did not persuade the undersigned that the DSM-III contained material mistakes or errors in 1984 that, if changed, would have affected her opinion as to criminal responsibility in 1984. Her 2011 analysis was illogical, and her conclusions were unreliable as a matter of the application of ordinary common sense.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   The circuit court also concluded it could not \"attribute significant weight to [Dr. McDaniel's] 'new' opinions[ ]\" because she described Petitioner's mental state as \"fantasy,\" \"a daydream,\" and \"breaking with reality,\" but \"fail [ed] to commit herself to a logically conclusive window of time within which the Petitioner could be deemed to have been incapable of conforming his behavior to the requirements of the law.\" The circuit court observed this was in \"stark contrast to the cogent analysis by Dr. Tellefsen. While Dr. Tellefsen did not evaluate the Petitioner, and while she did not render an opinion on criminal responsibility,\n   her assessment of Dr. McDaniel's diagnostic framework highlighted its rather clear deficiencies.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. The Court of Special Appeals' Opinion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   In a reported opinion, the Court of Special Appeals affirmed the circuit court's denial of the petition.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Dameron Smallwood v.

Black's Law Dictionary also defines \"actual innocence\" as \"[t]he absence of facts that are prerequisites for the sentence given to a defendant.\" BLACK'S LAW DICTIONARY (10th ed. 2014). Under a plain interpretation of these words, \"actual innocence\" means a defendant is not guilty of a crime or offense in fact. In other words, \"actual innocence\" means the defendant did not commit the crime or offense for which he or she was convicted. This interpretation of \"actual innocence\" is further substantiated by a review of the statutory scheme in which Crim.

Statutory Scheme\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   Prior to 2001, a convicted person had two avenues for postconviction relief under Maryland law. First, the convicted person could bring a claim under Title 7 of the Criminal Procedure Article, commonly known as the Uniform Postconviction Procedure Act. Md. Code (Repl. Vol. 2013), \u00a7\u00a7 7-101\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   of the Criminal Procedures Article. Under Crim. Proc. \u00a7 7-102 :\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-110\">\n   (a) ...a convicted person may begin a proceeding...if the person claims that:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-111\">\n   (1) the sentence or judgment was imposed in violation of the Constitution of the United States or the Constitution or laws of the State;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-112\">\n   (2) the court lacked jurisdiction to impose the sentence;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-113\">\n   (3) the sentence exceeds the maximum allowed by law; or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-114\">\n   (4) the sentence is otherwise subject to collateral attack on a ground of alleged error that would otherwise be available under a writ of habeas corpus, writ of coram nobis, or other common law statutory remedy.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   The relief offered to a convicted defendant under Crim. Proc. \u00a7 7-102 is limited, however, to constitutional claims.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=267%20A.2d%20172\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   This postconviction claim must also be filed within ten years after the sentence is imposed, unless extraordinary cause for filing later can be shown. Crim. Proc. \u00a7 7-103(b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   Second, a convicted person could bring a claim for postconviction relief under Maryland Rule 4-331. Maryland Rule 4-331 contains three independent avenues of postconviction relief. First, under sub-section (a), \"[o]n motion of the defendant filed within ten days after a verdict, the court, in the interest of justice, may order a new trial.\" Md. Rule 4-331(a). Second, under sub-section (b),\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-117\">\n   [t]he court has revisory power and control over the judgment to set aside an unjust or improper verdict and grant a new trial:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-118\">\n   (A) in the District Court, on motion filed within 90 days after its imposition\n   of sentence if an appeal has not been perfected;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-119\">\n   (B) in the circuit courts, on motion filed within 90 days after its imposition of sentence.

Proc. \u00a7 8-201.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   The same year that Crim. Proc. \u00a7 8-201 was enacted, we amended Maryland Rule 4-331 to provide that, on a motion filed at any time, a defendant could move for a new trial \"based on DNA identification testing not subject to the procedures of [Crim.

This situation occurs when through no fault of any party [,] critical evidence is simply discovered too late to meet the time limits of Md. Rule 4-331.\n   These defendants have no judicial remedy no matter how meritorious the newly discovered evidence may be.\"). Senator Kelley, a sponsor of the Senate bill that created Crim. Proc \u00a7 8-301, also stated in her testimony to the Senate Judicial Proceedings Committee that, \"[s]ince the development of new evidence sometimes takes more than a decade to materialize, when the evidence becomes available in the case of a wrongfully convicted defendant, there should be\n   available a mechanism for seeking judicial review[,] with the defendant bearing the burden of proof[.]\" Testimony of Senator Delores G.

Proc. \u00a7 8-301 would allow convicted persons to use the statute to assert their \"innocence.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Testimony of Delegate Samuel I. Rosenberg on H.B. 366, before the House Judiciary Committee (Feb. 17, 2009) (\"HB 366 would make certain that convicted persons who discover new evidence supporting their\n   <em>\n    innocence\n   </em>\n   can present that evidence in a court of law.\") (emphasis added); Testimony of Executive Director of the Mid-Atlantic Innocence Project Shawn Armbrust on H.B. 366, before the House Judicial Committee (Feb. 17, 2009) (\"[HB 366] would create a remedy for\n   <em>\n    innocent\n   </em>\n   prisoners who currently have no legal mechanism\n   <em>\n    to prove their innocence\n   </em>\n   in Maryland courts. This bill, if appropriately amended, will result in the\n   <em>\n    freedom of those innocent men and women\n   </em>\n   in Maryland who cannot prove their\n   <em>\n    innocence\n   </em>\n   through DNA testing.\") (emphasis added); State of Maryland Office of the Public Defender, Position on Proposed Legislation: SB 486, submitted to Senate Judicial Proceedings Committee (dated April 1, 2009) (\"The bill is designed to close a gap in Maryland's postconviction and new trial procedures that prevent certain defendants from litigating\n   <em>\n    their claims of innocence\n   </em>\n   and establishing that they have been wrongly convicted.\") (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-140\">\n   Additionally, the testimony discussing the types of evidence the statute might address, confirm that the statute was only intended to apply to petitioners alleging newly discovered evidence that would exonerate them. For example, Delegate Rosenberg contemplated relief for convicted persons under the statute when \"[s]cientific evidence-once thought to be credible-may be found to be unreliable or completely false after subsequent research and analysis\" or \"a confession of guilt by a third person\" comes to light.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Testimony of Delegate Samuel I.

Assistant Public Defender Suzanne Drouet also noted that,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-141\">\n   Science that was one time considered state of the art, for example, comparative bullet lead analysis, arson investigations, microscopic hair analysis, forensic odontology, which is bite-mark analysis, have discovered that they are in fact not particularly accurate and not particularly reliable. But it can take years or decades in some cases to make that discovery. As a result these defendants are also locked out of the courtroom.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-142\">\n   Testimony of Assistant Public Defender Suzanne Drouet on S.B. 486, before the Senate Judicial Proceedings Committee (Feb. 19, 2009). Other stakeholders to the bill also provided categories of evidence that could support a finding of innocence, but were precluded under existing postconviction statutes, including: (1) a confession by another individual to having committed the crime; (2) acknowledgement by an eyewitness or other evidence indicating he was mistaken; (3) acknowledgment by\n   an eyewitness or other evidence indicating that the witness intentionally lied; or (4) evidence casting serious doubt on the reliability of scientific evidence used against the defendant.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Memorandum from the Governor's Office of Crime Control and Prevention and the Office of the Public Defender to Chairman B. Frosh and Members of the Senate Judicial Proceedings Committee, at 8-9 (Jan. 15, 2009). In each example, the contemplated \"newly discovered evidence\" would potentially exonerate the convicted defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-143\">\n   Finally, the testimony presented to the General Assembly repeatedly acknowledged that Crim. Proc. \u00a7 8-301 would only apply to a \"narrow subset\" of convicted persons. Testimony of Senator Delores G. Kelley on S.B. 486, before the Senate Judicial Proceedings Committee (Feb. 19, 2009) (\"Now we are talking about a\n   <em>\n    very narrow subset of people in this bill\n   </em>\n   ....\") (emphasis added);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   State of Maryland Office of the Public Defender, Position on Proposed Legislation: SB 486, submitted to Senate Judicial Proceedings Committee (dated April 1, 2009) (\"This bill affords an avenue of relief for a\n   <em>\n    small\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    number of defendants\n   </em>\n   who otherwise would have no means of litigating their claims of\n   <em>\n    innocence\n   </em>\n   .\") (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-144\">\n   Based on the statutory scheme for postconviction relief under Maryland law, and the legislative history that clarifies the intended purpose of Crim. Proc. \u00a7 8-301, we agree with the State that \"[s]ection 8-301 was designed to enable wrongfully convicted defendants to exonerate themselves using newly discovered non-biological evidence.\" Only defendants who can allege that they are \"actually innocent,\" meaning they did not commit the crimes for which they are convicted, may bring a petition for relief under Crim.

The statute states in relevant part:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-162\">\n    (b) Except as provided in subsection (c) of this section, a court exercising criminal jurisdiction in a case involving a child may transfer the case to the juvenile court before trial or before a plea is entered under Maryland Rule 4-242 if:\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-163\">\n    (1) the accused child was at least 14 but not 18 years of age when the alleged crime was committed;\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-164\">\n    (2) the alleged crime is excluded from the jurisdiction of the juvenile court under \u00a7 3-8A-03(d)(1), (4), or (5) of the Courts Article ; and\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-165\">\n    (3) the court determines by a preponderance of the evidence that a transfer of its jurisdiction is in the interest of the child or society.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-166\">\n    * * *\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-167\">\n    (d) In determining whether to transfer jurisdiction under subsection (b) of this section, the court shall consider:\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-168\">\n    (1) the age of the child;\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-169\">\n    (2) the mental and physical condition of the child;\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-170\">\n    (3) the amenability of the child to treatment in an institution, facility, or program available to delinquent children;\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-171\">\n    (4) the nature of the alleged crime; and\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-172\">\n    (5) the public safety.\n   </blockquote>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-173\">\n    Dr. McDaniel included this statement from Petitioner in her report, which discussed his mental state during the morning of the murder.

Petitioner particularly fantasized about Jack the Ripper, and \"ridding the world of women.\" She also noted that Petitioner told her that on the day of the murder he \"became absorbed in a fantasy about 'killing people secretly, like Jack the Ripper who kills one by one in the night until the whole town is gone, and then goes to another town.' \" She also noted that Petitioner began daydreaming about \" 'doing what Jack the Ripper did[,]' \" and \" 'get[ing] rid of all the women in the world[ ]' \" because \" 'women always get the upper hand' \" and \" 'he couldn't stand seeing another woman.' \"\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-174\">\n    Petitioner frequently carried a knife on his person.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-175\">\n    The essential feature of a conduct disorder is \"a repetitive and persistent pattern of conduct in which either the basic rights of others or major age-appropriate societal norms or rules are violated.\" Am.

The record also indicates that Dr. McDaniel was aware PTSD was available as a diagnosis in the 1980s, and it was understood that the stress Petitioner suffered and his state of mind in the days preceding the stabbing supported a diagnosis of PTSD at the time of her initial psychiatric diagnoses.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"7\">\n   <p id=\"p-179\">\n    The facts agreed to in Petitioner's March 13, 1985 plea proceeding reflect that prior to stabbing Ms. Gibson: (1) one of Ms. Gibson's neighbors observed Petitioner walking towards Ms. Gibson's apartment, the neighbor had a brief conversation with him, and then watched him continue to head toward Ms. Gibson's apartment; (2) Petitioner knocked on another witness's door, and when she answered, he asked if the man of the house was home, and when the witness's husband appeared, Petitioner mumbled about being at the wrong house and left; (3) minutes after Petitioner left her apartment, the same witness heard police and ambulance sirens on the way to Ms. Gibson's apartment; and (4) Petitioner knocked on Ms. Gibson's door and told her he had a package to deliver and that she had to sign for it.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"8\">\n   <p id=\"p-180\">\n    The facts agreed to in Petitioner's March 13, 1985 plea proceeding also reflect that after he stabbed Ms. Gibson: (1) Petitioner was observed by several witnesses running from the apartment toward the Chartley Shopping Center, \"wearing grey shorts, a blue vest-type jacket, tennis shoes and carrying a brown paper bag[;]\" (2) Petitioner entered a nearby deli and used the deli's bathroom, leaving the bloody bag outside, but retrieving it after he finished; (3) Petitioner proceeded to a nearby automotive shop and asked for a new bag, but the shop did not have bags, so he left; (4) Petitioner was then observed removing his jacket, placing cans into his vest, and throwing the bag into a nearby yard; (5) Petitioner went to a nearby home and \"out of breath and sweating,\" carrying cat food in his vest, and not wearing a shirt or tennis shoes, asked the couple for a new bag because his had broken; and (6) while in the home, he asked the couple if they knew the back way to his home without having to go on Reisterstown Road. Dr. McDaniel also acknowledged in her deposition that Petitioner was aware of his actions, and was acting deliberately, when he \"pick[ed] up the bag, carr[ied] it out of Ms. Gibson's home, [ran] through the field, [went] into a store, wash[ed] his hands, dispos[ed] of the bloody bag, [took] the cat food, [went] to a friend's house, ask[ed] for directions to his house, a back way so he [didn't] have to walk on the roads.\"\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"9\">\n   <p id=\"p-181\">\n    \"It's...
