M., of his fifth amendment right to remain silent when the prosecutor twice noted during closing arguments that the defendant had not testified in his own defense. After a trial, a jury found the defendant guilty of multiple offenses, including sexual assault in the first degree, attempt to commit sexual assault in the first degree, and risk of injury to a child.\n  <footnotemark>\n   1\n  </footnotemark>\n  The trial court rendered judgment in accordance with the jury's verdict, and the defendant appealed to the Appellate Court. In his appeal, the defendant claimed, among other things, that the prosecutor's comments during closing argument\n  were improper because they infringed on his fifth amendment right to remain silent, depriving him of a fair trial. The Appellate Court agreed and reversed the judgment and remanded the case for a new trial.\n  <em>\n   State\n  </em>\n  v.\n  <em>\n   A.M.\n  </em>\n  ,\n  <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=156%20Conn.%20App.%20138\">\n   156 Conn.App. 138\n  </extracted-citation>\n  , 156,\n  <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=111%20A.3d%20974\">\n   111 A.3d 974\n  </extracted-citation>\n  (2015).

The defendant began dating the victim's mother in 2003 and moved in with the mother and her three children later that same year. In August, 2009, the victim, who was approximately ten years old at the time, told her mother's cousin that the defendant had squeezed her buttocks while she was washing dishes. The cousin alerted the victim's mother who then removed the defendant from the home. Approximately two weeks later, the victim's mother allowed the defendant back into the home. She did not call the police or alert the victim's father to the allegations. Seven months after the victim first disclosed her allegations of abuse, a member of the victim's extended family went to the victim's father and spoke to him about the allegations. Soon thereafter, the victim's father questioned the victim about the allegations, which she confirmed as true. Later that same day, he filed a report with Danbury Police Department.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   After receiving the report, the police commenced an investigation. Officers interviewed the victim, who confirmed that the defendant had been touching her inappropriately.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Police officers also interviewed the defendant, who gave oral and written statements to police discussing the allegations and denying that he had any inappropriate contact with the victim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   At the request of the police, the victim underwent a forensic interview, which was video recorded. In the interview, the victim described numerous incidents in which the defendant sexually abused her. She stated that several times when she was washing dishes, the defendant came up behind her and \"squeezed,\" \"smacked,\" and otherwise touched her buttocks while telling her that she was pretty. She also stated that on other occasions, the defendant squeezed, touched, and tried to lick her breasts. The victim recalled another occasion during which the defendant carried the victim into his room, told her he loved her and pulled down her pants. He then pulled open her legs and licked her genitals. Finally, the victim stated that the defendant once pinned her in the corner of a room, made her lay on the floor, pulled down her pants, and placed his penis on her buttocks. The defendant then attempted to penetrate the victim's anus with his penis, but was unable to do so. The victim initially told the forensic interviewer that these events occurred after August, 2009, when the defendant had returned after being kicked out of the home, but later, she clarified that these incidents occurred prior to August, 2009.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The victim also underwent a physical examination at the request of the police. The examination did not reveal any physical evidence of abuse. The examining physician later testified at trial, however, that the lack of physical evidence did not prove the absence of abuse based on the victim's description of how the abuse occurred.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On the basis of the information gathered during their investigation, the police obtained a warrant for the defendant's arrest, and the state later charged the defendant with numerous crimes relating to sexual assault and risk of injury to a child.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   At trial, the victim testified about the incidents in which the defendant grabbed her buttocks. At one point\n   during her testimony, the victim stated that the defendant had squeezed her buttocks six or seven times. Subsequently, she testified that he had done so only two or three times. When the prosecutor questioned the victim about the other instances of abuse-the defendant licking her genitals and attempting to penetrate her-the victim would not discuss them, saying, \"I don't want to talk about this. Can't.\" After the victim refused to discuss these incidents, the trial court admitted into evidence the video recording of the victim's forensic interview, which the jury was able to consider as substantive evidence of guilt pursuant to\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Whelan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"559597\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/200/743/#p753\">\n    200 Conn. 743\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 753,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=513%20A.2d%2086\">\n    513 A.2d 86\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , cert. denied,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6502338,6503652,6503432,6503134,6503325,6503216,6503540,6502614,6502713,6502525,6502425\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/479/994/\">\n    479 U.S. 994\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=107%20S.%20Ct.%20597\">\n    107 S.Ct. 597\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=93%20L.%20Ed.%202d%20598\">\n    93 L.Ed.2d 598\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1986). The portion of the video recording played at trial included the victim's descriptions of the incidents that she was unwilling to testify about at trial. Defense counsel was able to extensively cross-examine the victim about the allegations, including those made during the forensic interview and depicted in the video recording.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The state presented expert testimony to explain why the victim's recollection of when the sexual abuse occurred might have varied. The state's expert, Larry M. Rosenberg, a clinical psychologist, testified that children view and experience time differently than adults. Rosenberg also testified that the effect of trauma on memory is commonly to make it less accurate. Noting that the victim was only approximately ten years old at the time of the assaults, Rosenberg testified that children between the ages of eight and ten years old were not as capable of the abstract\n   reasoning and enhanced judgment possessed by adolescents, and though they could be more suggestible, they were less likely to make false reports than adolescents.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In his defense, the defendant presented witnesses to challenge the victim's credibility. The defendant primarily relied upon the testimony of the victim's mother, who\n   testified regarding the defendant's positive character traits and her disbelief that he would have committed these crimes-testimony that the state impeached with evidence of the defendant's history of violence toward her and other women. The defendant also presented his own expert who testified, contrary to the state's expert, that a ten year old child's memory skills are the same as an adult's, and that such a child would remember traumatic events as clearly as other memories, if not better. The defendant did not testify at trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   After the close of evidence, the state and defense counsel gave closing arguments to the jury. During the state's rebuttal argument, the prosecutor twice remarked to the jury that the defendant had not testified.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The prosecutor made the first remark while she reviewed the contents of the written statements that the defendant gave to the police, which had been admitted into evidence during trial. After summarizing portions of the testimony from the victim's mother, the prosecutor turned her attention to the defendant's statements to the police, telling the jury: \"This is the other thing. Counsel did not present his client to testify. That's their right guaranteed by the constitution if any of us were accused. But there is evidence as to things [the defendant] said. His sworn statement. Also, testimony by a couple of police officers as to what he said to them, and that's before you.\" The prosecutor then discussed portions of the defendant's statements to the police, before returning to discuss additional portions of the testimony of the victim's mother and arguing that her testimony lacked credibility.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Thereafter, the prosecutor again turned her attention to the defendant's statements to the police, this time to argue that they also lacked credibility. Specifically, the prosecutor stated: \"You've got to look at the credibility\n   of the defendant as well. I mean, he didn't testify. Again, that's his right, but there are some statements that are contained in the evidence. One [of] which that I've just referred to was his sworn statement as well as some statements by the police that he made the night he was arrested. Statements like, 'I've never seen her naked.' Three year olds in the house? We're all parents. Come on, never? Never. Never touched or tickled her ever. Really? Does that make sense?\" The prosecutor then went on to point out inconsistencies within the defendant's own statements and between the defendant's statements and some of the testimony given at trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Defense counsel did not object to either of the prosecutor's comments about the defendant's failure to testify, either during or after the state's argument. After the state's rebuttal argument, counsel did, however, make an unrelated objection about a different aspect of the prosecutor's rebuttal argument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   After resolving the unrelated objection, the court then instructed the jury on the law that applied to the case. Although the defendant had not objected to the prosecutor's comments, the court's charge nevertheless included the following instruction about the defendant's decision not to testify, as required by General Statutes \u00a7 54-84(b) : \"Now, the defendant has elected not to testify in this particular case. An accused has the right and the option to testify\n   or not to testify at his or her own trial, and is under no obligation to testify. He has a constitutional right that is protected by the [United States constitution] as well as the Connecticut [constitution] not to testify, and you may draw no unfavorable inferences from the defendant's choice not to testify in this particular instance.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   After receiving the court's instructions, the jury retired to deliberate and ultimately returned a verdict\n   finding the defendant guilty of all but one charge. The trial court thereafter rendered judgment in accordance with the jury's verdict, issuing a total effective sentence of twenty years of imprisonment, execution suspended after twelve years, followed by twenty years of probation with special conditions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The defendant appealed from the judgment of the trial court to the Appellate Court, claiming, among other things, that the prosecutor's references to the defendant's decision not to testify were improper and deprived him of his right to a fair trial.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Appellate Court agreed with the defendant and reversed the trial court's judgment.\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    A.M.\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=156%20Conn.%20App.%20138\">\n    156 Conn.App. at 148-49, 156\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=111%20A.3d%20974\">\n    111 A.3d 974\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . We granted the state's petition for certification on the following issue: \"Did the Appellate Court properly determine that certain comments made by the prosecutor amounted to prosecutorial improprieties and that such improprieties deprived the defendant of his due process rights to a fair trial?\"\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    A.M.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=317%20Conn.%20910\">\n    317 Conn. 910\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=116%20A.3d%20309\">\n    116 A.3d 309\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2015). On appeal to this court, the state claims that the Appellate Court improperly concluded that the prosecutor's comments were improper. The state also contends that even if the comments were improper, they were harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   As a threshold matter, we must revise the certified question and clarify the proper standard of review. The Appellate Court treated the defendant's claim as implicating his general due process right to a fair trial rather than as a claim arising under the fifth amendment right to remain silent. The Appellate Court thus decided the defendant's appeal using the due process standard for prosecutorial misconduct claims from\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Wil\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    liams\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"501421\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/204/523/#p540\">\n    204 Conn. 523\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 540,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=529%20A.2d%20653\">\n    529 A.2d 653\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1987), to conclude that the prosecutor's comments in the present case deprived the defendant of his due process right to a fair trial.\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    A.M.\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=156%20Conn.%20App.%20138\">\n    156 Conn.App. at 156\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=111%20A.3d%20974\">\n    111 A.3d 974\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . We have previously clarified, however, that the\n   <em>\n    Williams\n   </em>\n   standard applies only when a defendant claims that a prosecutor's conduct did not infringe on a specific constitutional right, but nevertheless deprived the defendant of his general due process right to a fair trial.\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Payne\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12174344\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/303/538/#p562\">\n    303 Conn. 538\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 562-63,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=34%20A.3d%20370\">\n    34 A.3d 370\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2012). For example, in\n   <em>\n    Williams\n   </em>\n   , the defendant argued that the prosecutor's comments deprived him of a fair trial because the prosecutor unfairly expressed his personal opinions about a witness' credibility and appealed to the passions and emotions of the jurors.\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Williams\n   </em>\n   , supra, at 540-41,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=529%20A.2d%20653\">\n    529 A.2d 653\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . There was no claim in\n   <em>\n    Williams\n   </em>\n   that the prosecutor's comments infringed an enumerated constitutional right, and, therefore, the court applied the general due process standard for prosecutorial impropriety claims.

The state argues that a prosecutor's statements violate the fifth amendment only if they\n   \" 'naturally and necessarily' \" imply to the jury that it should draw an adverse inference and infer guilt from the defendant's silence. According to the state, the prosecutor's comments in the present case did not violate the fifth amendment because the comments did not naturally and necessarily ask the jury to infer the defendant's guilt from the defendant's silence, but were made to remind the jury that although the defendant had not testified, the jury still had evidence of his statements before it that it could consider. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   First, the state's reliance on the \"naturally and necessarily\" test is misplaced. The \"naturally and necessarily\" standard applies only when it is unclear whether the prosecutor's comments at issue referred to the defendant's failure to testify, not when the prosecutor makes comments that explicitly refer to the defendant's silence.

By reason of his [or her] office, [the prosecutor] usually exercises great influence upon jurors.

While the privilege of counsel in addressing the jury should not be too closely narrowed or unduly hampered, it must never be used as a license to state, or to comment upon, or to suggest an inference from, facts not in evidence, or to present matters which the\n   jury [has] no right to consider.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Singh,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"360131\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/259/693/#p701\">\n    259 Conn. 693\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 701-702,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=793%20A.2d%20226\">\n    793 A.2d 226\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2002). With that proviso in mind, we now turn to the\n   <em>\n    Williams\n   </em>\n   factors for guidance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   First, as we noted previously, there is no question that the comments of the prosecutor were not invited by either the argument or conduct of defense counsel. Second, the remarks of the prosecutor were particularly severe. The state argues that the prosecutor's remarks were not of such a character that the jury would \"naturally and necessarily\" have taken them to be an adverse comment on the defendant's failure to testify. It argues that their context diluted any impropriety and demonstrated a purpose unrelated to the impropriety, namely, to focus on the statements given by the defendant to the police. We disagree. The statements of the prosecutor were particularly severe in this case because the prosecutor, as an officer of the court, violated a state statute, \u00a7 54-84(a), by commenting on the fact that the defendant did not testify, in open court, and did it on two occasions. The prosecutor then went on to tell the jurors that they could evaluate the credibility of the defendant through the statements he gave to the police, yet the only charge that the judge gave regarding credibility related to witnesses who testified.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   In spite of the prosecutor's\n   comments asking the jurors to judge the defendant's credibility by the statements he gave to the\n   police, the jury was instructed by the judge that credibility related to witnesses who testified. Thus, the prosecutor, through her statements on credibility, was reminding the jurors again that the defendant did not testify. The state argues that the fact that the defense counsel did not object to the prosecutor's comments, either during the prosecutor's argument or afterward, weighs heavily in any analysis of the harmfulness of the statements. We acknowledge that the failure to object on the part of defense counsel is certainly a factor to consider. We note that, in nearly all cases where defense counsel fails to object to and request a specific curative instruction in response to a prosecutorial impropriety, especially an impropriety that we do not consider to be particularly egregious, and the court's general jury instruction addresses that impropriety, we have held that the court's general instruction cures the impropriety.

Therefore, we conclude that the egregiousness of the remarks in this case were equal to, if not greater than, the remarks in both\n   <em>\n    Angel T.\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Maguire.\n   </em>\n   Any curative instruction should have been immediately given by the trial judge, and the general jury instruction, as we discuss hereinafter, was insufficient to cure the impropriety. The prosecutor, an officer of the court, twice violated a state statute prohibiting her from commenting on the defendant's failure to testify. Therefore, we hold that the remarks were egregious and were not cured by the general jury instructions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Third, we turn to the frequency of the prosecutor's remarks. Although it may be argued that the prosecutor only mentioned the defendant's failure to testify on two occasions, in our opinion, the violation of a specific state statute forbidding the comments means that two occasions of such violations is two too many. Indeed, we could not condone even one violation of such an extreme nature. Therefore, we conclude that, given the context of the remarks, they were frequent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Fourth, we turn to the centrality of the impropriety to the critical issues in the case. It is not contested that the prosecutorial impropriety in the present case went directly to the central issue, namely, credibility. The central issue for the jury was whether it would believe the allegations of the victim, particularly when there was no physical evidence. As this court previously has recognized, \"[b]ecause there was no independent physical evidence of the assault and no other witnesses to corroborate [the victim's] testimony, her credibility was crucial to successful prosecution of the case.\"\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Ritrovato,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5728849\" index=\"101\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/280/36/#p57\">\n    280 Conn. 36\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 57,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"102\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=905%20A.2d%201079\">\n    905 A.2d 1079\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2006) ; see also\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Iban C.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3152146\" index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/275/624/#p641\">\n    275 Conn. 624\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 641-42,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"104\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=881%20A.2d%201005\">\n    881 A.2d 1005\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2005) (when there was no physical or medical evidence of abuse and no eyewitness testimony other than victim's testimony, victim's credibility was central\n   to state's case).

Similarly, in the present case, the prosecutorial improprieties focused the jury's attention on the defendant's failure to take the stand to deny his guilt and, therefore, improperly bolstered the testimony of the victim. The credibility of the defendant and the victim were particularly central to the present case because there was no physical evidence, no eyewitness testimony and the victim's testimony was inconsistent regarding the incidences of abuse. Therefore, we conclude, as we did in\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Maguire,\n   </em>\n   supra, at 561-62,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"113\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=78%20A.3d%20828\">\n    78 A.3d 828\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , that because, in the present case, the state's charges rested entirely on the\n   credibility of the victim, the comments of the prosecutor tended to diminish the credibility of the defendant and to bolster the victim's credibility.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Fifth, we examine the strength of the state's case. This court repeatedly has recognized that \"a sexual assault case lacking physical evidence is not particularly strong, especially when the victim is a minor.\"\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v\n   <em>\n    .

Furthermore, as this court explained in\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Maguire\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"117\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=310%20Conn.%20535\">\n    310 Conn. at 561\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"118\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=78%20A.3d%20828\">\n    78 A.3d 828\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \"the state's case was not particularly strong. Significantly, there was no physical evidence of abuse, and there was no eyewitness testimony other than that of the victim, whose testimony at times was both equivocal and vague.\" In fact, this court has previously determined that when there is no physical evidence to support the allegations of sexual assault, the significance of the prosecutorial impropriety increased considerably. \"[A]lthough there exists evidence in the present case supporting the defendant's conviction despite the lack of direct physical evidence linking the defendant to the sexual assault of the victim-namely, the victim's testimony and the testimony of her mother and cousin-without independent physical evidence to prove that the defendant sexually assaulted [the victim], or even that [the victim] had been sexually assaulted at all, the significance of the [prosecutor's] improper conduct increases considerably.\"\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Angel T.,\n   </em>\n   supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4145535\" index=\"119\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/292/262/#p291\">\n    292 Conn. at 293\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"120\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=973%20A.2d%201207\">\n    973 A.2d 1207\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Similar to the circumstances in\n   <em>\n    Angel T.,\n   </em>\n   in the present case, there was no physical evidence linking the defendant to the sexual assault. There were also inconsistent statements made by the victim, and, in fact, the victim refused to answer certain questions during her direct\n   testimony. The only other evidence on point concerned the defendant's statements to the police wherein he denied that any of the incidents occurred or if something did happen, it was an accidental\n   brushing. Considering the totality of the circumstances and the evidence adduced at trial, we conclude that the state's case was not particularly strong.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   The last\n   <em>\n    Williams\n   </em>\n   factor involves the strength of the curative measures taken by the court. The state argues that the court's charge to the jury that it could not consider the defendant's failure to testify in its deliberations cured any defect in the prosecutor's argument. We are not persuaded. As we noted previously, no curative instruction was given at the time the prosecutor uttered the remarks. In\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Maguire,\n   </em>\n   supra,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"121\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=310%20Conn.%20535\">\n    310 Conn. at 561\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"122\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=78%20A.3d%20828\">\n    78 A.3d 828\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , we held that the general instructions to the jury were not enough when \"[a]lthough the trial court charged the jury in its final instructions that the law prohibits the prosecutor from offering her personal opinion as to the credibility of any witness, the trial court gave no curative instructions at the time of the improper remarks, which, in our view, were relatively severe ....\" Similarly, in the present case, the prosecutor's remarks not only were severe but also constituted both a statutory and constitutional violation, therefore, the judge's charge, which did not reference the specific remarks but was general in nature, was ineffectual and did not cure the impropriety of the prosecutor's remarks. The remarks were so egregious that, in the absence of a strong curative instruction at the time when the remarks were made, no general charge would have sufficed. Therefore, we conclude that the curative remarks made in the jury charge in the form of a general statement based on the accused's failure to testify, was insufficient in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   In our analysis regarding whether the state has proven that the remarks were harmless beyond a reasonable\n   doubt, we acknowledge that the jury found the defendant guilty of eight of the nine counts with which he was charged. Our case law does suggest that in the absence of evidence that the jury disregarded any of the court's instructions, we presume that the jury followed the instructions.\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Ancona,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"967031\" index=\"123\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/256/214/#p219\">\n    256 Conn. 214\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 219,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"124\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=772%20A.2d%20571\">\n    772 A.2d 571\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2001). It may be argued that the fact that the jury acquitted the defendant on one of the charges supports a conclusion that the jury was able to analyze all of the charges and weigh the evidence against the defendant, rather than totally condemn him for his failure to testify. We note, however, that a similar argument was rejected in\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Maguire\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"125\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=310%20Conn.%20535\">\n    310 Conn. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   562-63 n.13,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"126\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=78%20A.3d%20828\">\n    78 A.3d 828\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , wherein the defendant was found not guilty on two counts. Although in our analysis we do credit the state for this conclusion, on closer examination it is not as persuasive as it initially may appear. The defendant was charged with a total of nine counts, eight of which related to various types of sexual assault and risk of injury charges for his alleged conduct relating to the victim. The ninth charge did not. The ninth charge alleged, in relevant part, that the defendant \"wilfully and unlawfully caused and permitted a child under the age of sixteen to be placed in a situation that the morals of said child were likely to be impaired, to wit: witnessing [the defendant] being violent towards the child's mother ....\" As the prosecutor stated in his closing argument: \"Now, count nine is the one count that's a little bit different. That is a risk of injury under a-it's the same statute number, which is \u00a7 53-21 (a) (1), but it has to do with the child witnessing domestic violence and-not domestic violence, but violent actions by the defendant in the home.\" The prosecutorial impropriety in the present case improperly impugned the defendant's credibility for not testifying and bolstered the victim's credibility as it related to the central issue in the case-whether the sexual assaults\n   had taken place. Indeed, there were no statements made by the defendant to the police regarding the ninth count. Therefore, the prosecutor's improper comments would not have affected the jury's deliberation on that count. Accordingly, the fact that the defendant was acquitted on an unrelated charge is not relevant to the consideration of whether the constitutional and statutory violation harmed the defendant on the charges in which the jury was required to pit his testimony, through his statements to the police, against the testimony of the victim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Therefore, we conclude that all of the\n   <em>\n    Williams\n   </em>\n   factors weigh in favor of the defendant. Similar to the situation in\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Maguire,\n   </em>\n   supra,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"127\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=310%20Conn.%20535\">\n    310 Conn. at 561\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"128\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=78%20A.3d%20828\">\n    78 A.3d 828\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , the only factor in the\n   <em>\n    Williams\n   </em>\n   analysis favorable to the state is defense counsel's failure to object to the statements. This failure, however, is overcome by the egregiousness of the statements. Furthermore, we have credited the state with the fact that the jury found the defendant guilty of eight out of the nine charges. However, due to the difference between the first eight charges on which the defendant was found guilty, and the ninth charge on which he was acquitted, we do not find this fact to be either strongly in favor of the state or dispositive of the case and we arrive at a similar conclusion as the court did in\n   <em>\n    Maguire,\n   </em>\n   when the defendant was found not guilty on two charges.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"129\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=78%20A.3d%20828\">\n    Id.,\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at 562-63 n.13,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"130\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=78%20A.3d%20828\">\n    78 A.3d 828\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Therefore, we are convinced that the state has failed to meet its burden of proof that the statements made by the prosecutor were harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   The judgment of the Appellate Court is affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   In this opinion ROGERS, C.

M., is entitled to reversal of his convictions as a result of statements made by the assistant state's attorney (prosecutor) during closing arguments at the defendant's trial. The majority concludes that these statements, in which the prosecutor noted that the defendant had not testified, violated General Statutes \u00a7 54-84, as well as the defendant's fifth amendment right to remain silent,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   and that these violations were not harmless. Although I agree that the statements violated \u00a7 54-84, I cannot conclude that the statements violated the defendant's fifth amendment rights because they did not \"suggest [that the] defendant's silence [was] evidence of\n   <em>\n    guilt\n   </em>\n   .\" (Emphasis in original; internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Portuondo\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Agard\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9508173\" index=\"131\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/529/61/#p69\">\n    529 U.S. 61\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 69,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9508173\" index=\"132\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/529/61/#p69\">\n    120 S.Ct. 1119\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9508173\" index=\"133\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/529/61/#p69\">\n    146 L.Ed.2d 47\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2000). Nevertheless, even if the prosecutor's statements did violate the fifth amendment, I am convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that any such violation was insignificant and had no impact on the trial, and thus was harmless. Although the prosecutor referenced the fact that the defendant had not testified, she did not ask or imply that the jury hold the defendant's decision not to testify against him, and the prosecutor did not otherwise convey to the jury anything it had not already observed itself. Indeed, the absence of any prejudice in this matter is demonstrated by the lack of any objection from defense counsel to the prosecutor's comments or any request\n   for a specific curative instruction at trial. Moreover, any possibility that the jury might use the defendant's silence against him as a result of the prosecutor's comments was dispelled by the court's instructions, in which the court expressly directed the jury that it could\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   infer guilt\n   from the defendant's decision not to testify. To conclude that the jury nevertheless misused the defendant's silence in the face of this instruction requires a conclusion that the jury disregarded the instruction. We presume, however, that the jury followed the court's instructions in the absence of evidence to the contrary; see, e.g.,\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Ancona\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"967031\" index=\"134\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/256/214/#p219\">\n    256 Conn. 214\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 219,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"135\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=772%20A.2d%20571\">\n    772 A.2d 571\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2001) ; and, in the present case, there is no such evidence to the contrary. Finally, although the majority viewed the state's case as weak-presumably making the jury more susceptible to using improper considerations to decide the case-a review of the record dispels any such conclusion. For these reasons, I am convinced that the prosecutor's statements had no impact on the outcome of the trial and, thus, were harmless. Therefore, I respectfully dissent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   In analyzing the comments in the present case, I am convinced that they did not influence the jury's decision. Even if the prosecutor violated the defendant's fifth amendment rights, the defendant is still not entitled to a new trial if the state establishes that the violation was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. See, e.g.,\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Payne\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12174344\" index=\"136\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/303/538/#p562\">\n    303 Conn. 538\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 563-64,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"137\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=34%20A.3d%20370\">\n    34 A.3d 370\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2012). \"[I]t is the duty of a reviewing court to consider the trial record as a whole and to ignore errors that are harmless, including most constitutional violations ....\" (Citations omitted.)\n   <em>\n    United States\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Hasting\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11298852\" index=\"138\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/461/499/#p509\">\n    461 U.S. 499\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 509,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11298852\" index=\"139\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/461/499/#p509\">\n    103 S.Ct. 1974\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11298852\" index=\"140\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/461/499/#p509\">\n    76 L.Ed.2d 96\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1983). To determine whether the comments were harmful, we must determine whether the comments prejudiced the defendant. \"The question of whether the defendant has been prejudiced by prosecutorial [impropriety] ... depends on whether there is a reasonable likelihood that the jury's verdict would have been different absent the sum total of the improprieties.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Angel T\n   </em>\n   .,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4145535\" index=\"141\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/292/262/#p291\">\n    292 Conn. 262\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 287,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"142\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=973%20A.2d%201207\">\n    973 A.2d 1207\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2009). In determining whether the statements\n   had any impact on the outcome, the statements must be analyzed in the context of the trial as a whole.

The prosecutor did not ask the jury, explicitly or implicitly, to hold the defendant's silence against him but, instead, reminded the jury that it could consider the defendant's statements to the police in evaluating the defendant's credibility. Specifically, in the first statement at issue, the prosecutor stated: \"This is the other thing. Counsel did not present his client to testify. That's their right guaranteed by the constitution if any of us were accused. But there is evidence as to things that [the defendant] said. His sworn statement. Also, testimony by a couple of police officers as to what he said to them, and that's before you.\" In the second statement at issue, the prosecutor stated: \"You've got to look at the credibility of the defendant as well. I mean, he didn't testify. Again, that's his right, but there are some statements that are contained in the evidence. One [of] which that I've just referred to was his sworn statement as well as some statements by the police that he made the night he was arrested. Statements like, 'I've never seen her naked.' Three year olds in the house? We're all parents. Come on, never? Never? Never touched or tickled\n   her ever. Really? Does that make sense?\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   These statements, even if improper, were isolated and not egregious. The prosecutor never asked the jury to draw a negative inference from the defendant's failure to testify or suggested that the jury should draw a negative inference from his silence. Instead, the prosecutor's statements were meant to convey to the jury that, even though the defendant did not testify at trial, his statements to the police were contained in the record, and that the jury could use the statements to\n   assess the defendant's credibility. Apart from these two passing references, there were no other instances of prosecutorial impropriety, and the comments at issue were benign. \"[M]oreover ... [a defendant is not entitled to prevail when] the claimed [impropriety] was not blatantly egregious and merely consisted of isolated and brief episodes that did not reveal a pattern of conduct repeated throughout the trial.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Luster\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3668235\" index=\"145\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/279/414/#p446\">\n    279 Conn. at 442\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"146\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=902%20A.2d%20636\">\n    902 A.2d 636\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The prosecutor made no other allegedly improper statements during the trial, so her statements do not constitute a pattern of repeated conduct and thus do not warrant reversal.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Furthermore, the prosecutor did not tell the jurors anything that they had not already perceived. The statements were made during closing arguments, and, at that time, the jury would have been well aware that the defendant had not testified and that no testimony from the defendant would be forthcoming.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   The prosecutor's comments would not have influenced the jury for another reason, namely, that they conveyed precisely the same information that the trial court provided to the jury in its instructions on the law. In its jury charge, the trial court expressly reminded the jury that \"the defendant has elected not to testify in this particular case,\" that the defendant \"is under no obligation to testify,\" and that \"[h]e has a constitutional right that is protected by the [United States] as well as the Connecticut constitutions not to testify ....\" The prosecutor's comments mirrored this instruction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Contrary to the majority's assertion, the prosecutor's comments in this case are nothing like the comments in the cases on which the majority relies, in which reversible error was found. For example, in\n   <em>\n    Griffin\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    California\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1524757\" index=\"147\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/380/609/#p615\">\n    380 U.S. 609\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 610-11, 615,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1524757\" index=\"148\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/380/609/#p615\">\n    85 S.Ct. 1229\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1524757\" index=\"149\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/380/609/#p615\">\n    14 L.Ed.2d 106\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1965), both the prosecutor and the trial court told the jury that it could draw inferences of guilt from the defendant's silence. In the present case, the prosecutor merely sought to draw attention to the defendant's statements that were contained in the record. The prosecutor made no assertion that the jury should hold the defendant's failure to testify against him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   The majority incorrectly asserts that \"the egregiousness of the remarks in this case [was] equal to, if not greater than\" the egregiousness of the prosecutor's remarks in\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Maguire\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"150\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=310%20Conn.%20535\">\n    310 Conn. 535\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"151\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=78%20A.3d%20828\">\n    78 A.3d 828\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2013). This case is nothing like\n   <em>\n    Maguire\n   </em>\n   . In that case, this court granted a new trial to the defendant, Michael G. Maguire, because the prosecutor\n   repeatedly told the jury that Maguire was asking the jury to condone child abuse and to find that child abuse that happens in secret is legal, and also told the jury that defense counsel was a liar. Id., at 555, 576,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"152\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=78%20A.3d%20828\">\n    78 A.3d 828\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In\n   <em>\n    Maguire\n   </em>\n   the prosecutor's remarks were meant to inflame the passions of the jurors, but, in the present case, the prosecutor's statements were merely an attempt to remind the jurors of the evidence in the record that they could consider.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   The majority also never explains how the prosecutor's statements in the present case were harmful. Instead, the majority concludes that the statements were severe simply because the statements violated the fifth amendment and \u00a7 54-84. The mere existence of a constitutional violation, however, is not indicative of harmful error. See, e.g.,\n   <em>\n    United States\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Hasting\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11298852\" index=\"153\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/461/499/#p509\">\n    461 U.S. at 509\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11298852\" index=\"154\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/461/499/#p509\">\n    103 S.Ct. 1974\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The majority never explains how the statements could have prejudiced the jury or even what\n   the prejudice is. In effect, the prosecutor stated to the jury that the defendant's credibility could still be assessed despite the fact that he failed to testify, which is the defendant's right, by considering his statements to the police. The two inferences that can be drawn from this are, one, the jury\n   <em>\n    cannot\n   </em>\n   assess the defendant's veracity from the fact that he failed to testify, and, two, the jury\n   <em>\n    can\n   </em>\n   assess the credibility of his statements to the police.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   The lack of any prejudicial effect is further demonstrated by defense counsel's failure to object to the statements at trial. If the prosecutor's statements were truly as severe as the majority would have us believe, surely, defense counsel would have moved for a mistrial\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   or at least would have objected to these statements. After all, counsel made another unrelated objection to the prosecutor's closing argument. The reason there was no objection is simple: no one perceived the statements as prejudicial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   When considering the impact of a prosecutor's improper comments, \"this court consider[s] it highly significant that defense counsel failed to object to any of the improper remarks, request curative instructions, or move for a mistrial. ... A failure to object demonstrates that defense counsel presumably [did] not view the alleged impropriety as prejudicial enough to jeopardize seriously the defendant's right to a fair trial.\" (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Luster\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3668235\" index=\"155\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/279/414/#p446\">\n    279 Conn. at 443\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"156\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=902%20A.2d%20636\">\n    902 A.2d 636\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; see also\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Angel T\n   </em>\n   ., supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4145535\" index=\"157\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/292/262/#p291\">\n    292 Conn. at 289\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"158\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=973%20A.2d%201207\">\n    973 A.2d 1207\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"because the defendant failed to object or to seek curative measures at trial ... this factor support[ed] the state's contention that the prosecutorial impropriety was not particularly severe\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Notably, after the prosecutor's rebuttal argument, defense counsel did make an unrelated objection after\n   the prosecutor showed the jury a trial transcript that had not been entered into evidence. Despite raising this objection to the state's rebuttal, counsel made no mention of the prosecutor's comments regarding the defendant's decision not to testify. This strongly suggests that defense counsel did not view either of the prosecutor's comments as being prejudicial to the defendant and, further, that the statements had no meaningful impact on the jury. See, e.g.,\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Lemon\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"519901\" index=\"159\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/248/652/#p665\">\n    248 Conn. 652\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 665,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"160\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=731%20A.2d%20271\">\n    731 A.2d 271\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1999) (lack of objection to statements later challenged on appeal is evidence that\n   counsel did not deem statements to be prejudicial when they were made).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   The majority places virtually no weight on defense counsel's failure to object to an impropriety that the majority would now have us believe was \"particularly egregious.\" Because we are able to review only a transcript of the words used at trial, we must rely on the parties' actions during the trial, and defense counsel's failure to object indicates that the prosecutor's comments had no discernible impact on those in the courtroom who witnessed the argument as it unfolded. The majority excuses defense counsel's failure to object by classifying the failure as a tactical decision. The majority claims that defense counsel may have chosen not to object because counsel did not wish to draw the jury's attention to the prosecutor's statements. There simply is no rational reason why competent counsel would have ignored these statements if they actually were \"particularly egregious.\" If defense counsel did not want to object in the presence of the jury because he thought that it would highlight the fact that the defendant did not testify, he could have objected after the jury left the courtroom. In fact, defense counsel\n   <em>\n    did object\n   </em>\n   to other aspects of the rebuttal argument\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   the jury left the courtroom. Therefore, defense counsel's failure to object is \" 'highly significant' \" evidence that the prosecutor's statements were not severe.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Luster\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3668235\" index=\"161\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/279/414/#p446\">\n    279 Conn. at 443\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"162\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=902%20A.2d%20636\">\n    902 A.2d 636\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Even if we assume that defense counsel chose not to object for some inconceivable tactical reason, appellate review of prosecutorial impropriety claims \"is not intended to provide an avenue for the tactical sandbagging of our trial courts but, rather, to address gross prosecutorial improprieties that clearly have deprived a criminal defendant of his right to a fair trial.\"\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Ceballos\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2636136\" index=\"163\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/266/364/#p414\">\n    266 Conn. 364\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 414-15,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"164\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=832%20A.2d%2014\">\n    832 A.2d 14\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2003).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Even if the prosecutor's comments could have caused harm, which they did not, the trial court's instructions dispelled that risk.

The court's instructions in the present case directly addressed the prosecutor's improper comments, unlike in the cases that the majority relies on, namely,\n   <em>\n    Angel T\n   </em>\n   . and\n   <em>\n    Maguire\n   </em>\n   , in which the jury instructions did not address all aspects of the prosecutorial improprieties.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   The jury instructions in the present case specifically addressed the defendant's\n   failure to testify, informing the jury that it was, as the prosecutor had stated, the defendant's constitutional right not to testify. The trial court also instructed the jury that it was not allowed to draw any adverse inference from the defendant's failure to testify. We do not assume, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, that jurors will ignore the court's instructions. See, e.g.,\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Ancona\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"967031\" index=\"174\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/256/214/#p219\">\n    256 Conn. at 219\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"175\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=772%20A.2d%20571\">\n    772 A.2d 571\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   The majority claims that \"no general charge would have sufficed\" because the remarks were \"so egregious ....\" For the foregoing reasons, I disagree with the majority's claim that the prosecutor's remarks were egregious. But for the fact that the comments were a technical violation of \u00a7 54-84, they were not improper at all, and, therefore, the court's general jury instruction completely cured the impropriety. The reason is simple: the jury instructions and the statements by the prosecutor were correct statements of the law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Finally, although the majority claims that the state's case was so weak that the prosecutor's statements likely impacted the jury's decision despite any curative\n   instructions, a review of the record belies such a conclusion. The majority contends that the prosecutor's statements were harmful because the state's case was weak and turned entirely on matters of credibility, such that the prosecutor's statements might have led the jury to discredit the defendant and to find him guilty. The majority, however, does not analyze the strength of the state's evidence in the present case. Instead, the majority cites\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Ceballos,\n   </em>\n   supra, 266 Conn. at 364,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"176\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=832%20A.2d%2014\">\n    832 A.2d 14\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , in which we observed that \"a child sexual abuse case lacking conclusive physical evidence, when the prosecution's case rests on the credibility of the victim ... is not particularly strong.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., at 416,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"177\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=832%20A.2d%2014\">\n    832 A.2d 14\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   I disagree that\n   <em>\n    Ceballos\n   </em>\n   supports the majority's broad contention, namely, that a lack of physical evidence necessarily makes the state's case so weak that it automatically weighs in favor of the defendant. In\n   <em>\n    Ceballos\n   </em>\n   , we also stated that the \"absence of conclusive physical evidence of sexual abuse does not automatically render [the state's] case weak ....\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"178\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=832%20A.2d%2014\">\n    Id.\n   </extracted-citation>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Moreover, my review of the trial evidence convinces me that the state's case was strong enough that the comments would not have influenced the jury's verdict or impacted the outcome of the proceedings. Although the outcome of the present case turned largely on the credibility of the victim's accusations and the defendant's denials, the state presented evidence to support the victim's credibility and additional evidence to impeach the truth of the defendant's statements to the police and the defendant's general character.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   The majority ignores the fact that the jury had a substantial opportunity to evaluate the victim's credibility on the basis of her in-court demeanor. The victim testified on three separate occasions, and defense counsel was able to cross-examine her regarding\n   all of the\n   allegations that she had made during her forensic interview. Defense counsel questioned the victim about each specific allegation of abuse contained in the video-recorded interview, and the victim answered all of defense counsel's numerous questions. The state also presented expert testimony indicating that it was not unusual for a young child to be uncertain about precisely when she had been abused.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Later, defense counsel called the victim's mother to testify regarding the defendant's good character, but much of her testimony was contradictory. The victim's mother testified that she had never seen the defendant \"be fresh around women\" but later admitted that the defendant had a history of violent behavior toward women. Specifically, she acknowledged that she had once called the police after the defendant punched her in the face. She also testified that, on a separate occasion, another woman had told her that the defendant was having an affair; when the defendant found out, he went to the woman's home and smashed her car windshield.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   The testimony of the victim's mother was also inconsistent with the defendant's own statements to the police. In his sworn statement to the police, the defendant claimed that he never had been alone in the home with the victim since she made her first allegations. Contrary to the defendant's claim that he was never in the home alone with the victim after August, 2009, the victim's mother stated that there were still times when the defendant was alone with the victim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   The prosecutor also pointed out that the defendant's own statements to the police were contradictory. The defendant claimed that he had not hugged or kissed the victim since she was \"very young ....\" In the very same statement, he said that, after the victim's mother had kicked him out of her home, he returned\n   to confront the victim about her allegations. The defendant then stated that, upon doing so, the victim apologized to him,\n   <em>\n    they hugged\n   </em>\n   , and then went to the mall where he and the victim held hands.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Considering that defense counsel failed to object to the prosecutor's comments and that the trial court instructed the jury that it could not consider the defendant's decision not to testify, I am convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that the prosecutor's comments did not impact the jury's decision. The jury had before it ample evidence from which to consider the credibility of the victim and the strength of the defendant's case. The jury was able to observe the victim's demeanor in court during her testimony, including during extensive cross-examination. Additionally, the state presented evidence to discredit the victim's mother's description of the defendant's character and to impeach the credibility of the defendant's own statements to the police.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   For all of the foregoing reasons, I would conclude that the prosecutor's statements did not impact the outcome of the trial and, thus, were harmless. Accordingly I would reverse the judgment of the Appellate Court, and, therefore, I respectfully dissent.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-81\">\n    Although the defendant did not preserve his prosecutorial impropriety claim by objecting at trial, such claims are nevertheless reviewable on appeal.
