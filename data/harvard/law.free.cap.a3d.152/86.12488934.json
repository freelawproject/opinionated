The habeas court dismissed his petition for a writ of habeas corpus pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 23-29 (2) on the ground that it failed to state a cause of action upon which relief could be granted. Because a \"petitioner's classification as a security risk group member does not implicate a liberty interest\" that is \"sufficient to invoke the subject\n   matter jurisdiction of the habeas court\"; (internal quotation marks omitted)\n   <em>\n    Rodriguez\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Commissioner of Correction\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=159%20Conn.%20App.%20162\">\n    159 Conn.App. 162\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 166,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=122%20A.3d%20709\">\n    122 A.3d 709\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2015) ; we conclude that the habeas court properly dismissed the petition for a writ of habeas corpus. On this point, jurists of reason cannot differ. Accordingly, we further conclude that the habeas court did not err in denying the petitioner's petition for certification to appeal.
