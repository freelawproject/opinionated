Kor-Ko, Ltd. (Kor-Ko), the principal Petitioner in the present case,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   seeks to overturn the Maryland Department of the Environment's (MDE) grant of a construction permit to Maryland Crematory, LLC (MC), to operate a crematorium in the same commercial/industrial park building in Millersville, Maryland, containing Kor-Ko's business operations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   MC submitted in 2011 a permit application to the MDE for the construction of a human remains crematory incinerator at 408 Headquarters Drive, Suite 10, Millersville, Maryland 21108. The air emissions from the incineration of human remains may produce a panoply of toxic pollutants, including, among other contaminants, arsenic, chromium, dioxins, and mercury. On 27 October 2011, the MDE notified MC that its original application submission failed to quantify the crematory's future toxic output or show that the emissions \"will not unreasonably endanger public health,\" pursuant to Code of Maryland Regulations (COMAR) 26.11.15.04 and 26.11.15.06. The MDE allowed MC 90 days to supplement its application.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   MC submitted a Toxic Air Pollutant Analysis on 7 December 2011, but the MDE found the supplemented application deficient, as memorialized in a letter to MC dated 27 December 2011. MC re-supplemented its application in January and February of 2012 with additional information, but, again, the MDE notified MC that its application remained lacking. On 21 March 2012, however, the MDE pivoted somewhat. In a letter to MC, the MDE concluded that MC \"provided an overall sufficient toxics analysis within the 90 day requirement.\n   <sup>\n    [\n   </sup>\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   <sup>\n    ]\n   </sup>\n   The 90 day clock is stopped[,]\" but that some details of the application \"still need[ed] to be addressed[.]\" In a follow-up\n   document, the MDE explained that, despite MC's application remaining \"inadequate with regards to dioxin and furan emissions,\" the MDE \"was ultimately able to resolve this ... inadequacy of the compliance demonstration\" by performing its own calculations as to the quantitative and qualitative models for these toxins.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The MDE reached and published a Tentative Determination, on 9 August 2012, to issue the permit because the agency expected the crematory would meet the relevant air quality requirements. Following an advertised legislative-style public hearing held by the MDE on 6 September 2012, opponents of the proposed issuance of the permit (including Petitioners) submitted, on 13 November 2012, supplemental written comments.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Combining hypothetical toxin dispersion and concentration data with information from an EPA database about the specific contaminants emitted by human remains incinerators, the MDE compared (in a modeling exercise) the maximum concentrations of MC's anticipated pollutants with screening levels determined safe for human exposure. The MDE's screening process found that the predicted pollutant concentrations, modeled at ground level at the boundary of the commercial park in which MC proposed to locate its business, would not endanger unreasonably human health. URS Corp., a consultant hired by opponents of the proposed permit action, calculated independently that the anticipated pollutants' dispersal and concentration levels, measured at the rooftop air handlers height of MC's building (in which Kor-Ko was an existing tenant) within the commercial park, several pollutants, particularly arsenic and mercury, would reach concentrations that\n   exceed the MDE's threshold levels for safety for human health.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Effective 24 July 2013, the MDE issued the construction permit, together with its Final Determination and responses to some of the previously received public comments, including the URS report.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   On 16 August 2013, Kor-Ko and other parties to the agency proceedings sought judicial review in the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County of the MDE's Final Determination to issue the permit. In an order entered on 26 September 2014, the court remanded the matter to the MDE to analyze specifically MC's potential emissions' toxicity to people in adjacent buildings in the office park that use rooftop air handlers. On the MDE's direct appeal, the Court of Special Appeals reversed, in an unreported opinion, remanding the case to the circuit court with instructions to affirm the MDE's issuance of the permit. Kor-Ko filed electronically, on 21 April 2016, its petition for writ of certiorari.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   On 23 June 2016, we granted Kor-Ko's petition to consider potentially the following questions, as formulated by Kor-Ko:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   The overriding question presented in this action for judicial review is whether MDE erred by issuing a permit to a facility that will unreasonably endanger human health.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   COMAR \u00a7 26.11.15.06.

COMAR 26.11.02.02B. Pursuant to COMAR 26.11.15 and 26.11.16, the MDE regulates Toxic Air Pollutants (TAPs) and provides related procedural requirements to prevent unreasonable danger to human health, among other objectives. COMAR 26.11.15.06, Ambient Impact Requirement, subsection A(1), reads as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   A. Requirements for New Installations, Sources, or Premises.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   (1) Except as provided in \u00a7 A(2) of this regulation, a person may not construct, modify, or operate, or cause to be constructed, modified, or operated, any new installation or source without first demonstrating to the satisfaction of the Department using procedures established in this chapter that total allowable emissions from the premises of each toxic air pollutant discharged by the new installation or source will not unreasonably endanger human health.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Permit applicants may satisfy this requirement by exemption, COMAR 26.11.15.03B(4) (not applicable in the present case), or by demonstrating compliance via \"a screening analysis or\n   second tier analysis,\" COMAR 26.11.15.07B(1), explained in COMAR 26.11.16.02 as a process of predicting the toxic and carcinogenic effects of the TAPs to be emitted by the source the applicant seeks to construct and operate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   In its Brief, the MDE describes its screening and modeling process as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   Under this approach, the Department sets the screening levels conservatively\n   to ensure that the emissions will not unreasonably [en]danger human health. More specifically, to establish the screening level for a particular pollutant, the Department usually takes a value that measures \"the airborne concentrations of a substance ... represent[ing] conditions to which nearly all workers may be exposed without adverse health effects,\" COMAR \u00a7 26.11.15.01B(18), and then further divides that already safe value by 100. COMAR \u00a7 26.11.16.03A(1). The applicant then uses an air-dispersion computer model approved by the Department to determine whether the ground level concentrations of the predicted emissions for each pollutant will be below the relevant screening level at different distances away from the crematory. COMAR \u00a7 26.11.16.02C(1)(a). The most conservative air-dispersion model, which was the model used in this case, is called SCREEN3.... If the projected emissions from the crematory do not exceed the screening levels, the permit applicant has complied with the ambient impact requirement.\n   <sup>\n    [\n   </sup>\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   <sup>\n    ]\n   </sup>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Kor-Ko argues that, by relying on toxin concentrations modeled at the boundary of the commercial park at ground level, but not within the commercial park (of which MC's and Kor-Ko's shared building is a part) at the level of rooftop air handlers, the MDE misinterpreted and misapplied unlawfully its own regulations' terms \"premises\" and \"ambient air,\" rendering thereby its permit issuance unsupported by substantial evidence, legally erroneous in substance and procedure, and arbitrary and capricious. The MDE answers that it interpreted and applied properly the terms \"premises\" and \"ambient air,\" and that, in the event we were to agree with Kor-Ko, we should remand the proceedings to the MDE, rather than invalidate the permit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

The MDE answers that the regulatory definition and agency interpretation of \"premises\" renders the boundary of the commercial park the proper locus for modeling, and that its screening levels applied at that point are conservative enough,\n   if met, to protect people inside the complex as well from unreasonable danger to their health.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   COMAR 26.11.15.06A(1), Ambient Impact Requirement, Requirements for New Installations, Sources, or Premises, states that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   a person may not construct, modify, or operate, or cause to be constructed, modified, or operated, any new installation or source without first demonstrating to the satisfaction of the Department using procedures established in this chapter that total allowable\n   <strong>\n    emissions from the premises\n   </strong>\n   of each toxic air pollutant discharged by the new installation or source will not unreasonably endanger human health.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   (emphasis added).

The MDE argues that such a definition coincides with \"the Department's interpretation that 'premises' extends to the real property boundary of property owned by a single owner[.]\" Whether Stone Snyder controls indeed the entire commercial park, the meaning of \"premises,\" as evidenced by this dictionary definition, could be interpreted reasonably to encompass the entire complex where the record reveals no internal lot lines depicting separate ownership within a common development.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Second, other regulations in the Air Quality regulatory subtitle bolster the MDE's interpretation by using synonymously\n   \"premises\" and \"property line.\" COMAR 26.11.15.03B(4) exempts prospective installations and sources from the ambient air regulations in COMAR 26.11.15.06 if their toxic emissions \"from a premises\" are below a certain threshold \"beyond the property line.\" Additionally, COMAR 26.11.06.08 states that \"[a]n installation or\n   <strong>\n    premises\n   </strong>\n   may not be operated or maintained in such a manner that a nuisance or air pollution is created[,]\" and\n   in a parallel regulation, COMAR 26.11.06.09, persons are prohibited from causing or permitting \"the discharge into the atmosphere of gases, vapors, or odors beyond the\n   <strong>\n    property line\n   </strong>\n   in such a manner that a nuisance or air pollution is created.\" (emphasis added). The use in these regulations of the term \"premises\" lends a whiff of reasonableness to the MDE's interpretation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   <sup>\n    ,\n   </sup>\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   Third, and of greatest potency here, the MDE argues that its interpretation of \"premises\" protects adequately the health of the tenants and employees in the MC/Kor-Ko building and other buildings in the commercial development. For non-cancerous toxins, the MDE's screening levels are set conservatively at 1/100th of their \"threshold limit value\" (TLV). COMAR 26.11.16.03A(1). The TLV of a given toxin is \"the airborne concentration of a substance that, according to the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH), represents conditions to which nearly all workers may be exposed without adverse effect[.]\" COMAR 26.11.15.01B(18). Additionally, similarly conservative formulae are provided to screen non-cancerous toxins that do not have a TLV. COMAR 26.11.16.03A(2). For carcinogenic effects, the MDE uses screening levels standardized to the following rubric: if a person were exposed to a toxin continuously for 70 years, it would increase the person's cancer risk by one in 100,000. COMAR 26.11.16.03B(1). The MDE believes that such conservative screening requirements prevent MC's future emissions from endangering unreasonably human\n   health-not only the health of humans beyond the commercial park, but also that of people working within the commercial complex.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Because we are reviewing the MDE's interpretation of its own regulations, \"we are especially mindful of that agency's expertise in its field.\"\n   <em>\n    Carven v.

Accordingly, we defer to the MDE's interpretation of \"premises\" and conclude that it is permissible legally, and neither arbitrary nor capricious, as applied via the MDE's decision to rely on the modeling and screening of toxin concentrations at the boundary\n   of the commercial park on the ground, rather than requiring modeling at the rooftops of any building within the complex.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

The MDE's appellate assertion that the EPA definition of \"ambient air\" controls, or, at the very least, coincides with, its interpretation of its ambient air regulations was, most likely, not a reason on which the agency relied in issuing the permit, because the record indicates that, at the time of the MDE's Final Determination, the MDE appeared to hold at arm's length the EPA definition. Although the MDE's post-hoc position on the relevance of the EPA definition was of little concern to the Court of Special Appeals, the MDE's original reasoning is not perfectly clear, at least in part because the Legislature did not require it to express its reasoning in written, detailed findings of fact and conclusions of law, but rather fostered a somewhat looser and elusive decisional process.

Indeed, although the majority opinion is well written and contains no mistakes in any of the applicable standards or case law, the Majority does not review the plain language of the relevant Code of Maryland Regulation (\"COMAR\") and the obvious intent of the regulations, and the Majority does not consider the practical outcome associated with adopting the MDE's interpretation.

And, COMAR 26.11.15.04A(2) states that emissions from new installations must be \"quantified in sufficient detail to determine whether\n   <strong>\n    the premises\n   </strong>\n   complies with the requirements of [the State's Air Quality Regulations].\" (Emphasis added). COMAR 26.11.01.01B(36) and COMAR 26.11.15.01B(12) define \"premises\" as \"all the installations or other sources that are located on contiguous or adjacent properties and that are under the control of one person or under common control of a group of persons.\" No Maryland case has addressed what the term \"premises\" means when applied in the context of these regulations, and, as the majority opinion recognizes, the MDE's interpretation of the term\n   \"premises\" is not a longstanding and consistent interpretation of the term.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Maj. Op. at 419-20 n.14, 152 A.3d at 852 n.14. The matter before the Court is one of first impression.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   Applying basic principles of regulatory construction, I would conclude that the MDE's interpretation of the term \"premises\" conflicts with the plain language of COMAR 26.11.15.06A(1), which clearly refers to \"premises\" as being the location of the new installation or source from which toxic emissions are discharged. COMAR 26.11.15.06A(1) states, in relevant part, that a person may not construct or operate \"any new installation or source without first demonstrating ... that the total allowable emissions from the premises of each toxic air pollutant discharged by the new installation or source will not unreasonably endanger human health.\" By tying the new installation or source to the toxic emissions from the premises, as used in COMAR 26.11.15.06A(1), \"premises\" plainly means the space or unit from where the emissions are coming,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , the location of the new installation or source; COMAR 26.11.15.06A(1) does not refer to other spaces from which there are no toxic emissions or pollutants, and which are not affected by the new installation or source. It is the installations and sources of toxic emissions that are key to determining what the premises are, not other areas entirely unassociated with the installations and sources of toxic emissions. Indeed, in the context of this case, it would be illogical for \"premises\" to mean a whole commercial park development where the installation or source of toxic emissions will be the crematory located in only one suite of the commercial park and where the other suites do not contain installations or sources of toxic emissions that would need to be regulated. In other words, the entire commercial park is not an installation or source of toxic emissions, and it strains reason to conclude that the entire commercial park must be the \"premises\" under COMAR 26.11.15.06A(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Moreover, adopting the MDE's interpretation of the term \"premises\" as meaning the entire commercial park, extending to the property line, poses two problems. First, the MDE's interpretation of the term \"premises\" sets up an unnecessary\n   demarcation between renters and owners that produces an unreasonable result. If\n   Maryland Crematory, LLC (\"MC\") owned the suite in the commercial park building in which the crematory is to be located-which it does not-then, according to the MDE's interpretation of \"premises,\" the premises would be the suite itself to its property line, and not the entire commercial park to its property line. This is so because the suite, if owned by MC, would be under the \"control of one person or under common control of a group of persons[,]\" as \"premises\" is defined by COMAR 26.11.01.01B(36) and COMAR 26.11.15.01B(12). In other words, the premises would be limited to the area within the property line that is under the control of one person or under the common control of a group of persons,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , the suite owned by MC. However, because MC rents the suite in the commercial park building, the MDE interprets \"premises\" as including the entire commercial park, extended to its property line, which is under the control of a single landlord/business entity, Stone Snyder. Put simply, utilizing the MDE's interpretation of \"premises\" sets up an unnecessary and unwarranted distinction between renters of properties and owners of properties. This is obviously an arbitrary and, indeed, nonsensical outcome that should be avoided.\n   <em>\n    See Twigg\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4265644\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/447/1/#p24\">\n    447 Md. at 24\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4265644\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/447/1/#p24\">\n    133 A.3d at 1139\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"In all cases, when confronted with construing the meaning of a statutory provision, we must provide a reasonable interpretation-one that is consonant with logic and common sense.\" (Citation omitted)).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Second, the obvious goal or intent of regulations concerning ambient impact and compliance with toxic emissions standards is to safeguard human health. COMAR 26.11.15.06A(1) expressly states that a person may not construct, modify, or operate any new installation or source without first demonstrating that the toxic emissions from the installation or source \"will not unreasonably endanger human health.\" Holding that the whole commercial park, to its property line, is the premises for purposes of regulatory compliance in this case could render environmental testing less effective and even meaningless in future cases, and undermine the intent of the\n   regulations to protect human health. Indeed, under the MDE's interpretation of \"premises,\" there could be a development comprised of rental units, under the \"control of one person or under common control of a group of persons[,]\" so large that environmental testing would be rendered meaningless if the installation or source of toxic emissions were a single location or suite within the development. Stated otherwise, if the commercial park in this case were larger and included a larger area within its property line, but the crematory remained just in one suite of the commercial park building, the screening requirements would nonetheless remain the same, but the toxic emissions would be measured against the larger area. As such, under the MDE's interpretation of \"premises,\" there could be a premises so large that environmental testing would serve no practical purpose in measuring and limiting toxic emissions. Thus, applying the MDE's interpretation of the term \"premises\" is simply not logical, and may lead to results that are not consistent with the regulation's intent to safeguard human health.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   Given that the MDE's interpretation of \"premises\" is not a longstanding and consistent interpretation that has been tested and applied over time with workable results, there is less of a basis to defer to the MDE's interpretation in this instance. Accordingly, I would conclude that the plain language of the relevant COMAR, practical considerations, and the need for regulatory compliance to protect human health lead to the conclusion that \"premises\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   means the individual suite in which the crematory is to be located, not the area at and inside the boundary, or property line, of the commercial park in which the suite is located.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   For the above reasons, respectfully, I dissent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   Judge Greene and Judge McDonald have authorized me to state that they join in this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-89\">\n    John Rothamel, Kor-Ko's vice-president, is also a Petitioner.

This \"evidence,\" although decidedly indirect, taken together with the fact that Kor-Ko did not challenge the MDE's assertion that a single landlord owns the commercial park, suggests that a single landlord, which may be Stone Snyder, is indeed the sole owner.

The very definition of \"source,\" however, defines the term, in part, as \"property that contributes to air pollution,\" suggesting that Kor-Ko's proposed interpretation is overly narrow.

There are two potentially illuminating conclusory statements, however, in the fact sheet: under the heading \"Applicable Regulations,\" the MDE referenced \"COMAR 26.11.15.06 [,] which prohibits the discharge of toxic air pollutants to the extent that the emissions will unreasonably endanger human health.\" Later, under the heading \"Toxic Air Pollutant Compliance Demonstration and Analysis,\" the MDE stated, in reference to COMAR 26.11.15.06, \"[t]he projected maximum off-site ground level concentrations, in any direction, for Toxic Air Pollutants are at or below all applicable screening levels.\"\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-114\">\n    The use of the term \"off-site\" suggests consistency with the MDE's current asserted interpretation of \"premises,\" and the term appears a few times in the MDE's responses to public comments. The MDE's argument in its brief, that \"off-site\" means beyond the boundary of the commercial park, relies on two supplemental fact sheets (which the MDE contends are guidance documents) that the MDE submitted for the first time on appeal (impermissibly, according to Kor-Ko), and these fact sheets are the basis of the MDE's argument that it applied a \"longstanding understanding of the term 'premises' here.\" Even if we were to consider those two supplemental fact sheets in our review, there is scant support elsewhere for the conclusory contention that the MDE maintained a \"longstanding\" and consistent interpretation as that asserted here.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"15\">\n   <p id=\"p-115\">\n    Even if the entire commercial park is owned by Stone Snyder, the MDE's invocation of landlord-tenant law principles as directive of an outcome in its favor is not very persuasive. In response to Kor-Ko's point that the commercial park is not under common control because the landlord leased parts of the complex to other businesses, the MDE states that, \"as between the owner of real property and any one of the tenants, the owner of a leased property typically retains ultimate control over the common areas of the property.\" Kor-Ko retorts that control of common areas is irrelevant because that is not where MC operates its business. The MDE presses on, positing that the landlord retains control because, even when it transfers some level of control to a tenant via a lease, the landlord \"has ultimate control because it is the landlord who determines how much of that control to give away.\" We conclude that these tit-for-tat arguments are not particularly helpful in deciding this case.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-116\">\n    Also unhelpful is Kor-Ko's appropriation of the Court of Special Appeals's interpretation of \"property line\" espoused in the context of a criminal law case.\n    <em>\n     Fitzgerald v.

The agency's record must include also, per \u00a7 1-606(c)(4), \"[a] statement or fact sheet explaining the basis for the determination by the Department or Board.\" The agency is not obliged to respond to all public comments, but rather may pick and choose where to do so. \u00a7 1-606(c)(9) (requiring the agency's record to include \"[a]ny response to any comments submitted to the Department or Board.\").\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"19\">\n   <p id=\"p-120\">\n    \"Ambient air means that portion of the atmosphere, external to buildings, to which the general public has access.\"\n    <extracted-citation index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=40%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%2050.1\">\n     40 C.F.R. \u00a7 50.1\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (e). Drawing from this definition, the MDE argues that, because the record does not indicate that the general public has access to the rooftop of the Kor-Ko/MC building, the air surrounding the rooftop air handlers does not constitute \"ambient air.\"\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"20\">\n   <p id=\"p-121\">\n    Although perhaps this pronouncement could be read as not being inconsistent with the MDE's appellate embrace of the EPA's non-binding definition of \"ambient air,\" we would have problems reaching that conclusion on this record.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
