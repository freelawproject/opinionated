Specifically, the case concerns the allegation that the General Assembly usurped the power of the Governor of Maryland by amending Md. Code Ann., Educ. (1978, 2014 Repl. Vol., 2015 Supp.) (\"ED (2015)\") \u00a7 3-110(b), which governs the School Board Nominating Commission of Anne Arundel County (\"the Nominating Commission\") to, among other things, eliminate the ability of the Governor to appoint members to the Nominating Commission. The Nominating Commission's purpose \"is to select nominees to be recommended to the Governor as qualified candidates for appointment to the Anne Arundel County Board of Education [ (\"the School Board\") ].\" Md. Code Ann., Educ. (1978, 2014 Repl. Vol., 2016 Supp.) (\"ED (2016)\") \u00a7 3-110(b)(1)(ii).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Before 2016, ED (2015) \u00a7 3-110(b)(2) provided that the Nominating Commission would consist of eleven members, five of whom were to be appointed by the Governor, and six of whom were to be appointed by various specified entities. In 2016, through Chapter 35 of the 2016 Laws of Maryland (\"Chapter 35\"), the General Assembly amended, among other statutory provisions, ED (2015) \u00a7 3-110(b)(2), to increase the number of members of the Nominating Commission from eleven to thirteen, to eliminate the Governor's ability to appoint five members, and to grant appointment authority to various specified entities for the resulting seven new appointments.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20Md.%20Laws%20600\">\n    2016 Md. Laws 600\n   </extracted-citation>\n   -02 (Vol. I, Ch. 35, H.B. 172). In other words, the amendment to ED (2015) \u00a7 3-110(b)(2) changed the Nominating Commission from a body, some of whose members were appointed by the Governor, and some of whose members were appointed by various specified entities, to a body that is completely comprised of members who are\n   appointed by various specified entities other than the Governor. Through Chapter 35, the General Assembly also ended the terms of the Governor's five appointees to the Nominating Commission early, causing the appointments to terminate as of June 1, 2016.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20Md.%20Laws%20600\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20Md.%20Laws%20600\">\n    at 605\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Four of the five gubernatorial appointees filed suit in the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County (\"the circuit court\"), contending that the General Assembly removed them from their positions as members of the Nominating Commission in violation\n   of Article II, \u00a7 15 of the Maryland Constitution (Suspension and Removal of Officers) and Article 8 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights (Separation of Powers). The circuit court agreed and issued a preliminary injunction against implementation and enforcement of certain portions of Chapter 35, including those portions amending ED (2015) \u00a7 3-110(b)(2) to alter the membership and appointment process for members of the Nominating Commission and ending the terms of the current gubernatorial appointees on June 1, 2016. The State of Maryland (\"the State\") and Governor Lawrence J. Hogan, Jr. (\"Governor Hogan\"), Appellants, noted an appeal to the Court of Special Appeals, and, while the case was pending in that Court, filed in this Court a petition for a writ of\n   <em>\n    certiorari\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   This Court granted the petition. The petition raises the issues of whether the circuit court erred in enjoining the implementation of portions of Chapter 35 by concluding that Chapter 35 violated Article II, \u00a7 15 of the Maryland Constitution and Article 8 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights, and by treating members of the Nominating Commission as \"civil officers\" within the meaning of Article II, \u00a7 15. We hold that the circuit court erred in issuing the preliminary injunction because Chapter 35 does not violate Article II, \u00a7 15 of the Maryland Constitution or Article 8 of the Declaration of Rights, but rather restructures or reconstitutes the Nominating Commission and prospectively changes the appointment process to grant appointment power to specified entities other than the Governor; and that terminating the terms of the gubernatorial appointees as part of the restructuring is permissible.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Given that Chapter 35 does not constitute a violation of Article II, \u00a7 15 of the Maryland Constitution or Article 8 of the Declaration of Rights, but instead restructures or reconstitutes the Nominating Commission, we need not reach the issue of whether members of the Nominating Commission are civil officers under Article II, \u00a7 15.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    Statutory Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The Governor appoints members of the School Board.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ED (2016) \u00a7 3-110(a)(2). Prior to 2007, when a vacancy on the School Board occurred, the Anne Arundel County School Board Nominating Convention, a private association, submitted a list of nominees; and, as a matter of custom, the Governor usually appointed a School Board member from the list of nominees. In 2007, however, that process changed with the establishment of the Nominating Commission, through an amendment to Md. Code Ann., Educ. (1978, 2006 Repl. Vol.) \u00a7 3-110.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2007%20Md.%20Laws%202700\">\n    2007 Md.

Nominating Commission ... as provided in subsection (b) of this section.\" A School Board member would then \"serve for the remainder of the member's term, ... subject to the approval or rejection of the registered voters of the county at the next general election.\" ED (2015) \u00a7 3-110(c)(1). In the general election, voters \"vote[d] for the [School Board] member's\n   retention or removal.\" ED (2015) \u00a7 3-110(c)(3)(i). ED (2015) \u00a7 3-110(c)(4) stated: \"If the voters reject the retention of the member, or the vote is tied: (i) The position shall become vacant 10 days after certification of the election returns; and (ii) The member serves until a successor is appointed and qualifies.\" (Paragraph breaks omitted). In other words, in the event of a rejection of retention or a tied vote on the retention of a School Board member, the position automatically became vacant, and the nomination process would begin again.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   In 2016, at the request of the Anne Arundel County Administration, House Bill 172 was introduced, proposing amendments to ED (2015) \u00a7 3-110(b).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   2016 Md.

As originally introduced on January 21, 2016, House Bill 172 sought to alter the membership of the Nominating Commission by allowing certain chambers of commerce to appoint a member of the Nominating Commission. Specifically, House Bill 172 sought to:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   alter[ ] the membership of the [ ] Nominating Commission [ ] to provide that, beginning on a certain date and every certain number of years thereafter, one member shall be appointed by certain chambers of commerce on a rotating basis in a specified order; alter[ ] the term of the member appointed by a chamber of commerce; provid[e] for the termination of the term of a certain member of the Commission; and generally relat[e] to the membership of the ...

The only other proposed amendment to ED (2015) \u00a7 3-110(b) was to decrease the term of a Nominating Commission member appointed by a Chamber of Commerce to two years, instead of four years.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   2016 Md. Leg. Sess. H.B. 172 at 3 (First Reader).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Later, House Bill 172 underwent substantial amendment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   2016 Md. Leg. Sess.

As amended, among other things, House Bill 172 eliminated the process by which the Governor appointed members to the Nominating Commission, established a process by which members of the Nominating Commission were to be appointed by various groups, and was to take effect on June 1, 2016.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at 2-4, 6. Significant to this case, Section 2 of House Bill 172 provided as follows: \"That the terms of the members of the ...

Governor Hogan vetoed House Bill 172. In a letter to the Speaker of the House dated April 5, 2016, Governor Hogan explained the reasons for his veto, in pertinent part, as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   On its face, House Bill 172 is unconstitutional because it only terminates the terms of the Governor's members of the ...

While the General Assembly may change the appointment method of prospective members of a governmental body, it cannot abrogate the Governor's authority under Article II, Section 15 of the Maryland Constitution by terminating his current appointees prior to the expiration of their terms.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   ... Section 2 of House Bill 172 ... provides for premature termination, i.e., removal, of the Governor's incumbent members, an improper reconstitution of the [Nominating] Commission that the Court of Appeals has found to be an unconstitutional \"usurpation of executive power in violation of Article II, [Sections] 1, 9 and 15 of the Maryland Constitution\" and a \"violation of Article 8 of the Declaration of Rights of Maryland.\"\n   <em>\n    Schisler\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"532146\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/394/519/\">\n    394 Md. at 596\n   </extracted-citation>\n   [,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"532146\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/394/519/\">\n    907 A.2d at 220\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ].

In the complaint, the Appointees contended that, through Chapter 35, the General Assembly removed them from their positions as members of the Nominating Commission in violation of Article II, \u00a7 15 of the Maryland Constitution (Suspension and Removal of Officers) and Article 8 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights (Separation of Powers). The Appointees argued that they are \"civil officers\" under Article II, \u00a7 15 and that the General Assembly had violated the separation of powers doctrine by usurping the Governor's exclusive authority to remove civil officers whom the Governor had appointed, as established by Article II, \u00a7 15 of the Maryland Constitution, which provides, in relevant part, that \"[t]he Governor ... may remove for incompetency, or misconduct, all civil officers who received appointment from the Executive for a term of years.\" The Appointees noted that Chapter 35 removed only the gubernatorial appointees, not\n   any other members of the Nominating Commission, and asserted that Chapter 35 did not reconstitute the Nominating Commission.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   As such, in the complaint, the Appointees sought a declaratory judgment that Chapter 35 violated Article II, \u00a7 15 of the Maryland Constitution and Article 8 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights. The Appointees also sought injunctive relief in the form of: a temporary restraining order; a preliminary injunction preventing Chapter 35 from taking effect and preventing the State from implementing Chapter 35 during the pendency of the litigation; and a permanent injunction preventing Chapter 35 from taking effect and preventing the State from implementing Chapter 35 permanently.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   On May 10, 2016, the circuit court conducted a hearing on the request for a temporary restraining order, and on May 11, 2016, the circuit court entered an order denying the request for a temporary restraining order. On May 17, 2016, the State filed an opposition to the request for a preliminary injunction, contending that\n   the Appointees were not entitled to declaratory or injunctive relief because the State had sovereign immunity, which it had not waived. The State further asserted that a plaintiff could bring suit for declaratory and injunctive relief only against the \"specific government official who is responsible for action under the statute, not against the State itself.\" (Citations and internal quotation marks omitted). The following day, on May 18, 2016, the Appointees filed an amended complaint, naming Governor Hogan in his official capacity as an additional defendant, and alleging that Governor Hogan \"is responsible for taking care that the Laws are faithfully executed.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Citation, brackets, and internal quotation marks omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   On May 23, 2016, the circuit court conducted a hearing on the request for a preliminary injunction.

On the same day, the State objected to the Appointees' proposed order and submitted an alternative proposed order. The State contended that, even under the circuit court's view of the law, many provisions of Chapter 35 did not raise separation of powers concerns, were severable, and should be permitted to go into effect. On May 27, 2016, the circuit court issued a brief memorandum, stating that it believed that the proposed order submitted by the State \"most accurately\n   reflect [ed] the holding and intention of the Court\" and that it would sign that order. As such, on May 27, 2016, the circuit court adopted and issued the State's proposed order, which provided as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-123\">\n   The [Appointees] have established they meet the requirements for preliminary injunctive relief: (1) the [Appointees] have established a likelihood of\n   success on the merits, (2) the balance of convenience weighs in favor of the [Appointees], (3) the [Appointees] will suffer irreparable harm in the absence of a preliminary injunction, and (4) a preliminary injunction is in the public interest.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-124\">\n   It is likely that the [Appointees] will establish that the following provisions of 2016 Md.

The State argues that Chapter 35 is consistent with the separation of powers doctrine and Article II, \u00a7 15 of the Maryland Constitution because the power of appointment is not an intrinsically executive function,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , a power that is exclusive to the Governor; instead, under Article II, \u00a7 10 of the Maryland Constitution, the General Assembly may prescribe a different mode of appointment. The State asserts that the General Assembly may restructure or reconstitute a statutorily-created entity and prospectively change the appointment process to grant the appointment power for that entity to someone other than the Governor, even if doing so would terminate the existing gubernatorial appointees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   The State contends that Chapter 35 changes the number and composition of the Nominating Commission, and creates a new appointment process that applies prospectively to all future appointees. According to the State, through Chapter 35, the General Assembly did not give itself the power to choose replacements for the Appointees or prevent the Appointees from being reappointed, but rather reassigned the appointment power from the Governor to other entities. The State argues that the Appointees draw an \"artificial distinction\" by pointing out that the General Assembly terminated only the Appointees' membership on the Nominating Commission, and left intact the other six existing appointments-\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , the\n   appointments by entities other than the Governor-because terminating the other existing appointments would not have given the General Assembly any more authority to terminate the Appointees' membership on the Nominating Commission than it already had. The State further contends that, even assuming that, through Chapter 35, the General Assembly were \"removing\" the Appointees, such a removal does not violate Article II, \u00a7 15 because members of the Nominating Commission are not \"civil officers.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   The Appointees respond that Chapter 35 is unconstitutional and violates the separation of powers doctrine and Article II, \u00a7 15 of the Maryland Constitution because the General Assembly has impermissibly usurped the Governor's constitutional removal power by terminating only their appointments. According to the Appointees, the removal of civil officers who are appointed by the Governor for a term of years is a constitutional power that is reserved exclusively to the Governor, and cannot be exercised by the General Assembly. The Appointees contend that, under\n   <em>\n    Schisler\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"532146\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/394/519/\">\n    394 Md. 519\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"532146\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/394/519/\">\n    907 A.2d 175\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , the General Assembly may abolish or reconstitute a commission, but may not terminate only the gubernatorial appointees on a commission.

Although the plurality concluded that the early ending of terms must be incidental to an abolishment or reconstituting of the commission, Judges Wilner, Harrell, Raker, and Battaglia, despite expressing differing views in their opinions on the issue, would have concluded that no constitutional violation occurs simply by virtue of the circumstance that the terms of the incumbent members of the Public Service Commission were ended early,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , that termination of the gubernatorial appointees' terms alone does not violate Article II, \u00a7 15.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-176\">\n   Applying the rationale of\n   <em>\n    Schisler\n   </em>\n   here, we conclude that termination of the Appointees' terms was incidental to the General Assembly's restructuring and reconstituting of the Nominating Commission, and that, under\n   <em>\n    Schisler\n   </em>\n   , according\n   to a majority of this Court, such action does not rise\n   to the level of a constitutional violation. Here, Chapter 35 did not simply terminate or end early the Appointees' terms. Rather, through Chapter 35, the General Assembly made numerous changes to the structure and function of the Nominating Commission that demonstrate that the General Assembly restructured and reconstituted the Nominating Commission. Particularly, Chapter 35 amended ED (2015) \u00a7 3-110(b)(2) by: (1) increasing the number of members of the Nominating Commission from eleven to thirteen,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , adding two members; (2) eliminating the Governor's ability to appoint five members; (3) enabling the County Executive of Anne Arundel County to appoint three members instead of one; (4) enabling the Anne Arundel County Council of Parent Teacher Associations to appoint two members instead of one; and (5) enabling one appointment each by the Anne Arundel County Branch of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, CASA de Maryland, the Anne Arundel Special Education Citizens' Advisory Committee, and one among a rotating list of the chambers of commerce of Anne Arundel County. Thus, Chapter 35 increased the overall membership of the Nominating Commission, and reorganized and expanded the appointment authority for new members.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-177\">\n   Notably, Chapter 35 also amended ED (2015) \u00a7 3-110(b) in other significant ways by: (1) requiring that all members of the Nominating Commission be residents of Anne Arundel County, where no similar provision existed previously; (2) authorizing the members of the Nominating Commission to select their chair from among the members, where previously the Governor designated the chair of the Nominating Commission from among the gubernatorial appointees; (3) providing that the term of the chair of the Nominating Commission would be two years, whereas previously it had been four years; (4) creating an eight-year term limit on membership, where no similar provision existed previously; (5) providing that the School Board is the entity responsible for providing staff to the Nominating Commission, where previously the Department of Legislative Services was responsible for\n   providing staff to the Nominating Commission; (6) providing that a supermajority vote is required for the Nominating Commission to take action, where no similar provision existed previously; (7) prohibiting proxy voting, where no similar provision existed previously; (8) providing that the Nominating Commission must require School Board applicants to include certain information in their applications, where no similar provision existed previously; and (9) requiring the Nominating Commission to consult the Maryland Judiciary Case Search to verify certain statements made by School Board applicants, where no similar provision existed previously. Overall, Chapter 35 changed the manner in which the Nominating Commission functions by altering its responsibilities and duties, as well as reconstituting the membership of the Nominating Commission and changing the appointment process.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-178\">\n   Through Chapter 35, among other things, the General Assembly made numerous significant changes to the Nominating Commission, restructuring the Nominating Commission and altering the appointment process so that, in relevant part, the appointment of members to the Nominating Commission is wholly within the purview of specified entities, and not partly the responsibility of the Governor and partly the responsibility of specified entities, as it was prior to Chapter 35. Going forward, it is accurate that the Governor would have no ability to appoint members to the Nominating Commission, and that, in restructuring the Nominating\n   Commission, the General Assembly terminated the terms of the Appointees early. Under\n   <em>\n    Schisler\n   </em>\n   , 394 Md. at 598,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"532146\" index=\"145\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/394/519/\">\n    907 A.2d at 222\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , however, that the terms of the Appointees were terminated early does not mean that Chapter 35 runs afoul of Article II, \u00a7 15 or the separation of powers doctrine where the early termination is incidental to the restructuring or reconstituting of the Nominating Commission. Such is the case here-the termination of the Appointees' terms was attendant to a restructuring of the Nominating Commission.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"532146\" index=\"146\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/394/519/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"532146\" index=\"146\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/394/519/\">\n    at 598\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"532146\" index=\"147\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/394/519/\">\n    907 A.2d at 222\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"If the General Assembly chooses to abolish or reconstitute the Public Service Commission or any other statutory board or commission, it is competent to do so, even if the effect of that\n   abolition or reconstitution would be the shortening or ending of existing terms of incumbent members.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-179\">\n   Moreover, regardless of whether the members of the Nominating Commission are civil officers under Article II, \u00a7 15, we observe that Chapter 35-by restructuring the Nominating Commission to provide for appointments by specified entities and not the Governor, and by terminating the Appointees' terms early-does not violate Article II, \u00a7 10 of the Maryland Constitution. Indeed, this Court has historically recognized that, when the General Assembly creates an office by statute, the General Assembly has the authority to designate the mode of appointment to that office.\n   <em>\n    See Stillman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2097243\" index=\"148\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/291/390/#p409\">\n    291 Md. at 409\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"149\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=435%20A.2d%20747\">\n    435 A.2d at 757\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Here, clearly, the Nominating Commission is a legislative creation, and the members of the Nominating Commission are members of the Nominating Commission only because of the enactment of ED (2015) \u00a7 3-110(b). As such, the General Assembly is authorized to specify the mode of appointment of members of the Nominating Commission, and may prescribe a different mode of appointment-which is exactly what the General Assembly did in this case through Chapter 35.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-180\">\n   To be sure, in restructuring the Nominating Commission and prescribing a different mode of appointment, the General Assembly ended the terms of the Appointees early and did not alter or end the terms of the other members of the Nominating Commission who had been appointed by entities other than the Governor. This, however, is not a unique circumstance. On multiple occasions, the General Assembly has altered the membership of a statutory board or commission without removing all of the other incumbent members. For example, through Chapter 739 of the 2016 Laws of Maryland, the General Assembly renamed the State Board of Chiropractic and Massage Therapy Examiners as the State Board of\n   Chiropractic Examiners, and amended Md. Code Ann., Health Occ. (1981, 2014 Repl. Vol., 2015 Supp.) (\"HO (2015)\") \u00a7 3-202 to decrease the number of members of the State Board of Chiropractic Examiners from eleven to seven.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"151\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20Md.%20Laws%207509\">\n    2016 Md. Laws 7509\n   </extracted-citation>\n   -10 (Vol. IX, Ch. 739, H.B. 1420). In so doing, the General Assembly provided as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-181\">\n   That, on October 1, 2016, the position on the State Board of Chiropractic and\n   Massage Therapy Examiners held by the longest serving licensed chiropractor member of the Board and the three positions held by the licensed massage therapist members of the Board shall terminate so as to reduce the number of positions on the newly established State Board of Chiropractic Examiners in accordance with \u00a7 3-202 of the Health Occupations Article [.]\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-182\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"152\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20Md.%20Laws%207540\">\n    2016 Md.

Code Ann., State Gov't (1984, 2009 Repl. Vol., 2013 Supp.) \u00a7 9-803(a) and altered the membership of the Financial Education and Capability Commission \"to include the Secretary of Higher Education, or the Secretary's designee, rather than a member of the Higher Education Commission [.]\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"153\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2014%20Md.%20Laws%201645\">\n    2014 Md.

And, the alteration of the membership of the Nominating Commission with the Appointees' terms ending early in no way undermines the circumstance that the General Assembly made broad changes to the function of the Nominating Commission, and the manner of appointment of its members;\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , ending the Appointees' terms early was but one feature of the restructuring of the Nominating Commission, and not a singular act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-184\">\n   Before moving on, we are compelled to explain that this case presents circumstances that are vastly different from those presented in\n   <em>\n    Schisler\n   </em>\n   and, thus, results in a different outcome.

The legislation provided that, after the interim, temporary appointment process, and after the terms of the interim members expired, appointments to the Public Service Commission would resume as it had, with the Governor appointing members with the advice and consent of the Senate.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"532146\" index=\"161\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/394/519/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"532146\" index=\"161\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/394/519/\">\n    at 545\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"532146\" index=\"162\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/394/519/\">\n    907 A.2d at 190\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In other words, the legislation at issue in\n   <em>\n    Schisler\n   </em>\n   did not involve a restructuring or reconstituting of the Public Service Commission that would implement changes that would apply prospectively to all future appointees to the Public Service Commission, but rather involved the General Assembly wresting authority away from the Governor and giving itself the one-time authority to submit lists to the Governor and make appointments before reverting back to the old gubernatorial appointment process.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-185\">\n   By contrast, in this case, the General Assembly has instituted a variety of changes to the Nominating Commission, including to the composition and number of members; these changes apply prospectively to all future appointees, and restructure the Nominating Commission. Moreover, Chapter 35 does not involve the General Assembly giving itself the power to appoint members to the Nominating Commission or instituting an artificial gubernatorial appointment process before returning to a prior appointment process, as was the case in\n   <em>\n    Schisler\n   </em>\n   . Indeed, here, the General Assembly is not involved in the appointment of members to the Nominating Commission; and, the General Assembly has never had the authority to appoint members to the Nominating Commission, either before or after Chapter 35. Stated otherwise, through Chapter 35, the General Assembly did not give itself the power to\n   choose replacements for the Appointees or prevent the Appointees from being reappointed by the other entities. Rather, in restructuring the Nominating Commission, among a myriad of other changes, the General Assembly simply reassigned the appointment power from the Governor to other entities.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-186\">\n   Because we hold that Chapter 35 does not violate Article II, \u00a7 15 of the Maryland Constitution or Article 8 of the Declaration of Rights, but rather restructures or reconstitutes the Nominating Commission and prospectively changes the appointment process to grant the appointment power to specified entities other than the Governor, and that the Appointees' terms were permissibly terminated as a result of the restructuring, we need not address whether members of the Nominating Commission are civil officers under Article II, \u00a7 15. Stated otherwise, because we conclude that Article II, \u00a7 15 of the Maryland Constitution, which applies to military officers and civil officers, has not been violated, whether members of the Nominating Commission are civil officers in the first instance is not dispositive of the case. In sum, we hold that there is no separation of powers violation in this case and that the circuit court erred in issuing the preliminary injunction. Chapter 35 does not violate Article II, \u00a7 15 of the Maryland Constitution or Article 8 of the Declaration of Rights, but rather restructures the Nominating Commission, a result of which is the termination of the Appointees' terms.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-187\">\n   Accordingly, we reverse the circuit court's judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-188\">\n   <strong>\n    JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR ANNE ARUNDEL COUNTY REVERSED.
