The courts sought advice whether specific theories advanced in those actions are precluded by this court's adoption of \u00a7 402A of the Restatement (Second) of Torts, which imposes liability for defective products that are \"unreasonably dangerous,\" and more particularly, our adoption of comment (i) to \u00a7 402A, which defines that term in relation to\n   consumers' knowledge of the danger.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   In the first of these actions, this court advised that the strict liability theory advanced was not precluded because it required application of our modified consumer expectation test, under which the obviousness of the danger is only one of many factors that the trier of fact may consider.\n   <em>\n    Izzarelli\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=321%20Conn.%20172\">\n    321 Conn. 172\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 177,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=136%20A.3d%201232\">\n    136 A.3d 1232\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2016).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In the present action, this court considers three substantive questions: (1) whether, for claims alleging design defects, we should abandon our dual tests based on\n   \u00a7 402A of the Restatement (Second) of Torts and adopt the standards under the Restatement (Third) of Torts, Products Liability; (2) if not, whether \u00a7 402A and comment (i) provide a single, unitary definition for all theories under which product liability claims may be brought, including negligence; and (3) whether the punitive damages available in the act are limited to litigation costs under our common-law punitive damages rule. This court raised the first question; we accepted certification with respect to the second and third questions, pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 51-199b(d), from the United States District Court for the District of Connecticut. See\n   <em>\n    Bifolck\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Philip Morris, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , Docket No. 3:06cv1768 (SRU),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2014%20WL%20585325\">\n    2014 WL 585325\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (D. Conn. February 14, 2014).\n   For the reasons that follow, we decline at this time to adopt the Restatement (Third). Nonetheless, we are persuaded that modest refinements to our product liability tests under the Restatement (Second) will clarify the plaintiff's burden of proof in strict liability cases and provide a better guide to any necessity for adopting the Restatement (Third) or any other substantive change. We further conclude that, although all product liability claims require proof of a \"defective condition unreasonably dangerous\" to the user or consumer, unreasonably dangerous is not determined by consumer expectations under comment (i) to \u00a7 402A when such a claim may be brought under a theory of negligence. Finally, we conclude that punitive damages under the act are not limited by the common-law rule. Accordingly, we answer both of the certified questions \"No.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   BACKGROUND OF THE PRESENT CASE\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The following facts and procedural history gave rise to the issues presently before us. The plaintiff, Vincent Bifolck, individually and as executor of the estate of his wife, Jeanette D. Bifolck (decedent), commenced this action in the District Court against the defendant, Philip Morris, Inc., after the decedent succumbed to lung cancer at the age of forty-two. The principal thrust of the complaint is that the Marlboro and Marlboro Light cigarettes manufactured by the defendant and smoked by the decedent were defectively designed and that this defective design was responsible for her lung cancer and death from that disease. The plaintiff sought compensatory damages, as well as statutory punitive damages under General Statutes \u00a7 52-240b.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   One count of the complaint asserted a product liability claim under the act, but set forth separate allegations\n   in support of theories of strict liability and negligence.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   With respect to strict liability, the plaintiff alleged that the defendant's cigarettes were defective and unreasonably dangerous in that their design rendered the cigarettes unnecessarily addictive and unnecessarily carcinogenic. Specifically, the plaintiff alleged that the defendant had (1) added ingredients, including carcinogenic ingredients, that altered the natural form of the tobacco in the cigarettes, and (2) utilized manufacturing processes that affected the composition and form of the tobacco and nicotine, as well as the manner\n   in which the cigarette smoke was transmitted to the smoker. With respect to negligence, the plaintiff alleged that the defendant had failed to conform to the applicable standard of care by knowingly designing the cigarettes in a manner that enhanced their addictive and cancer causing nature and by failing to take available measures to reduce the cigarettes' addictive, toxic, and cancer causing ingredients/properties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   After the plaintiff commenced the present action, judgment was rendered in the District Court in another action against a different cigarette manufacturer on the basis of similar allegations of strict liability and negligence. See\n   <em>\n    Izzarelli\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4170978\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/806/516/#p519\">\n    806 F.Supp.2d 516\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 519-20 (D. Conn. 2011). Following the appeal by the defendant, R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company, from that judgment to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, that court certified the following question to this court: \"Does [comment (i) ] to \u00a7 402A of the Restatement (Second) of Torts preclude a suit premised on\n   <em>\n    strict products\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    liability\n   </em>\n   against a cigarette manufacturer based on evidence that the defendant purposefully manufactured cigarettes to increase daily consumption without regard to the resultant increase in exposure to carcinogens, but in the absence of evidence of adulteration or contamination?\" (Emphasis added.)\n   <em>\n    Izzarelli\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3705564\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/731/164/#p169\">\n    731 F.3d 164\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 169 (2d Cir. 2013). A particular focus of that question related to an example in comment (i) providing that \"good tobacco\" is not unreasonably dangerous. See footnote 2 of this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The trial in the present case was postponed to await this court's response to that question. In the intervening period, the District Court certified two additional questions to this court for advice: (1) \"Does [\u00a7] 402A of the Restatement (Second) of Torts (and comment [i] to that provision) apply to a product liability claim for negligence under [the act]?\"; and (2) \"Does Connecticut's [common-law] rule of punitive damages as articulated in\n   <em>\n    Waterbury Petroleum Products, Inc.\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Canaan Oil &amp; Fuel Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"557049\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/193/208/\">\n    193 Conn. 208\n   </extracted-citation>\n   [\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=477%20A.2d%20988\">\n    477 A.2d 988\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ] (1984), apply to an award of statutory punitive damages pursuant to [General Statutes] \u00a7 52-240b, the punitive damages provision of the [act]?\"\n   <em>\n    Bifolck\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Philip Morris, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2014%20WL%20585325\">\n    2014 WL 585325\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   After oral argument to this court on both cases, we issued our decision in\n   <em>\n    Izzarelli\n   </em>\n   , in which we advised that comment (i) to \u00a7 402A did not preclude the strict liability theory advanced.\n   <em>\n    Izzarelli\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    R.J.

We clarified that, although the two tests available under our law-the ordinary consumer expectation test and the modified consumer expectation test-both apply \u00a7 402A's unreasonably dangerous standard, \"the modified consumer expectation test is our primary strict product liability test, and the sole test applicable to the present case. Because the obvious danger exceptions to strict liability in comment (i) to \u00a7 402A of the Restatement (Second),\n   including '[g]ood tobacco,' are not dispositive under the multifactor modified consumer expectation test, we answer the certified question in the negative.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=136%20A.3d%201232\">\n    Id.\n   </extracted-citation>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The jury in\n   <em>\n    Izzarelli\n   </em>\n   had been instructed on both strict liability tests and rendered a general verdict in favor of the plaintiff. Id., at 182,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=136%20A.3d%201232\">\n    136 A.3d 1232\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Neither party had advocated for application of any test other than one of the two tests based on the Restatement (Second) recognized by this court.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=136%20A.3d%201232\">\n    Id.,\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at 192 n.11,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=136%20A.3d%201232\">\n    136 A.3d 1232\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Nonetheless, a concurring opinion took the position that we should adopt and apply to the certified question in that case the standard\n   for design defects under the Restatement (Third). Id., at 211,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=477%20A.2d%20988\">\n    477 A.2d 988\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Zarella, J.\n   </em>\n   , concurring).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Although that position did not garner majority support in that case, the posture of the present case is more conducive to consideration of this issue. Unlike\n   <em>\n    Izzarelli\n   </em>\n   , this case has not yet proceeded to trial. Accordingly, the issue raised by the\n   <em>\n    Izzarelli\n   </em>\n   concurrence can be considered with the benefit of supplemental briefing, but without the possibility of disturbing a presumptively valid verdict under the existing standards in the absence of a challenge to those standards.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   In light of these considerations, we issued an order to the parties in the present case, concurrently with the issuance of our decision in\n   <em>\n    Izzarelli\n   </em>\n   , seeking supplemental briefs on the following questions: (1) whether, for product liability actions premised on design defects, this court should abandon the ordinary consumer expectation test/modified consumer expectation test and adopt \u00a7\u00a7 1, 2 (b) and 4 of the Restatement (Third), with or without the associated commentary;\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   and (2) if\n   so, whether there is any reason why this court should not apply the Restatement (Third) standard to cases pending before a trial court, like the present case. We also invited professional organizations to submit amicus briefs on the first question. Pursuant to the parties' joint request, the court heard oral argument on these questions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   WHETHER TO ABANDON THE RESTATEMENT (SECOND) IN FAVOR OF THE RESTATEMENT (THIRD) FOR DESIGN DEFECT CLAIMS\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   We begin with the question that this court raised because its answer could be dispositive of the first certified question regarding whether consumer expectations under comment (i) to \u00a7 402A govern recovery for a defective design under a theory of negligence. See Restatement (Third), supra, \u00a7 2, comment (g), pp. 27-28 (explaining that \"consumer expectations do not constitute an independent standard for judging the defectiveness of product designs\" and that such expectations are \"relevant\" but not controlling).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   A\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Parties' Positions\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The parties and the amici supporting their respective positions take sharply divergent views on every consideration\n   relevant to this issue. The plaintiff urges us not to abandon our dual Restatement (Second) tests, characterizing the Restatement\n   (Third) as a significant departure from our long-standing strict liability standard and the public policies that this standard advances. Conversely, the defendant urges us to adopt the Restatement (Third), characterizing it as consistent with our case law, our act, and litigation practice. To the extent that both parties acknowledge that the Restatement (Third) will make some change to our product liability law, they point to different effects of those changes. The plaintiff contends that these changes will have a detrimental, unfair effect on injured consumers, whereas the defendant contends that these changes will provide greater clarity and objectivity without such effects. The plaintiff contends that the task of weighing the numerous policy considerations implicated is better left to the legislature, whereas the defendant contends that the issue should be resolved by this court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   B\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Current Standard under Our Law\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Prior to 1965, plaintiffs in Connecticut relied on theories of negligence and breach of warranty in actions to recovery for injuries caused by defective products.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   In 1965, Connecticut adopted the strict liability standard\n   for product liability actions under \u00a7 402A of the Restatement (Second), under which a plaintiff need not establish the manufacturer's fault. See\n   <em>\n    Garthwait\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Burgio\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1574226\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/153/284/#p289\">\n    153 Conn. 284\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 289-90,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=216%20A.2d%20189\">\n    216 A.2d 189\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1965) ; 2 Restatement (Second), Torts, \u00a7 402A, comment (a), p. 348 (1965) (product seller is \"subject to liability to the user or consumer even though he has exercised all possible care in the preparation and sale of the product\"). Under that standard, a manufacturer or seller of a product may be held liable if the product is \"unreasonably dangerous ....\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   2 Restatement (Second), supra, \u00a7 402A (1), p. 347. A primary justification for imposing strict liability has been that, as between the injured consumer and the manufacturer who has derived the economic benefits from the sale of the product, the latter is better able to insure against the risk and can pass that cost along to all consumers.

A product \"is defective in design when the foreseeable risks of harm posed by the product could have been reduced or avoided by the adoption of a reasonable alternative design by the seller or other distributor, or a predecessor in the commercial chain of distribution, and the omission of the alternative design renders the product not reasonably safe ....\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   Restatement (Third), supra, \u00a7 2(b), p. 14.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   The comments elaborate on the practical application of this standard.

Restatement (Third), supra, \u00a7 2(b), p. 14.

According to the plaintiff, adopting the Restatement (Third) would make product liability cases significantly more expensive to litigate; in many cases requiring expert testimony/product prototypes to establish that the alternative design is reasonable. As such, he contends it will be more likely that cases will be decided on pretrial motions testing the adequacy of this proof and that injured consumers with smaller damages will be unable to bring product liability actions at all.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   In response, the defendant and some of the amici contend that adoption of the Restatement (Third) would not significantly alter our law\n   <em>\n    in practice\n   </em>\n   , because plaintiffs typically elect to proffer proof of an alternative design. The defendant does not, and could not, claim, however, that plaintiffs have ever assumed the burden of proving that the harm was foreseeable. Moreover,\n   the defendant's argument does not account for the fact that the adequacy of this proof has generally not been the subject of serious controversy and pretrial motions because plaintiffs have not been required to prove the reasonableness of the alternative design to prevail.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   D\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Whether the Restatement (Third) Should Be Adopted\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   In his concurring opinion in\n   <em>\n    Izzarelli\n   </em>\n   , Justice Zarella set forth several reasons why he believes that, regardless of the degree of difference, the greater clarity and objectivity that the Restatement (Third) provides over our current standards favors its adoption.

Not a single case applying Connecticut law has been brought to our attention demonstrating either that a jury had difficulty applying our law or that a jury's verdict yielded\n   a bizarre or unconscionable result. Indeed, we noted in\n   <em>\n    Izzarelli\n   </em>\n   that we would trust our trial courts to safeguard against any such result.

No interest group has sought change legislatively. Shortly before the court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Potter\n   </em>\n   , the Connecticut Business and Industry Association drafted a bill that sought to amend our act to incorporate the definition of design defect in the draft Restatement (Third).

That bill was not acted on by the Judiciary Committee after it heard competing views on it at a public hearing. Since\n   <em>\n    Potter\n   </em>\n   , other legislation has been proposed to amend the act; see Raised Bill No. 5731, 2002 Sess. (proposing to preclude evidence of subsequent remedial measures in product liability actions); see also Public Acts 2011, No. 11-200, \u00a7 1 (amending limitation period for asbestos related product liability claims); but none that would have changed our product liability standards.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   An argument that our standard is unworkable because it lacks an \"objective\" basis for decision-making was implicitly rejected in\n   <em>\n    Potter\n   </em>\n   , and is both circular and contradicted by experience. The presumption on which this argument rests is that failing to require proof of a reasonable alternative design in a risk-utility test deprives the fact finder of an objective basis for decision-making because it lacks an alternative against\n   which to compare the marketed product. The flaw in this argument is that it assumes that a product cannot be unsafe unless it can be made safer. If the fact finder's task is to determine whether the defendant could have made a safer product, it necessarily follows that the absence of an alternative design makes this task impossible. If, however, the fact finder's task is to assess whether the product is unreasonably dangerous because its risks exceed its utility, no comparison to an alternative is necessary. The fact that jurors commonly engage in such a balancing test whenever they are called upon to assess reasonableness, such as in a claim of negligence, evidences that such weighing is workable. See 2 Restatement (Second), supra, \u00a7 291, p. 54 (\"[w]here an act is one which a reasonable man would recognize as involving a risk of harm to another, the risk is unreasonable and the act is negligent if the risk is of such magnitude as to outweigh what the law regards as the utility of the act or of the particular manner in which it is done\"); see also\n   <em>\n    Rodriguez\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Suzuki Motor Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11654735\" index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/996/47/#p65\">\n    996 S.W.2d 47\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 65 (Mo. 1999) (\"the term unreasonably dangerous, as used in [\u00a7] 402A and [the model jury instructions], needs no judicial definition, whether derived from consumer expectations, risk-utility, or otherwise\" [internal quotation marks omitted] ). Indeed, even under the Restatement (Third), the fact finder weighs the risks and utility of each respective design before comparing the alternative design to\n   the product sold.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   We also note that Connecticut's standard is hardly an outlier. It is not a fruitful exercise to attempt to obtain a precise count of how many jurisdictions have\n   adopted or rejected the Restatement (Third) standard. Like every other aspect of this area of the law, parties on each side of this debate disagree about what legal standard has been adopted in the various jurisdictions and whether that determination should be made on the basis of how the court has articulated its standard or how the cases have been litigated.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   It suffices for our purposes that several other jurisdictions apply similar standards to ours, some for many years.

Although the Restatement (Third) provides some exceptions to this requirement, they are exceedingly limited in their operation. Of particular concern is the narrow scope of manifestly unreasonable designs, which excuses this requirement only for products of negligible utility. This standard will not apply \"in most instances even though the plaintiff alleges that the category of product sold by the defendant is so dangerous that it should not have been marketed at all.\" Restatement (Third), supra, \u00a7 2, comment (d), p. 20. Thus, proof of a reasonable alternative design would be required even if the design creates a risk of grave injury or death, as long as the product has some appreciable utility. Moreover, the Restatement (Third) would seem to immunize certain classes of products, like novel products for which there is no alternative design.

This is so because the small class of cases posing issues of sufficient consequence to result in reported, precedential decisions naturally tends to raise narrow unsettled issues and/or fact-sensitive applications, rather than to provide vehicles to illustrate those parts of the law that are so 'well accepted' as to reflect emergent general rules. Of course, these cases may, by analogy and distinction, illuminate general principles at issue; but, purporting to limit the general rule to the facts of those cases is anathema to the common law. Stated otherwise, simply because in cases of factually-marginal applications courts have found evidence relating to alternative designs to be particularly probative and persuasive, in our minds, does not necessarily support a thesis that adducing such evidence is dispositive of whether a plaintiff has carried his/her burden of proof.... And, if adopted as a broadly applicable legal regime, the Third Restatement would engender a self-fulfilling prophecy by providing for a future restatement, going forward, of only those cases that meet the evidentiary threshold the regime permits.\" (Citation omitted.)\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4365747,6902174\" index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/104/328/\">\n    Id., at 413-14\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4365747,6902174\" index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/104/328/\">\n    104 A.3d 328\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Indeed, even the product liability defense bar has admitted that the controversy surrounding adoption of the Restatement (Third) has not abated.

Having undertaken that inquiry, we make the following clarifications.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   First, we agree that the labels of ordinary consumer expectation test and modified consumer expectation test are at best unhelpful and at worst misleading. To distinguish the tests in a manner more reflective of their application, we will call them the consumer expectation test and the risk-utility test. These labels also more closely conform to those used by many other jurisdictions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Second, although our risk-utility test permits a plaintiff to elect whether to proffer evidence of a reasonable alternative design, it would be helpful to require the plaintiff to allege, and thereby put the defendant on notice, whether the product is claimed to be unreasonably dangerous because (a) a reasonable alternative design could have reduced or avoided the danger, or (b) the design of the product marketed is manifestly unreasonable in that the risk of harm from the product so clearly exceeds its utility that a reasonable, informed consumer would not purchase the product, or (c) both. Under either theory, the jury weighs the product's risks and utility. Only under (a), however, would the jury consider the availability of an alternative design and compare that design's risks and utility to that of the product sold. Under (b), the jury would focus exclusively on the risks and utility of the product sold. We underscore that (b) is not limited to products of marginal utility; it applies to any product in which its risks clearly exceed its utility. The greater the utility, the greater the risk must be to render the product unreasonably dangerous. By segregating these risk-utility theories, we may gain a clearer picture of what, if any,\n   problems these theories present in practical application.\n   Third, we recognize that, in most cases, plaintiffs will elect to proceed on the theory that the product is unreasonably dangerous because it lacked some feature that would have reduced or avoided the injury. This narrative is the one that is likely to be most persuasive to a jury, and not many products will be more dangerous than useful or fail to meet minimum safety expectations. Therefore, it would be helpful to clarify the plaintiff's burden of proof on this theory. In order to state a prima facie case that will permit the case to be submitted to the jury, the plaintiff must simply prove that the alternative design was feasible (technically and economically) and that the alternative would have reduced or avoided the harm. Although other factors may be relevant; see part II E of this opinion; a plaintiff's failure to present proof on other factors will not preclude the case from being submitted to the jury. We underscore that, as to economic feasibility, the plaintiff need not prove the precise cost of the alternative design. The plaintiff only need proffer sufficient evidence from which a jury could reasonably conclude that any increase in cost would not materially affect the desirability of the product in light of the benefit derived.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   Fourth, we conclude that a defect may be established under our consumer expectation test by proof of the product's noncompliance with safety statutes or regulations or a product seller's express representations. Such noncompliance would establish the product's failure to meet consumers' legitimate, commonly accepted, minimum safety expectations. Moreover, the utility of the product would not excuse such noncompliance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   E\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   In light of the clarifications in\n   <em>\n    Izzarelli\n   </em>\n   and this opinion, we summarize the standards that govern a product\n   liability claim, as that term is defined under our act.

This question requires us to consider the element of \u00a7 402A that imposes liability only when a product is in a \"defective condition unreasonably dangerous to the user or\n   consumer\"; 2 Restatement (Second), supra, \u00a7 402A (1), p. 347 ; and the definition in comment (i) of unreasonably dangerous as limited to products that are \"dangerous to an extent beyond that which would be contemplated by the ordinary consumer who purchases it, with the ordinary knowledge common to the community as to its characteristics.\" Id., comment (i), p. 352.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   Both parties agree that, under the Restatement (Second) and our act, a product liability claim may be brought under theories of strict liability and/or negligence. See footnote 17 of this opinion (setting forth statutory definition of product liability claim). The crux of the dispute is whether a single, unitary definition applies to all such claims, no matter the theory of recovery.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   The defendant contends that the sole definition of unreasonably dangerous is a product that is \"dangerous to an extent beyond that which would be contemplated by the ordinary consumer who purchases it ....\" 2 Restatement (Second), supra, \u00a7 402A, comment (i), p. 352. It argues that our case law and the act support a unified definition of product liability, which is consistent with the practice of most jurisdictions. It suggests that negligence allows the plaintiff to elect to prove an additional element of manufacturer fault to provide a more appealing narrative to the jury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   The plaintiff clarified at oral argument before this court that, even under a theory of negligence, he effectively must prove that the product is in a defective condition unreasonably dangerous to the user. Nonetheless, he argues that the proof to establish this fact differs under negligence. He argues that common-law negligence requires proof that the manufacturer breached its duty by failing to exercise reasonable care under the circumstances, not by failing to meet consumers' expectations. He contends that to conclude otherwise\n   would preclude valid claims for injuries sustained by unintended but foreseeable users, like children who should have been protected by safety features that the ordinary consumer would not expect or require.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   We agree with the defendant that no product liability action can succeed without proof of a defective condition unreasonably dangerous to the consumer or user. See Connecticut Civil Jury Instructions (4th Ed. 2012) \u00a7 3.10-1, available at http://www.jud.ct.gov/JI/Civil/Civil.pdf; 1 American Law of Products Liability (3d Ed. 2009) \u00a7 10:17, p. 37 (\"[w]hether a claim of liability against a product manufacturer is based on negligence or on some other theory of liability, the manufacturer is liable only when the product is so defective as to render it 'unreasonably dangerous' \"). Indeed, even before this court's\n   adoption of \u00a7 402A, no action alleging injuries caused by the manufacture or design of a product based on negligence and/or warranty theories succeeded without evidence to this effect.

In limiting our measure to the expense of litigation less taxable costs, the court noted that under the typical [common-law] rule the jury was permitted to exercise a virtually unchecked discretion to award damages not only to make the injured person whole, but to punish the wrongdoer.... The court further recognized that the doctrine of punitive damages which permits recovery beyond compensation prevailed in most jurisdictions, but, nonetheless, it refused to adopt such a rule characterizing it as a hybrid between a display of ethical indignation and the imposition of a criminal fine....

Several concerns arise from this construction. First, attorney's fees under \u00a7 52-240a are not capped, as are punitive damages in \u00a7 52-240b. It is difficult to fathom why the legislature would have deemed the defendant's assertion of a frivolous defense to merit a harsher penalty than the defendant's injury causing reckless disregard for others' safety. Second, in cases in which a prevailing plaintiff has established both reckless disregard of safety and frivolous litigation conduct, the defendant would not be penalized for one of those wrongful acts. Which wrongful act was punished would depend on which statute provided greater recovery. In either case, one statute's purpose would not be fulfilled. Thus, unsurprisingly, in the only case in which a prevailing plaintiff sought to recover under both \u00a7\u00a7 52-240a and 52-240b, the trial court did not interpret the latter as subject to the common-law rule.

The proposed provision provided no cap on punitive damages and provided instead various factors that the court should consider in fixing the proper award. See Substitute House Bill 5870, \u00a7 8; see also footnote 26 of this opinion. None of these factors related to litigation costs, but instead related to the wrongfulness of the defendant's conduct and the financial impact of that award and like awards on the defendant.\n   <footnotemark>\n    26\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thereafter, an amendment was adopted that substituted the cap on punitive damages in lieu of the unbridled discretion applying the various factors. See Substitute House Bill No. 5870, as amended by House Amendment A; 22 S. Proc., Pt. 14, 1979 Sess., p. 4626, remarks of Senator Salvatore C. DePiano (sponsor of act explaining that amendment would \"place a limitation on the amount of punitive damages that would be awarded\"). There is nothing to indicate that, in doing so, the legislature intended to change the meaning of \"punitive damages\" as used in the proposed bill. No legislator referred to litigation expenses. In fact, one\n   of the bill's sponsors recognized that, despite the amendment, the bill provided a benefit that had not previously been available to plaintiffs. See 22 H.R. Proc., Pt. 21, 1979 Sess., p. 7285, remarks of Representative Richard D. Tulisano (explaining that, in amendment, \"we have put a cap on potential punitive damages that were in there which are a benefit to individuals\"). As common-law punitive damages already were available for a tort committed in reckless disregard of another's rights, the statute must have provided some recovery that was not previously available.\n   We are mindful that the amendment eliminated the language providing that punitive damages could be awarded \"in addition to attorney's fees ....\" House Bill 5870, House Amendment A. There are numerous reasons, however, why that phrase may have been removed-it was not in the model law, it was superfluous because of the provision expressly providing for attorney's fees, or it might suggest that attorney's fees and punitive damages should be awarded on the same basis. We are not persuaded that the inclusion and then removal of this phrase is persuasive evidence either way. Therefore, we conclude that the legislative history lends no support to the defendant's construction and instead supports what the language of the statute strongly indicates-that statutory punitive damages are not measured by the common-law rule.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   We answer the first certified question \"No.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   We answer the second certified question \"No.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   No costs shall be taxed in this court to either party.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   In this opinion ROGERS, C.J., and EVELEIGH and ROBINSON, Js., concurred.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   ZARELLA, J., with whom ESPINOSA, J., joins, concurring.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   I agree with the majority's answers to the two\n   certified questions from the United States District Court for the District of Connecticut, but, in light of my conclusion in my concurring opinion in\n   <em>\n    Izzarelli\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    R.J.

Conn. February 14, 2014). The plaintiff in the present case, Vincent Bifolck, individually and as executor of the estate of Jeanette D. Bifolck, brought a product liability action against the defendant, Philip Morris, Inc., in federal court, alleging that the defendant's cigarettes were defectively designed and that this design defect caused the plaintiff's harm. The plaintiff seeks to prove his case using a negligence theory of liability. The District Court has asked us to clarify the proper standard for determining defectiveness that should apply to the plaintiff's claim. The parties agree that, to succeed on his claim, the plaintiff must prove that the defendant's cigarette design was \"unreasonably dangerous,\" but they disagree about the standard for determining whether a product is unreasonably dangerous in a negligence action. The defendant argues that the \"ordinary consumer expectations test\" in comment (i) to \u00a7 402A of the Restatement (Second), and its \"good tobacco\" exception, should be used to determine whether a product is unreasonably dangerous in the context of a negligence based claim and that this test precludes a finding of liability in the present case. The plaintiff disagrees\n   that \u00a7 402A of the Restatement (Second), which is a strict liability test, should apply to his negligence claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   Like the majority, I also conclude that \u00a7 402A of the Restatement (Second) does not apply to the plaintiff's claim, but I disagree with the majority's basis for this\n   conclusion in light of my concurring opinion in\n   <em>\n    Izzarelli\n   </em>\n   .

The Restatement (Third) eliminates reliance on \u00a7 402A's consumer expectations standards and, instead, adopts a risk-utility test as the proper liability standard for all design defect claims.

The Restatement (Third) instead defines its design defect test \"functionally,\" based on the unique considerations involved in design defect claims. (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., at 231,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"211\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=136%20A.3d%201232\">\n    136 A.3d 1232\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Zarella\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    J.\n   </em>\n   , concurring), quoting Restatement (Third), supra, \u00a7 2, comment (n), p. 35. Unlike the approach of the Restatement (Second), the Restatement (Third) acknowledges that design defect claims present different considerations than other types of product defect claims, like those involving manufacturing defects and, therefore, require a different test. See Restatement (Third), supra, \u00a7 2, comment (a), p. 15; id., comment (n), p. 35. To address the fundamental and unique question presented in design defect cases-whether the manufacturer's\n   design was reasonably safe-the Restatement (Third) adopts a risk-utility test, which is essentially a negligence style reasonableness balancing test that allows a jury to consider the reasonableness of the manufacturer's design choice in light of available alternatives. Id., comment (d), pp. 19-20; id., comment (f), pp. 23-24; id., comment (n), pp. 35-36; see also\n   <em>\n    Izzarelli\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    R.J.

The Restatement (Third) recognizes that the risk-utility analysis is functionally equivalent to the analysis applicable to a negligence claim-each asks whether the manufacturer's design choice was reasonable in light of available alternatives or the risks presented by the product design. Consequently, it is unnecessary, under the Restatement (Third), to send both theories of liability to a jury; rather, the Restatement (Third) adopts the broader risk-utility test as the appropriate standard for design defect claims.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   See\n   <em>\n    Izzarelli\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    R.J.

In addressing the certified question, the majority acknowledges authorities concluding that instructing a jury on both a risk-utility and a negligence theory of recovery might result in inconsistent verdicts, but the majority declines to decide whether negligence should survive as an independent theory of recovery in this jurisdiction. See footnote 23 of the majority opinion. In my view, this leaves unnecessary uncertainty for this case and for future cases in which parties may intend to file design defect claims based on a negligence theory. Rather than leave this uncertainty in our law, I would make clear in answering the first certified question that, for the reasons stated in my concurring opinion in\n   <em>\n    Izzarelli\n   </em>\n   , the plaintiff's design defect claims are not governed by comment (i) to \u00a7 402A of the Restatement (Second) but by the risk-utility test set forth in the Restatement (Third). See\n   <em>\n    Izzarelli\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co.\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"214\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=321%20Conn.%20172\">\n    321 Conn. at 231-39\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"215\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=136%20A.3d%201232\">\n    136 A.3d 1232\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Zarella\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    J.\n   </em>\n   , concurring).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   Applying the Restatement (Third) in the present case, I conclude that \u00a7 402A of the Restatement (Second) and its ordinary consumer expectations test should no longer apply to claims involving design defects existing at the time of sale, and, thus, \u00a7 402A does not control the plaintiff's claim in the present case. Because the Restatement (Third) no longer recognizes a stand-alone negligence theory of recovery for design defect claims, I would further conclude that the plaintiff must proceed under the risk-utility test. See Restatement (Third), supra, \u00a7 2, comment (n), pp. 35-36; see also\n   <em>\n    Izzarelli\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    R.J.

Consequently, I would answer the first certified question in the negative, as the majority does, but for markedly different reasons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   With respect to the second certified question, regarding the measure of punitive damages under General Statutes \u00a7 52-240b, I agree with the majority's answer and generally agree with its analysis. I write separately to emphasize that I find the answer to this question to be an extremely close call. As the defendant argues, there is a strong presumption against construing a statute to override the common law. See, e.g.,\n   <em>\n    Ames\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Commissioner of Motor Vehicles\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2629333\" index=\"218\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/267/524/#p532\">\n    267 Conn. 524\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 532,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"219\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=839%20A.2d%201250\">\n    839 A.2d 1250\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2004) ;\n   <em>\n    Lynn\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Haybuster Mfg., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"738696\" index=\"220\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/226/282/#p290\">\n    226 Conn. 282\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 290,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"221\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=627%20A.2d%201288\">\n    627 A.2d 1288\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1993). This presumption is especially strong when the common-law principle at issue is our well established, 200 year old method for calculating punitive damage awards, which limits such awards to attorney's fees less taxable costs. When considering the effect of a statute on a common-law principle, we must attempt to harmonize our construction of the statute with the common law, to the extent reasonably possible, unless the statutory language shows a clear intention to displace the common law. See, e.g.,\n   <em>\n    Ames\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Commissioner of Motor Vehicles\n   </em>\n   , supra, at 532,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"222\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=839%20A.2d%201250\">\n    839 A.2d 1250\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (noting that our construction of statutes must avoid \"any innovation [on] the common law [that a statute] does not fairly express\" [internal quotation marks omitted] ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   In the present case, I am persuaded that the legislature intended to adopt an approach that is different from the common law with respect to punitive damages calculations, principally in light of its decision to include a separate provision in the act providing for an award of attorney's fees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   See General Statutes \u00a7 52-240a. I share the majority's concerns that arise from construing \u00a7\u00a7 52-240a and 52-240b as both allowing awards of attorney's fees but under different conditions. As the majority explains, under such a construction, if a prevailing plaintiff established both reckless disregard\n   of the safety of product users, consumers, and others who are injured by a product, and that a defense raised was frivolous, limiting the plaintiff's award under both statutes to his attorney's fees effectively compensates the plaintiff for only one of the defendant's wrongful actions, which would appear to frustrate the purpose of these statutes. I therefore am persuaded that \u00a7 52-240b, considered together with other provisions of the act, fairly expresses an intention to depart from the common-law rule regarding the calculation of punitive damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   III\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   In conclusion, I agree with the majority that \u00a7 402A of the Restatement (Second) does not apply to the plaintiff's claim, and, therefore, I would answer the first certified question in the negative. I would also make clear, however, that the proper standard governing the plaintiff's claim is the risk-utility standard set forth in \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 2 of the Restatement (Third). With respect to the second certified question, I concur in the majority's reasoning and answer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   VERTEFEUILLE, J., concurring and dissenting.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   I agree with the majority opinion insofar as it concludes that \u00a7 402A of the Restatement (Second) of Torts applies to a product liability claim for negligence under Connecticut's Product Liability Act (act), General Statutes \u00a7 52-572m et seq. I disagree, however, with the majority's conclusion in part IV of its opinion that our common-law rule of punitive damages does not apply to an award of statutory punitive damages pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 52-240b.

Accordingly, we may look to the legislative history of the act to determine the scope and meaning of that term. See General Statutes \u00a7 1-2z. This legislative history supports the conclusion that \u00a7 52-240b was not intended to abrogate the common-law rule of punitive damages. The legislature considered a bill that specifically provided that, if the claimant proved that the harm suffered was the result of reckless disregard for the safety of product users, punitive damages could be awarded \"\n   <em>\n    in addition to attorney's fees ....\n   </em>\n   \" (Emphasis added.)

See Substitute House Bill No. 5870, as amended by House Amendment A, \u00a7 8 (a). It is reasonable to conclude that this was done because the legislature was aware that, under the common law of this state, punitive damages\n   <em>\n    consist of\n   </em>\n   attorney's\n   fees.\n   <em>\n    Alvarez\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    New Haven Register, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"518097\" index=\"253\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/249/709/#p715\">\n    249 Conn. at 722\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"254\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=735%20A.2d%20306\">\n    735 A.2d 306\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[t]he legislature is presumed to be aware of this court's decisions and, therefore, the common-law limitations on the [defendant's] liability already in place\"). Thus, the most reasonable explanation for the intentional deletion of such language from \u00a7 52-240b is that the legislature intended that, for purposes of the act, the existing common-law limitation would apply to punitive damages. See\n   <em>\n    Izzarelli\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    R.J.

If the legislature had intended to authorize an award of punitive damages over and above litigation expenses, I can perceive no reason why it would have deliberately declined to provide the court with objective criteria by\n   which it could determine the amount of such an award.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   See\n   <em>\n    Izzarelli\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    R.J.

In light of this\n   concern, it would have been entirely reasonable for the legislature to adopt the common-law limitation on punitive damages and, in addition, to cap such damages at twice the compensatory award in order to limit liability in cases where the compensatory damages-and, presumably, the injuries-are small, but the litigation expenses are large.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Accordingly, I would conclude that \"punitive damages\" as used in \u00a7 52-240b has the same meaning as under\n   our common law, namely, litigation expenses, such as attorney's fees, less taxable costs.\n   <em>\n    Hylton\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Gunter\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"257\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=313%20Conn.%20472\">\n    313 Conn. at 484\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"258\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=97%20A.3d%20970\">\n    97 A.3d 970\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-142\">\n   Accordingly, I respectfully dissent from part IV of the majority opinion.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-147\">\n    Although the act commonly refers to General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 52-572m through 52-572q, which sets forth certain procedural and substantive requirements of product liability actions, the public act enacting these provisions, Public Acts 1979, No. 79-483, also enacted provisions codified at General Statutes \u00a7 52-577a, prescribing the statute of limitations and period of repose for product liability actions, and General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 52-240a and 52-240b, respectively prescribing attorney's fees and punitive damages for such actions.

Such a defense is not available, however, for a claim under our act.

See Restatement (Third), supra, \u00a7 2, comment (n), pp. 35-36 (\"[T]wo or more factually identical design-defect claims ... should not be submitted to the trier of fact in the same case under different doctrinal labels. Regardless of the doctrinal label attached to a particular claim, design ... claims rest on a risk-utility assessment. To allow two or more factually identical risk-utility claims to go to a jury under different labels, whether 'strict liability,' 'negligence,' or 'implied warranty of merchantability,' would generate confusion and may well result in inconsistent verdicts.\"); see also id., \u00a7 2, reporters' note, comment (n), pp. 107-109 (citing cases).

In making such determination, the court shall consider: (1) The likelihood at the time of manufacture that a serious harm would arise from the product seller's misconduct, (2) the degree of the product seller's awareness of such likelihood of harm, (3) the profitability of the misconduct to the product seller, (4) the duration of the misconduct and any concealment of it by the product seller, (5) the attitude and conduct of the product seller upon discovery of the misconduct, (6) the financial condition of the product seller, and (7) the total effect of other punishment imposed or likely to be imposed upon the product seller as a result of the misconduct, including punitive damage awards to persons similarly situated to the claimant and the severity of criminal penalties to which the product seller has been or may be subjected.\"\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-181\">\n    Accordingly, I disagree with the majority's statement that \"[t]here is nothing to indicate that [in deleting the relevant language providing criteria for determining the amount of punitive damages], the legislature intended to change the meaning of 'punitive damages' as used in the proposed bill.\" If the legislature intended to reject the common-law limitation on punitive damages, there would have been no reason for it to delete the proposed language.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-182\">\n    See Proposed House Bill No. 5870, 1979 Sess.

In light of the overriding legislative intent to rebalance product liability law in favor of defendants, it is more reasonable to conclude that the legislature intended to adopt the common-law limitation.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"6\">\n   <p id=\"p-184\">\n    The majority points out that the legislature imposed no such cap in General \u00a7 52-240a, which authorizes an award of attorney's fees to the prevailing party if the court determines that a claim or defense was frivolous; see footnote 1 of this concurring and dissenting opinion; and contends that it is unlikely that \"the legislature would have deemed the defendant's assertion of a frivolous defense to merit a harsher penalty than the defendant's injury causing reckless disregard for others' safety.\" The majority fails to recognize, however, that \u00a7 52-240a provides a two-edged sword: although it allows for full recovery of attorney's fees from a defendant who raises a frivolous defense, it also allows for full recovery of such fees from a plaintiff who raises a frivolous claim. Thus, the provision maintains balance in product liability law. In contrast, authorizing for the first time an award of broad punitive damages would have altered the existing balance in favor of plaintiffs, thereby exacerbating the economic problem that the act was intended to alleviate.
