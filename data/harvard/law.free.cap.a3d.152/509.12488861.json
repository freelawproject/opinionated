The defendants filed separate motions to dismiss the plaintiff's complaint claiming that only \"individual activities or a sequence of planned activities proposed to be undertaken by state departments, institutions or agencies, or funded in whole or in part by the state, which could have a major impact on the state's\" environmental resources; General Statutes \u00a7 22a-1c ; constitute \"actions which may significantly affect the environment\" for purposes of \u00a7 22a-1b (c). Because they did not undertake any such activities, the defendants claimed, no environmental impact evaluation was required. The trial court agreed with the defendants and rendered judgment dismissing the complaint. The plaintiff claims on appeal\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   to this court that the trial court improperly determined that the defendants' activities did not constitute \"actions which may significantly\n   affect the environment\" for purposes of \u00a7 22a-1b (c). We disagree with the plaintiff, and affirm the judgment of the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The record reveals the following facts, which are undisputed or were found by the trial court, and procedural history. In 2011, the legislature enacted General Statutes \u00a7 16a-3d, which directs the Commissioner of Energy and Environmental Protection to prepare a comprehensive energy strategy for the state every three years.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   See\n   Public Acts 2011, No. 11-80,\n   \u00a7 51.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Pursuant to this directive, the department\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   issued a document entitled \"2013 Comprehensive Energy Strategy for Connecticut\" (comprehensive energy strategy) on February 19, 2013. As part of the comprehensive energy strategy, the department recommended a significant expansion of the use of natural gas in the state.\n   This proposal would require the expansion of natural gas pipeline capacity into the state, regulatory changes to enable certain customers to have their connections financed by the state's gas companies, the construction of approximately 900 miles of gas mains to provide access to consumers, and incentives for the state's gas companies to \"ramp-up the required construction quickly ....\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The department also recommended that the state's gas companies submit a detailed conversion plan to the department and the authority. The department would then review the plan for consistency with the goals of the comprehensive energy strategy and the authority would assess the plan's potential impact on ratepayers. In June, 2013, the legislature enacted General Statutes \u00a7 16-19ww, adopting the department's recommendations. See Public Acts 2013, No. 13-298, \u00a7 51.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Thereafter, Southern Connecticut Gas Company, Connecticut Natural Gas Corporation, and Yankee Gas Services Company (local distribution companies) submitted to the defendants a Joint Natural Gas Infrastructure Expansion Plan (expansion plan). The department found the expansion plan \"to be generally consistent with the [comprehensive energy strategy] goals,\" but recommended several modifications. The local distribution companies made the recommended modifications and resubmitted the modified expansion plan to the defendants, at which time the authority commenced a contested case to investigate the plan's impact on ratepayers pursuant to \u00a7 16-19ww (c).\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   During the\n   course of that proceeding, two parties submitted letters to the authority contending that the authority was required to prepare an environmental impact evaluation pursuant to \u00a7 22a-1b (c). In response, the authority issued a notice of request for written comments on that issue. The department submitted a letter to the authority contending that an environmental impact evaluation was not required because the authority was not the sponsoring agency for the proposed expansion of the natural gas distribution system, it was not funding the proposed expansion, it was not performing the proposed expansion and it would have no ownership interest in the proposed facilities. The authority issued a final decision approving the expansion plan without requiring an environmental impact evaluation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The plaintiff, a trade association of more than 500 energy marketers who sell gasoline and heating fuel to residential and commercial customers throughout the state, then brought this action pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 22a-16\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   in 2014 claiming\n   that the expansion plan would increase the amount of natural gas escaping into the atmosphere, thereby exacerbating global warming,\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   and that it would also have other negative impacts on\n   the state's environmental resources. The plaintiff sought a declaratory judgment that the defendants had violated the act by failing to conduct an assessment of environmental significance or to prepare an environmental impact evaluation pursuant to \u00a7 22a-1b (c). The plaintiff also sought an injunction requiring the defendants to perform those acts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The department filed a motion to dismiss or to strike the plaintiff's complaint claiming, among other things, that the department had not undertaken any \" 'actions which may significantly affect the environment,' \" as that term is defined in \u00a7 22a-1c, that would require the preparation of an environmental impact evaluation pursuant to \u00a7 22a-1b (c). The authority filed a separate motion to dismiss raising the same claim. The trial court concluded that, because the defendants were merely acting pursuant to the legislative directives contained in \u00a7\u00a7 16a-3d and 16-19ww, their conduct did not come within the definition set forth in \u00a7 22a-1c and they were not required to prepare an environmental impact evaluation. Accordingly, the trial court concluded that the plaintiff had failed to state a claim pursuant to the act and rendered judgment dismissing the complaint on the ground that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction under the doctrine of sovereign immunity.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The plaintiff contends that the trial court incorrectly concluded that the department's preparation of the comprehensive energy strategy and the approval of the expansion plan by both the department and the authority were not \" 'actions which may significantly affect the environment' \"; General Statutes \u00a7 22a-1c ; requiring an environmental impact evaluation pursuant to \u00a7 22a-1b. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The question of whether the trial court properly dismissed the plaintiff's complaint turns on the proper interpretation of the phrase \" 'actions which may significantly affect the environment' \" as used in \u00a7 22a-1c, which is an issue of statutory interpretation that presents a question of law.\n   <em>\n    Fairchild Heights Residents Assn., Inc.\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Fairchild Heights, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=310%20Conn.%20797\">\n    310 Conn. 797\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 808-809,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=82%20A.3d%20602\">\n    82 A.3d 602\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2014). \"[A]n agency's factual and discretionary determinations are to be accorded considerable weight by the courts....

In other words, we seek to determine, in a reasoned manner, the meaning of the statutory language as applied to the facts of [the] case, including the question of whether the language actually does apply.... In seeking to determine that meaning, General Statutes \u00a7 1-2z directs us first to consider the text of the statute itself and its relationship to other statutes. If, after examining such text and considering such relationship, the meaning of such text is plain and unambiguous and does not yield absurd or unworkable results,\n   extratextual evidence of\n   the meaning of the statute shall not be considered.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Fairchild Heights Residents Assn., Inc.\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Fairchild Heights, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=310%20Conn.%20797\">\n    310 Conn. at 809\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=82%20A.3d%20602\">\n    82 A.3d 602\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   We begin our analysis with the language of the relevant statutes. Section 22a-1b (c) provides in relevant part that \"[e]ach state department, institution or agency responsible for the primary recommendation or initiation of actions which may significantly affect the environment shall in the case of each such proposed action make a detailed written evaluation of its environmental impact before deciding whether to undertake or approve such action ....\" Section 22a-1c provides in relevant part that, \"[a]s used in sections 22a-1 to 22a-1i, inclusive, 'actions which may significantly affect the environment' means individual activities or a sequence of planned activities proposed to be undertaken by state departments, institutions or agencies, or funded in whole or in part by the state, which could have a major impact on the state's land, water, air, historic structures and landmarks as defined in section 10-410, existing housing, or other environmental resources, or could serve short term to the disadvantage of long term environmental goals....\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Thus, \u00a7 22a-1c provides that, to constitute \" 'actions which may significantly affect the environment' \" for purposes of \u00a7 22a-1b (c), activities must both (1) be \"proposed to be undertaken by state departments, institutions or agencies, or funded in whole or in part by the state,\" and (2) potentially \"have a major impact on the state's\" environmental resources. The most natural reading of the phrase \"proposed to be undertaken by an agency or agencies\" is that the proposed or initiated activity that will allegedly have a major impact on the state's environment ultimately must \"\n   <em>\n    be undertaken by\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    an agency or agencies.\n   </em>\n   \"\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Emphasis added.)

Thus, activities that are proposed by state actors, but which are ultimately performed by private entities, do not constitute \"actions which may significantly affect the environment\" for purposes of \u00a7 22a-1b (c).\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   This interpretation is supported by the legislative genealogy of the act. When the legislature originally enacted the act in 1973, the legislation provided that \"[a]ctions which may significantly affect the environment shall include those projects\n   <em>\n    directly undertaken by state departments, institutions or agencies\n   </em>\n   , or funded in whole or in part by the state ....\" (Emphasis added.) Public Acts 1973, No. 73-562, \u00a7 3 (P.A. 73-562). The legislative history of\n   P.A. 73- 562 indicates that the purpose of the legislation was to \"[put] our state government and [its] agencies on the same footing in responsibility as our public and private industries.\" 16 H.R. Proc., Pt. 14, 1973 Sess., p. 7182, remarks of Representative Harold G. Harlow.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thus, the legislature believed that, when the proposed activities are to be undertaken by private entities, there would be no reason to apply the act to the activities because private entities are already held responsible for the environmental impact of their activities under other laws.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In 1977, the legislature amended the act by replacing the phrase \"shall include those projects directly\" with the phrase \"are defined for the purposes of section 22a-1b as individual activities or a sequence of planned activities proposed to be ....\" Public Acts 1977, No. 77-514, \u00a7 3 (P.A. 77-514). It is reasonable to conclude that the purpose of this amendment was to clarify that, if a state actor is considering whether it should undertake activities that could have a major impact on the state's environmental resources, the state actor should prepare an environmental impact evaluation\n   <em>\n    before\n   </em>\n   actually\n   undertaking the activities.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   Indeed, at the same time that the legislature amended this portion of the act, it amended the portion now codified as \u00a7 22a-1b (c) to provide that state actors must prepare an environmental impact evaluation \"\n   <em>\n    before\n   </em>\n   deciding whether to undertake or approve\" activities that may significantly affect the environment. (Emphasis added.) P.A. 77-514, \u00a7 2 (b). Nothing in the legislative history of P.A. 77-514 suggests that the legislature's intent was to substantially change the primary purpose of the 1973 legislation by making it applicable to proposed activities that are to be undertaken by private actors. Cf.\n   <em>\n    Doe\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Doe\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"104119\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/244/403/#p434\">\n    244 Conn. 403\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 434,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=710%20A.2d%201297\">\n    710 A.2d 1297\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1998) ( \"[w]e ordinarily do\n   not infer a legislative intent to change [long-standing] and fundamental legislative policies without a clear indication of such an intent\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   In the present case, the defendants have not proposed to undertake or to fund the activities that the plaintiff alleges will have a major impact on the state's environmental resources, namely, the construction of new gas pipelines in the state resulting in the increased discharge of methane gas into the atmosphere. Rather, these activities will be undertaken and funded by the local distribution companies, which are private entities. Accordingly, we conclude that the trial court properly granted the defendants' motions to dismiss on the ground that the requirement of an environmental impact evaluation in \u00a7 22a-1b (c) does not apply to their activities in the present case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   In support of its claim to the contrary, the plaintiff relies on \u00a7 22a-1a-1 (2) of the Regulations of Connecticut State Agencies, which defines an \"action,\" as that word is used in General Statutes \u00a7 22a-1b (c), as an \"individual activity or a sequence of planned activities\n   <em>\n    initiated or proposed\n   </em>\n   to be undertaken by an agency or agencies, or funded in whole or in part by the state.\" (Emphasis added.) Regs., Conn. State Agencies \u00a7 22a-1a-1 (2). The plaintiff contends that, under this regulation, an agency engages in an \"action\" when it initiates or proposes an activity that will be undertaken by any entity.\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thus, the plaintiff contends that \u00a7 22a-1a-1 (2) of the regulations, and, by extension, General Statutes \u00a7 22a-1c, should be interpreted to apply to an individual activity or a sequence of planned activities to be undertaken by any person or entity that is initiated or proposed by an agency. Because the department proposed the expansion of the use of natural gas in the state when it prepared the comprehensive energy strategy, the plaintiff argues, the local distribution companies' expansion plan was subject to the requirements of General Statutes \u00a7 22a-1b (c). We disagree. The plaintiff's interpretation would both require the insertion of words such as \"to be undertaken by any person or entity\" into \u00a7 22a-1a-1 (2) of the regulations and General Statutes \u00a7 22a-1c and render the existing phrase \"to be undertaken\" superfluous.

State Agencies \u00a7 22a-1a-1 (2). Because the department exercised judgment in preparing the comprehensive energy strategy, and because both defendants exercised judgment in approving the expansion plan, the plaintiff contends, those activities were \" 'action[s]' \" subject to \u00a7 22a-1b (c).\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n   Again,\n   we disagree. This portion of the regulation was intended to implement the portion of \u00a7 22a-1c providing that \u00a7 22a-1b (c) does not apply to \"activities in which state agency participation is ministerial in nature, involving no exercise of discretion on the part of the state department, institution or agency.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n   General Statutes \u00a7 22a-1c. That\n   language provides an exemption to the portion of \u00a7 22a-1c providing that \"[s]uch actions shall include but not be limited to new projects and programs of state agencies and new projects supported by state contracts and grants ....\" In turn, \"[s]uch actions,\" as used in this portion of \u00a7 22a-1c, refers back to \"activities proposed to be undertaken by state departments, institutions or agencies, or funded in whole or in part by the state ....\" Thus, \u00a7 22a-1a-1 (2) of the regulations applies only to activities that will be undertaken or funded by a state actor. Because the activities that the plaintiff alleges will cause major pollution will be undertaken by private parties, the defendants' activities in proposing and approving those activities do not fall within this definition regardless of whether they are discretionary or ministerial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   To the extent that the plaintiff contends that \u00a7 22a-1a-1 (2) of the regulations broadens the definition of \" 'actions which may significantly affect the environment' \" set forth in General Statutes \u00a7 22a-1c, we disagree. For the reasons that we have already explained, we do not believe that the language of the regulation is broader than the statute. Indeed, all of the specific examples of \"actions\" subject to \u00a7 22a-1b (c) set forth in \u00a7 22a-1a-1 (2) of the regulations involve actions to be undertaken or funded by state actors.\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Citing this court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Manchester Environmental Coalition\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Stockton\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"556223\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/184/51/#p63\">\n    184 Conn. 51\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 63,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=441%20A.2d%2068\">\n    441 A.2d 68\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1981), overruled in part on other grounds by\n   <em>\n    Waterbury\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Washington\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"831937\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/260/506/#p556\">\n    260 Conn. 506\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 556,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=800%20A.2d%201102\">\n    800 A.2d 1102\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2002), the plaintiff also contends that we should\n   construe \u00a7\u00a7 22a-1b (c) and 22a-1c consistently with the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%204331\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 4331\n   </extracted-citation>\n   et seq.

Of particular relevance here, NEPA does not define \"[f]ederal actions,\" as that term is used in 42 U.S.C \u00a7 4332 (2)(C),\n   <footnotemark>\n    22\n   </footnotemark>\n   as \"activities proposed to be undertaken by\" federal actors. Compare General Statutes \u00a7 22a-1c. Rather, the implementing regulations for NEPA define \"[f]ederal actions\" broadly to \"include new and continuing activities, including projects and programs entirely or partly financed, assisted, conducted, regulated,\n   <em>\n    or approved\n   </em>\n   by federal agencies; new or revised agency rules,\n   regulations, plans, policies, or procedures;\n   <em>\n    and legislative proposals\n   </em>\n   .\" (Emphasis added.)\n   <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=40%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201508.18\">\n    40 C.F.R. \u00a7 1508.18\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . We conclude, therefore, that the scope of the \"[f]ederal actions\" that are subject to NEPA is broader than the scope of activities by state actors that are subject to the act. If the legislature had intended for the term \"actions which may significantly affect the environment\" to have the same meaning under the act as the term \"[f]ederal actions\" has under NEPA, it easily could have expressly provided so in \u00a7 22a-1c.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The plaintiff further contends that, because the act is remedial in nature, we should construe it liberally.

The language of the regulation clearly tracks the language of \u00a7 22a-1c. In any event, even if the plaintiff were correct, the word \"actions\" and the phrase \"such action\" as used in this portion of \u00a7 22a-1b (c) refer to \"activities proposed to be undertaken by state departments, institutions or agencies, or funded in whole or in part by the state\"; General Statutes \u00a7 22a-1c ; and we have concluded that this language refers to activities that ultimately will be undertaken by a state actor. This interpretation does not render the phrase \"or approve\" as used in \u00a7 22a-1b (c) superfluous, because that portion of the statute contemplates the situation in which a state actor conducts proceedings to determine whether it is authorized to and, if so, whether it should undertake certain activities before actually undertaking the activities.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"20\">\n   <p id=\"p-95\">\n    Section 22a-1a-1 (2) of the Regulations of Connecticut State Agencies provides in relevant part: \"Actions include, but are not limited to, capital improvements, alterations, repairs, or additions to the real property of the state; acquisition of real property for the purpose of capital improvements; [and] lease/purchase agreements; grants-in-aid or financial assistance for housing, business, industry, restoration or demonstration projects ....\"\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"21\">\n   <p id=\"p-96\">\n    In\n    <em>\n     Manchester Environmental Coalition\n    </em>\n    , this court relied on the remarks of Senator Philip N.

First, respectfully, in my view, this is not an issue of sovereign immunity and the case should not have been dismissed on that basis. If, in fact, the case did not state a cause of action, as held by the trial court, the matter should have been subject to a motion to strike for failure to state a cause of action. I would return the matter to the trial court for further consideration on a motion to strike. Second, in my view, this case does state a cause of action. The trial court held that an environmental impact evaluation was only required \"for activities funded by or proposed to be undertaken by the state. The [2013 Comprehensive Energy Strategy for Connecticut (comprehensive energy strategy) issued by the department] was neither.\" The court further held that \"[b]ecause approval of the [comprehensive energy strategy] is not an action which may significantly affect the environment, as that phrase is defined in [General Statutes] \u00a7\u00a7 22a-1b (c) and 22a-1c, the plaintiff has failed to state a claim under the\n   [Environmental Policy Act (policy act), General Statutes \u00a7 22a-1 et seq. ].\" Section 22a-1a-1 (2) of the Regulations of Connecticut State Agencies, however, defines \"action\" as, inter alia, \"other proposed activity for which an agency exercises judgment or discretion as to the propriety of that action.\" This language is derived from \u00a7 22a-1b (c), which requires an agency to make a detailed written evaluation of any environmental impact \"before deciding whether to undertake or approve such action.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thus, the agency's approval of\n   an activity or sequence of proposed activities constitutes an \"action\" under the regulations if the activity may significantly affect the environment. Therefore, in my opinion, the present case does state a cause of action and should not have been dismissed. Rather, I would remand the matter to the trial court for a determination of whether the activity may significantly affect the environment. Therefore, I respectfully dissent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   I will not repeat the facts and procedural history since they are accurately reflected in the majority opinion.

By conferring standing on \"any person\" to challenge the failure of an agency to prepare an impact statement, \u00a7 22a-16 stands as an explicit waiver of sovereign immunity with respect to such actions.

Thus, they styled their motions as motions to dismiss, challenging the jurisdiction of the trial court on sovereign immunity grounds.

The most natural reading of the phrase 'proposed to be undertaken by an agency or agencies' is that the proposed or initiated activity that will allegedly have a major impact on the state's environment ultimately must 'be undertaken by an agency or agencies.' ... Thus, activities that are proposed by state actors, but which are ultimately performed by private entities, do not constitute 'actions which may significantly affect the environment' for purposes of \u00a7 22a-1b (c).\" (Citation omitted; emphasis omitted.) While I concede that the majority's interpretation of the statute is a reasonable one, I find equally persuasive the interpretation of the plaintiff that once the state engages in an action that may potentially affect the environment, said action will require an environmental impact evaluation. The definition of the terms \"action\" and \"proposed or initiated activity\" are therefore crucial to the inquiry. In other words, does the proposed or initiated activity ultimately have to be performed by a state agency and thus, necessarily meet the requirements of the statute, or is it enough to meet those requirements that the state initiates the mechanism by which the acts are ultimately performed by a private entity? I would conclude that, in light of the two reasonable interpretations, the statute is ambiguous. Therefore, I would resort to extratextual sources, including the regulations, which is appropriate under General Statutes \u00a7 1-2z. Although not expressly stating in the opinion that the statute is ambiguous, the majority's reliance upon legislative history and the regulations would suggest that it also finds the statute to be ambiguous.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Shortly after the policy act was enacted, the department promulgated regulations that drew upon\n   \u00a7\u00a7 22a- 1b (c) and 22a-1c to define in greater depth the type of \"actions which may significantly affect the environment.\"\n   General Statutes \u00a7 22a-1b (c). I respectfully disagree with the majority's position that \"[t]hus, activities that are proposed by state actors, but which are ultimately performed by private entities, do not constitute 'actions which may significantly affect the environment' for purposes of \u00a7 22a-1b (c).\" If that were the case, there would have been no need for the phrase \"activities proposed to be undertaken by state [actors] ....\" General Statutes \u00a7 22a-1c. The legislature could have merely stated that if the state is not paying for the project in whole or in part, any other actions of state departments are not actions which affect the environment. Instead, the legislature used the additional phrase of \"activities proposed to be undertaken by state [actors] ....\" General Statutes \u00a7 22a-1c. If the interpretation of the statute is the one proposed by the majority, this statutory language is superfluous because, according to both the majority and the trial court, unless the activity is funded in whole or in part by the state, it does not affect the environment and, therefore, an environmental impact evaluation is not necessary. The use of the word \"or\" in \u00a7 22a-1c belies this interpretation. Rather, as I view the relevant language in \u00a7 22a-1c, the definition of \" 'actions which may significantly affect the environment' \" should be read to include those projects either funded in whole or in part by the state, or those in which state actors proposed action. The department's regulatory definition, is set forth in \u00a7 22a-1a-1 (2) of the regulations, which provides in relevant part that \"[a]ction means an individual activity or a sequence of planned activities initiated or proposed to be undertaken by an agency or agencies, or funded in whole or in part by the state....\" Thus, under the applicable regulatory definition, an \"action\" is an \"activity\" or \"a sequence of planned activities\"\n   that are \"initiated\" or \"funded\" by an agency. Regs., Conn. State Agencies \u00a7 22a-1a-1 (2). The \"proposed to be undertaken\" language in \u00a7 22a-1a-1 (2) of the regulations is taken from \u00a7 22a-1c. The \"initiated\" language in \u00a7 22a-1a-1 (2) of the regulations is taken from the \"initiation of actions\" language of \u00a7 22a-1b (c).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Section 22a-1a-1 (2) of the regulations also includes within the applicable definition of \"action\" any \"other proposed activity for which an agency exercises judgment or discretion as to the propriety of that action.\" This language is derived from General Statutes \u00a7 22a-1b (c), which requires an agency to make a detailed written evaluation of environmental impact \"before deciding whether to undertake or approve such action.\" Thus, an agency's approval of an activity or sequence of proposed activities constitutes an \"action\" under the regulations if the activity may significantly affect the environment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   The essence of an \"action,\" therefore, is an activity or sequence of planned activities that may have a significant impact on the environment. But the activity or sequence of activities must be triggered by an act of a state department, institution or agency. Under the department's regulations, activities are triggered by state action when an agency proposes the activity or sequence of activities, when an agency initiates the activities by an authorizing act of approval or by other acts of implementation, or when an agency funds the activity, in whole or in part. See Regs., Conn. State Agencies \u00a7 22a-1a-1 (2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   The majority claims that such a reading \"would both require the insertion of words such as 'to be undertaken by any person or entity' into \u00a7 22a-1a-1 (2) of the regulations and General Statutes \u00a7 22a-1c and render the existing phrase 'to be undertaken' superfluous.\" I respectfully disagree. In my view, the regulations inform\n   the meaning of the word action and the activity necessary for the requirement of an\n   environmental impact evaluation to be instituted. If the state agency is the entity proposing the plan and exercising judgment over the plan, the regulations make it clear that an environmental impact evaluation should be completed regardless of what entity, public or private, ends up paying for the project. I further disagree with the majority's position that \u00a7 22a-1a-1 (2) of the regulations\"applies only to activities that will be undertaken or funded by a state actor.\" The majority further concludes that \"because the activities that the plaintiff alleges will cause major pollution will be undertaken by private parties, the defendants' activities in proposing and approving those activities do not fall within this definition regardless of whether they are discretionary or ministerial.\" Thus, my disagreement with the majority is regarding the \"activities proposed to be undertaken by [the] state\" language in General Statutes \u00a7 22a-1c. The majority views the activities as the actual project, whereas, in my view, the activities are the review and preparation of the plan upon which the ultimate project may be commenced. Indeed, as I have suggested previously in this opinion, if a state agency is involved in the project it obviously is either funded in whole or in part by the state. The majority's interpretation renders the \"activities proposed to be undertaken by [the] state\" language in \u00a7 22a-1c superfluous.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Moreover, I do not believe that the department's regulations run afoul of our jurisprudence by extending beyond the bounds of the statute. Rather, in my view, the regulations promulgated by the department inform the meanings of the relevant statutory provisions. Otherwise, the phrase \"individual activities or a sequence of planned activities proposed to be undertaken by state departments, institutions or agencies\" in General Statutes \u00a7 22a-1c becomes irrelevant, because all actions\n   of the state are funded in whole or in part by the state.

The purpose of the policy act cannot be fulfilled if activities that will adversely affect the environment are attributed to the legislature, and not to the agencies\n   that propose them for legislative approval. Thus, when an agency proposes an activity or sequence of planned activities that may significantly affect the environment, it must perform\n   an environmental impact evaluation to accompany the proposal. \"An environmental impact evaluation shall be prepared as close as possible to the time an agency proposes an action. The evaluation shall be prepared early enough so that it can practically serve as an important contribution to the decision-making process ....\" Regs., Conn. State Agencies \u00a7 22a-1a-7 (b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   The trial court's memorandum of decision in the present case contains no discussion of what constitutes an action by an administrative agency or executive department that may \"significantly affect the environment.\" Instead, the trial court focused on the act of the legislature approving the comprehensive energy strategy. It held that such legislative approval is not an \"action\" under the policy act. In substance, the trial court concluded that, \"[u]ltimately, the [p]olicy [a]ct only requires an [environmental impact evaluation] for activities funded by or proposed to be undertaken by the state. The [comprehensive energy strategy] was neither. Because approval of the [comprehensive energy strategy] is not an action which may significantly affect the environment, as that phrase is defined in \u00a7\u00a7 22a-1b (c) and 22a-1c, the plaintiff has failed to state a claim under the [p]olicy [a]ct.\" The discussion of the trial court preceding this holding suggests that the department, through the authority, played no role in formulating and proposing a natural gas conversion energy strategy, initiating the strategy through a series of discretionary determinations, approving and modifying the expansion plan, and issuing orders necessary for its implementation. According to the trial court, \"the defendants simply followed the legislative duties imposed upon them.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   The trial court proceeds as if the department performed a series of ministerial duties directed by the legislature with no authorization to make discretionary determinations, especially determinations crucial to whether a natural gas conversion plan would ever by\n   implemented. Implicit in the trial court's holding is that the broad statement of objectives enunciated by the legislature could be translated into a concrete natural gas conversion plan, and be implemented, in the absence of discretionary determinations by an agency or agencies. I disagree with this interpretation. The department conceived of and implemented the natural gas conversion program in a way that is different only in form, but not in substance, from the way that administrative agencies normally formulate and implement programs authored by the legislature. Typically, the legislature devises a program by stating broad goals, objectives, and strategies, and it delegates to one or more agencies the authority to fashion a program that is consistent with the legislative objectives. The authority of the agency to implement the program is usually contained in the same legislation. Here, the legislature proceeded along the same path, but it did so in two separate pieces of legislation rather than one. In 2011, the legislature delegated to the department the authority to: (1) develop a plan setting forth the essential elements of a program to convert energy users to natural gas; and (2) recommend legislative and administrative actions to implement the plan. See Public Acts 2011, No. 11-80, \u00a7 51; see also General Statutes \u00a7 16a-3d. The department developed a natural gas conversion plan with specific elements and recommendation for implementation. In 2013, the legislature approved the department's plan and the administrative steps proposed to implement it, and it delegated\n   to the department the authority to implement the plan as proposed. See Public Acts 2013, No. 13-298, \u00a7 51 (c); see also General Statutes \u00a7 16-19ww (d). Although the legislature proceeded in two steps rather than one, it nevertheless delegated to the department the authority to make discretionary determinations. Without these determinations, the program would neither have been developed\n   nor would it have been implemented. I disagree with the trial court's analysis because, in my view, the trial court focused on the acts of the legislature and not on the discretionary determinations and other implementation activities of the department. The conversions to natural gas that are at the heart of this case could not have been implemented without the department's actions. Therefore, I would conclude, unlike the trial court, that the department initiated the proposed plan and had wide discretion in both the acceptance and administration of the plan. Consequently, the actions of the department were far from ministerial and should have required the court to evaluate any potential impact on the environment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   The trial court classified the department's actions as ministerial acts of adherence to strict and narrowly tailored legislative commands. In my view, the record shows otherwise. The legislature had neither the technical expertise nor the inclination to make the types of determinations it delegated to the department. As is customary, it relied on the expertise of the administrative agencies to make the determinations necessary to implement a natural gas conversion program. The determinations of the department, acting through the authority, were essential prerequisites to implementation of the plan and, as such, they were acts of \"initiation\" within the meaning of \u00a7 22a-1b (c).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   The majority concludes that \"[i]n the present case, the defendants have not proposed to undertake or to fund the activities that the plaintiff alleges will have a major impact on the state's environmental resources, namely, the construction of new gas pipelines in the state resulting in the increased discharge of methane gas into the atmosphere. Rather, these activities will be undertaken and funded by the local distribution companies, which are private entities. Accordingly, we conclude that the trial court properly granted the\n   defendants' motions to dismiss on the ground that the requirement of an environmental impact evaluation in \u00a7 22a-1b (c) does not apply to their activities in the present case.\" I respectfully disagree. The difference in opinion is that the majority reads the statute to require that the state either undertake or fund the activities. I am not sure how the word undertake is different from the word funding because, in either event, the state is going to pay for the project. In my view, the statute requires an environmental impact evaluation where, as here, the state has made a proposal to a private entity or group of entities, and has used its discretion to determine how the ultimate project is to be constructed. Any other construction would render the term \"initiated\" in \u00a7 22a-1b (c) superfluous.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   In 2011, the legislature mandated that the department propose a comprehensive energy strategy for the state. See Public Acts 2011, No. 11-80, \u00a7 51 (a); see also General Statutes \u00a7 16a-3d. As part of that comprehensive energy strategy, the department proposed the elements and contours of a natural gas conversion plan, and it proposed a series of administrative actions that placed the department at the center of the implementation process.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   The department's proposal requested authority to review the plan from private\n   gas companies, to determine its consistency with the comprehensive energy strategy, to modify the plan it had received, and, through the authority, to make the changes to the regulatory structure necessary to ensure the plan's feasibility and, ultimately, to approve it. In short, the department proposed a sequence of activities leading to performance of the conversions by private gas companies. This sequence of activities was first proposed by the department. None of the activities were mandated, or even mentioned, by the legislature in 2011. See Public Acts 2011, No. 11-80, \u00a7 51. Had the department not fashioned\n   a natural gas conversion plan, and had the department not proposed the administrative steps to implement it, there would have been no plan for the legislature to approve or endorse. In 2013, the legislature gave the department discretion to review the plan it received from the gas companies in order to determine whether it was consistent with the comprehensive energy strategy. The department approved the plan only after the gas companies made numerous revisions that were directed by the department. Much of the gas companies' plan is the work of the department. If the department had not made the consistency determination, the plan would not have moved forward to final approval by the authority. Number 13-298, \u00a7 51 (c), of the 2013 Public Acts provides in relevant part that \"[i]n the event that the commissioner determines that the [gas companies'] plan is consistent with the [c]omprehensive [e]nergy [s]trategy ... the [authority] shall ... approve or modify the plan ....\" There would have been no plan to \"approve or modify\" had the department not made the threshold determination of consistency. Moreover, the legislative delegation to the authority to \"approve or modify\" the plan was extremely broad. The authority had almost unfettered discretion to condition its approval on modifications by the gas companies to their natural gas conversion plan. An agency's power to approve conditionally is inherent in the power to approve or disapprove.

This broad discretion provided the authority with the power to influence and shape the gas companies' plan and the activities necessary to implement it. Thereafter, the authority approved and modified the gas companies' plan. It also made a series of discretionary\n   determinations to change the rate structure in ways that were necessary to the plan's feasibility, including determinations to lower the hurdle rate for recoupment of costs by the gas companies. Had the authority not approved the gas companies' plan as modified, and had the authority not made these other determinations, the gas companies' conversion plan could never have been implemented. The authority's actions, as effectuated in twenty-two separate orders, were a major part of the implementation plan. Thus, the department proposed the primary recommendation for activities that may significantly affect the environment, making it the \"sponsoring agency\" for purposes of \u00a7 22a-1a-2 of the Regulations of Connecticut State Agencies. It also initiated the activities, after legislative approval, by making discretionary determinations that were essential to permitting the gas companies to carry out their plan. The department's actions, through the authority, were \"actions\" within the meaning of the policy act and its implementing regulations. In my view, the department's consistency determination is much the same as the determination made by the Department of Planning and Energy Policy in\n   <em>\n    Manchester Environmental Coalition\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Stockton\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"556223\" index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/184/51/#p63\">\n    184 Conn. at 54-55\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=441%20A.2d%2068\">\n    441 A.2d 68\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In that case, the Department of Planning and Energy Policy was required to determine that the project at issue \"is not inimical to any statewide program objectives.\" Id., at 55,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=441%20A.2d%2068\">\n    441 A.2d 68\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . That determination was a prerequisite to the approval of the project by the Commissioner of Commerce. Here, the department's consistency determination was a prerequisite for approval of the gas companies' plan by the authority. Therefore, I would conclude that the defendants' involvement in the gas project constituted \"action\" within the meaning of the policy act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   III\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   The complaint alleges that if the defendants had performed an environmental assessment, they would have\n   determined that the natural gas expansion plan will have a significant effect on the environment. The complaint also alleges that the plan, which proposes to convert 300,000 additional homes to natural gas and to build 900 miles of new gas lines, will significantly increase the amount of methane, a greenhouse gas, that is emitted each year by Connecticut's gas companies. Currently, it is alleged, the natural gas distribution system in Connecticut is leaking more than 200,000 metric tons of methane per year while serving 415,000 customers. Since the department's plan would almost double the number of gas customers, increased methane emissions, it is alleged, would result and their extent should have been assessed and, if necessary, moderated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   As alleged in the complaint, the impact of methane is considerably more serious than that of carbon dioxide. The United States Environmental Protection Agency has concluded that methane is more than twenty times as effective as carbon dioxide in trapping heat in the atmosphere. For this reason, Connecticut has established targets for decreased greenhouse gas emissions in the state's Global Warming Solutions Act. See Public Acts 2008, No. 08-98, \u00a7 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   The complaint also alleges that the department's plan to build 900 miles of new gas lines requires construction activities that will adversely impact the state's freshwater wetlands, soils, water, groundwater aquifers, trees and wildlife habitat. The complaint states that these consequences, like the increased methane emissions, should also have been assessed and, if necessary, moderated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   All of these activities were undertaken with no environmental impact evaluation. As a result of the majority decision today, the state will be able to avoid an environmental review of future projects by following the same process it followed in the present case. Such a result\n   is not contemplated by the policy act. The policy act was designed to ensure a thoughtful and meaningful consideration of environmental issues. The procedures mandated by the policy act should have been invoked in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   In my view, therefore, the decision of the trial court dismissing the complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction should be reversed. The matter should be remanded to the trial court with instructions consistent with a determination that the defendants proposed and initiated an \"action\" within the meaning of the policy act and for further proceedings to determine whether this \"action\" will arguably have a significant effect on the environment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Accordingly, I respectfully dissent.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-98\">\n    The majority maintains in footnote 13 of its opinion that \"[w]e do not believe that it was simply redundant for the legislature to make it clear that an environmental impact assessment is required\n    <em>\n     either\n    </em>\n    when a state actor undertakes the activity\n    <em>\n     or\n    </em>\n    when a private actor undertakes the activity, but the activity is funded by the state. In any event, it is far from clear that the state funds all activities by state actors, in whole or in part. We note, for example, that the federal government frequently funds state programs and projects, and, without having performed a comprehensive review of those activities, we are not prepared to say that the state contributes funding to all of them.\" (Emphasis in original.)\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-99\">\n    I continue to maintain, respectfully, that pursuant to \u00a7 22a-1a-1 (2) of the regulations, the word \"action\" includes \"other proposed activity for which an agency exercises judgment or discretion as to the propriety of that action.\" The definition does not state that ultimate action must be undertaken by an agency or agencies.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-100\">\n    The majority accurately highlights one of the problems in this case. The record is inadequate to determine the nature of the funding in this case. See footnote 13 of the majority opinion. Certainly, in the sense that the state is involved, the state funds payment for its employees reviewing the projects and any experts whom the state may consult. Although the record reflects the private funding of the project, we do not know if the state was being reimbursed for the costs in reviewing the project. This issue relates to the issues discussed in part I of this dissenting opinion. In my view, the matter should be returned for a factual hearing regarding the full nature of the funding in this matter. Otherwise, we are resorting to speculation regarding the true nature of this project and how facts that are developed at a hearing may relate to the appropriate interpretation of the statute.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
