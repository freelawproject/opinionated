In this appeal, the plaintiffs claim that the trial court improperly concluded that: (1) it lacked subject matter jurisdiction with respect to the plaintiffs' claim for a refund for the taxable year 2002 on the basis of the three year limitation period to file an income tax refund pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 12-732 (a) ; (2) \u00a7 12-711(b) -18 of the Regulations of Connecticut State Agencies permitted the defendant to tax the plaintiffs' income derived from the exercise of options because the options were granted as compensation for performing services within the state; and (3) it is constitutional to impose a tax on income derived from the\n   exercise of nonqualified stock options\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   by a nonresident who was granted the options as compensation for performing services within the state. We disagree with each of the plaintiffs claims. Because the form of the trial court's judgment with respect to the plaintiffs'\n   claim relating to the taxable year 2002 was improper, we reverse the trial court's award of summary judgment with respect to that taxable year and remand the case with direction to render judgment dismissing that claim. We affirm the judgment of the trial court in all other respects.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The following undisputed facts and procedural history are relevant to this appeal. From 1990 to 2001, Jefferson Allen\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   served as president and chief financial officer of Tosco, Inc. (Tosco). During this period, Allen was domiciled in and performed services solely within Connecticut. As part of his compensation while employed with Tosco, he was awarded nonqualified stock options.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   In 2002, while the plaintiffs were residing outside of Connecticut, Allen exercised the options he was granted by Tosco, resulting in $7,633,027 of income. The plaintiffs filed a Connecticut nonresident and part\n   year resident income tax return reporting income from exercising these options in 2002 and paid the applicable tax.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   After a period of nonresidency from 2002 to 2004, the plaintiffs returned to Connecticut in 2005. From January 1, 2005 to August 31, 2005, Allen served as the chief executive officer of Premcor, Inc. (Premcor), and performed services solely within Connecticut. As part of his compensation for performing services for Premcor, Allen was awarded nonqualified stock options.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   The plaintiffs again moved out of Connecticut and resided outside the state in 2006 and 2007. In 2006, Allen exercised certain stock options he had earned performing services for Premcor, resulting in $43,360,812 of income. In 2007, Allen again exercised certain stock options that were earned as compensation for performing services for Premcor, resulting in $2,247,745 of income. The plaintiffs timely filed their tax returns and paid the applicable tax for the taxable years 2007 and 2008.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In October, 2009, the plaintiffs filed amended returns for the taxable years 2002, 2006, and 2007, claiming refunds for the income tax that the plaintiffs had paid in each of those years. The plaintiffs' claims for a refund were denied. In 2013, the Appellate Division of the Department of Revenue Services affirmed the denial. The defendant thereafter issued a final determination denying the plaintiffs' claims for refunds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 12-730,\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   the plaintiffs timely filed an appeal from the defendant's determination in the Superior Court. The parties filed cross\n   motions for summary judgment on stipulated facts, which the trial court granted in favor of the defendant. This appeal followed.\n   Additional facts and procedural history will be set forth as necessary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   First we address the issue of whether the trial court properly concluded that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction regarding the plaintiffs' claim for a refund for the taxable year 2002 because they filed their claim after the lapse of the three year statute of limitations for such a claim pursuant to \u00a7 12-732 (a) (1). The plaintiffs concede that their request for a refund was filed after the lapse of the three year period.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Nevertheless, relying principally upon\n   <em>\n    Williams\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Commission on Human Rights &amp; Opportunities\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"963525\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/257/258/\">\n    257 Conn. 258\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=777%20A.2d%20645\">\n    777 A.2d 645\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2001), the plaintiffs argue that the three year statute of limitations is not jurisdictional and, therefore, should be equitably tolled. In response, the defendant claims that the statute of limitations, because it forms part of a statutory scheme that waives sovereign immunity, is jurisdictional and should not be tolled. We agree with the defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The following additional facts and procedural history are relevant to the resolution of this issue. The defendant commenced an audit of the plaintiffs' taxable year 2005 income tax return in July 2006. In March 2007, the defendant expanded the audit to include the taxable\n   years 2001 through 2004. Around this same time, the plaintiffs filed a Connecticut nonresident and part year resident return reporting income from 2002 and paid the applicable tax. In October 2009, the plaintiffs filed amended returns for the taxable year 2002, claiming a refund for the income tax that the plaintiffs had paid. In October, 2012, the plaintiffs claim for a refund for the taxable year 2002 was disallowed. The defendant denied the request for a refund on the grounds that, pursuant to \u00a7 12-732 (a) (1),\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   the claim for a refund was untimely. The trial court affirmed the determination of the defendant, concluding that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction to consider the plaintiffs' claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Our standard of review with respect to a trial court determination regarding subject matter jurisdiction is well settled. \"A determination regarding a trial court's subject matter jurisdiction is a question of law.

The plaintiffs claim that the income derived from the exercise of the Premcor options by Allen in 2006 and 2007 is not properly taxable under \u00a7 12-711(b)-18 (a) of the regulations. Specifically, the plaintiffs claim that \u00a7 12-711(b) -18 (a) requires a taxpayer to be performing services in Connecticut at the time of exercising the options, as well as at the time the options were awarded, in order for the income derived therefrom to be subject to taxation. The defendant contends that \u00a7 12-711(b) -18 (a) requires only that the taxpayer have been performing services in Connecticut at the time the options were granted. The plaintiffs further claim that taxation of the income derived from the exercise of the Premcor options violates the due process clause of the federal constitution. We disagree with the plaintiffs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The following additional facts and procedural history are relevant to the resolution of these issues. In October 2009, the plaintiffs filed amended returns for the taxable years 2006 and 2007, claiming refunds\n   for the income tax that the plaintiffs had paid for both of those years. The defendant denied the plaintiffs' claims for a refund for taxable years 2006 and 2007 on the grounds that the Premcor options were granted as compensation for services Allen performed in Connecticut and, therefore, the income was properly reported as income from Connecticut sources. In 2013, the Appellate Division of the Department of Revenue Services affirmed the denial. The defendant thereafter issued a final determination denying the plaintiffs' claims for refunds. The plaintiffs timely appealed to the trial court, which affirmed the decision of the defendant and rejected the plaintiffs' constitutional claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   A\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Our resolution of this issue first requires a discussion of the legal framework applicable to the state and federal taxation of nonqualified stock options.

Pursuant to this statutory authority, the defendant has promulgated a regulation that addresses nonqualified stock options that provides in relevant part as follows: \"Connecticut adjusted gross income derived from or connected with sources within this state includes ... income recognized under section 83 of the Internal Revenue Code in connection with a nonqualified stock option if, during the period beginning with the first day of the taxable year of the optionee during which such option was granted and ending with the last day of the taxable year of the optionee during which such option was exercised (or, if the option has a readily ascertainable fair market value, as defined in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=26%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201.83-7\">\n    26 C.F.R. \u00a7 1.83-7\n   </extracted-citation>\n   [b], at the time of grant, the taxable year during which such option was granted), the optionee was performing services within Connecticut ....\" Regs., Conn.

The plaintiffs claim that ambiguity lies in the meaning of the word \"during,\" as used in \u00a7 12-711(b)-18 (a) of the regulations. Because that term is not defined by regulation or statute, we look to the dictionary for guidance. General Statutes \u00a7 1-1 (a). \"[D]uring\" is defined as both \"throughout the continuance or course of\" and \"at some point in the course of ....\" Webster's Third New International Dictionary (1961). By applying the first definition, \u00a7 12-711(b)-18 (a) of the regulations would subject option income to taxation only if the taxpayer had been performing services in the state throughout the period in which the options were granted and subsequently exercised. By applying the second definition, \u00a7 12-711(b)-18 (a) of the regulations would require that the nonresident taxpayer only have been performing services in the state at the time the options were awarded.

This subsection contains proviso language, \"to the extent provided in this section,\" which indicates that other parts of the regulation further delineate how much of the income is includable in Connecticut adjusted gross income. Subsection (b) of \u00a7 12-711(b)-18 requires the application of a formula to determine how much income is includable in Connecticut gross income for nonresident taxpayers who perform services wholly within Connecticut. Subsection (c) of \u00a7 12-711(b)-18 requires the application of a different formula to determine how much income is includable in Connecticut gross income for nonresident taxpayers who perform services partly within and partly without the state of Connecticut.\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n   If subsection (a) were construed to require the taxpayer to be performing services within Connecticut throughout the course of the relevant time period, then the option income of a taxpayer who performs services partially within and partially without Connecticut would, by definition, not be includable in Connecticut adjusted income. Consequently, the\n   formula set forth in subsection (c) to be applied to such a taxpayer would be superfluous because such taxpayer's option income would not be includable in gross income pursuant to subsection (a). Likewise, under the plaintiffs' construction, there would be no need to distinguish between taxpayers performing services wholly in Connecticut and taxpayers performing services partially within and partially without Connecticut because the option income of the latter would not be includable in Connecticut adjusted gross income pursuant to subsection (a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Second, the plaintiffs' proposed construction of the relevant regulation would lead to bizarre results. It is well established that \"those who promulgate statutes ... do not intend ... absurd consequences or bizarre results.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Courchesne\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4086520\" index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/296/622/#p710\">\n    296 Conn. 622\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 710,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=998%20A.2d%201\">\n    998 A.2d 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2010). According to the plaintiffs' proposed construction, option income is includable in Connecticut adjusted gross income only if the optionee was performing services within Connecticut throughout the course of \"the period beginning with the first day of the taxable year of the optionee during which such option was granted and ending with the last day of the taxable year of the optionee during which such option was exercised ....\" Regs., Conn. State Agencies \u00a7 12-711(b)-18 (a). The practical consequence of this construction is that a taxpayer may commence performing services after the first day of the taxable year in which the options are granted or cease performing services before the last day of the taxable year in which the options are exercised in order to escape taxation of the option income. By way of example, if a taxpayer commences performing services in Connecticut on February 1, is awarded options on June 30, exercises the options on March 1 of the following year, and continues employment thereafter, the income would not be\n   includable in Connecticut adjusted gross income because the taxpayer was not performing services in Connecticut during January, the first month of the taxable year in which the options were granted. Other similar examples could be envisaged. In addition, this construction is without a limiting principle. A taxpayer who takes one month of leave could claim that he was not performing services \"throughout the continuance or course of\" the relevant period. Perhaps a similar claim could be made for a week of leave, or even a day. This construction of the regulation is unreasonable and does not give effect to the intention of the defendant in promulgating the regulation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Application of the second definition of \"during,\" i.e., \"at some point in the course of,\" furnishes a reasonable construction of the regulatory language at issue. Under this construction, if at any point during the taxable year in which the options were granted and the taxable year in which the options were exercised the taxpayer were performing services in Connecticut, the income derived from the exercise of the options would be includable in Connecticut adjusted gross income. In turn, subsections (b) and (c) of \u00a7 12-711(b)-18 of the regulations set forth the extent to which the income is includable in Connecticut adjusted gross income on the basis of whether the services were performed wholly or partially within Connecticut. This construction imposes no irrational or arbitrary conditions upon the taxation of option income and comports comfortably with the due process principle that a state may tax the compensation of nonresidents who perform services within the taxing state. See part II C of this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   The plaintiffs' claim that the defendant's construction of the regulation would result in absurd results because a nonresident would be taxed upon the exercise of stock options but \"income distributed from a pension or retirement plan to nonresidents\" would not be subject\n   to taxation. Regs., Conn. State Agencies \u00a7 12-711(b)-12. This is absurd, the plaintiffs claim, because while both forms of income are earned while performing services in the state, only the former is subject to taxation.

The plaintiffs claim that taxation of income derived from the exercise of stock options by a nonresident violates the due process clause because the options had no readily ascertainable value when they were granted and there was an insufficient nexus between Connecticut and the value attributable to the options at the time of exercise. The defendant claims that the fact that Allen was granted the stock options as compensation for performing services in Connecticut serves as a sufficient nexus to the state to satisfy the requirements of the due process clause. We agree with the defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   In this appeal challenging the constitutionality of a regulation, we apply the same standard of review for challenges to the constitutionality of a statute. \"Determining the constitutionality of a statute presents a question of law over which our review is plenary ....

This principle does not stretch so far as to require that the benefits afforded by the state \"must generally span ... and not solely antedate\"\n   <em>\n    realization\n   </em>\n   of the income as the plaintiffs suggest; rather, it demands that enjoyment of the benefits provided by the state be contemporaneous with\n   <em>\n    earning\n   </em>\n   the income. Thus, the intervening passage of time\n   between Allen's cessation of employment in the state and the exercise of the stock options he earned performing services in the state does not deprive the state of jurisdiction to tax the income derived from the exercise of the stock options.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   The plaintiffs further contend that the income realized from the exercise of the stock options is not a result of the performance of services in Connecticut; but rather that the income is a result of the appreciation in value of the underlying stock, which is not connected to Allen's performance of services within the state. We disagree with this characterization of the income derived from the exercise of stock options.\n   <footnotemark>\n    26\n   </footnotemark>\n   The plaintiffs rightly point out that the stock options had no reasonably ascertainable fair market value at the time the options were awarded and, consequently, were not subject to taxation at the time they were granted.

Stock options do, however, have value at the time of award. Nonqualified stock options would not be contemplated as a form of compensation if they did not constitute value to the parties of an employment contract. The difficulty lies in quantifying the value of the stock options.\n   <footnotemark>\n    27\n   </footnotemark>\n   By implementing the applicable regulations, both the United States Internal\n   Revenue Service and the defendant determined that, rather than taxing the speculative value of the options at the time of award, the better course of action is to calculate the taxable income on the basis of the \"bargain element\" at the time of exercise. See\n   <em>\n    Rice\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Montgomery\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1778570\" index=\"154\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-app-3d/104/776/#p782\">\n    104 Ohio App.3d at 781\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"155\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=663%20N.E.2d%20389\">\n    663 N.E.2d 389\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[Federal law] resolves the difficulty of valuing a nontransferable stock option by waiting until the option is exercised, at which time there is a recognition of income\n   equal to the difference between the option price and the fair market value of the stock at the time of the exercise.

For compensation in the form of stock options, the intended compensation for services performed within the state is measured and taxed at the time the options are exercised.
