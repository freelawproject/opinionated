The state appeals\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   from the judgment of the trial court, which suppressed\n   evidence seized from the condominium of the defendant, Dennis Kono, following such a canine sniff. The trial court concluded that the canine sniff constituted a search within the meaning of the fourth amendment to the United States constitution and, therefore, required a warrant predicated on probable cause. We conclude that the canine sniff violated article first, \u00a7 7, and, accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the trial court.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   THE FACTS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The record reveals the following undisputed facts. In May, 2012, the Berlin Police Department received an anonymous tip that the defendant was boasting about growing marijuana at a condominium complex on Main Street in the town of Berlin. The case was assigned to Detective Shaun Solek, who determined that the condominium complex in question was a former factory located at 10 Main Street. Solek also discovered that the defendant lived in unit 204. Because the complex was still under construction, Solek contacted the developer, Corporation for Independent Living (developer), to request permission to enter the building. The developer referred Solek to the property manager, Connecticut Real Estate Management, whose owner, Alyssa Pillion, signed a consent form allowing Solek and Officer Eric Chase, a canine handler with the Berlin Police Department, to conduct a canine examination of the common areas of the building.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On the afternoon of May 29, 2012, Solek and Chase went to the condominium complex and were admitted into the building by Stephen Martino, the developer's property manager. As the trial court found, \"[t]he first two floors contained thirty-four residential units, only a portion of which [was] completed and occupied. The outside doors to the multiunit building are normally\n   locked, and access is gained through a keypad. Chase, who is a trained canine handler, was accompanied by his German Shepherd dog, Zeusz. Zeusz had been trained to detect eight substances including marijuana, hash [ish], crack cocaine, cocaine, ecstasy, and methamphetamine. Prior to the search of the complex, Chase was not informed ... which condominium unit was under investigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \"Chase first had Zeusz conduct a presearch of the first floor common hallway. During the presearch, Zeusz is allowed to walk throughout the hallway without direction from his handler. After the presearch, Chase conducted a directed search in which Zeusz was commanded to sniff at the bottom of the front door of each condominium [unit] on the first floor. The same presearch and directed search procedures were also conducted on the second floor. When Zeusz performed his sniff at the bottom of the door to unit 204, the dog sat\n   down in front of the door, which constituted a passive alert that [Zeusz] had detected contraband. Chase directed Zeusz to perform a second directed search on the second floor and Zeusz again gave a passive alert for drugs at unit 204. Chase knocked on the door but received no response. Chase remained at the door to [e]nsure that no one entered the premises, and Solek left to prepare a search warrant for [the] unit .... Approximately four hours later, Solek returned with a signed search warrant. Upon executing the warrant, the police discovered an indoor greenhouse containing marijuana plants, as well as seeds, lighting equipment and various firearms.\" The defendant was arrested and charged with several drug offenses and illegal possession of an assault weapon.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   THE TRIAL COURT'S DECISION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The defendant subsequently filed a motion to suppress the evidence seized from his condominium on\n   the ground that a canine sniff of the threshold of his home, for the purpose of investigating the home's contents, constituted a search under both the fourth amendment and article first, \u00a7 7, of the state constitution. Specifically, the defendant argued that his front door and the hallway adjacent thereto were within the constitutionally protected curtilage of his condominium unit such that the entry of a dog into that area for the purpose of conducting a drug sniff constituted a trespass. The defendant further argued that a sniff by a well trained narcotics dog for the purpose of detecting drugs inside his home violated his reasonable expectation of privacy under\n   <em>\n    Katz\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    United States\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11339173\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/389/347/\">\n    389 U.S. 347\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11339173\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/389/347/\">\n    88 S.Ct. 507\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11339173\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/389/347/\">\n    19 L.Ed.2d 576\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1967).

The trial court agreed that the canine sniff violated the defendant's reasonable expectation of privacy under the fourth amendment and granted the defendant's motion to suppress. In light of its determination that the police had violated the federal constitution, the court did not reach the defendant's claim under the state constitution.

In the trial court's view, it was immaterial that the police were lawfully present in the hallway, or that the defendant had a diminished expectation of privacy in the common areas of his condominium complex, because the privacy interest at stake did not relate to those areas but, rather, to the inside of the defendant's home. The trial court also expressed concern that allowing the police to conduct warrantless canine sniffs of the front doors of apartments and condominium units but not of single-family homes-the practice found to violate the fourth amendment in\n   <em>\n    Jardines\n   </em>\n   -would impermissibly apportion constitutional rights on the basis of economic class.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Specifically, the trial court stated: \"The use of a drug detection dog situated in a common hallway outside the front door to a condominium [unit] is no less an intrusion into the privacy of one's home than the [use of a] drug detection dog ... on the front porch of the single-family residence in\n   <em>\n    Jardines\n   </em>\n   . To rule otherwise would afford residents of this state who reside in multifamily apartments less a measure of privacy protected by the fourth amendment than their more well-off neighbors.\" The trial court stated further: \"It would also allow law enforcement to troll through the hallways of apartment buildings, including public housing projects, with drug sniffing dogs to search for contraband within individual apartments .... Such arbitrary and unfettered\n   discretion is assuredly repugnant to the fourth amendment.\" (Citation omitted.) Thereafter, the trial court granted the defendant's motion to dismiss the charges against him on the ground that none of the state's evidence would be admissible at a trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   III\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   ANALYSIS UNDER ARTICLE FIRST, \u00a7 7, OF THE CONNECTICUT CONSTITUTION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On appeal, the state reasserts its contention that the canine sniff of the defendant's front door and the hallway adjacent thereto was not a search under article first, \u00a7 7, because the defendant had no reasonable expectation of privacy in the area searched or in the contraband inside his home.

For example, as the court in\n   <em>\n    Anthony\n   </em>\n   explained: \"The legal premise that governmental conduct that only reveals the possession of contraband compromises no legitimate privacy interest ... is not, on its face, a [fact specific] judgment with respect to cars or luggage-or really even a judgment about privacy expectations; it is a judgment about the legitimacy of hiding contraband. From this perspective, there is no reason why governmental conduct that only reveals the possession of contraband in a house should be different from governmental conduct that only reveals the possession of contraband in the trunk of a car, because the reason for not affording contraband [f]ourth [a]mendment privacy protection has nothing to do with expectations of what will remain private, and everything to do with what society is prepared to accept as legitimate privacy.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    United States\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Anthony\n   </em>\n   , supra. Consistent with this reasoning, the court concluded that a canine sniff of an apartment from the hallway of a multifamily residence, at least when \"nothing in the record calls into question the factual premise that nothing is revealed other than possession of contraband by a dog sniff,\" is not a search under the fourth amendment. Id. ; see also\n   <em>\n    United States\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Broadway\n   </em>\n   , supra, at 1191 (\"as long as the canine unit is lawfully\n   present when the sniff occurs, the canine sniff is not a search within the meaning of the [f]ourth [a]mendment\" [internal quotation marks omitted] ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   We acknowledge that, in\n   <em>\n    Place\n   </em>\n   and, more recently, in\n   <em>\n    Caballes\n   </em>\n   , the United States Supreme Court employed reasoning that supports the conclusion that a canine sniff is not a search under the fourth amendment because that investigative technique reveals only the\n   existence of contraband, and one's subjective expectation of privacy in contraband is not objectively reasonable.

Indeed, as the Seventh Circuit observed in\n   <em>\n    Whitaker\n   </em>\n   , allowing police dogs to sniff the doors of apartments but not freestanding homes would be deeply \"troubling because it would apportion [constitutional] protections on grounds that correlate with income, race, and ethnicity.

For households solely composed of blacks, that number dropped to 47.2 [percent]. And for Hispanic households, that number was 52.1 [percent]. The percentage of households that live in [single unit], detached houses consistently rises with income. At the low end, 40.9 [percent] of households that earned less than $10,000 lived in [single unit], detached houses, and, at the high end, 84 [percent] of households that earned more than $120,000 did so.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   <em>\n    United States\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Whitaker\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4255284,4255788\" index=\"252\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/820/849/\">\n    820 F.3d at 854\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . For this important reason, we believe that public policy strongly favors the state constitutional interpretation advocated by the defendant in the present case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Accordingly, we are unable to agree with the state that all canine sniffs are constitutionally innocuous. Rather, for the reasons previously discussed in this opinion, we conclude that a canine sniff directed toward a home-whether freestanding or part of a multitenant structure-is a search under article first, \u00a7 7, and, as such, requires a warrant issued upon a court's finding of probable cause.\n   <footnotemark>\n    21\n   </footnotemark>\n   We\n   therefore conclude that the defendant was entitled to the suppression of the evidence seized from his residence as the fruit of the unlawful canine sniff.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   IV\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   RESPONSE TO THE CONCURRING JUSTICE\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   In his concurring opinion, Justice Zarella contends that we should have decided this case under the federal constitution rather than under the state constitution. In support of this contention, he states that, as a general matter, \"the proper mode of analysis [in a case involving claims under both the federal and state constitutions] should be to address the federal claim first, turning to the state constitutional claim only after determining that the federal constitution does not provide a basis for relief or if the applicable federal rule is truly unsettled.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Because Justice Zarella concludes that the defendant in the present case prevails under settled fourth amendment principles, he asserts that we have no cause to consider the defendant's state constitutional claim.

Three members of the court-Justices Ginsburg, Sotomayor and Kagan-take a contrary view. Justice Thomas, the remaining member of the court who also participated in\n   <em>\n    Jardines\n   </em>\n   , took no position on whether the canine sniff violated Jardines' reasonable expectation of privacy. Thus, four current members of the court would decide the present case\n   <em>\n    against\n   </em>\n   the defendant on federal constitutional grounds, three current members of the court would decide the present case\n   <em>\n    in favor\n   </em>\n   of the defendant on federal constitutional grounds, and one current member of the court has taken no express position on the issue. Even if we were to assume that Justice Thomas' decision not to join Justice Kagan's concurrence reveals nothing about his view on the matter, more current members of the court are on record as concluding that a canine sniff at the front door of a home is\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   a search and, consequently, does not violate the fourth amendment. Accordingly, we reject Justice Zarella's assertion that the defendant clearly prevails under the federal constitution because, in fact, we simply have no idea how a majority of the members of the United States Supreme Court would decide the issue. Although we believe that the more persuasive lower court precedent weighs in favor of our conclusion in this case, it can hardly be said that the issue is a settled one.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   The judgment is affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   In this opinion ROGERS, C.J., and McDONALD, ROBINSON and VERTEFEUILLE, Js., concurred.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   ZARELLA, J., concurring in the judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   I agree that the use of a dog sniff to detect contraband inside the condominium unit occupied by the defendant, Dennis Kono, violated his rights, but for reasons different from those given by the majority.

Instead, when a party raises a claim under both the federal and state constitutions, the proper mode of analysis should be to address the federal claim first, turning to the state constitutional claim only after determining that the federal constitution does not provide a basis for relief or if the applicable federal rule is truly unsettled. I therefore respectfully concur only in the judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Turning to the federal constitutional question, I would first conclude that federal case law from the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit resolves the federal constitutional claim before us.

To be sure, Justice Espinosa has raised significant distinctions between the issues decided by the United States Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    Kyllo\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Jardines\n   </em>\n   , and the precise issue raised in the present case.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   But, in my view, these distinctions do not justify a departure from Second Circuit precedent, at least if we are applying federal law.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   I thus would begin with the federal constitutional analysis, apply the Second Circuit's decision in\n   <em>\n    Thomas\n   </em>\n   ,\n   and conclude that the dog sniff of the defendant's condominium unit in the present case was a search under the fourth amendment. Deciding otherwise would have the bizarre consequence of granting our citizens\n   <em>\n    less\n   </em>\n   protection under federal law in state courts than that provided under federal law in federal courts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Because we may resolve the present case in the defendant's favor under the federal constitution, I disagree with the majority's decision to sidestep the federal constitution and instead resolve this issue by creating new doctrine under the state constitution. Specifically, I disagree with the majority's assertion, which is made without citation to authority, that we should analyze a federal constitutional claim first only if we are \"able to say with a high degree of confidence that the United States Supreme Court, if presented with the federal constitutional claim,\" would reach the same conclusion. Footnote 23 of the majority opinion. The ability to confidently forecast how the United States Supreme Court might decide a question has not, in prior decisions, been treated as a prerequisite to beginning with a federal constitutional analysis. See generally, e.g.,\n   <em>\n    Pham\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Starkowski\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6775561\" index=\"306\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/300/412/#p428\">\n    300 Conn. 412\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 428-62,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"307\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=16%20A.3d%20635\">\n    16 A.3d 635\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2011) ;\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Jenkins\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4344796\" index=\"308\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/298/209/#p231\">\n    298 Conn. 209\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 231-48,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"309\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=3%20A.3d%20806\">\n    3 A.3d 806\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2010). Indeed, we routinely decide federal constitutional questions without clear guidance from the United States Supreme Court when those federal claims are made without accompanying state constitutional claims. Consequently, in light of the Second Circuit's prior decision in\n   <em>\n    Thomas\n   </em>\n   , I do not view the relevant federal precedent to be so ambiguous as to require that we avoid a federal analysis in the first instance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   To be sure, if the federal rule were truly unsettled-perhaps if\n   <em>\n    neither\n   </em>\n   the United States Supreme Court\n   <em>\n    nor\n   </em>\n   the Second Circuit had addressed the question, and\n   other federal courts were generally silent on the matter-I might agree with the majority's approach. In the present case, however, the Second Circuit has already spoken on the question before us, on at least two occasions, so its decision is already binding on federal law enforcement personnel and the federal district courts\n   <em>\n    in this state\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   In addition, resolving the case under the federal constitution is more consistent with the procedural history of this case. Throughout the proceedings, the parties have principally argued the case under the federal constitution. In the trial court, the defendant moved to suppress the evidence at issue first under the federal constitution and only added a claim under the state constitution as an alternative. The trial court decided the motion to suppress in the defendant's favor under the federal constitution and therefore found it unnecessary to address the claim under the state constitution, leaving us without any lower court ruling on the state constitution to consider. And, because the trial court based its decision on the federal constitution\n   alone, the parties in their appeal to this court again focused their arguments on the federal constitution, presenting the state constitutional claim as an alternative ground for affirmance. Reaching the state constitutional issue in the present appeal is unnecessary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   Perhaps the majority is concerned that the United States Supreme Court might disagree with its conclusion, and thus wants to insulate our decision from further review and possible reversal. This reasoning has its proponents; see, e.g., W. Horton, The Connecticut State Constitution (2d Ed. 2012) p. 36; but it seems to me to be an insufficient reason to avoid applying the federal constitution when it is otherwise dispositive. If the United States Supreme Court ever does overrule\n   <em>\n    Thomas\n   </em>\n   , in either this case or another case, we could revisit the question under our state constitution\n   <em>\n    then\n   </em>\n   ,\n   when there is actually a principled need for doing so, and with the added benefit of being able to consider the United States Supreme Court's rationale as we consider the parameters of our own constitution. Indeed, if the United States Supreme Court were to disagree with\n   <em>\n    Thomas\n   </em>\n   , the validity of the majority's state constitutional analysis will necessarily be called into question in any event, given that we consider federal law when interpreting our state constitution and our understanding of federal law would have been incorrect.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Geisler\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"546505\" index=\"310\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/222/672/#p685\">\n    222 Conn. 672\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 685,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"311\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=610%20A.2d%201225\">\n    610 A.2d 1225\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1992) (federal precedent is used as persuasive tool when court construes state constitution); see also\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Skok\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"312\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=318%20Conn.%20699\">\n    318 Conn. 699\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 730-31,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"313\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=122%20A.3d%20608\">\n    122 A.3d 608\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2015) (\n   <em>\n    Zarella\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    J.\n   </em>\n   , concurring) (agreeing that federal precedent provides persuasive authority when court interprets provisions of state constitution, at least when such provisions are related to federal constitutional provisions).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   III\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   The majority's decision to look first to the state constitution-a view grounded, in my view, on a faulty premise-highlights an inconsistency in our case law about whether we should first look to the federal or the state constitution when claims under both are properly raised.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   Our prior cases, including many search and seizure cases, do not reflect a principled approach to this question. For example, this court has, on a few occasions, relied solely on the state constitution without any explanation of why it did not conduct any analysis under the federal constitution. See, e.g.,\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Joyce\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"760046\" index=\"314\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/229/10/#p24\">\n    229 Conn. 10\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 15,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"315\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=639%20A.2d%201007\">\n    639 A.2d 1007\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1994) (declining to reach federal constitutional claim because state constitution provided basis for relief).

I would take this opportunity to clarify our mode of analysis with respect to the order of our consideration of federal and state constitutional issues. In my view, when a party properly raises a claim under both a federal constitutional provision and a comparable state constitutional provision, the better practice is to first address the question under the federal constitution, turning to the state constitution only after concluding that the federal provision does not provide a basis for relief or if the interpretation of the federal provision is truly unsettled or ambiguous. Ultimately, the quality of our constitutional analysis is most critical in a given case, but there are several prudential reasons to prefer consideration of the federal constitution first.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   A\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   For one thing, looking to the federal constitution first is more consistent with the reality of existing legal doctrine concerning individual rights and with our understanding of the role of our state constitution, which recognizes that the federal constitution sets a national minimum for the protection of individual rights but leaves states to interpret their constitutions to provide greater protection.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   Some commentators and courts recommend looking to the state constitution first when confronted with a claim under both the federal and state constitution-an approach commonly referred to as the primacy model. Under this approach, the state court looks first to its own state constitution, looking to the federal constitution only if the state constitution fails to provide a basis for relief. See, e.g., W. Horton, supra, p. 37; J. Landau, \" Some Thoughts About 'State Constitutional Interpretation,\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"331\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=115%20Penn%20St.%20L.%20Rev.%20837\">\n    115 Penn.

Linde, \"First Things First: Rediscovering the States' Bill of Rights,\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"332\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=9%20U.%20Balt.%20L.%20Rev.%20379\">\n    9 U. Balt. L. Rev. 379\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 387 (1980). Proponents argue that, in a federal system, the first referent of a state judge should be the state's own laws and constitution, not the laws of another government. See W. Horton, supra, p. 37.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   But this approach is inconsistent with the plain reality that federal constitutional law now dominates the field of individual\n   constitutional rights, even in state proceedings, at least since the United States Supreme Court had determined that most of the guarantees in the federal Bill of Rights apply to the states by virtue of the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment-a process often referred to as incorporation. See U.S. Const., amend. XIV, \u00a7 1 (prohibiting state governments from depriving \"any person of life, liberty or property, without due process of law\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   Before incorporation, state courts had no need to look beyond their state constitution or to consider which constitution to apply in a given case, because the federal constitution did not apply to state proceedings. State and federal courts treated the federal constitution as applying only to the federal government, with limited exceptions for when the federal constitution explicitly restricted actions by a state government, such as the prohibition on passing an ex post facto law. U.S. Const., Art. I, \u00a7 10, cl. 1. Thus, in\n   <em>\n    Barron\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Mayor &amp; City Council\n   </em>\n   , 32 U.S. (7 Pet.) 243, 250,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1436167\" index=\"333\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/32/243/\">\n    8 L.Ed. 672\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1833), the court rejected a claim that the fifth amendment's takings clause applied to state legislation. Writing for the court, Chief Justice John Marshall explained: \"The [federal] constitution was ordained and established by the people of the United States for themselves, for their own government, and not for the government of the individual states. Each state established a constitution for itself, and, in that constitution, provided such limitations and restrictions on the powers of its particular government as its judgment dictated.\" Id., at 247. Because\n   the amendments in the Bill of Rights \"contain no expression indicating an intention to apply them to the state governments,\" the court concluded that it could not \"so apply them.\" Id., at 250.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   Under this view, courts accepted that rights granted by states might vary from those granted under the federal constitution. As the court explained in\n   <em>\n    United States\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Cruikshank\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8758\" index=\"334\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/92/542/\">\n    92 U.S. 542\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8758\" index=\"335\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/92/542/\">\n    23 L.Ed. 588\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1875), \"[w]e have in our political system a government of the United States and a government of each of the several [s]tates.

This curtailment led commentators and dissenting United States Supreme Court justices in the 1970s and 1980s to encourage state courts to reject that court's recent curtailments by finding greater protection for individual rights under state constitutions.

In most cases, the federal rule will be readily ascertainable. Because litigants have strongly favored federal claims, courts across the country apply the federal constitution and do so more often than we apply our\n   own state constitution. This has created an \"expansive body of federal law\" far more developed than state constitutional law on an overlapping topic. \"Developments in the Law: The Interpretation of State Constitutional Rights,\" supra,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"429\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=95%20Harv.%20L.%20Rev.%201357\">\n    95 Harv. L. Rev. 1357\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (state constitutions are better served when performing gap filling role in light of extensive number of federal decisions already covering much of field).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   Starting with the federal constitution better allows us to articulate differences between the federal and state constitutions when they exist. When the state constitution provides protection not afforded by the federal constitution, certainly, we have a duty to enforce the state constitution. See, e.g.,\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Dukes\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"561267\" index=\"430\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/209/98/#p112\">\n    209 Conn. 98\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 112,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"431\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=547%20A.2d%2010\">\n    547 A.2d 10\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1988). But deciding a claim under the state constitution without first articulating the result under the federal constitution can leave ambiguity about whether and to what extent our constitution actually differs from the federal constitution. One commentator has explained that, \"[w]hen state judges pass over a fairly arguable federal issue ... we do not know whether the decision upholding the claim of state constitutional rights is a genuinely differentiated act of state\n   interpretation or a crypto-federal ruling.\" M. Kelman, supra,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"432\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=27%20Wayne%20L.%20Rev.%20430\">\n    27 Wayne L. Rev. 430\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Instead, the better practice is to declare the scope of the federal constitution before embarking on a state constitutional analysis. Doing so clearly delineates the differences between the two constitutions. Indeed, \"[b]y proceeding from a failed federal claim to the question [of] whether the state constitution grants broader rights in the circumstances of the case, the state court eliminates an ambiguity that otherwise might shroud its decision. It tells us distinctly, and obliges the court to think more carefully about, whether and why the state constitution differs from or retains the same meaning as the federally interpreted counterpart.\" Id., 429. It also helps to avoid the appearance that the\n   state constitutional analysis is merely a result oriented rejection of the federal rule rather than truly an independent and principled interpretation of our state charter. See id., 430-31 (\"[t]he more credible separation of the state from the federal interpretation is that which takes place in the first place by a clear cut disposition of the [federal] issue followed by the state constitutional pronouncement\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   Moreover, analyzing a claim first under the federal constitution coincides with our mode of state constitutional interpretation, which requires us to consider federal law on the topic in any event. Federal constitutional jurisprudence, although not binding, provides persuasive authority for any interpretation or application of an analogous provision of our state constitution. See, e.g.,\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Linares\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"765884\" index=\"433\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/232/345/#p354\">\n    232 Conn. at 378-79\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"434\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=655%20A.2d%20737\">\n    655 A.2d 737\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Indeed, we use federal precedent as one of six interpretive tools when construing our constitution, at least when our state constitution has a federal analog. See, e.g.,\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Geisler\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"546505\" index=\"435\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/222/672/#p685\">\n    222 Conn. at 685\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"436\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=610%20A.2d%201225\">\n    610 A.2d 1225\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; see also\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Skok\n   </em>\n   , supra, 318 Conn. at 729-31,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"437\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=122%20A.3d%20608\">\n    122 A.3d 608\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Zarella\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    J.\n   </em>\n   , concurring). If, after reviewing federal case law in the context of a state constitutional analysis, it becomes apparent that the federal constitution would provide relief, there is no practical need for continuing with a needless state constitutional disquisition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   Beginning with the federal constitution also helps to avoid unnecessary constitutional decision making. If the federal constitution provides relief in a given case, we have no need to consider the question separately under the state constitution. As a matter of judicial restraint, we commonly avoid addressing constitutional questions that are not necessary to our disposition. See, e.g.,\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Cofield\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"545036\" index=\"438\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/220/38/#p49\">\n    220 Conn. 38\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 49-50,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"439\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=595%20A.2d%201349\">\n    595 A.2d 1349\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1991) (declining to consider whether recent United States Supreme Court decision also applied under state constitution when existing federal constitutional law\n   was dispositive). If the federal constitution affords relief, we should not conduct an unnecessary state constitutional analysis, especially when, as in the present case, doing so requires us to needlessly create new doctrine. See \"Developments in the Law: The Interpretation of State Constitutional Rights,\" supra,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"440\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=95%20Harv.%20L.%20Rev.%201357\">\n    95 Harv.

Divergent search and seizure principles encourage the criminal law equivalent of forum shopping, at least for crimes that might also be prosecuted under federal law.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Because our state constitution does\n   not bind federal authorities or federal courts; see, e.g.,\n   <em>\n    United States\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Pforzheimer\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1741543\" index=\"444\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/826/200/#p204\">\n    826 F.2d 200\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 204 (2d Cir. 1987) ; we are powerless to prevent state authorities who have obtained evidence in violation of the state constitution from providing it to federal authorities for their use in a federal prosecution, undermining both the legitimacy and value of protections granted by our state constitution. See, e.g., R. Range, supra,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"445\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=45%20Wash.%20%26%20Lee%20L.%20Rev.%201499\">\n    45 Wash. &amp; Lee L.

As Justice Zarella explains, under the interstitial approach, a court turns first to the federal constitutional claim, and only if the defendant cannot prevail on that claim does the court then consider the claim under the state constitution. Under the primacy approach, a court looks first to the state constitution and resorts to the federal constitution only if the defendant's state constitutional claim is unavailing. It is unclear to us why Justice Zarella advocates an interstitial approach even as he accepts the premise that a state constitutional claim is properly decided first when the federal constitutional issue remains unsettled. In any event, in our view, it is most sensible and practical simply to decide the constitutional claim under the federal constitution if the law thereunder is truly settled and the defendant prevails; if the law is not settled under the federal constitution, or if it is settled but in favor of the state, we then look first to the state constitution.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"25\">\n   <p id=\"p-162\">\n    Of course, there are other sound reasons to decide state constitutional issues first unless the issue is truly settled under the federal constitution; see, e.g., 1 J.

It is in large measure because of these \"significant distinctions\" that we cannot fairly say that the issue is truly settled under the federal constitution.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"29\">\n   <p id=\"p-166\">\n    We acknowledge that, generally, Second Circuit precedent presumptively carries particular weight with this court when we are\n    <em>\n     deciding\n    </em>\n    an issue of federal law. E.g.,\n    <em>\n     Szewczyk\n    </em>\n    v.\n    <em>\n     Dept. of Social Services\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3149505\" index=\"556\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/275/464/\">\n     275 Conn. 464\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 475,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"557\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=881%20A.2d%20259\">\n     881 A.2d 259\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (2005) (decisions of Second Circuit Court of Appeals \" 'carry particularly persuasive weight' \" in our interpretation of federal law). Contrary to Justice Zarella's assertion, however, this general principle has no applicability with respect to the threshold, and entirely separate, determination of\n    <em>\n     whether\n    </em>\n    to decide a claim first under the federal constitution or first under the state constitution. While there are sound reasons to give particular weight to the Second Circuit's interpretation of federal law when we are resolving a claim under federal law-most significantly, to avoid the situation in which a litigant would prevail on the identical federal claim in one jurisdiction but not in the other-no such consideration has any bearing on which constitutional claim should be decided first. This point-that a holding of the Second Circuit should not dictate the order in which we address claims raised under both the federal and state constitutions-may be illustrated as follows. If we address the state constitutional claim first and decide it in favor of the defendant, there is no reason to address the federal constitutional claim; for purposes of that case, the defendant is entitled to prevail under the state constitution, and it simply does not matter which way the claim would have been decided under the federal constitution. If we decide the state constitutional claim first, but the state prevails, we then must turn to the federal constitution to determine whether it affords greater protection to the defendant than the state constitution. In neither case is there any possibility that the very same claim would be decided differently under the same law because the defendant's two separate and distinct claims implicate two different constitutions.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-167\">\n    We also disagree with Justice Zarella that an issue of federal constitutional interpretation is settled solely because the Second Circuit has decided it in a certain way. Because the United States Supreme Court is the final arbiter of the meaning and scope of the federal constitution, we cannot reasonably characterize a federal constitutional issue as settled unless we can confidently predict how the United States Supreme Court would resolve it. If we are unable to do so-and, as we explain more fully hereinafter, we certainly cannot make such a prediction in the present case-there simply is no persuasive reason to address the issue first under the federal constitution. Consequently, there is no justification for this court to entertain the fiction, advocated by Justice Zarella, that a federal constitutional question is settled merely because it is settled in the Second Circuit. Ironically, because Justice Zarella acknowledges that we do not blindly follow Second Circuit precedent, if we were to adopt his approach and first address any issue of federal constitutional interpretation that has been resolved by the Second Circuit, we would be creating the very problem that Justice Zarella seeks to avoid, namely, the possibility that this court would disagree with the Second Circuit's interpretation of a federal constitutional provision.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"30\">\n   <p id=\"p-168\">\n    With respect to his repudiation of Justice Kagan's reliance on the privacy based rationale to support her determination that the conduct of the police in\n    <em>\n     Jardines\n    </em>\n    violated the fourth amendment, Justice Alito explained that he saw \"no basis for concluding that the occupants of a dwelling have a reasonable expectation of privacy in odors that emanate from the dwelling and reach spots where members of the public may lawfully stand.\"\n    <em>\n     Florida\n    </em>\n    v.\n    <em>\n     Jardines\n    </em>\n    , supra,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12696458\" index=\"558\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/569/1/#p1417\">\n     133 S.Ct. at 1424\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (Alito, J., dissenting).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-177\">\n    The majority observes that the state has not argued that the police had a reasonable and articulable suspicion that the defendant was growing marijuana plants in his condominium unit, or claimed that if it had, that suspicion would have justified the dog sniff.

Presented with this opportunity to include police dogs within this category, the court declined to do so. That is because dogs are different from advanced technology.\n   Advancements in technology trouble the court precisely because they are continually evolving, potentially\n   eroding society's reasonable expectations of privacy.

On the one hand, the court has attempted to craft rules that are flexible enough to anticipate more sophisticated means of surveillance and investigation that may become available to law enforcement. See, e.g.,\n   <em>\n    Kyllo\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    United States\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9312742\" index=\"631\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/533/27/#p34\">\n    533 U.S. at 36\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9312742\" index=\"632\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/533/27/#p34\">\n    121 S.Ct. 2038\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[w]hile the technology used in the present case was relatively crude, the rule we adopt must take account of more sophisticated systems that are already in use or in development\"). At the same time, however, the court has recognized that advancements in technology have had an unavoidable and undeniable effect on search and seizure law because they have changed what we may reasonably expect to remain private. For instance, the court observed in\n   <em>\n    Kyllo\n   </em>\n   that \"[i]t would be foolish to contend that the degree of privacy secured to citizens by the [f]ourth [a]mendment has been entirely unaffected by the advance of technology.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9312742\" index=\"633\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/533/27/#p34\">\n    Id., at 33-34\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9312742\" index=\"634\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/533/27/#p34\">\n    121 S.Ct. 2038\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The nature of a dog's sense of smell\n   has not changed over the years and there is no reason to believe that it will evolve in the way that technology does. Therefore, the scope of information yielded by a dog sniff, unlike the information yielded by technological devices, will remain sui generis-that information will always remain limited to indicating merely the presence or absence of contraband. Thus, there is no danger that a dog sniff will\n   evolve to the point of alerting officers to a detail such as \"at what hour each night the lady of the house takes her daily sauna and bath ....\"\n   <em>\n    Kyllo\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    United States\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9312742\" index=\"647\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/533/27/#p34\">\n    533 U.S. at 38\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9312742\" index=\"648\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/533/27/#p34\">\n    121 S.Ct. 2038\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The court explained that the Agema Thermovision 210 thermal imager used by the police in that case converted \"radiation into images based on relative warmth-black is cool, white is hot, shades of gray connote relative differences; in that respect, it operates somewhat like a video camera showing heat images.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9312742\" index=\"651\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/533/27/#p34\">\n    Id., at 29-30\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9312742\" index=\"652\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/533/27/#p34\">\n    121 S.Ct. 2038\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Thus, even if a dog is a \"device\" akin to a thermal imaging device, there has been no showing that it is a device that is somehow unavailable to the general public.

As I have explained, the United States Supreme Court has\n   <em>\n    never\n   </em>\n   treated dogs in the same manner that it has treated technology for purposes of the reasonable expectation of privacy test, and it declined to do so in\n   <em>\n    Jardines\n   </em>\n   .

I observe that most of the state court decisions relied on by the majority either predate\n   <em>\n    Jardines\n   </em>\n   or apply a curtilage analysis rather than the\n   <em>\n    Katz\n   </em>\n   reasonable expectation\n   of privacy test. See, e.g.,\n   <em>\n    People\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Burns\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"664\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=401%20Ill.%20Dec.%20468\">\n    401 Ill.Dec. 468\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"665\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=50%20N.E.3d%20610\">\n    50 N.E.3d 610\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 617-22 (2016) (applying\n   <em>\n    Jardines\n   </em>\n   curtilage inquiry to determine that dog sniff at entrance to defendant's apartment violated fourth amendment).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   I further observe that no dog sniff may be analyzed in a vacuum. This dog sniff occurred in the shared hallway of a multiunit building, not a single-family home. That fact is relevant to the defendant's reasonable expectation of privacy, which is analyzed under a very fact centered and common sense inquiry. When one lives in a unit that shares walls, floors and ceilings with other units, and shares the same hallway as others\n   in the building, it would be\n   <em>\n    unreasonable\n   </em>\n   to expect the same amount of privacy as that enjoyed in an independent dwelling place. This court has expressly recognized this principle: \"Reasonable expectations of privacy are necessarily diminished in [multifamily] homes and [multiunit] buildings, by virtue of the presence in common areas of other tenants and their visitors ....\" (Citations omitted.)\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Brown\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"558186\" index=\"666\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/198/348/#p356\">\n    198 Conn. 348\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 357,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"667\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=503%20A.2d%20566\">\n    503 A.2d 566\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1986). The majority's statement, therefore, that the defendant's reasonable expectation of privacy must be treated as though he lived in a single-family dwelling, is not supported by this court's precedent and cannot be reconciled with the facts of the case. The majority's claim is that its fiction is required because otherwise residents of multifamily buildings would enjoy lesser protection under article first, \u00a7 7, of the state constitution. That is simply not correct. Each person is protected against searches that compromise a reasonable expectation of privacy. The determination of what is reasonable is necessarily a fact intensive inquiry. Applying all of the relevant facts, including the facts that the procedure involved a dog rather than any advanced technology, and that it occurred in the common area of the condominium complex, I would hold that the defendant had no reasonable expectation of privacy in the odors that emanated into a shared hallway from his condominium unit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   I next consider whether the area of the shared hallway immediately adjacent to the door to the defendant's condominium unit constituted the curtilage of the unit, rendering the dog sniff a search pursuant to\n   <em>\n    Jardines\n   </em>\n   . The question is whether the area in front of the defendant's unit is akin to the front porch in\n   <em>\n    Jardines\n   </em>\n   . In\n   <em>\n    Jardines\n   </em>\n   , the officers walked onto the defendant's front porch with a drug sniffing dog, which sat at the base of the defendant's front door, indicating that it had detected one of the odors to which it had been trained\n   to respond.\n   <em>\n    Florida\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Jardines\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12696458\" index=\"668\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/569/1/#p1417\">\n    133 S.Ct. at 1413\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Under those facts, the court was quite clear that its conclusion was grounded in the fourth amendment's roots in property rights, specifically the law of trespass, and therefore turned on the fact that the officers had physically intruded on the defendant's property in order to conduct the canine investigation.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12696458\" index=\"669\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/569/1/#p1417\">\n    Id., at 1414\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Justice Scalia, writing for the majority, explained that \"[w]hen the [g]overnment obtains information by physically intruding on persons, houses, papers, or effects, a search within the original meaning of the [f]ourth [a]mendment has undoubtedly occurred.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12696458\" index=\"670\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/569/1/#p1417\">\n    Id.\n   </extracted-citation>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   Understood properly, therefore,\n   <em>\n    Jardines\n   </em>\n   was not a case about a dog-it was a case about a front porch. The police officers exceeded the limited license enjoyed by the public to enter onto a front porch-the fact that the intrusion involved a dog was not significant. The majority explained that \"[i]t is not the dog that is the problem, but the behavior that here involved use of the dog. We think a typical person would find it a cause for great alarm ... to find a stranger snooping about his front porch\n   <em>\n    with or without\n   </em>\n   a dog.\" (Citation\n   omitted; emphasis in original.)\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12696458\" index=\"671\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/569/1/#p1417\">\n    Id.,\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at 1416 n.3.

Privacy simply cannot be enjoyed in an area that is a shared space. The sole factor favoring the defendant is the proximity of the area to his home. Proximity alone, however, is not sufficient. If it were, then every public sidewalk that abuts the front of a home would constitute the curtilage of the home. Nothing in the record reveals that there was any enclosure separating\n   this area from the remainder of the shared hallway. Nor is there any suggestion that the area was used for any other purpose than passing through, either by the defendant on the way into and out of his unit, or by other residents and their visitors accessing their respective units. Nor did the defendant ever claim that he took any steps whatsoever to protect the area from observation by people passing by, and indeed it is questionable that he would be able to, given that he did not enjoy exclusive control of that area.
