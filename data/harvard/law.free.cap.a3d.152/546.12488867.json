The defendant claims that the trial court (1) violated her right to due process when it denied certain motions without a hearing, (2) erred in granting sole legal custody of the minor children to the plaintiff, (3) issued inequitable financial orders, and (4) erred in denying her motions for disqualification of the trial judge. We disagree and affirm the judgment of the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The following facts, as found by the trial court in a comprehensive memorandum of decision, are relevant. The parties were married in 1989. At the time of trial in 2014, the plaintiff was fifty years old and working as a letter carrier for the United States Postal Service. The defendant was forty-nine years old and working as a juvenile probation officer. The plaintiff's work schedule was inflexible. The defendant's schedule was comparatively flexible and she historically had been the primary parental figure in the children's lives. The parties have two children, the first born in 1998 and the second in 2002. At the time of trial, the defendant was residing alone at the marital home in Fairfield and the plaintiff was residing in a condominium in Monroe with the two children.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Following a trial, the court issued a memorandum of decision on March 17, 2014. A principal issue in the trial was the defendant's use of alcohol. The court did not credit the defendant's testimony that she did not drink much, although she said that she did use alcohol to cope with an emotionally abusive husband. The court, rather, found that the defendant had abused alcohol for a long period of time, at least since 2006. John Mager, the children's guardian ad litem, testified that the children had reported to him that the defendant had driven while intoxicated with them in the car on more than one occasion. On December 31, 2011, the defendant became intoxicated and was hospitalized.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Mager testified that the hospital records indicated that the defendant's blood alcohol level was .448 when she was admitted and that the defendant reported to intake staff that she routinely drank large amounts of vodka daily for the majority of her adult life. Michael Reitman, who was licensed as a clinical social worker and an alcohol and drug counselor, had treated the defendant since January, 2012. The defendant refused any other form of treatment and Reitman continually had urged the defendant to reconsider her refusal. Since December 31, 2011, the defendant had been successful in maintaining her sobriety, but continued to minimize her difficulty with alcohol.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The defendant's abuse of alcohol had a significant impact on the children. The plaintiff influenced to some extent the children's attitudes toward the defendant, but, in any event, the children's alignment with their father grew and they reported negative feelings toward the defendant even during the time from January, 2012, to October, 2012, when the defendant had primary care of the children and the plaintiff did not interfere with her activities with the children. After October, 2012, the children and the plaintiff moved out of the marital home in order to reduce the strife to which the children were being exposed. Mager testified that the defendant's unwillingness to accept responsibility for her actions without placing blame elsewhere prevented healing between her and the children.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The children preferred to have very little or no contact with the defendant. The court found that the best interests of the children required orders granting sole legal and physical custody to the plaintiff, that the defendant maintain her sobriety, and that the children maintain a relationship with both parents. The court so ordered and further specified that on a three week rotating basis the defendant was to have visitation with the younger child for three hours the first week, the older child for three hours the second week, and both\n   children for three hours the third week. The court ordered that the children, the plaintiff and, at an appropriate time, the defendant, were to engage in counseling with the \"goal and expectation that the parental access between the defendant and the minor children shall increase over time.\" The court also ordered that the defendant refrain from alcoholic beverages and submit to random alcohol testing; either a positive test or a failure to take a test would result in cancellation of that week's visitation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The court further ordered the defendant to pay $252 weekly in child support to the plaintiff and ordered that the parties share unreimbursed medical, dental and child care expenses. The plaintiff was to pay 53 percent and the defendant 47 percent. The court ordered that the parties' deferred income was subject to equitable distribution. The court did not order alimony. This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The defendant first claims that her right to due process was violated when the court denied without a hearing her motion for a continuance, her \"motion to open and set aside judgment and for new trial,\" her motion to reargue/reconsideration, and her motion for clarification.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Prior to the start of trial, and almost two years after the plaintiff initiated the action, the defendant filed a motion for a\n   continuance in which she argued that her attorney failed to prepare adequately for trial because she \"can no longer pay him.\" The court denied the motion without elaboration. In the course of a hearing on a postjudgment motion to disqualify the trial court, the defendant mentioned the court's previous denial of her pretrial motion for a continuance. The court at that time explained that \"issues relating to the custody of children are priority issues. This case has been pending for a long time. The matter was scheduled in advance. I don't continue custody trials absent extraordinary circumstances like illness or death.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   After the memorandum of decision was issued, the defendant filed several motions. One was entitled \"motion to open and set aside judgment and for new trial.\" In that motion she argued that a new trial was warranted because her trial counsel was \"ineffective\" in that he failed to prepare adequately for trial and engaged in \"threatening behaviors.\" She further claimed that Mager, the guardian ad litem, \"provided dishonest testimony throughout the trial.\" With respect to this issue, the defendant argued that Mager falsely had testified that he had spoken with Reitman. The defendant highlighted the court's finding that \"[Mager] testified that in his discussion with Reitman, the therapist had reported that he had recommended more intensive type treatments and that he had recommended that [the defendant] attend [Alcoholics Anonymous]. The defendant refused any other form of treatment and Reitman reported to [Mager] that he had continued to urge her to reconsider that decision.\" The defendant attached to the motion an affidavit by Reitman averring that he had neither spoken to nor met with Mager. She also noted the court's finding that \"[i]t was only through the efforts of [Mager] ... that vital information from the\n   St. Vincent's Hospital records were brought to the court's attention.\" She argued that the hospital records were not introduced into evidence and Mager \"testified to the contents of the record that were completely made up and false. Another willful act of perjury ....\" The court denied the motion for clarification.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The defendant also filed a motion to reargue, which claimed \"ineffective counsel and fraudulent testimony\" by Mager. This motion was denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The defendant filed a motion for clarification in which she stated that the court denied her \"motion to open and set aside judgment and for new trial\" without a hearing, and asked the court to clarify the legal basis upon which the court denied that motion. The court also denied this motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The defendant argues that \"[a]s a matter of law, the trial court's ... failure to afford a hearing on the defendant's motion for a continuance, motion to reopen judgment for a new trial based on perjury and ineffective counsel, motion to reargue/reconsider, and motion for clarification deprived the [defendant of her due process right] to be heard.\" Pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 11-18(a), however, whether to hear oral argument on motions in civil matters is a matter within the discretion of the court, except in limited circumstances, not relevant here, in which argument is a matter of right. Section 11-18(a) provides in relevant part: \"Oral argument is at the discretion of the judicial authority except as to motions to dismiss, motions to strike, motions for summary judgment, motions for judgment of foreclosure, and motions for judgment on the report of an attorney trial referee and/or hearing on any objections thereto....\" We review the claim of error in not hearing oral argument under an abuse of discretion standard. See\n   <em>\n    Brochard\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Brochard\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12485329\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/140/254/#p638\">\n    165 Conn.App. 626\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 638,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12485329\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/140/254/#p638\">\n    140 A.3d 254\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2016).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   It is clear, then, that the defendant was not entitled to oral argument as of right on her motion for a continuance, her \"motion to open and set aside judgment and for new trial,\" her motion to reargue/reconsideration, and her motion for clarification. The trial court's decisions not to hold evidentiary hearings with respect to these motions were, by the rules of practice and case authority, within its discretion. There is nothing in the record to indicate that the court abused its discretion in ruling on the motions without a hearing.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The defendant focuses her substantive argument regarding the disposition of her motions on her motion to open. She argues that Mager's \"testimony throughout the trial, while being under oath, was deceitful and willfully dishonest. That the defendant's counsel did not properly cross-examine [Mager] despite the defendant asking him to do so. In addition, the defendant's hospital records were never introduced as evidence. Yet, [Mager] dishonestly testified as to the contents of the record. Said testimony was completely fraudulent and deceitful. The trial court ... relied on [Mager's] false testimony. This resulted in significant harm being done to the defendant and her minor children.... It is clear in the memorandum of decision that the court based its recommendation on the testimony of [Mager]. However the new evidence clearly shows the court that a new trial would produce a different outcome, in light of the fact that a key witness for the plaintiff has committed acts of perjury.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The defendant presents two grounds for her argument that Mager's testimony was \"fraudulent.\" First,\n   she points to the court's statement in its memorandum of decision regarding Mager's testimony during trial. The court stated that Mager had testified that, during a discussion he had had with Reitman, Reitman indicated that he had urged the defendant to attend Alcoholics Anonymous and had also suggested that the defendant needed more treatment than what was being provided, but she refused. The statement, deemed fraudulent by the defendant, was never made. Although Mager testified about the underlying facts, he did not testify that he learned about the facts through a conversation with Reitman. That the court apparently incorrectly attributed the information in its memorandum of decision does not necessarily undermine the judgment; the manner in which Mager obtained this information is not a fact material to this case, and, thus, the finding as to attribution is harmless.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   See\n   <em>\n    Lambert\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Donahue\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2496657\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/78/493/#p507\">\n    78 Conn.App. 493\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 507,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=827%20A.2d%20729\">\n    827 A.2d 729\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2003) (\"Where ... some of the facts found [by the trial court] are clearly erroneous and others are supported by the evidence, we must examine the clearly erroneous findings to see whether they were harmless, not only in isolation, but also taken as a whole.... If, when taken as a whole, they undermine appellate confidence in the court's fact finding process, a new hearing is required.\" [Internal quotation marks omitted.] ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Second, the defendant states that Mager's testimony as to the contents of the\n   hospital records regarding the defendant's treatment for detoxification at St. Vincent's Hospital was intentionally inaccurate. Mager's testimony as to the content of the records was admitted into evidence without objection, however, and was not inconsistent with the testimony of the defendant's witness, Reitman; we note, however, that Reitman's testimony regarding the contents of the hospital records\n   was less comprehensive than that of Mager. Further, the defendant herself presumably could have introduced the hospital records themselves into evidence in order to contest Mager's version of events.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   In this respect, because any discrepancies could have been discovered at trial, the evidence could not have been newly discovered for purposes of a motion to open.\n   <em>\n    Worth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Korta\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4070844\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/132/154/#p160\">\n    132 Conn.App. 154\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 160-61,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=31%20A.3d%20804\">\n    31 A.3d 804\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2011) (evidence \"newly discovered\" for purposes of motion to open if \"it could not have been discovered earlier by the exercise of due diligence\" [emphasis omitted; internal quotation marks omitted] ), cert. denied,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=304%20Conn.%20905\">\n    304 Conn. 905\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=38%20A.3d%201201\">\n    38 A.3d 1201\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2012). It was clear from the motion to open itself that the defendant's assertions of perjury, in the absence of newly discovered documentation, lacked merit. The court did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion to open without an evidentiary hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The defendant next claims that the court erred in granting sole legal custody of the minor child to the plaintiff.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \"It is statutorily incumbent upon a court entering orders concerning custody or visitation or a modification of such order to be guided by the best interests of the child....

The court is not required to assign any weight to any of the factors that it considers, but shall articulate the basis for its decision....\"\n   The defendant argues that Mager's testimony relevant to the child's best interests was erroneous and should not have been relied on by the court. She claims he was mistaken in testifying, inter alia, that she had been drinking during the majority of her adult life, including large amounts of vodka daily, and in reporting that the children had no desire to have contact with her.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   She also contends that the court ignored\n   evidence favorable to her with respect to the \"best interest\" factors under \u00a7 46b-56. Most of her argument regarding these factors refers to abusive behavior on the part of the plaintiff and the claim that the children had stronger ties to the defendant than to the plaintiff.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The defendant essentially requests us to reassess the credibility of witnesses. \"[I]t is well established that the evaluation of a witness' testimony and credibility are wholly within the province of the trier of fact.... An appellate court must defer to the trier of fact's assessment of credibility because [i]t is the [fact finder] ...

The court found the testimony of Mager credible and the testimony of the defendant and her family, to the effect that her issues with alcohol were recent phenomena and were caused by the behavior of the plaintiff, not credible. We decline to second-guess this determination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The court found that the defendant had been successful in maintaining her sobriety since January, 2012, but she continued to minimize the significance and extent of her alcohol related difficulty. The court noted that it did not credit the testimony of the defendant or her family that her issues with alcohol were a short term reaction to circumstances. The court stated that it was not ignoring emotional abuse by the plaintiff, but that the defendant's placing blame elsewhere for her alcohol issues only placed her and the children at greater risk and prevented healing between the defendant and the children.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   The court, on the other hand, noted that the plaintiff encouraged the children's negative attitude toward the defendant and contributed to the breakdown of the marriage. The court nevertheless found that the children reported their feelings about the defendant in very negative terms, even when the defendant was the primary parent and the plaintiff was not interfering. The court found that the children considered the defendant's actions to be harmful to them. The court stated that the \"strong and consistent preference\" of the children was to have \"very limited contact with the defendant.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The court concluded that, despite the children's preference, \"the best interests of the children are served here by having a meaningful relationship with both parents.\" The court discussed the difficulty in achieving that goal in light of the strong views of the children and the facts that at least one child was almost sixteen at the time of trial and the children had not experienced helpful therapy during the pendency of trial. The court concluded by noting that \"the defendant's request for joint legal custody is shocking based on the reality of this case and truly demonstrates the defendant's total lack of insight into her children and the impact her alcoholism has had on them.... She and the plaintiff have not been able to communicate\n   on any meaningful level for a very long period of time. While such a lack of co-parenting communication is not completely her fault under any sense of the concept it is simply not a viable path for protecting the minor children and promoting their best interests at this time.\" Although the court ordered that the defendant's visitation with the children was set at three hours per week, contingent upon the defendant refraining from alcoholic beverages, the court also ordered that the children engage in therapy with the goal of increasing the defendant's access to them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   It is clear that the court carefully examined all of the evidence, analyzed the \u00a7 46b-56 factors, and determined that it was in the children's best interest to award sole custody to the plaintiff. \"The controlling principle in a determination respecting custody is that the court shall be guided by the best interests of the child.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Ford\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Ford\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1213518\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/68/173/#p187\">\n    68 Conn.App. 173\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 187,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=789%20A.2d%201104\">\n    789 A.2d 1104\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , cert. denied,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"831889,831949,831869\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/260/910/\">\n    260 Conn. 910\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=796%20A.2d%20556\">\n    796 A.2d 556\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2002).

The court expressed the \"goal and expectation that the parental access between the defendant and the minor children shall increase over time ....\" The court further ordered that the children were free to contact the defendant any time and the plaintiff was not to interfere, except incident to legitimate discipline.

He stated that he was unable to find a therapist in the immediate geographical area with a PhD because some declined to provide services after hearing about the file and the others declined after reviewing the memorandum of decision. Mager testified that there seemed to be a trend that therapists refuse to take on high conflict divorce cases. The defendant, who was self-represented at the hearing, questioned Mager regarding whether he was adverse to the children engaging in therapy and about her concerns regarding Mager as the children's guardian ad litem. The court sustained the objections of the plaintiff's attorney as to these questions and then stated that \"the attack on the therapeutic community by litigants who have not been successful in court has, obviously, made many of these therapists adverse to getting involved in these cases. They're getting sued and there's plenty of therapy work for people who are not involved in litigation.... That's tragic because you and these girls need some therapeutic assistance ....\" The court explained, \"I'm going to have to go down the stream to other therapeutic individuals because you and others like you have created a hostile environment ....\" The defendant argues that this statement by the court indicated bias and that the court's orders were punitive. We do not agree.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-66\">\n    In the course of its remarks, the court was restating Mager's testimony regarding a trend in the provision of care by therapists in high conflict divorce cases, such as the current case. The court's statements at a postjudgment hearing, in which an issue was whether orders in the memorandum of decision had been executed, do not reflect bias in crafting orders months earlier in its memorandum of decision. The court's statements reflect its findings in the memorandum of decision that the defendant refused to authorize communications between the family relations counselor and one of the therapists, that the selection of a co-parenting counselor was unduly delayed at least in part due to the defendant's procrastination, that, when therapists were found, the defendant ended therapy more than once, claiming that the therapist was not working well with the children or the parties, and that the children blamed the defendant for undermining their therapy and were unwilling to engage in more therapy.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-67\">\n    The court, then, expressed factual findings leading to a conclusion that the defendant was making progress difficult; the court further noted, essentially, that such behavior extrapolated over a larger population caused difficulty for many people.
