The court also found that the petitioner\n   was not prejudiced by his trial counsel's performance. Specifically, the court correctly and succinctly found that Quinones, in a subsequent statement to police, \"specifically identif[ied] the petitioner as the shooter,\" and that counsel's decision not to attempt to offer the statement regarding the neck tattoos \"was based on their carefully considered legal opinions and experience ....\" The court found that counsel \"did not think the initial statement qualified as an excited utterance\" and were concerned about the possibility of the state offering Quinones' second statement identifying the petitioner as the shooter into evidence as a response to any attempt to introduce the statement regarding the neck tattoos. The court further refused to \"assume that the jury would have credited the oral statement offered by the defense to such a degree that it would have overcome not only the evidence in the trial record, but a later identification by that same witness of the petitioner as the killer.\" These determinations, combined with the state's \"strong case against the petitioner, including several eyewitnesses to the murder of the victim,\" supported a finding that the petitioner had not suffered any prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   We note that \"our review of an attorney's performance is especially deferential when his or her decisions are the result of relevant strategic analysis....

Specifically, the petitioner asserts that there was no reasonable basis for the state to present Quinones as a witness to testify with regard to her identification of the petitioner as the shooter due to her violation of a sequestration order. However, the petitioner does not cite any case law to support his argument that the sole remedy to a violation of a sequestration order is to preclude that witness' testimony in its entirety. In fact, while a court \"may choose to preclude a witness from testifying or to strike a witness' testimony to remedy unfairness resulting from a violation ... the exclusion of witness testimony ... is not the preferred remedy for a violation of a sequestration order.\" (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Guerrera\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12486212\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/142/447/#p99\">\n    167 Conn.App. 74\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 99,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12486212\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/142/447/#p99\">\n    142 A.3d 447\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , cert. granted on other grounds,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12488049,12488045,12488046\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/323/922/\">\n    323 Conn. 922\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12488048,12488049,12488050\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/150/1152/\">\n    150 A.3d 1152\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2016).

Two of those three also testified that the shooter was five feet seven inches or five feet eight inches. One in-court witness testified that the petitioner was the shooter, but refused to look at him for in-court identification. The trial court noted that it had \"very reluctant, frightened ... witnesses in this case.\"\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-34\">\n    According to the record, the petitioner does not have neck tattoos, and, therefore, it was of value to the petitioner to have eyewitness testimony describing the shooter as having such. In an oral statement to Mertes on the night of the murder, Quinones described the tattoos as praying hands on the right side of the shooter's neck, and Japanese writing on the left side. The petitioner alleges in his brief that another witness, Norman Figueroa, also described the shooter as having neck tattoos. However, Figueroa's alleged statement is not corroborated by the record, nor does the petitioner argue that the statement should have been presented by trial counsel, and there is no mention or analysis of any impact of such potential testimony in the petitioner's brief. We therefore deem this argument abandoned and decline to review it. See\n    <em>\n     Fradianni\n    </em>\n    v.\n    <em>\n     Protective Life Ins.

Mertes testified at the habeas trial that Quinones appeared excited and upset while describing the shooter. The petitioner relies on this testimony in an attempt to argue that Quinones' statement would unequivocally have been admitted under the spontaneous utterance exception to the hearsay rule. This is not necessarily so. The record reflects that Mertes did not have immediate contact with her after the shooting.

In sum, the petitioner argues that this court should conclude that the failure of trial counsel to present Quinones' testimony is equivalent to a\n    <em>\n     Brady\n    </em>\n    violation because of its exculpatory content. This is incorrect and must be addressed. Prosecutors have a duty under\n    <em>\n     Brady\n    </em>\n    and rule 3.8 (4) of the Rules of Professional Conduct to disclose \"to the defense ... all evidence or information known to the prosecutor that tends to negate the guilt of the accused or mitigates the offense ....\" No such duty applies to defense counsel. As explained previously, defense counsel has the discretion to make a strategic decision whether to present a witness' statement that, although potentially exculpatory in nature, may hurt rather than help the defense's case.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
