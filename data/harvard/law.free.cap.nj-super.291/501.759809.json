The motion judge concluded that the search was so closely contemporaneous with defendant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>arrest that it was incidental to defendant\u2019s arrest. We disagree and reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b532-6\">The sole witness for the State at defendant\u2019s suppression hearing was Detective William Ames. Ames testified that on September 24, 1993, he was dispatched to Bally\u2019s Park Place Casino and Hotel to investigate a possible credit card fraud. The police had been contacted by a representative of the casino security department. Ames indicated that he took between ten and fifteen minutes to travel to the casino.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-7\">On arrival at Bally\u2019s, Ames learned that defendant was being held at a Bally\u2019s satellite detaining office in the hotel and near the casino. Ames learned that defendant had approached a cash advance booth and presented a driver\u2019s license and a MasterCard credit card bearing the name Michael Brown in an attempt to charge a cash advance of $1,000 against the MasterCard account.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-8\">A written report of the investigation was subsequently prepared. Ames read from that report at the suppression hearing. He wrote, \u201cThe cashier, Ms. Brown, advised me that upon cheeking the printed check against the credit card she realized that the numbers did not match, she also realized that the Virginia drivers license used as ID was fraudulent/fake. She contacted security and the accused was taken into custody in the north tower area after he tried to flee the area.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b532-9\">Ames found defendant in the satellite detaining office, which he described as \u201cvery small,\u201d with a desk and one or two chairs. Present with defendant were Bally\u2019s security supervisor and one or two Bally\u2019s security personnel.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-10\">Defendant was placed under arrest and handcuffed. Ames testified that he believed he handcuffed defendant across his back. After defendant was handcuffed, Ames conducted a pat-down search. Defendant did not possess any weapon. A Georgia driver\u2019s license, bearing defendant\u2019s name, was found on defen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>dant\u2019s person. In the detaining office at the time was a brown leather case belonging to defendant. The case was not in defendant\u2019s possession during his detention. Ames described the case as a saddle bag with a flap that came over the top and one or two buckles to secure the flap.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-6\">After searching defendant, Ames escorted him to the Division of Gaming Enforcement Office in Bally\u2019s Casino located two floors above the satellite detaining office. That walk took three to four minutes. Defendant\u2019s ease was carried by another person. Ames indicated that all investigations conducted at casino hotels are conducted in the Gaming Enforcement office. At the Bally\u2019s facility, that office includes a small monitor room, a bathroom, and a larger room with desks. Present were Ames, defendant, two or three Bally\u2019s security personnel, and Detective Weidel, who had been dispatched separately by the police to the casino to assist Ames in the investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-7\">Det. Ames advised defendant of his <em>Miranda</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>rights and defendant signed a <em>Miranda </em>card indicating that he understood his rights. After warning defendant of his rights, Det. Ames commenced his investigation of the alleged crime, beginning with a search of defendant\u2019s leather case. Det. Ames asked questions of defendant while going through his case. The search revealed numerous false identifications with defendant\u2019s photographs, credit cards issued to names other than defendant\u2019s and other personal items. Det. Ames testified that five to ten minutes elapsed from the time he placed defendant under arrest to the time he searched defendant\u2019s briefcase. No attempt was made by Ames to obtain a formal search warrant or a telephonic search warrant prior to the search of defendant\u2019s leather case.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-8\">On cross-examination, Ames indicated that while in the satellite detaining office, defendant never reached for or tried to grab his leather case. Defendant also made no such attempt while walking to the Gaming Enforcement office or after they reached that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>office. Defendant did not attempt to flee and engaged in no assaultive behavior with the security personnel or with the detectives.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-5\">The motion judge determined that the search of defendant\u2019s briefcase was a lawful search incident to defendant\u2019s lawful arrest. The judge explained,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b534-6\">Now, because there was some little bit of time that elapsed between the arrest, the detention and the then searching of the briefcase, that is of no moment____ This Defendant was secured, but the search came so closely contemporaneous with the arrest that certainly this search is a proper search of this Defendant\u2019s person, his briefcase and that is even though he did not have ready access to the briefcase.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b534-9\">In reaching this conclusion, the motion judge relied exclusively on <em>State v. Grass, </em>250 <em>N.J.Super. </em>74, 593 A.2d 379 (App.Div.1991). In <em>Grass, </em>the defendant\u2019s motor vehicle was pulled over for speeding. <em>Id. </em>at 75, 593 A.2d 379. The police discovered that the defendant\u2019s license had been suspended and arrested him. <em>Id. </em>at 76, 593 A.2d 379. The defendant was handcuffed and placed in the back seat of the officer\u2019s squad car. <em>Ibid. </em>Two or three minutes later, the officer searched the defendant\u2019s vehicle and found a gun and cocaine. <em>Ibid. </em>We concluded that the search in question was conducted \u201cimmediately\u201d after the arrest. <em>Id. </em>at 78, 593 A.2d 379. We consequently upheld the search as a valid incident to the defendant\u2019s arrest under <em>New York v. Belton, </em>453 <em>U.S. </em>454, 101 <em>S.Ct. </em>2860, 69 L.Ed.2d 768 (1981), which addressed the authority to search an automobile incident to arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-10\">In <em>State v. Barksdale, </em>224 <em>N.J.Super. </em>404, 540 A.2d 901 (App.Div.1988), we had occasion to review <em>Belton, </em>and observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b534-11\"><em>Belton </em>requires the search of the passenger compartment of a motor vehicle as an incident to a lawful arrest of the occupants to be contemporaneous with the arrest; the scope of the search is limited to \u201cthe area into which an arrestee might reach in order to grab a weapon or evidentiary item.\u201d ... <em>Belton </em>does not alter the underlying rationale for this type of search; it establishes a bright line rule which extends the area to be searched to encompass the entire passenger compartment of a motor vehicle including closed containers within the passenger compartment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AVe\"><em>[Id. </em>at 413-14, 540 A.2d 901 (quoting <em>Chimel v. California, </em>395 <em>U.S. </em>752, 763, 89 <em>S.Ct. </em>2034, 2040, 23 L.Ed.2d 685, 694 (1969)).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b534-12\">Using the concepts articulated in <em>Belton, </em>we were able to conclude in <em>Grass </em>that the fact that the defendant was handcuffed and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>situated in the rear of the squad car at the time of the search was of no import.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-6\">Subsequent to our decision in <em>Grass, </em>the Supreme Court in <em>State v. Pierce, </em>136 <em>N.J. </em>184, 642 A.2d 947 (1994), had occasion to reevaluate the implications of <em>Belton. Pierce </em>specifically focused upon \u201cthe scope of a police officer\u2019s authority to conduct a search of articles contained in the passenger compartment of an automobile following the arrest of the driver for operating the vehicle while his license is suspended.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 186, 642 A.2d 947. <em>Pierce </em>involved the same stop and search as in <em>Grass, supra </em>Pierce was a passenger in the car owned and driven by Grass. Although the Supreme Court concluded that the custodial arrest of co-defendant Grass for operating a motor vehicle during the period in which his driver\u2019s license had been suspended was proper, it concluded that a search of Grass\u2019s vehicle was improper under the circumstances of that case.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 205, 215, 642 A.2d 947. The Supreme Court left open the question whether <em>Belton </em>was compatible with the New Jersey Constitution. <em>Pierce, supra, </em>136 <em>N.J. </em>at 208, 642 A.2d 947.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-7\">We find that the motion judge\u2019s reliance on <em>Grass </em>was inappropriate, as that case justified the search on the special distinctions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>which have evolved in those eases related to automobile stops. In addition, <em>Grass </em>may have been tacitly overruled by <em>Pierce. </em>In any event, the body of law interpreting the Fourth Amendment allows greater flexibility to the arresting police officer to conduct a search following a stop of a motor vehicle than to search the defendant\u2019s personalty subsequent to the arrest of a defendant in a non-motor vehicle setting. The motion judge therefore should not have evaluated the issues raised by defendant\u2019s motion to suppress in the context of principles governing motor vehicle searches. Though there is some overlap of legal principles in these two search categories, there are also substantial differences.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-5\">A salient principle stressed by the United States Supreme Court is:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b536-6\">Once law enforcement officers have reduced luggage or other personal property not immediately associated with the person of the arrestee to their exclusive control, and there is no longer any danger that the arrestee might gain access to the property to seize a weapon or destroy evidence, a search of that property is no longer an incident of the arrest.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b536-7\"><em>[United States v. Chadwick, </em>433 <em>U.S. </em>1, 15, 97 <em>S.Ct. </em>2476, 2485, 53 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>538, 551 (1977).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b536-9\"><em>Belton </em>may modify this principle, at least insofar as the United States Supreme Court is concerned, by broadening the search authority of police officers with respect to searches incident to arrests that involve automobiles. We nonetheless find the statement in <em>Chadwick </em>to be controlling in non-automobile cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-10\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b536-11\">The Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution reads in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b536-12\">The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b536-14\"><em>[U.S. Const </em>amend. IV.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b536-15\">Article 1, paragraph 7 of the 1947 New Jersey Constitution includes identical language. <em>N.J. Const, </em>art. I, It 7. Both constitutional provisions require \u201cthe approval of an impartial judicial officer based on probable cause before most searches may be undertaken.\u201d <em>State v. Patino, </em>83 <em>N.J. </em>1, 7, 414 A.2d 1327 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b537-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>A search without judicial approval in the form of a warrant is presumed invalid. <em>State v. Valencia, </em>93 <em>N.J. </em>126, 133, 459 A.2d 1149 (1983); <em>State v. Judge, </em>275 <em>N.J.Super. </em>194, 199, 645 A.2d 1224 (App.Div.1994). The warrant requirement may be dispensed with in only a few narrowly circumscribed exceptions; the State has the burden of validating a warrantless search by bringing it within one of these exceptions. <em>Patino, supra, </em>83 <em>N.J. </em>at 7, 414 A.2d 1327. The State must prove the validity of such a search by a preponderance of the evidence. <em>Id. </em>at 13, 414 A.2d 1327; <em>Judge, supra, </em>275 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 199, 645 A.2d 1224.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-6\">One traditional and universally recognized exception to the prohibition against warrantless searches is the search incident to lawful arrest. <em>United States v. Robinson, </em>414 <em>U.S. </em>218, 224, 94 <em>S.Ct. </em>467, 471, 38 L.Ed.2d 427, 434 (1973). When a suspect is lawfully placed under arrest, a law enforcement officer may conduct a search of the person of the suspect as well as the area within the suspect\u2019s immediate control. <em>Ibid.; Chadwick, supra, </em>433 <em>U.S. </em>at 14-15, 97 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2485, 53 L.Ed.2d at 550; <em>Chimel v.

Such a search is permitted to protect the safety of the officer and to preserve evidence that may be destroyed or removed. <em>Chadwick, supra, </em>433 <em>U.S. </em>at 14-15, 97 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2485, 53 L.Ed.2d at 550; <em>Chimel, supra, </em>395 <em>U.S. </em>at 762-63, 89 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2040, 23 L.Ed.2d at 694; <em>Patino, supra, </em>83 <em>N.J. </em>at 8, 414 A.2d 1327; <em>State v.

The safety of a police officer will nevertheless not justify a search \u201cthrough closed or concealed places beyond the control or reach of the defendant even though in the area of the arrest itself.\u201d <em>Patino, supra, </em>83 <em>N.J. </em>at 8, 414 A.2d 1327.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-5\">A search incident to an arrest must be contemporaneous with that arrest. <em>Chadwick, supra, </em>433 <em>U.S. </em>at 15, 97 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2485, 53 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 550; <em>State v.

Parker, </em>153 <em>N.J.Super. </em>481, 489, 380 A.2d 291 (App.Div.1977) (holding that once the threat to an officer\u2019s safety and the evidence\u2019s preservation has passed, police cannot search personal effects of an arrestee). In <em>Doyle, </em>the New Jersey Supreme Court illustrated what it means by \u201ccontemporaneous:\u201d \u201cIt is sufficient if the valid arrest and search are reasonably contemporaneous, that is, they occur as parts of a single transaction, as connected units of an integrated incident.\u201d 42 <em>N.J. </em>at 343, 200 A.2d 606. In <em>State v. Ercolano, </em>79 <em>N.J. </em>25, 397 A.2d 1062 (1979), the Court explained that a search is not incidental to an arrest if it takes place at a different time and place than the arrest. <em>Id. </em>at 36 n. 2, 397 A.2d 1062.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-6\">The authority of police officers to search a suspect incident to arrest includes the power to search a container found in the suspect\u2019s possession at the time of arrest. <em>United States v. Ross, </em>456 <em>U.S. </em>798, 822-23, 102 <em>S.Ct. </em>2157, 2171-72, 72 L.Ed.2d 572, 592 (1982). <em>See also Texas v.

The issue as stated by the Court was whether a search warrant is required before a law enforcement official may open a locked footlocker which he has lawfully seized at the time of the arrest of its owners, when there is probable cause to believe that the locker contains contraband. 433 <em>U.S. </em>at 3, 97 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2479, 53 L.Ed.2d at 543. In <em>Chadwick, </em>Amtrak officials in San Diego observed a suspicious trunk being loaded onto a train bound for Boston. <em>Ibid. </em>Federal agents in San Diego alerted agents in Boston, who went to the Boston train station to await the arrival of the trunk. <em>Ibid. </em>When the trunk arrived in Boston, the defendant claimed it and placed it in the trunk of his car. <em>Id. </em>at 4, 97 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2479, 53 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 543. The federal agents arrested the defendant and his car was towed to the federal building in Boston. <em>Id. </em>at 4, 97 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2479-80, 53 L.Ed.2d at 543-44.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-7\">An hour and a half after the arrest, the agents opened the trunk and found marijuana. <em>Id. </em>at 5, 97 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2480, 53 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 544. The government conceded that the footlocker had been under the agents\u2019 exclusive control from the time of the arrest until it was opened. <em>Id. </em>at 4, 97 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2480, 53 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 544. Furthermore, there was no risk that the contents would have been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>removed and there was no risk to the safety of the agents. <em>Ibid. </em>The government tried to justify the search as incident to the defendant\u2019s arrest. <em>Id. </em>at 14, 97 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2485, 53 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 550. It maintained that the search of a container incident to arrest is permissible as long as the seizure of the container is contemporaneous with the arrest and the search is conducted \u201cas soon thereafter as [is] practicable.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b540-5\">The Court held that the defendant had an expectation of privacy in his locked trunk. <em>Id. </em>at 11, 97 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2483, 53 L.Ed.2d at 548. It also found no exigency which would justify a warrantless search. <em>Ibid. </em>The Court thus concluded that the warrantless search had been unreasonable. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b540-6\">The Court reiterated the principles announced in <em>Chimel </em>that a search incident to arrest is permitted to protect the safety of law enforcement officers and to preserve evidence that is in danger of being removed or destroyed. <em>Id. </em>at 14, 97 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2485, 53 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 550. Officers are authorized to search the person of the arrestee and the area within his immediate control. <em>Ibid. </em>\u201cSuch searches may be conducted without a warrant, and they may also be made whether or not there is probable cause to believe that the person arrested may have a weapon or is about to destroy evidence.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b540-7\">A search of a container incident to arrest is not without its limitations, however. \u201c[W]arrantless searches of luggage or other property seized at the time of arrest cannot be justified as incident to that arrest either if the \u2018search is remote in time or place from the arrest\u2019 or no exigency exists.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 15, 97 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2485, 53 <em>L.Ed.</em>2d at 550-51 (quoting <em>Preston v. United States, </em>376 <em>U.S. </em>364, 367, 84 <em>S.Ct. </em>881, 883, 11 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>777 (1964)).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-8\">Once law enforcement officers have reduced luggage or other personal properly not immediately associated with the person of the arrestee to their exclusive control, and there is no longer any danger that the arrestee might gain access to the properly to seize a weapon or destroy evidence, a search of that property is no longer an incident of the arrest.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-9\"><em>[Id. </em>at 15, 97 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2485, 53 L.Ed.2d at 551.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b541-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>Because the search occurred an hour and a half after the arrest and both the defendant and the footlocker were clearly in the control of the federal agents, the Court held that the search of the footlocker was not incident to the defendant\u2019s arrest. <em>Ibid. See also State v. Ercolano, </em>79 <em>N.J. </em>25, 36 n. 3, 397 A.2d 1062 (1979) (holding that a warrantless search of a car towed from an arrestee\u2019s apartment building conducted one and a half hours later is not incidental to the arrest because it took place at a different time and location than the arrest). That a search warrant would have been issued matter had one been requested, was of no consequence to the Court\u2019s decision. <em>Chadwick, supra, </em>433 <em>U.S. </em>at 15, 97 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2485, 53 L.Ed.2d at 551.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-6\">The Court\u2019s decision in <em>Chadwick </em>is consistent with its previous opinion in <em>Arkansas v. Sanders, </em>442 <em>U.S. </em>753, 99 <em>S.Ct. </em>2586, 61 L.Ed.2d 235 (1979). In <em>Sanders, </em>police officers removed a suitcase from a lawfully-stopped vehicle. <em>Id. </em>at 755, 99 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2588, 61 L.Ed.2d at 239. The Court was concerned with the privacy rights that a person possesses in luggage that is kept in a motor vehicle. The Court did not expressly address searches incident to arrest. The Court concluded that persons have a privacy interest in luggage and this privacy interest is in no way affected by the fact that the luggage may be in an automobile. <em>Id. </em>at 764 n. 13, 99 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2593 n. 13, 61 L.Ed.2d at 245 n. 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-7\">Although the Court did not analyze the search as one incident to arrest, it stated in dicta that the search of a container incident to arrest will be reasonable only if the container is in the \u201cimmediate control\u201d of the arrestee. <em>Id. </em>at 763 n. 11, 99 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2593 n. 11, 61 <em>L.Ed. </em>2d at 245 n. 11. The Court wrote, \u201cWhere ... police, without endangering themselves or risking loss of the evidence, lawfully have detained one suspected of criminal activity and secured his suitcase, they should delay the search thereof until after judicial approval has been obtained.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 766, 99 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2594, 61 L.Ed.2d at 246. Although this case was not decided as a search of a container incident to arrest, the Court\u2019s language is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>instructive as to a person\u2019s rights in containers and luggage that are in his or her possession.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-5\">New Jersey courts have abided by the standards announced in <em>Chimel </em>and <em>Chadwick </em>concerning searches of containers incident to arrest. In <em>State v. Patino, </em>83 <em>N.J. </em>1, 414 A.2d 1327 (1980), the New Jersey Supreme Court confronted an issue similar to that in <em>Chadwick. </em>During a routine traffic stop, a New Jersey State Trooper observed what he believed to be marijuana in plain view on the floor next to the front seat of the defendant\u2019s vehicle. <em>Id. </em>at 5, 414 A.2d 1327 (quoting <em>State v. Patino, </em>163 <em>N.J.Super. </em>116, 119-20, 394 A.2d 365 (App.Div.1978)). The trooper arrested the driver and passenger and searched the passenger compartment of the vehicle. <em>Id. </em>at 5-6, 414 A.2d 1327. The search of the passenger compartment revealed nothing. <em>Id. </em>at 6, 414 A.2d 1327.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-6\">The trooper next searched the trunk of the vehicle. <em>Ibid. </em>The trunk contained a shopping bag which was found to contain cocaine. <em>Ibid. </em>The State attempted to justify the search as being incident to the defendants\u2019 arrest for possession of marijuana. <em>Id. </em>at 7, 414 A.2d 1327.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-7\">After examining the history and scope of the search incident to arrest, the Court commented,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b542-8\">[W]e do not see any circumstances in this case which would lead a police officer reasonably to believe that two arrestees patted down and therefore presumably free of weapons on their persons, and detained at the front of the automobile, might be able to gain access to an enclosed automobile trunk in such a way as to endanger or overpower an armed, albeit unaided, state trooper, or to enable them to destroy evidence contained therein.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b542-9\">[Id. at 9, 414 A.2d 1327.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b542-10\">The Court concluded that the search was not necessary either to protect the safety of the trooper or to preserve evidence. <em>Ibid. </em>The Court consequently found that the search was not incident to arrest. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b542-11\">Although <em>Patino </em>did not involve the search of a container incident to arrest, the Court\u2019s opinion is instructive as to the treatment in general of searches incident to arrest. <em>Patino </em>suggests, for instance, that only the area within the immediate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>control of an arrestee may be searched. This rule applies even if the search is found to be contemporaneous with the arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-6\">These issues are fact sensitive and the facts must be carefully examined. <em>See, e.g., State in the Interest of A.R., </em>216 <em>N.J.Super. </em>280, 523 A.2d 678 (App.Div.1987) (holding that the contemporaneous search of a leather pouch was an incident to arrest); <em>State v. DeLorenzo, </em>166 <em>N.J.Super. </em>483, 400 A.2d 99 (App.Div.1979) (holding that although the seizure of a duffle bag was justified by exigent circumstances, a search of the duffle bag was not justified) (citing <em>Chadwick, supra, </em>433 <em>U.S. </em>at 15, 97 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2485, 53 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 551); <em>State v. Barksdale, </em>224 <em>N.J.Super. </em>404, 540 A.2d 901 (App.Div.1988) (finding that a search of an automobile ten minutes after an arrest was not an incident of the arrest); <em>State v. Grass, </em>250 <em>N.J.Super. </em>74, 593 A.2d 379 (App.Div.1991) (finding that a search conducted two or three minutes after an arrest was incidental to the arrest); <em>State v. Evans, </em>181 <em>N.J.Super. </em>455, 438 A.2d 340 (App.Div.1981) (holding that since defendant emerged from an automobile carrying a \u201csuitcase or briefcase type bag,\u201d a search of that bag was a lawful incident of the arrest).</p>\n<p id=\"b543-7\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b543-8\">Applying these principles to the facts of this case, we find most notably that the search of defendant\u2019s satchel commenced at least ten minutes after he was arrested by Ames and at least twenty-five minutes after he was detained by two or three security personnel employed by Bally\u2019s. <em>Chadwick </em>declared that a search will not be permitted if it is remote in time and place from the arrest. The search under review was conducted in the Casino Enforcement office, two floors above the satellite detaining office and four minutes distant. The search clearly was not part \u201cof a single transaction, as connected units of an integrated incident,\u201d as proposed in <em>Doyle.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b543-9\">Defendant was handcuffed at the time of the search and his bag was in the exclusive possession of the police officers. Defendant clearly could not reasonably have been expected to gain possession <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>of the bag, either to remove a weapon or to remove or destroy evidence therein. <em>Chadwick </em>held that a search of a container is no longer an incident to an arrest once law enforcement officials have taken exclusive control of the container. Furthermore, an arrestee cannot be presumed to be superhuman. <em>Barksdale, supra, </em>224 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 415-16, 540 A.2d 901.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-5\">Although <em>Grass, </em>if it is still viable, may authorize a search following handcuffing within two to three minutes of the arrest, <em>Grass </em>was a search incidental to an automobile stop. The motion judge should have analyzed the facts presented utilizing standards relevant to non-motor vehicle searches.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b544-7\">On appeal, the State contends for the first time that the fruits of the search should be admitted under the inevitable discovery doctrine. <em>See State v. Johnson, </em>120 <em>N.J. </em>263, 576 A.2d 834 (1990); <em>State v. Sugar, </em>100 <em>N.J. </em>214, 495 A.2d 90 (1985). The State argues that defendant\u2019s satchel ultimately would have been searched pursuant to administrative inventory procedures. <em>See Illinois v. Lafayette, </em>462 <em>U.S. </em>640, 643, 103 <em>S.Ct. </em>2605, 2608, 77 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>65, 69 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b544-8\">Defendant urges that an issue raised for the first time on appeal should not be entertained by the Appellate Division. <em>See Docteroff v. Barra Corp., </em>282 <em>N.J.Super. </em>230, 237, 659 A.2d 948 (App.Div.1995); <em>Borough of Dunellen v. F. Montecalvo Contracting Co., Inc., </em>273 <em>N.J.Super. </em>23, 30, 640 A.2d 1185 (App.Div.1994); <em>Murin v. Frapaul Construction Co., </em>240 <em>N.J.Super. </em>600, 613, 573 A.2d 989 (App.Div.1990); <em>State v. Mahoney, </em>226 <em>N.J.Super. </em>617, 626, 545 A.2d 235 (App.Div.1988). A review of the transcript of the suppression hearing reveals that the State did not present this argument to the trial court. We therefore will disregard this argument. <em>See R. </em>2:10-2. We certainly do not consider as plain error the failure to address <em>sua sponte </em>the inevitable discovery concept, especially in the absence of any evidence that would have justified an inventory at the scene of the arrest of the contents of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>a closed satchel. <em>See R. </em>1:7-5; <em>State v. Mangold, </em>82 <em>N.J. </em>575, 414 A.2d 1312 (1980); <em>State v. Mahoney, </em>226 <em>N.J.Super. </em>617, 545 A.2d 235 (App.Div.1988); <em>State v. Pace, </em>171 <em>N.J.Super. </em>240, 408 A.2d 808 (App.Div.1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b545-6\">The motion to suppress should have been granted.
