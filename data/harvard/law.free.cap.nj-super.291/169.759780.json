We are satisfied from our review of the record and the arguments presented that plaintiff\u2019s claim against Union County must fail. Pursuant to <em>N.J.S.</em>A. 59:9-2(d), plaintiff may not recover against a public entity for pain and suffering resulting from permanent psychological injury, unless such injury results in a \u201cpermanent loss of a bodily function, permanent disfigurement or dismemberment\u201d and \u201cthe medical treatment expenses are in excess of $1,000.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Plaintiff\u2019s medical expenses met the threshold but his psychological impairment, without any evidence of physical injury, was not a qualifying injury. <em>See Ayers v. Jackson Township, </em>106 <em>N.J. </em>557, 576-77, 525 A.2d 287 (1987). Without a qualifying injury, plaintiff may not recover his medical expenses related to his psychological impairments or for permanency relating to his emotional distress claim. <em>Ibid. </em>All of the issues of law raised are without merit. <em>See R. </em>2:ll-3(e)(l)E.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-9\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
