Mehlman, and the individual defendants were employees of defendant Mobil Oil Corporation (Mobil). Mehlman claimed that Mobil had discharged him in retaliation for his objecting to excessive levels (over 5%) of benzene, a toxic substance, in gasoline produced and sold by Mobil\u2019s subsidiaiy in Japan. Mehlman brought suit under the Conscientious Employee Protection Act (CEPA), <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:19-1 to -8. A jury returned a verdict in his favor and awarded him $3,440,300 in compensatory damages and $3,500,000 in punitive damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-10\">The trial judge granted Mobil\u2019s motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict on the ground that Mehlman had failed to identify a clear mandate of public policy which he reasonably believed Mobil had violated, as required by CEPA <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>34:19-3c(3). The judge was reluctant to give CEPA extraterritorial effect. Nevertheless, because the judge considered Mobil\u2019s conduct outrageous, he amended the complaint to conform to the evidence supporting a prima facie tort claim and entered judgment for Mehlman on that claim. As a result, the judge granted Mehlman only the amount of punitive damages that the jury had awarded. On this appeal, Mobil challenges the prima facie tort award and defends the dismissal of the CEPA claim as mandated by the Commerce Clause. Mehlman cross-appeals, seeking reinstatement of his CEPA award and reversal of the pretrial dismissal of his defamation claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>Mehlman\u2019s complaint alleged, among other things, that (1) Mobil had violated CEPA and wrongfully terminated his employment in violation of Mobil\u2019s regulations and the parties\u2019 employment contract, and (2) Mobil and the individual defendants had defamed him. His complaint asserted that while conferring with Mobil employees in Japan in the fall of 1989, Mehlman had warned them that they should reduce benzene levels in Mobil gasoline because the chemical, \u201cposed a serious threat to the public health and environment____\u201d Mehlman\u2019s employment was terminated immediately upon his return from Japan.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-5\">Mobil denied the material allegations of Mehlman\u2019s claims, asserting that it had terminated him for just cause, and counterclaimed that he had misappropriated Mobil\u2019s assets and funds. It also filed a third-party complaint against Princeton Scientific Publishing Co., Inc., a company owned by Mehlman\u2019s wife.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b132-6\">In March 1992, Mobil successfully moved to dismiss certain of Mehlman\u2019s non-CEPA claims against the individual defendants on the ground that they were barred by <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:19-8, which provides that a CEPA' action waives other rights and remedies. As to the remaining claims, the judge denied Mobil\u2019s subsequent motion for summary judgment, which was based upon Mehlman\u2019s failure to cite any law, regulation or clear mandate of public policy that Mobil had violated. <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>34:19-3. The case proceeded to trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-7\">We conclude that the trial judge erred in vacating the jury award on the CEPA claim. Although we reject Mobfl\u2019s due process objections to the post-trial amendment of the complaint, we agree that the prima facie tort claim is barred by the CEPA waiver provision because it was based upon the same retaliatory discharge as the CEPA claim. On the other hand, since Mehl<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>man\u2019s defamation claim was independent of his CEPA claim, the judge erred in dismissing it. Hence, for the reasons hereinafter stated, we affirm in part, reverse in part, and reinstate the jury verdict and damage awards.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-6\">\n<em>I.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b133-7\">A proper understanding of the case necessitates a somewhat lengthy discussion. Mehlman earned his Ph.D. at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1964. He served as a postdoctoral fellow at the University of Wisconsin\u2019s Institute for Enzyme Research and thereafter as an associate professor of biochemistry at Rutgers University and a professor of biochemistry at the University of Nebraska. In succession, Mehlman worked as Chief of Biochemical Toxicology for the Bureau of Foods in the U.S. Food and Drug Administration; as Special Assistant for Toxicology, Nutrition and Environmental Affairs in the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Health in the U.S. Department of Health, Education and Welfare; and, as Special Assistant and Liaison Officer for the Office of the Director of the National Institutes of Health.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-8\">In 1976, Mobil recruited Mehlman as Director of Environmental Health and Toxicology in its Medical Department. He was promoted in 1978 to Director of Toxicology and Manager of the Environmental Health and Science Laboratory in Mobil\u2019s Princeton-based Department of Environmental Affairs and Toxicology. Shortly after he became Mobil\u2019s toxicology director and laboratory manager, Mehlman reported to John McCullough, General Manager of the Mobil Toxicology Division\u2019s Environmental Affairs and Toxicology Department and Vice President of the Mobil Research and Development Corporation (MRDC).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In his new capacity, Mehlman established a laboratory, which began operating around <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>1980 or 1981 with a staff of over 100 people. Between 1981 and 1985, Mehlman\u2019s level of responsibility had increased so as to give him full authority in all of his job tasks except assisting other departments. Mehlman\u2019s duties included representing Mobil on toxicology matters and providing \u201ctoxicologic[al] and regulatory advice for prudent business decisions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b134-4\">Mehlman\u2019s curriculum vitae includes some 200 books and articles written and published in the fields of toxicology and biomedical science. He authored various articles on benzene and chaired several symposia on the harmful effects of gasoline vapors. In addition, Mehlman helped to found the American College of Toxicology, of which he served as president, and the Collegium Ramazzini, of which he served as an officer and a director. He has belonged to many professional societies, enjoying numerous editorial appointments, professional committee assignments, and symposia chairmanships.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-5\">According to Mehlman\u2019s 1988 job description, the laboratory that he managed \u201cha[d] full responsibility for toxicology testing for Mobil Corporation____\u201d As the only one performing toxicological testing for Mobil\u2019s affiliates, Mehlman\u2019s laboratory received praise from Mobil\u2019s senior managers as well as outside scientists. The key speaker at a 1986 Clean Air Conference described it as \u201cmagnificent.\u201d In April 1987, D\u2019Ambrisi thanked Mehlman for the \u201cpositive overtones\u201d of a magazine article written about the laboratory. The record reflects that Mehlman\u2019s job performance appraisals were excellent, including one given just five months before he was terminated. Based upon his performance, Mehlman received annual merit raises and stock options from Mobil.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In addition, Mobil\u2019s vice president of research nominated him to the National Academy of Sciences in May 1989. The nomination described Mehlman as \u201can international expert in toxicology [who] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>is often consulted on issues involving the toxicity of chemicals in relation to environmental health.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b135-6\">The genesis of the present controversy was Mehlman\u2019s participation in the organization of the First Pacific Cooperative Symposium, \u201cIndustrialization and Emerging Environmental Health Issues \u2014 Risk Assessment and Risk Management,\u201d held in 1989 at the University of Japan. Mehlman explained that the symposium could have impacted upon company business in Japan, which Mobil transacted through its wholly-owned affiliate, Mobil Sekiyu Kabushiki Kaisha (MSKK), because Japanese regulatory people were expected to attend and speak. When Silvestri approved Mehlman\u2019s attendance, Mobil\u2019s International Administration arranged for him to discuss toxicology and environmental health issues at MSKK during his visit to Japan.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-7\">On September 27,1989, Mehlman met with MSKK management at Mobil headquarters in Tokyo and gave a slide presentation on the health effects of gasoline. One slide showed the concentration of benzene in gasoline in the United States, Japan, and Europe. When Mehlman finished his presentation, MSKK Technical Manager Takashi Tsunemori asked to see this slide again. Tsunemori informed Mehlman that he had inaccurately reported Japanese benzene levels at 2.5% to 3.5% for regular gasoline and 2.5% to 4.6% for premium gasoline. According to Mehlman, Tsunemori informed him that the benzene level in Japanese gasoline was 5.7% or 5.8%.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-8\">Mehlman testified that he told Tsunemori that benzene was \u201ca very poisonous chemical \u2014 dangerous and toxic. And [these] concentrations are too high. [T]hey have to be reduced.\u201d Mehlman asked Tsunemori whether the Japanese regulatory agency was aware of these benzene levels. Tsunemori allegedly responded, \u201cWe do not have to tell them.\u201d Mehlman contends that he reiterated that \u201cthis is much too dangerous and you must reduce it\u201d and that Tsunemori answered that the levels could not be reduced because of old equipment that would cost \u201cseveral hundred million dollars to change [a] single refinery to produce a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>product with low levels of benzene.\u201d Mehlman advised Tsunemori to \u201creduce it or do not sell it,\u201d which left those in attendance \u201cshocked and surprised.\u201d At trial, Tsunemori recalled attending Mehlman\u2019s slide presentation, but denied having told him that the benzene level of regular gasoline sold by MSKK was 5.7% or 5.8%.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-4\">John Drummond, of Mobil Oil International, explained that MSKK had purchased its gasoline from at least three different refineries, the one in question being the Chiba refinery.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Tsunemori produced monthly test reports for that refinery from May 1988 through December 1989, showing the monthly volume percentage of benzene produced in that period. From May 1988 through April 1989, the monthly benzene levels were between 4.5% and 4.7%.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The level from May 1989 through September 1989 was 4.5%. On cross-examination, Tsunemori admitted that these batch reports showed only the \u201ctypical\u201d benzene levels for each month without showing their actual range.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-5\">Mehlman explained that hydrocarbons, including benzene, vaporize from gasoline mixtures into the air and condense into liquid form that contaminates other water sources. He noted that benzene also reaches water sources through gasoline spills. Based upon an article published in 1988 by a foremost epidemiologist, Mehlman testified that human exposure to mixtures contain: ing benzene, a carcinogen, causes myelogenous leukemia. He referred to a Consumer Product Safety Commission regulation, amended in 1988, which provided that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b136-6\">Because inhalation of the vapors of products containing 5 percent or more by weight of benzene may cause blood dyscrasias, such products shall be labeled with the signal word \u201cdanger,\u201d the statement of hazard \u201cVapor harmful,\u201d the word \u201cpoison,\u201d and the skull and crossbones symbol____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b136-8\">[16 <em>C.F.R. </em>\u00a7 1500.14(b)(3)(i)].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b137-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>Mehlman indicated that MSKK had no warnings on its gasoline in 1989, however, despite the fact that blood dyscrasia, the disturbance of normal blood cells, leads to various diseases including leukemia. He stated that the United States had imposed controls, such as catalytic converters in automobiles and vapor containment systems for the transportation of gasoline, which Japan had not yet adopted. In fact, he noted that the Occupational Safety and Health Administration had enacted a regulation in 1987, which had reduced permissible benzene exposure in the workplace from ten parts per million to one part per million.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-6\">Citing his job responsibility to monitor the toxicity of his employer\u2019s products, Mehlman testified that he believed that New Jersey law prohibited MSKK from marketing gasoline with benzene levels over 5%. He felt that \u201cmany people would die from this ... unnecessary overexposure, because we knew how to correct it.\u201d Mehlman also feared the impact of product liability acknowledged in a February 1987 draft paper forwarded by McCullough to D\u2019Ambrisi on \u201cPotential Health Effects of Gasoline \u2014 An Update.\u201d The paper concluded that \u201c[t]he greatest potential, and unestimable, cost of a governmental finding that exposure to gasoline causes cancer in humans would arise from personal damage claims.\u201d Mehlman was additionally concerned about his own possible professional negligence in the event that he faded to inform Mobil of the benzene risk.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b137-7\">Mehlman also referred to an April 1977 interoffice memo about benzene sent to the president of Mobil Marketing and Refining. The memo recalled how benzene \u201chas been considered toxic,\u201d possibly carcinogenic, and that containers with 5% or more ben<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>zene were required to have a \u201cpoison\u201d label as a result. The memo warned that reduction of the benzene level in Mobil\u2019s gasoline and other products could cost Mobil hundreds of millions of dollars.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-4\">In August 1983, McCullough had sent then MRDC President J.E. Penick a memo enclosing a background paper on benzene, which similarly stated that \u201c[m]ajor investment would be required to reduce the benzene content below one percent, especially overseas.\u201d The paper indicated that \u201c[hjealth and safety requirements in the future will not differ much wherever we operate.\u201d Accordingly, Mobil had pledged in its \u201cPolicy on Product Safety Stewardship\u201d that \u201c[i]n the absence of adequate local government requirements, Mobil affiliates will maintain standards of safety and health protection that consider scientific knowledge and established practices in developed countries.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b138-5\">Mehlman asserted that the \u201cJapanese [have] usually copped] American regulation,\u201d such as by removing lead from gasoline and using seat belts. He thus \u201cnaturally assumed that they would follow the same regulation with respect to benzene because they\u2019re very quick in accepting certain standards to protect their population----\u201d At trial, he referenced a 1974 Japanese Environment Agency Notification regarding benzene in drinking water.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Mehlman admitted, however, that he was unaware of this specific regulation when he spoke in Japan in 1989. Even so, Drummond stated that the Japanese Petroleum Association, which \u201clooks after ... the interests of the oil industry members operating in Japan,\u201d had voluntary guidelines establishing 5% as the maximum benzene content of gasoline during 1988 and 1989. MSKK was a member of the Japanese Petroleum Association and, according to Tsunemori, was obligated to obey its guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>After Ms meeting at MSKK, MeMman attended the First Pacific Cooperative Symposium from October 1 to October 5,1989. During his presentation, Mehlman showed the same benzene slide, commenting that the levels were between 3.5% and 5% in Japanese gasoline. Mehlman refrained from objecting to the Mgh levels of benzene at the conference because he had not yet had an opportumty to speak to his superiors. He was \u201cvery concerned\u201d about people being injured and \u201creally astomshed that knowing what we know today, that these levels existed in Mobil\u2019s gasoline.\u201d MeMman intended to raise the issue with Mobil as soon as he returned from Japan.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-6\">MeMman arrived home from Japan late in the evemng of Friday, October 6, 1989, to learn that Silvestri had called. When Mehlman returned his call the following mormng, Silvestri informed him that Mobil had received information about a possible conflict of interest on Mehlman\u2019s part involving his wife\u2019s publishing company, which had prompted an mvestigation that necessitated placing him on \u201cspecial assignment indefimtely.\u201d His home became Ms work place as Ms access to Mobil\u2019s premises was restricted. Silvestri also asked Mehlman not to \u201ccall anyone at the lab\u201d and would not allow Mehlman to respond. Silvestri corroborated Mehlman\u2019s version of this conversation.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-7\">In May 1989, Mobil had retained Kymn and Company, a management consulting firm owned by Kymn Rutigliano, to improve employee commumcations within the lab. In the course of interviewing employees, Rutigliano had heard allegations that Mehlman was misusing Mobil's assets for his personal gain. According to Rutigliano, she called Silvestri on September 20 or 21, who asked her to deliver a report on tMs matter to him by September 28. Silvestri confirmed the accuracy of this conversation, saying he wanted the report quickly because \u201cI thought I had a hot potato in my hands and I wanted to pass that potato to my boss [D\u2019Ambrisi] as quicMy as possible.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b139-8\">Rutigliano reported that employees had accused Mehlman of using Mobil\u2019s personnel and supplies, including postage, for his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>publishing business; of hiring consultants for his personal lawsuits at Mob\u00fc\u2019s expense; of obtaining Mobil grants for his publishing patrons; and, of promoting only employees who agreed to assist with publishing activity on company time. She also stated that several individuals had attempted to alert senior management to these problems, but were unsuccessful in doing so. Rutigliano recommended an internal security investigation, a possible reorganization, removal of Mehlman from the laboratory, and counselling for his staff. She conceded that \u201c[g]iven this can be viewed as a grey area since technical publishing and related activities can benefit Mobil, I urge you to be rigorous in drawing the line as to what is acceptable and what is not.\u201d Rutigliano was surprised by how fast Silvestri left his office to deliver her report to D\u2019Ambrisi in light of the lack of success experienced by others who had tried to bring this issue to Mobil\u2019s attention.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-4\">When D\u2019Ambrisi received Rutigliano\u2019s report, he immediately authorized an internal investigation into the accusations against Mehlman. D\u2019Ambrisi, Silvestri, MRDC General Counsel John Blay, MRDC Personnel Manager Robert Meyer, and MRDC Security Manager Paul Geneas met on September 29 to review Rutigliano\u2019s report. Blay indicated that those in attendance thought that Mehlman had been \u201cperhaps wrongfully\u201d accused and wanted to proceed quickly to \u201cclear it up\u201d before Mehlman returned from Japan so that his work at the laboratory could continue. He stated that there had been no discussion of the nature of Mehlman\u2019s presentations in Japan. By the time Mehlman was due back from Japan, however, the investigation, conducted by Geneas, had produced substantial material against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-5\">Silvestri later asked McCullough whether he had authorized Mehlman \u201cto use Mobil assets for the benefit of Princeton Scientific,\u201d to which McCullough answered that he had not. When Silvestri relayed this information to D\u2019Ambrisi, they agreed to read Mehlman the written statement that Silvestri had prepared. Silvestri denied that anyone had told him or D\u2019Ambrisi of Mehlman\u2019s remarks to the MSKK managers at the time that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>supervisors decided to place him on special assignment. They hoped to avoid embarrassing him and to expedite the investigation then underway.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-5\">On October 12, Silvestri met with Mehlman and personnel employee Gary Habla to review the allegations and to give Mehlman an opportunity to respond. Silvestri told Mehlman that he was accused of relying on his subordinates to examine papers for Princeton Scientific; employing Mobil\u2019s mail system to send out Princeton Scientific books and documents; spending Mobil\u2019s petty cash on stamps for Princeton Scientific; utilizing the services of Mobil\u2019s personnel for Princeton Scientific; using Mobfl\u2019s materials and graphics equipment for brochures for Princeton Scientific; paying honoraria to laboratory visitors when they provided services for Princeton Scientific; providing Mobil grants to people who were doing things for Mehlman; and, submitting irregular travel and entertaining expense account forms. Mehlman denied some of the allegations and had no comment on others. Mehlman was neither given a written copy of the Rutigliano report nor allowed access to the laboratory to obtain records pertinent to the investigation. Instead, another meeting was scheduled for October 24 to afford Mehlman, with his attorney present, an opportunity to tell his \u201cside of the story.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b141-6\">On or about October 16, Geneas finished his interviews of Rutigliano, McCullough, and fifteen employees supervised by Mehlman. On October 19 or 20, Silvestri convened a meeting with D\u2019Ambrisi, Blay, Meyer, and Geneas, at which he recommended that Mehlman be relieved as manager of the laboratory because \u201che had abused the trust that we would put into him in that position.\u201d D\u2019Ambrisi decided that Mehlman would be offered two choices: either make restitution and resign or be terminated for cause. An October 20 memo from D\u2019Ambrisi to Mobil President Robert Tucker accused Mehlman of misconduct and concluded that \u201cwe have no recourse but to sever Mr. Mehlman\u2019s relationship with Mobil.\u201d Blay and Silvestri recalled, however, that D\u2019Ambrisi had agreed to take no final action until Mehlman was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>given an opportunity to explain himself on October 24. Nevertheless, Mehlman canceled the meeting on the morning of October 24 and, through counsel, declined to reschedule it. Geneas considered an interview with the accused \u201cabsolutely critical\u201d and represented that he would have included Mehlman\u2019s comments in his report. Geneas maintained that he had planned to provide Mehlman with a copy of his report at the October 24 meeting.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-4\">According to an October 24 \u201cInvestigative Inquiry\u201d prepared by Geneas, Mehlman had utilized Mobil personnel and resources to run his wife\u2019s publishing business. Acknowledging that the endeavor had operated at a loss, the report noted that it had nonetheless enhanced Mehlman\u2019s \u201cpersonal prestige.\u201d Although Mehlman had agreed to terminate his publishing activity in 1985, he allegedly had failed to do so. Highlights of the report included defendant K.A. Tortoriello, Mehlman\u2019s Executive Secretary, describing him as a \u201ccrook,\u201d and defendant Carl Mackerer, Mobil\u2019s Manager of Toxicology Services, accusing him of spending most of his time on his publishing business and of ignoring the laboratory.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-5\">On cross-examination, Geneas admitted that he had omitted several exculpatory statements from his report. Mehlman produced checks given to a Mobil employee, which refuted her reported accusation that Mobil had paid her for working for Princeton Scientific. McCullough acknowledged that Princeton Scientific Publishing Company had not interfered with Mehlman\u2019s job performance and conceded that the issue had never been mentioned on his annual performance appraisals.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-6\">D\u2019Ambrisi asserted that he made the final decision to terminate Mehlman in late October 1989. He claimed to have had no knowledge of Mehlman\u2019s remarks to MSKK representatives at the time he decided to fire him. As a result, D\u2019Ambrisi told Silvestri to meet with and terminate Mehlman unless he provided documentation authorizing his use of Mobil's assets for the benefit of Princeton Scientific. Silvestri met with and terminated Mehlman on November 2 after he made no attempt to defend himself. On November 8, Silvestri wrote to Mehlman terminating his employ<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>ment for cause as of the date of their meeting. Mobil never provided Mehlman with any written reports or evidence against him until he filed suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-6\">Denying that he had made Princeton Scientific mailings at Mobil\u2019s expense, Mehlman explained that he frequently did mailings on behalf of professional organizations, whose meetings Mobil had paid him to attend on its behalf. Mehlman asserted that he had discussed his activities in these organizations with his supervisors.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-7\">Mehlman testified that Mobil had agreed when it offered him employment in 1976 to his continuing as editor of the Journal of Environmental Health and of the Journal of Toxicology as well as to his completion of several books. One of Mehlman\u2019s job tasks was \u201c[e]stablish[ing a] high degree of credibility and reputation for Mobil worldwide in areas of toxicology and environmental health.\u201d According to Mehlman, this was accomplished by publishing, which enhanced his reputation and enabled him to deal on behalf of Mobil more effectively with regulatory agencies. In fact, several employees of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency served as editors of Princeton Scientific publications. As a result, Mehlman noted that he was rated as clearly exceeding his job requirements in maintaining connections with government agencies, academia, and industry scientists.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-8\">Mehlman admitted that he had occasionally used Mobil\u2019s resources for Princeton Scientific, contending that he did so \u201cwhen [he] thought it [would be] beneficial to Mobil\u201d and with McCullough\u2019s knowledge and consent.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Mehlman pointed out that Mobil <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>had neither warned him that he should refrain from using its resources for publishing nor had criticized him for failing to do so. Even though Mehlman spoke to Silvestri at least every other day, Silvestri had never mentioned these concerns before Mehlman\u2019s 1989 trip to Japan. In Mehlman\u2019s view, there was no clear demarcation between work performed for Mobil and Princeton Scientific by Mobil employees because Mobil research papers were sometimes published in Princeton Scientific journals. He speculated that employees might have surmised from this that they were working for the publishing company when they were in fact working for Mobil.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-4\">At trial, Mehlman offered a 1980 memo from Mobil\u2019s Committee on Conflicts of Interest, which he had received following its review of his situation. The committee had concluded that Mehlman could continue publication of a professional journal and 50% ownership in the publishing company he then owned. Referring to \u201cstanding rulings\u201d allowing publication of technical papers and. management-approved outside teaching, the committee instructed Mehlman and his supervisors of their \u201cmutual obligation\u201d to comply with these directives, \u201cparticularly to insuring that no misuse of company information or facilities [would be] involved and the activities [did] not interfere] with the efficient performance of the employee\u2019s duties.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b144-5\">In October 1984, Mehlman submitted to McCullough a memo requesting a review of a possible conflict of interest based upon his own prior interest in various publishing companies. He attached lists of books and other publications with which he had been involved. In a responding \u201cmemo to file,\u201d a copy of which went to the MRDC President, McCullough concluded that Mehlman\u2019s publishing activity detracted from his job performance at Mobil even though no conflict of interest appeared to exist. Consequently, Mehlman agreed to divest himself of his publishing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>activity by the end of 1985. Mehlman explained that he had attempted to sell Princeton Scientific to over 100 different publishers, but couldn\u2019t even give it away to Princeton University. Mehlman insisted that he had kept McCullough informed of his efforts to dispose Princeton Scientific verbally every month and in writing three or four times per year. McCullough claimed to have been unaware, however, of the fact that Princeton Scientific\u2019s business had increased after Mehlman had promised to divest himself of it by the end of 1985. Yet, D\u2019Ambrisi also admitted that he was aware that Mehlman had been unable to sell his publishing business.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-6\">Mehlman said that he felt shocked and confused after being suspended and locked out of his laboratory. From October 7 to November 2, 1989, he was anxious, worried, ashamed, and unable to sleep. He had three daughters in college, a wife in professional school, and a mortgage to pay. Following his termination, Mehlman testified that he felt sick and horrible, stopped attending professional meetings, even of organizations he had founded and had previously enjoyed, and even avoided going into Princeton because of his embarrassment. Mehlman had worked long hours, including almost every weekend, to build his laboratory\u2019s national and international reputation. He was immensely proud of it. As a result, he compared losing his laboratory to \u201closing a child.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b145-7\">Mehlman produced an economist who appraised Mehlman\u2019s past wage losses for the period of 1990 to 1994 at $524,974, the value of what he would have earned from Mobil less what he had actually earned. Mehlman\u2019s future wage losses between 1994 and his proposed retirement in six years at age sixty-five were calculated to be $132,000 per year. Mehlman\u2019s loss of pension and stock options, both reduced to present value, were set at $373,326 and $105,000, respectively.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-8\">The juiy found that Mehlman had proved \u201cthat he objected to any activity, policy or practice that he reasonably believed was incompatible with a clear mandate of public policy concerning the public health, safety or welfare,\u201d and that Mobil had retaliated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>against him for doing so. As a result, it awarded him $2,565,800 for his financial loss and $875,000 for his emotional distress. Upon further finding that Mehlman was entitled to punitive damages, the jury also awarded him $3,500,000 after the parties had stipulated Mobil\u2019s net worth to be $11,986,000,000 and its gross revenue in the past twelve months to be $60,522,000,000. Although Mobil \u201chad a policy that prohibited termination except for good cause,\u201d the jury decided that Mobil had not violated that policy. After the jury returned its verdict, the judge indicated that he might set it aside because CEPA did not appear to him to apply to a statement made in Japan. The judge also advised that he might amend the complaint to conform to the evidence as supporting a \u201cprima facie tort.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b146-4\">Mobil moved for judgment notwithstanding the verdict, reasserting its mandate of public policy argument. Mehlman cross-moved, contending that the complaint should be amended to conform to the proofs. The judge set aside the verdict as not based upon a clear mandate of New Jersey public policy that Mehlman reasonably believed Mobil to have violated. Nevertheless, the judge decided that the punitive damages award was justified. He granted Mobil\u2019s motion and entered final judgment in its favor on September 14,1994, on the counts in the complaint as previously awarded. Pursuant to <em>R. </em>4:9-2, however, the judge also ordered <em>-sua sponte </em>that the complaint be amended \u201cto include a claim in <em>prima facie </em>tort in favor of Mehlman and against Mobil for punitive damages in the amount of $3,500,000____\u201d Mobil\u2019s counterclaim against Mehlman and its third-party complaint against Princeton Scientific Publishing Co. were dismissed. Enforcement of the judgment was stayed pending appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-7\">\n<em>II.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b146-8\">In order to explicate our decision in a more logical fashion, we deal first with Mehlman\u2019s cross-appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>A</p>\n<p id=\"b147-6\">Mehlman argues that he has identified several clear, relevant mandates of public policy applicable to Mobil\u2019s conduct.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> He contends, therefore, that the trial judge erred in ruling to the contrary.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b147-7\">The trial judge opined that \u201cwhile environmental protection is humanitarily correct, our legislature did not contemplate incorporating the biblical golden rule into its statute.\u201d He had previously referred to the \u201camorphus concept of thou shalt not kill earthlings with benz[e]ne____\u201d The judge asserted that New Jersey employers should be able \u201cto ascertain a bright line\u201d regarding a clear mandate of public policy and should not be required \u201c[t]o consult the [Bjible and Collegium Ramazzmi and Hippocratic oath in order to ascertain what they should do in connection with statements made by their employees----\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b147-9\">The judge also thought that a clear mandate of New Jersey policy should \u201cactually affect New Jersey citizens,\u201d but that \u201c[t]he impact of 5 percent benzene is, at best, remote and conjectural\u201d because \u201cNew Jersey is on the other side of the world from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>Japan,\u201d thus making the impact of excessive benzene \u201cat best, remote and conjectural.\u201d He indicated that Japan, a \u201csophisticated society,\u201d could make its own environmental laws and regulations. In enacting CEPA, the judge reasoned, the Legislature had not intended to \u201cimpose upon its corporations here in New Jersey an obligation to adhere to the highest forms of environmentally protective conduct.\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b148-4\">I still don\u2019t see why we should say to our companies competing on an international level, we\u2019re going to tie your hands behind your back, it\u2019s okay for Japanese companies selling gas to go beyond the 5.0 percent, but we\u2019re not going to let Mobil or Esso do that.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b148-5\">In deciding Mobil\u2019s motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict under <em>R. </em>4:40-2, the trial judge was required to determine whether the evidence, together with the legitimate inferences therefrom, could sustain a judgment in favor of Mehlman. <em>Dolson v. Anastasia, </em>55 <em>N.J. </em>2, 5, 258 A.2d 706 (1969). The evidence supporting Mehlman\u2019s position had to be accepted as true, and Mehlman should have been accorded the benefit of all inferences which could reasonably have been drawn from the evidence. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b148-6\">Mobil contends that the mandate of public policy required by N.J.S.A. 34:19-3c(3) must be clear and specific to the employer\u2019s conduct, so that the defendant-employer has \u201creasonable notice of when it is prohibited from terminating an employee.\u201d Mobil further urges that this mandate must be the basis of Mehlman\u2019s objection to its conduct when the objection is made. Finally, Mobil maintains that the clear mandate of public policy must have an intended and permissible extraterritorial effect, which CEPA did not possess.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-7\">Mobil relies upon <em>Abbamont v. Piscataway Tp. Bd. of Educ., </em>138 <em>N.J. </em>405, 650 A.2d 958 (1994), and <em>Pierce v. Ortho Pharmaceutical Corp., </em>84 <em>N.J. </em>58, 417 A.2d 505 (1980). In <em>Abbamont, supra, </em>138 <em>N.J. </em>at 410, 650 A.2d 958, a non-tenured industrial arts teacher claimed that his employer had retaliated against him by denying him re-employment because he had complained about inadequate ventilation in his workshop. The Court found that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>regulations respecting ventilation in industrial arts programs, which were incorporated into the school board\u2019s \u201cofficial safety guide,\u201d \u201cdirectly and specifically addressed matters of health and safety and fully reflected a mandate of public policy relating to general concerns of health, safety and environmental protection.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 424, 650 A.2d 958. Moreover, the Court determined that the plaintiff had shown \u201ca reasonable, objective belief\u2019 that school officials had specifically violated these regulations, thereby rendering their conduct \u201cincompatible\u201d with a public policy mandate. <em>Ibid. </em>Although its opinion dealt primarily with the liability of the school board for the actions of its officials and the availability of punitive damages, the Court also decided that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AAB\">plaintiffs complaints were, as required under CEPA, based on a reasonable belief that the conditions in the metal shop were in violation of an administrative \u201cregulation promulgated pursuant to law\u201d and were contrary to \u201ca clear mandate of public policy concerning the public health, safety or welfare or protection of the environment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b149-6\">[Id. at 423, 650 A.2d 958].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b149-7\"><em>Abbamont </em>did not read N.J.S.A. 34:19-3c as requiring actual knowledge of a specific legal mandate.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Even though the specific legal mandate in <em>Abbamont </em>also constituted a pubic polcy, the Court did not comment upon whether Abbamont was aware of the applicable regulation at the time that he made his objections known. Abbamont knew there had to be regulation of air qualty and ventilation in a school shop when he \u201cexpressed concern about the poor health and safety conditions of the metal shop, including <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>... lack of air ventilation____\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 410, 650 A.2d 958. He apparently was unable, however, to cite the specific regulation. Nevertheless, his belief that there had been a violation was both reasonable and objective. <em>Id. </em>at 424, 650 A.2d 958.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-5\">Mobil maintains that an employee must have a \u201cparticular reason for objecting\u201d lest CEPA becomes an \u201cinvitation\u201d for plaintiffs lawyers \u201cendlessly to search the law libraries\u201d for mandates of which a plaintiff had never heard but might now assert reliance. According to Mobil, the clear mandate of public policy \u201cmust exist,\u201d Mehlman \u201cmust have believed it existed,\u201d and \u201cthat belief must have been reasonable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b150-6\">This is precisely what occurred here. The clear mandate of public policy derived from federal regulations and New Jersey product liability law was effective in Japan through the operation of the Japanese Petroleum Association guideline and the Japanese Environmental Agency Notification. Although Mehlman was not specifically aware of either of these sources when he voiced his objection in Japan in September 1989, he nonetheless reasonably believed that such clear mandates existed. Mehlman offered examples at trial of how the \u201cJapanese usually copy American regulation,\u201d thereby demonstrating a basis upon which he had \u201cnaturally assumed that they would follow the same regulation with respect to benzene----\u201d The Japanese Petroleum Association guideline was thus, as Mehlman describes, \u201can objective referent which evidences the reasonableness of his belief.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b150-8\">Mobil concedes that CEPA \u201cdoes not require a plaintiff to know, to a legal certitude, the precise contours and components of the public policy.\u201d Just as the plaintiff in <em>Abbamont </em>knew without citing to the New Jersey Administrative Code that the State regulates air quality and ventilation in public school workshops, Mehlman appreciated that there had to be Japanese regulation of benzene content in gasoline which parallelled regulations promulgated in the United States. We reject, therefore, Mobil\u2019s argument that Mehlman\u2019s inability to cite a precise regulation is fatal to his case.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>Mobil argues that the Japanese Petroleum Association guideline was not binding. Mobil\u2019s own witness, MSKK Technical Service Manager Takashi Tsunemori, testified that his boss was responsible for compliance with the Japanese Petroleum Association guideline. Mehlman was entitled to the benefit of this favorable evidence in defending against Mobil\u2019s motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-6\">Likewise, Mobil\u2019s contention that there was no violation of the Japanese Petroleum Association guideline because benzene levels were under 5% is without merit. There was testimony that Tsunemori had informed Mehlman that the benzene levels in Japanese gasoline were 5.7% or 5.8%. Mobil also dismisses the Japanese Environmental Agency Notification because it regulates water but not gasoline. Mehlman explained, however, that gasoline vapors escape into the air during transport, return in rainfall, and concentrate in water. In uncontroverted testimony, Mehlman observed that Japan, unlike the United States, has not attempted to control this process through the use of catalytic converters. Mehlman\u2019s connection between benzene contamination and ground water was thus sound. Mehlman is again entitled to the benefit of his own favorable testimony on these points.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-7\">Mobil is mistaken that the clear mandate of public policy must prohibit the specific conduct of the employer in question. <em>See, e.g., Hennessey v. Coastal Eagle Point Oil Co., </em>129 <em>N.J. </em>81, 98-99, 609 A.2d 11 (1992) (private employee\u2019s right to privacy may serve as predicate of clear mandate of public policy undergirding wrongful discharge claim). The statute requires the employee to have reasonably believed that the employer\u2019s conduct had <em>either </em>violated a law, rule or regulation, <em>or </em>had been incompatible with a clear mandate of public policy. N.J.S.A. 34:19-3c. The <em>sine qua nan </em>of a CEPA claim is not the actual occurrence of a violation of promulgated authority or public policy, but rather the existence of a reasonable belief to the effect that such authority or policy has been breached. <em>D\u2019Agostino v. Johnson &amp; Johnson, Inc., </em>133 <em>N.J. </em>516, 542, 628 A.2d 305 (1993); <em>see Delran Educ. Ass\u2019n v. Delran </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number><em>Bd. of Educ., </em>277 <em>N.J.Super. </em>538, 543-544, 650 A.2d 7 (App.Div.1994) (regulation governing access to teacher\u2019s pupil records was sufficient basis to afford her reasonable belief that compliance with superintendent\u2019s order would constitute violation of regulation for purpose of CEPA claim). If the Legislature had intended that a plaintiff be required to cite a specific, applicable law, rule or regulation, then there would have been no need for the \u201cclear mandate of public policy\u201d provision'of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:19-3c(3). To impose a \u201cspecific conduct\u201d requirement would eviscerate this provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-4\">Nor does <em>Pierce v. Ortho Pharmaceutical Corp., supra, </em>84 <em>N.J. </em>58, 417 A.2d 505, support Mobil\u2019s position.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> A medical doctor employed to research therapeutic drugs, Pierce was terminated after refusing to work with a drug because it contained saccharin, which she thought might be harmful. <em>Id. </em>at 62-64, 417 A.2d 505. For the first time, the Court recognized a cause of action for employees wrongfully discharged from gainful employment \u201cwhen the discharge is contrary to a clear mandate of public policy.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 72, 417 A.2d 505. In denying Pierce relief based upon her reliance on her Hippocratic oath, the Court emphasized that she <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>had contended only that saccharin was controversial, not that it would harm anyone. <em>Id. </em>at 74, 75, 417 A.2d 505. The parties\u2019 dispute thus amounted only to \u201ca difference in medical opinions.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 75, 417 A.2d 505.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-6\">In contrast, there was no controversy here regarding the toxicity of benzene. Mehlman\u2019s uncontradicted testimony was that benzene levels in gasoline of 5.7% or 5.8% had to be reduced for safety and health reasons given the \u2018Very poisonous,\u201d \u201cdangerous,\u201d and \u201ctoxic\u201d nature of the chemical. Obviously, Mehlman was correct. <em>See </em>16 <em>C.F.R. </em>\u00a7 1500.14(b)(3)(i); <em>see also Mason v. Texaco, Inc., </em>741 <em>F.Supp. </em>1472, 1482 (D.Kan.1990) (identifying the link, revealed through scientific research, between benzene exposure and leukemia, among other cancers of the blood), <em>aff'd in part and remanded, </em>948 F.2d 1546 (10th Cir.1991), <em>cert. denied, </em>504 <em>U.S. </em>910, 112 <em>S.Ct. </em>1941, 118 L.Ed.2d 547 (1992). Mobil itself recognized in a 1977 interoffice memo that benzene was toxic. There can be no question but that the conduct to which Mehlman objected could have directly harmed many people as a result of \u201cunnecessary overexposure.\u201d While the plaintiff in <em>Pierce </em>was raising an internal controversy, Mehlman was attempting to preserve health and save lives. Mobil mischaracterizes Mehlman\u2019s act as the mere \u201ccall of conscience\u201d rejected by the <em>Pierce </em>Court. <em>See Pierce v. Ortho Pharmaceutical Corp., supra, </em>84 <em>N.J. </em>at 75, 417 A.2d 505.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-7\">In addition, <em>Pierce </em>noted the plaintiffs failure to allege either a violation of a statutory regulation or an ethical principle or any possible exposure to malpractice as the result of her involvement in her employer\u2019s drug research. <em>Id. </em>at 64, 417 A.2d 505. Mehlman has shown here, on the other hand, that MSKK\u2019s excessive benzene levels violated the Japanese Petroleum Association guideline and would have violated a federal regulation in this country because of the absence of required warnings on MSKK gasoline. <em>See </em>16 <em>C.F.R. </em>\u00a7 1500.14(b)(3)(i). Mehlman also expressed concern about his possible professional negligence arising from his wilful <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>disregard of the hazard that benzene exposure poses to the consuming public.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-4\">We agree with Mobil that the <em>Pierce </em>Court refused to consider any mandates of public policy that the plaintiff there had neither alleged in her complaint nor relied upon in defense of the employer\u2019s motion to dismiss her claim. <em>See Pierce v. Ortho Pharmaceutical Corp., supra, </em>84 <em>N.J. </em>at 75, 417 A.2d 505. Mehlman contends that he did raise all of his alleged \u201cmandates\u201d either at trial or in his post-trial submissions. We will not entertain sources of public policy identified for the first time after trial, however, inasmuch as a verdict, dependent upon the finding by a jury of a reasonable belief, cannot be upheld on the basis of post-hoc rationalization.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b154-5\">Notwithstanding this limitation, Mehlman testified that he was aware of the aforementioned federal regulation when he made his comments in Tokyo in September 1989. Although Mehlman could not cite any specific Japanese law or regulation, as noted earlier, he \u201cnaturally assumed\u201d that the Japanese had in effect standards rivaling those established in the United States. Mehlman knew that Mobil had promulgated its own \u201cPolicy on Product Safety Stewardship,\u201d which pledged its adherence to safety standards established in the developed world. Japan is clearly a developed nation. As we read the policy, however, the purview of Mobil\u2019s pledge extends not only to undeveloped countries, but to nations lacking local standards as well. Due to the fact that the Japanese government had not yet approved limits on benzene levels in gasoline as of 1989, Mobil had obligated itself through its own policy to utilize in Japan established standards of safety and health protection.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>Mehlman has also explicated potential product liability and professional negligence consequences that could have ensued from his failure to act. He relies upon the comment in <em>Soler v. Castmaster, Div. of H.P.M. Corp., </em>98 <em>N.J. </em>137, 145, 484 A.2d 1225 (1984), that \u201c \u2018only safe products should be marketed.\u2019 \u201d In addition, he emphasizes that a distributor of harmful products has a duty to adequately warn unsuspecting consumers of the risk of such harm. <em>See Macrie v. SDS Biotech Corp., </em>267 <em>N.J.Super. </em>34, 41, 630 A.2d 805 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied and appeal dismissed, </em>134 <em>N.J. </em>565, 636 A.2d 522 (1993). Mobil counters that product liability law is too general and was not intended to have extraterritorial effect. Our Supreme Court has implied, however, that professional liability may be a relevant consideration in ascertaining a clear mandate of public policy. <em>See Pierce v. Ortho Pharmaceutical Corp., supra, </em>84 <em>N.J. </em>at 75, 417 A.2d 505. Mobil\u2019s internal 1987 memo, \u201cPotential Health Effects of Gasoline \u2014 An Update,\u201d warned of the cost that \u201cpersonal damage claims\u201d arising from cancer caused by gasoline exposure would exact on Mobil. Even if Mehlman had remained silent, Mobil might nonetheless have been held liable under Japanese law for selling a harmful product. By speaking out, Mehlman sought to defend against the possibility of product liability and of his own professional negligence arising from his failure to prevent benzene exposure. These were reasonable public policy considerations when Mehlman voiced his objection in Tokyo in September 1989.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-6\">Although excluded from evidence, the Society of Toxicology\u2019s Code of Ethics also bolsters Mehlman\u2019s CEPA claim as a professional code that serves both professional and public interests.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> <em>See id. </em>at 72, 417 A.2d 505 (recognizing that \u201cprofessional code of ethics may contain an expression of public policy\u201d unless it \u201cserve[s] only the interest of a profession\u201d). Mobil criticizes the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>Code of Ethics as too vague and charges that Mehlman did not act in a \u201cresponsible manner\u201d because he had ordered a reduction in benzene levels without verifying the figures he claimed to have received from Tsunemori. Mehlman responds that he could not investigate them because Mobil had barred him from his work and his laboratory. We agree with Mehlman that his actions were responsible under the circumstances. He did not communicate any information outside of the company, intending to bring the matter to the attention of his superiors as soon as possible. There was no evidence that Mehlman was authorized to stop MSKK sales or that MSKK had ceased its gasoline sales in response to Mehlman\u2019s warning. We conclude that Mehlman \u201cwas not motivated by his personal values or conscience, but rather by his perception of his professional obligations.\u201d <em>Kalman v. The Grand Union Co., </em>188 <em>N.J.Super. </em>158, 157, 443 A.2d 728 (App.Div.1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b156-4\">Mobil cites <em>D\u2019Agostino v. Johnson &amp; Johnson, Inc., supra, </em>133 <em>N.J. </em>516, 628 A.2d 305, to support its final contention that a clear mandate of public policy must have an intended extraterritorial effect. To advance its position, Mobil offers a hypothetical set forth in <em>D\u2019Agostino </em>which illustrates the proposition that \u201cforum policies are [often] not intended to have extraterritorial effect.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 540, 628 A.2d 305. The Court posited:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b156-5\">For example, we might consider the hypothetical case of a researcher forbidden by federal law to conduct fetal research in the United States who, as an employee of a foreign subsidiary of a New Jersey company, is ordered to do fetal research in Canada.

A parent company in New Jersey that requires a Canadian employee of a subsidiary to do such research would not thereby violate a clear mandate of public policy.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b156-6\"><em>[Id. </em>at 540-541, 628 A.2d 305].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b156-7\">D\u2019Agostino was a United States citizen employed in Switzerland ' by the Swiss subsidiary of a New Jersey corporation. <em>Id. </em>at 519-520, 628 A.2d 305.

The Court found that \u201ccommercial bribery abroad ha[d] a potential effect on New Jersey and the health and welfare of its citizens\u201d given the reality that the Swiss drug review boards affected documents used in the United States for the registration of drugs by the Food and Drug Administration as well as the registration of drugs in Switzerland. <em>Id. </em>at 532-533, 628 A.2d 305.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-5\">The Court cautioned that \u201c[w]e do not suggest that the \u2018whistle blower\u2019 act [CEPA] itself has an extraterritorial effect; rather it reflects our common-law employment law, which will apply extra-territorially only when the underlying clear mandate of public policy is intended to have an extraterritorial effect.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 533-534, 628 A.2d 305. In rendering its decision, however, the Court was rejecting Johnson &amp; Johnson\u2019s argument that \u201cNew Jersey ha[d] no cognizable interest in regulating Swiss employment relationships.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 526, 628 A.2d 305. Because <em>DAgostino </em>involved a Swiss resident employed by a Swiss company in Switzerland, the Court decided that it had to justify extending \u201cthe <em>Pierce </em>doctrine ... to a foreign resident employed in another country.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b157-6\">Unlike <em>DAgostino, </em>we are not confronted here with this situation because there has been no extension of CEPA to a foreign employment relationship in this case. Mehlman was not a Japanese employee working in Japan; he was a New Jersey citizen employed in New Jersey by a domestic company. As New Jersey law unquestionably applies here, CEPA has not been given extraterritorial application. Therefore, we need not decide whether our public policy has an intended extraterritorial effect through the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>potential impact of Mobil\u2019s action on New Jersey and its citizens in order to justify Mehlman\u2019s invocation of CEPA protection. Even so, the public policy requiring warning labeling of gasoline with over 5% benzene, <em>see </em>16 <em>C.F.R. </em>\u00a7 1500.14(b)(3)(i), had a direct corollary in the form of the Japanese Petroleum Association guideline and would have applied in any event through Mobil\u2019s \u201cPolicy On Product Safety Stewardship\u201d in the absence of comparable Japanese governmental regulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-5\">Taken separately or collectively, the aforementioned proofs amply demonstrate that Mehlman identified a clear mandate of public policy which he reasonably believed that Mobil had violated when he objected in September 1989 to the distribution in Japan of gasoline with an excessive benzene content by Mobil subsidiary MSKK. The mandate was applicable in Japan through a professional association guideline as well as Mobil policy. The trial judge erred in finding to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-6\">\n<em>B.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b158-7\">Mobil contends that the dismissal of Mehlman\u2019s CEPA award was necessary to prevent a violation of the Commerce Clause through the improper regulation of foreign commerce. <em>See U.S. Const. </em>art I, \u00a7 8, cl. 3 (\u201cThe Congress shall have Power ... [t]o regulate Commerce with foreign Nations, and among the several States, and with the Indian Tribes____\u201d). Mobil alleges that the jury verdict results in \u201ca New Jersey law, regulation or other \u2018mandate\u2019 limiting benzene levels\u201d in Japanese gasoline in a way that burdens a multinational corporation in the conduct of foreign commerce without promoting any legitimate state interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-10\">A CEPA award does not amount to the regulation of commerce. In the first place, our Supreme Court has established that a public policy mandate may support a wrongful discharge claim without governing conduct outside of that claim. <em>See Hennessey v. Coastal Eagle Point Oil Co., supra, </em>129 <em>N.J. </em>at 98-99, 609 A.2d 11 (holding that New Jersey Constitution was one of several sources of \u201ca clear mandate of public policy in privacy rights\u201d supporting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>wrongful discharge claim but \u201cemphasiz[ing] that we are <em>not </em>finding in this opinion a constitutional right to privacy that governs the conduct of private actors\u201d). Furthermore, if the Legislature had intended to prohibit an employer\u2019s conduct which gives rise to a CEPA claim, then there would have been no reason for it to have added the \u201cclear mandate of public policy\u201d provision in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:19-3c(3). The statute would have simply provided that an employer may not retaliate against an employee for objecting to activity which the employee believes is in violation of a law, rule or regulation, or is fraudulent or criminal.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-6\">Moreover, state control over an employment relationship within its boundaries does not impose an impermissible burden upon foreign commerce. For example, the Supreme Court of the United States has rejected the argument that a state anti-discrimination law, when applied to an interstate air carrier, imposed an undue burden upon commerce in violation of the Commerce Clause. <em>See The Colorado Anti-Discrimination Comm\u2019n v. Continental Air Lines, Inc., </em>372 <em>U.S. </em>714, 722, 83 <em>S.Ct. </em>1022, 1026, 10 L.Ed.2d 84, 90 (1963). Interpreting federal precedent forbidding racial segregation in the treatment of passengers as mandating uniformity in the field, the Supreme Court of Colorado had invalidated the anti-discrimination law. 372 <em>U.S. </em>at 719, 83 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1024, 10 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 88. In reversing that decision, the United States Supreme Court reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-7\">We are not convinced that commerce will be unduly burdened if Continental is required by Colorado to refrain from racial discrimination in its hiring of pilots in that State. Not only is the hiring within a State of an employee, even for an interstate job, a much more localized matter than the transporting of passengers from State to State but more significantly the threat of diverse and conflicting regulation of hiring practices is virtually nonexistent</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-8\">[372 <em>U.S. </em>at 721, <em>83 S.Ct. </em>at 1025, <em>10 L.Ed.2d </em>at 89 (footnote omitted) ].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b159-9\">The Court also observed that discrimination against passengers on the basis of race was forbidden under the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments. 372 <em>U.S. </em>at 722, 83 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1026, 10 L.Ed.2d at 89-90.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-10\">Similarly, foreign commerce will not be impermissibly burdened if New Jersey requires Mobil to refrain from retaliatory discharge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>of an intrastate employee for objecting to what he reasonably believed was a violation of public policy. The employment relationship within New Jersey is a \u201clocalized matter.\u201d Moreover, we note that Congress has established a national policy of protecting conscientious employees. <em>See </em>Whistleblower Protection Act of 1989, 5 <em>U.S.C.A </em>\u00a7 1201.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-4\">In <em>Instructional Sys., Inc. v. Computer Curriculum Corp., </em>130 <em>N.J. </em>324, 328, 614 A.2d 124 (1992), the Court applied the New Jersey Franchise Practices Act, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>56:10-1 to -15, to the contractual relationship between an out-of-state producer of a computerized educational system and its New Jersey-based, exclusive regional distributor. The Court determined that the extraterritorial effect of the statute did not violate the Commerce Clause merely by \u201cregulat[ing] in-state conduct that has out-of-state effects.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 368, 614 A.2d 124. State regulation affecting interstate commerce is permissible so long as designed to further a legitimate state interest with no more than an incidental impact upon interstate commerce. <em>Ibid. </em>As the Court recognized,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-5\">[w]ere it otherwise, nearly every aspect of substantive state law would be disabled from affecting the conduct of multi-state corporations. When New Jersey law imposes a legal duty on the volitional behavior of a contracting party, that ruling will often have effects beyond state boundaries.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-6\">The proposition is \u201cfairly well established that a state may regulate its residents, even when they are acting outside of the state.\u201d [Lea Brilmayer and Charles Norchi, <em>Federal Eriraierritoriality and Fifth Amendment Due Process, </em>105 <em>Harv. L. Rev, </em>1217,] 1241 [ (1992) ] (discussing <em>Skiriotes v. Florida, </em>313 <em>U.S. </em>69, 61 <em>S.Ct. </em>924, 85 <em>L.Ed </em>1193 (1941)). In <em>Skiriotes, </em>the State applied its law to one of its residents who, while outside the state\u2019s territorial waters, had violated environmental regulations. The Supreme Court upheld the State\u2019s action. <em>Ibid.; Skiriotes, supra, </em>313 <em>U.S. </em>at 79, 61 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 930, 85 <em>L.Ed. </em>at 1201. A State\u2019s power over its own citizens should extend to protection of its own citizens\u2019 rights when dealing with others even though there may be incidental effects in other jurisdictions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-7\"><em>[Id. </em>at 369-370, 614 A.2d 124].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b160-8\">That case has thus already decided favorably to Mehlman\u2019s position the question of whether New Jersey, through CEPA, may regulate the conduct of a multi-state corporation and may protect <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>its own citizens despite any incidental effect of such regulation on commerce with Japan.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-6\">The cases upon which Mobil relies involved state regulation which, unlike CEPA, unduly burdened or unfairly discriminated against interstate commerce either directly or in their effect.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b161-7\">Moreover, Mobil has failed to show that Mehlman\u2019s CEPA award would either unfairly discriminate against or unduly burden foreign commerce. Even assuming that a CEPA award somehow resulted in burdening foreign commerce, we consider New Jersey\u2019s interest in protecting whistle-blowers to outweigh any such incidental effect. \u201cLegislation is valid if it even-handedly regulates to advance legitimate local interests, notwithstanding incidental effects on interstate commerce, unless \u2018the burden imposed on such commerce is clearly excessive to the putative local benefits.\u2019 \u201d <em>Crespo v. Stapf, </em>128 <em>N.J. </em>351, 361, 608 A2d 241 (1992) (quoting <em>Pike v. Bruce Church, Inc., supra, </em>397 <em>U.S. </em>at 142, 90 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 847, 25 L.Ed.2d at 178). Any impact on foreign <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>commerce resulting from a CEPA award here would be remote and incidental. Mobil could still opt to produce and to sell gasoline in Japan containing excessive benzene levels despite the known adverse consequences, subject of course to the actions of Japanese officials. On the other hand, contrary to Mobil\u2019s argument, New Jersey has \u00e1 legitimate and important interest in protecting employees in this state who protest their employers\u2019 improper activities, wherever those activities occur. This interest outweighs any incidental effect on foreign commerce.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-4\">We emphasize that a judgment for Mehlman under CEPA is by no means the equivalent of a requirement that Mobil must maintain any particular level of benzene in its Japanese gasoline. Instead, validation of Mehlman\u2019s CEPA claim signifies only that Mobil may not terminate Mehlman\u2019s New Jersey employment in retaliation for his protesting the level of benzene that Mobil permits in its Japanese gasoline. Mobil is free, within the bounds of Japanese regulation, to produce and to sell gasoline in Japan containing the benzene level of its choice. Our decision here simply upholds the jury\u2019s finding that Mobil's attempted discharge of Mehlman violated CEPA, which imposes no impermissible burden upon foreign commerce.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-5\">Mobil\u2019s final contention is that the jury\u2019s CEPA award to Mehlman unavoidably interferes with our nation\u2019s foreign policy. <em>See Zschernig v. Miller, </em>389 <em>U.S. </em>429, 88 <em>S.Ct. </em>664, 19 L.Ed.2d 683, <em>reh\u2019g denied, </em>390 <em>U.S. </em>974, 88 <em>S.Ct. </em>1018, 19 L.Ed.2d 1196 (1968). In <em>Zschemig, </em>an Oregon law had allowed a resident\u2019s estate to pass to a non-resident alien heir only if the alien had a right to receive it \u201cwithout confiscation\u201d and if United States citizens had a right to take property and receive payment of funds in this country from estates in the alien\u2019s country. 389 <em>U.S. </em>at 430-431, 88 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 665, 19 L.Ed.2d at 686. This was held to be State intrusion into foreign affairs. The Court discerned that \u201c[t]he statute as construed seems to make unavoidable judicial criticism of nations established on a more authoritarian basis than our own.\u201d 389 <em>U.S. </em>at 440, 88 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 670, 19 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 692.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>By contrast, this case does not require our courts to evaluate either the Japanese form of government or the credibility of Japanese officials. Mehlman did not criticize the Japanese or their foreign policy attitudes. Rather, it may be asserted that he acted in the interests of the health, safety, and welfare of the Japanese people in objecting to what he believed, based on information given him, were the benzene levels in gasoline sold by Mobil\u2019s Japanese subsidiary.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-5\">The <em>Zschemig </em>Court did not prohibit our state courts from evaluating foreign laws in adjudicating CEPA claims:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b163-6\">State courts, of course, must frequently read, construe, and apply laws of foreign nations. It has never been seriously suggested that state courts are precluded from performing that function, albeit there is a remote possibility, that any holding may disturb a foreign nation \u2014 whether the matter involves commercial eases, tort cases, or some other type of controversy.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b163-7\">[389 <em>U.S. </em>at 433, 88 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 667, 19 L.Ed.2d at 688].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b163-8\">To the contrary, construction of the Japanese Petroleum Association guideline and the Japanese Environment Agency Notification was necessary to resolve this controversy. The possibility of disturbing the Japanese government is thus remote at best. Accordingly, we hold that Mehlman\u2019s CEPA award was neither repugnant to the Commerce Clause nor an intrusion into our nation\u2019s foreign policy-making.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-9\">\n<em>III.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b163-10\">We now address Mobil\u2019s appeal. Mobil objects to the trial judge\u2019s amendment of the complaint to incorporate a claim of prima facie tort as well as to the award of punitive damages thereon. Mobil argues that the trial and the jury charge were based only on Mehlman\u2019s CEPA and contract claims; Mobil had neither notice nor opportunity to defend against the new claim; and, punitive damages cannot be awarded without an underlying cause of action, which it maintains was nonexistent. Mobil further contends that the punitive damages award violated its rights to procedural and substantive due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>In setting aside the jury verdict, the trial judge considered punitive damages to have been appropriate because Mobil\u2019s conduct had been \u201creprehensible under the circumstances.\u201d The judge cited two \u201cwhistle-blower\u201d situations from recent news stories, in which the organization counter-attacked with a \u201csmear campaign\u201d against the employee. The judge observed that Mehlman had \u201cclearly\u201d and \u201coverwhelmingly refuted\u201d Mobil\u2019s charges of theft and \u201cthe attempt to orchestrate a smear campaign\u201d against him. Although Mehlman attempts to buttress that decision by describing his \u201cnew\u201d cause of action as related to malicious interference with a contractual agreement \u2014 the Japanese Petroleum Association\u2019s prohibition of the sale of gasoline with benzene levels in excess of 5%, the judge did not explain the elements of Mehlman\u2019s prima facie tort claim and how they applied to the facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-4\">Mehlman asserts that he did not know about the Japanese Petroleum Association agreement until Drummond testified about it.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> By telling the truth, Mehlman maintains that he \u201cunwittingly sought to enforce Mobil\u2019s obligations under the Agreement.\u201d According to Mehlman, Mobil \u201ctortiously and maliciously interfered\u201d with the agreement by terminating him and \u201cbrandling] him a thief in order to silence him or destroy his credibility.\u201d Mehlman acknowledges that \u201cthe traditional tort of malicious interference does not precisely fit this case,\u201d but argues in support of a prima facie tort theory that this intentional, malicious, and unjustified harm should be actionable.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>Mobil responds that the judge rejected this theory in favor of an \u201coutrage\u201d theory, but cites no place in the record where this occurred. Even though the judge\u2019s decision was based upon Mobil\u2019s \u201cattempt to orchestrate a smear campaign\u201d against Mehlman, the final judgment simply stated the complaint was amended \u201cto include a claim under the doctrine of <em>prima facie </em>tort.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b165-5\">In support of a prima facie tort claim,<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Mehlman relies upon <em>Trautwein v. Harbourt, </em>40 <em>N.J.Super. </em>247, 266, 123 A.2d 30 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>22 <em>N.J. </em>220, 125 A.2d 233 (1956), where we rejected a cause of action for malicious exclusion from membership in a fraternal organization, but found \u201cno difficulty with the theoretical concept, expressed in various ways by modem jurisprudence, that intentional, willful or malicious harms of any kind are actionable unless justified.\u201d Mehlman maintains that merely because his action does not fit into a well \u201cdefined or established \u2018cubby-hole\u2019 of the law\u201d should not deny him relief. Mobil counters that \u201cNew Jersey is an employment-at-will state,\u201d and that \u201c[n]o New Jersey court has ever recognized the doctrine of prima facie tort in a wrongful termination case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b165-6\">Even if the judge was correct in allowing amendment of the complaint to allow Mehlman to assert a cause of action for prima facie tort, Mobil correctly argues that the CEPA waiver provision, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:19-8, precludes this claim.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:19-8 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-7\">Nothing in this act shall be deemed to diminish the rights, privileges, or remedies of any employee under any other federal or State law or regulation or under any collective bargaining agreement or employment contract; except that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>the institution of an action in accordance with this act shall be deemed a waiver of the rights and remedies available under any other contract, collective bargaining agreement, State law, rule or regulation or under the common law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b166-5\">In <em>Young v. Schering Corp., </em>141 <em>N.J. </em>16, 660 A.2d 1153 (1995),<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> the Court interpreted this waiver provision as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-6\">A literal reading of the statute should not be invoked because we are thoroughly convinced the Legislature did not intend to penalize former employees by forcing them to choose between a CEPA claim and other legitimate claims that are substantially, if not totally, independent of the retaliatory discharge claim.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-7\">One purpose of CEPA is to make it easier, not harder, for a former employee to prevail on a retaliatory discharge claim____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-9\"><em>[Id. </em>at 25-26, 660 A.2d 1153 (citations omitted) ].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b166-10\">Recognizing that the purpose of the waiver provision is to prevent \u201cmultiple or duplicative claims based on retaliatory discharge,\u201d the Court held that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-11\">once a CEPA claim is \u201cinstituted,\u201d any rights or claims for retaliatory discharge based on a contract of employment; collective bargaining agreement; State law, whether its origin is the Legislature, the courts, the common law or rules of court; or regulations or decisions based on statutory authority, are all waived.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-12\">$$$$$***</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-13\">[T]he waiver provision applies only to those causes of action that require a finding of retaliatory conduct that is actionable under CEPA The waiver exception does not apply to those causes of action that are substantially independent of the CEPA claim.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-14\"><em>[Id. </em>at 29, 660 A.2d 1153].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b166-15\">The <em>Young </em>Court concluded that the plaintiffs claims of defamation, slander, and malicious interference with prospective employment opportunities were not waived because they \u201crequire[d] different proofs than those required to sustain the CEPA claim and [did] not require a showing of retaliation as does a CEPA claim.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 32, 660 A.2d 1153 (quoting 275 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 239, 645 A.2d 1238). By contrast, there is a direct evidential relationship between Mobil\u2019s discharge of Mehlman in an effort to inter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>fere with his enforcement of the Japanese Petroleum Association agreement (prima facie tort claim) and Mobil\u2019s termination of Mehlman due to his objection to the company\u2019s wrongdoing (CEPA claim). Although not identical in every respect, the proofs of these claims basically consist of Mobil\u2019s discharge of Mehlman for objecting to the sale of gasoline in Japan with a benzene content of over 5%. The only difference between these causes of action is the absence of a clear mandate of public policy in the prima facie tort claim. The finding of retaliatory conduct remains essential in both. The prima facie tort claim is simply a claim for retaliatory discharge based upon the common law, thereby avoiding the CEPA requirement of a clear mandate of public policy. Mehlman\u2019s institution of his CEPA action thus waived his prima fade tort claim. <em>See id. </em>at 29, 660 A.2d 1153. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:19-8 requires no more than the institution of the CEPA action to constitute a waiver of any tort claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-6\">In view of our conclusion that Mehlman must be deemed to have waived a prima facie tort type claim, we need not address Mobil\u2019s assertion that the post-verdict amendment of the complaint deprived it of notice and an opportunity to defend against the prima facie tort claim. <em>R. Wilson Plumbing &amp; Heating, Inc. v. Wademan, </em>246 <em>N.J.Super. </em>615, 616-617, 588 A.2d 444 (App.Div.1991).<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b167-7\">Mobil argues as well that the award of punitive damages was improper without an underlying cause of action. Mehlman <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>concedes that Mobil\u2019s argument \u201chas some merit,\u201d but maintains that he is entitled to <em>\u201ccomplete </em>relief, compensatory <em>and </em>punitive damages.\u201d Mobil counters that this would \u201ccompound\u201d the error. We explained in <em>Stella v. Dean Witter Reynolds, Inc., </em>241 <em>N.J.Super. </em>55, 70, 574 A.2d 468 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>122 <em>N.J. </em>418-419, 585 A.2d 412 (1990), however, that compensatory damages are not necessary for an award of punitive damages so long as the plaintiff has suffered \u201csome harm\u201d as a result of the defendant\u2019s conduct. Mehlman was obviously severely harmed by Mobil\u2019s conduct inasmuch as the loss of his job resulted in a substantial reduction in his income and his ensuing emotional distress.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-4\">Mobil\u2019s final contention is that the punitive damages award of $3,500,000 was both unjustified and excessive in violation of due process. <em>See U.S. Const, </em>amend. XIV. Mobil relies upon <em>TXO Prod. Corp. v. Alliance Resources Corp., </em>509 <em>U.S. </em>443, 451-453, 113 <em>S.Ct. </em>2711, 2717, 125 L.Ed.2d 366, 372 (1993), which affirmed awards of $19,000 in actual damages and $10,000,000 in punitive damages for slander of title. The Court determined that the award was not so \u201cgrossly excessive\u201d as to violate the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution despite \u201cthe dramatic disparity between the actual damages and the punitive award____\u201d 509 <em>U.S. </em>at 462, 113 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2722-2723, 125 L.Ed.2d at 382. Assuming that \u201cfair procedures were followed\u201d during the jury trial, the Court concluded that \u201ca judgment that is a product of that process is entitled to a strong presumption of validity.\u201d 509 <em>U.S. </em>at 457, 113 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2720, 125 L.Ed.2d at 378. The Court explained that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-7\">[lit is appropriate to consider the magnitude of the <em>potential harm </em>that the defendant\u2019s conduct would have caused to its intended victim if the wrongful plan had succeeded, as well as the possible harm to other victims that might have resulted if similar future behavior were not deterred.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-8\">[509 <em>U.S. </em>at 460, 113 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2721-2722, 125 L.Ed.2d at 381].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b168-9\">The evidence was undisputed that benzene levels of over 5% were poisonous and that \u201cmany people would die from this ... unnecessary overexposure____\u201d The potential harm to other victims here would have been profound given the number of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>people Mehlman was trying to protect from benzene poisoning, assuming Mobil exceeded the levels. Furthermore, Mobil admits that \u201cthe trial court merely transferred the sum of $3,500,000 from the jury\u2019s award\u201d and does not challenge as procedurally deficient in any way the trial that resulted in this award. Therefore, the award deserves the strong presumption of validity established in <em>TXO Prod. Corp. v. Alliance Resources Corp., supra, </em>509 <em>U.S. </em>at 456-458, 113 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2720, 125 L.Ed.2d at 378, and strikes us as neither improper nor excessive. To the contrary, the jury\u2019s $3.5 million punitive damage award is a necessary deterrent to prevent Mobil and other companies from silencing their employees when they object to the type of harmful, dangerous conduct by their employers claimed here. This case does not present the type of punitive damages situation brought into question in the recent case of <em>BMW of N. Am., Inc. v. Gore, </em>\u2014 <em>U.S. </em>-, 116 <em>S.Ct. </em>1589, 134 L.Ed.2d 809 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b169-8\">In sum, whether or not Mobil had an opportunity to defend against the claim of prima facie tort, Mehlman waived any such claim based upon his retaliatory discharge when he instituted his CEPA claim. The trial judge thus erred in adding this claim post-trial. In light of the serious harm inflicted by Mobil on Mehlman, we nevertheless affirm the jury\u2019s punitive damage award under the CEPA claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-9\">\n<em>IV.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b169-10\">Finally, Mehlman objects to the dismissal of his defamation claim. In count VI of his amended complaint, Mehlman had alleged that Mobil, \u201cthrough its agents, officers and employees, disseminated to Mehlman\u2019s personal, professional and business peers that [he] was terminated\u201d for just cause and \u201cdue to some inappropriate action____\u201d The trial judge dismissed this count as waived under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:19-8 because it was a \u201ccommon law cause[ ] of action.... \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b169-13\">Mobil\u2019s false and defamatory publications are claimed to have caused people to conclude \u201cthat plaintiff was in fact guilty of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>maintaining conflicting interest, disloyalty, dishonesty, and other demeaning characterizations.\u201d Mobil purportedly made these statements maliciously with the intent to injure Mehlman. They have assertedly injured Mehlman, personally and professionally, causing him financial loss, \u201cpublic contempt, disgrace, scorn, prejudice and ridicule, ... grave impairment of his good name,\u201d loss of \u201cesteem and respect,\u201d \u201cgreat pain,\u201d and \u201cmental anguish.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b170-4\">Mobil argues that we \u201ccould tell from the face of the complaint\u201d that Mehlman\u2019s defamation claim resembles his CEPA claim. We disagree. The defamation claim in <em>Young </em>was basically the same as the one before us here: Mehlman claimed that his supervisor \u201cdefamed and slandered his personal and professional reputation by \u2018gratuitously broadcasting\u201d\u2019 to the professional community, including Mobil\u2019s employees, that Mehlman had been terminated for wrongdoing. <em>Young v. Schering Corp., supra, </em>275 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 226, 645 A.2d 1238. Mobil submits that Mehlman should have amended his complaint to show that his defamation claim \u201crested on facts that fell outside his CEPA claim.\u201d As we have discussed, however, any defamation claim requires different proofs than those required for a CEPA claim. <em>Id. </em>at 239, 645 A.2d 1238. On appeal, the Supreme Court confirmed that the plaintiff in <em>Young </em>did not waive his defamation claim by instituting his CEPA claim. <em>See Young v. Schering Corp., supra, </em>141 <em>N.J. </em>at 31-32, 660 A.2d 1153. The Court observed that retaliation for disagreeing with the employer\u2019s decision was not an element of defamation, and that even if plaintiff could prove defamation, \u201c \u2018such conduct will not constitute a violation of CEPA\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting 275 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 240, 645 A.2d 1238).</p>\n<p id=\"b170-5\">Noting that the amended complaint incorporates his CEPA claim into his defamation claim, Mobil asserts that the two claims were \u201cdirectly relate[d].\u201d In Mobil\u2019s view, \u201cthe alleged dissemination of the reasons for terminating Mehlman appear in the complaint to have been part and parcel of the Company\u2019s alleged \u2018retaliation\u2019 against him.\u201d This is not totally correct. The dissemination of the reasons for Mehlman\u2019s termination was made \u201cto <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>plaintiffs personal, professional and business peers,\u201d which included people outside of Mobil. Otherwise, Mehlman could not be subject to public ridicule, contempt, disgrace, scorn and prejudice, and the loss of his good name. Retaliation, on the other hand, need not involve the public or anyone outside the company.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-6\">Although some of the damages sought in a defamation action may be common to the CEPA action, Mehlman has the burden of showing different and distinct damages so as to avoid a double recovery if the reinstated defamation action is pursued.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-7\">\n<em>V</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b171-8\">In summary, Mehlman did identify a clear mandate of public policy. A Consumer Product Safety Commission regulation required products with more than 5% benzene to be labeled \u201cdanger\u201d and \u201cpoison\u201d with a skull and crossbones symbol. Although this regulation did not apply in Japan, a trade organization there had a guideline setting the benzene level of gasoline at a maximum of 5%. The technical manager for Mobil\u2019s Japanese subsidiary essentially conceded that his company was bound to follow that guideline. While Mehhnan was unaware of this guideline when he made his objection, he nonetheless reasonably believed that Japanese regulations paralleled those promulgated by our federal government. In addition, Mobil\u2019s policy called for application of health standards of developed countries in the absence of local regulation. Mehlman was also concerned about product liability, professional negligence, and professional ethics when he made his objection. Mobil\u2019s attempt to defeat the application of CEPA to this New Jersey employment relationship based upon a proffered violation of the Commerce Clause is unpersuasive. Mehlman\u2019s CEPA claim neither burdens nor discriminates against foreign commerce, and in any event, even its potential impact upon foreign commerce is at most incidental. That claim is readily distinguishable from Mehlman\u2019s defamation claim. Accordingly, the trial judge erred in dismissing Mehlman\u2019s defamation claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>The jury verdict and damages award on the CEPA claim are reinstated. The judgment on the prima facie tort claim is vacated. The dismissal of the defamation claim is reversed. The defamation claim is remanded to the Law Division for trial.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b132-8\"> Mobil alleged that Mehlman had ignored its advice to discontinue his ownership interest. By transferring it to his wife's company, Mobil claimed he diverted its assets to that enterprise. This claim was dismissed and is not the subject of this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b133-9\"> McCullough reported to Joseph D\u2019Ambrisi, Mobil Vice President of Research and Engineering and MRDC President.
