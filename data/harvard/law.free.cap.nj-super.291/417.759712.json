(Agway), appeals from the entry of summary judgment in favor of plaintiff Peter S. Watson holding that there was underinsured motorist (UIM) coverage available under Agway\u2019s business automobile and excess policies for the benefit of plaintiffs decedent Kathleen Watson. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-9\">On July 5, 1994, plaintiff Peter Watson\u2019s wife, Kathleen, was fatally injured in an automobile accident. The accident was caused when a vehicle driven by Francis Montgomery failed to stop for a stop sign and flashing red light and collided with Kathleen\u2019s vehicle. Colonial Penn Insurance Company was the liability insurer of the Montgomery automobile. It tendered its single limit liability coverage of $100,000 in settlement of the case against its insured.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-10\">At the time of the accident, Kathleen was driving a leased vehicle which was a temporary substitute for her personal automobile that was being repaired. Her personal automobile was insured by defendant First Trenton Indemnity Co. (First Trenton). Defendant Agway was the insurer under a business automobile policy and an excess insurance policy in which \u201cPeter Watson, David Watson T/A Watson Farms\u201d were the named insureds. Plaintiff notified First Trenton and Agway of his intention to make UIM claims against them, and his intentions to settle with Colonial Penn. Neither Agway nor First Trenton objected to plaintiffs acceptance of the settlement. Agway denied UIM coverage for damages resulting from Kathleen\u2019s death under its auto and excess policies.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>Plaintiff instituted this declaratory judgment action against Agway and First Trenton, seeking a determination that both First Trenton and Agway provided $500,000 in primary UIM coverage, and that Agway provided an additional $1,000,000 in excess UIM coverage. Plaintiff moved for summary judgment seeking the relief sought in his complaint as well as counsel fees. First Trenton cross-moved, essentially taking the same position as plaintiff in respect of the Agway policies, but also seeking a declaration that First Trenton\u2019s policy was excess to Agway\u2019s. Agway cross-moved seeking a determination that neither of its policies provided UIM coverage for Kathleen\u2019s accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-5\">Agway argued that there was no coverage because the named insured in the Agway policies is a partnership, and, as such, the wife of an individual partner cannot receive third party UIM benefits under the terms of either policy. The Law Division judge, Lee B. Laskin, rejected that argument. He ruled that the Agway policies provided UIM coverage for Kathleen; that the Agway and First Trenton policies were co-primary and afforded $200,000 in UIM coverage under each policy; and that Agway\u2019s excess policy provided an additional $1,000,000 of coverage. Plaintiff\u2019s application for attorney fees was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-6\">Agway appeals from that decision and plaintiff cross-appeals from the denial of counsel fees. First Trenton joins in plaintiffs contention that the Agway policies afford UIM coverage in these circumstances. Neither insurer challenges the trial court\u2019s determination of co-primary coverage in the event we hold that there is coverage under the Agway policies. Agway concedes on appeal that if we find UIM coverage under the auto policy, there is also coverage under the excess policy, inasmuch as the arguments made under the auto policy are the same as those advanced under the excess policy. Therefore, we shall focus our analysis on the terms of the auto policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-7\">The declarations page of the Agway policy describes the coverage as \u201cCOMMERCIAL AUTO COVERAGE PART/ BUSINESS AUTO DECLARATIONS.\u201d The \u201cNamed Insured\u201d is identified <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>as \u201cPeter Watson, David Watson T/A Watson Farms.\u201d Underneath the designation of the named insured, the policy has the following words contained on one line: \u201cForm of Business: [] Individual [x] Partnership [ ] Corporation [ ]Other__\u201d As indicated, the box next to the word \u201cPartnership\u201d was marked with an \u201cx.\u201d The policy provided for liability coverage of $500,000 with uninsured (UM) and UIM coverage in the same amount.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-8\">The UIM endorsement affords coverage to an \u201cinsured\u201d who is entitled to recover compensatory damages from the owner or driver of an \u201cunderinsured motor vehicle.\u201d It is conceded for the purpose of this litigation that the Montgomery vehicle was under-insured. An \u201cinsured\u201d is defined in the endorsement as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-9\">1. You.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-10\">2. If you are an individual, any \u201cfamily member.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-11\">3. Anyone else \u201coccupying\u201d a covered \u201cauto\u201d or a temporary substitute for a covered \u201cauto.\u201d The covered \u201cauto\u201d must be out of service because of its breakdown, repair, servicing, loss or destruction.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-12\">4. Anyone for damages he or she is entitled to recover because of \u201cbodily injury\u201d sustained by another \u201cinsured.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b449-13\">A \u201cfamily member\u201d is defined in the endorsement as \u201ca person related to you by blood, marriage, or adoption who is a resident of your household, including a ward or foster child.\u201d The word \u201cyou\u201d is not defined in the endorsement, but it is defined elsewhere in the policy this way:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-14\">Throughout this policy the words \u201cyou\u201d and \u201cyour\u201d refer to the Named Insured shown in the Declarations.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b449-15\">Plaintiff reasons that \u201cyou\u201d in paragraph one of the UIM endorsement refers to Peter in the context of the facts of this case because he is a named insured on the declarations page of the policy. Further, Peter is an \u201cindividual.\u201d Therefore, inasmuch as Kathleen is Peter\u2019s \u201cfamily member,\u201d she is an insured under the terms of paragraph two of the endorsement.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-16\">Agway, however, contends in its brief that while</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AOc\">Peter Watson and David Watson standing alone may be individualst,] ... when taken together as designated on the policy, they are a partnership unit. Peter Watson and David Watson are not insured as \u201cindividuals\u201d but instead, are insured as a \u201cpartnership\u201d under the explicit terms of the Agway policies.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b450-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>At oral argument, great emphasis was placed on the fact that an \u201cx\u201d was typed in the box next to \u201cpartnership\u201d as the form of business being engaged in by the named insureds. However, Agway has failed to point to anything in the policy which makes that designation a significant factor in determining coverage. As we read the policy, coverage is determined by how the \u201cnamed insured\u201d is described in the policy, not what business form the named insured has elected to utilize. We reiterate, the \u201cnamed insured\u201d in the Agway policy is designated as \u201cPeter Watson, David Watson T/A Watson Farms.\u201d The named insured is not, for example, \u201cWatson Farms, a partnership.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b450-5\">Despite Agway\u2019s contention that Peter and David Watson are not insured as \u201cindividuals,\u201d its conduct and statements reveal otherwise. Several endorsements to the auto policy, effective as of June 20, 1994, the original issue date of the policy, refer to the \u201cnamed insured\u201d as \u201cPeter Watson, David Watson.\u201d Agway\u2019s counsel\u2019s letter of November 15, 1994, recognized' that \u201cPeter Watson is a named insured under both Agway policies.\u201d Agway, through a representative at depositions, agreed with its counsel\u2019s statement in that letter. He also acknowledged that the word \u201cyou\u201d as used in the policy in general, and specifically as used in the UIM endorsement, referred to Peter Watson as a named insured. Further, the representative acknowledged that Peter Watson would be covered under the UIM endorsement as the \u201cyou\u201d referred to in paragraph one of the endorsement; that he was the same \u201cyou\u201d referred to again in paragraph two, and that Kathleen was a \u201cfamily member.\u201d Finally, he admitted that Peter Watson would be entitled to UIM coverage even if he were operating a non-covered automobile under the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-6\">Notwithstanding these admissions, Agway maintains that there is no coverage for Peter Watson as an \u201cindividual.\u201d Agway\u2019s argument comes to this: Peter Watson, the natural person, loses his identity as an individual because he is a partner in Watson Farms. Reduced to its essence, the argument is untenable because it is contrary to the reasonable expectations of an average <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>person who reads the policy and is conversant with the English language. <em>Doto v. Russo, </em>140 <em>N.J. </em>544, 556, 659 A.2d 1371 (1995). Nowhere in the policy does it state that where a natural person is listed as a named insured, the natural person qualifies as \u201cyou\u201d for UIM coverage for himself or herself, but is not an \u201cindividual\u201d in order to qualify a family member for the same coverage. Indeed, the word \u201cindividual\u201d is not defined in the endorsement or elsewhere. Therefore, it must be given its common sense meaning in the context in which it is used: \u201ca single human being as contrasted with a social group or institution.\u201d <em>Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary, </em>1152 (1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b451-5\">The best that can be said for the policy language in light of Agway\u2019s argument is that it is ambiguous, which is of no solace to Agway. If the controlling language of an insurance policy supports two interpretations, one favorable to the insurer and the other favorable to the insured, courts are obliged to adopt the interpretation supporting coverage. <em>Salem v. Oliver, </em>248 <em>N.J.Super. </em>265, 271, 590 A.2d 1194 (App.Div.1991), <em>aff'd o.b., </em>128 <em>N.J. </em>1, 4, 607 A.2d 138 (1992). \u201cRecognizing the position of laymen with respect to insurance policies prepared and marketed by the insurer; our courts have endorsed the principle of giving effect to the \u2018reasonable expectations\u2019 of the insured for the purposes of rendering a \u2018fair interpretation of the boundaries of insurance coverage.\u2019 \u201d <em>DiOrio v. New Jersey Mfrs. Ins. Co., </em>79 <em>N.J. </em>257, 269, 398 A.2d 1274 (1979). This is especially so where, as here, the wording of the policy is at best ambiguous from the standpoint of the insured. <em>State, Dep\u2019t of Envtl. Protection v. Signo Trading Int\u2019l., </em>130 <em>N.J. </em>51, 62, 612 A.2d 932 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b451-6\"><em>Giambri v. Geico, </em>170 <em>N.J.Super. </em>140, 405 A.2d 872 (Law Div.1979), <em>aff'd o.b., </em>174 <em>N.J.Super. </em>162, 415 A.2d 1202 (App.Div. 1980), cited by Agway to support its argument that the policy provides coverage only for the partnership as an entity, is factually inapposite. In that case, a family-owned corporation was the named insured on a policy covering four vehicles. No individuals were listed on the policy as named insureds. <em>Id. </em>at 141, 405 A.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>872. Therefore, we have no quarrel with the result arrived at there which denied PIP benefits to a corporate employee who was also a member of the owners\u2019 family.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-5\">In <em>American Bankers Ins. Co. of Florida v. Stack, </em>208 <em>N.J.Super. </em>75, 79, 504 A.2d 1219 (Law Div.1984), cited by plaintiff in his brief, an unincorporated trade name business was held to be functionally interchangeable with its <em>individual </em>principal. In that case the named insured was an unincorporated trade name sole proprietorship owned by defendant\u2019s father. <em>Id. </em>at 77, 504 A.2d 1219; <em>see also, </em>Craig &amp; Pommeroy, <em>New Jersey Auto Insurance Law, </em>\u00a7 21:2-1. After an accident with an uninsured motorist, plaintiff disclaimed UM coverage for the defendant, a passenger in someone else\u2019s truck, on the ground that the policy covered only the business and not the family members. <em>Ibid. </em>The court relied upon the decision of a federal court in <em>O\u2019Hanlon v. Hartford Acc. &amp; Indemn. Co., </em>639 F.2d 1019, 1025 (3d Cir.1981), which held that a trade name was nothing more than the alter ego of the individual. <em>American Bankers, supra, </em>208 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 79, 504 A.2d 1219.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-6\">While <em>American Bankers, supra, </em>shows that New Jersey courts are willing to find an unincorporated business to be interchangeable with the sole proprietor for insurance coverage purposes, it is not helpful in deciding whether this court should find that a partnership is the functional equivalent of its partners for insurance coverage purposes. However, other jurisdictions that have dealt with this issue have held that where the individuals along with the partnership are listed as the named insured, the individuals are covered in that capacity.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-7\">In <em>Nationwide Mutual Ins. Co. v. United States Fidelity and Guaranty Co., </em>529 <em>F.Supp. </em>194 (E.D.Pa.1981), the court held that the provision of an insurance policy listing the named insured as two individuals trading as their last name was ambiguous, and that reasonable individuals could differ as to whether the provision designated the partnership, the individuals, or both as the named insured. <em>Id. </em>at 198. In that case, the insurance company, USF &amp; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>G, had issued a comprehensive general automobile liability policy covering two vehicles owned or leased by Treegoob Appliances, Inc.. <em>Id. </em>at 195. An endorsement to the policy identified the named insured of that policy as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b453-6\">It is hereby agreed and understood that the Named Insured is:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b453-7\">Harold and Warren Treegoob T/A Treegoob\u2019s;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b453-8\">Treegoob\u2019s Appliances, Inc.;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b453-9\">Warren Mark Corporation;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b453-10\">Valient Finance Company, Inc.;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b453-11\">Valient Consumer Discount Company, AT.I.M.A</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b453-12\">\n<em>[Ibid.]</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b453-13\">When Warren Treegoob\u2019s minor son was struck and severely injured by an automobile while he was crossing the street, the insurer denied coverage for the son\u2019s injuries. It claimed that the partnership, and not Warren Treegoob individually, was the named insured. <em>Ibid. </em>The court held that the policy provision was ambiguous and resolved the ambiguity against the insurer. It found that the provision listing \u201cHarold and Warren Treegoob T/A Treegoob\u2019s\u201d designated Warren Treegoob, the individual, as a named insured under the policy. <em>Id. </em>at 198. Therefore, Warren\u2019s son was entitled to personal injury protection benefits under the Pennsylvania No Fault Act. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b453-14\">Even though the court in <em>Nationwide Mutual, supra, </em>based its determination on the ambiguity of the policy provisions, it alternatively relied upon Pennsylvania\u2019s adherence to the aggregate theory of partnership. <em>Id. </em>at 200. The court predicted that under the aggregate theory of partnership, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court would hold that the designation of the named insured as \u201cHarold and Warren Treegoob T/A Treegoob\u2019s\u201d insured Warren Treegoob in his individual capacity. <em>Ibid. </em>The court cited language from a Pennsylvania Supreme Court decision issued after the adoption of the Uniform Partnership Act regarding the basic law in the Commonwealth on partnerships:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b453-15\">We deem it to be the law of Pennsylvania and the approved opinion in most jurisdictions that a partnership is not recognized as a legal entity having such a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>domicile or residence separate and distinct from that of the individuals who compose it. It is rather a relation or status between two or more persons who unite their labor or property to carry on a business for profit. This is subject to an apparent exception, for while a partnership as such is not a person, it, as a matter of fact, is treated by a legal fiction as a quasi person or an entity for such purposes as keeping of partnership accounts and marshalling assets.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b454-5\"><em>[In Morrison\u2019s Estate, </em>343 <em>Pa. </em>157, 22 A.2d 729, 732 (1941).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b454-6\">Likewise, in <em>Ohio Casualty Insurance Co. v. Fike, </em>304 So. 2d 136 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App.1974), the Florida District Court of Appeal held that, although in the commercial sense a partnership is looked upon as a legal entity, Florida follows the common law view \u201cthat a partnership is not a legal entity apart from the members composing it.\u201d <em>Fike, supra, </em>304 So.2d at 137. The court held that where a policy of insurance refers to the partnership entity as the named insured and then proceeds to list the names of the individual partners in describing the named insured, the policy must be read to cover \u201cthe partners as individuals as well as partners as an entity\u201d unless a contrary intention clearly appears. <em>Ibid. </em>Consequently in that case, the court found that the policy listing the named insured as \u201cRussell C. Fike, Jr. and Robert D. Fike d/b/a Orange State Painting Co.\u201d provided coverage to Russell\u2019s daughter under the no-fault provisions of the policy when she was struck by an automobile while walking. <em>Id. </em>at 136. The court also noted that it could have made the same determination on the basis of ambiguity. <em>Id. </em>at 137, n. 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-7\">Finally, in <em>Grotelueschen v. American Family Mutual Ins. Co., </em>171 Wis.2d 437, 492 <em>N.W.2d </em>131 (1992), the Wisconsin Supreme Court held that an insurance policy\u2019s comprehensive general liability provision which insured a partnership and also listed individual partners by name, covered the insured as an individual with respect to injuries sustained by his granddaughter while he was mowing a lot. <em>Id. </em>492 N.W.2d at 135, <em>see also McDonald v. Aetna Casualty &amp; Surety Co., </em>47 Wis.2d 235, 177 N.W.2d 101 (1970). The <em>Grotelueschen </em>court based its decision upon Wisconsin\u2019s view of the partnership as an aggregate as opposed to an entity. <em>Id. </em>492 N.W.2d at 134-135. The court explained that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b455-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>Wisconsin law views a partnership as an aggregate for some purposes and as an entity for others, [citations omitted]. For example, a partnership conveys and holds title to property as a separate entity, [citations omitted]. However, the definition of a partnership \u2014 \u201can association of two or more persons to carry on as co-owners [of] a business for profit\u201d \u2014 views the partnership as an aggregate. Thus, whether Wisconsin views a partnership as a separate legal entity or an aggregate of individual partners depends upon the issue.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b455-6\"><em>[Id. </em>at 134.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b455-7\">The court ultimately held that, where the individuals as well as the partnership were listed as named insureds, the aggregate theory applied, and the partners were covered in an individual capacity. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b455-8\">In New Jersey, courts have approached partnership law in a manner similar to the Wisconsin courts. By statute, New Jersey defines a partnership as, \u201can association of two or more persons to carry on as co-owners of a business for profit.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>42:1-6. Thus, the statute defines partnership as an aggregate of persons. However, like Wisconsin, New Jersey views a partnership as a legal entity for some purposes and as an aggregate for others. For the purposes of facilitating transfers of property, marshalling assets, and protecting the business operation against the immediate impact of personal involvements of the partners, the partnership is regarded as a legal entity. <em>Mazzuchelli v. Silberberg, </em>29 <em>N.J. </em>15, 21, 148 A.2d 8 (1959); <em>see also Eule v. Eule Motor Sales, </em>34 <em>N.J. </em>537, 545, 170 A.2d 241 (1961) (partnership regarded as entity where wife of partner sues partnership for injuries negligently inflicted by husband while driving automobile owned by partnership); <em>Felice v. Felice, </em>34 <em>N.J.Super. </em>388, 391-92, 112 A.2d 581 (App.Div.1955) (with respect to worker\u2019s compensation, partnership is regarded as an entity for the purposes of determining the liability to an employee-wife of a partner). For tax purposes, a partnership is not a legal entity but merely, an aggregation of individuals who have pooled skills, services, or capital to make an income. <em>Hoblitzell v. Howard, </em>30 <em>N.J.Super. </em>159, 103 A.2d 625 (Ch.Div.1954), <em>aff'd, </em>18 <em>N.J. </em>104, 112 A.2d 715 (1955).</p>\n<p id=\"b456-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>In this case, we employ the aggregate theory of partnership. As in the previously cited cases that have considered the issue, the individual partners were listed along with the partnership as the named insured. To do so fulfills the reasonable expectations of the insureds in the context of the language used in the policy and is consistent with established principles of partnership law.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
