The sole contention raised in his brief is his claim of error in the failure of the trial judge to credit the Social Security Disability benefits paid to the mother for their unemancipated son, both prospectively and retroactively to December 1,1992.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b586-8\">The relevant facts can be stated briefly. Defendant is disabled and receiving Social Security Disability benefits. Because of this, his son Alexandra, in the custody of the mother, is also receiving Social Security benefits. The father contends that the Court\u2019s Child Support Guidelines, more particularly line 10b of the Child Support Obligation Worksheet, Current N.J. Court Rules, Appendix IX-D, mandate the son\u2019s benefit be credited against the Basic Child Support Amount.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-9\">Line 10 of the Worksheet calculates the Total Child Support Amount. It reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b586-10\">10. Basie Child Support Amount (From Appendix IX-C) $</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b586-11\">a. Net Work-Related Child Care Expenses +</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b586-12\">b. Apportionment to the Child -</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b586-13\">The use of these guidelines is spelled out in more detail in Appendix IX-E which, as relevant, says:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b586-14\">F. Apportionments for the Benefit of the Child.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b587-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>If a child is receiving a direct apportionment of disability or retirement benefits from a non-custodial parent, the amount of that apportionment should be deducted from the Basie Child Support Amount. For the purposes of these guidelines, such disability benefits may include, but are not limited to, the following: Supplemental Security Income for the Aged, Blind and Disabled, Black Lung and Veteran\u2019s Administration benefits.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b587-5\">Defendant\u2019s contentions are without merit. His son is not receiving an apportionment of his father\u2019s Social Security entitlement but is receiving a personal entitlement which arises from his father\u2019s disability.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> See 42 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>402(d). The apportionment set off provided in the Court\u2019s Guidelines relates to situations where the child\u2019s benefits are an apportionment of the parent\u2019s entitlement resulting in a decrease in the amount of the benefit paid to the parent. It is a recognition of the injustice which would result if a parent were forced to share a part of his or her benefit with the child and yet not receive any credit for that loss. Here defendant has not been required to share any part of his benefits with his child and has not suffered any loss of income by virtue of the benefits the child receives (through the custodial parent) from Social Security. See Social Security Administration Publication No. 05-10024 (January 1996) at 20.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b587-6\">We note the limited contours of our holding. The Guidelines are designed to designate an amount that \u201ceconomic research has shown to be spent on children of intact families in a similar income situation\u201d, Appendix IX-E-D(l). That amount \u2014 the \u201cBasic Child Support Obligation\u201d \u2014 constitutes the presumed financial need of the child. The child support obligation is then divided proportionately between the parents based upon their contribution to the family income. Guideline F provides that a direct apportionment of disability benefits from a non-custodial parent \u201cshould be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>deducted from the \u201cBasic Child Support Obligation.\u201d The child support obligation worksheet also indicates that the \u201capportionments to the child\u201d are to be deducted from the \u201cBasic Child Support Amount\u201d before the \u201cPercentage Share of Income\u201d is determined. See <em>Appendix IX-D. </em>Our decision here is without prejudice to defendant\u2019s right to move for a recalculation of his support obligation in accordance with the express language of Guideline F.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b586-15\"> Originally defendant claimed entitlement to credit retroactive to April 24, 1995. However by an amendment to his brief, he claimed entitlement retroactive to December 1, 1992.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b587-7\"> Apportion.
