Alex MacDonell. The action against defendant Rev. Fletcher Harper is based on his disclosure to the congregation of the relationship between plaintiff and MacDonell.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-11\">Defendants moved for judgment on the pleadings, pursuant to <em>R. </em>4:6-2(e). The court granted the motion on all counts against MacDonell and on Count IX against Harper. The three counts against MacDonell allege causes of action for negligence as a provider of \u201cpastoral care and pastoral counseling,\u201d negligent infliction of emotional distress \u201cin committing pastoral care and pastoral counseling malpractice,\u201d and breach of fiduciary duty. Count IX charged that Harper breached his fiduciary duty to plaintiff by \u201cexploiting [her] trust and confidence by invading her privacy, making negligent misrepresentations to her ... defaming her, and by depicting her in a false light.\u201d The remaining counts against Harper allege invasion of privacy, negligent misrepresentation, defamation and depicting plaintiff in a false light.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-12\">The trial court determined that the counts against MacDonell and Count IX against Harper asserted causes of action described as clergy malpractice and that such a cause of action is not recognized, citing <em>Schmidt v. Bishop, </em>779 <em>F.Supp. </em>321 (S.D.N.Y.1991). In <em>Schmidt </em>the court ruled that clergy malpractice was not actionable under New York law. The court held that recognition <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>of such a cause of action would unduly entangle the courts with religion, in violation of the First Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">We granted plaintiffs motion for leave to appeal, and we now reverse and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-6\">The standard under which motions to dismiss are considered is well-established in New Jersey. Trial courts should \u201capproach with great caution applications for dismissal under <em>R. </em>4:6-2(e) for failure of a complaint to state a claim on which relief may be granted.\u201d <em>Printing Mart-Morristown v. Sharp Elec. Corp., </em>116 <em>N.J. </em>739, 771-72, 563 A.2d 31 (1989). The test for determining the adequacy of a pleading is whether a cause of action is \u201csuggested\u201d by the facts. <em>See Velantzas v. Colgate-Palmolive Co., </em>109 <em>N.J. </em>189, 192, 536 A.2d 237 (1988). In reviewing a complaint dismissed pursuant to <em>R. </em>4:6-2(e), the inquiry is limited to examining the legal sufficiency of the facts alleged on the face of the complaint. <em>See Rieder v. State Department of Transp., </em>221 <em>N.J.Super. </em>547, 552, 535 A.2d 512 (App.Div.1987). However, a reviewing court \u201csearches the complaint in depth and with liberality to ascertain whether the fundament of a cause of action may be gleaned even from an obscure statement of claim, opportunity being given to amend if necessary.\u201d <em>Di Cristofaro v. Laurel Grove Memorial Park, </em>43 <em>N.J.Super. </em>244, 252, 128 A.2d 281 (App.Div.1957). For purposes of analysis plaintiffs are entitled to every reasonable inference of fact. <em>See Independent Dairy Workers Union v. Milk Drivers Local 680, </em>23 <em>N.J. </em>85, 89, 127 A.2d 869 (1956). \u201cThe examination of a complaint\u2019s allegations of fact required by the aforestated principles should be one that is at once painstaking and undertaken with a generous and hospitable approach.\u201d <em>Printing Mart-Morristown, supra, </em>116 <em>N.J. </em>at 746, 563 A.2d 31.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-7\">Applying these principles, we glean from the complaint the following allegations. Plaintiff was a parishioner at All Saints\u2019 Episcopal Church, and MacDonell was the rector there and at Saint Luke\u2019s Episcopal Church. Plaintiff sought counseling from MacDonell. The nature and scope of the counseling is not defined <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>in the complaint. MacDonell assumed the role of counselor and thereby became aware of plaintiffs emotional vulnerabilities. MacDonell exploited those vulnerabilities to induce plaintiff to engage in sexual acts with him. The complaint describes the counseling relationship between plaintiff and MacDonell as \u201ca special relationship in which MacDonell owed a special duty of care not to engage in unethical and harmful behavior towards [plaintiff].\u201d Plaintiff alleges that MacDonell violated that duty of care causing physical, emotional and psychological injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-6\">Count III alleges that MacDonell had a fiduciary duty to act in plaintiffs best interests and \u201cto refrain from conduct which carried with it the foreseeable and unreasonable risk of mental or emotional harm to her,\u201d and that MacDonell breached his fiduciary duty \u201cby wrongfully and unlawfully exploiting [plaintiffs] trust and confidence by engaging in inappropriate sexual behavior with plaintiff.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b295-7\">The complaint also alleges that plaintiff filed a complaint with the \u201cStanding Commission on Clergy Ethics of the Diocese of Newark,\u201d and that the committee determined that MacDonell \u201cviolated his pastoral relationship with plaintiff ... by engaging in inappropriate sexual behavior toward her.\u201d The committee \u201csanctioned\u201d MacDonell in March 1994.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-8\">In Count IX, the count against Harper dismissed by the court, plaintiff alleges that Harper breached a fiduciary duty owed to plaintiff by the manner in which he informed the congregation of plaintiffs relationship with MacDonell.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-9\">The trial court\u2019s dismissal of the counts against MacDonell was consistent with a line of decisions resistant to the concept of \u201cclergy malpractice.\u201d As previously indicated, the trial court cited <em>Schmidt v. Bishop, supra, </em>779 <em>F.Supp. </em>321. Schmidt was a member of a New York Presbyterian church. In 1960, when she was twelve, her parents brought her to Reverend Bishop, the church\u2019s pastor, for \u2018\u201cemotional, spiritual and familial counseling.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 324. Schmidt alleged that she became emotionally dependent on Bishop and that he initiated sexual contact with her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>shortly alter the counseling relationship began. According to Schmidt, defendant \u201cinvoked God as supporting the conduct ... and informed her that \u2018the relationship was special and acceptable in the eyes of the Lord.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ibid. </em>The relationship between Schmidt and Bishop continued until 1989 when Schmidt terminated it as a result of psychotherapy she had begun in 1988.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-5\">The <em>Schmidt </em>court characterized Bishop\u2019s conduct as a crime of sexual abuse in the second degree under New York\u2019s penal code. <em>Ibid. </em>The court observed that the allegations of the complaint \u201csupport clearly an action for a battery or some similar intentional tort, for which the statute of limitations is one year.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>The court, however, granted summary judgment to defendant on the complaint which alleged negligence, malpractice and breach of fiduciary duty. The court viewed those counts as sounding in clergy malpractice and rejected them.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-6\">The court saw the First Amendment of the United States Constitution as the major obstacle to a cause of action for clergy malpractice. <em>Id. </em>at 327. The court agreed with <em>Nally v. Grace Community Church of the Valley, </em>47 <em>Cal.</em>3d 278, 253 <em>Cal.Rptr. </em>97, 763 P.2d 948 (1988), <em>cert. denied, </em>490 <em>U.S. </em>1007, 109 <em>S.Ct. </em>1644, <em>104 </em>L.Ed.2d 159 (1989), that defining and imposing a duty of care on pastoral counselors would unduly entangle the courts in religious philosophy or ecclesiastical teachings. <em>Ibid. </em>The court in <em>Schmidt </em>stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b296-7\">Any effort by this Court to instruct the trial jury as to the duty of care which a clergyman should exercise, would of necessity require the Court or jury to define and express the standard of care to be followed by other reasonable Presbyterian clergy of the community. This in turn would require the Court and the jury to consider the fundamental perspective and approach to counseling inherent in the beliefs and practices of that denomination. This is as unconstitutional as it is impossible. It fosters excessive entanglement with religion.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b296-8\">[779 <em>F.Supp. </em>at 328.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b296-9\"><em>Natty v. Grace Community Church of the Valley, supra, </em>relied on by the <em>Schmidt </em>court, is inapposite. There, the Supreme Court of California upheld a \u201cnonsuit\u201d granted by the trial court, <em>i.e., </em>a trial court determination that the evidence was insufficient to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>permit a jury to find in plaintiffs\u2019 favor. <em>Nally, supra, </em>258 <em>Cal.Rptr. </em>at 104-05, 763 <em>P.2d </em>at 955. Plaintiffs sought damages resulting from the suicide of their son. Plaintiffs sued the church, a Protestant Christian congregation, and four church pastors who had participated in counseling decedent. Plaintiffs alleged that defendants had failed in their duty to recognize that decedent was suicidal and to refer him to psychiatric care.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-6\">In affirming the nonsuit, thereby reversing the intermediate appellate court, the California Supreme Court held that defendants, as nontherapist counselors, had no duty to refer a counselee to psychiatric care. The court refused to extend the duty to prevent suicide, previously imposed on psychiatrists and hospitals caring for a suicidal patient, to non-licensed nontherapist counselors who provide counseling on \u201csecular or spiritual matters.\u201d <em>Id. </em>253 <em>Cal.Rptr. </em>at 110, 763 P.2d at 961. The court observed that \u201cit would certainly be impractical, and quite possibly unconstitutional, to impose a duty of care on pastoral counselors. Such a duty would necessarily be intertwined with the religious philosophy of the particular denomination or ecclesiastical teachings of the religious entity.\u201d <em>Id. </em>253 <em>Cal.Rptr. </em>at 109, 763 <em>P.2d </em>at 960.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-7\">We distinguish <em>Natty </em>from the present case on three grounds. First, constitutional considerations played a minimal role in the court\u2019s analysis. Second, the alleged breach of duty was closely connected with the content of the counseling and advice provided by the counselors. Lastly, <em>Natty </em>did not involve exploitation of the counselee for the counselors\u2019 sexual gratification.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-8\"><em>Destefano v. Grabrian, </em>763 P.2d 275 (Colo.1988), was an action against a Catholic priest and diocese arising out of a marriage counseling relationship between the counselor-priest and a married couple, Robert and Edna Destefano. The priest and Edna became sexually involved, and the Destefanos\u2019 marriage dissolved. Robert commenced an action for damages, originally naming Edna as a co-defendant, and Edna cross-claimed against the priest and the diocese.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>In evaluating Edna\u2019s claim, the court defined the \u201cthreshold issue\u201d as whether the First Amendment immunized the priest\u2019s conduct. The court held that it did not because \u201c[w]hen the alleged wrongdoing ... clearly falls outside the beliefs and doctrine of [the priest\u2019s] religion, he cannot avail himself of the protection afforded by the first amendment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 284.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-5\">Nevertheless, the court held that the claim for clergy malpractice was properly dismissed because \u201cclergy malpractice is not supported by precedent and raises serious first amendment issues.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 285. The court\u2019s ruling in this regard appears to have been based on Colorado licensing statutes which the court construed as evidencing \u201can intent to exclude religious counselors from the liability provision of the statute creating liability for mental health professionals.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 286.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-6\">The court, however, did recognize Edna\u2019s causes of action for breach of a fiduciary duty, intentional or reckless infliction of emotional distress through outrageous conduct, and, as against the diocese, negligent supervision of the priest. <em>See also Moses v. Diocese of Colorado, </em>863 P.2d 310, 321 (Colo.1993) (reaffirming the viability of a cause of action for breach of fiduciary duty and the invalidity of a cause of action for clergy malpractice), <em>cert. denied, </em>- <em>U.S. </em>-, 114 <em>S.Ct. </em>2153, 128 L.Ed.2d 880 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b298-7\"><em>Dausch v. Rykse, 52 F.</em>3d 1425 (7th Cir.1994) was a diversity action applying Illinois law. Plaintiff alleged that she sought counseling from defendant Ryske, the pastor of her Presbyterian church. She alleged in her complaint that Ryske engaged \u201cin sexual contact during the course of psychotherapy with the plaintiff, an emotionally dependent patient.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1427. Plaintiff appealed from the dismissal of her complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-8\">The court of appeals agreed with the trial court that a claim for clergy malpractice would not be viable under Illinois law, citing <em>Baumgartner v. First Church of Christ, Scientist, </em>141 <em>Ill.App.3d </em>898, 96 <em>Ill.Dec. </em>114, 490 N.E.2d 1319, <em>cert. denied, </em>479 <em>U.S. </em>915, 107 <em>S.Ct. </em>317, 93 L.Ed.2d 290 (1986). <em>Dausch, supra, </em>52 F.3d at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>1432. The court in <em>Baumgartner </em>determined that an action for clergy malpractice was not justiciable because adjudication of such a complaint \u201c \u201cwould require the court to extensively investigate and evaluate religious tenets and doctrines.\u2019 \u201d <em>Dausch, supra, </em>52 <em>F.</em>3d at 1432 (quoting <em>Baumgartner, supra, </em>96 <em>Ill.Dec. </em>114, 490 N.E.2d at 1324.)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The court of appeals noted the risk of entangling civil courts in the examination of religious tenets if clergy malpractice were a recognized cause of action. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b299-6\">The court of appeals, however, recognized that these First Amendment concerns have not been extended \u201cto situations in which the conduct in question does not bear such a direct relationship to the doctrinal or organizational aspects of religious practice.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>The court characterized \u201cpastoral counseling\u201d as \u201cclearly and directly centered on matters of religion, and claims of negligence are not cognizable in the civil courts.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1433. However, if a church offers \u201cpurely secular counseling ... to the members of its congregation,\u201d those persons who provided such services on the church\u2019s behalf would be subject to civil adjudication of their performance. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b299-7\">Therefore, if a complaint alleges that the psychological services that were provided were \u201csecular\u201d in nature, or that the provider held himself out to be providing the services of a psychological counselor, the negligence claim cannot be characterized as one for clergy malpractice. Tort claims for behavior by a derie that does not require the examination of religious doctrine are cognizable.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b299-8\">\n<em>[Ibid.]</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b299-9\">The court of appeals held that some of the allegations in Mrs. Dausch\u2019s complaint could be read as stating a claim based on secular psychological counseling and not pastoral counseling. Consequently, it reversed the dismissal of plaintiffs claim based on professional negligence. <em>Id. </em>at 1435.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-10\">The viability of a claim for clergy malpractice is an issue of first impression in New Jersey. Malpractice is a negligence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>cause of action. It is nothing more than the negligent performance of a professional service. It is a deviation from the standards of performance applicable to the professional service in 'question. See <em>Sanzari v. Rosenfeld, </em>34 <em>N.J. </em>128, 134-35, 167 A.2d 625 (1961). A major distinction between the \u201cusual negligence case\u201d and a case of professional negligence is that in the latter, the standard of care ordinarily must be established by expert testimony. <em>Id. </em>at 134-35, 167 A.2d 625.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-5\">Regarding the risk of undue entanglement in ecclesiastical affairs arising out of a case of clergy malpractice, we share the concerns of those courts that have addressed the issue. We are, however, persuaded that those concerns are overstated in circumstances, such as the present case, involving a cleric\u2019s sexual misconduct. <em>Cf. Welter v. Seton Hall Univ., </em>128 <em>N.J. </em>279, 291, 608 A.2d 206 (1992) (holding that defendants failed to demonstrate that an employment dispute turned \u201con issues of doctrine or polity\u201d and, therefore, the trial court properly exercised jurisdiction and the \u201csincerity\u201d of defendant\u2019s religious beliefs was not legally relevant to their jurisdictional claim). <em>But cf. DeBose v. Bear Valley Church of Christ, </em>890 P.2d 214, 222 (Colo.Ct.App. 1994) (reversing a judgment in favor of plaintiffs and holding that the trial court erred in not instructing the jury that the cleric could not be held liable if his massage of the minor plaintiff \u201cwas engaged in solely in a sincere effort to facilitate the minor\u2019s communication with God\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b300-6\">We are also persuaded that the distinction suggested in <em>Dausch v. Rykse, supra, </em>between pastoral counseling and secular psychological counseling, is unworkable because it is difficult to apply. A cleric\u2019s counseling activities may be infused with doctrinal and spiritual content, though the cleric is providing secular services regarding marital discord, depression, anxiety and parent-child conflicts.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-7\">We conclude that one test to determine whether a cause of action against a cleric is cognizable in civil courts is whether adjudication of the claim requires an evaluation of dogma or ritual, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>or other matters of purely ecclesiastical concern. In the present case, it is unlikely that defendants will assert that sex with a counselee by a pastoral counselor is sanctioned by or somehow involves tenets of the Episcopalian church, or would otherwise create an entanglement with religious beliefs or rituals of First Amendment concern. <em>See Strock v. Pressnell, </em>38 <em>Ohio </em>St.3d 207, 527 <em>N.E.2d </em>1235 (1988) (holding that the First Amendment was not available as a defense in action against minister who had sexual relations with plaintiffs wife while counseling the couple regarding their marital difficulties).</p>\n<p id=\"b301-6\">Moreover, there is a bright line between counseling culminating in a sexual relationship with a counselee and other types of harms allegedly resulting from a failed counseling relationship. <em>Cf. Nally v. Grace Community Church of the Valley, supra, </em>253 <em>Cal.Rptr. </em>97, 763 P.2d at 948 (holding that claim for son\u2019s suicide was not actionable). Thus, we do not share the concern expressed in <em>Schmidt v. Bishop, supra, </em>779 <em>F.Supp. </em>321, that to recognize a cause of action for the sexual exploitation of a child would place civil courts \u201con the slippery slope,\u201d because we \u201cmust consider not only this case, but the next ease to follow, and the ones after that, before we embrace the newly invented tort of clergy malpractice.\u201d Id. at 328.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-7\">Courts in other jurisdictions have recognized additional barriers to claims of clergy malpractice. The Ohio Supreme Court summarized some of them in <em>Strock v. Pressnell, supra </em>527 <em>N.E.2d </em>at 1239:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b301-8\">The reluctance of courts to embrace the tort of clergy malpractice may be attributed to the many, and often complex, questions that arise under it. For example, what exactly are the \u201cprofessional services\u201d rendered by a cleric? And does the standard of the professional vary with the ecclesiastical office? In other words, is a rabbi, priest, pastor, or lay elder held to the same standard of care regardless of training or wide variances in the authority and obligation of religious offices? Also, where a \u201cprofessional service,\u201d such as the marriage counseling involved in this case, is not unique to the cleric, should the eleric be held to the same duty of care as secular counselors?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b301-9\">\n<em>[Ibid.]</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b302-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>We do not minimize these concerns. They appear, however, to present problems of proof and definition which should not be addressed on a motion to dismiss under <em>R. </em>4:6-2(e), but rather, should await resolution on a more fully informed record.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-5\">Ultimately, the court in <em>Strock </em>rejected plaintiffs clergy malpractice claims because \u201c[mjalpractice ... is not a theory of ordinary negligence or of intentional tort. It is a separate and distinct cause of action.\u201d <em>Strock, supra, </em>527 <em>N.E.</em>2d at 1239. To be recognized, clergy malpractice \u201cmust fall outside the scope of other recognized torts.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>The court held that the alleged acts of the defendant \u201cfell within the realm of intentional tort law,\u201d and, therefore, were not actionable as malpractice. <em>Ibid. </em>The court then reasoned that the intentional tort alleged in the complaint was an amatory action, such as alienation of affection and seduction, which the Ohio Legislature had abolished. <em>Id. </em>at 1240. The court concluded, therefore, that plaintiff\u2019s cause of action for intentional infliction of emotional distress could not be maintained. <em>Id. </em>at 1243. The court, for the same reason, ruled that a cause of action for breach of a fiduciary duty was not viable. <em>Id. </em>at 1243-44.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-6\">In New Jersey we have no rule that requires a cause of action to \u201cfall outside the scope of other recognized torts\u201d before it may be maintained. To the contrary, our rules permit the pleading of alternative causes of action \u201cregardless of their consistency.\u201d <em>R. </em>4:5-6. <em>See Burd v. Sussex Mutual Ins. Co., </em>56 <em>N.J. </em>383, 267 A.2d 7 (1970). In any event, as previously indicated, an action for malpractice is, at its core, a negligence action.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-7\"><em>Sanders v. Casa View Baptist Church, </em>898 <em>F.Supp. </em>1169 (N.D.Tex.1995), is another example of judicial reluctance to entertain a claim for clergy malpractice. In that case, the court denied a minister\u2019s motion for summary judgment. Ruling that plaintiffs could not maintain a claim based on clergy malpractice, the court construed the claim as one for \u201cprofessional malpractice by a marriage counselor, not clergy malpractice.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1175. The action was deemed to be maintainable under that rubric.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>Finally, in <em>DeBose v. Bear Valley Church of Christ, supra, </em>890 P.2d 214, the court rejected a claim based on clergy malpractice because such a course of action would require the promulgation of standards against which a cleric\u2019s performance would be measured. The court stated that \u201c[t]o attempt to require members of the clergy to comply with such a standard, however, could very well restrict their right freely to exercise and practice their religion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 225.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-6\">New Jersey courts have recognized causes of action for professional negligence against chiropractors, <em>Rosenberg by Rosenberg v. Cahill, </em>99 <em>N.J. </em>318, 492 A.2d 371 (1985), accountants, <em>Rosenblum v. Adler, </em>93 <em>N.J. </em>324, 461 A.2d 138 (1983), and real estate brokers, <em>Paris of Wayne v. Richard </em>A. <em>Hajjar Agency, </em>174 <em>N.J.Super. </em>310, 416 A.2d 436 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>85 <em>N.J. </em>454, 427 A.2d 555 (1980); <em>Sullivan v. Jefferson, Jefferson &amp; Vaida, </em>167 <em>N.J.Super. </em>282, 400 A.2d 836 (App.Div.1979). We perceive no impenetrable barrier, on the limited record before us, to establishing a standard of care applicable to cleric-counselors in the context of an allegation that the counselor used his position to sexually exploit the counselee. <em>Cf. Simmons v. United States, </em>805 <em>F.</em>2d 1363, 1365 (9th Cir.1986) (affirming judgment based on sexual exploitation of plaintiff by a social worker-counselor, discussing the \u201ctransference phenomenon\u201d and noting that \u201c[wjhen the therapist mishandles transference and becomes sexually involved with a patient, medical authorities are nearly unanimous in considering such conduct to be malpractice\u201d); <em>Corgan v. Muehling, </em>143 <em>Ill.2d </em>296, <em>158 Ill.Dec. </em>489, 574 <em>N.E.2d </em>602 (1991) (holding that complaint stated cause of action for negligence arising from psychologist\u2019s engaging in relations with plaintiff during course of treatment); <em>N.J.AC. </em>13:42-10.9 (prohibiting a psychologist licensed in New Jersey from engaging in sexual relations \u201cwith a current psychotherapy client, a former client, ... a current student, a direct supervisee or supervisor, or a research participant,\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b303-7\">Whether plaintiff can establish an applicable standard of care, show that MacDonell breached this standard, and prove the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>damages proximately flowing from that breach, are all issues of proof which cannot be determined on a motion for judgment on the pleadings. <em>Cf. Simmons v. United States, supra, </em>805 P.2d at 1366 (suggesting a distinction between a therapist-patient relationship and sexual involvement of a minister with a parishioner because the minister \u201cdoes not offer a course of counselling predicated upon handling the transference phenomenon.\u201d) (citing A. Stone, M.D., <em>Law, Psychiatry, and Morality </em>199 (1984)).</p>\n<p id=\"b304-5\">Finally, we note again that this is a case of first impression in New Jersey. We also note that issues regarding inappropriate sexual behavior by clerics are matters of current public concern. We are persuaded that those issues should not be addressed except on a well-informed record. <em>See Jackson v. Muhlenberg Hospital, </em>53 <em>N.J. </em>138, 142, 249 A.2d 65 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b304-6\">Although defendant Harper was not sexually involved \u25a0with plaintiff, the trial court treated Count IX, alleging breaeh of a fiduciary, as a malpractice count and dismissed it on that basis. For the reasons expressed above, we conclude that the court erred in dismissing this \u201cmalpractice\u201d count. We do not, however, foreclose the trial court, as the record develops below, from treating the fiduciary duty counts as stating causes of action separate and distinct from negligence-malpractice. <em>See Moses v. Diocese of Colorado, supra, </em>863 P.2d 310; <em>Destefano v. Grabrian, supra, </em>763 P.2d 275.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-7\">The order dismissing all counts against MacDonell and Count IX against Harper is reversed and the case is remanded for further proceedings.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b299-11\"> In footnote 4 of the <em>Dausch </em>opinion, 52 F.3d at 1432, the court of appeals lists state court decisions rejecting clergy malpractice.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
