The trial court\u2019s opinion is published at 273 <em>N.J.Super. </em>388, 641 A.2d 1136 (Law Div.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b457-9\">We now affirm the summary judgment substantially for the reasons expressed by the trial court in section I of its opinion. Section II of the opinion addresses the substance of plaintiffs claim against the bank for paying forged or altered checks. That section of the opinion is dictum because those claims were not properly before the trial court. The trial court had denied plaintiffs motion to amend its complaint to assert a cause of action based on the bank\u2019s payment of forged instruments. We affirm the order denying plaintiff leave to amend, as we perceive no mistaken exercise of discretion in that regard. <em>See Fisher v. Yates, </em>270 <em>N.J.Super. </em>458, 467, 637 A.2d 546 (App.Div.1994); <em>DuWel Products, Inc. v. United States Fire Ins. Co., </em>236 <em>N.J.Super. </em>349, 364, 565 A.2d 1113 (App.Div.1989), <em>certif. denied, </em>121 <em>N.J. </em>617, 583 A.2d 316 (1990). Plaintiffs motion was made on the eve of trial and almost three years after the complaint was filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-10\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
