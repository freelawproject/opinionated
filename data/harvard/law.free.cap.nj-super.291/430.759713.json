LEVY, J.A.D.</author>\n<p id=\"b460-13\"><em>N.J.S.A </em>17:29A-35(b) establishes a Merit Rating Plan under which the New Jersey Division of Motor Vehicles (DMV), levies <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>surcharges each year on drivers who have accumulated six or more points on or after February 10, 1983, in the amount of $100 plus $25 for each point over six. Drivers convicted of operating a motor vehicle under the influence of liquor or drugs <em>(N.J.S.A </em>39:4-50) or refusing to submit to a chemical test <em>(N.J.S.A. </em>39:4-50.4a) are surcharged $1000 for the first two convictions and $1500 for the third, each year for three years. DMV remits the funds it collects to the New Jersey Automobile Insurance Guaranty Fund <em>(N.J.S.A </em>17:33B-5) to be transferred to the Market Transition Facility Revenue Fund <em>(N.J.S.A </em>34:1B-21.12). In 1994 <em>N.J.S.A </em>17:29A-35 was amended to authorize the Director of DMV to issue a certificate of debt to the Clerk of the Superior Court, when a driver fails to pay a surcharge. The docketing of the certificate \u201cshall have the same force and effect as a civil judgment,\u201d with all the remedies and proceedings for collection, \u201cbut without prejudice to any right of appeal.\u201d <em>L. </em>1994, c. 64, \u00a7 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-6\">Defendant Louis Caruso accrued over $14,000 of surcharges since 1985, and DMV utilized this procedure in order to collect the accruals, with due notice to defendant. Defendant moved to set aside the resulting judgment, and appeals from the denial of his motion. He contends that: DMV should be estopped from arguing that the surcharges constituted a debt, since it previously contended that surcharges were not a debt in a bankruptcy ease;<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the amendment of <em>N.J.S.A </em>17:29A-35 should not be applied retroactively; the amendment constituted an <em>ex post facto </em>law and imposed double jeopardy; and the amendment violated defendant\u2019s right <em>to </em>due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-7\">Defendant has frequently violated the statutes regulating traffic and driver licensing. He accumulated forty-seven points from 1979 to 1983, from eleven offenses for speeding, two for disregarding stop signs, and one for failing to observe a traffic control <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>device. One of Ms speeding violations was for driving eighty-four mules per hour in a forty-mile-per-hour zone. Defendant was involved in four accidents in 1980, 1981 and 1984. At the time of the 1984 accident, he refused to submit to a chemical test, and his license was suspended for tMs violation. Nevertheless, defendant operated a veMcle while suspended and while intoxicated in 1985, 1987, and 1990; he was convicted of each violation and Ms license was again suspended. The latest suspension was for ten years.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-4\">In addition to the suspensions, DMV assessed insurance surcharges against defendant for his various offenses every year from 1984 through 1994, except . 1991, pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>17:29A-35, and sent him bills for the amounts due. Defendant paid only his 1984 surcharge; the balance due on the unpaid surcharges was $15,100 as of October 2, 1994. Each time defendant faded to pay his surcharge, DMV suspended his driving privilege.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-5\">On October 2, 1994, DMV issued and sent defendant a \u201cProposed Notice of Judgment,\u201d advising that since defendant\u2019s driving privilege was suspended and since he operated a veMcle during the suspension period, \u201cwe now have the authority to impose a judgment against you pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>17:29A-33.\u201d The notice gave defendant the option to pay the amount due ($15,100) in one lump sum or in five montMy installments. If no payment was received by November 1, 1994, DMV stated it would file a certificate of debt with the Superior Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-6\">On the back of its notice, DMV explained that once it filed the certificate of debt, it \u201cmay take judgment action against you and collect the surcharge debt through involuntary means,\u201d including liens against real property and garnishment of salary. DMV advised defendant that he was \u201cnot entitled to a hearing in regard to this notice as you have exhausted your right to appeal the billings on wMch tMs notice is based.\u201d However, DMV gave defendant an address and phone number to report any. \u201cerror regarding a surchargeable offense on your driving record.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b462-7\">On October 7, 1994, defendant\u2019s attorney wrote to DMV, questioning its authority to impose judgment, and questioning the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>violations for operating a vehicle during a suspension period. Defendant did not otherwise dispute the $15,100 due. DMV responded on October 20, 1994, citing <em>N.J.S.A. </em>17:29A-35 for its authority. DMV also reduced the amount due by $750 since an April 14, 1991, violation for driving while suspended was not surchargeable.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-6\">On December 6 and 14, 1994, DMV\u2019s collection attorney wrote to defendant advising that the judgment against him had been docketed and that he now owed $17,253.40 as of December 6 and $17,268.43 as of December 14.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On January 6, 1995, DMV\u2019s attorney issued defendant an \u201cInformation Subpoena and Written Questions\u201d asking about his assets and income.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-7\">Defendant moved to set aside the judgment and quash the subpoena. The motion judge denied the motion, but stayed compliance with the subpoena pending appeal, finding that the filing of an ex parte certificate of debt did not violate due process, since it was \u201ca mere additional collection method,\u201d there was notification that it would be filed, and there was a right to appeal. He agreed with DMV that the entry of the judgment did not constitute a new liability, but was an \u201cenforcement tool.\u201d He rejected defendant\u2019s argument that the new collection scheme changed payment of surcharges from voluntary, as a condition to the driving privilege, to mandatory. The judge reasoned that since the entry of the judgment was neither a second judgment for the same offense nor punitive in nature, it did not constitute double jeopardy or an <em>ex post facto </em>law.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-8\">/.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-9\">Defendant argues that DMV should be judicially estopped from asserting that the surcharges imposed under <em>N.J.S.A. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>17:29A-35 constitute a debt, since DMV took the position that the surcharges were not a debt in a prior bankruptcy case, <em>Lugo v. Paulsen, </em>886 <em>F.2d </em>602 (3d Cir.1989). Prior to 1994, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>17:29A~35 contained the following with respect to the surcharge scheme under the New Jersey Merit Rating Plan:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b464-4\">There is created a New Jersey Merit Rating Plan which shall apply to all drivers and shall include, but not be limited to, the following provisions:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b464-5\">(1) (a) Plan surcharges shall be levied, beginning on or after January 1, 1984, by the Division of Motor Vehicles on any driver who has accumulated, within the immediately preceding three year period, beginning on or after February 10,1983, six or more motor vehicle points, as provided in Title 39 of the Revised Statutes, exclusive of any points for convictions for which surcharges are levied under paragraph (2) of this subsection;____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b464-7\">(2) Plan surcharges shall be levied for convictions (a) under <em>R.S. </em>39:4-60 for violations occurring on or after February 10, 1983 and (b) under <em>[N.J.S.A. </em>39:4-50.4a] ... for violations occurring on or after January 26,1984.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b464-8\">If, upon written notification from the Division of Motor Vehicles, mailed to the last address of record with the division, a driver fails to pay a surcharge levied under this subsection, the license of the driver shall be suspended forthwith until the surcharge is paid to the Division of Motor Vehicles;____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b464-10\">[L. 1990, c. 8, \u00a7 35.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b464-11\">The 1994 amendment added the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b464-12\">If a driver fails to pay the surcharge or any installments on the surcharge, the total surcharge shall become due immediately.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b464-13\">In addition to any other remedy provided by law, the director is authorized to utilize the provisions of the SOIL (Setoff of Individual Liability) program established pursuant to P.L.1981, c. 239 (C. 54A:9-8.1 et seq.) to collect any surcharge levied under this section that is unpaid on or after the effective date of this act. As an additional remedy, the director may issue a certificate to the Clerk of the Superior Court stating that the person identified in the certificate is indebted under this surcharge law in such amount as shall be stated in the certificate. The certificate shall reference the statute under which the indebtedness arises. Thereupon the clerk to whom such certificate shall have been issued shall immediately enter upon the record of docketed judgments the name of such person as debtor; the State as creditor; the address of such person, if shown in the certificate; the amount of the debt so certified; a reference to the statute under which the surcharge is assessed, and the date of making such entries. The docketing of the entries shall have the same force and effect as a civil judgment docketed in the Superior Court, and the director shall have all the remedies and may take all of the proceedings for the collection thereof which may be had or taken upon the recovery of a judgment in an action, but without prejudice to any right of appeal____ The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>director shall provide written notification to a driver of the proposed filing of the certificate of debt 10 days prior to the proposed filing; such notice shall be mailed to the driver\u2019s last address of record with the division.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b465-6\">[L. 1994, c. 64, \u00a7 l.J</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b465-7\">In Lugo <em>v. Paulsen, supra, </em>886 F.2d at 603, argued and decided prior to the 1994 amendment, the issue was whether an insurance surcharge, levied by plaintiff under this provision, constituted a debt under the Bankruptcy Code, and if so, whether it was dischargeable under Chapter 7. Paulsen, then the DMV Director argued, and the Bankruptcy Court agreed, that the surcharge was \u201can additional premium required for future liability insurance and, as such, it would not qualify as a debt incurred pre-petition.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 605. The Third Circuit disagreed, noting that the definition of debt in the Bankruptcy Code, a \u201cliability on a claim,\u201d 11 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 101(11), should be liberally interpreted. <em>Id. </em>at 605. The court reasoned that the surcharge was not an additional premium for future insurance coverage, since the debtor did not own an automobile and thus was not required to carry insurance. <em>Id. </em>at 606.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-8\">The DMV further argued that the surcharge did not constitute a debt \u201cbecause it cannot be reduced to a money judgment and therefore does not constitute a \u2018right to payment\u2019 under the definition of claim in 11 <em>U.S.C. </em>\u00a7 101(4)(A).\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>The court also rejected this argument, since the statutory provision for suspension of the driver\u2019s license was an adequate enforcement mechanism. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b465-9\">Success in the prior proceeding is a prerequisite for the application of the doctrine of judicial estoppel. In <em>Chattin v. Cape May Greene, Inc., </em>243 <em>N.J.Super. </em>590, 620, 581 A.2d 91 (App.Div. 1990), <em>aff'd o.b., </em>124 <em>N.J. </em>520, 591 A.2d 943 (1991), we did not bar homeowners from seeking to confirm a prior arbitration award. Although they had previously asserted that the arbitration award was not binding, they were \u201cwholly unsuccessful\u201d in that assertion. <em>Ibid.; see also State v. Gonzalez, </em>273 <em>N.J.Super. </em>239, 256-57, 641 A.2d 1060 (App.Div.1994), <em>aff'd o.b., </em>142 <em>N.J. </em>618, 667 A.2d 684 (1995) (Skillman, J.A.D., dissenting) (noting the requirement of success in the prior proceeding, despite the contrary holding of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number><em>Levin v. Robinson, Wayne, and LaSala, Esqs., </em>246 <em>N.J.Super. </em>167, 586 A.2d 1348 (Law Div.1990)).</p>\n<p id=\"b466-4\">Here, DMV did not succeed in <em>Lugo </em>(the prior proceeding). The Third Circuit rejected its position that the surcharge was a debt. Thus, the judge did not abuse his discretion in failing to preclude DMV from taking a contrary position here. Further, one of the bases for plaintiffs argument in <em>Lugo </em>was the absence of an enforcement procedure. 886 F.2d at 606. However, the 1994 amendment has now established such an enforcement procedure. Thus, DMV has changed its argument in accordance with the change in the statute. Moreover, its positions are based on different legal rather than factual positions. Whether a surcharge under the statute is a debt is a legal determination. Here, as in <em>American Employers\u2019 Ins. Co. v. Elf Atochem N. Am., Inc., </em>280 <em>N.J.Super. </em>601, 611, 656 A.2d 58 (App.Div.1995), there was an intervening change in the law: the amendment to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>17:29A-35.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-5\">Finally, we agree with DMV that defendant\u2019s actions should be considered. The application of judicial estoppel is discretionary, depending upon the merits of each case. <em>Levin, supra, </em>246 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 184, 586 A.2d 1348. Defendant argues that he may avoid paying the surcharges if he chooses to forfeit his driving privilege. However, he has continued to drive, not only while his driving privilege was suspended, but further while intoxicated on three occasions in 1985, 1987 and 1990. His accumulation of points, involvement in accidents, and driving while intoxicated show that he is a most unsafe driver and that he has flaunted laws which attempt to protect the public safety on the roads. It would be unjust to apply the doctrine of judicial estoppel in the face of Caruso\u2019s conduct. The judge did not abuse his discretion in failing to preclude DMV from arguing that the surcharges constituted a debt.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-6\">\n<em>II.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AbYY\">Defendant contends that the collection scheme authorized by the 1994 amendment to <em>N.J.S.A </em>17:29A-35 should be applied <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>prospectively, only to surcharges imposed after the effective date of the amendment. He argues that the retroactive application of the amendment to him violates his right to due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-5\">The amendment specifies that DMV may utilize the Setoff of Individual Liability program \u201cto collect any surcharge levied under this section that is unpaid on or after the effective date of this act.\u201d <em>L. </em>1994, c. 64, \u00a7 1. The procedure for issuing, recording, and docketing the certificate of debt as a judgment follows, \u201c[a]s an additional remedy.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Thus, the amendment applies to all surcharges that are unpaid as of its effective date, June 30, 1994. <em>Ibid. </em>In addition, the Statement accompanying S. 1148, which became <em>L. </em>1994, c. 64, \u00a7 1, indicates that the purpose of the bill was to collect surcharges then due but not paid.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-6\">Defendant further contends that this retroactive application of the amendment violates his right to due process. He cites <em>Phillips v. Curiale, </em>128 <em>N.J. </em>608, 620, 608 A.2d 895 (1992), in which the Court explained that retroactive application of a statute violates due process if it interferes with \u201cvested rights\u201d or is \u201cmanifestly unjust.\u201d A vested right is \u201ca present fixed interest\u201d; it is more than simply the continuance of present law. <em>Ibid., </em>quoting <em>Pennsylvania Greyhound Lines, Inc. v. Rosenthal, </em>14 <em>N.J. </em>372, 384, 102 A.2d 587 (1954). The determination of whether there was a \u201cmanifest injustice\u201d requires a weighing of the public interest in the retroactive application of the statute against the affected party\u2019s reliance on the previous law, and the consequences of that reliance. <em>Id. </em>at 625, 608 A.2d 895.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-7\">Here, defendant claims that his vested right was his \u201celection available under the prior statute to not seek renewal of his driving privileges.\u201d He claims that the manifest injustice was the reclassification of the surcharge as a retroactive debt. To the contrary, we conclude there was no reclassification of the surcharge as a debt. It was always a debt, as the court held in <em>Lugo, supra, </em>886 <em>F.</em>2d at 604-07. DMV had no \u201cpresent fixed interest\u201d in avoiding payment of the surcharges levied against him. <em>Phillips, supra, </em>128 <em>N.J. </em>at 620, 608 A.2d 895. He simply anticipated continuance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>of the then-current law. <em>Ibid. </em>Moreover, as the DMV points out, although he was unable to renew his driving privilege, he continued to drive illegally with impunity. This is precisely the problem which the Legislature intended <em>L. </em>1994, c. 64, \u00a7 1 to correct, and the collection of surcharges due does not constitute any manifest injustice or violation of any vested right.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-4\">The 1994 amendment did not change any substantive liability. Rather, it established new remedies for the collection of surcharges. The public policy in favor of funding the New Jersey Automobile Insurance Guaranty Fund, so that claims can be paid in accordance with the Fair Automobile Insurance Reform Act of 1990, <em>N.J.S.A </em>17:33B-1 to -63, outweighs the burden on defendant. Requiring defendant to finally pay the surcharges which he owes is not particularly harsh and oppressive, and does not defeat his reasonable expectations. There was no violation of his right to due process here.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-5\">\n<em>III.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b468-6\">We have carefully reviewed defendant\u2019s arguments claiming the 1994 amendment is an <em>ex post facto </em>law, that it constitutes double jeopardy by imposing a new penalty for a prior offense, and that the 1994 amendment and the docketing of the judgment against him violated the basic elements of procedural due process. We conclude those arguments are clearly without merit. <em>R. </em>2:11 \u2014 3(e)(1)(E). <em>See Clark v. N.J. Div. Motor Vehicles, </em>211 <em>N.J.Super. </em>708, 711, 512 A.2d 588 (App.Div.1986) (imposition of these surcharges was not punitive in nature); <em>Doe v. Poritz, </em>142 <em>N.J. </em>1, 47, 662 A.2d 367 (1995) (legislation that is punishment for purpose of the <em>ex post facto </em>clause is also punishment for purpose of the double jeopardy clause). As to defendant\u2019s due process claims, he admits he received notice of the filing of the certificate of debt, and the record supports the DMV position that defendant was notified of his right to a hearing on every surcharge bill but he never asked for one. <em>See New York, Susquehanna and Western R.R. Co. v. Vermeulen, </em>44 <em>N.J. </em>491, 501, 210 A.2d 214 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>(1965) <em>(N.J.S.A </em>54:29A-57 did not deny procedural due process in providing for docketing of certificate of debt to collect tax owed by railroad).</p>\n<p id=\"b469-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b461-8\"> That case involved a defendant other than Caruso. <em>See Lugo </em>v. <em>Paulsen, </em>886 <em>F.2d 602 </em>(3d Cir.1989).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b463-10\"><em> N.J.S.A. </em>17:29A-35 authorizes a fee of 20% \"in lieu of the actual cost of collection\u201d if further action to collect is required after the certificate of debt is entered. After $750 is deducted from the $15,100 due, and twenty percent is added, the amount due would be $17,220.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
