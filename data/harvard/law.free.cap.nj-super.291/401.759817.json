The application, made pursuant to the Prevention of Domestic Violence Act of 1991(Act), <em>see </em>N.J.S.A 2C:25-21d(3), was denied by the Family Part Judge on the ground that the court lacked jurisdiction because an underlying domestic violence complaint had been dismissed. In addition, the judge concluded that relief was not warranted because the State had neither produced a subpoenaed, material witness (Mrs. Volpini) to testify at the forfeiture hearing nor complied with the fifteen-day hearing requirement of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:25-21d(3). On appeal, the State argues that the judge erred in declining to hear the State\u2019s timely filed weapons forfeiture application and in ordering the immediate return of defendant\u2019s weapons.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-7\">\n<em>I.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b431-8\">The events leading up to the forfeiture application commenced on February 26, 1995, when Manalapan Township police responded to a domestic violence call made by Mr. Volpini\u2019s wife from the couple\u2019s home. She claimed that her husband had physically assaulted her, which was partially corroborated by a bruise on her left cheek. Although Mrs. Volpini refused to file a complaint or seek a temporary restraining order (TRO) against her husband, a police officer arrested Mr. Volpini for simple assault and seized his Browning 12-gauge shotgun, his Marlin .22 caliber rifle, and a bag of ammunition.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-9\">Mrs. Volpini went to the police department the following day to report that her husband had since telephoned her six times at her place of employment, threatening to kill her and their son \u201cif he did not straighten out his problem and get his guns back.\u201d She indicated that her husband had been undergoing psychiatric treatment and taking medication for depression. These charges result<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>ed in Mr. Volpini\u2019s arrest on a charge of terroristic threats.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In addition, Mrs. Volpini signed a domestic violence complaint against her husband.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-5\">Upon issuance of an ea; <em>parte </em>TRO pursuant to her complaint, Mr. Volpini was notified to appear for a final hearing on his wife\u2019s application for restraints. The TRO directed him to turn over to the police a Ruger .357 Magnum handgun and \u201cpossibly one rifle.\u201d The police seized from the Volpini home the handgun, a Remington .308 caliber rifle, and another bag of ammunition. At a March 7, 1995 final hearing, the domestic violence complaint was dismissed after Mrs. Volpini had requested its withdrawal; the TRO was also vacated.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-6\">The Monmouth County Prosecutor moved the next day for forfeiture of Mr. Volpini\u2019s weapons and revocation of his weapons permits and licenses. The motion was filed within \u201c45 days of seizure,\u201d as required by the first unnumbered paragraph of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:25-21(d)(3), but was not calendared for argument until May 25, 1995. The State\u2019s application was twice adjourned at Mr. Volpini\u2019s request. The State then sought the adjournment of a September 14, 1995 hearing because Mrs. Volpini failed to appear. The prosecutor maintained that the State had mailed a subpoena to her and \u201chad anticipated calling her as a hostile witness.\u201d The State was nonetheless prepared to examine the two police officers who had answered the original domestic violence call.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-7\">At a September 21, 1995 proceeding, the State sought another adjournment because it had been unable to personally serve Mrs. Volpini with a second subpoena. Mr. Volpini advised the police officers who had attempted to serve the subpoena that his wife had left the jurisdiction. The State informed the judge that it was nevertheless prepared to proceed with its case in her absence. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>The judge questioned, however, whether he had jurisdiction to hear the motion because Mrs. Volpini\u2019s domestic violence complaint had been dismissed. He relied upon the decision in <em>State v. Warrick, </em>283 <em>N.J.Super. </em>169, 661 A.2d 335 (Ch.Div.1995), which held that a weapons forfeiture action may not proceed if the domestic violence complaint upon which the motion is based has been dismissed. Mr. Volpini\u2019s defense was equally predicated upon the State\u2019s failure to produce the testimony of the complaining witness and to hold the forfeiture hearing within fifteen days of the State\u2019s notification of the defendant of its intention to seek forfeiture. Concluding that the mandatory language of the fourth unnumbered paragraph of <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:25-21d(3) denied the court jurisdiction, the judge dismissed the motion and ordered the return of the defendant\u2019s weapons upon finding that each of the aforementioned arguments was fatal to the State\u2019s cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-6\">\n<em>II.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b433-7\"><em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:25-21d(3), the statute at issue in the instant appeal, states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b433-8\">Weapons seized in accordance with the above <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> shall be returned to the owner except upon order of the Superior Court. The prosecutor who has possession of the seized weapons may, upon notice to the owner, petition a judge of the Family Part of the Superior Court, Chancery Division, within 45 days of seizure, to obtain title to the seized weapons, or to revoke any and all permits, licenses and other authorizations for the use, possession, or ownership of such weapons pursuant to the law governing such use, possession, or ownership, or may object to the return of the weapons on such grounds as are provided for the initial rejection or later revocation of the authorizations, or on the grounds that the owner is unfit or that the owner poses a threat to the public in general or a person or persons in particular.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b433-9\">A hearing shall be held and a record made thereof within 15 days of the notice provided above____ The hearing shall be summary in nature. Appeals from the results of the hearing shall be to the Superior Court, Appellate Division, in accordance with the law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b434-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>If the prosecutor does not institute an action within 45 days of seizure, the seized weapons shall be returned to the owner.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b434-5\">After the hearing the court shall order the return of the firearms, weapons and any authorization papers relating to the seized weapons to the owner if the complaint has been dismissed at the request of the complainant and the prosecutor determines that there is insufficient probable cause to indict; or if the defendant is found not guilty of the charges; or if the court determines that the domestic violence situation no longer exists.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b434-6\">Nothing in this act shall impair the right of the State to retain evidence pending a criminal prosecution. Nor sh\u00e1ll any provision of this act be construed to limit the authority of the State or a law enforcement officer to seize, retain or forfeit property pursuant to chapter 64 of Title 2C of the New Jersey Statutes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b434-7\">********</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b434-8\">In <em>State v. Warrick, supra, </em>283 <em>N.J.Super. </em>169, 661 A.2d 335, the Family Part considered the relationship of the component parts of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:25-21d(3). On two occasions, Mrs. Warrick had filed domestic violence complaints and obtained orders compelling the seizure of her husband\u2019s weapons. <em>Id. </em>at 171-172, 661 A.2d 335. The State unsuccessfully moved both times for forfeiture of those weapons despite the fact that the complaints were dismissed at the complainant\u2019s request. <em>Id. </em>at 171-172, 180, 661 A.2d 335.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-9\">The State\u2019s second forfeiture motion was premised upon the classification of Mr. Warrick as one who \u201c \u2018poses a threat to the public in general or a person or persons in particular.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 173, 661 A2d 335; <em>see N.J.S.A. </em>2C:25-21d(3). However, the motion judge in <em>Warrick </em>found it \u201cdifficult to locate a consistent philosophy between [the provisions of the first and fourth unnumbered paragraphs of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:25-21d(3) ].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 175, 661 A.2d 335. Whereas the first paragraph empowers a prosecutor to object to the return of weapons, the judge explained that the fourth paragraph declares that a court, upon hearing, \u201c <em>\u2018shall </em>order the return\u2019 of the weapons if any one of a number of events has occurred.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 175-176, 661 A.2d 335.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-10\"><em>Warrick </em>concluded that the mandatory duty imposed upon the court by the fourth paragraph overrode the permissive authority to seek forfeiture granted to the prosecutor by the first paragraph. Reasoning that he was obligated to order the return of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>Mr. Warrick\u2019s weapons if any of three circumstances set forth in the fourth paragraph existed,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the judge denied the State\u2019s motion on the ground that the occurrence of the first and third circumstances \u201cnegate[d][any] consideration of whether [Warrick] \u2018poses a threat\u2019[ ] or any other disability mentioned in the first paragraph of <em>[N.J.S.A </em>2C:25-21d(3) ].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 179-180, 661 A.2d 335 (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b435-6\">Resolution of the apparent internal inconsistency analyzed in <em>Warrick </em>necessitates our discernment of legislative intent respecting <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:25-21d(3), taking into account the policy underlying the Act. <em>T.S.R. v. J.C., </em>288 <em>N.J.Super. </em>48, 53, 671 A.2d 1068 (App.Div.1996); <em>Carfagno v. Carfagno, </em>288 <em>N.J.Super. </em>424, 435, 672 A.2d 751 (Ch.Div.1995). In this regard, our function is twofold: \u201cto \u2018effectuate the legislative intent in light of the language used and the objects sought to be achieved,\u2019 ... and to construe [the Act] in a fashion consistent with the statutory context in which it appears____\u201d <em>In re Rehabilitation of Mut. Ben. Life Ins. Co., </em>258 <em>N.J.Super. </em>356, 375, 609 A.2d 768 (App.Div. 1992) (citations and internal citations omitted); <em>see Fiore v. Consol. Freightways, </em>140 <em>N.J. </em>452, 466, 659 A.2d 436 (1995) (\u201cOur task is to harmonize the individual sections and read the statute in the way that is most consistent with the overall legislative intent.\u201d). \u201cWhen a statute includes provisions which appear inconsistent,\u201d we have looked to the purpose of the act as a guide for our ascertainment of the underlying legislative intent. <em>T.S.R. v. J.C., supra, </em>288 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 54, 671 A.2d 1068.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-9\">Within another domestic violence context, we have undertaken a pragmatic approach in construing <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:25-21d(3):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b436-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>A statute should not be given an arbitrary construction, according to the strict letter, but rather one that will advance the sense and meaning fairly deducible from the context. The reason of the statute prevails over the literal sense of the terms; the obvious policy is an implied limitation on the sense of the general terms, and a touchstone for the expansion of narrower terms.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b436-5\"><em>[State v. Saavedra, </em>276 <em>N.J.Super. </em>289, 294, 647 A.2d 1348 (App.Div.1994) (quoting <em>Wene v. Meyner, </em>13 <em>N.J. </em>185, 197, 98 A.2d 573 (1953)); <em>see T.S.R. v.

Blair, </em>60 <em>N.J. </em>330, 339, 288 A.2d 855 (1972)); <em>see Fulginiti v.

To avoid an outcome here that is at odds with the legislative intent of the Act, we strive to read its various sections as \u201ccohesively and harmoniously\u201d as possible. <em>Woodcock v. Calabrese, </em>148 <em>N.J.Super. </em>526, 535, 372 A.2d 1178 (Dist. Ct.1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b436-7\">The Legislature has expressed the purpose of the Act in clear and unmistakable terms.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>See N.J.S.A </em>2C:25-18. Simply put, \u201c[t]he policy of the Act is to provide broad protection for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>victim\u201d of domestic violence.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>Carfagno v. Carfagno, supra, </em>288 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 436, 672 A.2d 751 (citing <em>N.J.S.A. </em>20:25-18); <em>see State v. Saavedra, supra, </em>276 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 292, 647 A.2d 1348, (\u201cProtection of the victim was the clear and unequivocal message.\u201d). Our interpretation of the Act has been guided by this overriding goal.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>In <em>State v. Saavedra, supra, </em>276 <em>N.J.Super. </em>289, 647 A.2d 1348, for example, we upheld the denial of a motion to dismiss a forfeiture proceeding in order to allow the Family Part to reach the merits of the State\u2019s motion. Following the filing of a domestic violence complaint and the issuance of a TRO against him, local police had confiscated Saav\u00e9dra\u2019s 9 MM Berretta. The State did not move for forfeiture under <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:25-21d(3) until 150 days after the seizure, however, even though the complainant had also signed a contempt complaint against the defendant for violation of a restraining order. Despite the State\u2019s non-adherence to the 45-day hearing requirement imposed by the third unnumbered paragraph of <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:25-21d(3), the judge denied the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss. 276 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 291, 647 A.2d 1348.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-5\">We decided in <em>Saavedra </em>that the police had ignored the \u201cstatutory command\u201d of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:25-21d(3) by withholding the seized weapon in conformity with a Family Part order instead of forwarding it to the prosecutor. In our view, however, the statutory window for seeking forfeiture \u201cpresuppose[d] that the prosecutor has possession of the seized weapon.\u201d 276 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 293, 647 A.2d 1348. The prosecutor was thus not held to the statutory timetable because he did not possess the weapon. <em>Id. </em>at 293-294, 647 A.2d 1348. The principle of statutory construction underlying <em>Saavedra </em>is that \u201c \u201cwhere a literal rendering of a statute will lead to a result not in accord with the essential purpose and design of the act, the spirit of the law will control the letter.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Tekel, </em>281 <em>N.J.Super. </em>502, 506, 658 A.2d 1281 (App.Div.1995) (quoting <em>New Jersey Builders, Owners &amp; Managers Ass\u2019n v. Blair, supra, </em>60 <em>N.J. </em>at 338, 288 A.2d 855).</p>\n<p id=\"b438-6\">The State argues that the motion judge\u2019s decision here was based upon a \u201cnarrow interpretation\u201d of jurisdiction that \u201cis contrary to the intent of the Legislature\u201d to afford maximum protection to victims of domestic violence by empowering law enforcement to seize weapons in situations giving rise to a reasonable belief that such firearms pose a serious risk of harm. <em>See </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number><em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:25-21d(l). The State asserts that subjecting the exercise of prosecutorial authority to a victim\u2019s decision to seek dismissal of a filed domestic violence complaint would defeat that legislative purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-6\">Defendant contends that he qualifies for the return of his weapons under each of the three alternative circumstances identified in the fourth paragraph of <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:25-21d(3). First, his wife sought and obtained the dismissal of the complaint and the TRO entered against him. Second, the municipal court complaint was dismissed. Finally, no court has found that he committed an act of domestic violence. In light of the purportedly unambiguous language of the fourth paragraph of <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:25-21d(3), Mr. Volpini insists that the State is obligated to return his weapons.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-7\">The most appropriate construction of <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:25-21d(3) is one harmonizing apparent conflicts between and among its component parts in advancement of the Act\u2019s overriding purpose. <em>See Woodcock v. Calabrese, supra, </em>148 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 535, 372 A.2d 1178. The Legislature has left little doubt as to that \u201cuseful and consistent purpose,\u201d <em>State v. Vonderfecht, </em>284 <em>N.J.Super. </em>555, 559, 665 A.2d 1145 (App.Div.1995): \u201cto assure the victims of domestic violence the <em>maximum protection </em>from abuse the law can provide,\u201d <em>N.J.S.A </em>20:25-18 (emphasis supplied). <em>See State v. Saavedra, supra, </em>276 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 292, 647 A.2d 1348; <em>Carfagno v. Carfagno, supra, </em>288 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 436, 672 A.2d 751. Therefore, we reject any statutory construction that would defeat this purpose. <em>See, e.g., State v. Saavedra, supra, </em>276 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 294, 647 A.2d 1348 (refusing to order return of seized weapons in context of unresolved domestic violence complaint despite claimed prosecutorial violation of 45-day deadline for filing of forfeiture petition).</p>\n<p id=\"b439-8\">It is obvious that the Legislature went to great lengths in <em>N.J.S.A </em>20:25-18 to identify domestic violence as \u201ca serious crime against society\u201d that demands for its victims \u201cmaximum protection from abuse.\u201d To offer such protection, the Legislature has codified in the Act certain remedies, of which the prosecutorial power <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>to petition for forfeiture of seized weapons is one and for which the Legislature has directed \u201cbroad application\u201d throughout the judicial system. <em>N.J.S.A </em>20:25-18. The investment of the power to petition in the prosecutor \u201c[was] not a legislative accident.\u201d <em>State v. Saavedra, supra, </em>276 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 294, 647 A.2d 1348.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b440-5\">As the chief law enforcement official in the county, ... the prosecutor is in the best position to assure even-handed approaches to the disposition of seized weapons and to present consistent positions to the court in summary hearings held in connection with forfeitures. It would not be surprising to find, for example, that in the zealous enforcement of this Act, there will be weapons seized out of a heightened sense of caution, erring on the side of safety rather than running the risk of being sorry. Again, the prosecutor, through a trained staff, would be able to recognize and discern these situations and deal with them in a responsible way, never losing sight of the primary objective of the act \u2014 protection of the victim.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b440-6\"><em>[Id. </em>at 294-295, 647 A.2d 1348 (citing <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:25-21d(3) and <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:25-20)].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b440-7\">The motion judge erred here because he improvidently placed the discretion over the exercise of prosecutorial authority in the hands of an alleged victim of domestic violence in contravention of the spirit of \u201cmaximum protection\u201d controlling the letter of the Act. <em>See Sun Co., Inc. v. Zoning Bd. of Adj. of Boro. of Avalon, supra, </em>286 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 445, 669 A.2d 833; <em>cf. State v. Solomon, </em>262 <em>N.J.Super. </em>618, 623, 621 A.2d 559 (Ch.Div.1993) (rejecting defense contention that Legislature had intended the term \u201ccomplaint\u201d in first enunciated circumstance of fourth paragraph of <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:25-21d(3) to refer to \u201ccriminal complaint\u201d on ground that victim would then have been exercising prosecutorial authority to dismiss criminal charges). To mandate the return of weapons either because the domestic violence complaint has been withdrawn or because, for example, the parties have specifically requested their return, would inhibit the Act\u2019s \u201cmaximum protection\u201d by precluding a prosecutor from questioning a defendant\u2019s fitness to possess them in light of the qualifying circumstances provided for in the first paragraph of <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:25-21d(3). <em>See In re Rehabilitation of Mut. Ben. Life Ins. Co., supra, </em>258 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 375, 609 A.2d 768 (citing <em>Juzek v. Hackensack Water Co., </em>48 <em>N.J. </em>302, 314-315, 225 A.2d 335 (1966)) (\u201c[A] grant of power is always accompanied by implied authority that is fairly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>and reasonably necessary for the effective exercise of that power.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b441-6\">As was the case in <em>Saavedra, </em>strict adherence here to the mandatory tenor of the fourth paragraph has \u201cyield[ed] results that are wholly inconsistent with the statutory scheme____\u201d <em>Kemp by Wright v. State, </em>286 <em>N.J.Super. </em>549, 557, 670 A.2d 31 (App.Div.1996). Such inconsistency was demonstrated in <em>State v. Warrick, supra, </em>283 <em>N.J.Super. </em>169, 661 A.2d 335, to the extent that the court there held that the mandatory language of the fourth paragraph of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:25-21d(3) delimits the prosecutorial authority granted by the section\u2019s first paragraph. The <em>Warrick </em>approach unduly circumscribes the authority conferred in furtherance of the Act\u2019s expressed purpose because it precludes the Family Part from making a clear determination before weapons are ordered returned that their recipient does not pose a threat to another person or to the general public. This determination may only be made following a hearing on the merits of a forfeiture motion. Therefore, we overrule <em>Warrick </em>insofar as its interpretation of the component parts of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:25-21d(3) requires dismissal of a forfeiture application based upon the prior withdrawal of a domestic violence complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-9\">We are mindful of the fact that the Act has also been misused with alarming frequency these days as a means of obtaining undue advantage in matrimonial litigation and of resolving disputes that mature adults should be able to reasonably address without violence. Even so, none of the findings necessary for the return of seized weapons under the Act may be articulated except by a truth-seeking hearing.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The Legislature has recognized this reality by enacting a process designed to promptly and fairly adjudicate petitions for forfeiture.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>The first paragraph of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:25-21d(3) requires the prosecutor, upon notice to the owner, to petition the court for forfeiture within 45 days of his receipt of the seized weapons. <em>State v. Saavedra, supra, </em>276 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 294, 647 A.2d 1348. The prosecutor is authorized to object to the return of weapons \u201con grounds that the owner is unfit or that the owner poses a threat to the public in general or a person or persons in particular.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:25-21d(3). The second paragraph of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:25-21d(3) mandates that a summary hearing must be held within 15 days of the notification in order to dispose of the State\u2019s petition. This relatively straightforward process enables our courts to weigh the merits of the exercise of the prosecutorial petition power and of the recovery of seized weapons.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-5\">In the present matter, the form order dismissing Mrs. Volpini\u2019s domestic violence complaint recited that the court \u201cha[d] received an affidavit in support of ... withdrawal and heard testimony of the plaintiff,\u201d from which it found that Mrs. Volpini (1) had not been coerced to withdraw the complaint; (2) \u201cunderstands the cycle of domestic violence\u201d as well as \u201cits probable reoccurrence\u201d; (3) knows of available protective resources; (4) appreciates that \u201cwithdrawal of the complaint and dismissal of the TRO will <em>eliminate </em>the protections that had been issued\u201d; (5) recognizes that withdrawal is not prejudicial to future applications if needed; and, (6) made an informed request for withdrawal. Obviously, the withdrawal of Mrs. Volpini\u2019s complaint did not mean that the domestic violence situation had been resolved, although hopefully it was.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-6\">To ensure \u201cmaximum protection\u201d for a potential victim of domestic violence through the \u201cbroad application\u201d of the prosecutorial power, we conclude that the motion judge should have considered the merits of the State\u2019s forfeiture petition before ordering the return of any seized weapons or permits to Mr. Volpini. <em>In re Return of Weapons of J.W.D., </em>290 <em>N.J.Super. </em>451, 676 A.2d 138, 141 (App.Div.1996) The approach outlined herein will advance the Act\u2019s protective purpose by preserving the full scope of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>remedial power to petition for forfeiture under the first paragraph, while applying the plain language of the fourth paragraph directing our courts to order the return of seized weapons and permits <em>\u201c[a]fter the hearing\u201d </em>if one of three alternative circumstances specified therein exists. Consequently, we hold that the Act affords the Family Part jurisdiction to consider at the summary hearing contemplated by <em>N.J.S. </em>A 2C:25-21d(3) the merits of the State\u2019s contention that the defendant posed a threat to public health and safety. The motion judge thus erred in refusing to hear the State\u2019s motion for forfeiture of the defendant\u2019s weapons, and a remand is required for that purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-6\">\n<em>III.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b443-7\">Even though the aforementioned process did not proceed in strict compliance with the schedule fixed by the Legislature, the defendant was still not entitled to the automatic return of his weapons in light of the importance of obtaining a final determination as to his qualifications to reclaim those weapons.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-8\">The motion judge denied the State\u2019s forfeiture motion after he had refused to grant a second adjournment to the State necessitated by its inability to produce Mrs. Volpini to testify despite having subpoenaed her.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b443-9\">The granting of an adjournment is discretionary with the trial court; an appellate tribunal may reverse a denial thereof only if the judicial action was \u201cclearly unreasonable in light of the accompanying and surrounding dreumstanees\u201d and \u201cresulted prejudicially to the rights of the party complaining.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b443-10\"><em>[Stott v. Greengos, </em>95 <em>N.J.Super. </em>96, 100, 230 A.2d 154 (App.Div.1967) (citations omitted) ].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b443-11\">In <em>Pepe v. Urban, </em>11 <em>N.J.Super. </em>385, 388-389, 78 A.2d 406 (App.Div.1951), for example, we reversed the denial of an adjournment to a plaintiff, who had sought to obtain the attendance of a witness, because the court\u2019s action deprived the plaintiff of an opportunity to present her case.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-12\">Under the circumstances here, the denial of the State\u2019s motion for an adjournment was an improper basis upon which to deprive the State of an opportunity to present its forfeiture <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>petition at a hearing. \u2018We must never forget that courts exist for the sole purpose of rendering justice according to law.\" <em>Id. </em>at 389, 78 A.2d 406. By refusing to adjourn the hearing in order to allow the State to compel Mrs. Volpini\u2019s presence, however, the motion judge prejudiced the State\u2019s right to adduce evidence that would have enabled the court to determine Mr. Volpini\u2019s qualifications to reclaim the weapons seized from him. Therefore, the motion judge inappropriately ordered the return of the defendant\u2019s weapons without first evaluating the merits of the State\u2019s petition through the presentation of Mrs. Volpini\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-5\">As noted, the motion judge also relied upon the violation of the 15-day hearing requirement of the second paragraph of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:25-21d(3). According to its forfeiture motion, the hearing on the State\u2019s petition was scheduled for May 25, 1995, which was well in excess of that deadline regardless of the three adjournments that were granted in this matter. The prosecutor indicated, however, that the State had moved as expeditiously as possible given the constraints of crowded court dockets and limited court schedules that our present system imposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-6\">\u201cThe law assists those who are vigilant, not those who sleep upon their rights.\u201d <em>Fox v. Township of Haddon, </em>137 <em>N.J. Eq. </em>394, 399, 45 A.2d 193 (Ch. 1945). There is no evidence here that the State slept on its rights or that \u201cthe delay has resulted in prejudice to [an] innocent party.\u201d <em>State by Comm. of Trans. v. Weiswasser, </em>287 <em>N.J.Super. </em>287, 300, 671 A.2d 121 (App.Div.1996) (citing <em>Lavin v. Hackensack Bd. of Educ., </em>90 <em>N.J. </em>145, 152, 153, 447 A.2d 516 (1982)). The Legislature is certainly cognizant of the fact that the calendars of our courts are busy ones. Accordingly, the State will not be penalized for its inability to obtain an earlier hearing date on its petition for forfeiture.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-7\">The order denying the motion for forfeiture is reversed. The matter is remanded to the Family Part for a plenary hearing in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b432-8\"> On April 29, 1995, this charge was administratively downgraded to a charge of harassment and returned to municipal court, where it was ultimately dismissed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b433-12\"> This refers to the seizure of weapons by a \"a law enforcement officer who has probable cause to believe that an act of domestic violence has been committed____\u201d <em>NJ.S.A. </em>2C:25-21d(l).
