Director, Division of Taxation, </em>14 <em>N.J. Tax </em>545, 560 (1995). We affirm substantially for the reasons expressed in the published opinion of Judge Lawrence L. Lasser, but add the following.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-9\">Before us, the Director expressly acknowledges that the merger of Lindenmeyr Paper Corporation into plaintiff and plaintiffs election of subchapter S status is not itself controlling. He further concedes the fact that although separate divisions of a single corporation, controlled by a single board of directors and senior officers, is involved, as opposed to parent and subsidiary corporations, such fact is not dispositive. The Director, therefore, does not contest Judge Lasser\u2019s statement that \u201c[b]ecause a corporate structure consists of divisions rather than subsidiaries does not in itself make the corporation unitary.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 558. <em>See also Mobil Oil Corp. v. Commissioner of Taxes, </em>445 <em>U.S. </em>425, 440, 100 <em>S.Ct. </em>1223, 1233, 63 L.Ed.2d 510, 523 (1980) (Vermont could apportionately tax dividends received from foreign subsidiaries and affiliates by corporation doing business in that State; \u201cthe <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>form of business organization may have nothing to do with the underlying unity or diversity of business enterprise\u201d); <em>Exxon Corp. v.

Tax </em>120 (App.Div.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b307-6\">As the United States Supreme Court has most recently said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b307-7\">Among the limitations the Constitution sets on the power of a single State to tax the multi-state income of a nondomiciliary corporation are these: there must be \u201ca \u2018minimal connection\u2019 between the interstate activities and the taxing State,\u201d <em>Mobil Oil Corp. V. Commissioner of Taxes of Vt., </em>445 <em>U.S. </em>425, 436-437, 100 <em>S.Ct. </em>1223, 1231, 63 L.Ed.2d 510 (1980) (quoting <em>Moorman Mfg. Co. v. Bair, </em>437 <em>U.S. </em>267, 273, 98 <em>S.Ct. </em>2340, 2344-45, 57 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>197 (1978)), and there must be a rational relation between the income attributed to the taxing State and the intrastate value of the corporate business. 445 <em>U.S. </em>at 437, 100 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1231-32, 63 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>510. Under our precedents, a State need not attempt to isolate the intrastate income-producing activities from the rest of the business; it may tax an apportioned sum of the corporation\u2019s multistate business if the business is unitary. E.g. <em>ASARCO Inc. v. Idaho State Tax Comm\u2019n, </em>458 <em>U.S. </em>307, 317, 102 <em>S.Ct. </em>3103, 3109-10, 73 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>787 (1982). A State may not tax a nondomiciliary corporation\u2019s income, however, if it is \u201cderive[d] from \u2018unrelated business activity\u2019 which constitutes a \u2018discrete business enterprise.\u2019 \u201d <em>Exxon Corp. v. Wisconsin Dept. of Revenue, </em>447 <em>U.S. </em>207, 224, 100 <em>S.Ct. </em>2109, 2120, 65 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>66 (1980) (quoting <em>Mobil Oil, supra, </em>at 442, 439, 100 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1234, 1232-33, 63 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>510).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b307-8\"><em>[Allied-Signal, Inc. v.

The Director asserts that the taxpayer has the burden of proving that its separate divisions did not constitute a unitary business operation, subject to apportionment or proportional taxation by the State. We agree. <em>See Container Corp. of America v. Franchise Tax Bd., </em>463 <em>U.S. </em>159, 164-65, 103 <em>S.Ct. </em>2933, 2939-40, 77 L.Ed.2d 545, 552 (1983) (taxpayer has the \u201cdistinct burden of showing by \u2018clear and cogent evidence\u2019 that [the state tax] results in extra-territorial values being taxed____\u201d). <em>See also Exxon Corp. v.

And there is sufficient evidence in the record to support his findings of facts and conclusions based thereon, <em>Rova Farms Resort, Inc. v. Investors Insurance Co., </em>65 <em>N.J. </em>474, 483-84, 323 A.2d 495 (1974). Plaintiffs chief executive officer and president testified that in 1987 the decision was made \u201cto farm out the management of our investments,\u201d that commencing in 1988 and for the tax years in question \u201call management of the investment portfolio [was] transacted by outside investment managers,\u201d and that the investment division did not \u201cregularly supply any services or money to the commercial division.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b309-6\">At argument before us, the Director noted that plaintiffs investment division transferred approximately $16,000,000 to the forest products division to acquire Lindenmeyr; that approximately $17,-000,000 was returned in 1988 after the corporation\u2019s directors decided in 1987 that it would limit the capital investment in the forest products division to $40,000,000; that consolidated financial statements used in connection with a 1987 operational $18,000,000 loan by the Prudential Insurance Company included financial information relative to both divisions, and that plaintiff obtained a letter of credit for the forest products\u2019 acquisition of a paper distributor, D.F. Monroe, in 1988 at a lower rate because the bank was custodian of securities owned by the investment division. The Director thus emphasized that the investment division\u2019s assets were being used in securing loans and credit for the forestry products operation.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-7\">It is certainly true that such conduct is relevant to the critical issue before us, <em>see Container Corp. v. Franchise Bd., supra, </em>463 <em>U.S. </em>at 166, 103 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2940, 77 L.Ed.2d at 553-54; <em>see also ASARCO Inc. v.

Moreover, while our Supreme Court, interpreting federal constitutional law, has said that \u201cit is a rare case\u201d that a single corporate entity will not be \u201cunitary,\u201d <em>Silent Hoist, </em>100 <em>N.J. </em>at 18, 494 A.2d 775, in that case \u201cthere was a distinct sharing of the value of common management, accounting and operations that [took] the portfolio income of [the] taxpayer well within the concept of a unitary business.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 23, 494 A.2d 775. However, here, the corporation\u2019s investments were truly \u201cdistinct\u201d from the \u201cmain line\u201d of the plaintiffs forestry products business. <em>See Container Corp. v.
