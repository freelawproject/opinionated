Arthur J. Stone was driving. Both men were in the employ of Case &amp; Martin. The wagon was a common pie wagon drawn by two horses. It was open in the back, storm door in the front end, sides inclosed, and arched roof over, and there was an alley through the center, and inside on the sides were built cells to accommodate pie plates. The wagon weighed from 2,500 tb 2,700 pounds. The horses\u2019 heads were about twenty-two or twenty-three feet from the back of the wagon.</p><p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b690-8\" pgmap=\"690\">Wabash avenue runs north and south, and 47th street runs east and west. Upon 47th street are two car tracks, one track upon which cars run west, and one track upon \"which cars run east. The cars run east upon the south \u25a0track. The cars at that point usually ran at a swift rate of speed, because there, along the line of 47th street, there were not many houses. When the horses had just stepped their front feet on the south crosswalk, the driver, Stone, put his head out of the door to see whether any cars were approaching. At that point the heads of the horses were at about the north line of the walk, and the track was twelve-to fifteen feet in front of them. Stone saw the approaching car, noticed that it was going at a pretty swift rate of speed, and locates it at an alley about 175 feet away from the center of Wabash avenue. He did not change the gait he was going at the time he saw the car, and did not look again until after the wagon was struck. The car appeared to him to be going very fast.</p><p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b691-3\" pgmap=\"691\">Stone says that the horses were going- at the rate of about four miles an hour. Menely says that they were going at about six miles an hour.</p><p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b691-4\" pgmap=\"691\">The cars that ran upon these lines were propelled by-electricity under the trolley system. At this time there was approabhing on the south track an electric car; it had stopped to take on passengers at State street, one block west of Wabash avenue, and started up again. Two persons besides the driver were standing upon the front platform. At the time the car started up the motorman began sounding his gong and continued to do so till near the point of the accident. The car was seen by the driver while the heads of his horses were twelve feet from the track in question; he knew the car was approaching at a rapid rate of speed, and that it would be necessary for him to travel at least forty feet before the end of his wagon cleared the track upon which the car was coming; he looked out only once to note the conditions, and thereafter paid no attention whatever to his surroundings until after the accident; and all the conditions and surroundings were as evident to him as to the motorman in charge of the car. Menely was thrown out, and was injured in consequence of the accident.</p><attorneys data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b691-5\" pgmap=\"691\">William J.

These questions were all fairly -submitted to the jury. We can not say that the verdict was so manifestly against the weight of the evidence as to the negligence of the appellant that the court should set it aside.</p> <p id=\"b691-9\" pgmap=\"691(10) 692(112)\">It is urged by appellant that there were several errors during the trial. The first which we shall notice is as to a question propounded by the court. When the appellee was on the witness stand, and the question of his damages was being considered, the court 9.sked him this: \u201c What were you capable of earning ? \u201d To this question counsel for appellant interposed a general objection. The facts were before the jury as to appellee\u2019s employment and duties. His reply to the question of the court was $65 per month. While this question is not proper, yet we are of the opinion that under the circumstances of this case the propounding of this question is not a reversible error.</p> <p id=\"b692-6\" pgmap=\"692\">It is also urged that the court erred in admitting testimony, against objection by appellant, as to the amount paid to the doctor. Appellee, when on the witness stand, was asked how much, he paid the doctor. He testified that the doctor\u2019s bill was $275, and that he paid it in a note. It is not contended but that this testimony would have been entirely proper if it had also been shown that the amount, as put in appellant\u2019s argument, was \u201c reasonable, customary or usual.\u201d As a part of the facts necessary to be presented to justify the jury in considering the amount of its verdict, this testimony was proper. If it was not supported by testimony showing that the doctor\u2019s bill was reasonable or for the customary or usual amount, the appellant should have moved to strike it out or have covered it by instruction to the jury. Neither was done. There was, therefore, no error at this point. It must not, however, be understood that we hold that a bill presented by a physician must be allowed without being supported by proper testimony, showing it to be reasonable.</p> <p id=\"b692-7\" pgmap=\"692\">Another point urged in behalf of appellant is that an objection was sustained by the court to this question, which was propounded to one of appellee\u2019s witnesses, viz.:</p> <blockquote id=\"b692-8\" pgmap=\"692\">\u201c Q. Isn\u2019t it true that you were running a gambling house over your saloon ? \u201d</blockquote> <p id=\"b692-9\" pgmap=\"692\">A reference to the bill of exceptions shows that the witness answered the question notwithstanding the ruling of the court. That answer stands as a part of the record now before this court. No error is here apparent.</p> <p id=\"b693-3\" pgmap=\"693\">It is submitted by counsel for appellant, in concluding their brief, that the evidence shows that \u201c Stone was at least as much to blame as appellant\u2019s motorman, and that therefore the judgment ought to be reversed without a remanding order.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b693-4\" pgmap=\"693\">Counsel for appellee, in their argument filed in this court, say: \u201cWe concede here, as we did at the trial, that the negligence of Stone, if any, must be attributed to appellee.\u201d We therefore give no consideration to that question.</p> <p id=\"b693-6\" pgmap=\"693\">Every one of the twenty instructions asked by appellant was given without modification, except the first one, which was a peremptory order to the jury to find the defendant not guilty, and which was refused. By these instructions given to the jury, the question of negligence by Stone, if any, was fully presented to the jury.</p> <p id=\"b693-7\" pgmap=\"693\">As to what Stone did or did not do, there is no conflict in the testimony pointed out to us, and we have noticed none. As to whether, upon a conceded or undisputed state of facts, the question of whether such facts constitute contributory negligence is one of law for the court, or of fact for the jury, there may be some doubt. That must depend very largely upon the facts and circumstances of each particular case. Wabash By. Co. v. Brown, 152 Ill. 484, 488; C. &amp; E. I. R. R. Co. v. Driscoll, 176 Ill. 330, 335; C. &amp; A. R. R. Co. v. Swan, 176 Ill. 424, 429.</p> <p id=\"b693-8\" pgmap=\"693\">A majority of this court are of opinion that this question,, as well as all other questions now before us, was fully and fairly submitted to the jury, and that its finding should not be disturbed.</p> <p id=\"b693-9\" pgmap=\"693\">The judgment of the Circuit Court is affirmed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
