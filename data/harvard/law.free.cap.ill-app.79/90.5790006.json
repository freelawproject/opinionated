And the law for this purpose affords every facility and safeguard ; tolerates the most searching inquiry at the expense of much delay and inconvenience, and assists with'its authority to elicit the facts, and the disposition of mind of those proposed as jurors, so that a judgment can be formed as to their fitness for the responsible duty required of them.

Pereira, on behalf of Louis Pereira, deceased, against the American Bridge Works, a corporation, to recover damages on account of the death of Louis B. Pereira. The plaintiff charges that this accident took place on the 31st day of July, 1896, or about that time, from the alleged negligence of the Bridge Works and its employes. It is further claimed that this deceased, Louis B. Pereira, was at that time in the employ of the Bridge Works, and was carrying out the orders given to him. The defendants were engaged in the manufacture of bridges, and had a plant or factory for that purpose. It is alleged that one of the girders fell upon him and caused his death, and it is further claimed that this girder fell upon him by reason of the alleged negligence of the company.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b102-11\" pgmap=\"102\">\u201cHas any one of you ever heard of this case before?

The court asks these questions only in order to save time.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b104-14\" pgmap=\"104\">\u201cMr. Hay: Will the court allow me to go on with my examination on this line ?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b104-15\" pgmap=\"104\">\u201c The Court: Oh, no.

Indeed, the fact that the court, in the examination of the jurors, asked a question, is evidence that in the opinion of the - court, the question was proper. A party to a civil action is not limited in the examination of the jurors to questions for the purpose of ascertaining whether the person interrogated possesses the necessary qualifications to act as a juror. Each party is entitled to three peremptory challenges and is, therefore, entitled to question each juror, within reasonable limits, for the purpose of determining whether or not he will peremptorily challenge him.</p> <p id=\"A_5\" pgmap=\"106\">In City of Vandalia v. Seibert, 47 Ill. App. 477, the judgment was reversed because the court refused to permit the defendant\u2019s attorney.to ask each juror whether the plaintiff\u2019s attorneys were in his, the juror\u2019s, employ, as attorneys. The court says: \u201c The right to a trial by an impartial jury is fundamental. The law permits an examination to. ascertain whether or not the jurors are impartial, as between the litigants. If certain facts are ascertained by such examination, they constitute cause of challenge. The field of inquiry is not limited, however, to the ascertainment of these facts alone. Beyond that field the range of inquiry is largely within the discretion of the examining counsel, supervised by- the court. He is free to challenge, within the number limited by the law, without giving any reason therefor. Therefore, within the general limits of propriety and pertinency, the examining counsel may search for facts that would reasonably justify a peremptory challenge.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b106-6\" pgmap=\"106(88) 107(229)\">In Donovan v. The People, 139 Ill. 412, the judge of the trial court \u201c examined four of the jurors in respect to their statutory qualifications, and also as to whether they had heard or read the facts of the case, knew the defendant or her attorney, or had formed or expressed any opinion as to her guilt or innocence, or entertained any prejudice,- or knew of any reason why they should not give the defendant a fair and impartial trial according to the law and the evidence.\u201d After this examination by the court, the defendant\u2019s attorney claimed the right to examine the jurors for cause, and to put questions to them to determine whether he would interpose peremptory challenges, but the court denied the right, saying: \u201cExcept you examine the jurors for cause through the mouth of the court, you can not examine them at all.\u201d This was held reversible error, the court saving: \u201cWe are of opinion that the court erred in refusing the defendant\u2019s counsel permission to ask pertinent and proper questions of the persons called as jurors, testing their capacity and competency, and to advise him of the propriety of exercising the right of peremptory challenge. Upon the application of counsel for permission to examine the jurors called, the court announced as its ruling,\" \u2018 except you examine the jurors for cause through the mouth of the court, you can not examine them at all,\u2019 thereby precluding, through the court or otherwise, any examination from which could be determined whether the right of peremptory challenge should be exercised. Peremptory challenges of jurors are allowed by law to be made or omitted, according to the judgment, will or caprice of the party entitled thereto, and no reason is ever given, or can be required, for the manner in which the right is exercised. 4 Blackstone\u2019s Com., 353; 1 Oh. Cr. Law, 534.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b107-7\" pgmap=\"107\">The fact that some of the same or substantially similar questions may have been previously put by the court does not justify the ruling, for two reasons: First, the record shows that none of the questions were answered \u2022 by the jurors. The words \u201cno response\u201d necessarily mean no answer by word or sign. Second, while the court may examine jurors for the purpose of determining whether they possess the statutory qualifications, such examination can not operate to exclude the right of a party to examine the jurors individually. This is a valuable and substantial right. Proffatt on Jury Trial, Sec. 145. It has been the uniform practice in this State since its organization to permit such examination, and is recognized by section 21 of the statute in regard to jurors. Donovan v. The People, supra.</p> <p id=\"b108-4\" pgmap=\"108\">Counsel for appellee refer to the judge\u2019s certificate to the bill of exceptions,: and, apparently rely on it as curative of errors which may have occurred in the impaneling of the jury. The judge certifies that \u201cAfter the court had completed questioning the jury, he was satisfied that the members of the jury would try the said cause fairly and impartially, according to the evidence, and would observe and follow the instructions of the court, and that none of the jury ivas acquainted with either of the parties, and that none of the jury was ever involved in the same kind of an accident as is in question in this cause, either in his own behalf or for others, and that none of them had a suit like this pending in court, or ivas in any way interested in such suit, and that none of them had any feeling of prejudice, bias or sympathy either for or against such a suit or claim as this, or against any person bringing such a suit, and that none of them had any feeling of prejudice or bias for or against a corporation, and that every one of them could try the cause, as far as the defendant was concerned, just the same as if the defendant, instead of being a corporation, were a natural living person.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b108-5\" pgmap=\"108\">How, in respect to the error assigned, viz., depriving appellant of the right to examine the jurors, it is obvious that the fact that the court \u201c was satisfied,\u201d as stated in the certificate, is wholly immaterial. Such certificates as the foregoing are certainly not authorized by the statute, which merely provides: \u201c If, during the progress of any trial in any civil cause, either party shall allege an exception to the opinion of the court, and reduce the same to writing, it shall be the duty of the judge to allow said exception and sign and' seal the same, and the said exception shall thereupon become a part of the record of said cause.\u201d The office of the judge\u2019s signature and seal is to attest and verify the correctness of the bill of exceptions. If incorrect, he should refuse to sign it till corrected, but ive are inclined to the opinion that he can not add to, abstract from, or in any way modify a bill of exceptions presented for his signature by a mere certificate.</p> <p id=\"b109-4\" pgmap=\"109\">Having carefully read and considered the evidence, our conclusion is that, to say the least, it is a very doubtful question whether the verdict is sustained by the greater weight of the evidence-\u2014so doubtful that, had the verdict been for the defendant, we would not feel justified in disturbing it as being contrary to the weight of the evidence. Such being the case, appellant was especially entitled to a fair and impartial trial and to all its rights in the premises.</p> <p id=\"b109-5\" pgmap=\"109\">We find no substantial error in the giving or refusal of any instruction or in the admission or rejection of evidence.</p> <p id=\"b109-6\" pgmap=\"109\">The judgment will be reversed and the cause remanded.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
