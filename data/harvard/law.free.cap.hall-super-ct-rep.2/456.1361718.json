The declaration, in its first count, set forth, that certain differences having arisen between the plaintiff and the defendant, the parties, by a certain <em>bond </em>of arbitration, bearing date the 9th day of February, 1839, became bound to each other, in a certain penal sum, to abide by the award of certain arbitrators, therein named, who were to decide all matters in controversy between them, and make their award in writing, and under seal, on .or before the \u00bf5th day of the same month; which time for making the award, (the declaration alleged,) was afterwards, and before the time for making the same expired, to wit, on the 35th day of February, 1839, by consent of the plaintiff and defendant, \u201c <em>enlarged </em>until the 6th day of March, then next,\u201d it being agreed, by the parties, that the award made within the extended time, should be binding and conclusive upon them. This count then averred, that the arbitrators duly made their award within the time, for that purpose last appointed, determining thereby that the defendant was indebted to the plaintiff in the sum of 1,334 dollars, to be paid by him on or before the 31st of March, 1839, of which the defendant had notice <em>; yet the </em>said Stephen Myers did not, nor would, at the time, for that purpose in the award appointed, or at any other time, pay <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>to the plaintiff the said sum of 1,324 dollars, or any part thereof, although requested, whereby an action accrued to the plaintiff to recover the amount of said award\u00bb</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b465-3\">In answer to this count of the declaration, the defendant pleaded that the <em>bond </em>therein set forth, contained a condition, stipulating that the award contemplated should be made by the 25th day of February, 1829; whereas, in point of fact, it was not made until the 6th of March following, as fully appeared by the same, under the hands and seals of the arbitrators. The bond itself and its condition, together with the award, were spread out <em>in extenso </em>upon the plea, which concluded with the usual verification.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b465-4\">The plaintiff demurred generally to the plea, and <em>Mr. George Griffin, </em>in support of the demurrer, insisted that the plea was bad, because it takes no notice of the <em>enlargement of the time </em>for making the award, set forth in the declaration, which was an essential ingredient in the cause of action declared upon. That the enlarged time incorporated itself into the bond,\u2014and a plea which takes no notice of this particular, must necessarily be defective upon general demurrer. <em>[Evans v.

Holden, </em>contra, for the defendant,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ARc\">insisted that the <em>declaration </em>was bad. That the action should not have been brought either upon the bond or the award, but on the submission implied in the new agreement for enlarging the time. The declaration states, that the time for making the award was extended, but it does not tell us how it was enlarged\u2014whether by parol, or by writing. When the time was extended, a new agreement was <em>formed; </em>the old one was abandoned or merged in the new one, and an action of debt, founded upon the original bond, could not be sustained. [3 <em>D. and E. </em>592, <em>(n.) </em>9 <em>J. R. </em>115, 2 <em>Wend. R. </em>399.]</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b466-8\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>Oakley, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AJ0_\">This case comes before us on a general demurrer to the defendant\u2019s plea to the first count of the declaration. That count sets forth, 1. That mutual bonds of submission to arbitration, dated the 9th of February, 182.9, were executed by the parties, by which the award was to be made, on or before the <em>25th day of February. </em>2. That before that period, the time for making the award was extended by the parties to the <em>6th of March, </em>and that it was agreed, that an award, to be made within such extended time, should be binding. 3. That an award was made within such enlarged time;\u2014and the count then sets forth a breach of the award, on the part of the defendant, in the non-payment of the money awarded. The plea sets forth the bond and its conditions, together with the award, by which it appears that the latter was made after the expiration of the time limited for making it, in the conditions of the bond. To this plea the plaintiff demurs.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-9\">The question sought to be raised by the defendant in this case, is, whether an action of debt can be sustained on an arbitration bond, when the award is not made within the time specified in the conditions of the bond, though the parties may have extended that time by a new agreement. It seems to be settled, in such a case, <em>[Freeman v. Adams, </em>9 <em>J. R. </em>115,] that the action must be on the submission implied in the new agreement. The defendant here, however, seems to have mistaken the nature of the action, as set forth in. the plaintiff\u2019s first count. It is not founded on the bond, but on the submission made by the new agreement, and on the award made in pursuance of it. The count sets forth all the circumstances,\u2014the bond, the enlargement of the time, the agreement that the award shall be binding, and the award itself. It is strictly appropriate to the case, and the plea is clearly no answer to it. There must be judgment for the plaintiff on the demurrer.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-10\">\n<em>Judgment for the plaintiff, with leave to the defendant, &amp;c.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b466-11\">[Geo. W.
