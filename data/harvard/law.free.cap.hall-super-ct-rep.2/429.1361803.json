At the end of 19 months from its date, demand of payment was made, which being refused, notice was given to the endorser, who claimed to be discharged by the laches of the holder.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b437-12\">Held, that the rule requiring promissory notes, payable on demand, to be presented within a <em>\u201c </em>reasonable time\u201d was applicable chiefly to those which are made for commercial purposes. That the present was to be likened to a case of guaranty or suretyship, and that the defendant was liable on his endorsement.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b437-13\">This was an action of assumpsit,brought by the endorsee against the defendant, as endorser of a promissory note of the following tenor.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b437-14\"><em>New-York, June </em>18, 1827.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b437-15\">On demand, we promise to pay to the order of Simeon Hyde, eight hundred dollars, for value received, with interest from date, without default or defalcation.

That the plaintiff was a farmer by occupation, an old man, between 70 and 80 years of age, residing at a place called \u201c The English Neighborhood,\u201d in the state of New-Jersey, about twelve miles from New-York. That the plaintiff <em>loaned </em>to Banta, (one of the makers,) the sum of 800 dollars, on the 8th of June, 1828, and received the aforesaid note, endorsed by the defendant, as security for the repayment of the loan.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b438-7\">The interest on the note was paid at the end of one year from its date, but it did not appear that any demand of payment was made of the makers, until the 23d of March, 1829, and notice was given to the endorser the next day. At the date of the note, Eleazer Hyde, one of the makers, was dead, and his house had become insolvent, having made an assignment of their property to John E. Hyde, the defendant, and one W. Cox, for the benefit of their creditors; and it was stipulated in a schedule of said assignment, that if the defendant was liable on his endorsement of said note, that, then, the amount should be refunded to him out of the proceeds of the assignment.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b438-8\">Upon this state of facts, the defendant contended that he was not liable, being discharged from his endorsement by the laches of the holder, in not making demand and giving due notice. The presiding Judge (Hoffman) remarked, that the points presented were chiefly questions of law, and by his recommendation, a verdict was taken for the plaintiff, subject to the opinion of the court upon a case, <em>either </em>party having liberty to turn the same into a bill of exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b438-9\">The cause was now argued by <em>Mr. S.

The defendant resided in New-York, and the plaintiff in the state of New-Jersey, about 12 miles from the city. The demand of payment, of the makers, was made on the 23d <em>of March, </em>1829, and notice given to the defendant, as endorser, on the next day. The question is, whether the defendant was discharged by the delay in demanding payment.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-4\">It is settled in our courts, that a note, payable on demand, must be presented for payment within a reasonable time, and notice given to the endorser, and that when the facts are ascertained, what is a reasonable time, is a question of law. [Sice v. <em>Cunningham, </em>1 <em>Cowen </em>408. <em>Furman v. Haskin, </em>2 <em>Caines\u2019 R. </em>369.] Every case must, in some measure, depend on its own circumstances. In the present case, it appears that the note was given for a loan of money, and upon interest, and that the interest was paid and endorsed on the note at the end of one year. Although there is no explicit evidence to show that the defendant knew the purpose for which the note was made, or how it was used by one of the makers, for whose accommodation it was endorsed; yet, the circumstances of the case are sufficient to justify the belief that the defendant was apprized of the plaintiff\u2019s possession of the note; and it evidently was not made for the ordinary purposes of mercantile negotiation. This is apparent from the phraseology of the note itself, and the caution with which it is worded. It is payable on demand, it is true, but it bears interest, and is to be paid by the makers without \u201c <em>default.\u201d </em>This is sufficient to show that the endorsement of the defendant, was obtained under no ordinary circumstances, and that the <em>makers </em>had assured him, that he should come to no harm by his act of endorsing. The note itself bears evidence upon its face, that it was given to secure the re-payment of a loan, and that it was not to be demanded at the usual time, and that the endorser was considered in the light of a surety or guarantee.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-5\">The rule, requiring a presentment within a <em>reasonable </em>time, was intended for, and is applicable to negotiable instruments <em>made for commercial purposes only. </em>It was not intended for cases of suretyship, or notes of a like description, and the present one is, evidently excluded from the rule, by the peculiar circumstances <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>attending it. Here the holder was an old man, not connected with business, residing at some distance from the city. The defendant knew these circumstances, and cannot claim any peculiar, indulgence from a consideration of the facts. As each case is governed in some degree, by the circumstances attending it, in this, there must be judgment for the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-2\">\n<em>Judgment for the plaintiff.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b440-3\">S.
