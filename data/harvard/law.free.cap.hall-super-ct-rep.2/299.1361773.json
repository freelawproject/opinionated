To this last plea, the plaintiff replied, that the defendant was the <em>stakeholder </em>of a bet, made upon ^he event of a trotting match between two horses ; and that the sum sued for, was deposited in <em>his </em>hands, as such stockholder, by the plaintiff. The defendant rejoined, that the trotting match was performed and decided, and that the plaintiff was a <em>loser </em>of the match. To this rejoinder, the plaintiff demurred generally.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b308-7\"><em>Mr. D. Graham </em>for the plaintiff, and in support of the demurrer, contended,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AJ4\">that the rejoinder was no bar to the action, and being defective in substance, it was subject to a general demurrer. <em>[He cited </em>10 <em>J. R. </em>478. 7. Cowen\u2019s <em>R. </em>496. 1. <em>R. L. </em>153. sec. <em>2. Ib. 222. sec. </em>5. <em>of the act to prevent horse-racing.</em>]</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b308-8\"><em>Mr. Anthon, contra, </em>for the defendant,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AsV\">insisted, that the limitation prescribed by the <em>act </em>giving the action, furnished a defence to the <em>stakeholder, </em>as well as the winner. [He <em>cited 12. J. R. 1. </em>13. <em>Ib. </em>88.]</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b308-10\">Oakley J.</author>\n<p id=\"AkMX\">When this case was formerly before us, <em>[ante. vol. 1. p. </em>300,] we held that an action of assumpsit, would not lie against the defendant; and that if any action could be sustained, it must be debt, under the statute. The questions now presented in this record, are, first, whether an action of debt, in the present form, will lie; and, secondly, whether such action must be brought against a stakeholder, within three months after the cause of action accrues.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-12\">The first question seems to be decided in <em>Allen v. Ehle, </em>[7 <em>Cow. R. </em>496.] That was an action of <em>debt, </em>in the form prescribed by the act, by the loser against the stakeholder of a bet, on the event of a horse-race. The objection was then taken, that the statute gave the action only against the <em>winner. </em>The court held, that the stakeholder was within its spirit and meaning, and the plaintiff was permitted to recover. That case, therefore, seems to be in point, upon the first question arising here.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>As to the second question, the fifth section of the act to prevent horse-racing, [1 <em>R. L. 222,] </em>provides, that any person, who may , ., , - ,, have paid any money on the event of any race, may recover the same <em>in like manner, </em>as is provided in the second and third sections of the gaming act. The second section of that act, gives an action of debt, for money had and received, against the <em>winner, </em>provided the same is brought within three months after the cause of action accrued. As the action against the <em>stakeholder, </em>is founded on this act, in connexion with the fifth section of the act to prevent horse-racing; it seems to me, that, the protection afforded to the winner, by the limitation in the act, is extended to him. No action can be sustained, under the second section of the gaming act, which is not commenced within three months after the loss of the money; and as all actions under the fifth section of the act against horse-racing, must be brought in <em>the manner </em>prescribed by the gaming act; it seems to follow, that the same limitation will apply to them.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-10\">I am of opinion, therefore, that upon the whole record, the defendant is entitled to judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-11\">\n<em>Judgment for the defendant, on the demurrer, with leave to the plaintiff, &amp;c.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b309-12\">[D.
