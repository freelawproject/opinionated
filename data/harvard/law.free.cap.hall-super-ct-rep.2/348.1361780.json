He read an affidavit, showing that the default had been entered after the defendant\u2019s pleas had been received by the plaintiff\u2019s attorney. It appeared that the pleas served were double, a special plea being added to the general issue; but they were not signed by <em>counsel. </em>The attorney for the plaintiff had, therefore, treated them as a nullity, and entered a default for want of a plea.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b356-7\"><em>Mr. D. B. Talmadge, </em>for the plaintiff,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A9vY\">offered <em>to </em>waive the default, if the defendant would file an affidavit of <em>merits; </em>but this was declined by the defendant, <em>Mr. Talmadge </em>then contended that the pleas should have been signed by counsel to be regular, and that the court would not set aside the default, except upon proper terms. [He cited <em>Dubois v. Philips, 5 J. R. </em>236, <em>Satterlee v. Satterlee, </em>8 <em>J. R. </em>327. <em>Steward v. Hotchkiss, </em>2 <em>Cowen\u2019s R. </em>634. <em>Brewster v.

The court, in the exercise of its discretion, may, however, set such defaults aside, and will generally do so upon proper cause shown. If these pleas are interposed for delay merely, they are not entitled to favor, and that they are so, the court are compelled to infer, from the fact, that the defendant\u2019s counsel refuses to accept the terms proffered by the plaintiff, and file an affidavit of merits. If he is not willing to give this test of the sincerity of his defence, the court will not interpose to correct an irregularity, for his benefit.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-9\">\n<em>Motion denied, with costs.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"ARv\">[E.
