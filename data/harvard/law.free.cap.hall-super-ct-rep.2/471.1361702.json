And where the declaration alleged, that the plaintiff, \u201c <em>levied his certain plaint\u201d </em>in the Marine Court, against the defendant, for a cause of action arising within its jurisdiction, and such proceedings were had, that a judgment was obtained, &amp;c., a demurrer to it, for want of jurisdiction, as manifested by the pleading, was held to be not well taken.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b479-13\">Although the first process in the Marine Court is by summons or warrant, it does not follow, from this, that such process may not be founded upon a plaint previously filed. But if otherwise, then the words, \u201clevied his certain plaint,\u201d are to be taken as tantamount to \u201c commenced his suit,\u201d or \u201cimpleaded the defendant ;\u201d either of which would be sufficient, prime <em>fade, </em>to show, that the court had jurisdiction over the defendant\u2019s person.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b479-14\">This was an action of debt, upon a judgment obtained by the plaintiff against the defendant in the Marine Court. The declaration alleged, that the plaintiff, on the 20th day of May, in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>year 1829, in the Marine Court, in the city of New-York, \u201c levie<em>d </em>his certain plaint\u201d against the defendant, \u201c in a plea of trespass on the case, for a cause of action, arising within the jurisdiction of said court,-and such proceedings were had,\u201d that afterwards the plaintiff, by the judgment and consideration of said court, recovered against the defendant the sum of money demanded, \u201cwhereof the defendant is convicted, as by the record,\u201d thereof fully appears.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b480-6\">The defendant demurred to the declaration, and <em>Mr. E. Barnes, </em>in his behalf, contended,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ABF\">I. That the plaintiff, having as full and ample means-of obtaining a satisfaction of the judgment, in the Marine Court, by execution, at the time Of <em>the commencement of the suit, </em>as he had at the time <em>the judgment was obtained there, </em>could not, for the mere purpose of accumulating costs, bring a new action thereon. <em>[Hale v. Angel, </em>20 <em>J. R. </em>342. 2 <em>Bac. Abridg. p. </em>14. <em>A. Roll's Abridg. </em>600, 601.]</p>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b480-8\">II. That the declaration failed to show, that the Marine Court had jurisdiction, so as to enable it to give d valid judgment in the premises. [2 <em>R. L. </em>381. 8 <em>Cowen's R. </em>314. 6 Ib. 234. 3 <em>Dall. </em>382. 4 Ib. 8. 5 <em>Cranch, </em>173. 5 <em>Jac. Law. Dic. </em>158.]</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b480-9\"><em>Mr. D. Graham, contra, </em>contended,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Aj5\">that the declaration contained a legal cause of action which was well pleaded. [2 <em>R. L. 381, sec. 106. Ib. 370. sec. </em>88. 112. 1 <em>Saund. </em>92. <em>n. </em>2 <em>Chitty P. </em>181, notis.]</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b480-11\">Oakley, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AZm\">The defendant contends, that no action of debt will lie on a judgment obtained in the Marine Court. It is clearly otherwise. The case of <em>Hale v. Angel, </em>[20 <em>J. R. </em>342,] shows that such an action may be maintained, even on a judgment in a Justice\u2019s Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-12\">It is said, however, that the declaration in this case, does not show, that the Marine Court had jurisdiction, so as. to make its judgment effectual. The count states, that the plaintiff \u201c <em>levied his certain plaint </em>in said court, against the defendant, for a cause of action arising within the jurisdiction of said court, and such pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>ceedings were thereupon had, that judgment was obtained, &amp;c. This would clearly be sufficient, as to those counts where the action is, technically speaking, commenced <em>by </em>plaint. [1 Saund. 92. <em>n. </em>2.] But as to the Marine Court, it is said, that no such proceeding as that by plaint is known, but that the first process is, in all cases, to be by summons or warrant. Although the statute directs, that the first process shall be a summons or warrant, it does not necessarily exclude the idea, that such first process may be founded on a plaint. The Marine Court is a court of record, and its organization will admit, for aught I can see, like other courts of record, of the practice of filing a plaint, as the foundation of the first process against the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-8\">Were this otherwise, I should be inclined to hold, that the words, \u201c <em>levied his certain </em>plaint,\u201d are to be taken, not in their technical sense, but as equivalent to the allegation, that the plaintiff in that court had commenced his suit against the defendant, or <em>had impleaded the defendant, </em>either of which would be sufficient, <em>prima facie, </em>to show that the court, rendering the judgment, had jurisdiction of the defendant\u2019s person. The legal intendment in such a case would be, that the suit had been legally commenced. On the . whole, I think, there is no foundation for the objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-10\">\n<em>Judgment for the plaintiffs on the demurrer.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b481-11\">[D. Graham, Jun., <em>Att'y for the plff. </em>E. Barnes, <em>Att'y for the deft.]</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
