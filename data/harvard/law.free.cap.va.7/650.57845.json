The \u25a0cause was removed from <em>Lynchburg </em>to the circuit court of <em>Franklin, </em>afterwards to <em>Floyd, </em>and then to <em>Montgomery. </em>The circuit court of <em>Montgomery </em>declared the devise and bequest to the executors to be too vague and uncertain to be carried into effect, and in conformity with the prayer of the bill, decreed partition of the real estate amongst the heirs, and ordered an account of the executorship with a view to a distribution of the personalty.

But the executors make no such claim. They ask only the privilege of executing the trust. The will is sufficiently certain as to the decedent\u2019s <em>family, </em>if not as to other persons in distress ; and the uncertainty of a part cannot destroy the parts which are certain. The words <em>relations, family, kindred </em>&amp;c. might originally have been thought uncertain, and embracing all relations to the most distant cousin; but the courts have given certainty to these uncertain words. To preserve the great object of the will, they have confined their generality to the degrees of the statute. The cases shew that the courts anxiously search for a rule to preserve the will, rather than destroy it. They strive to confine the power within legal limits, rejecting what would make it void for generality.

They control the whole clause, and the whole is therefore void for uncertainty. <em>Gallego\u2019s ex\u2019ors </em>v. <em>Attorney General, 3 </em>Leigh 450. Can the court strike out the words \u201cor any other person or persons who may be in distress and whom they may think I would myself have assisted in such cases?\u201d To do so would be not to carry the will into effect, but to make a will. Francis\u2019s Maxims 162. It is clear that those words enlarge the sense before expressed. Suppose the executors were to give the whole surplus to a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>particular daughter, already largely provided for: would this be right ? Or suppose there were no members of the family in distress: could the executors at once give them the surplus ? If they could not, it is because the words <em>who may he in distress </em>are efficient and controlling. Supposing they could not, the argument for the appellants is unsound, for, to support that argument, it must be considered that the members of the family take a vested interest. This position cannot be sustained. No one can look at the whole clause together, and not see that the executors were intended to have a discretion. They are not bound to give something to every member of the family. The trust is personal, to be executed in the lifetime of the executors. Such distresses only were contemplated, as might happen in that time.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b674-11\">Johnson, in reply.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A82S\">Suppose the testator had said, his son <em>John </em>shall have power to give a particular tract of land to his son <em>Tom </em>or to his daughter <em>Betsey, </em>and <em>Tom dies; </em>cannot the land be given to <em>Betsey </em>? Or suppose, in <em>England, </em>a power is given to appoint among <em>relations, </em>and some are <em>aliens; </em>would that disable the donee from giving to those capable of taking ? Take it that both branches of the power are valid: then the executors may give the whole to members of the family. Can it be that they shall not have power to do this, when the latter branch is void for uncertainty ? The words <em>who may he in distress </em>need not be read as applying to members of the family; but if they be applicable, the court will find, by the latest cases, that the words <em>poor, distressed, </em>&amp;c, are decided to be surplusage, and the will is construed as if no such words were used.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b674-12\">Caer, <em>J.</em></author>\n<p id=\"AsqE\">This case turns wholly upon the construction of the last clause in the testator\u2019s will, which, after making provision for his wife and children, vests a considerable fund in his executors as trustees for the purposes expressed by the following words: \u201c They shall <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>(as it is my will and desire) so dispose of the same, for the purpose of aiding any of the members of my family, or any other person or persons who may be in distress, and whom they may think I would myself have assisted in such cases, confiding the disposition of the said trust fund entirely to their discretion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b675-4\">The plaintiffs filed their bill, insisting that this trust was void <em>in loto </em>for uncertainty, and praying that the fund might be distributed according to the statute. The court below, being of opinion that this clause was too vague and uncertain to be carried into effect, and therefore void, ordered a distribution according to the prayer of the bill: and from this decree the appeal is taken. As nothing is more consonant to justice and the respect we feel for the will of the dead, it has always been the anxious effort of courts to carry into effect last wills and testaments; and it is only when such wills violate the rules of law, or are utterly uncertain, that this is refused. As a proof of this anxiety, many cases might be cited. If a man creates a trust for the benefit of his <em>family, his relations, his </em>kindred\u2014all these descriptions (though, taken literally, they are perfectly indefinite) have received such a construction as restrains them within certain limits, and thus sustains and effectuates the will of the testator. And if one part of a devise be void for uncertainty, and another part good, even though both be contained in the same clause, they will, if separable in their nature, be divided, and the good part sustained. The cases cited by the president shew this as fully as authority can shew any thing. I will not repeat them: but I may refer to Sugden on Powers 518. and many pages following, where all the cases are collected, and the matter treated with the usual ability of that valuable writer. That part of the clause in the will before us, which empowers the trustees to give a part of the fund \u201c to any other person or persons who may be in distress,\u201d is clearly void for uncertainty; but why should <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>it vitiate the foregoing part, for the benefit of the members of testator\u2019s family? It is answered, because the word <em>or </em>couples the succeeding with the foregoing part of the sentence, and makes the word <em>distress </em>relate back t0 <em>\u201c </em>members of my family.\u201d Suppose this construction were agreed to : does any one suppose that a trust raised by a testator for the benefit of any members of his family who might be in distress, would be void ? The books teem with such cases; and the only question about them is, whether the words <em>in distress </em>are not wholly inoperative, and the distribution of the fund to be made without any <em>regard </em>to them. The cases are both ways. <em>Sugden </em>(p. 521.) after stating them, concludes thus: \u201cUpon the whole then, there appears to be great reason to contend that the true rule is, that the epithet <em>poor, necessitous, or </em>the like, is merely nugatory, although certainly there is a considerable weight of authority in favour of the contrary doctrine.\u201d But all the books agree that such a trust is valid; and surely, if so, the connecting it with a trust void for uncertainty cannot vitiate it.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-4\">It was no part of the purpose of the bill to take the trust fund from the trustees, for any other cause than that the trust was void and the fund distributable. That having failed, the bill must be dismissed, and the fund left in those hands to which the testator has confided it\u2014a trust with which the court would interfere only in case of a defect of trustees, or of their refusing to execute, or being in the course of violating the trust.</p>\n<author id=\"b676-5\">Tucker, P.</author>\n<p id=\"AcQ\"><em>Thomas Hill, </em>by his will made in 1827, after various provisions for his wife and children, devises a considerable estate, both real and personal, to his executors, in trust to sell the real estate at such times as they in their discretion shall judge most advantageous to those who might be interested in the distrib\u00fction; and gives the proceeds of sales, and the debts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>which should be collected, and his moneys on hand, in trust to his executors that they should so dispose of the same <em>for the purpose of aiding any of the members of his family, or any other person or persons who may be in distress, </em>and whom they might think he would himself have assisted in such cases, confiding the disposition of the said trust fund entirely to their discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-3\">It is agreed on all hands that the words <em>any other person or persons who may be in distress, </em>are too vague and uncertain, and that the declaration of trust as to such persons is altogether inoperative and void. <em>Gallego\u2019s ex\u2019ors </em>v. <em>Attorney General, </em>3 Leigh 450. But it is contended on the part of the appellees, and so has it been decided by the circuit court, that tho indefinite character of this provision rendered void and inoperative the whole of that clause in the will, and that the heirs and distributees were entitled to demand the property altogether discharged of the trust. On the other hand it is alleged, that the trust for the benefit of the testator\u2019s family is sufficiently definite and precise, and is not vitiated by its connexion, in the same clause, with the vague and indefinite declaration of trust in favour of persons in distress. I am clearly of this opinion. No authority in point has been produced to shew that a declaration of trust, in favour of certain definite objects of the testator\u2019s bounty, is avoided because in the same clause there is a limitation to persons incapable of taking ; or because there is a limitation to persons not certain and ascertained. Reason and authority, on the other hand, conspire to say, that so far as the testator\u2019s will is legal, intelligible and certain, it shall be effectuated, and what is illegal, insensible and uncertain shall be rejected. So also, where from any cause the will shall fail of effect in part, it will not affect the residue, if they be not inseparably connected. Hence if a legacy be given to two, one of whom dies in the testator\u2019s lifetime, so that as to him the will cannot operate, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>the whole will go to the survivor. 1 Roper 330. So far from avoiding the whole bequest, the death of the party in this case enlarges the survivor\u2019s interest. So, doubtless, if in <em>England </em>lands were devised to be equally divided between A. B. and C. the last of whom, being a papist, would be incapable of taking, the whole would go to A. and B. and the devise to 0. would be rejected. For the rule as laid down by the judges is, that \u201c the method of the courts is not to set aside the, intent because it cannot take effect so fully as the testator desired, <em>hut to let it work as far as it can.\" </em>Ca. Temp, Talb. 50. And this is with good reason ; for why shall a testator\u2019s disposition of his estate, in so far as it is intelligible, legal and certain, be defeated, merely because, in his ignorance, he has combined with it what is either insensible, or contrary to law, or too vague to be effectuated ? I can perceive neither good sense nor justice in such a course of decision, and I am happy to sustain myself by the opinion of a very able judge, in a case very parallel to the present. In the case of <em>Blandford and others </em>v. <em>Fackerell, </em>before lord <em>Thurlow, </em>4 Bro. C. C. 393. it appeared that <em>Edward Fackerell, </em>by his will, having devised all his real estate to trustees, proceeded to direct that they should take a lease of a house, and fit it up for a school \u201c for the education of the children and grandchildren of his relations (naming them) and thqt they admit into the school such number of boys and girls as the income would be sufficient to educate.\u201d The provision in behalf of, the boys and gilds was pressed by the attorney general, who, however, contended that even if that were not valid, the trust was good as to the children and grandchildren, and might, as to them, <em>be separated </em>from the charity, <em>and go as far as by law it could. </em>He cited <em>Doe e. d. Philips </em>v. <em>Aldridge, </em>4 T. R. 264. The lord chancellor said, \u201c The first object of the testator is to give education to the children and grandchildren, and then that a benefit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>should arise to others from his bounty. I can only devise a plan for the objects of his bounty\u201d (he means the children and grandchildren, as the decree shews) \u201c and direct an inquiry who are such. As far as it tends to establish a general charity, it is void by the statutes of mortmain.\u201d It was accordingly declared that the devise and bequest was <em>void </em>as a devise for the general purposes of establishing a charity, but tha.t the children and grandchildren were entitled to the benefit of the dispositions in their favour, <em>so far as the objects thereof were not too remote. </em>No further authority can be necessary to shew that the court will effectuate a will so far as it can, though it lops off whatever is contrary to law or cannot be effectuated.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-3\">I am therefore of opinion, that the decree of the circuit court is dearly erroneous, and that the trust in this case is good, so fiar as it extends to the testator\u2019s family. We are not now called upon to decide who are comprehended by this term, nor whether the words \u201c who may be in distress\u201d are to be considered as applying to them. Nor are we called upon to limit or control the discretion of the executors as to the administration of the trust, or to hasten the execution of it by compelling them to proceed to sell &amp;c. Whether the court could interfere with the free exercise of their discretion, may be doubted. <em>3 </em>Cond. Eng. Ch. Rep. 482. But upon this subject I mean to give no decided opinion. The proper course for us is to reverse the decree with <em>costs; </em>and entering such decree as the circuit court should have made, the bill must be dismissed with costs, without prejudice to any proceeding which the plaintiffs or others may institute in relation to the execution of the trust.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-6\">Brooke, Cabelt. and Brookenbrougu, <em>J. </em>concurred in the opinion of the president.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-7\">Decree reversed and bill dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
