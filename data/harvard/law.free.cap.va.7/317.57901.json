The court overruled the motion, and the defendant filed a bill of exceptions, from which it appeared, that the facts proved in the cause were as follows :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b337-10\">One <em>Grattan </em>married a daughter of the plaintiff <em>Johnston, </em>in the state of <em>Tennessee, </em>where <em>Johnston </em>resided; and he contracted debts in <em>Tennessee </em>while there. Very shortly before <em>Grattan </em>and his wife left her father\u2019s house, for <em>Greenbrier </em>in <em>Virginia, </em>which was the place of <em>Grattan\u2019s </em>residence, <em>Johnston </em>got another son in law to draw a deed of loan of the slave in question (then about six years old) to <em>Grattan </em>and his wife, specifying that the girl was <em>lent </em>to them, and that they were to take <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>good care of her, and deliver her to <em>Johnston </em>when he \u00b0 should demand <em>her; </em>and this deed was signed by <em>Grattan </em>and his wife. (The deed was lost, but the execution of it, and its contents, were admitted by the defendant). A few minutes after the deed was executed, <em>Johnston, </em>having left the room with the subscribing witness thereto, and holding the deed in his hand, told the witness, that <em>Grattan </em>was largely indebted in <em>Tennessee, </em>and that he had taken this deed of loan, in order to shew that the girl was his property, should she be taken by <em>Grattan\u2019s </em>creditors while she remained in <em>Tennessee, </em>but that \u201che intended to give the girl to <em>Grattan </em>any how.\u201d A few hours after the deed was executed, <em>Grattan </em>and his wife, to whom the girl was delivered, set out to <em>Virginia </em>with the girl in their possession, and arrived in <em>Greenbrier </em>in June 1827. The deed was never recorded in <em>Virginia </em>or in <em>Tennessee. Grattan, </em>soon afterwards, having contracted1 a debt of 150 dollars to <em>Mahon, </em>the defendant, mortgaged the slave in question to him, to secure that debt, by deed dated the 30th June 1827. It was under this mortgage that the defendant claimed; <em>Grattan </em>having removed from <em>Virginia, </em>and before his removal delivered the slave to him. And such being the state of facts proved at the trial, the court overruled the motion for a new trial; being of opinion, that it belonged exclusively to the jury to say, whether the deed of loan was <em>bona fide </em>or fraudulent, or whether the delivery of the slave by the plaintiff <em>Johnston </em>to <em>Grattan </em>was in fact a <em>gift </em>not a <em>loan, </em>and the deed of loan only a pretext to secure the property from <em>Grattan\u2019s </em>creditors, while he was passing out of <em>Tennessee </em>into <em>Virginia.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b338-6\">The court then gave the plaintiff judgment upon the verdict; and the defendant appealed to this court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b338-7\"><em>Johnson, </em>for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b338-8\">No counsel for the appellee.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b339-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>Carr, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ayr\">I am of opinion, that upon the facts of this ca.se we cannot disturb the verdict oi the jury. There is no proof of a gift; on the contrary, the plaintiff took the precaution of a written acknowledgment from his son in law, that he received the girl as a loan; and though ho declared, afterwards, that he took the writing to protect the slave from <em>Grattan\u2019s </em>creditors while in <em>Tennessee, </em>that did not change it from a loan to a gift. Neither did the further declaration made by the plaintiff, that \u201c he intended to give the negro to <em>Grattan </em>any how,\u201d work such a change: since an intention to give is a very different thing from an actual gift. The judge spoke too broadly, when he said it belonged <em>exclusively </em>to the jury to decide, whether the deed of loan was <em>'bona fide </em>or fraudulent. Yet we ought not to reverse the judgment for that cause, if he was right on the whole in refusing the new trial; and I think he was; for the jury are certainly the appropriate triors of facts, and it is only in case of <em>\u201c </em>plain deviation,\u201d that a court ought to grant a new trial, on the ground of a verdict being contrary to the evidence. I am for affirming the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-5\">Brockenbrough and Cabell, <em>J. </em>concurred.</p>\n<author id=\"b339-6\">Tucker, P.</author>\n<p id=\"Apo\">In <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Handley, </em>decided this term,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> it was observed, that though parol gifts of slaves accompanied by possession were valid, yet that the evidence of such gift should be clear and entirely satisfactory, before it should be established. For, as the gift is without value received, it is but reasonable that the party who is ' to be deprived of bis property without an equivalent, should be clearly proved to have actually parted with it. This can never be done, where the evidence to establish the gift is altogether equivocal; and such is always the case with mere evidence of <em>possession, </em>in a transaction between a father and his child. Such pos<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>session being equally consistent with the idea of a <em>loan </em>or a gift) an&lt;i <em>both loans </em>and gifts under such circumstances, being common, the fact of possession does not seem to me to prove much. Had the facts stated in the bill of exceptions been submitted for my own decision, I think I should have said with the jury,\u2014\u201c this <em>gift </em>is not satisfactorily proved.\u201d But be this as it may, that tribunal, to which it most properly belonged to decide this question, having so found, the court properly refused to disturb a verdict which, at most, cannot be said to be clearly against the evidence. The judgment must be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-4\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b339-7\"> Reported <em>ante, </em>p. 119.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
