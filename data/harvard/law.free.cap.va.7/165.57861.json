He cited, and examined, <em>Simon </em>v. <em>Motivos, </em>1 W. Blacks. 599. 3 Burr. 1921. <em>Emmerson </em>v. <em>Heelis, </em>2 Taunt. 38. <em>White </em>v. <em>Proctor, </em>4 Id. 208. <em>Kemeys </em>v. <em>Proctor, </em>3 Ves. &amp; Beam. 57. 1 Jac. &amp; Walk. 350. <em>M\u2019Comb </em>v. <em>Wright, </em>4 Johns.

And he said, that however the recent adjudications might sustain the doctrine, it had been so much disapproved, and by such able jurists, that it could not be regarded as settled. He argued, that it could not be reconciled with the letter or policy of the statute of frauds, and was in principle unsound, and unsafe in its consequences. It assumed for fact what might or might not be true; namely, that the auctioneer, though appointed by the vendor alone, was not only his agent, but the agent of the vendee, who had no share in constituting him the agent; whereas, in point of fact, the auctioneer was rarely, if ever, regarded by the vendee, selected, trusted, or in any substantial sense authorized by him, as his agent. He was only' the agent o\u00ed\u2019 the vendor. The statute gave the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>purchaser of land the <em>locus penitentice, </em>till he deliberately <em>. , , . </em>. , . . <em>r </em>signed, or authorized another to sign, a written note ot the contract: but this doctrine took the <em>locus penitentice </em>from him, by constituting an agent to sign for him, whom he never thought of constituting for himself.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b188-5\"><em>Johnson </em>cited</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"APfo\">the recent case of <em>Brent </em>v. <em>Green, </em>in this court (since reported, 6 Leigh 16.) as conclusive on this point.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b188-6\">II. <em>Robinson </em>said, that, supposing the entry by the <em>auctioneer, </em>of the purchaser\u2019s name, the price &amp;c. in his account of sales, a memorandum in <em>writing signed by </em>the purchaser, within the meaning of the statute; here, the (so called) <em>auctioneer </em>did not make the entry. It was made by a <em>clerk, </em>supposed to be the auctioneer\u2019s clerk. And the court, to sustain this decree, must go the length of holding, not only that the auctioneer was the agent of the purchaser, but that agent\u2019s agent also was the purchaser\u2019s agent. The auctioneer\u2019s clerk might indeed be specially authorized by the vendor or the vendee or both; but, in general, clerks have no such authority. <em>Coles </em>v. <em>Trecothick, </em>9 Ves. 249. 251. If this deputation, by a constructive agent, of a sub-agent should be allowed, where, he asked, was the principle of deputation to end ?</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b188-7\"><em>Johnson </em>answered,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A98\">that such a distinction, if admitted, would, to all practical purposes, explode the principle. It was impracticable, that the auctioneer should at once make the sales, and keep the account of them. And the purchaser standing by, bidding while the auctioneer was crying, and seeing the clerk employed in entering the sales as they were made, adopted the clerk as his agent.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b188-8\">III. <em>Robinson </em>said, that the proof of the allegations of the bill consisted in the deposition of <em>Knox. </em>It would be remarked, that <em>Knox </em>used the phrases <em>auctioneer </em>and <em>cryer, </em>as convertible terms. The same person might, indeed, be both; but they were not always or generally <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>so. Considering <em>Knox s </em>evidence with due regard to . ... ,, , , the nature and history o\u00ed the transaction, the <em>cryer </em>was not an <em>auctioneer </em>in the sense in which an auctioneer has been considered as the agent both of vendor and vendee, but a <em>mere cryer; </em>and the clerk was not the servant or agent of the cryer, nor employed by him, but the servant or agent of <em>Knox, </em>the agent of the vendor. He said, an auctioneer was an agent entrusted to make the sales, not merely to cry the bids. Here, <em>Knox, </em>the vendor\u2019s agent, was present in person superintending the sale : the bill itself alleged, that he conducted the sale. <em>Knox </em>deposed, that the entry on the account of sales was made by <em>Ball, </em>then acting as clerk of the cryer; but he did not su,y that the cryer appointed this clerk; and it was absurd to suppose, that a person appointed at a country sale as cryer, was trusted to select a clerk to keep the account of sales, when the vendor\u2019s chosen agent to conduct them was present. There could be no doubt that <em>Knox </em>appointed the clerk, and the clerk was <em>Knox's </em>agent. Therefore, the memorandum made by the clerk was exactly the same thing as if it had been made by <em>Knox </em>himself; and if it had been made by <em>Knox, </em>that would have been the same as if it had been made by his principal, the vendor himself. If this view of the facts was right, this was not a note in writing of the contract signed by a person thereto authorized by the vendee, within the meaning of the statute of frauds.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b189-8\"><em>Johnson </em>answered,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AmAz\">that it was impossible to allow any substantial distinction between an auctioneer and cryer; but here the proof was, that he was both auctioneer and cryer. It was proved too, that <em>Ball </em>was \u201c acting as the clerk of the cryerthe purchaser did not inquire of the witness, who it was that appointed the clerk, and could not avail himself of a supposed fact, which he took no pains to prove. But, putting <em>Knox, </em>the agent of the vendor, in the place of the <em>auctioneer, </em>and regard<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>ing the cryer and the clerk as his servants, and the note <em>? . </em>. oi the contract as having been signed with <em>Smith s </em>name by <em>Knox </em>by the hand of <em>his clerk, </em>he relied on the case of <em>Brent </em>v. <em>Green, </em>as directly in point to shew, that the memorandum of the contract was signed by <em>Smith's </em>authority, within the meaning of the statute.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b190-5\">IV. <em>Robinson </em>said, that the supposed note in writing did not state truly and fully the terms of the contract, as appeared by the plaintiff\u2019s own shewing in his bill: the memorandum represented it as a sale for cash; the bill, that it was a sale on twelve months credit. He cited <em>Hinde </em>v. <em>Whitehouse, </em>7 East <em>558. Blagden v. Bradbear, </em>12 Ves. 466. <em>Kenworthy </em>v. <em>Scofield, </em>2 Barn. &amp; Cress. 945. 9 Eng. C. L. Rep. 286. <em>Parkhurst </em>v. <em>Van Cortland, </em>1 Johns. Ch. Rep. 273. 14 Johns. Rep. 32. S. C.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b190-6\"><em>Johnson </em>answered,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AWOq\">that the allegation of the bill as to the terms, only made the contract more favourable to the purchaser, than the written note of it; the note authorizing the vendor to claim cash, and the bill admitting that the vendee was entitled to twelve months credit. In many of the english cases that had been cited, the notes of contract were as much, or more, exposed to the imputation of uncertainty in regard to the terms, yet the objection did not avail; as in <em>Emmerson </em>v. <em>Heelis </em>and <em>White </em>v. <em>Proctor: </em>and, certainly, such an objection lay much more strongly against the contract in <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Ronald's adm\u2019r, </em>4 Munf. 77. and yet there the court decreed specific execution.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b190-7\">Beockenbrotjgh, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AsH\">The first question discussed in this case, was much investigated at the bar and by this court, in <em>Brent </em>v. <em>Green. </em>The court adopted the decisions in <em>Emmerson </em>v. <em>Heelis, </em>2 Taunt. 46. and <em>White </em>v. <em>Proctor, </em>4 Taunt. 211. as settling the law, that in sales at public auctions, the auctioneer was to be considered as the lawfully authorized agent of the purchaser as well as of the vendor, and that a note or memorandum <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>in writing of the agreement between the vendor and vendee, signed by such agent, was a sufficient signing within the statute of frauds, and was binding on both parties.</p>\n<p id=\"AN\">The objection that the memorandum in this case was signed, not by the auctioneer but by the clerk, ought not, I think, to prevail. He was the clerk of the auctioneer,\u2014his amanuensis,\u2014and wrote the memorandum on the account of sales by his direction and under his superintendence. In all extensive auction sales, a clerk is indispensably necessary, and the employment of one is safest for both vendor and vendee. Great inconvenience would be experienced, and much mischief done, if we were to decide, that a memorandum signed by the auctioneer\u2019s clerk, was not as complete a compliance with the statute, as the signature by the auctioneer himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-8\">The remaining question is, whether the memorandum of the sale, made as it was by the lawfully authorized agent of the purchaser, be a sufficient memorandum or note of the contract for the sale of the land in the bill mentioned, to charge the defendant, and to entitle the plaintiff to a specific execution of the contract. The cases of <em>Hinde </em>v. <em>Whitehouse </em>and <em>Kenworthy </em>v. <em>Scofield, </em>were relied on to shew, that when such memorandum is made, the terms or conditions of the sale should either be embraced therein, or that the written or printed paper which contains the conditions of sale, should be annexed to the paper on which the memorandum is made, and before it is made, or be referred to by it. I admit that those cases are very strong to that effect; yet I do not think they should govern this case. I am of opinion, that the memorandum before us does contain the terms or conditions of the sale. Take the memorandum by itself, without referring to the parol evidence, and every one would understand, that <em>Smith </em>did purchase <em>The Fox tract of land, </em>for $ 4 10 <em>per acre, pay</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number><em>able in ready money. </em>The terms of the sale, then, are expressed in the writing. The defendant bound himself to pay in cash. If it is alleged, that the memorandum does not contain the true terms, 1 admit it. But the mistake or falsehood in the memorandum does not invalidate the contract under the statute of frauds and perjuries. The statute is complied with. If the vendor had claimed a specific performance of this contract for cash, equity would have relieved the vendee, not because the statute was not complied with, but because of the mistake as to the terms, or the fraud of the vendor in stating false terms; and it would allow the vendee to give parol evidence of that mistake or falsehood. There is, however, no necessity for such relief here, because the vendor has in his bill honestly stated the true terms, and they are more favourable to the vendee than those contained in the memorandum. He cannot complain of the mistake, as it is rectified by the plaintiff in his bill, and there is no ground to charge the plaintiff with fraud.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-4\">I think the decree should be affirmed.</p>\n<author id=\"b192-5\">Garb, <em>J.</em></author>\n<p id=\"A5_\">Two questions were raised and well discussed, in this case : 1. Was there a signing within the statute of frauds ? 2. Was the contract so certain in its terms as to authorize a specific execution ? Upon the first question we were referred to the case of <em>Brent </em>v. <em>Green; </em>where a deputy sheriff, acting for the high sheriff, under our insolvent law, sold at auction the interest of an insolvent debtor in a tract of land contained in his schedule, and when the land was knocked down to the purchaser, he wrote on the schedule the price of the land, and the purchaser\u2019s name : and we decided, on a full discussion, and reference to all the authorities, that this was a sufficient signing of a memorandum in writing under the statute, to bind the purchaser. That case is exactly in point to this, as to the signing; for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>here, there was a sale at public auction, of many suc<em>h , . </em>articles of property as are for sale when a farm is broken up, and the land itself was also sold. The sales were conducted by <em>Knox </em>the agent of <em>Jones. </em>A regular account of sales was kept by the clerk, who set down the sale of the land, the price, and the name of the purchaser. Here, then, is the name of the purchaser set to a memorandum in writing, stating that he had bought The Fox tract of land at $ 4 10 per acre; and his name thus signed by the auctioneer. 1 shall not go over again here, the numerous cases which settle the question that the auctioneer is an agent for the vendee authorized to sign his name ; but 1 will just repeat what is so briefly and strongly said by <em>Mansfield, </em>C. J. in <em>Emmerson </em>v. <em>Heelis, 2 </em>Taunt. 46. \u201c By what authority does he (the auctioneer) write down the purchaser\u2019s name ? By the authority of the purchaser. Those persons bid, and announce their biddings loudly and particularly enough to be heard by the auctioneer. For what purpose do they do this ? that he may write down their names opposite to the lots; therefore, he writes the name by authority of the purchaser, and he. is an agent for the purchaser; and it does seem, therefore, that this is a contract, signed by an agent for the purchaser, and consequently binding.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b193-9\">It was objected, that the name was not written by the hand of the <em>agent </em>but of his <em>clerk. </em>The cases consider this as making no difference, the clerk acting immediately under the eye of his principal. In <em>White </em>v. <em>Proctor, Mansfield, </em>C. J. answers an objection of this kind thus\u2014\u201c If an agent has cut his finger so that he cannot write, and says to another, write down my name, will not that signature bind the principal ?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b193-11\">The second question is, whether the memorandum has sufficient certainty to authorize its specific execution. The two cases above cited say, that entering the name of the buyer in the auctioneer\u2019s book, is just the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>same thing as if the buyer had written his own name. <em>\u00b0 </em>i . . . bup'pose, then, we throw this agreement mto the form ^ would have assumed, if written by <em>Smith </em>himself<em>: </em>\u201cMemorandum, that I, <em>J. Smith, </em>have bought of <em>W. Knox </em>agent for <em>W. Jones, The Fox tract of land, at $4 </em>10 per acre. (Signed) <em>J. Smith.\u201d </em>It will be seen, that there is not a single term here, which is not stated in the heading of the account of sales, and the entry of the sale of the land. Now, to my mind, this presents an agreement sufficiently certain for specific execution. The thing bought and sold, the terms of sale, and the buyer are distinctly set forth. It is objected, that we are not told whether it is a sale for cash or credit. I question much, whether this objection would have occurred, even to the acute mind of the counsel, if the bill had not stated, that the terms in the advertisement were twelve months credit. But this statement is not supported; we see nothing of the advertisement; it is in no way made part of the case. Whether to supply it by parol proof would have been permitted, is a question which does not arise, as no such attempt was made-. Taking the memorandum on its face, it presents no such uncertainty. There being no time limited either for paying the price or executing the deed, the conclusion is, that either party may presently insist on carrying the contract into execution. The vendee might tender his money and demand a deed, or the vendor tender his deed and demand the money, without delay. It will be remembered, that this is not an objection that the <em>allegata </em>and <em>probata </em>do not agree; that the plaintiff has not properly described the agreement; <em>but that the </em>agreement itself, as it actually exists, is not sufficiently certain to take the case out of the statute of frauds. If we look at the many english cases which have been decided on this point, I think we shall find few with more certainty, many with less, that have been supported by the courts : in my opinion, <em>Emmerson </em>v. <em>Heelis </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>and <em>White </em>v. <em>Proctor, </em>have not more. If we look into \u2022 our own cases, we find several with less certainty than this, specifically executed. I shall only refer to <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Ronald\u2019s adm\u2019r.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b195-5\">Cabell and Bkooke, J. concurred. Decree affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
