Therefore, the bill prayed a discovery from the defendants, of the execution of the bond, and of the transfer thereof to <em>Stewart, </em>and such relief as he should be found entitled to. This bill was not verified by affidavit; nor was any affidavit filed <em>'with the hill, </em>of the fact of the bond being lost.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b149-4\"><em>Scruggs, </em>in his answer, said, that the bond in question was executed by <em>Thornton </em>to him for the purchase money of land sold by him to <em>Thornton, </em>which he had bought of one <em>Harper; </em>that <em>Harper </em>bad never conveyed it to him <em>; </em>but that <em>Thornton </em>was apprised of the defect of title, and of <em>Scruggs\u2019s </em>inability to convey a good title, and expressly agreed, that he would take <em>Scruggs\u2019s </em>right, such as it was, and that the defect in the title should not preclude <em>Scruggs </em>from receiving the purchase money; and that <em>Thornton </em>took immediate possession of the land, and had held undisturbed possession ever since. He answered further, as to the transfer of the bond to <em>Stewart, </em>that he <em>Scruggs </em>owing a debt to one <em>Varnum, </em>and <em>Stewart </em>being <em>Varnum\u2019s </em>agent for the collection of .it, this bond of <em>Thornton </em>was put into <em>Stewart\u2019s </em>hands, upon condition, that if <em>Scruggs </em>should not pay the debt due <em>Varnum, </em>on a day appointed when <em>Stewart </em>was to come to <em>Scruggs\u2019s </em>house, <em>Stewart </em>should have <em>Thornton\u2019s </em>bond, without recourse against <em>Scruggs; </em>but <em>Stewart </em>did not come to <em>Scruggs\u2019s </em>house, at the appointed time, or afterwards; nor (so far as <em>Scruggs </em>was informed) had he paid the debt due <em>Varnum; </em>and <em>Scruggs </em>did not know what had become of the bond.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b149-6\"><em>Thornton, </em>in his answer, admitted the execution of the bond to <em>Scruggs; </em>but he said, it was given for the purchase money of land, for which <em>Scruggs </em>stipulated to convey him a good title before the purchase money should bo paid; that though <em>Scruggs </em>pretended to have a good title, he had no title; that the title was in one <em>Harper, </em>supposed to be a resident of the state of <em>Geor</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number><em>gia; </em>that <em>Thornton </em>was not bound to pay the money due on thg bon(J}, till the title was perfected ; that one <em>Loving </em>had once shewn him the bond, and'applied for payment, but for the reasons here mentioned, he had refused payment.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b150-4\">There was a general replication to <em>Thornton\u2019s </em>answer, but no replication to the answer of <em>Scruggs.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b150-5\">A single deposition was taken and filed, in which the deponent stated, that at <em>Stewart's </em>request, he had once applied to <em>Scruggs </em>for some money which <em>Stewart </em>said <em>Scruggs </em>owed him; whereupon <em>Scruggs </em>said, that he had discharged the debt he owed <em>Stewart </em>with <em>Thornton\u2019s </em>bond, which <em>Stewart </em>had traded away; and <em>Scruggs </em>would pay him nothing more.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b150-6\">The cause was set for hearing in the county court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b150-7\">And in this state of it, it was removed to the superiour court of chancery; and there, many years after the commencement of the suit, the plaintiff made and filed an affidavit, that the bond, at the time of the exhibition of the bill, and still, was lost, and that he had no hope of ever finding it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b150-8\">The chancellor, upon a hearing, decreed, that <em>Thornton </em>should pay <em>Stewart </em>the amount of the lost bond with interest, and the costs of the suit.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b150-9\">At the next term, <em>Thornton, </em>with leave of the court, filed a bill of review for errors apparent in the record and decree, <em>viz. </em>1. Because it was stated in the bill, that the bond alleged to be lost, was given for the purchase money of land sold by <em>Scruggs </em>to <em>Thornton, </em>and this was admitted by <em>Scruggs </em>in his answer, who also admitted that he had no title to the land, and that the title was outstanding in <em>Harper. 2. </em>Because interest on the bond was decreed, though <em>Thornton </em>was nowise in fault, there being no proof of the allegation of the bill, that <em>Stewart </em>had offered to indemnify him against the bond in case it should 'afterwards be found. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>3. Because <em>Stewart </em>and <em>Scruggs </em>differed as to the fact \u00b0 . <em>1 </em>of the transfer of the bond by the one to the other; and the decree would not protect <em>Thornton </em>against any claim which <em>Scruggs </em>might assert upon the bond; since the cause had not been set for hearing as to him, nor was there any replication to his answer. 4. Because the decree was made before the cause was properly matured for hearing as to any of the parties. 5. Because <em>Harper, </em>who held the title of the land for the purchase money whereof the lost bond was given, ought to have been made a party defendant. Wherefore, the bill prayed, that the decree should be reviewed and reversed &amp;c.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b151-6\">To this bill of review <em>Stewart </em>put in an answer, in which, after denying that there was any error or injustice in the proceedings and decree, he alleged, that <em>Thornton </em>had purchased the land from <em>Scruggs </em>for the price whereof the lost bond was executed, with full knowledge of the defect of <em>Scruggs's </em>title, and therefore, notwithstanding the defect, he was bound to pay the purchase money; that <em>Thornton </em>had repeatedly promised payment thereof to <em>Stewart, </em>and never objected to pay the debt on the ground of such failure of the consideration, till shortly before the commencement of the original suit in the county court; that there was not, and never was, any disagreement between him and <em>Scruggs, </em>as to the transfer of the bond to him for valuable consideration; that <em>Thornton </em>had been in possession of the land sold him by <em>Scruggs, </em>for more than twenty years, and was in no danger of disturbance from <em>Harper, </em>but <em>Stewart </em>was willing to indemnify him against <em>Harper's </em>claim; and that the decree of the court had rendered substantial justice in the case, and therefore it ought not now to be disturbed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b151-7\">To this answer of <em>Stewart, </em>a general replication was put in; <em>Scruggs </em>made default; and. the cause having been set for hearing as to both of them, the chancellor dismissed the bill of review.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"Ax_\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number><em>Thornton </em>appealed to this court from the decree on the original bill, and from the decree on the bill of review.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b152-9\"><em>Johnson </em>and <em>Robinson, </em>for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ax6\">The original bill being a bill for relief on a lost bond, should have been accompanied with an affidavit that the bond was lost; 2 Rob. Prac.! 39. 40. where the authorities are collected. Without such an affidavit, equhy could not take jurisdiction of such a bill; and, therefore, the affidavit \u25a0subsequently made does not help the case. But if this objection was obviated by the subsequent affidavit, the decree on the original bill was clearly wrong, and consequently the decree on the bill of review was wrong too. -The original bill alleged, that the consideration of <em>Thornton's </em>bond to <em>Scruggs, </em>was the purchase money of land sold him by <em>Scruggs; </em>and <em>Scruggs's </em>answer admitted that, this consideration had wholly failed ; for all that was said in <em>Scruggs's </em>answer, as to <em>Thornton?s </em>being apprised of his want of title to the land, and agreeing to purchase his right whatever it was, were affirmative allegations, which, as there was no proof of them, the chancellor ought to have disregarded altogether; and putting those allegations out of the case, it is plain, <em>Thornton </em>was not in equity bound to pay off the bond. As the bond was certainly given for the price of land for which <em>Scruggs </em>had no title, and of which the title was in <em>Harper, Harper </em>should have been made a party, in-order that the title might be perfected, before <em>Thornton </em>should be compelled to pay the money. The original decree was wrong too, in giving costs against <em>Thornton, </em>who certainly was in no default; and in ordering <em>Thornton </em>to pay the money, without providing any indemnification to him, against future demands of others claiming title to the bond, and all costs and damages ; <em>East India Co. </em>v. <em>Boddam, </em>9 Ves. 464. These are fatal errors in the original proceedings and decree. And they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>are errors proper to be corrected on a bill of review; . . <em>1 </em>. . but it is immaterial whether the bill ot review was the proper remedy or no, since the cause is before this court on an appeal from both decrees. <em>Stewart\u2019s </em>answer to the bill of review, was wholly irregular, so far as it contained new allegations of fact.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b153-5\">Garland, for the appellees.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AzS\">The original decree, and the decree on the review, are both right. The original bill alleged, that <em>Thornton\u2019s </em>bond to <em>Scruggs </em>was given for the price of land sold by <em>Scruggs </em>to <em>Thornton; </em>and this <em>Thornton </em>admitted in his answer. He added, indeed, that the consideration had failed, because <em>Scruggs </em>had no title to the land sold; but this was an affirmative allegation of the answer, of which no proof was adduced or attempted ; for <em>Scruggs\u2019s </em>answer was not evidence for <em>Thornton. </em>It was, then, the simple case of the holder of a bond alleging that it was lost, and asking the chancellor to set it up, and the obligor acknowledging the execution of the bond, but seeking to avoid the obligation of it, by merely alleging, without even attempting to prove, that the consideration for which it was given had failed. If <em>Scruggs\u2019s </em>answer can be referred to, as evidence for <em>Thornton </em>that the title of the land was defective, its other allegations were proper evidence, against him; and then the decrees were clearly right. <em>Harper </em>had no interest in the controversy; and therefore, need not ha,ve been brought before the court. As to the affidavit of the loss of the bond, there was one; and the only objection is, that it was not filed with the bill, but in the progress of the cause afterwards: but as the only purpose of requiring an affidavit in such cases, is to prevent the suppression of the bond by the plaintiff in order to conceal a receipt, or credit, or some other entry upon it that may change its effect, if the affidavit was filed, it is to every substantial purpose immaterial when it was filed.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"A1q\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>Tucker, <em>P.</em></author>\n<p id=\"ASX\">Both decrees in this case are palpably T . ..... , erroneous. 1 <em>do not </em>concur m the objection to the as-, sumption of jurisdiction, being satisfied with the affidavit of <em>Stewart </em>as to the loss of the bond; for though it was not filed with the bill, it is one of those defects, which, I think, may well be supplied in the progress of the cause, where there has been no demurrer to the bill for want of it. But upon the pleadings and proofs, <em>Stewart </em>was entitled to no decree against either defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-6\">1. As to <em>Thornton. </em>He confesses the bond, but alleges it was given for land, the title of which is imperfect. Both facts appear .from the answer of <em>Scruggs, </em>the vendor of <em>Thornton, </em>and the assignor of <em>Stewart; </em>but <em>Scruggs </em>goes on to say, that <em>Thornton </em>took the risque of title, and had enjoyed uninterrupted possession. Both these allegations are of new and independent matter, which cannot be taken as true until proved. Moreover, the bill itself states, that <em>Scruggs </em>knew the consideration of the bond was insufficient, and therefore refused to do any thing for its recovery. Here, then, is sufficient to protect <em>Thornton, </em>unless by other evidence a new aspect should be given to the'case. <em>2. </em>As to <em>Scruggs: </em>he admits the transfer of the bond to <em>Stewart, </em>for a consideration which is not proved to have been paid, nor has <em>Stewart </em>proved any other consideration. No decree therefore could go against <em>Scruggs, </em>even though <em>Stewart </em>failed against <em>Thornton.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b154-7\">The matters stated in <em>Stewart's </em>answer to the bill of review, are entirely new; and it is quite an anomaly, oh a bill of review for error upon the face of the proceedings, to introduce by way of answer, new facts and hew grounds of demand, not stated or appearing in the .cause sought to be reviewed.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-8\">I am clear, therefore, that both decrees must be reversed. What then should be done ? Should <em>Stewart's </em>bill be dismissed ? I think not. That cause should go <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>back, and an issue should be directed to try the matters litigated between <em>Scruggs </em>and <em>Thornton, </em>relative to the bond.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-5\">The other judges concurred. Both decrees reversed with costs; and the court proceeding to enter such decree as ought to have been entered on the bill of review, directs that the decree in <em>the </em>original cause <em>be </em>reversed and annulled, and that the cause be remanded for further proceedings, according to the principles here declared.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
