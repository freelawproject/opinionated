At the time of making this deed, it seems to have been supposed that the legal title to those lands yet remained in the said <em>Allyn Prior, </em>subject to tlie lien of <em>Thomas Edgar.

The <em>subpoena </em>issued on the 5th of October 1821, and the bill was filed in April following. The bill is in the names of <em>Andrew Lewis, Allyn Prior </em>and <em>Thomas Edgar, </em>and makes <em>David </em>and <em>Joseph Ruffner, John Reynolds </em>and <em>Edward Graham </em>defendants thereto. It charges that at the time of the execution of the, agreement of the 1st of March 1805, the <em>Ruffners </em>were well apprised of the claim of <em>Prior </em>and <em>Reynolds </em>under the deed of September 8th 1801, and insists that the land conveyed by that deed is not, upon any fair construction of the agreement, embraced thereby. Nevertheless the <em>Ruffners </em>took possession of the land so conveyed to <em>Prior </em>and <em>Reynolds, </em>when they obtained possession of the land really embraced by the agreement. It alleges that the <em>Ruffners, </em>for the fraudulent purpose of defeating the claim of <em>Prior </em>and <em>Reynolds, </em>colluded with the executor of <em>William Griffith </em>and <em>Joseph Alderson </em>the brother and acting executor of <em>George Alderson, </em>to obtain an assignment of the trust deed, instead of a mere release; and this they did, whilst they retained in their hands the whole purchase money agreed by them to be paid to the said <em>George, </em>and were therefore at all times in possession of ample funds of the said <em>George, </em>to pay off the amount secured by the trust deed. The plaintiffs contend that notwithstanding the attempt to get a title by assignment, the trust deed is in law extinguished by the transaction. Even if the trust remained in force, they contend that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"727\">*727</page-number>after the death of <em>George Aldcrson, </em>the trustee could not legally proceed without the aid of a court of chancery in appointing commissioners to divide the land, and that the whole of the proceedings in relation to the appointment of commissioners, the designation of the part to be sold, and the sale itself, were irregular and illegal. The bill prays that a moiety of the ten acres may be decreed to <em>Lewis </em>as claiming under <em>Prior, </em>that a division may be made between <em>Lewis </em>and <em>Reynolds, </em>that an account be taken of the rents and profits, and <em>Prior\u2019s </em>share thereof paid to <em>Lewis; or </em>if there can be no decree in favour of <em>Leivis, </em>that it be made in <em>Prior\u2019s </em>favour; and that the land to be decreed to him be sold to pay <em>Edgar\u2019s </em>judgment, and then the residue of the proceeds, with the rents and profits, paid over to <em>Lewis, </em>for the remaining purposes of the trust.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b747-4\">The defendant <em>.David Ruffner </em>demurred to the bill, assigning for cause, first, that the interest of <em>Prior </em>became vested by law in the sheriff of <em>Kanawha </em>upon his taking the oath of an insolvent debtor, and yet the sheriff of <em>Kanawha </em>was no party to the bill; secondly, that as to the complainant <em>Andrew Lewis, </em>no interest, either in law or equity, in the land or its proceeds is shewn to be in him, because the deed dated the 20th of September 1821 is void in law and equity, being made in opposition to and violation of the public law against conveying or taking pretensed titles, and made, too, for the purpose and with the view of maintaining, supporting, and carrying on law suits and encouraging litigation, and because none of the parties executing that deed could convey to <em>Lewis </em>any of <em>Prior\u2019s </em>former claims to the land or its proceeds, the same having been vested by law in the sheriff of <em>Kanawha, </em>and not shewn to be out of him.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b747-5\">The said defendant <em>David Ruffner </em>then proceeding to answer, stated that the purchase by himself and <em>Joseph Ruffner, </em>on the 1st of March 1805, was of the whole of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"728\">*728</page-number>the survey of land in <em>Kanawha </em>that <em>George Alderson </em>lived on (and not merely of a part thereof) together with a part of an adjoining <em>tract; </em>and in order that the land he then lived on mightbefreedfromallincumwhatever, it was stipulated that said <em>George </em>was to deliver to this defendant and said <em>Joseph Ruffner </em>the deed of trust to secure certain payments to <em>William Griffith. </em>The answer then set forth, that shortly after the purchase, upon the said <em>George\u2019s </em>suggestion, that he would be unable, of his own means, to procure the deed of trust and deliver it over, unless some aid was afforded him, <em>Joseph Ruffner </em>paid to him 150 dollars in cash, and about the same time 160 dollars in brandy and whiskey, which was in part payment of the purchase. These funds, instead of being appropriated by said George as they were intended, were applied by him entirely to other purposes. A short time after the death of the said <em>George, </em>defendant and said <em>Joseph, </em>for the first time discovering that the land had been still further encumbered by a title bond executed on the 21st of September 1802 by said <em>George to Joseph Aider-son, </em>purchased the bond from said <em>Joseph </em>for \u00bf\u00a3200. for which they executed their two notes to said <em>Joseph, </em>which notes they afterwards discharged. Being still desirous to procure the deed of trust before mentioned, they got <em>Joseph Alderson, </em>who lived in <em>Monroe </em>county, where the executor of <em>William Griffith </em>also lived, but who was frequently coming down to <em>Kanawha, </em>where this defendant and <em>Joseph Ruffner </em>lived, to purchase it for them, which was done, and (as this defendant believes) the deed of trust assigned over to them. For this assignment they paid the amount, or nearly the amount, of the sum secured to said <em>Griffith. </em>Defen- ' dant and said <em>Joseph </em>considered the payments before mentioned as amounting to the \u00bf\u00a3500. they had engaged to give <em>George Alderson.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b749-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"729\">*729</page-number>In the progress of the cause the plaintiffs <em>Allyn Prior </em>and <em>Thomas Edgar </em>having died, the suit was revived in the name of the administrator and heirs of the former, and the executors of the latter.

On consideration whereof, the court, being of opinion that the defendants <em>David </em>and <em>Joseph Ruffner </em>had acquired no right to the land in the bill mentioned, either by their contract of March 1805 with <em>George Alderson, </em>or by the proceedings of the trustee <em>Edward Graham </em>under the trust deed of the 25th of July 1801, and that <em>Allyn Prior </em>and those claiming under him were entitled to a moiety of the said land, decreed, that the land, as described in the deed of the 8th of September .1.801 from <em>George Alderson </em>to <em>Allyn Prior </em>and <em>John Reynolds, </em>be divided into two equal moieties by certain commissioners appointed for the purpose, and that they assign one moiety to the plaintiff <em>Andrew Lewis. </em>The court also directed a master commissioner to take an account of the rents and profits of the land embraced in the deed of the 8th of September 1801 (deducting the value of the permanent improvements), which the defendants had or might have received from the first day of January 1806 to the time of taking the account; also from the first day of October 1811,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"730\">*730</page-number>from the 6th day of October 1816,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> to the same time ; <em>. . </em>\u201e stating a moiety of each.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AWuu\">A report was afterwards returned by the commissioners appointed to divide the land, and a decree pron0uj}ced thereupon on the 27th of November 1830. A particular moiety of the land, with an undivided moiety of the salt well, was assigned to <em>Lewis ; </em>and it appearing by a deed filed in the cause, of the date of February 27th 1830, and by other evidence, that the defendant <em>John Reynolds </em>had conveyed all his interest in the land to the defendant <em>David Ruffner, </em>it was decreed that the defendants <em>David </em>and <em>Joseph Ruffner </em>and <em>Edward Graham, </em>by <em>Matthew Dunbar </em>of <em>Kanawha, </em>who was appointed a commissioner for the purpose, should convey said moiety of the land, with an undivided moiety of the salt well, to <em>Lewis, </em>with special warranty, together with the right of piping the water thereof, to the extent of his interest in the salt well, to the said moiety of the land, so that he should have the fair and free use and enjoyment of his undivided moiety of the salt well.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b750-7\">On the motion of the defendants <em>David </em>and <em>Joseph Ruffner, </em>the master commissioner, in taking the account before directed, was authorized to state an account of the expenditures of the defendants in procuring or endeavouring to procure salt water.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b750-8\">Many depositions were taken before the commissioner, and he made a report stating very fully his views of the case. The following were the results exhibited by the report. The <em>first </em>statement shewed that by his estimate the rents received, or which might have been received, by the defendants, from the first day of January 1806 to the date at which possession was relinquished to the plaintiffs in the winter of 1830-31, amounted to 12,040 dollars 33 cents, and that, deducting 3333 dollars 75 cents for permanent improvements, there remained, for the rents from the first of January <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"731\">*731</page-number>1806, a balance of 8706 dollars 58 cents, of which the moiety is 4353 dollars 29 cents. The <em>second </em>statement shewed that by his estimate the rents received, or which might have been received, by the defendants, from the 1st of October 1811, after deducting for permanent im-1 provements, amounted to 6199 dollars 66 cents, of which the moiety is 3099 dollars 83 cents. The <em>third </em>statement shewed that by his estimate the rents from the 3d day of October 1816, after deducting for permanent improvements, amounted to 4319 dollars 71 cents, of which the moiety is 2159 dollars 85 cents.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b751-5\">To the report of the commissioner the defendants filed six exceptions, among which were the following:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b751-6\">\u201c Fourth exception. The defendants are advised that they are entitled to compensation for the expense and trouble of the experiments made by them for obtaining salt water in 1806-7. The experiments were made upon the land in controversy, and without them salt water by boring would not, in all probability, have been obtained. They were necessary, and ultimately led to the great discovery by which the land in part owned by the complainants became extremely valuable. The defendants insist that the complainants ought not to be entitled to a full share of the benefits of these experiments, without bearing a corresponding part of the expenses attending them. <em>The </em>report excluding defendants from any compensation for these expenditures is excepted to.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b751-7\">Fifth exception. The defendants are further advised that they are entitled to compensation for the cost of erecting a furnace &amp;c. as well as the cost of furnaces repaired or subsequently erected on the lot in controversy. The furnace was indispensably necessary to the manufacture of salt, and formed part of the subject for the use of which rent was paid. The furnaces were of the kind regarded as permanent, although they have long since gone to ruin. But if they are regarded as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"732\">*732</page-number>mere temporary structures for the purposes of trade, still the complainant, as a joint owner of the land with the defendants, and claiming an equal portion of the profits, ought to defray an equal portion of the costs, jf ke c|ajms nothing in the furnace, he ought to have none of the profits accruing from it; and a fair criterion to ascertain what amount of rent he ought to have, would be the price at which the land would have rented without the furnaces or any of the fixtures, the tenant making them for himself.

And then the cause being again heard upon the report and exceptions, the court rescinded the order of the 16th of May 1833, overruled all the exceptions of the defendants, adopted the <em>second </em>statement in the report, and pronounced a final decree in favour of the plaintiffs against <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"733\">*733</page-number>the defendants <em>David </em>and <em>Joseph Rvffner, </em>for the sum of 3099 dollars 83 cents, the moiety mentioned in that state-merit, which sum, when received by the plaintiffs, it was declared would constitute in their hands a fund in trust to be applied towards the payment of the debts embraced in and secured by the trust deed of the 20th of September 1821, according to the provisions thereof, and the rights of the several creditors named therein. And the defendants <em>David </em>and <em>Joseph Rvffner </em>were decreed to pay the plaintiffs their costs, except the costs of the division of the lot and premises, which were to be borne equally by the parties. From this decree an appeal was allowed, on the petition of <em>David </em>and <em>Joseph Rvffner.</em></summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b753-4\"><em>Johnson </em>and <em>B.

They have come into equity against defendants holding adversely to them. It may be said, they would have been obstructed at law by the outstanding legal title in <em>Graham, </em>and that the object is to get in the legal title. But this is colourable merely. The debt under the deed of trust having been paid in 1805, the deed would have presented no obstruction. Suppose the sheriff\u2019of <em>Kanawha </em>had brought ejectment against the <em>Ruffners; </em>could they have set up <em>Graham\u2019s </em>title ? Certainly not. For <em>Alder-son </em>could not, and they, being his vendees, are on the same footing. The outstanding satisfied title could not be set up by a tenant to whom it did not belong. Besides, the satisfaction of the mortgage was before forfeiture. This takes away all ground of jurisdiction as against <em>Graham </em>and <em>Ruffners. </em>Can there be any redress against <em>Reynolds? </em>It may be said, the suit is to procure partition between <em>Reynolds </em>and Prior; but equity will not decree partition where the legal title is involved. <em>Stuart\u2019s heirs &amp;c. </em>v. <em>Coalter, </em>4 Rand. 74. <em>Straughan &amp;c. </em>v. <em>Wright &amp;c. </em>Id. 493. <em>Lange </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>5 Leigh 192.</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AzpR\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"734\">*734</page-number>II. It is apparent on the face of the deed to <em>Lewis, </em>that this is a case of maintenance\u2014a case of buying a 'law suit. <em>Lewis </em>was to furnish the fund for carrying on the suit. 5 Bac.

But it will be said, the subject is an equity, and the arrangement is between debtor and creditor, to secure money. A. holds land, claiming title; B. also claims title. B. cannot sell and convey, for this would violate the statute. Will you say, he may bargain to sell and convey, and his bargainee may go into court and sue for the legal title ? or will you say that a man may mortgage that to be sold, which he could not sell himself? To allow either, would be against the policy of the law. The party\u2019s being a creditor will not cleanse the transaction. <em>Allen </em>v. <em>Taylor, </em>lately decided in the court of appeals at <em>Richmond. Morrison </em>v. <em>Campbell &amp;c. </em>2 Rand. 206.</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b754-4\">III. Though the deed to <em>Lewis </em>should be held valid, yet he cannot maintain this suit. <em>Summers </em>and <em>Lewis </em>acquired no title by the deed from the sheriff of <em>Mason. </em>He had no title, and could convey none. Nor did any title remain in <em>Prior. </em>All the estate which belonged to him, whether legal or equitable, was vested in the sheriff of <em>Kanawha. </em>1 Rev.

His account is of such as he thinks might have been made. He does not treat the <em>Ruffners, </em>as tenants in common with <em>Prior </em>have a right to be treated. It is a case in which cotenants have stood by and seen the <em>Ruffners </em>making expensive improvements, and said nothing. The <em>Ruffners </em>w\u2019ere pioneers. They have given value to the land by their labour. Their experiments at length discovered the salt water which gives value to the property.

If the appellants can shew that there would have been no difficulty at law, it avails them nothing, for the clearer the legal title, the smoother the way into equity for partition. But this is a case of tenancy in common. The mere possession of one tenant cannot oust the jurisdiction of equity. Here there is no actual ouster. <em>2 </em>Starkie on Ev. 508. <em>Peaceable </em>v. <em>Reed &amp;c. </em>1 East 558. <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>Horde, </em>1 Burr. 111. The idea seems to be, that the more iniquitous the conduct of the tenant, the less chance there is to get into equity. But in all cases of fraud, not penal, equity has concurrent jurisdiction. <em>Poore </em>v. <em>Price, </em>5 Leigh 52. Ilovenden on Frauds 477-9. It has jurisdiction also on the ground of trust (the trustee having proceeded most irregularly) and likewise under the head of account.</p>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b755-10\">II. The statute against pretensed titles does not apply to equitable titles. Equity will not assist the buyer of a pretensed title, because it is wrong to violate the law; but a court of equity never would refuse its aid to help a creditor to get his debt, where the debtor has placed him in his shoes. It will allow him to get the property and convert it to payment of his debt. <em>Allen &amp;c. </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>1 Leigh 248-254.

I think the court has jurisdiction, because <em>Prior </em>had no legal estate in the moiety of the ten acres, but an equity only: and further, because, if he once had the legal estate, it was divested by his oath of insolvency, and vested by the law in the sheriff of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"737\">*737</page-number><em>Kanawha, </em>where the land lay. It seems to have been the idea, that the deed of the insolvent conveyed his property ; but this is a clear mistake. By the express words of the act, the estate of the insolvent, not only that contained in the schedule, but \u201cany other estate which may be discovered to belong to the prisoner, shall be vested in the sheriff of the county wherein such lands, tenements, goods and chattels shall lie or be foundand this has been the positive law ever since the year 1769, 8 Hen. stat. at large p. 326. Whereas the law requiring the prisoner to deliver up the personal and convey the real estate, was first enacted in .1.799; though not as repealing the other, for they both stand together in the law to the present day. <em>Lewis, </em>then, and <em>Summers, </em>the purchasers under the sale of the sheriff of <em>Mason, </em>acquired no title to the land: it was vested in the sheriff of <em>Kanawha, </em>for the benefit of <em>Edgar </em>the creditor at whose suit <em>Prior </em>was in execution. And the most serious objection I have encountered in this suit, is the fact that the sheriff'of <em>Kanawha </em>was not made a party; a fact which would have had much weight with me, but for what has happened in the court below. There, when the objection was taken, and the court gave leave to amend the bill by making the sheriff a party, it was acknowledged by the defendants that he was dead, aud the necessity of making his representatives parties was expressly waived. Taking this into consideration, and further, that the sheriff is a mere trustee for the benefit of the creditor, and that creditor a plaintiff in the bill praying the aid of the court, I do not think the objection should avail to reverse the decree. It may be further said, thaL this is a suit for the legal title, and also for partition. I am satisfied, both on the subject of parties and jurisdiction. I do not think this a case either of maintenance or pretensed title. It is the case of creditors scuffling for their money, and the debtor willing to help them, by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"738\">*738</page-number>suffering them to aid in the recovery of his, right, not for their profit in the way of speculation, but so far as .the payment of their- just debts may go. In this view it is like the case of <em>Allen &amp;c. </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>1 Leigh 231. and ^ cage tjjere cpe(]; and also the case of <em>Hartley </em>v. <em>Russell, </em>2 Sim. &amp; Stu. 244. 1 Cond. Eng. Ch. Rep. 439.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-5\">I think, however, the accounts have been taken wrong. The <em>Ruffners </em>must be treated as tenants in common with <em>Prior; </em>not as trespassers. They are liable for a fair share of the profits, and entitled to full compensation for their expenses fairly and reasonably incurred, as well those attending their abortive <em>efforts to </em>find water, as their more fortunate ones.</p>\n<author id=\"b758-6\">Tucker, <em>P.</em></author>\n<p id=\"AsQ\">The first question in this case is as to the jurisdiction of the court; and that, I think, is easily disposed of. When <em>Prior </em>took the insolvent debtor\u2019s oath in 1813, his deed for the land in question not only operated nothing, because it was without a sufficient consideration to raise an use and to give effect to a bargain and sale, and because the sheriff of <em>Mason </em>had no right to receive such a deed, but the land itself immediately vested, without deed, in the sheriff of <em>Kanawha </em>county, within which the land lay. 1 Rev. Code, ch. 134. \u00a7 34. p. 538. <em>Shirley </em>v. <em>Long, </em>6 Rand. 735. The consequence was, that <em>Prior's </em>legal title was divested, that the beneficial interest or equitable right to the es.tate was in <em>Edgar </em>the creditor, to, the amount of his demand, and in <em>Prior </em>for the residue. Thus circum.stanced, it was impossible for <em>Edgar </em>or <em>Prior </em>to maintain, an ejectment in their <em>own </em>names. The action indeed might have been brought in the name of the sheriff, if he was alive at the institution of this suit. But if, by analogy to the case of an ordinary trustee and <em>cestui que trust, </em>we even suppose that the creditor and debtor could control and direct <em>this </em>trustee (not a trustee of their own creation, but the creature of the law) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"739\">*739</page-number>yet it would not follow that the <em>cestuis que trust </em>would not have a right <em>to </em>assert their claim in a court of equity. Before the recent act of assembly passed in 1821, even an assignee, and much more a transferree, of a bond might sue in equity, though there was no doubt he might use the obligee\u2019s name and sue also at law. 6 Munf. 23. In the case of a <em>cestui que trust </em>of lands, I am not aware of any case which has deprived him of his right to sue in a court of equity, merely because an action might be maintained by his trustee at law. I am therefore of opinion that the court had jurisdiction, even if the sheriff of <em>Kanawha </em>had been living, which does not appear. As to the obligation on those interested, to hunt up his heirs and sue in their names, and encounter all the embarrassments incident to such a proceeding, it could not surely be insisted on by a court which considers itself the peculiar protector of the rights of the <em>cestui que trust. </em>That court will not turn him from its doors upon such pretences, or involve him in embarrassing litigation to avoid giving him relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-6\">Under this view of the case, it is true, the sheriff or his heirs should in strictness be parties, but the necessity of making them so was expressly waived, as appears by the decree.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-7\">But this is not all. <em>Prior, </em>in my opinion, never had the legal title. The deed of bargain and sale was made to him after the legal title had been passed awa.y by the deed of trust to <em>Graham,: </em>and though that deed was defeated and avoided by the payment in June 1805, before the day of payment arrived, yet between its date and the performance of the condition, the foe was in <em>Graham. </em>For where an estate in fee is conveyed upon condition, so complete is the title of the feoffee or bargainee, that his wife is entitled to dower, though that right will be defeated by entry upon the performance of the condition. 1 Cruise\u2019s Dig. 192. 2 Id. 42. <em>Graham </em>therefore had the feo, and the bargain and sale could only <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"740\">*740</page-number>operate as a contract, and of course gave but the equitable title.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-9\">Believing, from these views of the case, that there is no reasonable doubt of the jurisdiction, I proceed to consider next whether this is a case of maintenance, which is not entitled to the countenance of this court. In support of this position the case of <em>Allen </em>v. <em>Taylor, </em>decided in the court of appeals at <em>Richmond, </em>has been cited, and the case of <em>Morrison </em>v. <em>Campbell &amp;c. 2 </em>Rand. 206.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-11\">I am ready to admit that equity will not enforce an equitable title, purchased by a party under circumstances which, if it were a <em>legal </em>title, would subject him to the penalties of the act against buying and selling a pretensed title; which was the position taken by judge <em>Brooke </em>in <em>Allen &amp;c. </em>v. <em>Smith, 1 </em>Leigh 254. But with this admission I think it perfectly consistent to say that, as a general principle, the act does not apply to every sale and purchase of equitable rights. Such was the decision in that case; and in the case of <em>Wood </em>v. <em>Griffith, </em>1 Swanst. 43. lord <em>Eldon </em>saj's, \u201cIt is extremely clear, lhat an equitable interest under a contract of purchase may be the subject of sale. If I were to suffer the doctrine to be shaken by any reference to the law of champerty, I should violate the established habits of the court.\u201d I do not rest this case, however, upon this general doctrine; for I am free to acknowledge that if <em>Andrew Lewis </em>had, before <em>Prior\u2019s </em>insolvency, purchased of <em>Prior </em>his right, whether it be legal or equitable, while the <em>Ruffners </em>were in possession claiming title whether legal or equitable, this court would not countenance the transaction. <em>That, </em>if I mistake not, was the precise case of <em>Allen </em>v. <em>Taylor. Taylor, </em>there, of his own mere motion, intruded himself, by a voluntary purchase, into the contest between the other parties. But <em>Andrew Lewis, </em>in this case, does not stand before the court in the light of a party who, without other motive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"741\">*741</page-number>than the desire of an advantageous speculation, meddles in the feud of others. He stands, as does <em>Edgar </em>also, in the favoured light of a creditor, who is held to be justified in gathering up the wreck of his debtor\u2019s propcrty, to save himself from sinking. It is with him the <em>tabula in naufragio, </em>and he is justified in seizing it. This distinction is recognized and acted upon by the decision in <em>Allen &amp;c. </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>and also in the case of <em>Hartley </em>v. <em>Russell, </em>2 Sim. &amp; Stu. 244. 1 Cond. Eng. Ch. Rep. 439. That was a case where a creditor, who had sued his debtor, agreed to abandon his suit on the debtor\u2019s giving him a <em>lien </em>on <em>securities in the </em>hands of <em>another creditor, </em>with authority to sue that creditor; and the creditor agreed to use his best endeavours to recover the securities. The court held that the agreement did not amount to champerty, as there was no stipulation that the creditor was to have the <em>profits </em>to be derived by the debtor from the suit. He was only to receive payment of his debt. So here, <em>Andrew Lewis </em>by the terms of his contract is to pay over to <em>Prior </em>the excess after discharging the debt. He is in fact an <em>incumbrancer </em>only, not a <em>purchaser; </em>and I am not aware that a <em>bona fide </em>creditor cannot take a lien on the equitable estate of his debtor, notwithstanding an adverse claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-6\">We have, however, stronger authority for this doctrine than the decided cases. We have the act of assembly. If this be champerty, the <em>statute </em>commits the first act of champerty. It provides that where an insolvent debtor takes the oath of insolvency, the estate contained in his schedule, with any other estate which may be discovered to belong to him, for <em>such interest </em>therein as such prisoner hath, and may lawfully depart withal, shall be vested in the sheriff. No one has ever supposed that a debtor, who had a good title to a tract of land which was in the adverse possession of another, was absolved from surrendering it in his schedule, or that it was not vested in the sheriff. The pretensed title, if such it be, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"742\">*742</page-number>therefore passes <em>it/ the law itself </em>to the sheriff, and he is r , . \u2022 . . moreover required to set it up and sell it to the highest bidder; so that here was an express authority to the sheriff of <em>Kanawha </em>to sell, and to any person to purtbis supposed pretensed title. And why? Because the insolvent debtor being ruined, and his creditors likely to suffer, the law deemed it proper to provide for the disposition of the wreck of his estate for their benefit. And if the purchase of <em>Andrew Lewis </em>at a sheriff\u2019s sale would not have been champerty, by what reason shall it be so adjudged, when, the sheriff being dead, the debtor, with the assent of his creditor, transfers the property, not in absolute ownership, but only as a security for his debts, vesting in one of his creditors the power of prosecuting the demand, as was done in the case already cited of <em>Hartley </em>v. <em>Russell</em>? I cannot, for my own part, conceive; and am therefore of opinion that the transaction is unassailable.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-6\">It has been earnestly objected, that on <em>Lewis\u2019s </em>death, his heirs and not his executors should have been made parties. I think not. The question of title was settled as long ago as 1829, and in 1830 a decree was rendered, confirming the partition made under the former order, and decreeing a conveyance. The cause then proceeded for the rents and profits only, to which the <em>executors </em>were entitled; and they were therefore the proper parties. The act of assembly authorized the revival on <em>motion, </em>and the court having ordered the revival, we must presume the motion to have been made. If the parties in whose name the revival was made were not executors, the defendants could have had no difficulty in contesting the fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-7\">Thus far the case seems to me altogether in favour of the complainants. For the residue, it is in various respects decidedly against them. I have no doubt that in this case the account, as taken under the orders of the court, does the defendants great injustice.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"743\">*743</page-number>First, as to rents and profits : I have no question that in the settlement of them, the <em>Rujfners </em>ought to be treated as tenants in common with <em>Prior </em>and those claiming under him. They claim to hold <em>Reynolds\u2019s </em>interest at a very early period, by contract with him; and therefore held in his right one moiety, while they wrongfully took the exclusive enjoyment and possession of the other moiety, which did not belong to them.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-4\">Out of this relation grows, I think, the principle that they ought not to be charged with rents or profits where none have been made (provided they appear to have employed the property in <em>good </em>faith with a view to make it profitable, but have failed in doing so) nor with speculative profits, where the real profits are susceptible of being ascertained. I am not aware, however, that this relation would have prevented the operation of the statute of limitations, had it been pleaded. But as it was neither pleaded, nor relied on before the commissioner, it must be taken to be out of the case. The party might have pleaded the statute to the bill, or upon the <em>account be </em>might have insisted up <em>on </em>it <em>before </em>the commissioner. For if the defence is set up before the commissioner, the answer to that defence may also be produced. But if the objection be permitted to be made by way of exception only in court, it cannot be properly answered there.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-5\">Secondly, as to improvements: 1 am clearly of opinion that the defendants were not only fairly entitled to a credit for their expenses and actual services (not their invention and talent in contriving the machinery &amp;c.) in the successful operation which terminated in rendering the property of great value, but also for their expenses, labour and services in their unsuccessful experiments. The plaintiffs, if they will have advantage from their successes, must be content to share in their disappointments and failures. He who takes the profit must share the burden. Their works were prose<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"744\">*744</page-number>cuted under the impression that the property was their own. Their <em>bona fides, </em>therefore, cannot be doubted. ,They cannot be suspected of reckless expenditure, or' of wild and extravagant adventures. They appear to been as prudent and sagacious, as zealous and persevering. The plaintiffs are now to have the benefit of the labours of their lives, the fruits of their sagacity, and the harvest of their untiring energy and perseverance. They cannot therefore reasonably object to share in their outlay. For many a sleepless night and anxious day the defendants must still expect to go unpaid, for these admit not of estimate. But what they have expended in the <em>bona fide </em>pursuit of their great and meritorious object, ought to be unstintingly repaid. In taking this account, the expenditure of each year should be offsetted against the rents and profits; and thus we may approximate, at least, to justice between the parties. For thus, whether the act of limitations be or be not relied upon, the claim for improvements in any year will be liquidated, in whole or in part, by the rents and profits of that or'any succeeding year. It remains only to add, that the commissioner has given credit to the <em>Rvffners </em>for the expense of certain permanent improvements,\u2014sinking a gum, boring the rock, tubing it, and reaming: but he has given them no credit for the furnaces and machinery necessary for making salt. These fixtures, as well as the others, were made at the expense of the <em>Ruffhers. </em>It should be ascertained what they were worth at the time partition was made under the decree, and the <em>Ruffners </em>should have credit for one moiety thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-4\">Brockenbrough and Cabell, <em>J. </em>concurred in the opinion of the president.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-5\">Decree reversed, and cause remanded for further proceedings.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
