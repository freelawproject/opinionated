The testator, having first given his whole estate real and personal to <em>Rebecca Crouch for life, </em>afterwards bequeathed as follows\u2014\u201c I give and bequeath, at the death of her the aforesaid <em>Rebecca Crouch, </em>all my personal estate (except my negroes, which are then to be free and at full liberty) to <em>Thomas </em>and <em>Gustams Fakes, </em>to be equally divided between them.\u201d The plaintiffs were children of slaves held by the testator at his death, bom during <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>the life of <em>Rebecca Grouch, </em>who died in 1828. <em>ErsJcine </em>was <em>Mrs. Crouch\u2019s </em>executor, and it was thus that the plaintiffs came into his possession. This state of facts being found in a special verdict, the circuit court held that the plaintiffs were not entitled to their freedom, and gave judgment against them, upon the authority, no doubt, of <em>Maria </em>v. <em>Surba.ugh, </em>2 Rand. 228. The plaintiffs, in December 1832, applied by petition to this court in term time, for a <em>supersedeas </em>to the judgment, which the court denied (upon the same authority, as the reporter knows), and this was entered of record. <em>But in </em>a few days after and at the same term, a motion was made to the court to reconsider the application for the <em>supersedeas, </em>and the court agreed to reconsider it;<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> but no order was entered setting aside the former entry denying the <em>supersedeas, </em>and the case was not mentioned afterwards during that tertp. And now the motion for reconsideration was renewed. The other facts affecting the question of the propriety of the reconsideration asked, are stated in the opinion of <em>the </em>president.</summary>\n<footnote data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b288-4\"> This was in consequence of a doubt, whether the authority of the case of <em>Maria </em>v. <em>Surbaugh </em>was applicable to this case; and from what afterwards transpired in another controversy arising out of the will of the same testator, it appeared to be the opinion both of the bar and of the bench, that it was not applicable, at least not certainly so.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b288-3\">Tucker, <em>P.</em></author>\n<p id=\"An7\">It is within the recollection of the counsel and of one of the bench, that the court did agree to reconsider the application for a <em>supersedeas </em>in this case, at the same term at which it was denied; and the court must presume, I think, that a direction was given to the clerk to make an entry setting aside the order by which it was denied. If not, then there was at least an omission on the part of the court to direct the entry, which was one necessarily consequent upon the agreement to reconsider. If there was such an order, and it was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>omitted to be entered by the clerk, the case seems to be very nearly if not exactly similar to that of <em>Beasley </em>v. <em>Owen, </em>3 Hen. &amp; Munf. 449. There are other cases also in the books, in which similar omissions and mislakes have been remedied at subsequent terms of this court. Such was the case of <em>Thornton v. Corbin, </em>3 Call 232. and such was said by <em>Mr. Call </em>in 3 Hen. &amp; Munf. 449. to have been the case of <em>Murray </em>v. <em>Carrot Sf Co. </em>though the point does not appear in the report of the case in 3 Call 373. We have recently, I think, acted upon the same principle in a case the name of which <em>has </em>escaped <em>me.</em><footnotemark><em>*</em></footnotemark><em> It seems, </em>indeed, essential that this court should exercise the power upon motion of correcting mere clerical errors or omissions in the orders of the court; and 1 should, therefore, be disposed to proceed to reconsider this case, but for some considerations peculiar to it.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-5\">In the first place, this application has been most unreasonably postponed, and for that reason is not entitled to favour. The fact, moreover, that this delay was of purpose, and that the application was considered as abandoned, renders it still more improper at this time to interfere. Whether the paupers are really still prosecuting their claim to freedom or not, we know not; but certain it is, that the interference of <em>Erskine </em>himself (as stated by the counsel) suggesting that the application should be waived, would seem to indicate that the case is under the control of their adversary rather than prosecuted by themselves. This has led me to reflect upon the relation of the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-6\">And here I find, secondly, that according to the special verdict <em>Erskine </em>is not the owner of the plaintiffs, if they are slaves. They were bequeathed by <em>M\u2019 Coy </em>to <em>Mrs. Crouch </em>for life, and after her death <em>to Thomas </em>and <em>George Fakes. Mrs. Grouch </em>held them during her life, when her title ceased. By her will she made <em>Erskine </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>her executor, but as her title expired with her last breath, he had no title to hold them as her executor. su^&gt; tfreref\u00b0reJ is not against the persons entitled. It cannot therefore bind them, if the slaves succeed. ]\\j01. can they take advantage of the judgment if against the slaves; for the effect of a judgment must be mutual, and as they would not be bound by it, so neither can they have advantage of it. The slaves may sue them <em>it/forma pauperis, </em>and this judgment will be no bar if they can shew title to their freedom. It is, therefore, evidently of no importance to the slaves to allow this appeal; and I am therefore of opinion that the motion to reconsider be rejected, as the reconsideration would ' be nugatory.</p>\n<author id=\"b290-7\">Carr, <em>J.</em></author>\n<p id=\"AOab\">Without admitting or denying the power of the court to correct errors of this sort, after the term (a question on which I have not made up my mind), I am clearly of opinion that it is a power which ought to be very cautiously exercised,\u2014in cases only where <em>the </em>mistake is very clearly made out, and the application very recent; neither of which marks the case before . us. I am therefore decidedly of opinion, that we ought not now to look into the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-8\">The other judges concurring in refusing to reconsider the application for a <em>supersedeas, </em>motion overruled.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b289-7\">Note by reporter.
