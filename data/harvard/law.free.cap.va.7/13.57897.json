The testator\u2019s son, <em>Thomas Roney </em>the younger, having attained to full age, the widow and executrix put into his possession five slaves, which before his death increased' to. ten. He died before his mother, leaving a <em>widow, Mary Roney, </em>and two infant children, <em>Emetine </em>and <em>Elizabeth Roney. </em>His brother <em>Robert Roney </em>took administration of his estate, and delivered back the ten slaves to the testator\u2019s widow and executrix, who held them till her death. She died not long afterwards, intestate. The only children of the testator living at her death, were <em>Robert, Patrick, Isaac </em>and <em>Polly Roney.

but that the defendants, claiming as the only children of the testator, <em>Thomas Roney </em>the elder, who survived his widow, had, after her death, divided those slaves among themselves, as well as all the other personal estate of that testator: insisting, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>that those ten slaves, at least, were the property of <em>Thomas </em>the younger, and the plaintiffs were entitled to distribution thereof as his estate; and further, that upon the true construction of the will of <em>Thomas </em>the elder, the heirs of <em>Thomas </em>the younger, notwithstanding his death before the widow, were entitled to an equal share of the real estate with the other sons to whom it was devised in remainder, and his distributees entitled to an equal share of all the slaves and other personal estate of the testator with the other children to whom the same was bequeathed in remainder: and praying, therefore, a decree for the ten slaves and their increase and profits, and for their just and equal share of all the other personal estate of <em>Thomas </em>the elder, and of the real estate devised by him to his five sons in remainder, and an account and division of <em>Rebecca Roney's </em>estate.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b35-3\">The defendants, in their answers, alleged, that <em>Rebecca Roney </em>only lent the slaves in question to her son <em>Thomas </em>when he attained to full age; but that, whatever her intention in putting them into his possession, might have been, she had no right to give him those slaves in absolute property, for that by the will of <em>Thomas </em>the elder, those slaves and all his other personal estate passed, at her death, to the children of that testator, who were then living; and that as to the real estate devised to the five sons in remainder, that also passed to <em>Patrick </em>and <em>Isaac Roney, </em>the only two of the five devisees, who survived their mother.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b35-4\">There was parol evidence in the cause, in respect to the delivery of the slaves by the widow to her son <em>Thomas </em>in his lifetime; the weight of which, in the opinion of this court, was, that the son always considered that he held the property on loan from his mother.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b35-5\">The chancellor declared, that the five slaves delivered by the widow to <em>Thomas Roney </em>the younger in his lifetime, and their increase, were his absolute property, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>which devolved to his administrator, as assets for payment of his debts, and for distribution among the plaintiffs, but that the plaintiffs were not entitled to any share of any other part of the testator <em>Thomas </em>the elder\u2019s estate, real or personal: therefore, he decreed, that those slaves and their increase should be delivered to the plaintiffs, to be by them held as part of <em>Thomas </em>the younger\u2019s estate; and he directed accounts of the profits of the slaves in question since the death of <em>Thomas </em>the younger, and of <em>Robert Roney\u2019s </em>administration of his estate, and of <em>Isaac Roney\u2019s </em>administration of <em>Rebecca Roney\u2019s </em>estate.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b36-4\">The defendants applied by petition to this court, for an appeal from the decree, which was allowed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b36-5\"><em>Robinson, </em>for the appellants.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b36-6\"><em>Spooner, </em>for the appellees.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b36-7\">Carr, <em>J.</em></author>\n<p id=\"AqyK\">In the construction of wills, we must always keep in mind, that the property is the testator\u2019s own; that his control over it is only limited by the law; that he may give it in equal or unequal portions among his children, or disinherit, at his will or caprice, any or all of them. We are not to make up our opinion as to what seems to us a just distribution, and then bend the will to suit our own conceptions; but to ascertain from his words, the meaning of the testator, and make that our law, 'wherever it does not violate some rule of the general law. I make these remarks, because, at' the first blush of the case, I felt inclined (as I believe most persons would) to take sides with the widow and daughters of the son <em>Thomas. </em>It seemed hard,' that the misfortune of losing their husband and father, should cut them off from all share of the estate, because he died before his mother. A careful examination of the case, however, has compelled me to believe, that the testator has so willed it.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>In this will of <em>Thomas Roney </em>the elder, there are two purposes of the test\u00e1tor very clearly expressed: 1. that his wife should have the use and profits of his whole estate not before disposed of, during her widowhood; <em>2. </em>that when her right ceased, either by marriage or death, the land should be divided among the five sons whom he names, or so many of them as should be then living, and the personal estate among the nine children named, or so many of them as should be then living. It is contended, however, that by the words \u201c desiring that she shall share out such a part to each child, as they come of age, as shall seem most convenient\u201d &amp;c. the testator has created in each child a right to an equal portion of the personalty, vesting in each as he came of age, and which each at that age would have a right to call for: and a great many cases have been cited to shew that words of recommendation and desire amount to a bequest, and create a trust. There is no doubt that this is sound law. In <em>Malim </em>v. <em>Keighley, 2 </em>Ves. jun. 335. the master of the rolls lays it down thus broadly: \u201cIf a testator shews his desire that a thing shall be done, unless there are plain express words or necessary implication, that he does not mean to take away the discretion, but intends to leave it to be defeated, the party shall be considered as acting under a trust.\u201d But here, I think, there are such words. We are always so to construe a will as to make all the words stand together, if possible, and to give every part of the will effect. If we say, that each child, as he came of age, had a vested right to take his share, and could instantly enforce that right, what becomes of that part of the will, which, in the most explicit terms, gives the whole to the wife during her widowhood? We expunge it. Again; what do we do with that part of it which says, that when the wife\u2019s interest ends, the whole personalty shall be divided among the nine children, <em>or so many of them, as shall be then living </em>? clearly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>fixing the time of division, and making the share of . \u00b0 each depend upon the contingency of his surviving the mother. These words of contingency are twice repeated in the will; shewing a settled intention in the testator, both as regarded the realty and the personalty. Indeed, the whole scheme of the will, would, as it seems to me, be destroyed by this construction. It is not then to be tolerated, if by any other way we can preserve the scheme, and give a rational meaning to all the words ; and this (I think) is easy in the present case. The testator gives the whole to his <em>wife; </em>but it may well comport with this, that he should wish her, either from her profits, or by a loan of part of the slaves, to share out to each child, as he came of age, such part as might seem most convenient, to help him along; the property thus loaned, to be subject to division at her marriage or death, to and among such of the nine children as should be then living. This reconciles the whole will ; and this seems to have been the cotemporaneous understanding, for the weight of proof is that the son <em>Thomas </em>always considered that he held the slaves on loan.</p>\n<p id=\"Aro\">Brockenbrough, <em>J. </em>and Tucker, <em>P. </em>concurred. Decree reversed; bill dismissed as to all the defendants, except the administrator of <em>Rebecca Roney; </em>and cause remanded for further proceedings against that defendant.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
