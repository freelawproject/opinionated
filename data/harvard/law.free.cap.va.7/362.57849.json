Plea, the general issue, put in by the defendant <em>Garland </em>alone. At the trial the defendant demurred to the evidence, which was as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b382-10\">1st, An <em>account </em>between the estate of <em>Agee, </em>the plaintiff\u2019s intestate, and <em>Garland Sf Freeland, </em>which had been filed with the declaration, and in which five hogsheads of tobacco were credited to <em>Agee </em>at the price of 456 dollars, reduced by debits to a balance of 298 dollars, and it appeared by a debit in the account dated the 25th October 1823, that it was rendered after that date. 2ndly, The testimony of a witness (who had been retained as the defendant\u2019s counsel since the institution of this suit) that the account abovementioned was wholly in the handwriting of one <em>Ferguson, </em>who had been for many years previous to May 1823 the clerk of <em>Garland Sf Freeland; </em>that the partnership of <em>Garland Sf Freeland </em>was dissolved about the 27th May 1S23, the dissolution to take effect from the 1st of that month; and at the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>same time, <em>Garland </em>sold all his interest in the concern <em>.. </em>of <em>Garland of Freeland, </em>and m another firm o\u00ed <em>1* reeland, Wingfield, Sf Co. </em>to Freeland, who undertook to pay all the debts, and was entitled by contract to all <em>Garland\u2019s </em>rights: that after <em>Freeland </em>had thus bought <em>Garland\u2019s </em>interest, <em>Freeland </em>took possession of all the books, papers &amp;c. and it was understood that <em>Garland </em>was to have nothing further to do with them: that the witness supposed he had seen the dissolution of the partnership of <em>Garland fy Freeland </em>published, immediately after it took place, in the <em>Lynchburg </em>newspapers, since he had been under that impression ever since, and the dissolution was matter of notoriety in the neighbourhood where the plaintiff\u2019s intestate lived : that <em>Ferguson </em>(in whose handwriting the account, offered in evidence by the plaintiff, was) continued to be the agent of <em>Freeland </em>for many months after the dissolution of <em>Garland Sf Free-land, </em>but was not the agent of <em>Garland </em>as a partner of <em>Garland, &amp;f Freeland, or </em>otherwise, for <em>Garland </em>had no confidence in him : that <em>Ferguson </em>was now a resident of Missouri: that the witness, since he had been retained as counsel for the defendant in this suit, as well as before, had had access to the books of <em>Garland &amp;p Freeland, </em>and there was an account in the books in the name of the plaintiff\u2019s intestate, but the witness did not remember how the balance stood or what the items were [the books were not produced] : and that <em>Freeland, </em>who was the' acting partner of <em>Garland &amp;f Freeland, </em>was extremely careless about making entries on the books; and, in a great many instances, the balances shewn by the books were incorrect for want of proper entries of the transactions, such as entries of debits and credits, which were often supplied, when called for, from memory or loose memorandums, and, sometimes, no accurate information of them could be obtained in any way. And 3rdly, the testimony of another witness, that notice of the dissolution was published in the <em>Lynchburg </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number><em>Virginian, </em>shortly after May 1823 [but no newspaper containing the publication was produced]. And this being all the evidence on both sides, the defendant demurred thereto, and the plaintiff joined in the demurrer.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b384-4\">The jury found a verdict for the plaintiff for 298 dollars, with interest &amp;c. subject to the opinion of the court on the demurrer to evidence. The court gave judgment on the demurrer, for the plaintiff. The defendant appealed to the circuit court, which affirmed the judgment ; and then he applied to this court for a <em>supersedeas, </em>which was allowed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b384-5\"><em>Garland, </em>for the plaintiff in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A1\">The account rendered in <em>Ferguson\u2019s </em>handwriting, appears, on its face, to have been rendered five months after the dissolution of the partnership of <em>Garland Sf Freeland. </em>The agency of <em>Ferguson </em>for that house ceased upon the dissolution, and he had no authority to do any act binding upon it. And if it may be inferred that <em>Freeland </em>authorized <em>Ferguson </em>to render this account, the act was nowise binding on <em>Garland, </em>because <em>Freeland </em>himself could not, after the dissolution, make any promise or settlement, or any entries on the books, that could bind <em>Garland, </em>without his assent. <em>Shelton </em>v. <em>Cocke, Crawford &amp; Co. </em>3 Munf. 191. <em>Rootes </em>v. <em>Wellford &amp; Co. </em>4 Munf. 216., <em>Simonton\u2019s assignees </em>v. <em>Boucher &amp; al. </em>2 Wash.

But admitting the dissolution, and due publication of the notice of it, yet the account shewing the debt due to <em>Agee </em>from <em>Garland &amp; Freeland, </em>though rendered by <em>Freeland </em>or (which is the same thing) by <em>Ferguson </em>his clerk, after the dissolution, was competent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>evidence of the debt. For even after the dissolution of a partnership, the partnership must in legal contemplation have an existence, so far as respects the winding up of its affairs, until they are settled, and outstanding engagements made good. <em>Brown\u2019s ex\u2019or </em>v. <em>Higginbotham &amp; Co. </em>5 Leigh 583.588. An admission made by one partner after dissolution, concerning joint contracts made during the partnership, is evidence to charge the other partner: for when a partnership is dissolved, it is only dissolved with regard to things future; with regard to things past, the partnership continues, and must always continue. <em>Wood &amp;c. </em>v. Braddick, 1 Taunt. 104. <em>Brockenbrough </em>v. <em>Hackley, </em>6 Call 51. Besides, the jury might fairly have inferred from the evidence stated in the demurrer, and therefore the court must infer, that when, upon the dissolution of <em>Garland Freeland, Garland </em>left it to <em>Freeland </em>to settle and pay the partnership debts, lie gave him full authority to render accounts of, or otherwise acknowledge, such debts as were due from the partnership.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b385-9\">Pur curiam.</author>\n<p id=\"b385-10\">The judgment is to be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
